We report the molecular cloning of a novel isoform of p38 MAP kinase, p38β2. This p38 MAP kinase, like p38α, is inhibited by the pyridinyl imidazole drug SB203580. The p38 MAP kinase kinase MKK6 is identified as a common activator of p38α, p38β2, and p38γ MAP kinase isoforms, while MKK3 activates only p38α and p38γ MAP kinase isoforms. The MKK3 and MKK6 signal transduction pathways are therefore coupled to distinct, but overlapping, groups of p38 MAP kinases.

Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Three groups of mammalian MAP kinases have been studied in detail: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) (2Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) (3Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), and the p38 MAP kinases (3Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The ERKs are robustly activated by growth factors and phorbol ester, but are only weakly activated by cytokines and environmental stress. In contrast, JNK and p38 MAP kinases are strongly activated by cytokines and environmental stress, but are poorly activated by growth factors and phorbol ester. Recently, progress toward understanding the physiological role of the p38 MAP kinases has been achieved through the use of drugs that bind p38 MAP kinase (4Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C.

The targets of p38 MAP kinase that mediate these responses are poorly characterized. However, biochemical studies indicate that p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway activates the transcription factors CREB and ATF1 (9Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3663-3671Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar). These p38 MAP kinases are widely expressed in many tissues and are activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr within the motif Thr-Gly-Tyr located in kinase subdomain VIII (12Raingeaud J.

This phosphorylation is mediated by a protein kinase cascade (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Components of this signaling pathway include the MAP kinase kinases MKK3 (30Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) and MKK6 (11Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11427-11433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is also possible that MKK4 contributes to the activation of p38 MAP kinase. In vitro studies demonstrate that MKK4 activates both JNK and p38 MAP kinases (30Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar, 34Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). However, the role of MKK4 as an activator of p38 MAP kinase in vivo is unclear (35Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.-T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The activation of MKK3 and MKK6 is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser and Thr residues within subdomain VIII by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MKKK) (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to define the function and specificity of MKKKs that cause activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. However, one candidate MKKK for the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway is TAK1, which has been reported to activate MKK3 and MKK6 (36Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N.

Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Other MKKKs, which activate both JNK and p38 MAP kinases, include ASK-1 (39Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) and the mixed-lineage kinase MLK-3 (40Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 41Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Other MKKKs that activate the JNK signaling pathway, for example MEKK1, do not cause activation of p38 MAP kinase (30Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar, 34Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The expression of multiple p38 MAP kinase isoforms in mammalian tissues suggests that these MAP kinases may differ in their physiological function. These p38 MAP kinases may be coupled to different upstream signaling pathways. This would enable the activation of specific p38 MAP kinase isoforms in response to different stimuli. Alternatively, these p38 MAP kinase isoforms may differ in their substrate specificity. Such differences could allow coupling of different p38 MAP kinase isoforms to different signal transduction targets. The purpose of this study was to examine the p38β MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. We find that p38β MAP kinase (23Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) is not a functional protein kinase in vitro or in vivo. However, a novel p38β MAP kinase isoform (p38β2) that was isolated from a human brain cDNA library encoded a functional protein kinase. This novel p38 MAP kinase isoform was inhibited by pyridinyl imidazole drugs. The MAP kinase kinase MKK6 activated p38α, p38β2, and p38γ, while MKK3 activated only p38α and p38γ. The lack of activation of p38β2 by MKK3 was due to its inability to phosphorylate p38β2. These data demonstrate that the p38β2 MAP kinase is selectively activated by MKK6. We conclude that different p38 MAP kinase isoforms are regulated by overlapping and distinct signal transduction pathways. IL-1α and TNF-α were from Genzyme Corp. MBP was from Sigma.

A human p38α cDNA was isolated from a fetal brain library by RT-PCR using primers specific for the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. This cDNA was subcloned in the vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen Inc.) and sequenced. The human p38α MAP kinase cDNA was labeled with [32P]phosphate by random priming and was used to screen a human fetal brain library cloned in the phage λZAPII (Stratagene). Two clones related to p38β1 (designated p38β2) were isolated and sequenced. The mammalian expression vector and the bacterial expression vector for p38α, p38β1, p38β2, and p38γ MAP kinase were constructed by subcloning the cDNA in the plasmids pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pGSTag (46Dressler H. Ron D. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The Flag epitope (-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-; Immunex Corp.) was inserted between codons 1 and 2 of the p38 MAP kinases by insertional overlapping PCR (47Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The sequence of each plasmid was confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 373A machine. The GST-p38 fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose (48Smith S.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. HeLa and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA (0.1–1.0 μg) was transfected by the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The cells were harvested after 48 h of incubation. Cells were solubilized with buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.137 m NaCl, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g (15 min at 4 °C). Epitope-tagged protein kinases were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with the M2 Flag monoclonal antibody (IBI-Kodak) bound to protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia-LKB Biotechnology, Inc). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein kinase assays were performed using recombinant protein kinases and protein kinase immunoprecipitates. The reactions were initiated by addition of 1 μg of substrate proteins and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 40 μl of kinase buffer. The phosphorylation reaction was linear with time for at least 40 min. The reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was examined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Inc.), and probed with the M2 monoclonal antibody to the Flag epitope (IBI-Kodak), a monoclonal antibody to MKK4 (Pharmingen), and an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to phospho-Ser-383 Elk-1 (New England Biolabs). Immunocomplexes were detected using chemiluminescence (Lumiglo; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Transfection assays were performed using CHO cells and the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pGAL4-Elk-1 (45Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) and 0.2 μg of the reporter plasmid pG5E1bLuc (49Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J.

Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection of the cells with the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Pharmacia-LKB). The effect of co-transfection with 100 ng of expression vectors for p38 MAP kinase, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, or the empty expression vector was examined. The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. The β-galactosidase and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured as described previously (45Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). To identify novel members of the human p38 MAP kinase group, we used a human p38α MAP kinase cDNA as a probe to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. Two cDNA clones related to p38α MAP kinase were identified. Partial sequence analysis demonstrated that these clones were identical to the p38β MAP kinase reported by Jiang et al. (23Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, following completion of the sequence analysis, it was apparent that the novel cDNAs differed from p38β MAP kinase. A deletion of 24 base pairs was detected in the sequence of the novel clones compared with p38β MAP kinase. This gap results in the deletion of an 8-amino acid insertion present in p38β MAP kinase (23Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). We designate the novel sequence as p38β2 and the previously reported sequence p38β1 (Fig. 1). It is possible that the 8-amino acid deletion was the result of alternative splicing. To test this hypothesis, we performed RT-PCR using primers that span the deletion (5′-TCCATCGAGGACTTCAGCGAAGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCTGGCGCGCCAGCCCGAAATC-3′). Sequence analysis of the products of amplification of human brain mRNA led to the identification of p38β2, but not p38β1. These data demonstrate that in human brain p38β2 is the major p38β isoform. It is possible that p38β1 may be expressed in other tissues. The phosphorylation of ATF2 by p38α MAP kinase has been studied in detail (11Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 12Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether ATF2 was a substrate for p38β2. In vitro protein kinase assays using recombinant p38β2 demonstrated that this protein kinase did autophosphorylate (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, control studies using recombinant p38β1 did not demonstrate autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). Addition of ATF2 resulted in phosphorylation by p38β2, but not by p38β1 (Fig.2 A). These data suggest that p38β2 is a more active protein kinase than p38β1. The absence of protein kinase activity detected for p38β1 in vitro may not represent the activity of this protein kinasein vivo. We therefore tested the activity of p38β1 and p38β2 in vivo. Equal amounts of these p38 MAP kinase isoforms were expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 B). Exposure to UV-C radiation caused increased protein kinase activity of p38β2, but not p38β1 (Fig. 2 B). Control experiments demonstrated that UV-activated p38β2 was less active than UV-activated p38α or p38γ (Fig. 2 B). The absence of p38β1 activity and the low level of p38β2 activity compared with p38α and p38γ may indicate that UV radiation is a poor activator of p38β1 and p38β2 protein kinase activity. We therefore examined the activity of the p38β MAP kinase isoforms in co-transfection experiments with constitutively activated MKK6, a strong activator of p38 MAP kinases (11Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that the activation of p38β2 MAP kinase was similar to the activation of p38α and p38γ MAP kinases (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the p38β1 MAP kinase isoform was inactive in this assay (Fig. 2 C). We immunopurified p38α, p38β2, and p38γ MAP kinases from control and UV-irradiated cells. The amount of each Flag-tagged p38 MAP kinase was examined by immunoblot analysis using the M2 monoclonal antibody. An equal amount of each p38 MAP kinase isoform was used for in vitro protein kinase assays using different substrates. This analysis demonstrated that ATF2, Elk-1, and MBP were phosphorylated by p38β2 (Fig. 3 A). ATF2, Elk-1, and MBP were also phosphorylated by p38α and p38γ MAP kinases (Fig. 3 A). The extent of substrate phosphorylation by p38β2 was less than p38α and p38γ. However, the fold-activation of p38β2 activity was similar to that detected for p38α and p38γ (Fig. 3 A). These data indicate that the substrate specificity of these p38 MAP kinase isoforms was similar. To further examine the substrate specificity of p38β2 MAP kinase, we examined the phosphorylation of two other substrates for stress-activated MAP kinases. First, the transcription factor c-Jun, which is phosphorylated by JNK (3Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). We found that c-Jun was not phosphorylated by any of the p38 MAP kinase isoforms tested (data not shown). In a second series of experiments, we examined the phosphorylation of the protein kinase Mapkap-K2, which is reported to be a substrate for p38 MAP kinase (16Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 17Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that p38α MAP kinase, but not p38β2 or p38γ, phosphorylated Mapkap-K2 (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the p38β2 MAP kinase substrate specificity differs from p38α MAP kinase. The results of substrate analysis indicate that the substrate specificity of p38β2 MAP kinase was similar to p38γ (Fig.3 A). However, this analysis of substrate phosphorylation does not take account of the sites of phosphorylation of each protein. We therefore performed more detailed analysis of p38β2 MAP kinase activity using the transcription factor ATF2 as the substrate. ATF2 was found to be a substrate for p38α, p38β2, and p38γ MAP kinase (Fig. 3 A). We have previously reported that p38α MAP kinase phosphorylates ATF2 on Thr-69 and Thr-71 (12Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis confirmed this conclusion. Replacement of Thr-69 or Thr-71 with Ala caused decreased phosphorylation of ATF2, while replacement of both phosphorylation sites with Ala eliminated ATF2 phosphorylation by p38α MAP kinase (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, experiments using p38γ MAP kinase demonstrated that the replacement of Thr-71 with Ala caused a marked decrease in ATF2 phosphorylation, while replacement of Thr-69 with Ala increased ATF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that either Thr-71 is the major site of ATF2 phosphorylation by p38γ MAP kinase, or that the phosphorylation of Thr-71 precedes the phosphorylation of other sites by p38γ MAP kinase. Comparative studies using p38β2 MAP kinase demonstrate that this MAP kinase isoform differs from both p38α and p38γ MAP kinase isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2045401053,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPKAP-K1; also known as p90 rsk ) contains two protein kinase domains in a single polypeptide. The N-terminal kinase domain is necessary for the phosphorylation of peptide substrates, whereas the C-terminal kinase domain is required for full activation of the N-terminal domain. Here we identify six sites in MAPKAP-K1a that become phosphorylated in transfected COS-1 cells. The inactive form of MAPKAP-K1a in unstimulated cells is partially phosphorylated at Ser222 and Ser733. Stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces the phosphorylation of Thr360, Ser364, Thr574, and Ser381 and increases the phosphorylation of Ser222 and Ser733. Our data indicate that mitogen-activated protein kinase activates the C-terminal kinase domain by phosphorylating Thr574 and contributes to the activation of the N-terminal kinase domain by phosphorylating Ser364. The activated C-terminal domain phosphorylates Ser381, which, together with phosphorylation of Ser364, activates the N-terminal kinase domain. The phosphorylation of Ser222and Ser733, which can be catalyzed by the N-terminal domain, does not activate MAPKAP-K1a per se, but Ser222 phosphorylation appears to be required for activation. Ser222, Ser364, and Ser381 are situated in analogous positions to phosphorylation sites in protein kinase B, protein kinase C, and p70S6K, suggesting a common mechanism of activation for these growth factor-stimulated protein kinases.

As implied by their name, the isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPKAP-K1 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKAP-K1, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; NTD, N-terminal kinase domain; CTD, C-terminal kinase domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. ; also known as p90 rsk ) are only active in vitro if they have been phosphorylated by the p42 or p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (1Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the MAPKAP-K1 isoforms are also activated by MAPKs in vivo via the Ras-dependent protein kinase cascade that is triggered by growth factors or tumor-promoting phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Thus, signals that activate MAPKs also activate MAPKAP-K1, and the phosphorylation (2Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatracasas P. Saltiel A. J.

Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), the major upstream activator of MAPKs. Cyclic AMP-elevating agents that prevent the activation of MAPKs also prevent the activation of MAPKAP-K1 (4Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). MAPKAP-K1 has a broad substrate specificity in vitro, phosphorylating proteins and peptides at serine residues that lie in Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser or Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser motifs (5Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Donella-Deana A. Lavoinne A. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, few physiological substrates have been identified so far. Upon activation, MAPKAP-K1 is known to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus (7Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where one of its substrates in neuronal cells is believed to be the transcription factor CREB (reviewed in Ref. 8Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Activation of CREB by MAPKAP-K1 is intriguing because MAPKs are highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons, where they are activated by agonists known to play a role in memory formation (9English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and an important role for CREB phosphorylation in memory formation is well documented (10Carew T.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, inactivating mutations in the gene encoding human MAPKAP-K1b (RSK2) are associated with Coffin-Lowry syndrome, a disease that results in severe mental retardation as well as progressive skeletal deformation (11Trivier E. De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Pannetier S. Zackal E. Young I. Mandel J.-L. Sassone-Corsi P. Hanauer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A role of the MAPK cascade in long-term facilitation inAplysia has also been reported recently (12Martin K.C. Michael D. Rose J.C. Barad M. Casadio A. Zhu H. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 899-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). MAPKAP-K1 is unusual in that the polypeptide contains two distinct protein kinase domains (13Jones S.W. Erikson E. Blenis J. Maller J.L. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The N-terminal kinase domain (NTD) is most similar to p70S6K (almost 60% amino acid sequence identity) (14Banerjee P. Ahmad M.F. Grove J.R. Kozlosky C. Price D.J. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8550-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal kinase domain (CTD) is most similar to phosphorylase kinase (40% amino acid sequence identity). The ability of MAPKAP-K1 to phosphorylate a variety of exogenous substrates is abolished by single amino acid replacements that inactivate the NTD (5Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Bjørbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the CTD greatly reduces, but does not abolish, the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates (5Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Bjørbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18848-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These observations and the finding that the isolated CTD is capable of phosphorylating itself (16Fischer T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) suggest that the CTD may play a role in the activation of the NTD. Indeed, evidence that MAPKAP-K1 can be autophosphorylated by either the NTD or the CTD has been presented (15Bjørbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18848-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Several years ago, we identified a threonine in the CTD of MAPKAP-K1b (Thr574 in MAPKAP-K1a) as one of the residues phosphorylated by MAPKs in vitro (17Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, others (15Bjørbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18848-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) found that the mutation of this residue to Ala in MAPKAP-K1c (RSK3) generated an enzyme that could still be activated in response to the epidermal growth factor. This finding prompted us to identify all the sites in MAPKAP-K1a (RSK1) that become phosphorylated in vivo. Here we identify six phosphorylation sites in PMA-stimulated COS-1 cells, three of which are phosphorylated by MAPKs in vitro. Our results indicate that the MAPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser364 and Thr574 is critical for activation of the NTD and CTD, respectively, and that the phosphorylation of Ser381, catalyzed by the CTD, is also important for activation of the NTD.

Escherichia coli cells (BL21(DE3) pLys S) expressing the rat glutathioneS-transferase (GST), hemagglutinin-tagged (HA) MAPKAP-K1a fusion protein were grown at 37 °C in LB medium in a 25-liter fermenter until the cells reached an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. The temperature was reduced to 28 °C, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 30 μm. The bacteria were grown for a further 5 h, pelleted at 5000 × g, and lysed, and GST-HA-MAPKAP-K1a was purified on glutathione-agarose (18Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Leevers S. Cowley S. Marshall C.J.

The yield of full-length fusion protein (108 kDa), which composed ∼10% of the final material, was 20 μg/liter of bacterial culture. Human MAPKAP-K2 (residues 46–400) was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein and activated with p38/reactivating kinase MAPK (19Ben-Levy R. Leighton I.A. Doza Y.N. Attwood P. Morrice N.

Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Model 430A peptide synthesizer by Dr. G. Bloomberg (University of Bristol). All antibodies were raised in sheep at the Scottish Antibody Production Unit (Lanarkshire, UK). One antibody was raised against the peptide RNQSPVLEPVGRSTLAQRRGIKK (corresponding to the last 23 residues of rabbit MAPKAP-K1b) and affinity-purified on peptide CH-Sepharose columns. Antibodies that recognize specific phosphorylation sites in rat MAPKAP-K1a were raised against the following peptides: FTSRT*PRDSP (Thr360), RTPRDS*PGIP (Ser364), and FRGFS*FVATG (Ser381), where T* and S* signify phosphorylated threonine and serine, respectively. These antibodies were affinity-purified on peptide CH-Sepharose columns. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-sheep IgG were purchased from the Scottish Antibody Production Unit. Immunoblotting was performed as described (20Traverse S. Cohen P. Paterson H. Marshall C. Rapp U. Grand R.J.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3175-3181PubMed Google Scholar).

The cells were washed and lysed (5Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P.

One unit of MAPKAP-K1 activity is that amount which incorporates 1 nmol of phosphate into the substrate peptide in 1 min. Cells transfected with HA-MAPKAP-K1a were washed three times in phosphate-free medium, incubated for 1 h, and washed twice more in the same medium. The cells were then incubated for 4 h with carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) in the presence or absence of PD 98059. After appropriate stimulation, the cells were washed four times with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified essential medium and then lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20 °C), 0.1% (by volume) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% (by mass) Triton X-100, 0.25 m NaCl, Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer), 1 mm sodium orthopervanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 0.27 m sucrose). The lysates were incubated with agitation for 30 min at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose incubated with preimmune sheep serum and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was added to protein G-Sepharose coupled to monoclonal antibody 12CA5, which recognizes the HA epitope. After agitation for 90 min at 4 °C, the complex was washed eight times with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and then twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% (by volume) 2-hydroxyethanethiol. Immunoprecipitated32P-labeled HA-MAPKAP-K1a was denatured in SDS and resolved by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After autoradiography, the 86-kDa band corresponding to phosphorylated HA-MAPKAP-K1a was excised, eluted, precipitated, and oxidized as described (24Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The protein was then incubated at 30 °C in 0.3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (20 °C), and 0.1% (by volume) reduced Triton X-100 containing 5 μg of trypsin or chymotrypsin. After 3 h, another 5 μg of protease was added, and the suspension was left for a further 12 h. Guanidinium chloride (8m) was added to a final concentration of 1 m to precipitate any residual SDS, and after standing on ice for 10 min, the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant containing >90% of the 32P radioactivity was removed and fractionated as described below. A tryptic digest of32P-labeled HA-MAPKAP-K1a obtained from 8 mg of cell lysate was first purified on a column of chelating Sepharose (Pharmacia) saturated with iron(III) chloride (25Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptides were recovered (70% yield) by elution with water/ethanol/triethylamine, pH 10.5; dried; redissolved in 0.1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid; and applied to a 24 cm × 4-mm Vydac 218TP54 C18 column (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid and connected to an on-line monitor for continuous measurement of 32P radioactivity. The column was developed with a linear acetonitrile gradient (0.33%/min) in 0.1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. Typically, >80% of the 32P radioactivity applied to the column was recovered. Six major tryptic peptides (T1–T6) and chymotryptic peptides (C1–C6) were obtained. Peptide T1 was further purified by chromatography on a microbore C18 column equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, and aliquots of peptides T1, T2, and T5 were then analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Model 476A sequencer to determine the amino acid sequence. Additional aliquots of peptides T1–T6 and chymotryptic peptides C1–C6 were coupled covalently to a Sequelon arylamine membrane and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Model 470A sequencer. 32P radioactivity was measured after each cycle of Edman degradation. Bacterially expressed GST-HA-MAPKAP-K1a was phosphorylated by incubation for 1 h with GST-MAPKAP-K2 (30 units/ml) or GST-MAPK (20 units/ml) in 50 mm Mops-HCl, pH 7.0 (20 °C), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (by volume) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% (by mass) Brij-35, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol). After denaturation in SDS and electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, 32P-labeled full-length GST-MAPKAP-K1a produced by phosphorylation with MAPKAP-K2 was excised, digested with trypsin, and chromatographed on the C18 column as described above. The two major 32P-labeled peptides eluting at 18.5% acetonitrile (peptide T1) and 27.7% acetonitrile (peptide T5) were further purified by chromatography on the microbore C18column at pH 6.5, and their amino acid sequences were determined. MAPKAP-K1a could only be expressed in E. coli in very low yield, was highly degraded (see “Experimental Procedures”), and could not be activated to a significant extent by p42 MAPK. For these reasons, the mechanism of activation of MAPKAP-K1a was studied by transiently transfecting the cDNA into COS-1 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged enzyme from the cell lysates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Following stimulation of the cells with 80 nm PMA, the activity of transfected HA-MAPKAP-K1a increased 10–15-fold, peaking after 10–15 min, similar to the activation of the endogenous MAPKAP-K1 activity (Fig.1). The rate of activation of the expressed and endogenous enzymes was strongly suppressed by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the activation of MAPK kinase-1 (3Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), indicating that the activation of MAPKAP-K1 is catalyzed by MAPKs. The failure of PD 98059 to suppress the PMA-induced activation of MAPKAP-K1 completely has been noted previously in Swiss 3T3 cells (3Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) and is likely to be explained by the finding that PD 98059 inhibits the activation of MAPK kinase by only 80–90%. Due to the enormous amplification potential of the MAPK cascade, the 10–20% residual MAPK kinase activity is sufficient to induce significant activation of MAPKAP-K1. However, the possibility that another PMA-activated PD 98059-insensitive kinase cascade may also contribute to the activation of MAPKAP-K1 cannot be excluded. The activity of transfected HA-MAPKAP-K1a was 10-fold higher than the endogenous MAPKAP-K1 activity after stimulation with PMA (Fig. 1), even though the efficiency of transfection was only 30%. Thus, the intracellular concentration of HA-MAPKAP-K1a is far higher than that of the endogenous MAPKAP-K1. All the experiments presented below were carried out on HA-MAPKAP-K1 immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated for 15 min with PMA. We first wished to identify the residues in MAPKAP-K1a that were phosphorylated under basal conditions where MAPKAP-K1a was inactive.32P-Labeled COS-1 cells were therefore treated for 3 h with PD 98059 in the absence of PMA (Fig. 1), and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that, under these conditions, inactive MAPKAP-K1a was phosphorylated only at serine residues. Following tryptic digestion and chromatography on a C18 column, two major32P-labeled peptides were recovered (termed T1 and T2) that eluted at 18.5 and 24% acetonitrile, respectively (Fig.2 A). Both peptides were phosphorylated at serine, and a single burst of 32P radioactivity was observed after the fourth (peptide T1) and third (peptide T2) cycles of Edman degradation (data not shown). Further experiments described below established that peptides T1 and T2 corresponded to residues 730–736 and 220–237, respectively, and that in unstimulated cells treated with PD 98059, MAPKAP-K1a was phosphorylated at Ser222 in the “activation loop” of the NTD and at Ser733 four residues from the extreme C terminus. To identify the residues that became phosphorylated when MAPKAP-K1a was activated, the experiments described above were repeated after stimulation of the COS-1 cells with PMA. Stimulation with PMA was accompanied by a 5–6-fold increase (three experiments) in the 32P labeling of MAPKAP-K1a with respect to cells incubated with PD 98059 in the absence of PMA (Fig.2 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that threonine residues became phosphorylated upon cell stimulation with PMA, although the majority of the phosphate was still present as phosphoserine (data not shown). Tryptic digestion and C18 chromatography revealed that stimulation with PMA not only caused a 2–3-fold increase in the phosphorylation of peptides T1 and T2 (three experiments), but also induced the 32P labeling of two new major peptides termed T4 (21.8% acetonitrile) and T5 (27.7% acetonitrile) along with several minor peptides termed T3 (13% acetonitrile), T6 (28.8% acetonitrile), and T7 (30% acetonitrile) (Fig. 2 C). Peptides T1, T2, and T5 were purified (see “Experimental Procedures”) and sequenced. Peptide T1 corresponded to residues 730–736, with the phosphorylation site being Ser733 (Fig.3 A), whereas peptide T2 corresponded to residues 220–237, with the phosphorylation site being Ser222 (Fig. 3 B). Amino acid sequencing suggested that peptide T5 corresponded to residues 379–393. This phosphoserine-containing peptide (data not shown) was phosphorylated at the third residue (Fig. 3 C), corresponding to Ser381. The identity of peptide T5 was confirmed by its comigration during C18 chromatography and isoelectric focusing with an authentic phosphopeptide-(379–393) that was generated by phosphorylating bacterially expressed MAPKAP-K1a at Ser381 with MAPKAP-K2, followed by tryptic digestion (see “Experimental Procedures”). Peptide T4 was also a phosphoserine-containing peptide, and a single burst of 32P radioactivity occurred after the second cycle of Edman degradation (Fig. 3 D). There are three serine residues in human MAPKAP-K1a that occur two residues after trypsin-sensitive peptide bonds, namely Ser154, Ser364, and Ser631. The predicted tryptic phosphopeptides containing Ser154 (LSK) and Ser631 (IGSSK) would elute from C18 columns at much lower acetonitrile concentrations than peptide T4. In addition, peptide T4 comigrated during C18 chromatography and isoelectric focusing with a synthetic phosphopeptide comprising residues 363–377 and phosphorylated at Ser364. These results, and further experiments described below, established that Ser364 was phosphorylated in vivo in response to PMA. Peptide T7 was a phosphothreonine-containing peptide, and a single burst of radioactivity occurred after eight cycles of Edman degradation (Fig. 3 E). The only threonine residues in MAPKAP-K1 located eight residues after an Arg or Lys residue are Thr574 and Thr519. Thr574 is located at the position equivalent to a Thr residue in rabbit MAPKAP-K1b phosphorylated by p42 MAPK in vitro (17Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further evidence presented below indicates that this residue is indeed the site of phosphorylation. The minor phosphoserine-containing peptide T3 and the minor phosphothreonine-containing peptide T6 could not be purified in sufficient amounts for the sites of phosphorylation to be identified. Peptide T6 may contain Thr360 since evidence presented below demonstrates that this residue is phosphorylated in vivo. However, peptide T6 was not present in all tryptic digests (cf. Fig. 8). The smallest tryptic peptide containing Thr360 would be expected to comprise residues 334–362. Because of its size and hydrophobicity, this peptide may be insoluble and hence not recovered from the C18 column. To obtain further evidence that the assignment of phosphorylation sites was correct,32P-labeled HA-MAPKAP-K1a from 32P-labeled COS-1 cells was digested with chymotrypsin and chromatographed on a C18 column. Two prominent 32P-labeled peptides termed C1 (17.9% acetonitrile) and C2 (18.5% acetonitrile) were isolated from cells incubated with PD 98059 in the absence of PMA (Fig.4 A). Peptide C1 contained phosphoserine, and 32P radioactivity was released after the first cycle of Edman degradation (data not shown). This is consistent with peptide C1 containing Ser222 and resulting from chymotryptic cleavage at Tyr221. Peptide C2 also contained phosphoserine, and 32P radioactivity was released after the fourth cycle of Edman degradation (data not shown). Moreover, peptide C2 coeluted with tryptic peptide T1 (Fig. 2 C). These observations indicated that peptide C2 was phosphorylated at Ser733 and that it was generated by a pseudotryptic cleavage between Arg729 and Lys730. The 32P labeling of peptides C1 and C2 was increased 2–3-fold when cells were stimulated with PMA in the absence of PD 98059, as expected from the results presented in Fig. 2. In addition, several new chymotryptic phosphopeptides were generated. Peptides C3 (13.5% acetonitrile) and C4 (14.2% acetonitrile) both contained phosphothreonine as well as phosphoserine, and in both cases,32P radioactivity was released after"

Using limited proteolysis and deletion analysis, two functionally distinct domains have been mapped in cPLA2: an N-terminal domain responsible for Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding known as a CaLB or a C2 domain and a C-terminal, Ca2+-independent catalytic domain capable of hydrolyzing monomeric substrates but unable to associate with membranes (16Nalefski E.A.

In this paper, we describe the crystal structure and calcium binding characteristics of the N-terminal domain of cPLA2 that is responsible for Ca2+-dependent translocation and membrane binding of the enzyme. The structure accounts for the observed preference of cPLA2 for phospholipids with hydrophobic features such as phosphatidylcholine and explains previous observations suggesting the importance of the hydrophobic forces involved in binding of the cPLA2 C2 domain to phospholipid membranes (15Wijkander J.

Implications for the relative contributions of the hydrophobic/electrostatic interactions in the membrane binding of the C2 domains from other well characterized proteins are also presented. DNA fragments encoding residues 1–137, 1–141, or 17–141 of human cPLA2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a plasmid containing the gene for the intact enzyme that was generously provided by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK. The BglII site was incorporated at the 5′ end of the coding sequence and an EcoRI site followed by a stop codon was incorporated at the 3′ end to enable cloning intoBamHI and EcoRI-cut vector mini-pRSETA. This vector is a version of pRSETA (Invitrogen) modified so to encode a 17-residue N-terminal tail (MRGSHHHHHHGLVPRGS) containing a His6 tag for affinity purification and a thrombin cleavage site rather than the original enterokinase cleavage site for the tag removal. 2M. Proctor and M. Bycroft, unpublished data. The expressed proteins after thrombin cleavage retain at their N terminus two additional amino acids (Gly-Ser) encoded by the vector. In addition to this deviation from the native sequence, constructs 1–141 and 17–141 have two substitutions at their C terminus, C139A and C141S, that were introduced to eliminate possible complications that could be caused by cysteine residues during the refolding procedure (see below). For the purpose of heavy atom derivatives, a construct was made with a substitution of only one of these cysteines (C141S) while preserving the other cysteine (Cys-139). The proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BLR(DE3) (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C, induced at an A 600 ∼ 0.5 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 12 h, and harvested by centrifugation. The insoluble fraction containing the fusion protein was isolated from 0.5 liters of cells by sonication and centrifugation. The pellets were solubilized in 8m urea, Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, for 2 h at room temperature and centrifuged to remove the insoluble debris, and the denatured fusion protein was bound to 10 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing the column with several column volumes of 8 m urea-Tris buffer, the protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in the 8 m urea-Tris buffer, concentrated with Centriprep 10 to 1 ml, and renatured by slow dilution into a rapidly stirred solution of 1.5 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The solution was left at room temperature for 1 h and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein was concentrated using a Centriprep 10 and passed through a gel filtration Superdex 75 16/60 column (Pharmacia), equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The peak of the monomeric, refolded protein was cleaved with ∼50 units of thrombin/milligram of protein at 4 °C to remove the tag. The sample was further purified by chromatography on a MonoQ 10/10 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a gradient of sodium chloride. Protein was concentrated to ∼18 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. The crystals were grown at 21 °C in hanging drops by the vapor diffusion method. Protein (5–10 mg/ml) was first incubated with 5 mm calcium chloride for at least 30 min and then mixed with an equal volume of a precipitant containing 1m sodium acetate, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 50 mm CdSO4. Crystals appeared after 1 week and slowly grew over 3 weeks to about 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.5 mm. Crystals had P3121 symmetry with a = 79.41 and c = 70.67. For data collection, crystals were flash-frozen in nylon loops using a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. For the freezing, crystals were briefly transferred to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 66 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 660 mm sodium acetate, 33 mm CdSO4, and 25% (v/v) glycerol. Table I summarizes the data sets collected. Each data set was collected from a single crystal and processed using the program MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). The protein with a double cysteine substitution (C139A,C141S) was used for all the data sets except for the K2PtCl4 (I) derivative data set for which a protein with a single cysteine substitution (C141S) was used. For the heavy atom derivatives, crystals were soaked for 20 h in the reservoir solution containing 1 mmK2PtCl4 (data set K2PtCl4 (I)) for 5 h in 5 mm K2PtCl4 (data set K2PtCl4 (II)) or for 4 h in 10 mmLaCl3. Crystals were also grown in the presence of 10 mml-α-glycerophosphocholine orl-α-glycerophosphoserine, but no density corresponding to these compounds was observed.Table IStatistics for crystallographic data collection and phase refinementData setX-ray sourceWavelengthd minMeasurementsUnique reflectionsCompletenessR merge1-aR merge = ∑hkl∑i‖Ii(hkl) − 〈I(hkl)〉‖/∑hkl∑i Ii(hkl).ÅÅ%%Native (1)BW7B0.882.4522661179899.78.6Native (2)SRS 7.21.4882.734681712899.08.0K2PtCl4 (1)SRS 9.60.883.87690469788.815.8K2PtCl4 (2)SRS 9.60.883.114964488997.28.4LaCl3BW7B0.882.543754914299.57.4Multiple isomorphous replacement phase determinationData set1-bAll of the data sets contain the CaCl2 and CdSO4 that were present in the crystallization setup.

Open table in a new tab Most crystallographic calculations were carried out using the Collaborative Computing Project Number 4 (CCP4) program suite (27Collaborative Computing Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement using either PLC-δ1-C2 (2ISD) or SytIA-C2 (1RSY) located a single molecule in the asymmetric unit; however, several loops were impossible to trace, and extensive efforts to build and refine a model using the molecular replacement phases proved unsuccessful. Consequently, several heavy atom derivative data sets were collected. One platinum site was located by a Patterson map search using the program SHELX (28Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19198) Google Scholar). Other sites for other derivatives were located by difference Fourier analysis. Using the platinum and lanthanum derivative-phased multiple isomorphous replacement map, two strong peaks were located at the same position for all data sets. These sites were interpreted as cadmium sites. The program SHARP (29de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) was used to refine all heavy atom parameters using both anomalous and isomorphous differences. The MIRAS map showed only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Following solvent flattening with the program SOLOMON (30Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) using a solvent content of 76%, the electron density was easily interpretable, and a model was built using the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and refined with the program REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) using all data between 15 Å and 2.4 Å (9,339 reflections). The final conventional R-factor was 22.8% with a free R-factor of 27.2% (based on 1,003 random reflections in thin shells of resolution) for a model consisting of 1,001 protein atoms, 151 waters, two calcium ions, and two cadmiums. The average B-factor was 28 Å2. The r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometry were 0.007 Å and 1.8° for bond lengths and bond angles. According to analysis by PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 86% of residues are in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot, and none are in disallowed areas. The overall average G-factor from PROCHECK was −0.08. In the final SIGMAA-weighted 2 m‖F0‖-D‖FC‖ electron density map (34Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Soc. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), there is no break in the main chain density contoured at 1.2ς. The model showed that the molecular replacement solution had correctly placed the β-sheets, but some loop conformations, particularly calcium binding region 1 (CBR1) and strand β7, were greatly different than those in either PLCδ-C2 or SytI-C2A. In addition, the structure showed a shift in the sequence alignment for the last two β strands relative to the alignment that was expected on the basis of sequence analysis (35Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The platinum derivatives each had a single site corresponding to an interaction with the side chain of Met-98. The two cadmium sites each have ligands from two adjacent molecules in the crystal and appear to be essential for crystal packing. The refined B-factors of the calcium ions were considerably lower than their surrounding protein ligands, suggesting partial occupancy of these sites by more electron-dense cadmium. This was confirmed by collecting a 2.5-Å resolution data set in which crystals were soaked in a solution with a much greater concentration of calcium (40 mm) and a lower concentration of cadmium (10 mm). For this data set, the B-factors of the calcium were approximately the same as their protein ligands. The coordinates and structure factor amplitudes will be deposited with the Protein Data Bank and can be obtained immediately via E-mail to the author. To pursue structural studies of the isolated cPLA2 C2 domain, we made several constructs with slightly different boundaries for the expression inE. coli. Two topologies for C2 domains have been described: one present in the first C2 domain of synaptotagmin I (SytI-C2A) (36Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) (S variant or topology I) and another present in the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLCδ-C2) (37Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) (P variant or topology II) (35Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 38Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The two topologies can be best described as circular permutations of each other. PLC-δ1 starts with a strand corresponding to the β2 strand of (SytI-C2A) and ends with a strand corresponding to the β1 strand of SytI-C2A. Choosing wrong boundaries for the isolated domain could greatly destabilize the protein by truncating either the N-terminal or the C-terminal strand. Three constructs were expressed that would cover either the S variant (amino acids 1–137) or the P variant (amino acids 17–141) or both topologies (amino acids 1–141). When expressed in E. coli, all three constructs were insoluble and had to be refolded from inclusion bodies. Among the three constructs, 17–141 was the most stable (determined from temperature denaturation monitored by circular dichroism and equilibrium urea denaturation monitored by fluorescence 3S. Fong and M. Bycroft, unpublished data. ) and was the only one that yielded crystals in the crystallization trials. The overall fold of the cPLA2 C2 domain is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. As with the C2 domain from PLC-δ1 (PLCδ-C2) and the C2A domain from Syt I (SytI-C2A), it consists of an anti-parallel β-sandwich with two 4-stranded sheets. Sheet I of the β-sandwich consisting of strands 3, 2, 5, and 6 and has a concave surface to it, whereas sheet II has a convex appearance. The topology of the domain is identical to that of PLCδ-C2 and is a circular permutation of the SytI-C2A topology (Fig.2). Recently, this topology was predicted for the cPLA2 C2 domain based on the sequence analysis of 65 C2 domains and the known structure for the two topological variants (35Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Although naturally occurring circular permutations have been noted previously for other proteins (39Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the C2 domains have strikingly conserved three-dimensional structures despite the topological variations. A structurally conserved core of 105 residues of the C2 domain of cPLA2 can be superimposed on those of PLC-δ1-C2 and SytI-C2A with 1.3 and 1.4 Å r.m.s. deviation, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the residues that superimpose well among the three C2 domains are two of the connecting loops (CBR2 and CBR3) and all of the β-strands except the edge strand 7 of sheet II. Two loops involved in calcium binding, CBR2 and CBR3, have main-chain conformations that are essentially identical to the conformations observed for PLCδ-C2 and for SytIA-C2. The third loop involved in calcium binding, CBR1, is longer than in either PLC-δ1 or SytI-C2A and has a turn of α-helix. Among the three C2 domain structures, CBR1 has the most variable loop conformation. From sequence analysis of C2 domains, it is clear that this region has the greatest variability in both length and character (35Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 40Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The curved shape of the domain is caused by four β-bulges that represent a conserved feature of the cPLA2, SytI-C2A, and PLCδ-C2 domains.Figure 2A comparison of the three structurally characterized C2 domains. A, a sequence alignment for the C2 domains of cPLA2 (human), PLC-δ1 (rat), and SytI-C2A (rat). The secondary structure elements of cPLA2 are indicatedabove the sequence. Because the topology of SytI-C2A is a circular permutation of cPLA2 and PLC-δ1, the numbering for structurally equivalent strands is different. The boxedsequences represent regions that can be structurally superimposed. Residues in gray-shaded areas bind calcium or calcium analogues, and the calcium binding sites (I, II, or III) to which the residues contribute are indicated below the sequence.B, a schematic of the three C2 domain crystal structures with bound metals. One consequence of the differences in topology is that the N and C termini are on opposite ends of the domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The C2 domain of cPLA2 was co-crystallized with calcium, and the structure reveals that it binds two Ca2+ ions at one end of the domain between three loops, previously named CBRs: CBR1, CBR2, and CBR3 (Fig. 1 B, Fig.2) (38Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As with PLCδ-C2, the two calcium sites are adjacent and about 4 Å apart. Calcium site I has a coordination that is approximately a pentagonal bipyramid with one of the equatorial positions missing where the two sites adjoin each other. The coordination at site II is best described as an octahedron with one of the equatorial vertices represented by a bidentate interaction with Asp-93. Calcium site I has six ligands with an average distance to the calcium of 2.5 Å and consists of one side-chain oxygen from each of Asp-40, Asp-43, Asn-65, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr-41, and two water molecules (Fig. 1, Fig. 3). The seven ligands for site II have an average distance to the calcium of 2.5 Å and consist of one side-chain oxygen from each of Asp-40, Asp-43, and Asn-95, both side-chain oxygens of Asp-93, the carbonyl oxygen of Ala-94, and one water molecule. The exposed apices of each calcium site are occupied by waters (Fig. 1 C). These waters would presumably be displaced so that the calcium ions could form a direct interaction with the phosphate moiety of a lipid headgroup. Two of the residues ligating the Ca2+ ions, Asp-40 and Asp-43, form one interaction with each Ca2+ ion. This arrangement of Ca2+ binding sites would be expected to lead to cooperative Ca2+ binding because the binding of one ion would position the ligands of the second ion as well as neutralize the negative charge in the binding site, allowing the acidic side chains for the second site to more closely approach each other. Taken together, the structural studies of C2 domains suggest three possible Ca2+ binding sites, I, II, and III (Fig. 3). SytI-C2A shows Ca2+ binding in sites II and III (41Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and PLCδ-C2 binding in sites I and II (and in all three sites with lanthanum) (38Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 42Grobler J.A. Essen L.-O. Williams R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The two sites in cPLA2 correspond to sites I and II. The structural arrangement of these multiple sites explains the cooperativity of calcium binding that has been observed. A Hill coefficient of 3 has been reported for the isolated SytI-C2A domain (43Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Doc2β C2A domain (44Kojima T. Fukuda M. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the SytII-C2A domain, (45Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and for the C2 domain from PKC-β (41Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Half-maximal binding of these domains to phosphatidylcholine /phosphatidylserine lyposomes occurs at very similar, 1–5 μm, free calcium concentrations. In the absence of phospholipids, the affinity for calcium is much lower, and dissociation constants of 60 μm (site II) and 400 μm (site III) for calcium binding to the SytIA domain have been reported (41Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The lack of calcium binding at site III in the cPLA2 C2 domain is likely due to the conservative substitution D95N in comparison with the analogous CBR3 residue of SytI-C2A (Asp-232) and PLC-δ1 (Asp-708). This would further decrease the already low affinity in Site III (400 μm) as measured for SytI-C2A. The equivalent mutation in SytI-C2A (D232N) abolishes calcium-depe"

A collagen-coated magnetic bead model was used to apply forces directly to the actin cytoskeleton through integrin receptors. We demonstrate here that by a calcium-dependent mechanism, human fibroblasts reinforce locally their connection with extracellular adhesion sites by inducing actin assembly and by recruiting actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280) into cortical adhesion complexes. ABP-280 was phosphorylated on serine residues as a result of force application. This phosphorylation and the force-induced actin reorganization were largely abrogated by inhibitors of protein kinase C. In a human melanoma cell line that does not express ABP-280, actin accumulation could not be induced by force, whereas in stable transfectants expressing ABP-280, force-induced actin accumulation was similar to human fibroblasts. Cortical actin assembly played a role in regulating the activity of stretch-activated, calcium-permeable channels (SAC) since sustained force application desensitized SAC to subsequent force applications, and the decrease in stretch sensitivity was reversed after treatment with cytochalasin D. ABP-280-deficient cells showed a >90% increase in cell death compared with ABP-280+ve cells after force application. We conclude that ABP-280 plays an important role in mechanoprotection by reinforcing the membrane cortex and desensitizing SACs.

We conclude that ABP-280 plays an important role in mechanoprotection by reinforcing the membrane cortex and desensitizing SACs. A large body of recent work has focused on how cells convert applied mechanical tension into cytoplasmic signals that regulate cell metabolism and transcription (mechanotransduction) (1Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 2Arora P.D. Bibby K.J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Important elements of mechanotransduction include cellular adaptation and survival in the face of increased environmental force (4McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Indeed, cells undergo dramatic internal structural changes in response to increased environmental forces (5Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mechanoprotective, structural adaptations enable cells to maintain membrane integrity, cell shape, and adhesion to extracellular matrix molecules (4McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, periodontal ligament fibroblasts function in a much more mechanically stressed environment than gingival fibroblasts and have a nearly 2-fold higher proportion of actin in filamentous form (7Pender N.A.M. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This example indicates that cells are able to sense and adapt to environmental tension in part through cytoskeletal adaptations. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts up-regulate their attachment strength to extracellular matrix ligands if increased tension is applied through integrins (8Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), indicating that cells not only sense changes in applied extracellular loads but can rapidly reinforce cytoskeletal linkages locally at force application sites. Consistent with these data we have demonstrated that fibroblasts undergo localized actin assembly during isolated force application through focal adhesion complexes (6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Localized cortical actin mechanoprotective responses presumably involve actin-binding proteins. The cross-linking and bundling activities of actin-binding proteins can increase the structural strength and integrity of the cortical actin network (9Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Among the most efficient actin cross-linking proteins is actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280), 1The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; SAC, stretch-activated, calcium-permeable channels; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-(bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PKC, protein kinase C. 1The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; SAC, stretch-activated, calcium-permeable channels; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-(bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PKC, protein kinase C. a 540-kDa dimeric protein first identified in macrophages (10Stossel T.P. Hastwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and present in other tissues including most non-muscle cells (11Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A homologous protein, filamin, first purified from skeletal muscle (12Shizuta Y. Shizuta H. Gallo M. Davies P. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6562-6567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gotlieb A.I. Heggeness M.H. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 100: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) shares extensive sequence homology with ABP-280 but is encoded by a separate gene and displays different abilities to cross-link or bundle F-actin. ABP-280, filamin, dystrophin, spectrin, α-actinin, ABP-120, and fimbrin are part of an actin cross-linking superfamily (14Byers T.J. Beggs A.H. McNally E.M. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that share a common actin-binding site (11Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Some members of this superfamily (spectrin and dystrophin) may act to mechanically reinforce the cell membrane (15McNeil P.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and thereby enhance membrane stability during increased membrane tension. Notably, ABP-280 cross-links actin and links actin to integral membrane proteins (16Okita J.R. Pidard D. Newman P.J. Montgomery R.R. Kunicki T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar), thereby providing increased cellular cortical rigidity (18Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thus ABP-280 and other actin cross-linking and bundling proteins may be key structural elements that stabilize the cell membrane by facilitating interactions between the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane.The importance of structural interactions between the cortical cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane in ion channel regulation has been recognized previously (3Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sokabe M. Sachs F. Jing Z.Q. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 722-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20Sachs F. Crit. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 1988; 16: 141-169PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, ABP-280 has been implicated in regulating the conductance of ion channels activated by cell swelling (21Cantiello H.F. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 970-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since chronically high Ca2+ entry is known to be toxic to cells (22Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), it is likely that cells in mechanically active environments must have evolved adaptive mechanisms to regulate the sensitivity of SACs to chronic or prolonged high membrane tension. We have suggested previously that the open probability of SACs is dependent on the rigidity of the membrane cortex which is determined by specific cytoskeletal proteins and their organization (6Glogauer M.

In this study we have characterized a localized, force-induced actin recruitment to focal adhesions and have examined the dependence of this recruitment on ABP-280. In this article, we test the hypothesis that ABP-280 mediates a mechanoprotective mechanism that desensitizes SACs and is important for cell survival in the face of applied physical stress.DISCUSSIONThe important question of how cells protect themselves and adapt to increased environmental tension remains largely unanswered. By using a novel force application model (6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we studied actin recruitment to focal-like contacts through which the tension was applied. Our principal finding is that force induces a local actin accumulation at force transfer sites that is dependent on the co-localization and modification of ABP-280. Previous studies have focused on whole cell cytoskeletal changes during force application (5Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These types of studies do not provide information on local changes in the cell cortex that may be important for signal transduction and cellular mechanoprotective processes. We have used a magnetic bead model that allowed the application of defined, localized forces directly through integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeletal complex. This method also permits isolation of proteins that localize to these force transfer sites and thereby facilitates analyses of local changes during increased membrane and cytoskeletal tension. By using atomic force microscopy, we have previously demonstrated that this model induces localized changes in actin assembly that result in increased local rigidity. The localized changes in actin assembly occurred without causing detectable changes in global actin architecture or the global cellular balance of actin monomer/filament (6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Role of ABP-280The force-induced actin accumulation was not a result of increased integrin clustering or increased number of focal contacts since vinculin and α2-integrin levels in Western blot analyses of bead-derived proteins were unchanged after force application. Consequently we endeavored to determine if any actin-binding proteins were components of the local force-induced assembly and accumulation. Examination of a group of actin-binding proteins that have been previously associated with regulating actin form and architecture showed that of the proteins examined, only ABP-280 was enriched at the force application sites. The importance of this ABP-280 enrichment in mediating actin accumulation was demonstrated in a human melanoma cell line that does not express ABP-280. These cells did not accumulate actin after application of force; however, when ABP-280 was expressed in these same cells, the localized mechanoprotective actin response was restored. The ABP-280 accumulation explains in part the localized increase in membrane rigidity following force application. ABP-280 has been shown to increase the rigidity of actin solutions in vitro (39Brotschi E.A. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8988-8993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells expressing ABP-280 have more than a 2-fold greater elastic modulus (cortical rigidity) compared with corresponding ABP-280-deficient cells (18Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar).The requirement of ABP-280 for the force-induced actin accumulation implicates ABP-280 as an important mechanoprotective protein. The mechanism by which ABP-280 could locally increase actin accumulation involves at least three possible routes. First, as ABP-280 can increase actin polymerization/gelation rates in vitro (40Nunnally M.H. Powell L.D. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2083-2086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that localized increases of ABP-280 mediate an accumulation of F-actin. Second, ABP-280 is associated with F-actin binding to integral membrane proteins (41Kovacsovics T.J. Hartwig J.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 618-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filamin has been localized to the membrane-associated ends of stress fibers in chicken fibroblasts (42Pavalko F.M. Otey C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 109-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ABP-280 may interact directly with integrins (17Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar). Thus ABP-280 may increase the number of F-actin connections with the plasma membrane and thereby increase the number of membrane-bound polymerization sites. Third, since ABP-280 is a potent actin filament cross-linking protein (11Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), ABP-280 may simply increase the local F-actin content by cross-linking or attaching smaller filaments into an enlarged, local cortical complex.ABP-280 RegulationWe demonstrated that the force-induced cytoskeletal response is dependent on calcium ions and actin polymerization since both chelation of free cytoplasmic calcium ions and cytochalasin D treatment inhibited the accumulations of both ABP-280 and actin. However, since ABP-280 was required for actin accumulation, we sought to determine what specific regulatory pathway was involved in the force response. As ABP-280 is a phosphoprotein with more than 380 serine/threonine residues (11Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylation may be an important regulatory process for localized accumulation in the bead complex (37Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6745-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The data showed that ABP-280 was phosphorylated on serine residues following force application. From the amino acid sequence of ABP-280, 33 potential PKC sites have been deduced (11Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and this suggested that ABP-280 may be phosphorylated by PKC. Indeed 10 of the 33 PKC phosphorylation sites are clustered near the N terminus which contains the actin-binding domain (36Wu M.P. Jay D. Stracher A. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). This observation supports the idea that PKC may be involved in regulating the ability of ABP-280 to bind actin. We found that BIM and calphostin C, potent inhibitors of PKC, reduced the serine phosphorylation induced by force and also reduced the amount of ABP-280 localizing to the bead/force application site. This finding suggests that serine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating ABP-280 force-induced actin binding and that PKC is one of the kinases involved in this event. Support for this regulatory mechanism comes from Wu and co-workers (36Wu M.P. Jay D. Stracher A. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated the existence of four phosphorylated forms of ABP-280 in platelets and showed that the more phosphorylated form is able to cross-link twice as much actin as the lesser phosphorylated forms.SACMechanoprotective responses likely involve regulation of stretch-activated ion channels (SAC) since chronic force application without SAC desensitization could lead to pathologically high calcium levels (22Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). As we have previously demonstrated (3Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the actin cytoskeleton does play a regulatory role in SAC activation. In the present report, cells with localized cytoskeletal accumulation exhibited decreased SAC activity, an effect that was reversed by cytochalasin D. To determine if ABP-280 plays a role in regulating SAC sensitivity, we studied the stretch-induced calcium influx in ABP-280-deficient cells. There was a markedly increased calcium influx in the ABP-280-deficient cells compared with the ABP-280+ cells suggesting that ABP-280 reduces the open probability of SACs possibly through a tension absorption mechanism. Previous work with the same ABP-280-deficient cell line demonstrated increased basal permeability to K+ ions and the lack of a regulatory volume decrease in response to osmotically induced stretch. These alterations were thought to be caused by deficient linkages between the actin cortex and the membrane (43Cantiello H.F. Prat A.G. Bonventre J.V. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Ausiello D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4596-4599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis we suggest that ABP-280 and actin interactions are part of a sensing mechanism required to regulate ion transport at the plasma membrane.Membrane StabilizationApplied force apparently shifts the actin monomer/filament equilibrium in cortical regions toward gelation which in turn promotes the formation of a protective shell. The protective nature of this response is suggested by the observation that compared with ABP-280+ cells, ABP-280-deficient cells demonstrated significant elevations of propidium iodide staining after increasing membrane tension indicative of plasma membrane disruption. The increased gelation in the cortical region also affects downstream actin-dependent events such as motility and phagocytosis. In an in vitro motility model, increased gelation due to higher levels of ABP-280 is associated with inhibition of filament velocity and reductions in the number of moving filaments (44Janson L.W. Sellers J.R. Taylor D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ABP-280-induced gelation of the actin cytoskeleton also dramatically inhibits the rate of gel contraction (45Janson L.W. Kolega J. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on this previously mentioned work and our data, we suggest that the force-induced cross-linking of cortical actin filaments decreases actin filament turnover which is required for rapid ruffling and pseudopod extension (46Schindl M. Wallraff E. Deubzer B. Witke W. Gerisch G. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1177-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The main finding in this report is that ABP-280 is recruited into cortical areas under increased tension, and in bead-associated sites ABP-280 promotes actin gelation and membrane stabilization. ABP-280-dependent actin accumulations may influence membrane deformability by the applied force, thereby dampening deformation-based signaling and SAC activity. We conclude that ABP-280 plays an important role in cellular adaptation during increased environmental tension by structurally protecting the cell and by helping to modulate and regulate mechanotransduction signals. A large body of recent work has focused on how cells convert applied mechanical tension into cytoplasmic signals that regulate cell metabolism and transcription (mechanotransduction) (1Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 2Arora P.D. Bibby K.J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Important elements of mechanotransduction include cellular adaptation and survival in the face of increased environmental force (4McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Indeed, cells undergo dramatic internal structural changes in response to increased environmental forces (5Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mechanoprotective, structural adaptations enable cells to maintain membrane integrity, cell shape, and adhesion to extracellular matrix molecules (4McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, periodontal ligament fibroblasts function in a much more mechanically stressed environment than gingival fibroblasts and have a nearly 2-fold higher proportion of actin in filamentous form (7Pender N.A.M. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This example indicates that cells are able to sense and adapt to environmental tension in part through cytoskeletal adaptations. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts up-regulate their attachment strength to extracellular matrix ligands if increased tension is applied through integrins (8Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), indicating that cells not only sense changes in applied extracellular loads but can rapidly reinforce cytoskeletal linkages locally at force application sites. Consistent with these data we have demonstrated that fibroblasts undergo localized actin assembly during isolated force application through focal adhesion complexes (6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Localized cortical actin mechanoprotective responses presumably involve actin-binding proteins. The cross-linking and bundling activities of actin-binding proteins can increase the structural strength and integrity of the cortical actin network (9Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Among the most efficient actin cross-linking proteins is actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280), 1The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; SAC, stretch-activated, calcium-permeable channels; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-(bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PKC, protein kinase C. 1The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; SAC, stretch-activated, calcium-permeable channels; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-(bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PKC, protein kinase C. a 540-kDa dimeric protein first identified in macrophages (10Stossel T.P. Hastwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and present in other tissues including most non-muscle cells (11Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A homologous protein, filamin, first purified from skeletal muscle (12Shizuta Y. Shizuta H. Gallo M. Davies P. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6562-6567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gotlieb A.I. Heggeness M.H. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 100: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) shares extensive sequence homology with ABP-280 but is encoded by a separate gene and displays different abilities to cross-link or bundle F-actin. ABP-280, filamin, dystrophin, spectrin, α-actinin, ABP-120, and fimbrin are part of an actin cross-linking superfamily (14Byers T.J. Beggs A.H. McNally E.M. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that share a common actin-binding site (11Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Some members of this superfamily (spectrin and dystrophin) may act to mechanically reinforce the cell membrane (15McNeil P.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and thereby enhance membrane stability during increased membrane tension. Notably, ABP-280 cross-links actin and links actin to integral membrane proteins (16Okita J.R. Pidard D. Newman P.J. Montgomery R.R. Kunicki T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar), thereby providing increased cellular cortical rigidity (18Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thus ABP-280 and other actin cross-linking and bundling proteins may be key structural elements that stabilize the cell membrane by facilitating interactions between the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. The importance of structural interactions between the cortical cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane in ion channel regulation has been recognized previously (3Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sokabe M. Sachs F. Jing Z.Q. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 722-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20Sachs F. Crit. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 1988; 16: 141-169PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, ABP-280 has been implicated in regulating the conductance of ion channels activated by cell swelling (21Cantiello H.F. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 970-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since chronically high Ca2+ entry is known to be toxic to cells (22Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), it is likely that cells in mechanically active environments must have evolved adaptive mechanisms to regulate the sensitivity of SACs to chronic or prolonged high membrane tension. We have suggested previously that the open probability of SACs is dependent on the rigidity of the membrane cortex which is determined by specific cytoskeletal proteins and their organization (6Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized a localized, force-induced actin recruitment to focal adhesions and have examined the dependence of this recruitment on ABP-280. In this article, we test the hypothesis that ABP-280 mediates a mechanoprotective mechanism that desensitizes SACs and is important for cell survival in the face of applied physical stress.

The 3-O-acetyl derivatives of these toxins were shown to reduce their in vitro activity significantly as assessed by assays using a rabbit reticulocyte translation system. The results suggested that the introduction of an O-acetyl group at the C-3 position in the biosynthetic pathway works as a resistance mechanism forFusarium species that produce t-type trichothecenes (trichothecenes synthesized via the precursor trichotriol).A gene responsible for the 3-O-acetylation reaction,Tri101, has been successfully cloned from a Fusarium graminearum cDNA library that was designed to be expressed inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast transformants were selected for their ability to grow in the presence of T-2 toxin, and this strategy allowed isolation of 25 resistant clones, all of which contained a cDNA for Tri101.

Trichothecenes belong to a family of sesquiterpenoid secondary metabolites produced by Fusarium species and other molds (1Vesonder R.F. Golinski P. Chelkowski J. Fusarium Mycotoxins, Taxonomy, and Pathogenicity. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1989: 1-39Google Scholar). Considerable variation exists in the oxygenation pattern of individual trichothecenes, but all are characterized by a 9,10 double bond and a 12,13 epoxide group. These compounds are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis in eukaryotes (2Ueno Y. Nakajima M. Sakai K. Ishii K. Sato N. Shimada N. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar) and prevent polypeptide chain initiation or elongation by binding to 60 S ribosomal subunits (3Ehrlich K.C. Daigle K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). From pharmacological and toxicological points of view, trichothecenes are an important group of mycotoxins that cause serious problems of food pollution. They have been implicated in incidents of mycotoxicosis such as vomiting, dermatitis, and hemorrhagic septicemia in humans and livestock (4Desjardins A.E. Hohn T.M. McCormick S.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 595-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The trichothecene biosynthetic pathway has been studied in detail by the use of blocked mutants and by precursor feeding experiments. The proposed pathway in Fusarium species (see Fig. 1) proceeds from mevalonate via farnesyl pyrophosphate, trichodiene (5Blackwell B.A. Miller J.D. Greenhalgh R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4243-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isotrichodiol (tricho-9-ene-2α,11α-diol) (6Hesketh A.R. Gledhill L. Marsh D.C. Bycroft B.W. Dewick P.M. Gilbert J. J. Chem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to produce a group of t-type trichothecenes (trichothecenes synthesized via the precursor trichotriol; see “Discussion”). Although the pathway intermediates and the sequence of the reactions were well characterized, recent investigation has revealed an unexpected result; i.e. the radiolabeled 3-O-acetyl group of isotrichodermin was mostly lost in its metabolism to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (11Zamir L.O. Nikolakakis A. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the fate of the 3-O-acetyl group in the pathway still remains an open question for further study.The structure-activity relationships of trichothecenes were investigated, and the stereospecific nature of their action has been demonstrated in a previous study (12Anderson D.W. Black R.M. Lee C.G. Pottage C. Rickard R.L. Sandford M.S. Webber T.D. Williams N.E. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the significance of substituents at the C-3 position seems to have been underestimated. Our results on in vitro toxicity, standing on the elucidated biosynthetic pathway (see Fig. 1), led to the assumption that specific O-acetylation at the C-3 position following the second cyclization reaction to give isotrichodermol must be related to a self-defense mechanism for the fungus to produce t-type trichothecenes. This assumption afforded an efficient strategy to isolate a new trichothecene biosynthetic gene,Tri101, that is responsible for the 3-O-acetylation. The present report describes cloning and analysis of Tri101 and its DNA-flanking regions, and the results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of trichothecene biosynthesis.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies classified trichothecenes into two groups according to the types of substituents at the C-8 position (2Ueno Y. Nakajima M. Sakai K. Ishii K. Sato N. Shimada N. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar) or the types of protein synthesis inhibition at 60 S ribosomal subunits (3Ehrlich K.C. Daigle K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here we propose that trichothecenes could also reasonably be divided into two types according to the structure of the pathway intermediates immediately before the second cyclization reaction, i.e.trichothecenes that are derived from di-oxygenated trichodiol and tri-oxygenated trichotriol could be referred to as d-type and t-type trichothecenes, respectively. Several pieces of circumstantial evidence suggest that 3-O-acetylation works as a self-defense mechanism for the t-type-producing fungi.Is Tri101 a Self-defense Gene for the t-type Trichothecene Producer?Although T-2 toxin was inactive on spore germination ofF. graminearum F15, trichothecin (Fig. 1), a d-type trichothecene similarly toxic as T-2 toxin to S. pombe(Table I), exerted a potent inhibitory action on the fungal germination at 100 μg/ml in YPD medium. This inhibitory action would be attributed to the lack of the 3-hydroxyl group to be acetylated in d-type trichothecenes. Other t-type trichothecenes did not inhibit spore germination of the fungus due to the presence of the 3-O-acetyltransferase activity. The result indicates that resistance in t-type-producing strains does not involve modification or replacement of the target ribosomes, as opposed to the d-type resistance mechanisms of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant (24Fried H.M. Warner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the trichothecin-producing strain of Trichothecium roseum (25Iglesias M. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Due to the commercial unavailability of the intermediates, we could not check whether S. pombe cells expressing Tri101have an ability to convert isotrichodermol to isotrichodermin. However, it seems very likely that Tri101 is the only gene responsible for the reaction, considering that all of the 25 T-2 toxin-resistant S. pombe transformants carriedTri101 and that no homologous genes were contained in the genome of the t-type-producing fungus. Furthermore, recombinant TRI101 from E. coli was specific to the C-3 hydroxyl group of the trichothecene ring irrespective of the substituents at other positions. These results suggest that all the compounds with 3-hydroxy-12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene structure served as substrates for the enzyme. Thus, the primary defensive strategy of F. graminearum would be modification of t-type trichothecenes by TRI101 through O-acetylation at the C-3 position.N-Acetylation and O-phosphorylation are representatives of self-defense mechanisms against various kinds of antibiotics. Inactivation of a drug by O-acetylation is known to occur in the case of chloramphenicol, but it was not found in organisms that produce chloramphenicol. To our knowledge,Tri101 is the first antibiotic-inactivatingO-acetyltransferase gene derived from a producing organism. The existence of an apparent 3-O-acetyl exchange mechanism in the biosynthetic pathway (11Zamir L.O. Nikolakakis A. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) may possibly be explained by the relative instability of the 3-O-acetyl group attached to the trichothecene ring and the importance of the substituent that has to be re-acetylated for the well being of the producer.Utility of Tri101The idea that the tricyclic intermediates of t-type trichothecenes are modified by Tri101 would have important implications for understanding the mechanism of trichothecene production. If the gene is essential for the self-defense mechanism, the Tri101 − mutant generated through a genetic transformation technique would be lethal when the toxic intermediates accumulated within the cell. An alternative way to rescue the lethalTri101− mutation is to introduce a second mutation on genes that catalyze a trichothecene biosynthetic step before the formation of isotrichodermol. Such oxygenation genes can be inactivated by integration of a selectable marker using the restriction enzyme-mediated integrationtechnique (26Schiestl R.H. Peters T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7585-7589Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 27Shi Z. Christian D. Leung H. Phytopathology. 1995; 85: 329-333Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This implies that use of a Tri101− mutant provides an opportunity to clone other biosynthetic genes before the second cyclization reaction by simply selecting for the ability of the restriction enzyme-mediated integration transformants to grow under conditions that permit trichothecene biosynthesis.Another possible application of the gene comes out of the observations of several researchers (28Bean G.A. Fernado T. Jarvis B.B. Burton B. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1984; 47: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Miller J.D. Arnison P.G. Can. J. Plant Pathol. 1986; 8: 147-150Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Desjardins A.E. Spencer G.F. Plattner R.D. Beremand M.N. Phytopathology. 1989; 79: 170-175Crossref Google Scholar) that trichothecenes play a role as a virulence factor in a number of plant diseases. The availability of theTri5 gene made it possible to evaluate the role of trichothecene at the molecular level (18Hohn T.M. Desjardins A.E. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1992; 5: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Desjardins A.E. Hohn T.M. McCormick S.P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1992; 5: 214-222Crossref Google Scholar), and recently theTri5 − disruptant of Gibberella zeaehas been shown to be less virulent on wheat than the trichothecene-producing parental strains (32Proctor R.H. Hohn T.M. McCormick S.P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 33Desjardins A.E. Proctor R.H. Bai G. McCormick S.P. Shancer G. Buechley G. Hohn T.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1996; 9: 775-781Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Therefore, a transgenic plant expressing Tri101 might be valuable for control of wheat head scab and reduce the use of agricultural chemicals.Location of Tri101 in the Genome of the Producer FungusThe first successful cloning of a trichothecene biosynthetic gene yieldedTri5 (formerly Tox5), encoding trichodiene synthase (34Hohn T.M. Vanmiddlesworth F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Tri5 was cloned by screening a λgt11 library of F. sporotrichioides with antiserum raised against the purified enzymes (35Hohn T.M. Beremand P.D. Gene. 1989; 79: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, other trichothecene biosynthetic genes, Tri3 (23McCormick S.P. Hohn T.M. Desjardins A.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 353-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Tri4 (17Hohn T.M. Desjardins A.E. McCormick S.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and a regulatory gene, Tri6 (19Proctor R.H. Hohn T.M. McCormick S.P. Desjardins A.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been identified in cosmid clones that cover a region of 60 kb around Tri5. Thus, it was of interest whether Tri101 was also clustered in the same region in the genome of the producer fungus. PCR analysis indicated that Tri101 was not located near these biosynthetic genes, but this does not necessarily rule out the possibility of its existence in the trichothecene biosynthetic gene cluster. Rather, theTri101-containing cosmid clones might be useful in isolating other genes, not linked to Tri5 in the biosynthetic gene cluster. In fact, transformations with the Tri5-containing cosmid clones did not result in restoration of T-2 toxin production in a strain carrying mutations at the Tri1 locus (36Hohn T.M. McCormick S.P. Desjardins A.E. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that the gene cluster is too large to be covered by several cosmid clones. Further investigation may shed light on the structure of the trichothecene biosynthetic gene cluster and the mechanism of trichothecene production. Trichothecenes belong to a family of sesquiterpenoid secondary metabolites produced by Fusarium species and other molds (1Vesonder R.F. Golinski P. Chelkowski J. Fusarium Mycotoxins, Taxonomy, and Pathogenicity. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1989: 1-39Google Scholar). Considerable variation exists in the oxygenation pattern of individual trichothecenes, but all are characterized by a 9,10 double bond and a 12,13 epoxide group. These compounds are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis in eukaryotes (2Ueno Y. Nakajima M. Sakai K. Ishii K. Sato N. Shimada N. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar) and prevent polypeptide chain initiation or elongation by binding to 60 S ribosomal subunits (3Ehrlich K.C. Daigle K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). From pharmacological and toxicological points of view, trichothecenes are an important group of mycotoxins that cause serious problems of food pollution. They have been implicated in incidents of mycotoxicosis such as vomiting, dermatitis, and hemorrhagic septicemia in humans and livestock (4Desjardins A.E. Hohn T.M. McCormick S.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 595-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trichothecene biosynthetic pathway has been studied in detail by the use of blocked mutants and by precursor feeding experiments. The proposed pathway in Fusarium species (see Fig. 1) proceeds from mevalonate via farnesyl pyrophosphate, trichodiene (5Blackwell B.A. Miller J.D. Greenhalgh R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4243-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isotrichodiol (tricho-9-ene-2α,11α-diol) (6Hesketh A.R. Gledhill L. Marsh D.C. Bycroft B.W. Dewick P.M. Gilbert J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; : 1184-1186Crossref Google Scholar), isotrichotriol (tricho-9-ene-2α,3α,11α-triol) (7McCormick S.P. Taylor S.L. Plattner R.D. Beremand M.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8McCormick S.P. Taylor S.L. Plattner R.D. Beremand M.N. Appl. Environ.

Chem. 1987; 52: 4405-4408Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), isotrichodermol (3α-hydroxytrichothecene) (8McCormick S.P. Taylor S.L. Plattner R.D. Beremand M.N. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 1990; 56: 702-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to produce a group of t-type trichothecenes (trichothecenes synthesized via the precursor trichotriol; see “Discussion”). Although the pathway intermediates and the sequence of the reactions were well characterized, recent investigation has revealed an unexpected result; i.e. the radiolabeled 3-O-acetyl group of isotrichodermin was mostly lost in its metabolism to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (11Zamir L.O. Nikolakakis A. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the fate of the 3-O-acetyl group in the pathway still remains an open question for further study. The structure-activity relationships of trichothecenes were investigated, and the stereospecific nature of their action has been demonstrated in a previous study (12Anderson D.W. Black R.M. Lee C.G. Pottage C. Rickard R.L. Sandford M.S. Webber T.D. Williams N.E. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the significance of substituents at the C-3 position seems to have been underestimated. Our results on in vitro toxicity, standing on the elucidated biosynthetic pathway (see Fig. 1), led to the assumption that specific O-acetylation at the C-3 position following the second cyclization reaction to give isotrichodermol must be related to a self-defense mechanism for the fungus to produce t-type trichothecenes. This assumption afforded an efficient strategy to isolate a new trichothecene biosynthetic gene,Tri101, that is responsible for the 3-O-acetylation. The present report describes cloning and analysis of Tri101 and its DNA-flanking regions, and the results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of trichothecene biosynthesis.

Since efficient DNA repair in actively growing cells may require growth factor signaling, it was of interest to explore any linkage between EGFR-mediated signaling and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), an enzyme believed to be involved in repairing double strand breaks and V(D)J recombination. We report that anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and not EGFR ligands, trigger a specific early physical interaction between EGFR and a 350-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA or its regulatory heterodimeric complex Ku70/80, in a variety of cell types, both in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of EGFR signaling by anti-EGFR mAb was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of the DNA-PK and its activity in the nuclear fraction. Confocal imaging revealed that a substantial amount of DNA-PK was co-localized with EGFR in anti-EGFR mAb-treated cells. Anti-EGFR mAb-induced physical interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK or Ku70/80 was dependent on the presence of EGFR, but not on the levels of EGFR. The EGFR associated with DNA-PK or Ku70/80 retains its intrinsic kinase activity. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a novel cellular pathway in mammalian cells that involves physical interactions between EGFR and DNA-PK or Ku70/80 in response to inhibition of EGFR signaling.

Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 339-344PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs 528 and 225, raised against the extracellular domain of EGFR, have been shown to bind to the receptors with high affinity comparable with the natural ligand, compete for binding of TGF-α or EGF, and block both ligand-induced activation of EGFR kinase activity and growth stimulation of normal and malignant cells (8Gill G.N.

We report the results of experiments demonstrating specific early physical interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK or Ku70/80 in mammalian cells in response to anti-EGFR mAbs and not in response to EGFR ligands.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDuring an investigation on the expression of DNA-PK in DiFi human colorectal cells (15Wu X. Fan Z. Masui H. Rosen N. Mendelsohn J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar)2 treated with anti-EGFR mAb 225, we observed that immunoprecipitation (IP) of 35S-labeled cell lysates with an antibody (clone 25-4) against the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PK) co-immunoprecipitated a protein of approximate molecular mass of 170 kDa in mAb 225-treated cells, but not in control cells (Fig. 1 A). Based on the size of 170 kDa, we explored the possibility that the observed DNA-PK-associated protein could be EGFR. Supernatants from DNA-PK IP were re-immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR mAb 528 (9Kawamoto T. Sato J.D. Le A. Polikoff J. Sato G.H. Mendelsohn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 10Van de Vijver M.J. Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results indicated that there was almost complete absence of EGFR in lysates of mAb 225-treated cells that had been subjected to IP with anti-DNA-PK mAb (Fig. 1 B). The lower panel in Fig.1 B shows the levels of total EGFR protein in mAb 225-treated lysates of mAb 225-treated DiFi cells as determined by direct immunoblotting with an anti-EGFR mAb (clone 11E8, raised against a fusion protein containing 330 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR) (39Morrison P. Chung K.-C. Rosner M.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14618-14624Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Since activation of DNA-PK requires interaction with its regulatory subunits Ku70 and Ku80, 35S-labeled cell lysates from control and mAb 225-treated (3 h) DiFi cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Ku70/80 mAb that recognizes the Ku70/80 heterodimer or with anti-EGFR mAb 528. Treatment of DiFi cells with mAb 225 also resulted in increased association of a 170-kDa protein band with Ku70/80 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5 and 6). As expected from previous studies (9Kawamoto T. Sato J.D. Le A. Polikoff J. Sato G.H. Mendelsohn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 10Van de Vijver M.J. Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mAb 225 treatment resulted in a modest reduction in newly synthesized EGFR (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3and 4). However, re-IP of supernatants from lanes 3 and 4 with anti-DNA-PK mAb 25-4 demonstrated a significant increase in the levels of co-IP 170-kDa protein band with DNA-PKcs only in mAb 225-treated cell lysates (Fig. 1 C, lanes 7 and 8). Co-immunoprecipitation of35S-labeled 170-kDa protein with DNA-PK was also observed with two other anti-DNA-PK mAbs, clones 18-2 and 42-psc (data not shown). Results in Fig. 1 D demonstrate the specific interaction between DNA-PK and EGFR in DiFi cells treated with mAb 225 for 30 min. In brief, these observations indicated that treatment of DiFi cells with anti-EGFR mAb 225 triggers early physical interaction of a 170-kDa protein (presumably EGFR) with both catalytic and regulatory subunits of DNA-PK.To examine whether the observed interaction between 170-kDa protein and DNA-PK could be also detected during EGFR activation by its ligand, we compared the effect of TGF-α treatment (30 min) on metabolically labeled DiFi cells with that of anti-EGFR mAbs 225 and 528-treated (30 min) cells. As a control, an unrelated antibody 4D5 against HER2 receptor (29Kumar R. Shepard H.M. Mendelsohn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used. DiFi cells have easily detectable levels of HER2 (Fig. 2 B). As expected, activation of EGFR by its ligand TGF-α, but not anti-EGFR mAbs, resulted in a mobility shift of EGFR due to increased phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, in spite of EGFR activation by TGF-α (or EGF, data not shown), there was no co-IP of a 170-kDa protein band with DNA-PK. Treatment of DiFi cells with both anti-EGFR mAbs 225 and 528, and not 4D5, resulted in a rapid association of 170-kDa protein with DNA-PKcs (Fig. 2 A, middle panel, lanes 4 and 5). Association of the 170-kDa EGFR protein band with anti-DNA-PK immunoprecipitates from mAb 225-treated DiFi cells was readily detectable by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). To further establish the identity of 170-kDa protein as EGFR, we next immunprecipitated cell lysates from DiFi cells treated with TGF-α or mAb 225 for 30 min and immunoblotted with anti-DNA-PK mAb or anti-EGFR mAb 11E8 or Ku70/80 mAb. Results in Fig. 2 Cconfirmed that mAb 225 induces the association between EGFR and DNA-PK (lane 3) or Ku70/80 (lane 6). The association of EGFR with DNA-PK was also established by stripping the above blots and re-immunoblotting with an another anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody RK2 (Ref. 40Kris R.M. Lax I. Gullick W.

As a positive control, anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates from control and TGF-α-stimulated A431 cell lysates were used (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2). The EGFR tyrosine kinase displayed the capacity to autophosphorylate EGFR in both anti-DNA-PK and anti-Ku immunoprecipitates from mAb 225-treated DiFi cells (Fig.4 A). There was no effect of TGF-α or mAb 225 treatment upon the status of DNA-PK phosphorylation in these assays (Fig.4 A, lanes 3–5). Subsequent to autoradiography, the identity of the phosphorylated protein bands was confirmed by immunoblotting with specific mAbs against DNA-PK or EGFR (Fig. 4 B). There was no effect of mAb 225 treatment on the activity of DNA-PK in cell lysates, using GAL4-CTD (34Sun S.C. Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E. J. Biol.

Taken together, these results demonstrated that treatment of DiFi cells with anti-EGFR mAb 225, but not with EGFR ligands, leads to interaction of EGFR with DNA-PKcs or Ku70/80.Figure 4Autophosphorylation of EGFR associated with DNA-PK. A, DiFi cells were treated DiFi cells were treated for 30 min without or with 30 nm TGF-α (lanes 5 and 8) or 30 nm mAb 225 (lanes 4 and 7). Two sets of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-DNA-PK mAb (lanes 3–5) or anti-Ku70/80 mAb (lanes 6–8). As EGFR kinase control, A431 cells were treated with 30 nm TGF-α for 15 min and immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR mAb 528 (lanes 1 and2). After immunoprecipitated, one set of precipitated EGFR was subjected to in vitro kinase assay, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and autoradiograph resulted from 1-h exposure is shown here (upper panel). The second set of precipitated EGFR was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphate-Tyr. mAb PY-20 (lower panel). B, to confirm the identity of phosphorylated protein bands in A (upper panel), subsequent to autoradiography, the membrane was blotted with DNA-PK or EGFR mAbs, using a color reaction method of detection (as in Fig.1 B, lower panel). C, DNA-PK associates with EGFRin vitro. DNA-PK and Ku70/80 were purified from U266 cells by IP, and the beads were further incubated for 2 h with cell lysates from control and mAb 225-treated (30 nm) HER14 cells. Beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with DNA-PK (upper panel) or EGFR (middle panel) or Ku80 (lower panel) mAbs from the same blot. D, DiFi cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 h and treated with or without 30 nm mAb 225 in the presence or absence of wortmannin (Wort) (Sigma) or tyrphostin A9 (Tyroph) (Calbiochem) for 30 min before preparing cell lysates. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-DNA-PK mAb 25–4 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further study the interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK, we next performed mixing experiments involving isolation of DNA-PK or Ku70/80 from U266 human leukemic cells that lack EGFR and then incubation with cell lysates from HER14 cells. DNA-PK and Ku70/80 immunoprecipitates from U266 cells were incubated for 2 h with cell lysates from control or mAb 225-treated HER14 cells, and the beads were washed and immunoblotted with anti-EGFR mAb 11E8 or control antibodies. Results in Fig. 4 C demonstrate that EGFR from mAb 225-treated HER14 cells, and not from untreated HER14 cells, interacted with DNA-PK and Ku70/80. DNA-PK has been shown to have significant homology with PI 3-kinase, which is a downstream target of EGFR signaling. Most, if not all, known functions of EGFR require EGFR kinase activity. We examined the involvement of PI 3-kinase and EGFR kinase in mediating the interaction between DNA-PK and EGFR. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the EGFR kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A9 did not prevent the interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK in DiFi cells (Fig.4 D). As expected, tyrphostin A9 reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR, as demonstrated by the band shift in lanes 5 and6.DNA-PK has been shown to be primarily localized in the nucleus (21Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 412-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 22Weaver D.T.

Harwood Academy Publishers, Amsterdam, Netherlands1997: 33-84Google Scholar). Our finding of physical interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK has raised the possibility of redistribution of DNA-PK in response to anti-EGFR mAbs. To examine the effect of mAb 225 on the subcellular localization of DNA-PK, DiFi cells were treated with mAb 225 for 30 min, and cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared. As expected, a major fraction of DNA-PK was localized in the nucleus and a minor fraction in the cytosol (Fig. 5 A, upper panel), and EGFR was present in the cytosol (Fig. 5 A, middle panel). Treatment with mAb 225 was accompanied by a reduction in the level of nuclear DNA-PK. Ku80 was localized in the cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Subcellular fractionation of35S-labeled DiFi cells treated with mAb 225 indicated that EGFR interacts with the cytosolic fraction of DNA-PK (Fig. 5 B, lane 2) and also confirmed a decrease in the amount of the nuclear DNA-PK (Fig. 5 B, compare lane 4 with lane 3). To determine whether the observed reduction in the amount of the nuclear DNA-PK is functional, we measured the DNA-PK kinase activity in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions from control and mAb 225-treated DiFi cells using a peptide substrate specific for DNA-PK (36Lees-Miller S.P.

C, 10μg of cytosolic (open bars) or nuclear (solid bars) extracts from control or mAb 225-treated DiFi cells were assayed for DNA-PK activity as described (34Sun S.C. Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E. J.

As a control, mAb 225-treated DiFi cells were stained without DNA-PK mAb (Fig. 6 D, red staining).

We describe the isolation of two yeast genes (ALR1 and ALR2) which confer increased tolerance to Al3+ and Ga3+ ions when overexpressed while increasing strain sensitivity to Zn2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, and La3+ ions. The Alr proteins are homologous to theSalmonella typhimurium CorA protein, a bacterial Mg2+ and Co2+ transport system located in the periplasmic membrane. Yeast strains lacking ALR gene activity required additional Mg2+ for growth, and expression of either ALR1 or ALR2 corrected the Mg2+-requiring phenotype. The results suggest that theALR genes encode the yeast uptake system for Mg2+ and other divalent cations. This hypothesis was supported by evidence that 57Co2+ accumulation was elevated in ALR-overexpressing strains and reduced in strains lacking ALR expression. ALRoverexpression also overcame the inhibition of Co2+ uptake by Al3+ ions. The results indicate that aluminum toxicity to yeast occurs as a consequence of reduced Mg2+ influx via the Alr proteins. The molecular identification of the yeast Mg2+ transport system should lead to a better understanding of the regulation of Mg2+ homeostasis in eukaryote cells.

Aluminum is the most abundant metallic element, constituting about 8% by weight of the outer crust of the Earth (1Moeller T. Bailar J.C. Kleinberg J. Guss C.O. Castellion M.E. Metz C. Chemistry with Inorganic Qualitative Analysis. Academic Press, Orlando1984: 929Google Scholar). In neutral to slightly acidic conditions (pH > 6) aluminum is locked in silicate and oxide minerals and is consequently nontoxic. In more acidic conditions, however, aluminum is leached from insoluble forms, and the bioavailability and toxicity of the element are increased. The pH-dependent chemistry of aluminum may be one reason why, despite its abundance in the environment, the Al3+ ion does not appear to be utilized for any biological purpose and is generally recognized to be nonessential for life (2Exley C. Birchall J.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1992; 159: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Ionic aluminum is toxic to many organisms including microbes (3Piña R.G. Cervantes C. Biometals. 1996; 9: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), plants (4Kochian L.V. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 237-260Crossref Scopus (1455) Google Scholar), fish (5Driscoll C.T. Baker J.P. Bisogni J.J. Schofield C.L. Nature. 1980; 284: 161-164Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and mammals (6Wisniewski H.M. Moretz R.C. Sturman J.A. Wen G.Y. Shek J.W. Env. Geochem. Health. 1990; 12: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Despite a plethora of hypotheses regarding the mechanism of toxicity, no clear consensus has emerged (4Kochian L.V. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 237-260Crossref Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). The economic impact of aluminum toxicity to agriculture has focused research interest on the effects of ionic aluminum in plant systems. Aluminum-tolerant cultivars have been obtained by conventional breeding (7Aniol A. Wright R.J. Baligar V.C. Murrmann R.P. Plant-Soil Interactions at Low pH. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1991: 1007-1017Crossref Google Scholar), but this approach is limited by the availability of suitable aluminum-tolerant germplasm. Very recently, a gene transfer strategy was used successfully to increase the aluminum tolerance of tobacco and papaya (8de la Fuente J.M. Ramı́rez-Rodrı́guez V. Cabrera-Ponce J.L. Herrera-Estrella L. Science. 1997; 276: 1566-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Expression of a bacterial citrate synthase gene resulted in increased citrate secretion from roots. The aluminum tolerance of the transgenic plants presumably occurred as a consequence of citrate binding and detoxifying aluminum outside the plant cell. This result is very promising from a biotechnological standpoint, but it is likely that a range of genes will be required to confer high levels of aluminum tolerance. Moreover, the result reveals little about the mechanism of aluminum toxicity to plant cells. A better understanding of aluminum toxicity will allow more directed genetic improvements to be made, leading to increased levels of tolerance. The genetic analysis of metal ion toxicity has been accelerated by the use of microbial model systems to clone and analyze genes contributing to metal tolerance. To this end, we have described conditions that enable the use of bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for the genetic analysis of aluminum toxicity (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). During this work, aluminum toxicity was found to be ameliorated by Mg2+ ions, and Al3+ ion was found to inhibit the Mg2+ and Co2+ uptake system. The results suggested that Al3+ induced Mg2+ deficiency in yeast. In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of two yeast genes (ALR1 and ALR2) which increase aluminum resistance when overexpressed. The ALR genes encode redundant systems mediating the influx of several divalent cations, including Mg2+. Our results provide genetic confirmation that the inhibition of Mg2+ uptake is the primary cause of aluminum toxicity to yeast. Yeast were grown in standard synthetic or complete culture media (SC and YPD, respectively; Ref. 10Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), with the required auxotrophic supplements and 2% glucose, galactose or raffinose. Methods for yeast transformation and plasmid rescue were as described (11Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 141-143Google Scholar, 12Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Yeast strains used were: SH2332 (MATa pho3–1 pho4::HIS3 his3–532 leu2–3,112 ura3–1,2 trp1–289 ade2), CG379 (MATa ade5 can1 leu2–3,112 trp1–289aura3–52 gal2 [Kil-0]), CM45 (MATαalr1::HIS3), CM46 (MATaalr1::HIS3 alr2::URA3), CM48 (MATaalr2::URA3), and CM52 (MATα ALR1 ALR2). The last four strains are isogenic derivatives of the FY series (13Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) and share the additional markers his3-Δ200, ura3–52, leu2-Δ1, lys2-Δ202, andtrp1-Δ63. ALR1 and ALR2 deletion mutants were generated by one-step gene disruption (11Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 141-143Google Scholar) using thealr1::HIS3 polymerase chain reaction product or the palr2::URA3 plasmid (Fig. 1). Correct disruption was verified by Southern hybridization (data not shown). To assay cation tolerance, cultures were grown in SC-uracil medium (2% glucose), and dilutions were applied to synthetic media with 2% galactose. The toxicity of trivalent metals was tested using a synthetic medium with a low magnesium content (LPM medium with 100 μm Mg2+, pH 3.8) (12Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Trivalent metals were added to concentrations of 100 μm Al3+, 150 μm Ga3+, 500 μmLa3+, or 10 μm In3+. The toxicity of divalent cations was tested using LPM medium with 2 mmMg2+ and toxic divalent cations added to give concentrations of 1 mm Co2+, 5 mmZn2+, 250 μm Ni2+, 3 mm Mn2+, 500 μm Cu2+, or 20 μm Cd2+. Ca2+ sensitivity was tested using low sulfate SC-uracil medium with 500 mmCaCl2 (14Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most constructs were generated by restriction fragment subcloning (see Fig.1) (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1-1.110Google Scholar). pSHA20Δ3, pA8Δ4, and pA8Δ6 are deletion derivatives of pSHA20 and pCGA8. pCMA20–1 and pCMA81 were derived from pFL46-S (2 μLEU2) (16Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) containing subcloned restriction fragments of the pSHA20 and pCGA8 inserts, respectively. To construct YCpALR1and YEpALR1, a fragment of pSHA20 containing theALR1 gene was subcloned into the pFL38 (ARS/CEN, URA3) or pFL44-S (2 μ origin, URA3) shuttle vectors (16Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). YCpALR2 and YEpALR2 contain pCGA8 insert DNA subcloned into pFL38 or pFL44-S. For construction ofGAL1 promoter gene fusions (YEpGALR1 andYEpGALR2), the ALR1 and ALR2 coding sequences were amplified using the High Fidelity polymerase chain reaction kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and the following oligonucleotides (Fig. 1), 5′-GGCCTCGAGCGAATATTGCTAGAAAGCGT-3′ (primer 1), 5′-CGGCGGCCGCCACATCACTAATCAGTCGT-3′ (primer 2), 5′-GGCCTCGAGCTTCGTAATGTCGTCCTTATC-3′ (primer 3), and 5′-CGGCGGCCGCAGATCTGCCGACCTACCATA-3′ (primer 4). The polymerase chain reaction products were cleaved and ligated into the NotI andSalI sites of the pYES3 expression vector (2 μ URA3 GAL1p) (17Smith F.W. Hawkesford M.J. Prosser I.M. Clarkson D.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The alr1::HIS3polymerase chain reaction product was amplified from theHIS3 gene using oligonucleotides with flankingALR1 homology (18Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were as follows. His31A was 5′-CCATCCAATGACCCGGCGTATTGCTCTTACCAGGGTACAGACTTTGGCCTCCTCTAGTACACTC-3′. His32B was 5′-TTTGGCTCCACTTTCAGCGGCCTCGTTAAGTGTTGCAGGAGGGTCCTTGCCACCTATCACCACA-3′. Plasmid palr2::URA3 was constructed as follows (Fig. 1). A XhoI fragment encompassing ALR2 was subcloned into pBC (Stratagene) to create pBC5. The central BglII fragment of the pBC5 insert was then replaced with the URA3 gene from pFL38. This deletion inactivated ALR2, as determined by the lack of aluminum resistance conferred by plasmid pA8Δ6 (Fig. 1). Thepalr2::URA3 plasmid was digested withXhoI prior to yeast transformation. To predict membrane-spanning regions within proteins, related protein sequences were aligned using Pileup (19Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) and the alignment interpreted using PHDhtm (20Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Conventional hydropathy plots were generated using Top-PredII (21Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Cabios Application Notes. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar). Co2+ uptake by cell suspensions was assayed as described (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), using 200 μm total Co2+. To measure uptake in overexpressing strains, yeast were grown in SC-uracil with 2% raffinose, and the GAL1 promoter was induced by the addition of galactose (2%) to cultures at early log phase. After a 3-h induction, cells were harvested, washed, and pretreated with 1% galactose and 1% raffinose at 25 °C for 20 min before addition of the tracer. A genomic library of strain S288C in a high copy episomal vector (22Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) was introduced into the SH2332 and CG379 yeast strains by transformation. A modified synthetic medium with 200 μm Mg2+ and 200 μm ionic Al3+ (LPM) (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used to select aluminum-resistant transformants. Plasmids were rescued from tolerant strains, and those that reconferred Al3+ resistance to the original strain were selected. After restriction mapping and Southern analysis (not shown), two plasmids (pSHA20 and pCGA8; Fig. 1) were representative of the six isolated. Deletion mapping of the clones, partial sequence analysis, and comparison with the yeast genome sequence identified two previously uncharacterized open reading frames on chromosomes XV and VI (YOL130w and YFL050c) as responsible for the aluminum resistance (Fig. 1). These two genes were designatedALR1 and ALR2, respectively. ALR1 and ALR2 encode closely related proteins (70% identity) with similar molecular masses (95.9 and 96.7 kDa, respectively) and isoelectric points (6.24 and 6.28, respectively). Data base searches revealed that the Alr proteins shared 34% identity with the product of the yeast YKL064w gene on chromosome XI (Fig. 2, A andB) (23Rasmussen S.W. Yeast. 1994; 10: S63-S68Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Searches also revealed that the Alr proteins show a low level of similarity to Salmonella typhimurium CorA, a periplasmic membrane protein known to transport divalent cations including Mg2+ and Co2+ (24Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. typhimurium CorA is the best characterized member of a large bacterial gene family. The ALR1, ALR2, and YKL064w proteins share several structural features with CorA, including a highly charged N-terminal domain (greatly expanded in the yeast proteins; Fig. 2 B) and two C-terminal hydrophobic regions. Hydropathy analysis indicates that these regions are likely to form transmembrane domains (Fig. 2 B, black bars). A third region of the CorA protein known to be membrane-spanning (Fig.2 B, gray bar) was not predicted by the algorithms used here (data not shown). The similarity of the CorA and ALR genes suggested that the latter are involved in divalent cation transport. For this reason we characterized the effect of increased ALR gene expression on resistance to various divalent and trivalent metal ions. To maximizeALR gene expression, the coding sequences of both genes were fused to the strong GAL1 promoter in a multicopy plasmid. Fig. 3 shows that the ALRgenes conferred increased resistance to Al3+ and Ga3+ (but not In3+) and increased sensitivity to Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, La3+, and Cu2+ (but not Cd2+). Several of these divalent cations have been implicated as substrates for the same yeast cation transport system, either via uptake studies (26Fuhrmann G.-F. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 163: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Norris P.R. Kelly D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 99: 317-324Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Okorokov L.A. Lichko L.P. Kadomtseva V.M. Kholodenko V.P. Titovsky V.T. Kulaev I.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or by a genetic correlation (29Conklin D.S. Kung C. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2041-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enhanced sensitivity to divalent cations seen in strains overexpressing either ALR gene is consistent with the ALR genes encoding such an influx system. TheYEpGALR1 construct was generally less effective thanYEpGALR2 at altering metal tolerance (evident in the results for Cu2+ and Ca2+, Fig. 3); the reason for this difference is unclear. To define further the role of the ALRgenes, mutant strains were obtained by gene disruption (Fig. 1; see also “Experimental Procedures”) using yeast strains derived from S288C (13Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Haploid strains carrying the expectedalr2::URA3 allele were viable, and no novel phenotype was observed to be associated with this marker in subsequent crosses. These results indicate that the ALR2gene is not essential for growth. In contrast, ALR1 could not be disrupted in a haploid strain. Segregation analysis of analr1::HIS3/+ heterozygous diploid strain confirmed that ALR1 inactivation was lethal (not shown). In an attempt to rescue haploid alr1 mutants, spores were dissected to a variety of growth conditions. The growth ofalr1 mutants was increased substantially by supplementation with additional Mg2+ (50–500 mmMgCl2 or MgSO4; Fig.4). However, no growth was observed on media with high salt (1 m NaCl), high calcium (100–500 mm CaCl2), or osmotic stabilizers (1m sorbitol, 1 m glucose), or after incubation at a lower temperature (25 °C) (data not shown). The phenotype of the alr1 mutation suggested a defect in Mg2+ uptake was present in alr1 strains. In contrast, no phenotype was observed to be associated with thealr2 mutation, and alr1 alr2 double mutant strains had the same Mg2+-dependent phenotype as alr1 single mutants (data not shown). The similarity of the overexpression phenotypes conferred by the ALR genes (Fig. 3) had suggested that the two genes might perform a similar function. To test this hypothesis, we introduced plasmids carryingALR2 into an alr1 mutant strain. Increased copy number of an ALR2 genomic clone, or transcription of theALR2 coding sequence from a heterologous promoter, eliminated the Mg2+-dependent phenotype of thealr1 mutant (Fig. 4). Only a small increase inALR2 expression (that conferred by an extra one or two copies/cell) was required to correct the alr1 defect. Together with the similar phenotypes shown in Fig. 3, this result suggested that the ALR genes were functionally redundant but that ALR2 was normally not expressed in the S288C genetic background. Poor expression of ALR2 in some strains is consistent with later observations that increased copy number of anALR2 genomic clone did not confer Al3+ tolerance to FY73 (a strain derived from S288C), although tolerance of the SH2332 and CG379 strains was increased (data not shown). To measure transcription of the ALR genes, Northern hybridization was performed using total RNA extracted from FY73. A 3-kilobase pair transcript hybridizing to an ALR1 probe was detected in these experiments, but no mRNA species was observed to hybridize to an ALR2-specific probe (data not shown). The sequence of the ALR2 gene and surrounding regions was examined for features that could potentially affect ALR2expression. Two autonomous replication sequences were found close to the 3′-end of ALR2 (ARS601 and 602) (30Shirahige K. Iwasaki T. Rashid M.B. Ogasawara N. Yoshikawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5043-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In yeast, ARS elements are thought to contribute to the silencing of nearby genes (31Diffley J.F. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Triolo T. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 381: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition to this potential for transcriptional silencing, the ALR2 coding sequence is directly preceded by a small (27 nucleotides) reading frame of unknown function. If this reading frame is included in the ALR2 mRNA, it may negatively affect translation from the ALR2 start codon (33Schneider J.C. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). No equivalent reading frame is present in the 5′-region of the ALR1 gene. The ALR2 5′-untranslated region was not included inYEpGALR2, so it would not be expected to interfere withALR2 expression from this construct. We determined the effect of altered ALR gene expression on divalent cation accumulation, using 57Co2+ as a tracer. Co2+ has been reported to be accumulated by the yeast Mg2+ transport system (26Fuhrmann G.-F. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 163: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Conklin D.S. Kung C. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2041-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was used as a substitute for the unavailable 28Mg2+ isotope. As described previously (27Norris P.R. Kelly D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 99: 317-324Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar), Co2+ uptake was energy-dependent: the addition of a fermentative carbon source was required, and tracer accumulation was inhibited by low temperature (0 °C) or the presence of the metabolic uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (250 μm, data not shown). The rate of uptake was dependent on the Co2+ concentration, and the uptake system was saturable (data not shown). Together these observations indicated that Co2+ uptake was mediated by an enzyme-like transport system in yeast. The alr1 mutation was associated with a lower rate of Co2+ uptake than found for the wild type, whereas deletion of ALR2 had no effect (Fig.5 A). As measurement of Co2+ uptake required growth of alr1 mutants in medium with 500 mm Mg2+, wild-type (ALR1) strains were grown with normal and high Mg2+ concentrations prior to the assay. Transport byALR1 wild-type strains was decreased substantially by growth in 500 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 5 A), butalr1 mutants still exhibited significantly less uptake thanALR1 wild-type strains under equivalent conditions. Strains overexpressing either ALR gene showed greatly increased Co2+ uptake (Fig. 5 B). Because overexpression of the ALR genes altered Al3+ tolerance, the effect of Al3+ on Co2+ uptake in strains overexpressing the ALR genes was also tested. Al3+ strongly inhibited Co2+ uptake in the control strain (Fig. 5 B), but strains overexpressing eitherALR gene maintained a robust uptake capacity that was equal to, or greater than, the control strain without Al3+. Previous work suggests that Mg2+enters the yeast cell via a low affinity transport system, which can also accumulate Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Ni2+ ions (26Fuhrmann G.-F. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 163: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Norris P.R. Kelly D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 99: 317-324Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Okorokov L.A. Lichko L.P. Kadomtseva V.M. Kholodenko V.P. Titovsky V.T. Kulaev I.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Conklin D.S. Kung C. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2041-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with theALR genes encoding this transport system. Clear evidence that both the Alr proteins transport Mg2+ came from the Mg2+-dependent growth of alr1mutants, which could be corrected by increased ALR2expression. The increased sensitivity of overexpressing strains to Co2+, Mn2+ Ni2+, and Zn2+ is consistent with the Alr proteins directing the influx of these divalent cations. Use of a57Co2+ tracer revealed increased Co2+ accumulation in overexpressing strains and reduced uptake in alr1 mutant strains. The observed differences between the effects of the alr1 and alr2mutations can be explained simply, by poor expression ofALR2 in the S288C genetic background. Despite the broad substrate specificity of the Alr proteins, two lines of evidence suggest that the main physiological role of these systems is to allow Mg2+ influx. First, an increased requirement for divalent cations other than Mg2+ was not observed inalr1 strains. Second, specific uptake systems for Mn2+ (34Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), Zn2+ (35Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and Cu2+ (36Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) have been identified previously in yeast. These systems typically display a high affinity for their substrates, with reportedK m values of 1–4 μm (35Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 36Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In contrast, the K m determined for Co2+uptake via the Alr proteins ranges from 77 μm (27Norris P.R. Kelly D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 99: 317-324Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar) to 105 μm. 1C. W. MacDiarmid and R. C. Gardner, unpublished data. Given the low requirement of yeast for divalent cations other than Mg2+ (37Loukin S. Kung C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the Alr proteins are unlikely to contribute to the accumulation of such cations at physiologically significant concentrations. The location of the Alr proteins in the cell has not been determined directly. However, the results reported here support their assignment to the plasma membrane. First, the related CorA protein is known to mediate Mg2+ influx over the bacterial periplasmic membrane (25Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, inactivation of ALR1increased the yeast requirement for Mg2+. Yeast mutants lacking plasma membrane-localized systems required for nutrient uptake commonly display an increased requirement for particular nutrients, for example SO42−, K+, or NH4+ ions (17Smith F.W. Hawkesford M.J. Prosser I.M. Clarkson D.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 39Marini A.M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. André B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3456-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Third, the results of tracer uptake assays are consistent with the Alr proteins mediating the uptake of Co2+ over the plasma membrane. Overexpression of the ALR genes increased Co2+uptake, and loss of ALR gene activity reduced uptake. Parallel changes in uptake rates have been observed in yeast with altered expression of other plasma membrane cation transport systems (34Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 35Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 36Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Although increased expression of transporters located in organelle membranes can also enhance ion uptake (for example, the Zrc1 and Cot1 proteins; Ref. 40Conklin D.S. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is unusual for the inactivation of such systems to result in an increased requirement for the transporter substrate. Hence, the phenotypes associated with altered ALRgene expression strongly suggest that these proteins mediate cation influx over the yeast plasma membrane. The energy dependence of Co2+ uptake by yeast and its sensitivity to 2,4-dinitrophenol (an uncoupler of transmembrane proton gradients) suggested that the Alr proteins mediate active transport, possibly via a proton-coupled symport mechanism. However, passive cation influx via a channel-like system may also be dependent on metabolic energy and the proton gradient, since both these factors would affect the electrical potential generated by the activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. It has been proposed that this electrical potential difference alone could drive sufficient Mg2+ uptake by bacterial and eukaryote cells (41Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 42Maguire M.E. Snavely M.D. Leizman J.B. Gura S. Bagga D. Tao T. Smith D.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 244-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For these reasons it is also possible that the CorA protein family (including the Alr proteins) could represent a new class of divalent cation channel. Apparent Mg2+-specific channel activities have been described in other eukaryotes. For example, in the yeastsSchizosaccharomyces pombe and Kluyveromyces fragilis, rapid and short lived influx of Mg2+ occurs just prior to cell division, suggesting that a channel-like activity is transiently activated (43Walker G.M. Duffus J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1980; 42: 329-356PubMed Google Scholar). In Paramecium tetraurelia, a novel Mg2+-specific channel has been characterized using electrophysiological methods (44Preston R.R. Science. 1990; 250: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); and in mammalian kidney cells, a tightly regulated transport system is responsible for Mg2+influx after depletion of internal Mg2+ stores (45Dai L.-J. Quamme G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The use of newly available methods to investigate yeast electrophysiology, combined with the mutant strains described in this work, may enable the definition of the mechanism of cation influx via the Alr proteins. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the role of Mg2+ in the control of cell growth and development. Although most intracellular Mg2+ is bound, the concentration of free ionized Mg2+ can alter rapidly in response to environmental signals (46Maguire M.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 551: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In S. pombe andK. fragilis, the level of intracellular Mg2+regulates the timing of cell cycle progression (43Walker G.M. Duffus J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1980; 42: 329-356PubMed Google Scholar, 47Walker G.M. Magnesium. 1986; 5: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar). Mg2+ is also required for germ tube formation inCandida albicans vegetative cells and consequently regulates the morphogenesis and pathogenicity of this species (48Walker G.M. Sullivan P.A. Shepherd M.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1941-1945PubMed Google Scholar). Free ionized Mg2+ has been proposed to regulate cell growth and division in some mammalian cells (46Maguire M.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 551: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), possibly via an effect on the activity of enzymes involved in signal transduction (49Chien M.M. Cambier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9201-9207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Study of the regulation of free ionized Mg2+ in the cytoplasm is hampered by a lack of molecular information on Mg2+ transport by eukaryote cells. The conditional lethal phenotype of alr1 mutants may allow the molecular cloning of other Mg2+ transporters via functional complementation, as has been achieved successfully for other nutrient transporters (50Frommer W.B. Ninnemann O. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 419-444Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although previous work in our laboratory characterized mutations that conferred increased aluminum sensitivity to yeast (51Schott E.J. Gardner R.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), this is the first report of the identification and molecular characterization of a gene capable of increasing yeast aluminum resistance. The identification of theALR genes provides genetic support for the proposal that, under conditions of low Mg2+ availability, Al3+prevents Mg2+ uptake by yeast and consequently induces Mg2+ deficiency (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The results described here show that increased activity of the yeast Mg2+ transport system confers aluminum resistance (Fig. 3) and also overcomes the inhibition of cation uptake by aluminum (Fig. 5). Our results also suggest that Ga3+ and Al3+ ions may be similar in their mechanism of action; these two cations have similar effects on growth and Co2+ uptake (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and ALR gene overexpression confers tolerance to both (Fig. 3). In contrast, La3+ is an ineffective inhibitor of the Mg2+ uptake system (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), andALR overexpression increased La3+ toxicity, suggesting that this trivalent cation effectively permeates the Mg2+ transporter. Several parallels exist between our observations in yeast and Al3+ toxicity to plants. Mg2+ ameliorates Al3+ toxicity (52Kinraide T.B. Parker D.R. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 546-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Tan K. Keltjens W.G. Findenegg G.R. Plant Soil. 1991; 136: 65-71Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Mg2+ deficiency is observed in aluminum-intoxicated cereals and grasses (53Tan K. Keltjens W.G. Findenegg G.R. Plant Soil. 1991; 136: 65-71Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 54Wheeler D.M. Edmeades D.C. Christie R.A. J. Plant Nutr. 1992; 15: 387-402Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 55Tan K. Keltjens W.G. Plant Soil. 1995; 171: 147-150Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, Al3+ has inhibitory effects on Mg2+uptake by root cells (56Rengel Z. Robinson D.L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Robinson D.L. Rengel Z. Curr. Top. Plant Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 10: 107-116Google Scholar, 58Schimansky C. Z. Pflanzenernähr. Bodenk. 1991; 154: 195-198Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, there are also key differences between the two systems. The most immediate symptom of Al3+toxicity to plants is the inhibition of root elongation (4Kochian L.V. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 237-260Crossref Scopus (1455) Google Scholar), an effect that is not duplicated by the reduced availability of Mg2+(52Kinraide T.B. Parker D.R. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 546-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, an Al3+-induced reduction in Mg2+ uptake could contribute to the low yields observed in species such as the Graminae, where Mg2+ deficiency is a notable feature of long term exposure to Al3+ (53Tan K. Keltjens W.G. Findenegg G.R. Plant Soil. 1991; 136: 65-71Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 54Wheeler D.M. Edmeades D.C. Christie R.A. J.

Expression of the ALR genes in aluminum-sensitive plant species may be one way to investigate the interaction between Mg2+ utilization and aluminum toxicity to plants. We thank A.

https://openalex.org/W2049240980,"In an attempt to identify proteins that might underlie membrane trafficking processes in ciliates, calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding proteins were isolated from extracts of Paramecium tetraurelia. The major protein obtained, named copine, had a mass of 55 kDa, bound phosphatidylserine but not phosphatidylcholine at micromolar levels of calcium but not magnesium, and promoted lipid vesicle aggregation. The sequence of a 920-base pair partial cDNA revealed that copine is a novel protein that contains a C2 domain likely to be responsible for its membrane active properties. Paramecium was found to have two closely related copine genes, CPN1 andCPN2. Current sequence data bases indicate the presence of multiple copine homologs in green plants, nematodes, and humans. The full-length sequences reveal that copines consist of two C2 domains at the N terminus followed by a domain similar to the A domain that mediates interactions between integrins and extracellular ligands. A human homolog, copine I, was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. This recombinant protein exhibited calcium-dependent phospholipid binding properties similar to those of Paramecium copine. An antiserum raised against a fragment of human copine I was used to identify chromobindin 17, a secretory vesicle-binding protein, as a copine. This association with secretory vesicles, as well the general ability of copines to bind phospholipid bilayers in a calcium-dependent manner, suggests that these proteins may function in membrane trafficking.

This association with secretory vesicles, as well the general ability of copines to bind phospholipid bilayers in a calcium-dependent manner, suggests that these proteins may function in membrane trafficking. Molecular life at the interface of the cell membrane and the cytoplasmic milieu may be regulated by proteins that attach to and detach from the membrane surface in response to signals. Calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins may play such a role. Two major protein motifs that regulate calcium-dependent interactions with membrane lipids have been extensively characterized: The annexin fold (1Huber R. Romisch J. Paques E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and the C2 domain (3Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 4Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The annexin fold appears in quartets in the annexin family of proteins. The structure of these proteins, which has been solved (1Huber R. Romisch J. Paques E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), consists only of the calcium and lipid binding domains, with the exception of generally short amino-terminal domains that provide additional regulation of the annexin or binding sites for other proteins. In contrast, the C2 domain, for which the structure is also known (3Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), is a motif that is attached to a diverse array of enzymatic or protein interaction domains to provide calcium and/or lipid regulation of functions inherent in other portions of the protein. Examples of C2 domain-containing proteins include protein kinase C (5Parker P.J. Coussens L. Totty N. Rhee L. Young S. Chen E. Stabel S. Waterfield M.D. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), phospholipase C (6Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), synaptotagmin (7Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), rabphilin (8Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), Doc2 (9Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komura R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The absence of clear enzymatic activities has made the functions of the annexins difficult to determine. Their interaction with membranes can lead to modulation of other membrane-binding proteins such as phospholipases (11Wallner B.P. Mattaliano R.J. Hession C. Cate R.L. Tizard R. Sinclair L.K. Foeller C. Chow E.P. Browning J.L. Ramachandran K.L. Pepinsky R.B. Nature. 1986; 320: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). They also exhibit a “bivalent” activity in the sense that they can bind to two membranes and therefore draw them together into a complex that is subject to fusion with additional perturbation of membrane structure (2Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 12Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13Creutz C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This activity, as well as relevant localizations of some annexins (14Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 15Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Sagot I. Delouche B. Dirrig S. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1217-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), has led to the proposal that the annexins may mediate membrane-trafficking events. However, some proteins containing C2 domains, such as the cytoplasmic portion of synaptotagmin, are endowed with similar attributes (16Damer C.K. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so it is difficult to define activities unique to annexins. We recently attempted to characterize calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins from Paramecium tetraureliabecause of some of the unique cytological and genetic characteristics of this organism. Our approach depended on the isolation of membrane-binding proteins from EGTA extracts of homogenized cells, an approach that has been very effective in isolating annexins from a wide variety of organisms (17Creutz C.E. Snyder S.L. Daigle S.N. Redick J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1079-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Gerke V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1697-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Smallwood M. Keen J.N. Bowles D.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the major protein we obtained from Paramecium by this approach was not an annexin but a novel protein with two copies of the C2 domain and one copy of a domain related to the A domain that mediates protein-protein interactions between integrins and their extracellular ligands. Because the Paramecium protein associates with lipid membranes, like a “companion,” we have given the protein a name reflecting this property: copine (pronounced “ko-peen′”), from the French feminine noun copine, which means “friend.” P. tetraurelia, wild-type stock d4–2, was grown at 27 °C in an infusion of wheat grass powder (Pines International, Lawrence, KS) inoculated with Klebsiella pneumoniae and supplemented with β-sitosterol (4 μg/ml) according to Sonneborn (20Sonneborn T.M. Methods Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 241-339Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Twelve to 18 liters of cell culture at a density of 2,000–4,000 cells/ml were harvested by centrifugation yielding a wet cell pellet of 5–10 ml. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The cells were washed once with spring water (Volvic) and resuspended in 3 volumes of homogenization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μm leupeptin). The cells were homogenized with 40 strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a tightly fitting pestle. The volume was increased to 50 ml by the addition of homogenizing buffer, and the cells were further homogenized with five strokes of a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer. By phase microscopy it was found that this procedure resulted in the lysis of all cells, but large organelles appeared intact. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 1 h to prepare a postmicrosomal supernatant. Multilamellar liposomes were prepared from 200 mg of a bovine brain lipid fraction enriched to 80% in phosphatidylserine (Sigma product B-1502) by sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, as described previously (21Creutz C.E. Kambouris N.G. Snyder S.L. Hamman H.C. Nelson M.R. Liu W. Rock P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1177-1192PubMed Google Scholar). The vesicles were pelleted at 200,000 × g for 1 h, and the postmicrosomal supernatant was used to resuspend the lipid pellet with 10 strokes of a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer. The free calcium level of the suspension was adjusted to approximately 3 mmby the addition of 8 mm CaCl2. The pH, reduced by release of protons from EGTA, was returned to 7.4 by the addition of NaOH. The vesicles were sedimented by centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 1 h, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmleupeptin) by 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer (first wash). The vesicles were sedimented as above and then resuspended in wash buffer without NaCl (second wash). After sedimentation, the vesicles were resuspended in 10 ml of extracting buffer (25 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sedimented as above. The supernatant, containing calcium-dependent lipid-binding proteins, was saved. The lipid pellet was resuspended in extracting buffer again and sedimented as before, providing a second extract. In some cases a third extraction was performed, yielding about 20% additional protein. The extracts from the lipid vesicles were pooled and applied to a Poros Q anion exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The flow-through fractions from this column contained the purified copine. Phospholipid binding activity of purified copine was determined by incubation of 5 μg of copine with 0.5–1 mg of phospholipid vesicles prepared as for the purification procedure above in the presence of 2 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 8 mm EGTA, with or without 10 mmCaCl2 or MgCl2 at room temperature. After sedimentation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, or 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were desalted on Sephadex G-25 and lyophilized before applying to SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The pellets were resuspended directly in gel starting buffer and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The aggregation of lipid vesicles was determined by measurement of the turbidity (absorbance at 540 nm) of the vesicle suspensions in the binding assay after incubation with 5 μg of copine for 30 min to 1 h. 50 μg of purified copine was applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The 55-kDa band was stained with Coomassie Blue and excised, and the protein was isolated by electroelution in an Amicon electroelution cell by application of 100 V for 2 h. SDS was removed from the eluted protein by precipitation of the protein in chloroform and methanol (23Wessel D. Flugge D.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). The protein was then subjected to digestion with lysyl endoprotease purified fromAchromobacter lyticus (Waco Products, Richmond, VA), and the resulting peptides were isolated by HPLC, as described (24Brownawell A.M. Creutz C.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6839-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas phase sequencer coupled to a 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to the peptide sequences, favoring codon usage in Paramecium (25Martindale D.W. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Successful PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. reactions (see “Results”) were obtained using the following primers, which incorporated EcoRI restriction sites (underlined). Note that the design of these primers takes advantage of the almost exclusive use by Paramecium of AGA as the codon for arginine (25Martindale D.W. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Standard PCRs were conducted with Taqpolymerase and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. cDNA from P. tetraurelia, prepared as described by Madeddu et al. (26Madeddu L. Gautier M.-C. Vayssie L. Houari A. Sperling L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was used as template. The major product had an apparent size of 900 base pairs on an agarose gel. It was eluted and subcloned into the plasmid Bluescript SK after digestion with EcoRI. Because of the presence of internalEcoRI restriction sites in the PCR product, interpretation of the sequence was not straightforward. Therefore, a second PCR product obtained using the same primers and cDNA sample was subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for sequencing. The clones obtained by these two procedures arose from different genes (see “Results”). Two overlapping partial cDNAs corresponding to expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for human copine I were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (IMAGE Consortium clone identification numbers 51016 and 487481, corresponding to GenBankTM accession numbers H19014and AA043485, respectively). Sequencing of these cDNAs was completed, permitting the development of the following strategies for expression of full-length copine I and fragments of copine I. Numbering the coding sequence from 1 to 1613, oligonucleotides were synthesized to amplify copine I nucleotides 4–743 from clone AA043485, incorporating an XbaI site at the 5′-end and anXhoI site at the 3′-end: upstream primer, 5′-GCGCTCTAGAGGCCCACTGCGTGACCTTGG; downstream primer, 5′-CCAGCTCGAGCTACTTCTCAGGGTGGATGCATTG. Using this primer pair and ligating the PCR product into pGEX-KG (27Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) cut with XbaI and XhoI created an expression vector that would produce a fusion protein of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and most of the two C2 domains of copine I. To construct a vector to express the full-length copine, oligonucleotides were constructed to amplify copine I nucleotides 528–1613 from clone H19014. These primers incorporate the naturally occurring BglII site at nucleotide 528 and anXhoI site immediately following the termination codon: upstream, 5′-GTGTACAGATCTGAGGTCATCAAG; downstream, 5′-CCAGCTCGAGCTAGGCCTGGGGGGCCTGTGC. Using this primer pair and ligating the PCR product into the construct described above for the C2 domains cut with BglII andXhoI created an expression vector (pGEX-copine I) for full-length copine I fused to GST. To express the C-terminal half of copine I, comprising the A domain, a third upstream primer was designed corresponding to residues 759–783 and incorporating an XbaI site: upstream, 5′-GCGCTCTAGAAAGCTACAAGAACTCTGGAACTATCC. Using this primer and the primer corresponding to the C terminus of the protein, cDNA encoding the A domain was amplified from clone H19014and ligated into pGEX-KG cut with XbaI andXhoI. E. coli strain XL1 Blue (Stratagene) harboring pGEX-KG with the copine I A domain was induced to produce the GST-copine I A domain fusion protein as described (27Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar, 28Brownawell A.M. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22182-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Total bacterial cell homogenates were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After staining briefly with Coomassie Blue, approximately 500 μg of the GST-copine I A domain band of mass 55 kDa was excised, adjusted to pH 7.4 by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline, and then homogenized with Freund's complete adjuvant for immunization of rabbits. Booster injections were performed at 2 and 4 weeks using antigen similarly prepared and mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antiserum reacting with copine I was initially detected by Western blot after 4 weeks. Affinity-purified antibodies directed against the fusion protein or specifically against the copine I A domain were prepared by incubation of serum with the corresponding antigens immobilized on nitrocellulose (29Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antigens were purified after solubilization in sarcosyl as described by Frangioni and Neel (30Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). After removal of the sarcosyl, the antigens were insoluble and could not be eluted from the beads with glutathione. Cleavage with thrombin could be effected (27Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), but the copine A domain fragment was insoluble. Therefore, the antigen and bead complexes or SDS extracts of the beads were applied to SDS gels to further purify the antigens by electrophoresis. E. coli strain XL1 Blue (Stratagene) harboring pGEX-KG with full-length copine I was induced to produce the GST-copine I fusion protein. The fusion protein was extracted in sarcosyl (30Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and bound to glutathione-agarose beads. A portion of the fusion protein was eluted from the beads with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm glutathione. The eluate was clarified by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min. Less than 5% of the protein bound to the beads initially was obtained in the supernatant, suggesting poor solubility of the fusion protein or poor extraction with glutathione. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.3 by the addition of HCl and then incubated in 135-μl aliquots containing 100 ng of protein for 10 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 3.5 mm CaCl2 and approximately 250 μg of phosphatidylserine-enriched brain lipid vesicles (Sigma B-1502). After centrifugation at 6,000 ×g for 10 min, the pellets and supernatants were examined by Western blotting with the affinity-purified anti-copine I antibodies. Standard methods of molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology were as described in Ausubel et al. (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). For Southern blotting (see Fig. 5), hybridization was performed at 55 °C in Church buffer, and washes were at 55 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, followed by 0.2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Macronuclear DNA for Southern blot analysis was prepared as described (32Skouri F. Cohen J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed using the Sanger method on an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and Western blotting was performed according to Burnette (33Burnette W.N.

Protein was assayed by the Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The chromobindin fraction of adrenal medullary cytosol was prepared by affinity chromatography as described (35Creutz C.E. Dowling L.G. Sando J.J. Villar-Palasi C. Whipple J.H. Zaks W.J. J. Biol.

The single protein reacting with the antiserum (C) corresponds to chromobindin 17 (CB17). A weakly staining band is seen in the preimmune serum but is of higher mobility than the band reacting with the immune serum.

Migration positions of molecular weight standards are marked on the left with the corresponding masses in kDa. Note that the copine is partially pelleted in the presence of calcium alone and is completely pelleted in the presence of calcium and lipid together.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding proteins were isolated from the soluble fraction of homogenates of mass cultures of P. tetraurelia by binding to multilamellar vesicles prepared from brain lipid extracts enriched in phosphatidylserine. Fig. 1 shows an SDS gel of fractions obtained from a typical preparation. Lane Sis the postmicrosomal supernatant that was prepared in EGTA, representing all of the soluble proteins of the homogenate. Lane PC represents the supernatant remaining after adding lipid vesicles and 3 mm excess free calcium to the postmicrosomal supernatant and then sedimenting the vesicles by centrifugation. Note that this procedure does not cause a visible reduction in any of the bands in the postmicrosomal supernatant. Thus, none of the major proteins of the cytosol appear to bind lipids. The vesicles were then washed twice in high and low ionic strength buffers to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Lanes E1 and E2represent the proteins obtained by extracting the brain lipid vesicles with a buffer containing 10 mm EGTA to remove proteins that have bound to the lipids in a calcium-dependent manner. Only small amounts of protein are obtained. In a typical preparation, 70 mg of protein was present in the initial postmicrosomal supernatant, while the first extract from the lipid vesicles contained 360 μg of protein, and the second extract contained 200 μg. The major protein in the EGTA extracts from the lipid vesicles had an apparent mass of 55 kDa. Interestingly, the protein was obtained in greatest amount in the second EGTA extract. This is indicative of a very high sensitivity to calcium, since two washes in 10 mmEGTA were necessary to reduce the concentration of calcium sufficiently (10−7m or less) to remove the protein. The 55-kDa protein was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1, lane QFT) by passage over the fast protein liquid chromatography anion exchange medium Poros-Q, since it did not adhere to this resin, while other proteins in the extracts were retained. The typical yield of the purified protein was 50–70 μg, thus representing about 0.1% of the protein in the initial postmicrosomal supernatant. This purified 55-kDa protein is henceforth referred to as “copine,” as discussed in the Introduction. The small amounts of copine that could be obtained limited the degree of characterization possible. Emphasis was put on comparing the calcium and lipid specificities of copine in relation to those of the annexins and C2 domain-containing proteins. These specificities were tested in a centrifugation assay using multilamellar brain lipid vesicles. The purified copine was incubated with the vesicles under various conditions. The vesicles were then sedimented, and the supernatants and pellets were analyzed for copine by SDS gel electrophoresis. Fig. 2 illustrates an SDS gel of the supernatants from a typical binding experiment, and TableI summarizes the data from several binding experiments. It was found that calcium alone (i.e., in the absence of phospholipids) caused the copine to pellet at highg force (100,000 × g), implying that a calcium-dependent self-association of the protein was occurring. This self-association was calcium-specific, in that magnesium did not promote the pelleting of copine. At a lower centrifugal force, 12,000 × g, sufficient to sediment the lipid vesicles, copine was not pelleted unless phospholipids were present, suggesting the copine bound to the vesicles. The copine was evidently not destroyed, since it could be recovered from the pellets, as it was during the initial copine isolation procedure. The association with the lipid vesicles did not occur when magnesium was substituted for calcium (Fig. 2 and Table I) or when phosphatidylcholine vesicles were used instead of phosphatidylserine (Table I). All of these characteristics are typical of annexins or proteins that contain C2 domains.Table IBinding of Paramecium copine to lipids100,000 × g12,000 ×gNo lipidPSNo lipidPSPCEGTA−−−Ca (2 mm)++−+−Mg (2 mm)− Open table in a new tab It was also observed that under conditions where copine bound to the lipid vesicles, it exhibited a “bivalent” activity. The protein promoted the aggregation of the vesicles, which could be detected as an increase in the turbidity of the vesicle suspension (Fig.3). Purified copine was excised from a Coomassie-stained SDS gel, eluted, and subjected to hydrolysis with lysyl-endoprotease to generate peptides for direct sequencing. Six peptides isolated by HPLC were sequenced (TableII).

Types V and IIC sPLA2s were barely detectable in these cells. Studies using an anti-type IIA sPLA2 antibody, sPLA2 inhibitors, and a type IIA sPLA2-specific antisense oligonucleotide revealed that IL-1β/TNFα-induced delayed PGE2 generation by these cells was largely dependent on inducible type IIA sPLA2, which was functionally linked to inducible COX-2. Delayed PGE2 generation was also suppressed markedly by the cPLA2 inhibitor arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), which attenuated induction of type IIA sPLA2, but not COX-2, expression. AACOCF3inhibited the initial phase of cytokine-stimulated arachidonic acid release, and supplementing AACOCF3-treated cells with exogenous arachidonic acid partially restored type IIA sPLA2 expression. These results suggest that certain metabolites produced by the cPLA2-dependent pathway are crucial for the subsequent induction of type IIA sPLA2 expression and attendant delayed PGE2generation. Some lipoxygenase-derived products might be involved in this event, since IL-1β/TNFα-induced type IIA sPLA2induction and PGE2 generation were reduced markedly by lipoxygenase, but not COX, inhibitors. In contrast, Ca2+ionophore-stimulated immediate PGE2 generation was regulated predominantly by the constitutive enzymes cPLA2and COX-1, even when type IIA sPLA2 and COX-2 were maximally induced after IL-1β/TNFα treatment, revealing functional segregation of the constitutive and inducible PG biosynthetic enzymes.

Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Curr. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immediate phase of PG biosynthesis, occurring within several minutes of stimulation, is elicited by agonists that mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and characterized by a burst release of arachidonic acid initiated by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and subsequent conversion to bioactive PGs by the sequential actions of cyclooxygenase (COX) and terminal PG synthases. The delayed phase of PG biosynthesis is accompanied by the continuous supply of arachidonic acid and its conversion to PGs, often PGE2, over long culture periods following growth or proinflammatory stimuli. Segregated utilization of the two COX isoforms in these two distinct phases has been demonstrated in several systems (2Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Murakami M.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cells and tissues and is generally thought to serve certain physiologic housekeeping functions, whereas COX-2 is dramatically induced in response to a wide variety of stimuli, and is thought to contribute to the generation of PGs at certain stages of cell proliferation and differentiation and at sites of inflammation (5Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The absolute requirement for COX-2 in the delayed PG generation, irrespective of the constitutive presence of COX-1, has been shown by studies using COX-2-selective inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides, and knockout mice (2Murakami M.

In contrast, interleukin (IL)-1α-primed, platelet-derived growth factor-initiated immediate PGE2 generation by mouse calvaria cells depends on IL-1α-induced COX-2 in preference to constitutive COX-1 (8Chen Q.-R.

Several explanations of the functional segregation of the two COX isoforms have been proposed, such as their different subcellular localizations (9Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24019-24023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In fact, the finding that the utilization of arachidonic acid by COX-2 is favored over COX-1 at low peroxide concentrations (10Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24019-24023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) appears consistent with the involvement of COX-1 in the burst of events that follow immediate activation and of COX-2 in the delayed phase, in which only a limited amount of arachidonic acid would be supplied continuously. Moreover, preferential coupling between particular PLA2s, COXs, and terminal PG synthases have been suggested by several recent studies (11Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M. Fujishima H. Hunt J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall structures of types IIA, IIC, and V sPLA2s, the genes of which are tightly linked on human chromosome 1, are more closely related to one another than to that of type I sPLA2, the gene of which maps to human chromosome 12 (26Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). More recently, a novel group X sPLA2 has been cloned; it is distributed in immune tissues, exhibits some features characteristic of both types I and IIA sPLA2s, and maps to human chromosome 16 (27Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Matte M.-G. Ladzdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15145-15152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, the sPLA2 family is growing rapidly; therefore, it has been proposed that some of the previously described functions of sPLA2s, particularly type IIA sPLA2, need to be reevaluated, since studies based upon enzyme activities and using inhibitors or antibodies against type IIA sPLA2 may not discriminate these sPLA2s (26Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Here, we report the regulation of PGE2 biosynthesis in rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells, which have the capacity to express high levels of type IIA sPLA2, cPLA2 and the two COXs and to exhibit both immediate and delayed PGE2 generation in response to appropriate stimuli. Pharmacologic, immunochemical, and genetic studies have provided evidence that both cPLA2 and type IIA sPLA2 are required for COX-2-dependent delayed, whereas cPLA2, but not type IIA sPLA2, is utilized for COX-1-dependent immediate, PGE2biosynthesis by 3Y1 cells. Of particular interest is that functional cPLA2 may be crucial for the subsequent type IIA sPLA2 induction and attendant COX-2-dependent delayed PGE2 generation. Thus, this study (i) reconfirmed the involvement of type IIA sPLA2 in biological responses, (ii) demonstrated significant cross-talk between the two Ca2+-dependent PLA2s where one enzyme is required for the induction of the other, and (iii) revealed segregated coupling of discrete PLA2 and COX enzymes in the different phases of PG biosynthesis.

CellFectin reagent, Opti-MEM medium, and TRIzol reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. The IL-3-dependent mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell line MC-MKM, which originated from BALB/cJ mice (48Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was cultured in enriched medium supplemented with 50% (v/v) WEHI-3B-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3 and 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse c-kitligand, which had been expressed using a baculovirus system (2Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3Y1 cells were a gift from Dr. Y. Uehara (National Institute of Infectious Disease, Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in culture medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) (Flow Laboratories) and 2 mmglutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The media of 3Y1 cells that had attained 60–80% confluence in six-well plates (Iwaki) were replaced with 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS. After culture for 24 h, 1 ng/ml IL-1β, 100 units/ml human TNFα, or both were added to the cultures to assess the delayed response. Replicated cells were activated with 1 μm A23187 for 10 min in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS to assess the immediate response. The supernatants were taken for PGE2 enzyme immunoassay. For immunoblot analysis and the PLA2 assay (see below), the cells were trypsinized, washed once with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline), resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 250 mmsucrose at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and disrupted by 1-min pulse sonication (50% work cycle, setting 4) with a Branson Sonifier (Branson Sonic Power Co.). As for the RNA blot analysis, TRIzol was directly added to the cell monolayer. All the procedures were performed as described elsewhere (34Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts (10 μg) of total RNA, purified using TRIzol reagent, were applied to each lane of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then sequentially probed with cPLA2, type IIA sPLA2, COX-2, and β-actin cDNA probes that had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Life Science) by random priming (Takara Biomedicals). All hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C overnight in a solution comprising 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.75m NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 × Denhardt's solution (Sigma), 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). The membranes were washed three times at room temperature with 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, for 5 min each, followed by two washes at 55 °C with 30 mm NaCl, 3 mmsodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, for 15 min each. The blots were visualized by autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR films and double intensifying screens at −80 °C. The relative amount of each transcript was estimated by quantitating the associated radioactivity using a BAS-III bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film). The -fold increase in steady-state mRNA was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity associated with a specific transcript in treated cells compared with that in untreated cells and was corrected for changes in steady-state levels of β-actin transcript to adjust for differences in loading between lanes. Specific primers for the PCR, based on the sequences of sPLA2s reported previously (38Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol.

The type IIA sPLA2 primers used were 5′-ATG AAG GTC CTC CTC CTG CTA G-3′ and 5′-TCA GCA TTT GGG CTT CTT CC-3′ (45Murakami M. Kudo I. Natori Y. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1043: 34-42Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), type IIC sPLA2 primers were 5′-ATG GAC CTC CTG GTC TCC TCA GG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCA ATG AGT TTG TCC CTG C-3′ (41Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and type V sPLA2 primers were 5′-CAG GGG GCT TGC TAG AAC TCA A-3′ and 5′-AAG AGG GTT GTA AGT CCA GAG G-3′ (38Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RT-PCR was carried out using a RNA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus) version-2 (Takara Biomedicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 1 μg of total RNA from IL-1β/TNFα-treated 3Y1 or mast cells as a template. Equal amounts of each RT product were amplified by PCR withex Taq polymerase (Takara Biomedicals) for 30 cycles consisting of 30 s each at 94 °C, 55 °C and 72 °C. The amplified cDNA fragments were resolved electrophoretically on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide. The fragments were then transferred onto Immobilon-N membranes and probed with [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs for types IIA, IIC, and V sPLA2s. Hybridization and subsequent washing were carried out as described above for RNA blot analysis. All the procedures were performed as described previously (34Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing (for type IIA sPLA2) and reducing (for cPLA2, COX-1, and COX-2) conditions. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were washed once with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then blocked for 1 h in TBS-T containing 3% (w/v) skim milk. After washing the membranes with TBS-T, antibodies against cPLA2, type IIA sPLA2, COX-1, and COX-2 were added at a dilution of 1:5,000 in TBS-T and incubated for 2 h. Following three washes with TBS-T, the membranes were treated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; diluted 1:7,000) in TBS-T. After six washes with TBS-T, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Life Science). The PLA2 activities in the resulting lysates were measured after incubation with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Amersham Life Science) or 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (NEN Life Science Products), as the substrates, for 30 min at 37 °C (34Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The antisense (5′-TAG CAA CAG GAG GAC CTT CAT-3′) and sense (5′-ATG AAG GTC CTC CTG TTG CTA-3′) oligonucleotides for rat type IIA sPLA2, corresponding to the translation initiation site, 100 nm each, were incubated individually with CellFectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at room temperature and then added to cells that had attained 60–80% confluence in 6-well plates and been supplemented with 800 μl of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS in the continued presence of 100 nmoligonucleotide."

Based on analysis of the nuclear import kinetics mediated by the NLS of the human immunodeficiency virus accessory protein Tat usingin vivo and in vitro nuclear transport assays and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we report a novel nuclear import pathway. We demonstrate that the Tat-NLS, not recognized by importin 58/97 subunits as shown using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay, is sufficient to target the 476-kDa heterologous β-galactosidase protein to the nucleus in ATP-dependent but cytosolic factor-independent fashion. Excess SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag) NLS-containing peptide had no significant effect on the nuclear import kinetics implying that the Tat-NLS was able to confer nuclear accumulation through a pathway distinct from conventional NLS-dependent pathways. Nucleoplasmic accumulation of the Tat-NLS-β-galactosidase fusion protein, in contrast to that of a T-ag-NLS-containing fusion protein, also occurred in the absence of an intact nuclear envelope, implying that the Tat-NLS conferred binding to nuclear components. This is in stark contrast to known NLSs such as those of T-ag which confer nuclear entry rather than retention. Significantly, the ability to accumulate in the nucleus in the absence of an intact nuclear envelope was blocked in the absence of ATP, as well as by nonhydrolyzable ATP and GTP analogs, demonstrating that ATP is required to effect release from a complex with insoluble cytoplasmic components. Taken together, the results demonstrate that, dependent on ATP for release from cytoplasmic retention, the Tat-NLS is able to confer nuclear entry and binding to nuclear components.

While the conventional NLSs mentioned above appear to be recognized by importin/karyopherin and transported to the nucleus as outlined above, recent studies have revealed two novel nuclear protein import pathways which are mediated by quite distinct targeting signals and do not appear to involve the importin 58/97 complex (15Pollard V.W.

To gain insight into Tat targeting function as a possible paradigm of this class of viral targeting signal, this study examines the nuclear import kinetics of a β-galactosidase fusion protein carrying Tat amino acids 48–59 in vivo and in vitro at the single cell level, comparing results to those for fusion proteins carrying a classical NLS, that of T-ag (3Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). We find that the Tat-NLS, in contrast to the classical T-ag-NLS, confers nuclear accumulation through an import pathway which appears to require ATP but not cytosolic factors such as importin. Experiments using cells in which the nuclear envelope was permeabilized with CHAPS indicate that Tat fusion proteins can bind to both insoluble cytoplasmic and nuclear factors and that ATP is required to effect release from cytoplasmic retention and relocation to the nucleus. In contrast, the T-ag fusion protein binds neither cytosolic nor nuclear factors under the same conditions. We conclude that the Tat-NLS is able to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus through a novel import pathway. The detergent CHAPS was from Boehringer Mannheim and AMP-PNP from Calbiochem.

The resultant fusion protein comprises Tat amino acids 48–59 (GRKKRRQRRRAP59) fused amino-terminal to theEscherichia coli β-galactosidase enzyme sequence (amino acids 9–1023). The T-ag β-galactosidase fusion protein (T-ag-CcN-β-Gal) used in the comparative studies contains T-ag amino acids 111–135, including the CcN motif (comprising protein kinaseCK2 and cdk phosphorylation sites and theNLS) fused amino-terminal to β-galactosidase amino acids 9–1023 (28Jans D.A.

The predicted protein, designated OCRL, 1The abbreviations used are: OCRL, oculocerebrorenal syndrome; 5-phosphatase, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns 3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PtdIns 4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns 3,4-P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns 4,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Ins 1,4,5-P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins 1,3,4,5-P4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; GroPInsPn, glycerophosphorylinositols; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is comprised of 970 amino acids and is 51% identical to inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase type II (5-phosphatase II) over a span of 672 amino acids. The amino-terminal one-third has no homology to 5-phosphatase II or any other sequences in GenBank (3Attee O. Olivos-Glander I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The striking homology between OCRL and 5-phosphatase II suggested that OCRL belongs to the 5-phosphatase gene family and that Lowe syndrome represents an inborn error of inositol phosphate metabolism. Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5-phosphatases) are a group of enzymes containing 5-phosphatase homology domains, and two conserved signature motifs within these domains define proteins that have 5-phosphatase activity (for review, see Refs. 4Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Mitchell C.A. Brown S. Campbell J.K. Munday A.D. Speed C.J. Biochem. Soc.

The substrates of 5-phosphatases include two soluble inositol polyphosphates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins 1,3,4,5-P4), and two inositol lipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3). The 5-phosphatase isozymes have varying substrate specificities. Seven mammalian 5-phosphatases have been cloned and six of them have been characterized at the enzymatic level (4Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Mitchell C.A. Brown S. Campbell J.K. Munday A.D. Speed C.J. Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5983-5988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We previously characterized the OCRL protein by expressing a truncated version of recombinant OCRL encoding the entire region that is homologous to 5-phosphatase II, an enzyme that hydrolyzes all four of the substrates of 5-phosphatases (7Jefferson A.B.

Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Similarly to 5-phosphatase II, recombinant OCRL is also active toward all four of these substrates (7Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Pot D.A. Williams L.T. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5983-5988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, OCRL has a marked preference for PtdIns 4,5-P2compared with 5-phosphatase II suggesting that OCRL is mainly a PtdIns 4,5-P2 5-phosphatase (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This conclusion has been supported by a study using fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells from patients with Lowe syndrome, in which only PtdIns 4,5-P2hydrolyzing activity was detected to be lower in patient cells compared with normal cells (9Suchy S.F. Olivos-Glander I.M. Nussbaum R.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The properties of full-length OCRL have not been studied, and the function of the amino-terminal region of OCRL on enzyme activity is unknown. Analyses of Lowe syndrome patients have shown absence of mRNA or nonsense mutations or missense mutations that abolish the 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL suggesting that a loss of OCRL function is the cause of Lowe syndrome (3Attee O. Olivos-Glander I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 10Leahey A.M. Charnas L.R.

It is not clear why other 5-phosphatase isozymes fail to compensate for the deficiency of OCRL in patients with Lowe syndrome. It is possible that differing substrate preferences of 5-phosphatase isozymes or differences in tissue distribution or subcellular location account for the lack of compensation. We have now compared the activities of full-length and truncated OCRL encoding the region that is homologous to 5-phosphatase II. We find that they have similar activities using all four substrates, suggesting that the enzyme activity of OCRL protein is determined by its 5-phosphatase II homology region. We have used kidney proximal tubule cell lines from a patient with Lowe syndrome compared with control cell lines from a normal individual to study the expression of OCRL and other 5-phosphatases, phosphatidylinositol metabolism, and the subcellular localization of OCRL. We find that OCRL is absent in Lowe syndrome cells and is the major PtdIns 4,5-P2 hydrolyzing enzyme in normal kidney proximal tubule cell lines and that there is accumulation of PtdIns 4,5-P2 in the Lowe syndrome cells. We also find that OCRL is associated with lysosomes in control cells. [3H]Inositol, [3H]Ins1,3,4,5-P4, [3H]PtdIns 4,5-P2, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PtdIns was purchased from Avanti. PtdIns 4-P and PtdIns 4,5-P2 were from Boehringer Mannheim. [32P]Orthophosphate was from ICN, and32P-labeled Ins 1,4,5-P3 was prepared as described (12Connolly T.M.

Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were purchased from VWR. The Partisil 10 sax analytical column was from Whatman. The Mono S column was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Methylamine was from Fluka. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Plasmids containing full-length OCRL cDNA (ps.OCRL3) and a truncated OCRL cDNA (ps.OCRL4) lacking the amino-terminal region that is not homologous to 5-phosphatase II were generated using ps.OCRLB-1, a pBluescript SK vector containing the original OCRL1 cDNA in its BamHI and XbaI sites (3Attee O. Olivos-Glander I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We constructed ps.OCRL3 using a polymerase chain reaction with ps.OCRLB-1 as template. The sense primer included a BamHI site followed by OCRL1 nucleotides 245–268 (5′-CGGGATCCAGGATGGAGCCGCCGCTCCCGGTC-3′). This primer included the authentic ATG start codon at nucleotide 248 (in bold) and a single T to A substitution (in bold) at the −3 position to improve the Kozak sequence. The antisense polymerase chain reaction primer contained nucleotide 1530–1550 of OCRL1, where anSphI site is located (5′-CCTCATTGGCATCAGGCATGC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product obtained contains amino acids Met76 to Met506 of OCRL1. It was digested withBamHI/SphI and subcloned into the same region of ps.OCRLB-1 to replace amino acids 1–506 of the ps.OCRLB-1 cDNA. The resulting plasmid ps.OCRL3 was sequenced throughout the polymerase chain reaction region to exclude mutations (Sequenase 2.0, United States Biochemical Corp.). The ps.OCRL4 contains OCRL cDNA starting from Met264 of OCRL1 as described previously (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). TheBamHI/XbaI OCRL cDNA inserts of ps.OCRL3 and ps.OCRL4 were subsequently subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector pVL 1393 for expression in Sf9 cells. Human kidney proximal tubule cell lines from a patient with Lowe syndrome (LS) and from a normal individual (NHK) were established as described elsewhere (15Racusen L.C. Philip E. Graham A. Hartz P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 707Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Primaria dishes (Falcon) in NHK media containing 50% Ham's F12, 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm Hepes, 2.5 μg of insulin/ml, 0.05 μg of hydrocortisone/ml, 5 μg of transferrin/ml, 5 ng of sodium selenite/ml, 20 ng of triiodothyronine/ml, 50 units of penicillin/ml, 50 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 2.5 μg of amphotericin/ml. Sf9 cells were maintained at 27 °C in TNM-FH insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg of gentamicin/ml. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding full-length OCRL and a truncated OCRL lacking the amino-terminal region were produced in Sf9 cells following the manufacturer's instructions (PharMingen). Single plaques were isolated from the primary virus stock and amplified to a titer of 108 plaque-forming units/ml. For enzymatic studies of recombinant OCRL proteins, three flasks of 2 × 107 growing Sf9 cells were infected with 2 × 108 plaque-forming units of recombinant baculovirus expressing a protein tyrosine phosphatase MEG-01 that is used as a negative control, full-length OCRL, and truncated OCRL, respectively, as described (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Two days after infection, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold sonication buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 10 μg of pepstatin A/ml). Cells were disrupted by 2 × 10 s probe sonication at 200 watts on ice and then incubated on ice for 1 h to extract membrane-associated OCRL protein. The crude extracts were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for purification of OCRL protein. The column was eluted at 1 ml/min with buffer B (buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl) programmed as follows: 0–2 min, buffer A; 2–32 min, 0–100% buffer B. The peak OCRL fractions were identified by assaying for Ins 1,4,5-P35-phosphatase activity and by Western blotting using anti-OCRL antibody. The equivalent fractions obtained from extracts of cells infected with MEG-01 were used as blanks in 5-phosphatase assays. The same numbers of NHK and LS cells were each seeded in five p100 Primaria dishes and allowed to grow to 90% confluency. The cells were harvested in PBS, resuspended, and extracted as described above. The protein concentration of the extracts was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The same amount of total protein (3 mg) from NHK and LS cell extracts was diluted to 10 ml immediately before loading onto a 1-ml Mono S column equilibrated with buffer A. The cell extracts were then fractionated by eluting the column at 1 ml/min with buffer B (buffer A containing 1 mNaCl) programmed as follows: 0–10 min, buffer A (flow-through); 10–30 min, 0–50% B; 30–35 min, 50–100% B. A total of 26 fractions were collected including 1 10-ml flow-through and 25 1-ml eluate fractions. Assays of 5-phosphatase activity using [32P]Ins 1,4,5-P3, [3H]Ins 1,3,4,5-P4, and [3H]PtdIns 4,5-P2 were as described (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 assay, TLC-purified PtdIns [32P]3,4,5-P3 was prepared as described (16Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 5-phosphatase activity was assayed in 25 μl containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 800–1000 cpm PtdIns [32P]3,4,5-P3, 2.5 μg of phosphatidylserine, and various amounts of enzyme. The reactions were performed at 37 °C for times ranging from 10 to 60 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 80 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1), and the lipid products were extracted by vortexing and separated as described (16Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products of reactions were detected by autoradiography. The spots on the TLC plates corresponding to products and unhydrolyzed substrates were scraped into vials and counted using Cerenkov radioactivity in a Beckman scintillation counter. The 5-phosphatase activity was expressed as the percentage of PtdIns [32P]3,4-P2 formed from the total PtdIns [32P]3,4,5-P3 in the assay. NHK and LS cells (1 × 106 of each cell type) were plated in p100 Primaria dishes, allowed to attach for 24 h, and labeled with 10 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol/ml in inositol-free NHK media containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown in labeling media for 3 days until confluent. The labeled cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and scraped into glass test tubes with 3 ml of methanol: 0.5 n HCl (2:1), extracted with the addition of 1 ml of chloroform followed by vortexing. Phases were separated by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform, 0.5 n HCl (1:1). The organic phase containing total cellular lipids was washed with 2 × 5 ml of 2 m KCl and dried under N2 for further analysis. For analysis of phosphoinositides, the dried lipids were deacylated by treatment with methylamine reagent at 53 °C for 50 min as described previously (18Cunningham T.W. Lips D.L. Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K. Mitchell C.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21676-21683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GroPtdIns products of deacylation were mixed with GroPtdIns [32P]3-P, GroPtdIns [32P]3,4-P2, and GroPtdIns [32P]3,4,5-P3 as internal standards (17Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J.

Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The 1-ml fractions of eluate from HPLC columns were counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. The total phospholipid in each sample was determined by measuring organic phosphate (20Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit anti-OCRL antibody was made against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated carboxyl-terminal peptide of OCRL as described (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The antibody was purified using an affinity column containing Affi-Gel 15 gel matrix (Bio-Rad) cross-linked with bovine serum albumin-conjugated OCRL carboxyl-terminal peptide. NHK and LS cells were grown in two-well chamber slides. Cells containing sucrosomes were generated as described (21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin/PBS, and incubated with the affinity purified anti-OCRL polyclonal antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For double immunofluorescence, the cells were incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies including anti-OCRL polyclonal antibody and anti-γ-adaptin monoclonal antibody, or anti-OCRL polyclonal antibody and anti-protein disulfate isomerase monoclonal antibody, or anti-OCRL polyclonal antibody and anti-lamp1 monoclonal antibody, respectively. This first incubation was followed by a second incubation with a mixture of secondary antibodies including fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were observed using a Nikon microscope system (ECLIPSE E800). We have previously characterized a 90-kDa amino-terminal truncated OCRL protein that encodes the entire domain homologous to 5-phosphatase II (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We showed that the 90-kDa OCRL is a 5-phosphatase with a substrate preference for PtdIns 4,5-P2. We now compare full-length OCRL to the truncated OCRL protein. We expressed full-length OCRL, the 90-kDa truncated OCRL, and a protein tyrosine phosphatase MEG-01 as a negative control (7Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Pot D.A. Williams L.T. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5983-5988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) in Sf9 cells followed by a one-step purification procedure using a Mono S column. Peak fractions containing OCRL and the corresponding fraction from MEG-01 extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). OCRL was purified to near homogeneity in one step due to the high level of OCRL in Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 A). Full-length OCRL migrated as a 105-kDa protein as shown in Fig. 1 A, lane 1, whereas the truncated protein migrated at 90 kDa. We compared full-length OCRL to truncated OCRL using all four 5-phosphatase substrates (Fig. 1,B–D). Full-length OCRL hydrolyzed Ins 1,4,5-P3 with a K m of 123 ± 13 μm and Ins 1,3,4,5-P4 with aK m of 28 ± 9 μm (data not shown). Truncated OCRL hydrolyzed Ins 1,4,5-P3 with aK m of 145 ± 31 μm and Ins 1,3,4,5-P4 with a K m of 25 ± 8 μm (data not shown). These values are similar to those reported previously (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The activities of purified full-length and truncated OCRL proteins using Ins 1,4,5-P3, Ins 1,3,4,5-P4, and PtdIns 4,5-P2 were less than those reported previously using the 90-kDa OCRL in crude Sf9 cell extracts (8Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This parallel reduction of enzyme activity using all the substrates could result from the loss of activity after purification. We find that full-length OCRL has 5-phosphatase activity that is similar to and has the same substrate preference as truncated OCRL. It appears that the 5-phosphatase II homology region of OCRL determines its enzyme activity, whereas the amino-terminal region of OCRL is not required for its enzyme activity. A Western blot of the total cell extract from two NHK cell lines and three LS cell lines using a rabbit anti-OCRL carboxyl-terminal peptide antiserum is shown in Fig.2. OCRL protein was absent in the LS cell extracts, whereas native OCRL protein was detected in NHK cells and appears to be the same size as recombinant full-length OCRL (Fig. 2). The same Western blot was also probed with a rabbit anti-OCRL amino-terminal peptide antiserum and a rabbit anti-full-length OCRL antiserum, but neither detected immunoreactive OCRL protein in extracts from LS cells (data not shown). The absence of OCRL protein indicates that this Lowe syndrome patient has a loss of function mutation like other Lowe syndrome patients reported (3Attee O. Olivos-Glander I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C.

Genet. 1997; 60: 1384-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We tested whether other 5-phosphatases are present in these cells. Western blots of the total cell extracts from two NHK cell lines and two LS cell lines using different 5-phosphatase antibodies are shown in Fig. 3. 5-Phosphatase I, 5-phosphatase II, and SHIP 5-phosphatase representing groups I, II, and III 5-phosphatases, respectively, were all present in NHK and LS cells. OCRL is only present in the NHK cells (Fig. 3). The existence of multiple 5-phosphatases in these cells indicates that the renal defect in Lowe syndrome is not due to an absense of 5-phosphatase enzyme per se and suggests that OCRL has a specific function that is not provided by the other 5-phosphatases. We next investigated the substrate specificity of native OCRL protein in these cells. We fractionated equal amounts of extract from NHK and LS cells using a Mono S column to separate OCRL from other 5-phosphatases as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We analyzed 0.3% (v/v) of the flow-through and 3% (v/v) of column fractions by Western blotting with different 5-phosphatase antibodies. Fractions 1–7 and 18–25 contained no detectable OCRL protein (data not shown). Fractions containing immunoreactive OCRL and other 5-phosphatases (fractions 7–18) are shown in Fig.4. SHIP 5-phosphatase was found in the flow-through and fractions 10–13 in both the NHK and LS cells (Fig.4 A). The 5-phosphatase I was also found in the flow-through and in fractions 7–13 in the LS cells and fractions 7–18 in the NHK cells (Fig. 4 C). The 5-phosphatase II did not bind to Mono S and was found in the flow-through of both NHK and LS cells (data not shown). OCRL in NHK cells was not detected in the flow-through. The peak immunoreactivity was found in fractions 7, 8, 15, and 16 (Fig.4 B). That two peaks of OCRL were eluted from the column suggests that two forms of OCRL are present in these cells. We also observed a truncated form of OCRL in NHK cells in fractions 7–11 (Fig.4 B). This truncated OCRL was cleaved from its amino terminus since it was not detected with an anti-OCRL amino-terminal peptide antibody (data not shown). We did not detect any precursor-product relationship of the truncated OCRL by pulse-chase labeling of NHK cells (data not shown), suggesting that the truncated forms of OCRL were an artifact of in vitro proteolysis. We then assayed the Mono S column fractions for the ability to hydrolyze all four 5-phosphatase substrates (Fig.5). The Ins 1,4,5-P35-phosphatase activity was found mainly in the flow-through fraction, corresponding to 5-phosphatases I and II that are present in NHK and LS cells (Fig. 5 A). There was also activity in fractions 9–13, the region where 5-phosphatase I eluted from both the cell lines (Fig.5 A). The total Ins 1,4,5-P3-hydrolyzing activity in NHK cells is 1.7-fold higher than that in LS cells. This reduced activity in LS cells is possibly due to the lack of OCRL. However, the majority of Ins 1,4,5-P3 hydrolyzing activity in these cells is not contributed by OCRL. The majority of Ins 1,3,4,5-P4 5-phosphatase activi"

The extreme C termini of alternatively spliced “b”-type Ca2+ pump isoforms resemble those of K+ channels andN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits that interact with channel-clustering proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family via PDZ domains. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated strong interaction of Ca2+ pump 4b with the PDZ1+2 domains of several mammalian MAGUKs. Pump 4b and PSD-95 could be co-immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells overexpressing these proteins. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that a C-terminal pump 4b peptide interacted with the PDZ1+2 domains of hDlg with nanomolar affinity (K D = 1.6 nm), whereas binding to PDZ3 was in the micromolar range (K D = 1.2 μm). In contrast, the corresponding C-terminal peptide of Ca2+ pump 2b interacted weakly with PDZ1+2 and not at all with PDZ3 of hDlg. Ca2+ pump 4b bound strongly to PDZ1+2+3 of hDlg on filter assays, whereas isoform 2b bound weakly, and the splice variants 2a and 4a failed to bind. Together, these data demonstrate a direct physical binding of Ca2+ pump isoform 4b to MAGUKs via their PDZ domains and reveal a novel role of alternative splicing within the family of plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps. Alternative splicing may dictate their specific interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins, potentially influencing their localization and incorporation into functional multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane.

Mammalian PMCAs are encoded by a multigene family consisting of four members termed PMCA 1–4 (3Strehler E.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).

J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and in several cell types, the PMCA has been shown to be concentrated in specific membrane domains by immunocytochemical analyses. For example, in kidney and intestinal epithelia involved in transcellular Ca2+ flux, the pump is generally localized to the basolateral membrane (18Borke J.L. Minami J. Verma A. Penniston J.T. Kumar R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1225-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using immunoelectron microscopy, the PMCA was recently detected at the plasma membrane surrounding the soma, as well as in the dendrites and spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells where it co-localized with P-type Ca2+ channels (19Hillman D.E. Chen S. Bing R. Penniston J.T. Llinas R. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that different isoforms of the PMCA may play an active role in the local control of Ca2+signaling and the dynamic regulation of Ca2+ microdomains (7Monteith G.R. Roufogalis B.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which PMCA isoforms are localized to specific regions of the plasma membrane are unknown. Recent studies have shown that several membrane receptors and channels are clustered into multiprotein complexes linked to the cytoskeleton via interactions of their C-terminal cytosolic tails with a novel protein interaction module called the PDZ domain (21Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Sheng M. Kim E. Curr. Opin.

Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). They are also present in the Drosophila discs-large (Dlg) tumor suppressor protein and the zona occludens ZO-1 tight junctional protein (hence the name PDZ) and have since been demonstrated in a large variety of multifunctional proteins (21Sheng M.

Several of these PDZ domain-containing proteins, including PSD-95, Chapsyn-110, and hDlg (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A short, consensus C-terminal sequence motif (-E(T/S)XV*, where * represents the stop codon) has been shown to be critical for the interaction between membrane proteins (such as Shaker-type K+ channels and NMDA receptor NR2 subunits) and the PDZ domains present in the PSD-95 family of MAGUKs (24Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). In the PMCAs, the C-terminal sequence of all “b” type alternative splice variants contains the consensus -ETSL* or -ETSV* which is similar to the -E(T/S)XV* motif found in Shaker K+ channel and NR2 NMDA receptor proteins. Human PMCA1b, -2b, and -3b end with the sequence -ETSL*, whereas hPMCA4b ends with the sequence -ETSV* (3Strehler E.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we reasoned that the intracellular C-terminal tail of hPMCA4b may interact with MAGUKs via their PDZ domains. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the interaction of hPMCA4b with the PDZ domains of several MAGUKs using a variety of binding assays. The results documented in this paper provide the first evidence of direct binding of the PMCA4b isoform to MAGUKs and suggest a novel mechanism by which alternative splicing generates Ca2+ pump isoforms that may be differentially recruited to multifunctional protein complexes involved in Ca2+regulation. A cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 71 residues (amino acids 1135 to 1205) of hPMCA4b was cloned into pBHA (LexA fusion vector) and used in yeast two-hybrid assays with various PDZ domain constructs made in pGAD10 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The pGAD10 constructs encoding each individual PDZ domain, or PDZ1+2 of PSD-95 fused to the GAL4 activation domain have been described (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), as has the construct encoding all three PDZ domains of hDlg (clone 4 (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar)). pGAD10 plasmids carrying the corresponding domains of rat Chapsyn-110 (30Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M.

Constructs expressing the C-terminal sequences of hPMCA2a (aa 1126–1168), -2b (aa 1141–1212), -4a (aa 1115–1170), and -4b (aa 1135–1205) as GST fusion proteins with a protein kinase A phosphorylation site were made by PCR amplification of the appropriate cDNA fragments and subcloning them in-frame into pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia). The mammalian expression vectors for full-length hPMCA4b and PSD-95 have been described (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

Peptides CT2b and CT4b corresponding to the C-terminal 10 residues of hPMCA2b (SPIHSLETSL) and hPMCA4b (SSLQSLETSV), respectively, were chemically synthesized in the Mayo Clinic Core Facility and were N-terminally coupled to biotin via a spacer sequence SGSG. The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and their purity was assessed by mass spectrometry. The PDZ1+2 and PDZ3 domains of hDlg and the C-terminal domains of PMCAs were expressed in E. coli as recombinant GST fusion proteins and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). Purified proteins were dialyzed against HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20). The His-tagged hDlg PDZ1+2+3 protein was expressed in E. coli BL-21(DE3) and purified by metal chelate chromatography using a Poros MC20 column (Boehringer Mannheim). Two-hybrid interaction assays were performed as described (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) using yeast strain L40 harboringHIS3 and β-Gal reporter genes under the control of LexA binding sites. Semiquantitative analysis based on the degree of reporter gene activation was carried out as described (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin were transfected at 50% confluence by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (39Kim E.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were extracted in a 50-fold volume of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with affinity-purified primary antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose, separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by immunoblotting. A polyclonal guinea pig antibody against PSD-95 (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) and a monoclonal mouse antibody (JA3) against hPMCA4b (17Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitations at 1 μg/ml and 1:1000 dilution, respectively. Aliquots of purified His-tagged hDlg-PDZ1+2+3 protein (1 μg each) were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using standard Western blotting techniques (41$$Google Scholar). GST-PMCA fusion proteins and GST alone (control) were expressed in E. coli JM101 from the appropriate pGEX-2TK vector and were phosphorylated while bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads using bovine heart muscle protein kinase A (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) (42Fischer R. Wei Y. Berchtold M. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The labeled fusion proteins were eluted from the washed beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) and were used to probe the nitrocellulose membranes essentially as described (42Fischer R. Wei Y. Berchtold M. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The interaction between the PDZ domains of hDlg and the C-terminal peptides of hPMCA2b and -4b was studied by surface plasmon resonance measurements using a BIAcore instrument (Biacore, Inc.) as described (36Marfatia S.M. Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 204 and 390 resonance units (RU), respectively, of biotinylated peptides CT2b and CT4b were captured on the streptavidin surface of a SA sensor chip (research grade). The purified recombinant proteins GST, GST-PDZ1+2, and GST-PDZ3 were exposed to the immobilized peptides at a concentration of 410 μg/ml. To quantify the affinity of the interaction of CT4b with PDZ1+2 of hDlg, 82 RU of peptide CT4b were immobilized on the SA sensor chip surface and increasing concentrations of GST-PDZ1+2 (ranging from 12.4 nm to 978 nm) were passed over the immobilized peptide surface. To quantify the interaction of CT4b with PDZ3 of hDlg, 394 RU of CT4b were captured on the surface of a SA sensor chip, and the immobilized peptide was exposed to increasing concentrations of GST-PDZ3 (0.83 μmto 65.2 μm). The b splice forms of the human PMCAs terminate in the conserved sequence -S(L/V)ETS(L/V)* that matches the minimal -(T/S)XV* consensus motif for PDZ domain interaction (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 33Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). The sequence -ETSV* of hPMCA4b matches the consensus precisely whereas that of all other PMCA b splice forms (-ETSL*) deviates conservatively from the consensus at the last residue. To test if hPMCA4b can interact with PDZ domains of known channel/receptor clustering molecules, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays using the C-terminal 71 residues of PMCA4b fused to the LexA DNA binding domain as “bait,” and various PDZ domains fused to the GAL4 activating domain as potential partners. The interaction was assayed semiquantitatively based on the degree ofHIS3 and β-Gal reporter gene induction (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that no reporter gene activity was detected when the control plasmid pGAD10 was transformed into yeast expressing the LexA-PMCA4b fusion protein from the pBHA-PMCA bait construct. By contrast, both reporter genes were activated when the transformation was performed with the PDZ domain-expressing constructs. A very strong induction was observed when the combined PDZ1+2 domains of either PSD-95 or Chapsyn-110 or all three PDZ domains of hDlg were expressed together with the PMCA4b fusion protein (Fig. 1). As has been shown for the Kv1.4 potassium channel (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) and the NR2 subunits of NMDA receptors (33Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 43Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), interaction of the PMCA4b C-terminal sequence was strongest with the individual PDZ domain 2 of the MAGUKs tested. However, an interaction with the PDZ1 and PDZ3 domains was also observed (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that a weak but significant interaction was observed of the hPMCA4b with the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95 and Chapsyn-110. This is in contrast to the Kv1.4 potassium channel that showed no affinity for PDZ3 even in the sensitive two-hybrid assay (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the PDZ3 domain of hDlg alone and of PSD-95 complexed with a peptide ligand ending in the sequence -QTSV* were recently reported (34Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 37Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), rationalizing the importance of the C-terminal Val and of the Thr residue at position −2. Because the extreme C termini of hPMCA4b (which can bind to PDZ3) and of Kv1.4 (which does not bind to PDZ3) differ only at position −1 (Ser in the PMCA, Asp in the Kv1.4), it is likely that the residue at this position (and/or additional more N-terminally located residues) also play a role in determining the binding affinity of a C-terminal peptide to the PDZ3 domain. To determine if hPMCA4b can interact with a PDZ domain protein when both are expressed as full-length proteins in a mammalian cell, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for hPMCA4b and PSD-95. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using either a polyclonal antibody against PSD-95 or a monoclonal antibody against PMCA4b. Both proteins were abundantly expressed upon transient transfection of COS-7 cells with the appropriate vectors (Fig.2, lanes 1–3). PSD-95 and PMCA4b were effectively co-immunoprecipitated in reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments using cells that had been co-transfected with the two expression plasmids (Fig. 2, lanes 4–7). Neither of the two antibodies showed nonspecific cross-reactivity with the partner protein as demonstrated by the inability of anti-PSD-95 to precipitate the PMCA from cells transfected with PMCA alone (Fig. 2, lane 5) and the inability of anti-PMCA4b to precipitate significant amounts of PSD-95 from cells expressing only PSD-95 (Fig. 2, lane 7, compare withlane 2). The small amount of PSD-95 immunoprecipitated by the anti-PMCA4b antibody from cells expressing PSD-95 (Fig. 2,lane 7) could be due to the presence of endogenously expressed PMCA4b in the COS-7 cells. However, under our immunoblotting conditions the endogenous PMCA4b remained below the detection limit (see Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 7). These data, therefore, show that full-length PMCA4b can interact with full-length PSD-95 in a cellular environment. Based on the yeast two-hybrid analysis, this interaction is likely mediated by binding of the C-terminal sequence of the pump to a PDZ domain (probably PDZ2) of its partner PDZ domain-containing protein (PSD-95/Chapsyn-110/hDlg). To quantify the interaction of the PMCA4b C terminus with the PDZ domains and to determine comparative values for a possible interaction of other PMCA b splice forms with the same PDZ domains, we performed surface plasmon resonance measurements using synthetic PMCA peptides and purified GST fusion proteins of the various PDZ domains of hDlg. When recombinant GST, GST-PDZ1+2, and GST-PDZ3 were exposed to the immobilized peptide CT4b (corresponding to the C-terminal 10 residues of hPMCA4b), both GST-PDZ1+2 and GST-PDZ3 fusion proteins bound to the peptide (Fig. 3 A) whereas no binding was observed with GST alone. Interestingly, when the same experiment was performed with immobilized peptide CT2b (corresponding to the C-terminal 10 residues of hPMCA2b), binding was only evident to GST-PDZ1+2. No binding was observed with either GST-PDZ3 or GST alone (Fig. 3 B). The affinity of the interaction of CT4b with the combined PDZ1+2 domains of hDlg was quantified by passing increasing concentrations of GST-PDZ1+2 fusion protein over the CT4b peptide surface (Fig. 3 C). Analysis of the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams yielded an overall dissociation constant, K D, of 1.64 nm(k a = 1.16 × 106m−1 s−1 and k d = 1.9 × 10−3 s−1), indicative of a high affinity interaction between CT4b and the combined PDZ1+2 domains of hDlg. The interaction between CT4b and PDZ3 of hDlg was similarly analyzed. A K D of 1.22 μm was calculated from the association (k a = 3.59 × 103m−1 s−1) and dissociation (k d = 4.38 × 10−3s−1) rate constants (Fig. 3 D), indicating a relatively low affinity interaction between CT4b and the PDZ3 domain of hDlg. These results fully agree with the two-hybrid interaction data. The binding affinities measured for PDZ domains of hDlg should be broadly extrapolatable to PSD-95 and Chapsyn-110, since the equivalent PDZ domains of these closely related proteins are highly conserved and no differences in binding specificity between the different proteins have been detected to date (29Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar,43Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2E. Kim and M. Sheng, unpublished observations. Quantification of the interaction between peptide CT2b and PDZ1+2 of hDlg was not attempted due to the relatively low affinity of the interaction (compare Fig. 3,A and B) as well as technical difficulties in capturing sufficient amounts of the CT2b peptide on the biosensor chip surface. Independent confirmation of the specificity of the interaction of hPMCA4b with the PDZ domains of hDlg was obtained using a filter assay. Immobilized recombinant His-tagged hDlg-PDZ1+2+3 fusion protein was probed with radiolabeled GST alone or with various GST-PMCA C-terminal fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, GST-hPMCA4b bound strongly to the hDlg-PDZ1+2+3 fusion protein, whereas GST-hPMCA2b bound weakly and GST-hPMCA2a, GST-hPMCA4a and GST alone did not bind at all. These findings agree with the BIAcore measurements showing a much reduced affinity of hPMCA2b for the PDZ1+2 domains of hDlg. Importantly, the results also show that none of the alternatively spliced “a” forms of the PMCA are able to bind the PDZ domains and thus suggest a novel mechanism whereby alternatively spliced forms of the Ca2+ pumps are distinguished by their interaction with PDZ domain-containing target proteins. The nanomolar affinity of hPMCA4b for the PDZ1+2 domains of hDlg suggests that hPMCA4b and hDlg may be binding partners in vivo where they are co-expressed in kidney and intestinal epithelial cells (17Caride A.J.

An in vivo interaction between PMCA4b and other members of the PSD-95 family of MAGUKs may be equally plausible: PSD-95 and Chapsyn-110 have been found pre- and postsynaptically in several areas of the brain that also express PMCA4b (15Zacharias D.A. Dalrymple S.J. Strehler E.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 28: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M.

The large difference in binding affinity of the C termini of hPMCA4b and hPMCA2b to the PDZ1+2 domains of the PSD-95/Chapsyn-110/hDlg members of the MAGUK family underscores the importance of the carboxyl-terminal residue (Val in hPMCA4b, Leu in the other hPMCA b-splice forms) in determining the specificity of this interaction. This observation is consistent with the recently demonstrated target specificity of PDZ domains using an oriented peptide library approach (35Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar).

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) also suggest that other PMCA isoforms of the b splice type, such as PMCA2b, may recognize novel PDZ domain-containing proteins. An interaction of Ca2+ pump isoforms with specific PDZ domain proteins may be relevant for the local organization of Ca2+ signaling domains at the plasma membrane and/or for anchoring Ca2+ regulatory complexes to the cytoskeleton. It is probably not coincidental that the Ca2+ pump 4b can interact with the same clustering proteins (PSD-95, Chapsyn-110) as NMDA receptors. The ability of PSD-95 MAGUKs to homo- and heteromultimerize allows them to cocluster several different ligands (40Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) thus allowing for co-aggregation of Ca2+ pump and NMDA receptor proteins in the same membrane microdomain. The local concentration of Ca2+ pump (e.g. in dendritic spines) would facilitate the extrusion of calcium ions admitted into the dendritic spine through activated NMDA receptors, thereby restricting the duration of the Ca2+ signal. The functional significance of these interactions is currently under investigation. We thank E. Brittle for help with plasmid construction and fusion protein expression, A. Caride, A. G.

https://openalex.org/W2049604444,"HAH1 is a 68-amino acid protein originally identified as a human homologue of Atx1p, a multi-copy suppressor of oxidative injury in sod1Δ yeast. Molecular modeling of HAH1 predicts a protein structure of two α-helices overlaying a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with a potential metal binding site involving two conserved cysteine residues. Consistent with this model, in vitro studies with recombinant HAH1 directly demonstrated binding of Cu(I), and site-directed mutagenesis identified these cysteine residues as copper ligands. Expression of wild type and mutant HAH1 in atx1Δ yeast revealed the essential role of these cysteine residues in copper trafficking to the secretory compartment in vivo, as expression of a Cys-12/Cys-15 double mutant abrogated copper incorporation into the multicopper oxidase Fet3p. In contrast, mutation of the highly conserved lysine residues in the carboxyl terminus of HAH1 had no effect on copper trafficking to the secretory pathway but eliminated the antioxidant function of HAH1 in sod1Δ yeast. Taken together, these data support the concept of a unique copper coordination environment in HAH1 that permits this protein to function as an intracellular copper chaperone mediating distinct biological processes in eucaryotic cells.

Copper is an essential trace element in all living organisms. As a cofactor in enzymatic catalysis, this metal plays a key role in the biochemistry of cellular respiration, antioxidant defense, and iron metabolism in eucaryotes (1Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Excess or free intracellular copper is highly toxic; thus, specialized systems have evolved for the transport of this metal inside the cell. Insight into the mechanisms of intracellular copper trafficking has come from characterization of the genes involved in the inherited copper disorders, Wilson and Menkes disease (2Vulpe C.

Studies on a homologous ATPase, Ccc2p, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed a remarkable evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of cellular copper metabolism (13Yuan D.S. Stearman R.

Although less is known about the mechanisms of cytoplasmic copper trafficking, recent studies have identified a soluble factor in yeast, Atx1p as well as a human homologue, HAH1, that functions in antioxidant defense and the delivery of copper to the transport ATPases (14Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 15Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Together with studies identifying specific proteins responsible for the delivery of copper to cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria (17Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the delivery of copper to specific intracellular enzymes is mediated by distinct copper transport proteins in the cell. The amino terminus of HAH1 contains a putative copper binding motif, MXCXXC, that is repeated 6-fold in the Menkes and Wilson ATPases. This finding suggests that HAH1 is a copper-binding protein, and the current study was undertaken to directly examine this possibility and to determine the amino acid residues responsible for metal binding, copper trafficking to the secretory pathway, and antioxidant defense. Protein sequence data banks were searched using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) network server at the National Center for Biotechnology Information with default parameterization (19Altschul S. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70338) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic cluster analysis was used for pairwise and multiple alignments as well as for secondary structure prediction (20Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Manual editing of multiple alignments and profile data base screenings were performed utilizing the software package GCG 7.0 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). To measure the compatibility of the aligned sequences with a known three-dimensional structure, manual refinement of multiple sequence alignments was optimized as described (21Bryant S.H. Lawrence C.E. Proteins. 1993; 16: 92-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Structural models were then built using the known coordinates of the related folds and the refined coordinates of the NMR structure of MerP (22Steele R.A. Opella S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional visualization was performed on a UNIX workstation using the XmMol program (23Tuffery P. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The coding region of the HAH1gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction utilizing oligonucleotides designed to introduce a 5′ NdeI and a 3′EcoRI restriction site. The amplified product was ligated into the pET 28a(+) expression vector (Novagen) and used to transformEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of HAH1 cDNA was performed using Klentaq polymerase (CLONTECH) and the ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (11Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In all cases, the fidelity of the cDNA sequence as well as the presence of the intended mutations was confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). Transformed bacteria were grown to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9. After the addition of lysozyme, the bacterial cell suspension was disrupted by sonication at 4 °C, and DNase I was added. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman Ti70 rotor at 4 °C for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto a previously charged and equilibrated Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Novagen). Wild type or mutant HAH1 proteins were cleaved from the column with thrombin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. The purified recombinant proteins were concentrated and collected using Centriplus (Amicon). Oxidized wild type apoprotein was prepared for NMR spectroscopy by dissolving in 90% 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10% D20 (v/v). Nuclear Overhauser effect dipolar-correlated two-dimensional spectra (NOESY) and total correlation spectroscopy spectra were obtained at 298 K using a Varian 500 spectrometer. For mass analysis, wild type HAH1 was dialyzed in 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. Dithiothreitol was added to the buffer during dialysis to obtain the reduced form of HAH1. Oxidized and reduced apoprotein samples were subsequently lyophilized, and mass analysis was performed using a Finnigan (Thermoquest Corp., San Jose, CA) LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a standard electrospray source. Before spraying into the mass spectrometer, all protein samples were desalted on a Michron BioResources Ultrafast Microprotein analyzer (Auburn, CA) using a 1.0 × 150-mm reverse phase C-18 column. The trifluoroacetic acid content was subsequently reduced to 0.02% (v/v) to prevent suppression of ionization in electrospray mass spectrometry. The eluent was infused directly into the LCQ source. To examine cobalt binding, the recombinant HAH1 proteins were reduced in 0.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. CoCl2 was added dropwise to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The anaerobic reconstitution of HAH1 with cobalt was performed under argon after elimination of the reducing agent by a 10-fold dilution in the Tris buffer. After cobalt addition, an equal volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 9.0 was added to the reconstituted protein solution, which was then centrifuged for 2 h in a Centricon-3 filter (Amicon). The proteins were then analyzed by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic wavelength scanning utilizing the eluent as a blank. To examine copper binding, recombinant HAH1 proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol for 2 h before the addition of 62.5 pmol of64Cu (35 mCi/μg of Cu) at 4 °C. After a 2-h incubation, the protein solutions were chromatographed by size exclusion on Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) columns previously equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. Individual fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was analyzed in a 3-inch NaI crystal using a Packard γ counter. Aliquots were taken for the determination of protein content by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). For sulfhydryl group analysis, HAH1 proteins were incubated with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and the production ofp-nitrothiobenzyl anion was monitored spectroscopically at 412 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 cm−1(27Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione were used as positive and negative controls.

Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and uracil base selection was used to screen for transformants (31Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Preparation of membrane extracts and analysis of 64Cu incorporation into newly synthesized Fet3p were as described previously (16Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.-J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C.

Polyclonal rabbit antisera to recombinant HAH1 was prepared after expression, thrombin cleavage, and purification of a glutathioneS-transferase HAH1 fusion protein and will be described in detail elsewhere. 1M. Schaefer, L. Klomp, and J. Gitlin, unpublished data. To develop a molecular model of HAH1, the amino acid sequence of this protein was aligned with several previously identified homologous sequences. Secondary structure prediction of these sequences using hydrophobic cluster analysis suggested the presence of amphipathic β-strands and α-helices (Fig. 1). This prediction was used to search for three-dimensional folds comprising a βαββαβ domain in the protein data base. Three-dimensional structures satisfying these secondary structure constraints consisted of two α-helical segments lying on the same side of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. This secondary structure corresponded to that of MerP which, as previously noted (14Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), shares 21% sequence identity with HAH1. A molecular model was constructed using the known coordinates of the related folds and the refined coordinates of the NMR structure of MerP. This revealed the formation of a hydrophobic core at the interface of the two α-helices and one face of the anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig.2). The loop connecting the first β-strand to the first α-helix contained residues potentially involved in a metal binding site. Among these amino acids, two cysteines, Cys-12 and Cys-15, were expected to contribute two sulfur ligands to the metal binding site. The methionine, Met-10, is also conserved (Fig. 1), but a direct role for this residue as a metal ligand is unclear. The location of a third cysteine residue, Cys-41, was revealed to be distant from the metal binding site as indicated (Fig. 2). A cluster of lysine residues at the carboxyl terminus represents a conserved motif in the human and yeast copper chaperones (Fig. 1), and two of these residues, Lys-57 and Lys-60, were predicted to be in the vicinity of the metal binding site according to the model as shown. Two-dimensional 1H NMR of recombinant HAH1 confirmed the presence of the β-strands and α-helices according to the chemical shifts observed in the peaks of the fingerprint region (data not shown). The three-dimensional model of HAH1 suggested a potential approach to begin to characterize the structure and function of this protein. Therefore, recombinant HAH1 was overexpressed in bacteria, and the purified protein was analyzed by mass spectroscopy (Fig.3). The recombinant protein contains three additional residues, GSH, at the amino terminus, and mass analysis of the purified protein identified a single polypeptide of the predicted molecular weight, suggesting that the wild type apoprotein is purified in the oxidized form (Fig. 3 A). Reduction of HAH1 by the addition of dithiothreitol to the dialysis buffer during purification resulted in a molecular species with a mass difference of two daltons (Fig. 3 B). These data indicated the formation of a disulfide bond in the oxidized protein sample. Spectroscopic analysis of wild type and cysteine mutants of oxidized HAH1 with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) revealed the presence of one free sulfhydryl group in the wild type protein, one free sulfhydryl group in the C12G,C15G double mutant and two free sulfhydryl groups in the C12G single mutant (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the disulfide bridge observed by mass spectroscopy most likely forms between residues Cys-12 and Cys-15 as predicted from the HAH1 model (Fig. 2). The structural model and spectroscopic studies of recombinant HAH1 support the concept of metal binding involving the MXCXXC motif of this protein. To directly examine this possibility, cobalt binding was studied using ultraviolet-visible wavelength scanning spectroscopy. When cobalt was added to reduced recombinant wild type HAH1 under anaerobic conditions in the absence of excess reducing agent, a strong signal in the near ultraviolet range was observed that was absent for the C12G,C15G double mutant (Fig.4 A, shoulders at 280 and 308 nm). This absorbance was attributed to charge transfer, suggesting that the cobalt was bound to sulfur atoms. Reconstitution of HAH1 with cobalt in the presence of excess β-mercaptoethanol resulted in the appearance of two additional signals at 398 and 478 nm attributed to coordination of the metal by additional sulfur atoms provided by the reducing agent (Fig. 4 B). A similar, but much weaker, pattern of absorption was observed with cobalt and β-mercaptoethanol alone. These spectral properties of HAH1 in the presence of reducing agents suggest a different metal binding site geometry possibly due to the coordination of cobalt by external ligands, supporting the concept from the structural model that the metal binding site is solvent-accessible (Fig. 2). In the reducing environment of the cell, copper binding would be anticipated to occur as Cu(I) and in support of this, ultraviolet-visible wavelength scanning spectroscopy of recombinant HAH1 reconstituted with Cu(II) revealed no absorption peak in the visible region (data not shown). To directly examine copper binding to HAH1, wild type or C12G,C15G double-mutant proteins were incubated with64Cu as CuCl2 in the presence of excess reducing agent. In these studies, ubiquitin, a similarly sized, non-copper-binding protein served as a control for nonspecific binding. As can be seen in Fig. 5, under these conditions, recombinant HAH1 specifically bound Cu(I), and this binding was abrogated by mutation of the cysteine residues in the putative metal binding motif. These findings were supported by studies of HAH1 copper binding using bicinchoninic acid chelation, which also indicated that copper was bound as Cu(I) (data not shown). The metal binding data indicated that HAH1 bound copper as Cu(I)in vitro and that the Cys-12 and Cys-15 residues serve as ligands in this binding. To directly examine the functional role of these residues, wild type and mutant HAH1 cDNAs were transformed into an atx1Δ strain of S. cerevisiae. Previous studies have shown that yeast strains lacking ATX1 are deficient in high affinity iron uptake and that expression of HAH1 in these strains permits growth on iron-depleted medium by restoring copper incorporation into the multicopper oxidase Fet3p (16Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.-J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To examine expression of HAH1 in these yeast strains, immunoblot analysis was performed on equivalent amounts of protein from total cell lysates of atx1Δ mutants transformed with vector alone (Fig.6, lane 2) or plasmids containing wild type (Fig. 6, lane 1) or mutant HAH1 cDNA (Fig. 6, lanes 3–7). As can be seen in this analysis, a single 7.5-kDa protein was observed in each of the transformants that was equivalent in size to that observed for HAH1 in human tissues and cell lines.1 The function of HAH1 in these transformants was examined by analyzing copper incorporation into newly synthesized Fet3p. After metabolic labeling with 64Cu, equivalent amounts of crude plasma membrane fractions from atx1Δ transformants were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. As can be seen in Fig.7 A, a single 80-kDa radioactive band corresponding to holoFet3p was observed under these conditions in membrane fractions from the atx1Δ mutant transformed with wild type HAH1 (Fig. 7 A, lane 1), directly demonstrating restoration of copper incorporation into Fet3p. As anticipated, no Fet3p was detected under these same conditions in membrane extracts from atx1Δ mutants transformed with vector alone (Fig. 7 A, lane 2) or in the fet3Δ strain (Fig. 7 A, lane 8). Mutation of Cys-12 decreased the amount of copper incorporated into Fet3p (Fig. 7 A, lane 4), and mutation of both Cys-12 and Cys-15 eliminated holoFet3p biosynthesis (Fig.7 A, lane 6), confirming the essential role of these cysteine residues in copper binding. In contrast, mutation of Cys-15 or Met-10 alone had no effect on copper delivery to Fet3p (Fig.7 A, lanes 3 and 5). HoloFet3p synthesis was likewise unaffected by mutation of the conserved lysine residues in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 7 A, lane 7). These findings were not attributable to alterations in the amount of Fet3p among the transformants, as revealed by immunoblot analysis of Fet3p using equivalent amounts of membrane protein (Fig. 7 B). As observed previously, when analyzed under these conditions, the protein that is devoid of copper migrated more slowly than the holoprotein and is detected as a doublet due to differences in glycosylation (11Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Yeast strains lacking copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are sensitive to dioxygen and auxotrophic for lysine when grown aerobically. The ATX1 gene was originally isolated by virtue of its ability to reverse the lysine auxotrophy ofsod1Δ yeast in a copper-dependent fashion, and previous studies demonstrated that expression of HAH1 in these strains restores growth on lysine-deficient media (16Klomp L.W.J.

As the antioxidant function of Atx1p is copper-dependent (14Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the role of HAH1 metal binding residues in this antioxidant function was examined. Wild type and mutant HAH1 cDNAs were introduced intosod1Δ yeast, and these transformed yeast were then analyzed for their ability to grow aerobically on plates lacking lysine (Fig. 8). Although all transformants were able to grow in oxygen in complete medium containing lysine (Fig. 8,SD), only the wild type HAH1 and the M10I mutant were able to restore growth in lysine-deficient medium, indicating that both the Cys-12 and Cys-15 residues are essential for this function of HAH1. Unexpectedly, mutation of the conserved lysines in the carboxyl terminus also prevented HAH1 from restoring the lysine auxotrophy in the sod1Δ yeast (Fig. 8, K57G,K60G) revealing a direct role for these residues in the antioxidant function of HAH1. These findings were not due to differences in the amount of HAH1 expressed in the sod1Δ transformants as revealed by immunoblot analysis of HAH1 (data not shown). Furthermore, identical findings were obtained when the point mutations shown were made with serine instead of glycine as the substituting amino acid (data not shown). The results of this study demonstrate that HAH1 binds Cu(I) and that this binding is dependent upon the cysteine residues in the conserved MXCXXC motif in the amino terminus of the protein. The data also indicate that these cysteine residues are essential for HAH1 to function in copper trafficking to the secretory pathway and in antioxidant defense in vivo. In the wild type protein, the methionine in this motif would not appear to be essential for either of these functions. However, holoFet3p biosynthesis was preserved in atx1Δ strains transformed with HAH1 lacking only one of these cysteines, suggesting that under certain circumstances this methionine residue may contribute as a copper ligand. The quantitative difference in Fet3p copper incorporation between the Cys-12 and Cys-15 mutants (Fig. 7) may reflect steric differences in the ability of this methionine to form a copper coordination with these two residues. Within the reducing environment of the cell, an exogenous thiol may also coordinate as a weak copper ligand as revealed by the cobalt binding studies, which demonstrate a spectral change in the presence of excess reducing agent suggestive of solvent accessibility of the bound metal (Fig. 4 B). The results of the site-directed mutagenesis studies reported here are supported by structural and functional studies of the bacterial Hg(II) transport protein MerP, which demonstrate that the bound mercury is bicoordinate with the cysteine ligands in the conserved MXCXXC motif (22Steele R.A. Opella S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Morby A.P. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although an analogous copper binding structure has not been previously described, recent spectroscopic studies from O'Halloran and co-workers (33Pufahl R. Singer P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 238: 853-856Crossref Scopus (590) Google Scholar) on the yeast HAH1 homologue Atx1p suggest that this protein can adopt a two- or three-coordinate copper ligand site involving the conserved cysteines and either the proximate methionine or an exogenous thiol. Although analysis of these HAH1 mutants is consistent with this data, the precise nature of this ligand environment must await x-ray crystallographic analysis. The MXCXXC motif constituting the HAH1 copper binding site detected in this study is also present in the amino terminus of all known copper-transporting P-type ATPases (34Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This motif is repeated 6-fold in the human Wilson and Menkes ATPases, and recent studies indicate that Cu(I) is bound by the conserved cysteine residues in the corresponding regions of these two proteins (29Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As Atx1p and HAH1 have been shown to be directly involved in the pathway of copper transfer to the ATPases, these findings suggest the possibility of direct copper transfer from HAH1 to the Wilson and Menkes proteins via these homologous motifs. Indeed, recent studies reveal a copper-dependent, protein-protein interaction between Atx1p and Ccc2p involving these homologous copper binding motifs (33Pufahl R. Singer P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 238: 853-856Crossref Scopus (590) Google Scholar). This observation has led to the proposal that the copper binding motifs of the ATPases may contribute cysteine ligands to the solvent-accessible copper in Atx1p, thereby providing a facile mechanism for the rapid transfer of copper between these proteins (33Pufahl R. Singer P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 238: 853-856Crossref Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The MXCXXC motif may thus be ideally suited as a functional protein domain permitting the binding and sequestration of copper and yet allowing for the rapid exchange of this metal as needed to specific proteins at diverse cellular sites. Such a concept is supported by the identification of a homologous motif in the recently characterized yeast and human copper chaperones for superoxide dismutase (18Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The data in this study also reveal a specific role for the conserved lysines in the carboxyl terminus of HAH1, as mutation of these residues prevented rescue of lysine auxotrophy in sod1Δ yeast (Fig.8). These lysine residues are conserved among the ATX1homologues but are not present in the related mercury transport proteins (Fig. 1). Studies by Culotta and Lin (14Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) originally identified ATX1 as a multi-copy suppressor of oxidative damage in yeast strains lacking superoxide dismutase. This antioxidant function of ATX1 is copper-dependent, and this is consistent with the site-directed mutagenesis studies reported here (Fig. 8). Although the mechanism of the antioxidant function of HAH1 is unknown, Atx1p has no antioxidant activity in vitro (15Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), suggesting that the antioxidant function is mediated by transfer of copper to a target downstream of HAH1. Interestingly, unlike the findings with holoFet3p biosynthesis, the single cysteine HAH1 mutants did not retain the ability to suppress lysine auxotrophy, perhaps indicating that different ligand structures may be utilized for copper transfer in this antioxidant pathway. Alternatively, these findings may reflect differing sensitivities of the assays used in this study. The mutagenesis studies indicate that this pathway is independent of copper transport to the secretory compartment, and this is supported by studies demonstrating that the antioxidant activity of Atx1p is maintained in sod1Δ/ccc2Δ yeast (15Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The dependence of HAH1 antioxidant function upon the conserved lysine residues in the carboxyl terminus suggests that, analogous to the ATPase interaction discussed above, this region may function as a recognition motif for protein-protein interaction between HAH1 and a novel copper-dependent protein. Taken together the results of these studies support the concept that HAH1 is a member of the newly proposed class of intracellular proteins termed copper chaperones (18Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 33Pufahl R. Singer P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 238: 853-856Crossref Scopus (590) Google Scholar). These chaperones are proposed to bind and transport copper to the appropriate protein in the cell and, in some cases, to facilitate formation of the active site of the target protein. This emerging picture of copper chaperones may have important biomedical implications. For example, recent studies reveal that gain-of-function mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase result in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis due to altered copper-dependent functions of this enzyme (35Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.G. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 36Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Recent findings that copper chelation may ameliorate the course of neurodegeneration in a transgenic model of this disease (37Hottinger A.F. Fine E.G. Gurney M.E. Zurn A. Aebischer P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1548-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) provide a compelling example that copper chaperones may be ideal pharmacotherapeutic targets to manipulate intracellular copper homeostasis. Further studies on the mechanism of metal binding and transfer by such proteins as well as a careful analysis of their genetic and metabolic regulation in mammalian cells should therefore be useful.

The yeast protein GCN5 (yGCN5) has long been known to collaborate with yeast GCN4 in the transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes involved in yeast amino acid biosynthesis and to be involved in maximally increasing the transcriptional activity of several respiratory genes which depend on the yeast HAP2/3/4/5 complex (13McNabb D.S.

Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) and is thought to acetylate specific N-terminal histone lysine resides as a consequence of its association with additional adaptor proteins in two large multicomponent complexes, referred to as the SAGA complexes (21Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). In these complexes, additional protein components are thought to modulate yGCN5 substrate specificity, and together these large adaptor structures serve to link upstream activators with the basic RNA polymerase II machinery. Recent cloning and characterization of the human equivalents of these yeast adaptor components (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), which has been shown to physically associate with the general transcriptional coactivator, p300/CBP (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), and the hormone receptor cofactor, ACTR (24Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D.

In this report the NF-Y complex has been shown to possess HAT activityin vivo through physical association with the known HAT enzymes, hGCN5 and P/CAF. hGCN5 activates an NF-Y CCAAT box reporterin vivo and associates with the NF-YB:YC histone-fold motif,in vitro. This report further identifies the first transcription factor target for hGCN5, suggests that yGCN5 likewise is associated with the yeast HAP2/3/5 complex through the HAP3/5 histone-fold, and thereby suggests a direct functional role for yGCN5 in global yeast respiratory gene regulation. HeLa and 293 cells were maintained in 10-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Full-length human GCN5 (provided by X.-J. Yang and Y. Nakatani) (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used to generate a site-directed mutation of the proximal CCAAT box site contained in the α2(I) collagen promoter. Both the wild-type and NF-Y mutant promoters were cloned into the pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega) to generate pH6 GL3 and pH6m GL3, respectively, and verified using standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method and assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using the Dual-Light assay system (Tropix). Human GCN5 was cloned into pRSETA (Invitrogen) and pGEX2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) vectors using PCR. The C-terminal deletion mutant of hGCN5 was prepared from GST-hGCN5 by restriction enzyme digestion and contains amino acids 1–332; the “bromodomain” (27Haynes S.R. Sollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 80: 2603Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar) containing N-terminal deletion of hGCN5 was cloned into pGEX2TK using PCR and contains amino acids 337–476 (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). His-hGCN5 was purified from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) lysates following induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h at 37 °C using Ni2+ chelating resin (Novagen). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (28Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). YA (DBD), YB (DBD), and YC (DBD) were cloned into pGEX2TK using PCR and contain amino acids 234–303, 53–143, and 1–143, respectively (15Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The cloning expression and purification of full-length GST- and His-NF-YABC subunits has been described previously (30Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) have been described. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (34Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). 293 cells were collected by scraping into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and pelleted by gentle centrifugation. PBS was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 750 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysis mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min, then cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Antibodies were added to 100 μl of either HeLa nuclear extract or 293 whole cell extract at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose:protein G-Sepharose (15 μl; 1:1) (Pharmacia) was added, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed six times at 4 °C with 1.5 ml of lysis buffer, followed by two washes with 1 × PBS (1 mmDTT), and two washes with 1 × HAT reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmEDTA) and assayed as described (34Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Acetylation reactions were performed for 20 min at 30 °C, and products were resolved with 12% SDS-PAGE gels and fluorography (Amplify; Amersham Corp.). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against the NF-YB and NF-YA subunits were prepared as described (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-552Google Scholar). Affinity-purified α-YB antibodies were chemically cross-linked to Affi-Gel 10 beads according to the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). In blocking experiments GST fusion proteins were incubated with α-YB antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h prior to the addition of HeLa nuclear extract; IP analyses were preformed as described above. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against human GCN5 and P/CAF were kindly provided by X.-J. Yang and Y. Nakatani (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against p300 (PharMingen) and E1A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were obtained commercially. Proteins bound to α-YB affinity beads following washing with IP lysis buffer were eluted using SDS-PAGE buffer with no reducing agents at room temperature. Immunoprecipitates in all cases were then heated to 95 °C under reducing conditions, electrophoresed through 12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of primary affinity-purified antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected using α-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) and ECL (Amersham). Purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) (20 μl packed bead volume) with gentle mixing for 20 min at room temperature in 100 μl of 1 × PBS (1 mm DTT), then washed with 2 ml of PBS. In specific cases beads were further incubated with additional NF-Y subunits, then washed with PBS. Recombinant His-hGCN5 was added, and the incubation continued at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing. Beads were washed and processed for HAT activity as described for immunoprecipitates above. YA (DBD) was cleaved from GST-YA (DBD) using thrombin and 32P-labeled using heart muscle creatine kinase (Sigma). GST fusion proteins were bound to glutatione-agarose beads then incubated with the assembled32P-NF-Y complex or the 32P-YA (DBD) subunit alone. Beads were washed as described above for immunoprecipitations, and retained 32P-YA (DBD) was eluted and analyzed using SDS-PAGE gels. During study of accessory protein cofactor interactions with the NF-Y complex (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a CCAAT box DNA affinity-purified NF-Y fraction was observed to possess histone acetyltransferase activity. To address whether this HAT activity was copurifying or physically associated with NF-Y in vivo, affinity-purified α-NF-YB and α-NF-YA antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate NF-Y derived from HeLa nuclear and 293 whole cell extracts and tested using the IP-HAT assay (8Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 35Mizzen C.A. Yang X.-J. Kobubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (623) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A andB). IP-HAT analysis of the NF-Y complex using either of these subunit directed antibodies resulted in acetylation of the core histone proteins, H3, H2B, H2A, and to a lesser extent, histone H4. Control α-p300 antibodies brought down HAT activity in both cell types in a manner similar to α-NF-Y antibodies, whereas α-E1A antibodies precipitated HAT activity only in 293 extracts and not HeLa extracts as predicted (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 8Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Preincubation of affinity-purified α-YB antibodies with the purified immunogen, GST-YB, effectively blocked specific NF-Y-associated IP-HAT activity (Fig. 1 C). Recombinant human GCN5 (hGCN5) acetylated histone H3 predominantly in this liquid HAT assay as has been observed previously with both yeast and human GCN5 (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 35Mizzen C.A. Yang X.-J. Kobubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Deletion of histone substrates or substitution with bovine serum albumin in the IP-HAT assay resulted in no acetylation, whereas both the α-YA and α-YB immunoprecipitates retained specific CCAAT box DNA binding activity, a property of the heterotrimeric NF-Y complex (data not shown). To identify the protein(s) responsible for the observed NF-Y-associated HAT activity, α-YB immunoprecipitates derived from HeLa extracts were analyzed for the presence of known HAT proteins using Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 D). Both hGCN5 and P/CAF HAT proteins were detected in α-YB affinity bead immunoprecipitates using α-hGCN5 affinity-purified antibodies, which were raised against full-length hGCN5 and cross-react with P/CAF (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) (lane 2). P/CAF and NF-YB were also detected in HeLa α-YB immunoprecipitates using affinity-purified α-P/CAF antibodies, which were raised against the unique N-terminal region of P/CAF and do not cross-react with hGCN5 (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) (lane 4) and affinity-purified α-YB antibodies (lane 6), respectively. These results suggested that hGCN5 and P/CAF were associated with NF-Y in vivo and responsible for the observed HAT activity. P/CAF has been shown to associate with the coactivator, p300/CBP (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), which itself has intrinsic HAT activity, however p300/CBP was not detected in HeLa α-YB immunoprecipitates using Western analysis (data not shown). To examine the possible functional role of hGCN5 in modulating NF-Y transcriptional activityin vivo, HeLa cells were transfected with hGCN5 and an NF-Y CCAAT box containing promoter reporter derived from the murine collagen α2(I) gene (25Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Chrombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The observed ∼4-fold activation of this reporter by hGCN5 was dependent on an intact proximal CCAAT box element, suggesting that hGCN5 functionally interacts and regulates NF-Y transactivation potential on a natural CCAAT box-containing promoter. To examine the possibility that the NF-Y complex possesses intrinsic HAT activity, individual and specific combinations of recombinant NF-Y subunits were tested for HAT activity using the liquid assay. Neither the complete functional NF-YA:B:C complex, the NF-YB:C heterodimer, nor any individual NF-Y subunit was observed to possess HAT activity (data not shown). An in vitro GST fusion protein “pull-down” assay was developed to determine the specific NF-Y subunit requirements for physical association with hGCN5 (Fig.3). Recombinant hGCN5 was incubated with the assembled NF-Y complex, the NF-YB:C heterodimer, and individual NF-Y subunits that were tethered to glutathione-agarose beads, then assayed for HAT activity. Using this approach hGCN5 was shown to stably associate with the complete NF-Y complex and the NF-YB:C heterodimer. hGCN5 did not associate with any individual NF-Y subunit, whereas hGCN5 was observed to associate with the full-length YB:YC complex (data not shown) and in heterodimers composed of a full-length subunit and its complementing YB (DBD) or YC (DBD) partner (Fig. 3, lanes 6and 8, respectively). Recombinant hGCN5 (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 35Mizzen C.A. Yang X.-J. Kobubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (623) Google Scholar), P/CAF (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), and yGCN5 (37Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) are known to acetylate histone H3 predominantly in the liquid HAT assay when presented with the core histone proteins, whereas acetylation of any of the core histone proteins in nucleosomes by yeast GCN5 requires additional protein components assembed in the large molecular mass SAGA complexes (21Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 38Candau R. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Predominant acetylation of histone H3 by hGCN5 tethered to recombinant NF-Y or NF-YB:YC complexes (Fig. 3) suggests that the histone specificity of hGCN5, and possibly P/CAF, is altered when associated in the native NF-Y complex, since histones H2A and H2B were additionally acetylated by immunoprecipitated NF-Y in the IP-HAT assay (Fig. 1). In an attempt to map relevant functional domains in hGCN5 that are required for stable interaction with NF-Y, several GST-hGCN5 deletion mutants were tested using an in vitro GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4). NF-YA (DBD) has been used previously to assemble a functional heterotrimeric NF-Y complex and as an individual NF-YA subunit derivative to demonstrate that each stably interacts with a single AT-hook motif present in the non-histone chromosomal proteins, HMG-I(Y) (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 6). Interaction of hGCN5 with NF-Y was dependent on an intact NF-Y complex (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), since no specific interaction with YA (DBD) alone was observed (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal regions of hGCN5 severely inhibited its stable interaction with the assembled NF-Y complex (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). The hGCN5 C-terminal bromodomain (5Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 27Haynes S.R. Sollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 80: 2603Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar) contained in the N-terminal deletion mutant is not itself sufficient to support stable interaction between NF-Y and hGCN5 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). These results suggest that interaction with NF-Y requires specific domains in both the N- and C-terminal regions or that the primary interaction site maps to a region close to the deletion site. Both single nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structure are generally thought to represent structural impediments to gene transcription (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). Recent isolation of chromatin remodeling activities has provided new insights into the mechanisms responsible for altering chromatin structure during transcription and the means to begin approaching questions regarding the targeting of specific activities to specific promoters (2Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 3Tsukiyama T. Wu C.

Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Further refinement in the crystal structure of the core nucleosome particle (40Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6927) Google Scholar) has now supported earlier results (41van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10548-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which together suggest the N-terminal histone tails are involved in nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and are involved in maintaining higher order chromatin structure. Together these observations now suggest that acetylation of the N-terminal histone lysines residues is involved in disrupting the structure between nucleosomes in local regions in chromatin thereby facilitating access of transcription factors to specific promoters. In addition, recent reports have demonstrated that p53 is a substrate for p300 (10Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 87: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2177) Google Scholar), and the HAT enzymes, p300, P/CAF, and TAFII250, are capable of acetylating components of the general RNA polymerase II machinery (i.e. TFIIEβ and TFIIF) (42Imhof A. Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HAT enzymes play additional roles in modulating the DNA binding activity of an important tumor suppressor protein, and the functional activity of general initiation factors, and further suggest important implications for their role as cofactors in modulating upstream transcription factor transactivation potential. This report identifies the NF-Y complex as the first mammalian transcription factor target for the human acetyltransferase, GCN5, the first DNA-binding transcription factor associated with P/CAF, in vivo, and maps the site of interaction of hGCN5 to the highly conserved DBD elements of the NF-YB:C heterodimer. Anti-YB immunoprecipitates, which contain the NF-Y complex, were observed to be associated with the two highly related HAT enzymes, GCN5 and P/CAF. The C-terminal region of P/CAF is 86% identical on the amino acid level to hGCN5 (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), which includes both the region responsible for HAT activity and the bromodomain, a motif thought to be involved in additional protein-protein interactions (5Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 27Haynes S.R. Sollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 80: 2603Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of P/CAF is unique, and α-P/CAF antibodies (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) that recognize both N- and C-terminal regions were observed to detect P/CAF in α-YB immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 D). P/CAF has been shown to be associated with two cofactors, p/300/CBP (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

While P/CAF is known to interact with p300/CBP, hGCN5 does not (7Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), and presently no mammalian transcription factor has been shown to interact with both hGCN5 and P/CAF. NF-Y is the first DNA-binding transcription factor shown to be associated with P/CAF and hGCN5.In vitro binding studies between NF-Y and hGCN5 strongly suggest that P/CAF interacts with NF-Y likewise through its C-terminal region, which is highly related to hGCN5. Presently it is not known if these NF-Y: HAT complexes exhibit differential activities with regard to specific NF-Y-responsive promoters in vivo, and if the composition of NF-Y:HAT complexes differ with regard to additional protein components. Comparison of immunoprecipitated NF-Y-associated HAT activity within vitro reconstituted NF-Y:hGCN5 HAT activity showed an altered histone substrate specificity. Both histone H2A and H2B were observed to be acetylated when presented to NF-Y immunoprecipitates in addition to the predominant product, H3, while in vitroreconstituted complexes acetylated histone H3 exclusively. These results suggest that native NF-Y may be associated with additional protein components in vivo, in a manner possibly analogous to the yeast SAGA complexes that contain yGCN5, in addition to the characterized components, Spt 3/7/20, ADA2, ADA3, and other unknown components (21Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). hGCN5, yGCN5, and P/CAF are known to acetylate histone H3 predominantly when presented with the core histone proteins and to be unable to acetylate histones in isolated nucleosomes in the absence of additional protein components (7Yang X.-J.

Wang L. Barlev N. Ying C.Y. Rosen C.A. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), suggests that some fraction of both hGCN5 and P/CAF may be associated in vivo with hADA2 and mammalian equivalents of the SAGA complexes. Further analysis of α-NF-Y immunoprecipitates will determine if hADA2 is present and the identity of additional protein components that may play a role in regulating both hGCN5 and P/CAF histone substrate specificity. Mutational analysis of the NF-YB subunit has established that the YC interaction domain and the region required for DNA binding activity largely overlap in the ∼90-amino acid YB (DBD) (16Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NF-YA (DBD) element is more clearly defined and contains separable subdomains used for DNA binding and interaction with the YB:YC heterodimer. The YB:YC histone-fold motifs appear to play crucial roles in subunit interactions through creation of unique surfaces for interaction with the YA (DBD) and with the HAT enzymes, hGCN5 and P/CAF. The YB:YC histone-fold may make additional nonspecific contacts with DNA sequences flanking the CCAAT box, in a manner analogous to the H2B:H2A histone pair, whereas the YA (DBD) may make the majority of sequence-specific DNA contact in the CCAAT box, in addition to providing binding surfaces for HMG-I(Y) and PC4/p15 (39Currie R.A.

Clearly, x-ray crystallographic analyses of the NF-Y (DBD) regions in association with CCAAT box DNA and these newly identified HAT enzymes in the future will further our understanding of how these proteins are structurally organized and provide additional insights into how they function in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2053533223,"Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) has been implicated in the insulin-regulated trafficking of GLUT4 in adipocytes. It has been proposed that VAMP2 co-localizes with GLUT4 in a postendocytic storage compartment (Martin, S., Tellam, J., Livingstone, C., Slot, J. W., Gould, G. W., and James, D. E. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 134, 625–635), suggesting that it may play a role distinct from endosomal v-SNAREs (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) such as cellubrevin that are also expressed in adipocytes. The present study examines the effects of recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins encompassing the entire cytoplasmic tails of VAMP1, VAMP2, and cellubrevin on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in streptolysin O permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GST-VAMP2 inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by ∼35%, whereas GST-VAMP1 and GST-cellubrevin were without effect. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique N terminus of VAMP2 also inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in a dose-dependent manner. This peptide had no effect on either guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-stimulated GLUT4 translocation or on insulin-stimulated GLUT1 translocation. These results imply that GLUT4 and GLUT1 may undergo insulin-stimulated translocation to the cell surface from separate intracellular compartments. To confirm this, adipocytes were incubated with a transferrin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate to fill the itinerant endocytic system after which cells were incubated with H2O2 and diaminobenzidine. This treatment completely blocked insulin-stimulated movement of GLUT1, whereas in the case of GLUT4, movement to the surface was delayed but still reached similar levels to that observed in insulin-stimulated control cells after 30 min. These results suggest that the N terminus of VAMP2 plays a unique role in the insulin-dependent recruitment of GLUT4 from its intracellular storage compartment to the cell surface.

The molecular machinery that regulates the docking and fusion of intracellular vesicles with their appropriate target membranes is currently under intense investigation. From studies in the mammalian synapse it has been revealed that membrane proteins referred to as v-SNAREs, 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; GSV, GLUT4 storage vesicle; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; LDM, low density microsome(s); PM, plasma membrane(s); SSV, small synaptic vesicle; Tf, transferrin; Tf-HRP, transferrin-HRP conjugate; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; SNAP, synaptosome-associated protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SLO, streptolysin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; GSV, GLUT4 storage vesicle; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; LDM, low density microsome(s); PM, plasma membrane(s); SSV, small synaptic vesicle; Tf, transferrin; Tf-HRP, transferrin-HRP conjugate; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; SNAP, synaptosome-associated protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SLO, streptolysin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. located in transport vesicles, bind in a highly specific manner to t-SNAREs located in the target membrane (1Sollner T.

The high affinity and specificity of this interaction ensures that transport vesicles dock and fuse with their correct target membrane. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2 or synaptobrevin 2) has been shown to be the predominant v-SNARE that targets small synaptic vesicles (SSVs) to the presynaptic plasma membrane by interacting with its cognate t-SNAREs, syntaxin 1 and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) found on the target membrane (reviewed in Refs. 2Rothman J.E.

First, these proteins are the major substrates for tetanus toxin and various serotypes of botulinum toxins (reviewed in Ref. 5Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). For example, VAMP2 is cleaved at distinct sites by tetanus toxin and botulinum toxins B, D, F, and G. These cleavage sites are found within the central domain of VAMP2, which constitutes the t-SNARE binding domain (6Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Second, large gene families of v- and t-SNAREs have been identified in eucaryotic cells. From genetic studies in yeast, it appears that unique combinations of v- and t-SNAREs regulate vesicle transport events between distinct intracellular organelles. Furthermore, mutations in these proteins result in compartment-specific vesicle transport defects (reviewed in Refs. 2Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 3Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 4Bennett M.K.

Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was of interest because these cells, like neurons, also possess a regulated secretory system (reviewed in Ref.12James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This system responds to the metabolic needs of the adipocyte to increase the surface levels of a variety of proteins including the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 (13James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 14Birnbaum M.J.

These proteins are sequestered in the absence of insulin within an intracellular compartment, referred to here as intracellular GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs), which morphologically resemble SSVs in synapses (17Navone F. Jahn R. Di Gioia G. Stukenbrok H. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2511-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates the exocytosis of the GSVs resulting in a >10-fold increase in the levels of GLUT4 and vp165 proteins at the plasma membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for VAMP2 in the regulated movement of this compartment. First, VAMP2 co-localizes with GLUT4 and vp165 in GSVs (18Martin S. Rice J.E. Gould G.W. Keller S.R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Second, VAMP2 translocates from this intracellular compartment to the cell surface in response to insulin (19Martin S.

Finally, syntaxin 4 is specifically bound to VAMP2 (7Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H.

The insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in permeabilized or microinjected adipocytes was blocked by syntaxin 4-specific antibodies or a GST fusion protein encompassing the cytoplasmic tail of syntaxin 4 (23Tellam J.T.

Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), which are also expressed in insulin-sensitive cells (20Volchuk A.

VAMP1 is expressed at much lower levels than VAMP2 in adipocytes (23Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, cellubrevin is abundantly expressed and, like VAMP2, undergoes insulin-dependent movement to the cell surface (20Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that cellubrevin co-localizes with intracellular GLUT4 (20Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), although this may reflect the presence of both of these proteins in endosomes. Cellubrevin is also cleaved by tetanus toxin (26Yamasaki S. Bins T. Hayashi T. Szabo E. Yamasaki N. Eklund M. Jahn R. Niemann H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and, like VAMP2, binds to syntaxin 4 with reasonable affinity (23Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cellubrevin and VAMP2 are almost identical in amino acid sequence within the central coiled-coil t-SNARE binding domain that spans residues 15–68 in cellubrevin (25McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Hence, it is not surprising that both of these proteins have an overlapping t-SNARE binding specificity. However, VAMP2 differs from cellubrevin within its N terminus, sharing little amino acid identity as well as possessing an additional 13 amino acids (25McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in view of the overall similarities between these two proteins and the available data concerning their role in insulin action, it is difficult to determine if only one, or both, of these proteins is involved in the insulin-stimulated movement of GLUT4 in adipocytes.In the present study, we have attempted to dissect the potential role of VAMP1, VAMP2, or cellubrevin in GLUT4 trafficking by introducing recombinant fusion proteins or synthetic peptides comprising different domains of these proteins into permeabilized adipocytes and assessing their effects on insulin action. Our results suggest that VAMP2 is specifically involved in the insulin-dependent movement of GLUT4 to the cell surface from its intracellular storage compartment (GSV) but that it may not be involved in the insulin-dependent recruitment of other proteins such as GLUT1. This implies that insulin may stimulate exocytosis of distinct intracellular compartments, one being endosomes containing GLUT1 and the other being a separate postendocytic GLUT4 compartment. Using a chemical ablation technique following uptake of a Tf-HRP conjugate, we show that GLUT4-containing vesicles can still fuse with the cell surface following ablation of endosomes. This supports the notion that GLUT4 is partitioned into a separate intracellular compartment in adipocytes that can dock and fuse directly with the cell surface. We postulate that VAMP2 plays a specific role in the docking and fusion of GSVs with the cell surface in response to insulin.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture3T3-L1 fibroblasts (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown in DMEM containing high glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Commonwealth Serum Laboratory, Parkville, Australia). Confluent cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by the addition of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 4 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 mm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 100 ng/ml d-biotin (27Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 72 h, induction medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2.5% fetal calf serum, insulin, and biotin. Adipocytes were used for experiments 10–14 days following initiation of differentiation. Prior to use, cell monolayers were washed with serum-free DMEM to remove all serum-derived insulin and transferrin and incubated with serum-free DMEM for a minimum of 2 h.Streptolysin O (SLO) Permeabilization and Cell Treatment3T3-L1 adipocytes were permeabilized with SLO (28Bhakdi S.

Immunol. 1993; 182: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) as described previously (30Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were washed with cold intracellular buffer (ICB; 140 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and incubated with cold ICB containing 0.5 μg/ml SLO on ice for 10 min. Cells were again washed with ICB before incubation and treatment at 37 °C. Modified ICB containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and an ATP-regeneration system (40 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 mm ATP) was used as the incubation buffer in all experiments. SLO-treated cells were permeabilized by an initial 10-min incubation at 37 °C in the presence or absence of test protein. The cells were then incubated for an additional 15 min in modified ICB containing the test protein with or without stimulus (either 1 μm insulin or 100 μm GTPγS).Subcellular FractionationTo determine the relative levels of different proteins at the cell surface, two different subcellular fractionation techniques were employed.The Plasma Membrane Lawn AssayThe plasma membrane lawn assay is a technique previously described by our laboratory to generate highly purified plasma membrane (PM) fragments (30Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31Robinson L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E383-E393PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of the level of different proteins in this membrane was achieved using antibodies specific for cytoplasmic epitopes combined with immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells cultured on glass coverslips were treated as described in the figure legends. At the conclusion of the experiment, cells were rapidly washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by a 30-s treatment in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma). The cells were swollen by three rapid washes in hypotonic buffer (13 × buffer A), transferred to buffer A (70 mm KCl, 30 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), and sonicated using a probe sonicator (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) to generate a lawn of PM fragments attached to the glass. The membranes were then fixed to the coverslips for 15 min using freshly prepared 2% formaldehyde (Probing and Structure, Thuringowa, Queensland, Australia) in buffer A. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 100 mm glycine followed by an additional 30-min incubation in PBS containing 5% milk powder. Cells were washed with PBS three times, washed three times over a 10-min period. Coverslips were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times over a 10-min period with PBS. The coverslips were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS prior to mounting and viewing. Coverslips were viewed using × 40 and × 63/1.40 Zeiss oil immersion objectives on a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal imaging system. For each experiment, samples were run in duplicate, and 10 random representative images were collected from each. Fluorescence was quantified using NIH Image analysis software.A Differential Centrifugation ProcedureA differential centrifugation procedure was also used to determine the subcellular distribution of proteins in permeabilized adipocytes as described previously (32Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochem. Biophys Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 10-cm plates/condition) were rinsed twice in cold HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) and homogenized in HES buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 250 μm PMSF) (2 ml/plate) by 10 passes through a 27-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,300 × g in a Sorvall high speed centrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed and layered onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1.12 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in an SW41 rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) for 60 min at 4 °C. The membranous layer above the cushion contains highly enriched PMs as described previously (32Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochem. Biophys Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The supernatant from the initial spin was subsequently centrifuged at 38,700 × g for 20 min to remove endoplasmic reticulum and smaller pieces of the plasma membrane. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 75 min to generate the low density microsomal pellet (LDM) that is enriched in the intracellular GLUT4 storage vesicles (32Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were resuspended in HES buffer containing protease inhibitors (50–100 μl). The protein concentration of these subcellular membrane fractions was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce).Antibodies, GST Fusion Proteins, and Synthetic PeptidesRabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides encompassing the last 12 amino acids of GLUT1 and GLUT4 have been described previously (13James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 32Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies were used for immunofluorescence microscopy at dilutions of 1:200 and 1:500, respectively. A polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant GST fusion protein encompassing the entire cytoplasmic tail of vp165 was kindly provided by Dr. Susanna Keller (Dartmouth Medical School). GST fusion proteins comprising the cytoplasmic tails of VAMP2, VAMP1, and cellubrevin were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Scheller (Stanford, CA). VAMP2 peptides (human/murine VAMP2-(1–15) and rat VAMP2-(1–25)) were synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes (Melbourne Australia). Irrelevant peptide used as control was as follows: H-MPSGAQQIGSED-OH).Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingEquivalent amounts of subcellular fractionations (10 μg of protein) were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE using a 10% resolving gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK), which were incubated with 5% milk powder in PBS for 60 min at room temperature and then with polyclonal antibodies diluted in PBS and 1% milk powder at dilutions of 1:500 for 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times over 30 min with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000; Pierce). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate stable peroxide solution (Pierce).Endosome Ablation Using HRP-conjugated TransferrinTransferrin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Tf-HRP) was prepared by the carbodiimide method and purified as described (34Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The conjugate was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. A sample was assayed for protein and iron-loaded as described (34Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After a 2-h incubation in serum-free DMEM, adipocytes were incubated with 20 μg/ml Tf-HRP for the times indicated to fill the transferrin itinerary. Cells were thereafter chilled by washing in ice-cold isotonic citrate buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.0) and kept on ice to prevent any further vesicle trafficking during the DAB cytochemistry reactions (see below). Cell surface-attached Tf-HRP was removed by acid washing for three consecutive 10 min washes in ice-cold isotonic citrate buffer followed by a single wash in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4.DAB (freshly prepared as a 2 mg/ml stock and 0.22 mm-filtered) was added at 100 μg/ml to all cells, and H2O2 was added to 0.02% (v/v) to one of each pair of wells. After a 60-min incubation at 4 °C in the dark, the reaction was stopped by washing in PBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA. In experiments deigned to measure the translocation of GLUT4 before and after ablation, duplicate wells of cells grown on coverslips were incubated in serum-free media for 2 h, and Tf-HRP was added for a further 1 h. After this time, cells were washed into ice-cold citrate buffer, and DAB was added to all plates. Half of the cells were then exposed to hydrogen peroxide. After incubation in the dark at 4 °C as outlined above, cells were rapidly washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then three further times in Krebs ringer phosphate buffer at 37 °C and placed on a hot plate in order to maintain the temperature of the media at 37 °C. Insulin (or vehicle) was added to the wells for the times shown in the figures at 1 μm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. After this incubation, cells were rapidly washed into ice-cold buffer, PM lawns were prepared as described above, and were washed three times with filtered PBS and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were washed a further three times with PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) fish tail gelatin and 1% (v/v) goat serum, followed by three further washes in filtered PBS. Coverslips were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times over a 10-min period with PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) fish tail gelatin and 1% (v/v) goat serum and then washed a further three times in filtered PBS. The coverslips were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) fish tail gelatin and 1% (v/v) goat serum and then washed a further three times in filtered PBS prior to mounting and viewing under immunofluorescence conditions. Coverslips were viewed using a × 40 objective lens on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope operated in Laser Scanning Confocal mode. Samples were illuminated at 488 nm, and the signal at 510 nm was collected. Fluorescent images were quantified using Imaris software running on a Silicon Graphics Indy computer. Intensities of three images at each time point were averaged to give mean ± S.D. Data are expressed as percentage of fluorescence intensity observed in the basal state.Transferrin Receptor Externalization AssaysThese assays were performed exactly as described by Tanner and Lienhard (35Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate 35-mm plates of cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h. During the last hour"

In previous studies, we showed that a point mutation in this motif (RPAm) cannot support SV40 DNA replication. We have now investigated the role of this motif in several steps of DNA replication and in two DNA repair pathways. RPAm associates with T antigen, assists the unwinding of double-stranded DNA at an origin of replication, stimulates DNA polymerases α and δ, and supports the formation of the initial short Okazaki fragments. However, the synthesis of a leading strand and later Okazaki fragments is impaired. In contrast, RPAm can function well during the incision step of nucleotide excision repair and in a full repair synthesis reaction, with either UV-damaged or cisplatin-adducted DNA. Two deletion mutants of the Rpa1 subunit (eliminating amino acids 1–278 or 222–411) were not functional in nucleotide excision repair. We report for the first time that wild type RPA is required for a mismatch repair reaction in vitro. Neither the deletion mutants nor RPAm can support this reaction. Therefore, the zinc finger of the largest subunit of RPA is required for a function that is essential for DNA replication and mismatch repair but not for nucleotide excision repair.

It was first purified from HeLa and 293 cell extracts as an essential component of SV40 DNA replication (1Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl.

Binding to single-stranded DNA with high affinity is a hallmark of human replication protein A, and purification of this protein largely takes advantage of this property (3Fairman M.P. Stillman B.

Rpa1 is the most well characterized subunit among the complex. Rpa1 alone confers the high affinity for single-stranded DNA (5Wold M.S. Weinberg D.H. Virshup D.M. Li J.J. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2801-2809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12090-12098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rpa1 can be subdivided into 3 domains: an N-terminal domain of protein-protein interaction, a central domain for DNA interaction, and a C-terminal domain for complex formation with Rpa2–3 (8Lin Y.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10558-10568Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). RPA is highly conserved throughout evolution. Homologous heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding proteins have been identified in nearly all eukaryotes examined (10Heyer W.D. Rao M.R. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All genes reveal significant homology between species at the amino acid level. All of the known Rpa1 homologs contain a conserved putative C4-type zinc finger motif in the C-terminal third of the protein (7Erdile L.F. Heyer W.D. Kolodner R. Kelly T.J. J. Biol.

In fact, a point mutation that disrupts the putative zinc finger eliminates DNA replication, confirming the importance of this highly conserved motif (8Lin Y.L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E.

With its interaction with ssDNA, T antigen, and DNA polymerase α-primase complex, hRPA assists T antigen to unwind the origin (2Wold M.S. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Besides the interaction with repair proteins (XPA, XPG, and XPF see below) and replication proteins, hRPA has also been implicated in interactions with transcription factors p53 (31Dutta A.

Since DNA repair reactions generally involve DNA synthesis to form a repair patch, it is perhaps not surprising that hRPA takes part in DNA repair and can modulate the repair synthesis step (38Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the most important function of RPA is at an earlier stage of nucleotide excision repair (21Coverley D. Kenny M.K. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Lane D.P. Wood R.D. Nature. 1991; 349: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Coverley D. Kenny M.K. Lane D.P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and analysis of nicking of UV-irradiated plasmid DNA during excision repair revealed that RPA is necessary for incision formation (40Shivji K.K. Kenny M.K. Wood R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). RPA is an essential factor for dual incision of damaged DNA with purified human protein components (41Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 42Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The Rpa1 and Rpa2 subunits of hRPA interact with the nucleotide excision repair protein XPA, probably to increase the efficiency of damage recognition, and this would be expected to modulate the excision reaction (22He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 43Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4152-4157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, RPA can also modulate the efficiency of cleavage by the incision enzyme XPG and ERCC1-XPF (45Matsunaga T. Park C.H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A role for hRPA in general mismatch repair in eukaryotes has not been defined. E. coli SSB protein is required in a reconstituted system of mismatch repair with purified bacterial proteins (46Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It therefore seems reasonable that hRPA could be involved in eukaryotic mismatch repair. To help dissect the role of RPA in DNA replication and repair, we have taken advantage of three defined mutants in the Rpa1 subunit (8Lin Y.L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All of the Rpa1 mutants form a stable heterotrimeric complex and show a similar extent of binding to single-stranded DNA under physiological conditions. The present work examines their ability to function during defined steps in DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair. The experiments reveal requirements for intact domains in Rpa1 that differ depending on the DNA transaction, suggesting that specific interactions take place during each of the three DNA replication and repair processes examined. The plasmid expressing wild type and various RPA mutants were described in a previous report (8Lin Y.L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The proteins were named according to the Rpa1 mutant present in the complex. The proteins were expressed and purified as described (4Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The baculovirus expressing DNA polymerase α/primase subunits were generous gifts from Drs. Teresa Wang and Ellen Fanning. DNA polymerase α/primase was expressed in Hi-5 cells with baculovirus infection and purified by immunoaffinity column chromatography with monoclonal antibody SJK-237-71 specific for the large subunit p180 (47Copeland W.C. Wang T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11028-11040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T Ag was also purified from baculovirus-infected Hi-5 cells by immunoaffinity column chromatography with monoclonal Ab Pab 419 (48Lanford R.E. Virology. 1988; 167: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Polymerase δ was purified from calf thymus in four steps (DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, S-Sepharose, and Mono-Q chromatography). 2T. Tsurimoto, personal communication. The conditions in DEAE-cellulose and phenyl-Sepharose columns were as described (49Lee M.Y. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The active fractions from phenyl-Sepharose eluate were pooled and loaded onto an S-Sepharose column (5 mg/ml bed) pre-equilibrated with buffer D (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol). After the column was washed with 2–3 bed volumes of buffer D containing 0.1 m KCl, DNA polymerase δ activity was eluted stepwise with a KCl gradient from 0.1 to 1 m in the same buffer. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer E (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.025 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 20% sucrose. The dialyzed enzyme was loaded onto a Mono-Q column pre-equilibrated with buffer E. After washing with 5 bed volumes with buffer E, polymerase δ activity was eluted with a NaCl linear gradient from 0.025 to 0.5m in the same buffer. PCNA-stimulated DNA polymerase activity eluted at 0.2 m NaCl fractions just prior to the protein peak. The resulting polymerase can be stimulated 10-fold by PCNA on a poly(dA)/oligo(dT) template and has no detectable activity on a primed M13 ssDNA template unless PCNA and RF-C were both present. Baculoviruses expressing subunits of human RF-C and calf thymus RF-C protein were the generous gift of V. Podust and E. Fanning (Vanderbilt University) (50Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol.

Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products were linearized with HindIII and analyzed on a 0.8% alkaline agarose gel. The gel was fixed in 8% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid after electrophoresis and dried. The incorporation of [α-32P]dCMP was determined using the DE81 paper and scintillation counting (51Dutta A. Winchester E. Pagano M. Cell Cycle-Materials and Methods. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., NY1995: 175-185Google Scholar). The assay is essentially based on previous reports (52Bullock P.A. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2350-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 53Denis D. Bullock P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2882-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmDTT, 4 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.2 units of creatine kinase, 0.6 μg of supercoiled SV40 origin-containing plasmid (pSV010), 0.84 μg of T Ag, 1.4 μg of recombinant RPA preparations as indicated, and RPA-depleted 293 cell lysate. Reaction mixtures were preincubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the absence of T Ag to lower T Ag-independent labeling of form II DNA and then further incubated for 15 min after the addition of T Ag. Reaction mixtures were pulse-labeled for 1 min by the addition of 3.5 μl of a solution containing [α-32P]dCTP (final concentration in the complete reaction, 1 μm, 300 cpm/fmol) dATP, dGTP, and dTTP (final concentration of 100 μm each) and CTP, GTP, and UTP (final concentration of 200 μm each). The reactions were terminated by addition of 30 μl of stop solution (60 mmEDTA, 0.3% (w/v) SDS, 2 mg/ml of Pronase) and incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. The products were extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation, boiled for 4 min in an equal volume of formamide loading buffer, and analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 15 min, dried, and analyzed by radiography. The origin unwinding reaction was carried out in 20-μl volumes containing unwinding buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.8 units of creatine phosphokinase) in the presence of 72 ng of T Ag, 0.2 μg ofSau3A-digested carrier λ DNA, 50–60 ng of radiolabeledHindIII-SphI fragment of pSV010, and the indicated amounts of recombinant RPA (54Goetz G.S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h and terminated by adding 10 μl of stop solution (described above) followed by continued incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The products were extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% acrylamide gels. The assay was carried out as described previously (56Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated overnight with excess (1 μg) recombinant RPA proteins or E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein. The wells were then blocked by incubation for 2 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The indicated amounts of purified T Ag were added in 50-μl volumes of blocking solution for 2 h. After washing, bound T Ag was detected by Pab 419 monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution), peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution), and the chromogenic substrate 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma). DNA polymerase α stimulation reactions were carried out in 20-μl volumes containing 30 nm M13 ssDNA, 90 nm sequencing primer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.3), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmATP, 0.1 mm dATP, dGTP, TTP, and 0.025 mm dCTP (1000 cpm/pmol). DNA polymerase α was added after a 10-min preincubation period with RPA, and the reaction was continued for another 10 min in 37 °C. The incorporation of [α-32P]dCMP was determined by DE81 paper method (51Dutta A. Winchester E. Pagano M. Cell Cycle-Materials and Methods. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., NY1995: 175-185Google Scholar). DNA polymerase δ stimulation reactions were carried out in 25-μl volumes as described (57Podust V.N. Georgaki A. Strack B. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [α-32P]dCMP was determined by DE81 paper, and the products were analyzed on a 1% alkaline agarose gel. The gel was processed as mentioned above. The plasmids used were derivatives of pUC vectors, the 3.0-kb pBluescript KS+(Stratagene), and the 3.7-kb pHM14 (58Rydberg B. Spurr N. Karran P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9563-9569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pBluescript KS+was UV-irradiated (450 J/m2). Both plasmids were treated with E. coli Nth protein, and closed circular DNA was isolated from cesium chloride and sucrose gradients (59Wood R.D. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Methods. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 48 μg of human CFII fraction protein depleted of RPA and PCNA (40Shivji K.K. Kenny M.K. Wood R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), 25 ng of recombinant PCNA, 250 ng of irradiated pBluescript KS+, 250 ng of non-irradiated pHM14, 45 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 70 mm KCl, 7.4 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.4 mm EDTA, 20 μm each of dGTP, dCTP, and TTP, 8 μm dATP, 74 kBq of [α-32P]dATP (110 TBq/mmol), 2 mm ATP, 22 mm phosphocreatine (di-Tris salt), 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 3.4% glycerol, 18 μg of bovine serum albumin and were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. Plasmid DNA was purified from the reaction mixtures, linearized withBamHI, and loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Data were analyzed by autoradiography with intensifying screens, densitometry, and liquid scintillation counting of the excised bands. Covalently closed circular DNA containing a single 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG)-cisplatin cross-link (Pt-GTG) was prepared as described (60Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This DNA substrate was used to analyze the dual incision process of nucleotide excision repair which leads to the excision of characteristically sized platinated oligomers 24–32 nucleotides in length. Each 150-μl reaction mixture contained 144 μg of HeLa cell CFII fraction protein, depleted of RPA and PCNA (40Shivji K.K. Kenny M.K. Wood R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), and 4.8 μg of the indicated recombinant RPA in buffer containing 45 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 70 mm KCl, 7.4 mmMgCl2, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 22 mmphosphocreatine (di-Tris salt), 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 3.4% glycerol, and 18 μg of bovine serum albumin. After 5 min at 30 °C, either Pt-GTG DNA (750 ng) or control DNA (750 ng) without the cisplatin cross-link was added and incubation continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The DNA was purified and digested with XhoI andHindIII for 4 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding formamide buffer containing bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading on a 12% acrylamide gel and run until the blue dye migrated ∼30 cm from the wells. DNA was transferred by capillary action for 90 min onto a Hybond-N+ membrane soaked in 10 × Tris borate buffer. The membrane was fixed in 0.4 m NaOH for 20 min followed by a 2-min wash in 5 × SSC. The fixed membrane was incubated at 42 °C for 16 h in hybridization bottles containing 40 ml of 130 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, 7% SDS, 10% PEG 8000, and 100 pmol of 32P-labeled 27-mer oligonucleotide which is complementary to the excised platinated oligomers (60Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed for 10 min in 2 × SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS before exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. The mismatch-containing substrates used in these studies were constructed from derivatives of phagemid pBS-SK in which the polylinker between theApaI and BamHI sites had been replaced by different mutant polylinkers. Heteroduplex substrates were constructed and purified using unpublished procedures similar to those described by others (61Muster-Nassal C. Kolodner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The polylinker regions of the substrates used the following Sequence 1 (Sequence 1) which contains a GT mispair within overlapping XhoI and NsiI recognition sequences such that repair of the mispair can be monitored by cleavage of the product DNA with eitherXhoI or NsiI. The substrate contained a single strand break in the NsiI strand at the ScaI site (nucleotide 1106- from the mispair). Importantly, the substrates contain a unique AlwNI site 2.1 kb from the mispair. The construction of the mutant phagemids and the substrate construction methods will be described in greater detail elsewhere. The repair assay contains 50 μg of S100 extract (from 293 cells); 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.8); 7 mm MgCl2; 4 mm ATP, 200 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP; 100 μm dNTP; 40 mm creatine phosphate; 100 μg of creatine phosphokinase/ml; 15 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5); and 100 ng of the mismatch substrate (62Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-311Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 h. After the 2-h incubation, 50 μl of stop buffer (0.67% SDS; 0.025 m EDTA) and proteinase K (0.3 mg/ml final concentration) were added. After an additional 15 min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform, and the DNA was precipitated, digested with appropriate enzymes, and run on a 1.2% agarose gel at 65 V for 2.5 h. The fractionated DNA was stained by SYBR green and visualized on a fluoroimager (Molecular Dynamics). The repair results in the restoration of an XhoI or NsiI site, and the repair efficiency observed ranged from 5 to 15%. For antibody neutralization experiments, the extract was incubated with various antibodies for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of the mismatch substrate. For RPA rescue experiments, the RPA and the mismatch substrate were added simultaneously. We have previously described three human RPA complex mutants, m1–616 tRPA (two of the four cysteines in the putative zinc finger of Rpa1 (amino acid 500 and 503) are changed to serine, renamed here as RPAm), 278–616 tRPA (deletion of amino acids 1–277 of Rpa1), and Δ222–411 tRPA (deletion of amino acids 222–411 of Rpa1) (8Lin Y.L.

A complex of dystrophin and its associated proteins was fully expressed in L6 myotubes, from which anti-dystrophin or anti-α-sarcoglycan co-precipitated integrin α5β1 and other focal adhesion-associated proteins vinculin, talin, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy revealed that dystrophin, α-sarcoglycan, integrin α5β1, and vinculin exhibited overlapping distribution in the sarcolemma, especially at focal adhesion-like, spotty structures. Adhesion of cells to fibronectin- or collagen type I-coated dishes resulted in induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of α- and γ-sarcoglycans but not β-sarcoglycan. The same proteins were also tyrosine-phosphorylated when L6 cells in suspension were exposed to Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide. All of these tyrosine phosphorylations were inhibited by herbimycin A. On the other hand, treatment of L6 myotubes with α- and γ-sarcoglycan antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in complete disappearance of α- and γ-sarcoglycans and in significant reduction of levels of the associated focal adhesion proteins, which caused about 50% reduction of cell adhesion. These results indicate the existence of bidirectional communication between the dystrophin-containing complex and the integrin adhesion system in cultured L6 myocytes.

These results indicate the existence of bidirectional communication between the dystrophin-containing complex and the integrin adhesion system in cultured L6 myocytes. Several classes of cell adhesion receptors, including integrins, dystroglycan, cadherins, and members of the immunoglobulin family, are coexpressed by skeletal muscle and presumably play critical roles during skeletal muscle differentiation and development (see Ref. 1McDonald K.A. Horwitz A.F. Knudsen K.A. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 105-116Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar for review). Integrins form a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane proteins with different α and β subunits (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). The ligands of the integrins can be components of the extracellular matrix or other integral membrane proteins, such as VCAM-1. Previous studies suggest that different integrins may play specific roles in different developmental and cellular phenomena. The β1 integrin subfamily, with its different α subunits, is a major group of integrins expressed in muscle cells and has been shown to be required for myoblast differentiation and myotube formation (1McDonald K.A. Horwitz A.F. Knudsen K.A. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 105-116Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Menko A.S. Boettiger D. Cell. 1987; 51: 51-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A large number of different integrin α subunits are expressed in developing muscle cells, and some of them localize in unique functional cellular regions and seem to play distinct roles in regulation of myogenesis, although their precise functions remain to be clarified (1McDonald K.A. Horwitz A.F. Knudsen K.A. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 105-116Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4McDonald K.A. Lakonishok M. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell.

Myogenic cells associate with extracellular matrix, which is advantageous for cell terminal differentiation. The extracellular matrix-integrin interaction occurs at various cytoskeletal-sarcolemmal linkages, such as focal adhesion-like structures, myotendinous and neuromuscular junctions, and the costameres (1McDonald K.A. Horwitz A.F. Knudsen K.A. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 105-116Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4McDonald K.A. Lakonishok M. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell.

At the focal adhesions present in cultured cells, integrins cluster and associate with many cytoskeletal proteins, such as talin, vinculin, paxillin, and α-actinin, as well as FAK 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; DAP, dystrophin-associated protein; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. and other protein kinases (7Jockusch B.M.

Recent evidence indicates that assembly of the focal complex requires both the engagement of integrins with extracellular matrix and the integrin activation by intracellular signaling, although the physiological mechanism of the latter is largely unknown (9Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Integrin occupancy with ligands and clustering have been shown to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins, including FAK, paxillin, tensin, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar, 7Jockusch B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl K. Kroemker M. Moschner J. Rothkegel M. Rudiger M. Schluter K. Stanke G. Winkler J.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and other focal adhesion proteins is not required for focal adhesion formation but is important for the other integrin-induced signalings, such as control of cell growth (10Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, assembly of the focal adhesion complex can be inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (8Miyamato S. Teramoto H. Caso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J.

The integrity of the dystrophin-DAP complex seems to be essential for the viability of muscle cells, because disruption of the complex due to a defect in dystrophin or any one of the sarcoglycans has been reported to cause various forms of inherited muscular dystrophy (13Tinsley J.M.

Sarcoglycans thus seem to be functionally and pathologically as important as dystrophin. At present, however, like all other components of the dystrophin-DAP complex, little is known about the functional and structural roles of sarcoglycans, including their interaction with other cellular proteins. In our recent preliminary report (22Yoshida T. Hanada H. Iwata Y. Pan Y. Shigekawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we have presented evidence that the dystrophin-DAP complex is associated with the focal adhesion assembly proteins, such as the integrin β1 subunit, vinculin, and FAK in serum-deprived, differentiated BC3H1 cells, a nonfusing muscle cell line. We have also shown that loss of α-sarcoglycan induced by the antisense ODN treatment results in a significant inhibition of adhesion to the substrate by these cells. In this communication, we report that muscle-specific α- or γ-sarcoglycans were tyrosine-phosphorylated when differentiated rat skeletal L6 cells were adhered to the extracellular matrix. On the other hand, treatment of these cells with antisense ODN directed against α- or γ-sarcoglycan significantly decreased the associated focal adhesion proteins and concomitantly inhibited cell adhesion. The results indicate the existence of bidirectional communication between the dystrophin-DAP complex and the integrin adhesion system in these cultured cells. Monoclonal mouse antibodies against dystrophin (VIA4–2 A3, Upstate Technology Inc.), α-sarcoglycan (IVD3–1, Upstate Technology Inc.), β-dystroglycan (NCL-43DAG, Novocastra), laminin (anti-laminin monoclonal antibody, Sigma), integrin β1 (MAR4, Pharmingen), vinculin (VIN-11–5, Sigma), and phosphotyrosine (PY20, Upstate Technology Inc.) were used. Anti-FAK, anti-paxillin, anti-ezrin, and anti-cortactin monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-syntrophin monoclonal antibody SYN1351 was a gift from Dr. Stanley C. Froehner (23Froehner S.C. Murnane A.A. Tobler M. Peng H.B. Sealock R. J. Cell. Biol. 1987; 104: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against integrin α5β1 (VLA-5) and αV integrin subunit (VNR139) were purchased from Chemicon and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. Anti-actin polyclonal antibody, which recognizes all actin isoforms, was a gift from Dr. Keigi Fujiwara (24Byers H.R. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of α-sarcoglycan fused to glutathione S-transferase was prepared as described previously (25Iwata Y. Pan Y. Hanada H. Yoshida T. Shigekawa M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2501-2509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Preparation of polyclonal chicken antibodies against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino acids 92–318 of rabbit skeletal muscle β-sarcoglycan and amino acids 64–291 of rabbit skeletal muscle γ-sarcoglycan was also described (26Hanada H. Yoshida T. Pan Y. Iwata Y. Nishimura M. Shigekawa M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These chicken antibodies, which were subsequently affinity purified using glutathioneS-transferase and glutathioneS-transferase-sarcoglycan fusion proteins as described previously (27Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recognized single proteins of the expected molecular weights for respective sarcoglycans in the immunoblot assay of L6 cell lysates (see Fig. 3 B). L6 rat skeletal myoblasts (ATCC) were grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 4–5 days, ∼80% of cells were fused to form myotubes. We used these cells for all experiments in this study. For cell adhesion assay, these cells were detached from dishes by trypsinization, washed once with DMEM containing 2% FCS and twice with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA, and subsequently preincubated with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 15 min at 37 °C on a rotator. Cells (104 cells) were then plated onto dishes coated with fibronectin (4 μg/cm2), collagen (type I) (2 μg/cm2), or poly-l-lysine (3 μg/cm2) and incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated (see Fig. 4). After being washed twice with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA, attached cells were counted after staining with trypan blue. The cells referred to as “cells in suspension” were held in suspension for 30 min. In some experiments, cells in suspension were incubated with Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide (RGDS peptide; Peptide Institute, Inc.). Cells (1.5 × 106cells) were washed three times with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 9.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and lysed for 5 min with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatants were precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C and then with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The resultant immunocomplexes were washed 7–10 times with the ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer devoid of SDS and deoxycholate and finally boiled in 30 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for 5 min. The samples (100 μg/lane) were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 or 10% gel as described previously (28Tawada-Iwata Y. Imagawa T. Yoshida A. Takahashi M. Nakamura H. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1447-H1453PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, we used an immunoprecipitation buffer that was similar except for containing 0.2% SDS and omitting the Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate for immunoprecipitation and washing (see “Results”). For immunoblot analysis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes, reacted with primary and then with secondary antibodies, and subsequently visualized with the ECL immunoblotting detection system (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (28Tawada-Iwata Y. Imagawa T. Yoshida A. Takahashi M. Nakamura H. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1447-H1453PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of α-dystroglycan, laminin overlay assay was performed as described previously (29Iwata Y. Nakamura H. Mizuno Y. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The following 16-mer phosphorothioate-modified ODNs were synthesized (Sawady Technology, Inc.) and used: α-sarcoglycan antisense ODN, 5′-GTGGTCTGCTGGGCCT-3′ (nucleotides 64–79 of rat α-sarcoglycan cDNA); β-sarcoglycan antisense ODN, 5′-AGCCTTCTCCCGCATGGA -3′ (nucleotides 96–113 of rat β-sarcoglycan cDNA); γ-sarcoglycan antisense ODN, 5′- TTGGAGAAAACCACATCACTT-3′ (nucleotides 228–248 of rat γ-sarcoglycan cDNA); and control ODN with a random nucleotide sequence. After cultivation in 10% FCS for 5 days, L6 cells were treated with 300 nm antisense or control ODN in the presence of 10 μg/ml Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) but in the absence of FCS for 6 h. Cells were then washed three times with DMEM and left in DMEM containing 5% FCS and 300 nm ODN for an additional 48 h. The latter procedure was repeated to expose cells to ODN for a total of 5 days. Cells were subsequently screened for expression of α-, β-, and γ-sarcoglycans by immunoblotting. L6 cells (1 × 104cells) cultured on fibronectin-coated 60-mm plates were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After being washed three times with PBS, cells were incubated with a blocking solution (Block ACE, Dainippon Pharmaceuticals) containing 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were treated with one of the following primary antibodies for 4–6 h at 4 °C: anti-α-sarcoglycan (dilution, 1:500), anti-dystrophin (1:100), anti-integrin β1 (1:200), anti-vinculin (1:500), or anti-integrin α5β1 (1:500). After being washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, cells were incubated with either rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) (1:1000) or fluorescein-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) (1:500) for 1–3 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. For double staining with a combination of polyclonal (rabbit) and monoclonal (mouse) antibodies, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with a mixture of two primary antibodies and then with a mixture of the fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse and rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit IgGs. Cells were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 system (Bio-Rad) mounted on an Olympus BX50WI epifluorescence microscope with a plan-apochromat × 60 water immersion objective lens (Olympus). The rat L6 skeletal muscle cell line has widely been used as a model for studying myogenesis. Upon reaching subconfluency in 10% serum, L6 myoblasts spontaneously fuse with each other to form multinucleated myotubes and express skeletal muscle proteins (30Yaffe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 31Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using specific antibodies, we examined the expression and distribution of the components of the dystrophin-DAP complex in L6 cells that had been cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes for 4–5 days. The material immunoprecipitated from adherent L6 cells with anti-dystrophin contained proteins recognized by antibodies against dystrophin, β-dystroglycan, syntrophin, and α-, β-, and γ-sarcoglycans (Fig. 1 A). α-Dystroglycan was detected by laminin overlay assay. In the same immunoprecipitate, we detected the proteins reactive with antibodies raised against focal adhesion-associated proteins, such as integrin α5β1, vinculin, talin, and FAK (Fig.1 A; see also Fig. 7 B). We also detected a protein reactive with anti-paxillin (data not shown). Conversely, we found that the material immunoprecipitated with anti-integrin β1subunit contained proteins reactive with antibodies against the components of the dystrophin-DAP complex (Fig. 1 B). The fractions of focal adhesion proteins recovered from total cell lysate with anti-dystrophin were relatively small (13.2 ± 2.3, 12.1 ± 2.0, 15.5 ± 2.4, and 14.5 ± 1.9% (n = 4) for integrin α5β1, vinculin, talin, and FAK, respectively), as determined by immunoblot analysis of the proteins recovered with anti-dystrophin and those remaining in the postimmunoprecipitation supernatant. Under the conditions used, >95% of dystrophin and DAPs were solubilized into the cell lysate, and anti-dystrophin immunoprecipitated >95% of the solubilized dystrophin (data not shown). Interestingly, when L6 cells were detached from dishes and kept in suspension for 30 min, the proteins reactive with antibodies against focal adhesion proteins became undetectable or much reduced in the dystrophin immunoprecipitate, although levels of dystrophin and DAPs did not change significantly (Fig.1 A).Figure 7Effects of sarcoglycan antisense ODNs on adhesion activity of L6 cells and expression of focal adhesion-associated proteins. A, L6 cells were pretreated for 5 days with 300 nm each of random ODN (open columns) or sarcoglycan antisense ODNs (filled columns) and then replated onto fibronectin-coated dishes at a density of 104 cells in serum-free DMEM for the indicated periods of time. Cell adhesion assay were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each column represents the mean ± S.E. obtained from four independent experiments. B, lysates from cells pretreated with random ODN (AS-ODN −) or antisense ODN directed against α-sarcoglycan antisense ODN (α-SG AS-ODN +), β-sarcoglycan antisense ODN (β-SG AS-ODN +), or γ-sarcoglycan antisense ODN (γ-SG AS-ODN +) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-dystrophin followed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies against the indicated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antibodies against other cytoskeletal proteins, such as αV integrin subunit, ezrin, and cortactin, did not precipitate the components of the dystrophin-DAP complex from adherent L6 cells (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Conversely, αV integrin subunit, ezrin, and cortactin were not detected in the dystrophin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, A andC). Actin was not detected in the αV integrin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, a small amount of actin was detected in the dystrophin immunoprecipitates from adherent and nonadherent cells (Fig. 1 A). This actin appears to be one that is bound to dystrophin, because dystrophin is known to be an actin-binding protein (13Tinsley J.M. Blake D.J. Zuelling R.A. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8307-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 32Way M. Pope B. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, >80% of actin was not solubilized into cell lysates, and about 90% of the solubilized actin was present in the postimmunoprecipitation supernatant obtained with anti-dystrophin (data not shown). To obtain additional controls for these immunoprecipitation data, we carried out immunoprecipitation with anti-dystrophin using the immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.2% SDS but omitting Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate, instead of our usual buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate. When adherent cells were dissolved in this solution and immunoprecipitation and washing were performed in the same solution, recovery of proteins with protein A-Sepharose beads was reduced to about half, but anti-dystrophin or anti-αV integrin subunit was able to co-precipitate all of the proteins that were detected in the corresponding immunoprecipitates obtained using the usual immunoprecipitation buffer (see Fig. 1 A) without a resultant change in the relative abundance of each protein (data not shown). Based on all of these results, it seems likely that the dystrophin antibody did not co-precipitate very large cytoskeletal complexes, suggesting the presence of specific interaction of the dystrophin-DAP complex with focal adhesion-associated proteins. We examined localization of proteins recognized by antibodies against dystrophin, α-sarcoglycan, integrin α5β1, and vinculin in L6 cells plated on fibronectin-coated dishes by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In a cell focused at the middle portion, anti-integrin α5β1 or anti-dystrophin stained only the peripheral sarcolemma (Fig.2, A and B), whereas in a cell focused at the basal portion, spotty staining of cell area was obtained with anti-dystrophin (Fig. 2 B, arrowhead). We double-stained cells with rabbit anti-α-sarcoglycan (red) and mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin (green). In a cell focused at the basal portion, signals from both antibodies colocalized at many spotty structures (Fig. 2 D, yellow), although they clearly did not overlap at some other similar structures. These spotty structures stained with anti-vinculin may be similar to focal adhesions in fibroblasts (7Jockusch B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl K."

The amino acid sequence of deoxyhypusine synthase is highly conserved and enzymes from different species exist as homotetramers of 40 to 43-kDa subunits. In recent studies with human deoxyhypusine synthase, we have identified an active site lysine residue, Lys329, that is involved in enzyme-substrate intermediate formation (13Wolff E.C. Folk J.E.

Hypusine is ubiquitous in eukaryotes, occurring at one highly conserved residue of eIF-5A. The assignment of this protein as a putative translation initiation factor was based on its in vitroability to stimulate methionyl puromycin synthesis (14Kemper W.M. Berry K.W. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

The arrest in cell proliferation by inhibitors of polyamine biosynthetic enzymes has been attributed to depletion of eIF-5A following deprivation of spermidine (17Byers T.L. Ganem B. Pegg A.E.

The ability of spermidine analogues to support the growth of polyamine-deficient cells correlated with their competency to act as a substrate for deoxyhypusine synthesis (17Byers T.L. Ganem B.

Genet. 1993; 241: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) independently demonstrated that expression of either one of the two eIF-5A genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is vital for yeast survival. Schnier et al. further showed that a yeast mutant protein, eIF-5A precursor(K51R), which cannot be modified to the hypusine form due to the substitution of Arg51 for Lys, did not support the growth of yeast. Although suggesting the importance of the preservation of Lys51 for hypusine synthesis, these results do not provide direct evidence of the essential requirement of the hypusine modification for yeast growth. We undertook a study to determine the role of deoxyhypusine synthase in the yeast S. cerevisiae through inactivation of its gene. Our data as well as those of Sasaki et al. (8Sasaki K. Abid M.R. Miyazaki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), recently reported while this work was in progress, indicate that this gene is essential for cell viability in yeast. We extended the yDHSgene disruption studies by employing site-directed mutagenesis and plasmid shuffle techniques to compare the capabilities of wild type and mutated yDHS genes to support yeast growth. Single or double mutations were introduced into yDHS at the sites encoding Lys308 and Lys350 (corresponding to Lys287 and Lys329, respectively, of the human enzyme). Our results presented here show that the activity of deoxyhypusine synthase, as well as the gene product, is required for yeast viability and thus provide strong evidence of an essential role for eIF-5A and its hypusine modification in eukaryotic cell proliferation. Furthermore, the marked increase in the size of the cells at the cessation of growth upon depletion of deoxyhypusine synthase, and consequently of eIF-5A, invites speculation on the possible role of eIF-5A in the cell division phase of the cell cycle.

Open table in a new tab A 1.2-kb DNA fragment encompassing the whole open reading frame (ORF) (1164 bp) of yeast deoxyhypusine synthase gene (yDHS) with twoPstI sites near the 5′ and 3′ termini was prepared by PCR using yeast quick clone cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template and a primer set of D5–1 and D3–1 (Table II). After digestion with PstI, the 1.2-kb fragment was inserted into the PstI site of pUC19 to generate pYS1 (SchemeFSI A). pYS1 was digested with StyI to remove a 700-bp fragment from the middle coding region of yDHS. Into this linearized plasmid, a LEU2 marker gene (2 kb), obtained from YEp13 by digestion with HpaI and SalI, was inserted by blunt end ligation, resulting in pYLS1. A 2.5-kb DNA fragment with yDHS disrupted by LEU2 was obtained after digestion of pYLS1 with PstI and was used for transformation of S. cerevisiae strain JS10 using the lithium acetate method (26$$Google Scholar).

The yDHS gene with NdeI and BamHI sites introduced at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, of the ORF was constructed as outlined in Scheme FSI B. yDHS-U (400-bp 5′-untranslated region with SalI and NdeI sites) and yDHS-D(450-bp 3′-untranslated region with BamHI andHindIII sites) were generated by PCR of the genomic DNA ofS. cerevisiae strain JS10 using the primer sets D5–3/D3–3 and D5–4/D3–4, respectively. Since 21 bp at the 3′ terminus ofyDHS-U and the 5′ terminus of yDHS-D are complementary, the two products purified from a gel were used as templates for the second round of PCR with the primer set D5–3/D3–4 to generate yDHS-UD, a 0.85-kb fusion product. After digestion with SalI and HindIII, this PCR product was inserted into theSal I-HindIII site of pOCUS-2 to generate pOUD-1. pOUD-1 was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated with the yDHS ORF, 1.2-kbNdeI-BamHI fragment produced from pET11a-yDHS (12Kang K.R. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18408-18412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), to generate pOyDHS. The 2.1-kb SalI-HindIII fragment from pOyDHS was inserted into theSalI-HindIII site of the centromeric plasmid pRS316 to form pRS316-yDHS, or into the SmaI-SalI site of the yeast episomal plasmid YEp352T (by blunt end ligation) to generate YEp352T-yDHS. A 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment of YRp7 containingARS1 and TRP1 was inserted to theEcoRI site of pOyDHS to generate YRp7-yDHS. For the construction of plasmids expressing mutant enzymes in yeast, the 1.2-kbNdeI-BamHI fragment of the above recombinant plasmids containing wild type yDHS gene was replaced with a 1.2-kb NdeI-BamHI fragment of pET-11a recombinant plasmids harboring mutated yDHS sequences. Double mutations at Lys308 and Lys350 were carried out by PCR-directed mutagenesis (27Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The Lys codon (AAG) corresponding to amino acid residue 308 or 350 was replaced by the Arg codon (AGG), Pro codon (CCG), or Glu codon (GAA). In the first step, replacement of Lys308 with Arg was performed using primer D3–6 (TableII) containing the Arg codon in place of the Lys codon. Two PCR products obtained in the first round of PCR, using pET-11a-yDHS as the template and the primer sets D5–5/D3–6 and D5–6/D3–5, were annealed and amplified in the second round of PCR using the D5–5/D3–5 primer set to produce a full-length 1.2-kb DNA fragment. Introduction of the second mutation was carried out in a similar manner, starting with pET-11a-yDHS(K308R), as the template, and primer sets targeted to change Lys350 to Arg, Glu, or Pro. The yDHS K308R or yDHS K350R single mutation was generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with D5–8/D3–10 as the primer set for Lys308 (AAG) to Arg (CGC) substitution and D5–9/D3–11 primer set for Lys350 (AAG) to Arg (CGC) substitution. The introduction of the correct mutation was verified by sequencing of the mutated DNA after insertion into a plasmid. We and others identified YHR068w in S. cerevisiae chromosome VIII as a candidate gene for yeast deoxyhypusine synthase by searching for sequences in the GenBank data base that matched the partial amino acid sequences determined for the enzymes from rat (4Wolff E.C.

The identity of the deoxyhypusine synthase gene was verified by demonstrating enzymatic activity after expression of its ORF in E. coli (12Kang K.R. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol.

Independently, Sasaki et al.purified deoxyhypusine synthase from yeast and cloned the identical gene (8Sasaki K. Abid M.R. Miyazaki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). There appears to be a single gene for this enzyme in yeast. Hybridization of yeast genomic DNA digested with EcoRI orHindIII with the radiolabeled ORF of yDHSdisplayed one radiolabeled band in each case, of 5.83 or 3.75 kb, respectively (data not shown). Furthermore, no other sequence related to the ORF of yDHS is found in the whole genome of S. cerevisiae (28Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D.

Science. 1996; 274: 546-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3282) Google Scholar), when searched by the BLAST network service of NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). To determine whether the deoxyhypusine synthase gene is essential for cell viability in yeast, we constructed a plasmid, pYLS1, containingyDHS with the middle 60% of the ORF deleted and replaced with LEU2, as shown in SchemeFSI A. A 2.5-kb PstI fragment with disrupted yDHS was used to transform the Leu− diploid stain JS10 (Table I). Leu+transformants were selected; disruption of chromosomal yDHSby homologous recombination was confirmed by PCR. As shown in Fig.1, most Leu+ transformants carried normal yDHS on one allele and a disruptedydhs::LEU2 on the other allele. No difference in the pattern of growth and sporulation of JS10 and of the heterozygousydhs/yDHS diploids was observed, suggesting that disruption of one chromosomal allele is not detrimental in yeast cells. One such transformant, JSD1, was subjected to sporulation followed by tetrad dissection (Fig. 2 A). Only two of the four spores from each ascus grew to visible colonies (8 out of 18 dissected asci shown) (Fig. 2 A). All growing colonies were Leu−; none was Leu+, an indication that the haploid with the ydhs::LEU2 genotype is not viable. Microscopic examination of those spores unable to form visible colonies revealed that they did in fact germinate but ceased to grow after ∼eight or nine generations (Fig. 2, A andC, open arrows, 15/16 spores). After 18 h (day 1) of dissection, the ydhs null mutant showed slowed growth (30–60 cells, five or six generations) compared withyDHS wild type (200–400 cells, eight or nine generations). By the 2nd day, the yDHS spores grew to visible colonies and kept on growing on consecutive days (Fig. 2, A andC, solid arrows). In contrast, theydhs haploids stopped cell division by day 2, at a colony size of ∼300 cells of slightly enlarged size (open arrows). It is clear that from day 2 to day 3 a marked increase in cell size occurred with no change in number. No further increase in cell number or size was observed upon prolonged incubation (up to day 10). In the case of the yDHS cells, no such enlargement was seen on any day. The arrest in growth of theydhs null mutants after several cell divisions most likely results from depletion of deoxyhypusine synthase and consequently a reduction in eIF-5A below the minimum level required to support cell growth.Figure 2Tetrad dissection of JSD1 (A) and JSD1[YEp352T-yDHS] (B) and growth analysis of yDHSspore (solid arrow) and ydhs null spore (open arrow) (C). YDHS/ydhs::LEU2 strain JSD1, or JSD1 transformed with YEp352T-yDHS was sporulated, tetrads dissected, and spores seeded on a YPAD plate. At 1–7 days after seeding, colonies were photographed (original magnification, × 320) to follow their growth. One representative colony of yDHS and ydhs null spore is shown. 15/16 null spores showed a growth arrest pattern similar to that of the representative one shown (open arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data of Figs. 2 B and 3 show that plasmid-borneyDHS can complement the ydhs null mutation on the chromosome. JSD1 transformed with the centromeric plasmid pRS316-yDHS carrying URA3 and yDHS, or a high copy number episomal plasmid YEp352T-yDHS carrying TRP1 andyDHS, was sporulated and tetrads were analyzed. Unlike the 2:2 viable/non-viable segregation of JSD1, tetrads from JSD1 carrying either plasmid could yield more than two viable haploid colonies after dissection. Dissection of 16 asci derived from JSD1[pRS316-yDHS] yielded visible colonies as follows: 1 (1 ascus), 2 (10 asci), 3 (4 asci), 4 (1 ascus). Tetrads from JSD1[YEp352T-yDHS] gave rise to a higher number of viable colonies, i.e. 4 (6 asci), 3 (1 ascus), 2 (1 ascus) (Fig. 2 B). All viable Leu+haploids derived from JSD1[pRS316-yDHS] were Ura+; all Leu+ haploids from JSD1[YEp352T-yDHS] were Trp+, indicating the dependence of growth ofydhs::LEU2 haploids on the yDHS gene on the plasmids. Those spores that did not form visible colonies stopped growth after several cell divisions (similar to those shown in Fig.2 C). 18 Ura+ haploid colonies carrying pRS316-yDHS (Fig. 3 A), derived from sporulation and tetrad dissection of JSD1[pRS316-yDHS], were patched onto minimal media containing (Fig. 3 A) or lacking (Fig. 3 B) leucine. Half of the colonies were Leu+ with disrupted chromosomal yDHS and the other half Leu− with intact chromosomal yDHS. When the same colonies were patched onto minimal media containing leucine, uracil, and 5-FOA, which selects against Ura+cells, only Leu− cells grew (Fig. 3 C), indicating that they can lose the URA3 plasmid. In contrast, no Leu+ colonies could grow on 5-FOA plates, suggesting that they cannot grow without yDHS from the plasmid. Further evidence for the dependence of the ydhs null haploid on plasmid-borne yDHS for growth was obtained from comparison of plasmid retention of the Leu+ haploid JSH1[pRS316-yDHS] and the Leu− haploid JSH2[pRS316-yDHS], both derived after sporulation and tetrad dissection of JSD1[pRS316-yDHS], in rich medium. After culture of the above two haploid strains in YPAD media over 3 days, significant loss (∼90%) of the Ura+ phenotype (pRS316-yDHS plasmid) occurred for Leu− haploid containing undisruptedyDHS, but no sign of loss of the plasmid was observed for the Leu+ haploid, the ydhs::LEU2strain, suggesting the mandatory nature of yDHS for yeast survival. We next addressed the question of whether the role of theyDHS gene in cell growth is, indeed, to provide deoxyhypusine synthesis activity and thereby hypusine modification in eIF-5A. Using mutated yDHS genes, we sought to see if a correlation exists between the deoxyhypusine synthesis activity of the mutant proteins and their ability to support growth in yeast. Since two lysine residues (Lys287 and Lys329 of the human enzyme) have been identified as critical for deoxyhypusine synthase activity (13Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Lee Y.B. Park M.H. J. Biol.

The mechanisms whereby GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis are unknown. We have used mutational, biochemical, and structural data to investigate how RGS4, a GAP for heterotrimeric G protein α subunits, stimulates GTP hydrolysis. Many of the residues of RGS4 that interact with Giα1 are important for GAP activity. Furthermore, optimal GAP activity appears to require the additive effects of interactions along the RGS4-Gα interface. GAP-defective RGS4 mutants invariably were defective in binding Gα subunits in their transition state; furthermore, the apparent strengths of GAP and binding defects were correlated. Thus, none of these residues of RGS4, including asparagine 128, the only residue positioned at the active site of Giα1, is required exclusively for catalyzing GTP hydrolysis. These results and structural data (Tesmer, J. G. G., Berman, D. M., Gilman, A. G., and Sprang, S. R. (1997) Cell 89, 251–261) indicate that RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis primarily by stabilizing the transition state conformation of the switch regions of the G protein, favoring the transition state of the reactants. Therefore, although monomeric and heterotrimeric G proteins are related, their GAPs have evolved distinct mechanisms of action.

Furthermore, optimal GAP activity appears to require the additive effects of interactions along the RGS4-Gα interface. GAP-defective RGS4 mutants invariably were defective in binding Gα subunits in their transition state; furthermore, the apparent strengths of GAP and binding defects were correlated. Thus, none of these residues of RGS4, including asparagine 128, the only residue positioned at the active site of Giα1, is required exclusively for catalyzing GTP hydrolysis. These results and structural data (Tesmer, J. G. G., Berman, D. M., Gilman, A. G., and Sprang, S. R. (1997) Cell 89, 251–261) indicate that RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis primarily by stabilizing the transition state conformation of the switch regions of the G protein, favoring the transition state of the reactants. Therefore, although monomeric and heterotrimeric G proteins are related, their GAPs have evolved distinct mechanisms of action. By cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins control many biological processes, including translation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar, 2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F.

GTP hydrolysis is required to deactivate guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, as shown by the effects of hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs, or mutations and toxins that block this reaction. Because guanine nucleotide-binding proteins have slow intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis, they are acted upon by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). achieving rates of GTP hydrolysis in the physiological range (4Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). RGS (regulators of G proteinsignaling) proteins are GAPs for α subunits of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), principally Gq and members of the Gi family (5Dohlman H.G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). RGS proteins, which are unrelated in primary sequence to GAPs that act on monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins such as Ras, have been identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(Sst2p) (7Chan R.K.

In addition to acting as GAPs, certain RGS family members are capable of inhibiting signaling by binding activated (GTP-bound) Gα subunits, antagonizing effector binding (12Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Therefore, RGS family members are thought to govern the strength and duration of physiological responses triggered by an array of G protein-dependent signaling pathways. The mechanisms whereby RGS proteins, or other GAPs, stimulate GTP hydrolysis are unknown. They could introduce residues into the active sites of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, participating directly in catalyzing GTP hydrolysis as has been suggested by mutational studies of p120GAP (13Brownbridge G.G.

Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); however, proof of this mechanism requires determining the structure of Ras-p120GAPcomplexes. Alternatively, RGS proteins or other GAPs could act allosterically by stabilizing the transition state structures of the “switch” regions of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that change conformation during the GTPase cycle, stimulating intrinsic GTPase activity. Consistent with this mechanism, p120GAP and certain RGS family members bind preferentially to the transition state conformations of Ras and Gα subunits, respectively (16Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The structure of RGS4-Giα1 complexes in the transition state has recently been solved to a resolution of 2.8 Å (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The structure suggests that RGS4 could act allosterically and/or catalytically to stimulate GTP hydrolysis. An allosteric mechanism is suggested because binding of RGS4 stabilizes the switch regions of Giα1. However, a catalytic role is possible because an asparagine residue (Asn-128) of RGS4 interacts with an active-site glutamine residue (Gln-204) of Giα1 that is thought to bind or polarize the attacking water molecule in the GTPase reaction. Furthermore, modeling studies suggest that asparagine 128 of RGS4 potentially binds a water molecule when it associates with GTP-bound Giα1, earlier in the GTPase reaction mechanism (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Therefore, determining whether RGS4 acts allosterically or catalytically requires mutational and biochemical data that reveal which residues of RGS4 are required specifically to bind Gα subunits and/or catalyze GTP hydrolysis. RGS4 was expressed in yeast from theADH promoter using the polymerase chain reaction to clone the coding region of an RGS4 cDNA (rat (20Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar); rat RGS4 was used for structural studies (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar)) into pVT102U cut with BamHI andXbaI, creating pADH-RGS4. A C-terminally Myc-tagged form of RGS4 (which did not affect RGS4 function in yeast; data not shown) was generated by ligating an XbaI fragment encoding three in-frame copies of the c-Myc epitope (in pUC119; gift of D. Pellman, Whitehead Institute) with XbaI-cut pADH-RGS4, creating pADH-RGS4–3xMyc. N-terminally His-tagged RGS4 was expressed inEscherichia coli using plasmids described previously (17Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the RGS4 coding regions of yeast and E. coli expression plasmids were generated using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). N- and C-terminal truncation mutations of RGS4 were generated by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET15B (Novagen). The RGS4 coding regions of all constructs were sequenced to verify that only the desired mutations had been introduced. Pheromone response of yeast cells (BC180, ansst2 mutant) expressing wild-type and mutant forms of RGS4 was determined by performing quantitative growth arrest (halo) assays (20Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Expression of Myc-tagged RGS4 in yeast cells was examined by performing immunoblot experiments using 9E10 monoclonal antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.). N-terminally His-tagged forms of RGS4 (rat) and Goα were expressed in and purified from E. coli (BL21(DE3)) by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described previously (17Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Recombinant myristoylated Giα2 (provided by M. Linder) was purified from E. coli as described previously (21Linder M.E. Pang I.H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of G proteins were assessed by determining the stoichiometry of [35S]GTPγS binding, which was >70%. GTP hydrolysis by Gα subunits during a single catalytic turnover was determined as described previously (17Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-tagged Goα (100 nm in 400 μl) was incubated with [γ-32P]GTP (0.1 μm, 20,000–30,000 cpm/pmol) in the absence of Mg2+; stoichiometries of nucleotide binding were >70%. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed 15 s before and 45 s after hydrolysis of GTP was initiated at 5 °C by adding MgSO4 (10 mmfinal concentration), unlabeled GTP (100 μm final concentration), and either a buffer control or various amounts of wild-type or mutant forms of recombinant His-tagged RGS4. The amount of32Pi released was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding of RGS4 to Giα2 subunits was determined as described previously (17Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified myristoylated Giα2 (5 μg) was incubated with GDP, GTPγS, or GDP and AlF4−. Purified His-tagged wild-type or mutant forms of RGS4 (10 μg) were added. After a 30-min incubation on ice, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were added, incubated for 30 min with agitation at 4 °C, washed three times, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer to elute bound proteins. Eluted proteins resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to nitrocellulose; Giα2 subunits were detected by immunoblotting with antiserum P960 (Gα-common antiserum) and peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and by enhanced chemiluminescence. Images were produced using RasMol and the coordinates of the transition state structure of RGS4-Giα1 complexes (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism whereby RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis by G protein α subunits, we analyzed the effects of mutations affecting RGS4. If certain residues of RGS4 are required exclusively for catalysis, they should be dispensable for binding Gα subunits, similar to what has been shown for p120GAP (13Brownbridge G.G. Lowe P.N. Moore K.J. Skinner R.H. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10914-10919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Miao W. Eichelberger L. Baker L. Marshall M.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Alternatively, if RGS4 catalyzes GTP hydrolysis strictly by binding and stabilizing the transition state of Gα subunits, then mutations that disrupt GAP activity should invariably cause a corresponding defect in Gαbinding. Because these experiments were initiated before the structure of RGS4-Giα1 complexes was reported, our first objective was to define the minimal region of RGS4 (a 205-residue polypeptide) that possesses normal GAP activity in vitro. This domain could then be subjected to extensive point mutagenesis. Analysis of purified forms of several truncation mutants indicated that the domain characteristic of RGS family members (RGS homology domain, residues 58–177 of RGS4) had normal GAP activity toward Goα (Table I), similar to results obtained using ret-RGS-d (22Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Truncations extending into the RGS homology domain resulted in the production of RGS4 in an insoluble form (Table I), indicating a defect in protein folding or stability. The RGS homology domain of RGS4 therefore appears to be a single functional domain.Table IEffects of point mutations on GAP activity of RGS4ProteinGAP activity (Pi released relative to wild type (%))200 nm20 nmNone3 (±2)1–205100 (±4)72 (±2)13–205100 (±1)75 (±5)58–17796 (±2)74 (±6)85–205ND1-aND, not determined; protein was insoluble.1–166NDE87A,N88A3 (±1)4 (±0.5)I114D8 (±3)4 (±1)N128A4 (±2)2 (±2)L159A12 (±2)2 (±2)R167A3 (±2)3 (±3)R167H7 (±2)2 (±1)R167K6 (±2)5 (±3)E83A29 (±1)4 (±2)Y84A38 (±1)4 (±2)E87A32 (±1)5 (±2)N88A45 (±3)5 (±3)G72R79 (±7)27 (±4)F91A66 (±2)16 (±6)W92A70 (±9)12 (±4)I114A70 (±3)16 (±1)M160A85 (±2)28 (±1)D163A66 (±1)12 (±3)E64A104 (±2)81 (±5)E86A96 (±1)76 (±4)E96A96 (±2)75 (±2)E97A101 (±2)83 (±4)K99A93 (±1)61 (±3)K110A101 (±3)84 (±1)D130A87 (±1)49 (±11)F79ANDF149ANDF168AND1-a ND, not determined; protein was insoluble. Open table in a new tab To identify amino acids in RGS4 that are functionally important, we constructed a set of 43 point mutations (most of which were alanine substitutions) that affect many of the charged or conserved residues of its RGS homology domain (Fig. 1). As a means of screening rapidly for loss-of-function mutations, C-terminally Myc-tagged forms of the RGS4 mutants were tested for their ability to inhibit G protein-dependent signaling (mating pheromone response) when expressed in yeast (20Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”; results are summarized in Fig. 1). The results indicated that many of the mutants were as functional as wild-type RGS4, whereas other mutants were nonfunctional. Mutants showing an intermediate activity in this in vivo assay were not obtained, even though subsequent experiments (see below) revealed that many of the nonfunctional mutants were partially defective in GAP activity in vitro. This was expected because the in vitro assay is much more sensitive. None of the loss-of-function mutations significantly decreased expression of RGS4 in yeast, as indicated by immunoblotting (data not shown). We subsequently determined whether these loss-of-function mutations affected the stability or GAP activity of recombinant RGS4 expressed in and purified from E. coli (Table I); as controls, several mutations that did not affect RGS4 function in yeast were also analyzed. Equivalent results were obtained using either Goα or Giα2 as a substrate (data not shown). The results are interpreted below in light of the structure of RGS4-Giα1 complexes (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The RGS homology domain of RGS4 forms a bundle of nine α-helices. The binding site for Giα1 is a cleft consisting of conserved amino acids at the ends of helices 4, 7, and 8 and loops between helices 3 and 4 and helices 5 and 6. However, many other conserved amino acids in RGS4 are located distal to the Giα1-binding site. Some of these residues are important for the folding and/or stability of the RGS domain. These include a pair of phenylalanine residues (Phe-79 and Phe-168) apposed at the interface of helices 3 and 8; substituting either with alanine resulted in an insoluble protein when expressed in E. coli (data not shown). Other interacting pairs of residues may also maintain the stability or rigidity of the RGS fold because mutations affecting them resulted in soluble proteins with reduced GAP activity (Table I). These interacting residues include an isoleucine-phenylalanine pair (Ile-114 and Phe-149) apposed between helices 5 and 7, a pair of phenylalanine residues (Phe-91 and Phe-118) apposed between helices 4 and 5, and an isoleucine-tryptophan pair (Ile-67 and Trp-92) between helices 2 and 4. In contrast, two highly conserved serine residues (Ser-164 and Ser-171), which were predicted to stabilize the RGS fold by acting as helix breakers between helices 7, 8, and 9 (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), were not required for RGS4 function in vivo (Fig. 1). In remarkable agreement with structural data, the remaining loss-of-function mutations affect residues on the surface of RGS4 that interact with Giα1 (Fig.2 A and Table I). As discussed below, this indicated that many of the interactions between RGS4 and Giα1 are important for GAP activity (Fig. 2 A and Table I). Furthermore, this allowed us to investigate the relative functional importance of specific protein-protein contacts and the mechanism whereby RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis. In describing these results, we have used the convention of Tesmer et al. (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), in which residues of RGS4 are preceded with “r” and those of Giα1 with “a.” Interactions occurring at the edge of the RGS4-Giα1interface are functionally important (Fig. 2 B), as indicated by the effects of various alanine substitutions in RGS4. These include hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of r-Tyr-84 and a-His-213 and a salt bridge between r-Glu-87 and a-Lys-210. r-Glu-83 is also functionally important, probably because it interacts with the side chain of r-Arg-167 (Fig. 2 A). Potentially, this interaction pulls r-Glu-83 and the adjacent residue, r-Tyr-84, into place such that r-Tyr-84 interacts effectively with a-His-213. Alternatively, the side chain of r-Glu-83 may be important for GAP activity because it contacts the side chain of a-Val-185 (Fig.2 B). In the center of the RGS4-Giα1 interaction footprint, a-Thr-182 in switch I of the G protein binds a pocket in RGS4 consisting of several conserved residues, including r-Ser-85, r-Asn-88, r-Leu-159, r-Asp-163, r-Ser-164, and r-Arg-167 (Fig. 2 B) (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). With the exception of r-Ser-85 and r-Ser-164, the side chains of residues forming the pocket are functionally important because an alanine substitution at each site diminished the GAP activity of RGS4 (Table I). Based on these results and the structural data of Tesmer et al. (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), we propose the following roles for residues forming the pocket that binds a-Thr-182. Three residues of the pocket are important because they interact directly with a-Thr-182. The bulky side chain of r-Leu-159 may determine the size or shape of the pocket because it interacts extensively with the side chain of a-Thr-182 (Fig. 2,B and C) and because the r-L159A substitution causes a severe defect in GAP activity. Furthermore, the side chain of r-Leu-159 may be of critical importance because it also participates in a hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of a-Lys-180 (Fig. 2,B and C). The side chains of r-Asn-88 and r-Asp-163 appear to be important because they form hydrogen bonds with the side chain hydroxyl and backbone nitrogen of a-Thr-182, respectively. Although r-Ser-85 and r-Ser-164 form part of the pocket that binds a-Thr-182, their side chain hydroxyl groups are unimportant because alanine substitutions at these sites did not affect RGS4 function in vivo (Fig. 1). However, this does not exclude the possibility that the β-carbon atoms of r-Ser-85 and/or r-Ser-164 that do interact with a-Thr-182 are functionally important. Residues forming the pocket, but which do not interact extensively with a-Thr-182, are also functionally important, but probably for different reasons. r-Met-160, which lies at the floor of the pocket but does not contact a-Thr-182, may be important because its side chain interacts with that of r-Asn-88 (Fig. 2 D), potentially orienting it toward a-Thr-182. Similarly, because r-Arg-167 does not contact a-Thr-182 extensively (their side chains are a minimum of 3.9 Å apart), its principal function may be to stabilize two parts of the RGS4 surface such that each can interact with Giα1. This is suggested because 1) the side chain of r-Arg-167 interacts with side chain carboxyl groups of r-Glu-83 and r-Asp-163 (Fig. 2 B), both of which are important for GAP activity; 2) an alanine substitution of r-Arg-167 leads to a stronger defect than an alanine substitution affecting either r-Glu-83 or r-Asp-163 (Table I); and 3) changing r-Arg-167 to alanine, lysine, or histidine disrupted GAP activity (Table I). There also was evidence that normal function of RGS4 requires the additive effects of two sites that bind different regions of Giα1. r-Glu-87 and r-Asn-88, which are adjacent to one another, are likely to function cooperatively because they interact with a-Lys-210 of switch II and a-Thr-182 of switch I, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with this hypothesis, a double mutant in which r-Glu-87 and r-Asn-88 are changed to alanine had a much stronger defect in GAP activity than either single mutation (TableI). A cluster of residues in Giα1 (including a-Lys-180 of switch I and a-Gln-204, a-Ser-206, and a-Glu-207 of switch II) cradles r-Asn-128 (Fig. 2, E and F). This structural arrangement has suggested that r-Asn-128 does the following: 1) facilitates GTP hydrolysis by orienting and/or polarizing the side chain of a-Gln-204, which interacts with the attacking water molecule in the transition state; 2) binds a water molecule early in the GTPase mechanism, before the transition state is reached; and/or 3) binds and stabilizes switches I and II (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that r-Asn-128 has a pivotal role because replacing it with alanine resulted in essentially a complete loss of GAP activity (Table I). To investigate the mechanism of RGS4-stimulated GTPase activity, we determined whether the panel of GAP-defective RGS4 mutants can bind Gα subunits in their active (GTP-bound) or transition state (GDP + AlF4−) conformations. Strikingly, we found that all of the GAP-defective RGS4 mutants were impaired in their ability to bind Gαsubunits. RGS4 mutants lacking appreciable GAP activity, including r-N128A, were unable to bind activated (GTP-bound) Goαsubunits because at high concentration (3 μm), they failed to block the ability of wild-type RGS4 (10 nm) to stimulate GTP hydrolysis (Fig.3 A). Similarly, RGS4 mutants displaying various defects in GAP activity were also defective in binding Giα2 in its transition state (GDP + AlF4−) (Fig. 3 B). The results of the binding assays, although somewhat qualitative, suggested that the severity of the defects in Gα binding and GAP activity were correlated. Mutations that severely reduced or eliminated GAP activity (E87A,N88A double mutant, I114D, N128A, L159A, and R167A) appeared to cause severe defects in binding (binding was not detected) (Fig. 3 B, third row), whereas those that partially disrupted GAP activity caused less severe binding defects (binding was less efficient than with wild-type RGS4) (Fig.3 B, first and second rows; 10% of the bound material was analyzed for each mutant in the first rowand 20% for those in the second and third rows). Because all of these mutations disrupted or impaired the binding of RGS4 to Gα subunits, none of the residues they affect, including r-Asn-128, is required exclusively to catalyze GTP hydrolysis. Our functional analysis of RGS4 mutants and the structural data of Tesmeret al. (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) lead to the following conclusions regarding the mechanism whereby RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Gαsubunits. First, a principal function of asparagine 128 of RGS4 is to bind and stabilize switches I and II of Gα subunits, contributing to the overall stability of the RGS4-Gαtransition state complex. High affinity binding of RGS4 and Giα1 may not require a hydrogen bond formed by the amide nitrogen of r-Asn-128 and the carbonyl oxygen of the side chain of a-Gln-204 because in several other RGS proteins, including GAIP, r-Asn-128 is replaced by a serine residue. Therefore, interactions between r-Asn-128 and a-Lys-180, a-Ser-206, or a-Glu-207 may be important for stabilizing RGS4-Gα complexes. Indeed, a-Glu-207 of Giα1, which is highly conserved in Gα subunits, is critical for RGS binding and RGS4-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (18Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), but it is dispensable for intrinsic GTPase activity and effector recognition. Second, our finding that GAP-defective RGS4 mutants are defective in binding Gα subunits provides direct evidence in support of the hypothesis of Tesmer et al. (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) that RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis primarily, if not exclusively, by binding and stabilizing the transition state conformation of Gαsubunits. Apparently, the rigidity or stability of RGS4 is important for the mechanism because we found that pairs of interacting conserved residues distal to the Giα1-binding site of RGS4 are important for GAP activity. Furthermore, the mechanism appears to involve the additive effects of several binding interactions along the RGS4-Gα interface, as indicated by the analysis of double mutants. Thus, structural and functional data indicate that RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis by binding the switch regions of Gα subunits, creating a rigid environment that favors the transition state of the reactants. Finally, the mechanism used by RGS4 to stimulate GTP hydrolysis is different in certain respects from that used by p120GAP. Binding of p120GAP is believed to introduce one or two invariant arginine residues into the active site of Ras (13Brownbridge G.G. Lowe P.N. Moore K.J. Skinner R.H. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10914-10919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Miao W. Eichelberger L. Baker L. Marshall M.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One of these conserved arginine residues, which are required for GAP activity but are dispensable for binding of p120GAP to Ras, is thought to stabilize the developing negative charge of the γ-phosphate during GTP hydrolysis, a role subserved by a-Arg-178 in Giα1 (24Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Direct support of this conclusion has been provided recently from the crystal structure of p120GAPbound to Ras (25Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). However, a common feature of p120GAP and RGS4 is that they both stabilize the structures of the switch regions of their cognate GTP-binding proteins in the transition state (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 25Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A.

Therefore, although monomeric and heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are evolutionarily related, their attendant GAPs are distinct in terms of their sequences, structures, and mechanisms of stimulating GTP hydrolysis.

Recently, two putative receptors for LPA have been identified, suggesting that functionally different LPA receptors may exist that dictate the particular cellular response of LPA (16Hecht J.H.

Most cell types respond to LPA, making it difficult to characterize the receptor dependence of a particular response to LPA since the response cannot be solely attributed to a single LPA receptor. In particular, it is difficult to assess ligand binding specificity of an LPA receptor because other lipid receptors may exist with overlapping ligand specificity. We have therefore used the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae to study the human LPA receptor Edg-2 (also called Vzg-1). S. cerevisiae contains no endogenous LPA receptors and is therefore a potentially useful organism in which to functionally express LPA receptors and analyze their ligand specificity. Other mammalian receptors have been functionally expressed in S. cerevisiae including the somatostatin receptor, the A2a adenosine receptor and the β2-adrenergic receptor (20Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M.

S. cerevisiae contains a heterotrimeric G-protein that is activated by mating factor binding to a specific receptor (23Blumer K.J. Reneke J.E. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10836-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 24Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by an occupied receptor, the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein (Gα, theGPA1 gene product; Ref. 25Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) becomes bound to GTP and dissociates from the βγ dimer (26Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai I. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In yeast, it is the βγ dimer that transduces the signal to Ste11 (the MEKK equivalent; Ref.27Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L.

The active GTP-bound Gα is inactivated by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP at which time, Gα can reassociate with Gβγ and attenuate the signal (25Dietzel C. Kurjan J.

Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The yeast MAP kinases, Fus3 and Kss1, activate a transcriptional activator, the STE12 gene product (31Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 4: 495-510Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Activated Ste12 in turn activates the transcription of several mating factor-inducible genes such as FUS1 (32Elion E.A. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To study the Edg-2 receptor using the yeast G-protein/MAP kinase system, a strain was used that has a mutation in the FAR1 gene. This mutation has the effect of uncoupling the MAP kinase cascade from cell cycle arrest, allowing the yeast to continue growing during MAP kinase activation (33Peter M. Gartner A. Horecka J. Ammerer G. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1993; 73: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 34Peter M. Herskowitz I. Science. 1994; 265: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The strain used also contains the bacteriallacZ gene fused to the mating pheromone-inducible promoter from the FUS1 gene, which allows quantification of the receptor-ligand interaction. We mutationally inactivatedSST2 gene in this strain to increase the sensitivity of the strain to G-protein activation. The SST2 gene encodes a GTPase-activating protein for the Gα subunit (35Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By inactivating the SST2 gene product, Gα remains in the GTP-bound state longer and thus increases the steady-state concentration of the signal transducing βγ dimer. In this report, we show that Edg-2 expressed in yeast efficiently couples to the endogenous heterotrimeric G-protein in response to LPA. Edg-2 does not respond to other lyso-glycerophospholipids or to diacyl-glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidic acid or to sphingosine 1-phosphate, two phospholipids reported to share receptors with LPA in certain cell types (36Zhou D.

Ruan F. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The results are consistent with Edg-2 being a functional, specific LPA receptor. SY2069 (Mat a , far1-bad3, HIS3:: pFUS1::HIS3, mfa2-Δ1::pFUS1::lacZ, ura3, leu2, ade1, arg4, trp1; a gift from Mathais Peter and Ira Herskowitz, University of California, San Francisco) was used to derive ansst2 − strain for subsequent studies. SST2 was disrupted using pBC14 (35Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by C. Steffan and K. Blumer, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). pBC14 was digested withNcoI and transformed into SY2069 by lithium acetate using the URA3 gene for selection. Ura+ colonies were grown in nonselective medium (YEPD) and plated onto medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA, Sigma). 5-FOA is metabolized by theURA3 gene product into a toxic metabolite, thus only phenotypically Ura3− cells can grow in the presence of 5-FOA (35Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5-FOA-resistant isolates were screened for increased sensitivity to α-factor (see below). One suchsst2 − strain was named JEY5 and used in all subsequent studies. Yeast were grown in SC + 2% galactose or 2% glucose medium lacking uracil to maintain selection of the plasmid. The Edg-2 coding region was amplified by RT-PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase under conditions described by the supplier (Stratagene). The template for RT-PCR was cDNA (5 ng) that was reverse transcribed from human fetal brain total RNA (CLONTECH) using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase as described by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 μm each of the following primers: FP, 5′-GCGATAGGATCCATCATGGCTGCCATCTCTACTTC-3′, and RP, 5′-GCGATACTCGAGCTAAACCACAGAGTGATCATTGC-3′, were used for RT-PCR. The primers were designed based on the human edg-2 cDNA sequence submitted to GenBank by Zondag and Moolenaar (accession no.Y09479) and included restriction site extensions for subcloning into the pYEUra3 vector (Stratagene). This placed the cDNA under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter (UASgal). The resulting plasmid was used to transform JEY5 by the lithium acetate method. RT-PCR primers and DNA sequencing primers were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method with an Applied Biosystems model 394 synthesizer, purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and desalted on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Theedg-2 cDNA was sequenced in pYEUra3 by the dideoxy chain termination method using the T7 Sequenase 7-deaza-dGTP sequencing kit as described by the supplier (Amersham Life Science). JEY5+pJE15 was grown on SC medium containing either 2% galactose or 2% glucose lacking uracil to an approximate optical density of 0.1–0.5 before the addition of lipid or α-factor. LPA and other glycerophospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) were dissolved in chloroform and dried down under argon immediately before experiments and resuspended in BBS/EDTA (50 mm NH4HCO3, 104 mmNaCl, 250 μm EDTA·2Na, pH 7.63) at 20 mmwith sonication until the solution was clear. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (Matreya) was resuspended in ethanol/water (9:1) pH 3.0 immediately before use. Cyclic LPA and ether-linked forms of LPA were synthesized in G. Tigyi's laboratory. 2K.

Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was obtained from Sigma and used at 0.1 mg/ml in BBS/EDTA. Cells were grown for the indicated time (7 h for dose-response experiments) before assaying. 100 μl of yeast culture were then added to 900 μl of assay buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0, plus 270 μl of β-mercaptoethanol/liter) plus 50 μl of 0.1% SDS + three drops of chloroform. Cells were vortexed for 10 s and incubated for 5 min at 28 °C. 200 μl of 4 mg/mlo-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min at 28 °C. The assay was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 1 mNa2CO3. Color development was measured atA 420 and normalized toA 600. Units were expressed as Miller units. Yeast contain multiple MAP kinase cascades that are functionally analogous to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in mammalian systems (38Brewster J.L. Valoir T.D. Dwyer N.C. Winter E.

A schematic of the S. cerevisiae pheromone response pathway and the relevant genetic components are shown in Fig. 1. The parental yeast strain, SY2069, contains the FUS1 promoter fused to lacZ and HIS3 integrated into different chromosomal loci and carries a far1 − allele. The FAR1 gene product is required for cell cycle arrest after exposure to mating pheromone (see Fig. 1). By mutating this gene, the cells are able to grow in the presence of activated MAP kinase. In addition, a null mutation in the SST2 gene was created (see “Materials and Methods”) because it has been previously reported that the somatostatin receptor can efficiently couple to the endogenous yeast heterotrimeric G-protein after mutationally inactivating theSST2 gene (20Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We created a null allele in theSST2 gene using pBC14 (see “Materials and Methods” for detailed description of the null allele construction) and tested the resultant strains for the supersensitive phenotype by assayinglacZ activity in response to α-factor (data not shown). One sst2 − strain was named JEY5 and used in subsequent experiments. The edg-2 gene was expressed in either SY2069 or JEY5 under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter (UASGAL) in the shuttle vector pYEUra3 (CLONTECH). To test the effects of the SST2 gene product on the Edg-2 response to LPA, JEY5 (sst2Δ) expressing the Edg-2 receptor was compared with the parental SY2069 strain (SST2 +). Fig. 2shows that the SST2 + strain was unresponsive to LPA, whereas the sst2 − derivative was activated by 200 μm LPA. This implies that activation ofFUS1::lacZ by LPA is dependent on G-protein coupling because a G-protein-independent activation ofFUS1::lacZ would not be effected bySST2. Since antibodies specific to the Edg-2 receptor are currently unavailable, the levels of Edg-2 protein expression were not determined. However, as a control, JEY5+Edg-2 was assayed in 2% glucose. Under these conditions, the GAL1 promoter would be glucose-repressed and not express the edg-2 gene (for review on glucose repression, see Ref. 42Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). On glucose, JEY5+Edg-2 cells did not respond to LPA, suggesting that the response was dependent on the receptor expression (see Fig. 2). To further characterize the LPA response to Edg-2, the time and dose dependence of LPA activation was tested. As seen in Fig. 3 A, LPA resulted in a time-dependent increase inlacZ activity as compared with vector control with a maximal 4-fold stimulation of activity at 7 h. The dose response of Edg-2 to LPA is shown in Fig. 3 B (EC 50 = 20–30 μm). LPA concentrations above 600 μmcould not be tested due to toxicity. However, the dose-response curve can be seen to plateau, suggesting that maximal activity has been reached. The kinetics of FUS1::lacZ induction by LPA and α-factor were compared in Fig. 3 C. As seen, both LPA and α-factor continued to induce lacZ activity over the time course tested, although α-factor gave a much more robust response at a much lower concentration, suggesting the Edg-2 receptor simply does not couple to the endogenous G-protein as well as the α-factor receptor (the STE2 gene product).Figure 3LPA stimulates FUS1::lacZactivity in cells expressing Edg-2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A, yeast cells carryingedg-2 (▪) or empty vector (♦) were grown in SC + 2% galactose ± 200 μm LPA for the indicated time before assaying β-galactosidase (lacZ) activity.B, yeast cells carrying edg-2 were grown for 7 h at the indicated dose of LPA. Values are means ± S.D. of a single experiment. Similar results were obtained in at least three separate experiments.

Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), -serine (LPS), -glycerol (LPG) and -choline (LPC) and sphingosine 1-phosphate were tested over the same dose range as LPA for activation of FUS1::lacZ. As shown in Fig. 4 A, no other lyso-glycerophospholipids or sphingosine 1-phosphate activatedFUS1::lacZ as well as LPA at concentrations up to 200 μm, the highest concentration tested due to toxicity. The results of a similar experiment testing the effects of the diacyl-glycerophospholipids is seen in Fig. 4 B. In this experiment, no diacyl-glycerophospholipid activated Edg-2. Since Edg-2 appears to show specificity for LPA, the dependence of the acyl-chain length on Edg-2 activation was investigated. Five forms of LPA that varied in chain length and degree of saturation were tested: 18:1 (oleoyl), 18:0 (stearoyl), 16:0 (palmitoyl), 10:0 (capryl), and 6:0 (caproyl). Fig.5 A shows that forms of LPA with chain length of 16 carbons and greater activated Edg-2 but with a preference to the 18:1 (oleoyl) form. The shorter 10:0 and 6:0 forms were inactive. Two structural analogs of LPA were then tested: an 18:1 and a 16:0 2,3-cyclic phosphate form (cLPA) and an 18:1 ether-linked form. cLPA is a stable intermediate of phospholipase D metabolism and may have biological activities distinct from LPA (43Freidman P. Haimovitz R. Markman O. Roberts M.F. Shinitzky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 953-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 5 B shows that cLPA activatesFUS1::lacZ with similar potency to LPA, whereas ether-linked 18:1 LPA was slightly less active than the 18:1 cyclic and ester-linked forms. As with the 18:1 forms, the 16:0 ester and cyclic forms were equally active although less active than the 18:1 forms, probably due to solubility. In this report, we show that the edg-2 gene product, a putative LPA receptor also reported as vzg-1, couples to the yeast heterotrimeric G-protein and activates a MAP kinase when bound to LPA. The response to LPA was quantitated by using the lacZgene fused to the FUS1 promoter, a mating pheromone-inducible gene promoter. The yeast strain used in this report was able to grow in the presence of activated G-protein due to a mutation in the FAR1 gene. This mutation has the phenotypic effect of uncoupling G-protein/MAP kinase activation from cell cycle arrest. The response to LPA is dose- and time-dependent and requires that the SST2 gene be mutationally inactivated.SST2 encodes a GTPase-activating protein for theGPA1 gene product, the Gα subunit required for mating pheromone signal transduction. The effect of inactivatingSST2 is that Gpa1 remains in the GTP-bound state longer and thus permits signaling through the βγ dimer to proceed at a higher rate, resulting in a higher signal from the receptor. The response of Edg-2 to LPA in this yeast-based assay is markedly reduced compared with the LPA response in mammalian cells. Our results show that LPA activate FUS1::lacZ with anEC 50 of 20–30 μm. In mammalian systems, 1 μm LPA is sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and depolarize membranes in Rat-1 fibroblasts (6Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. Corven E.J.V. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2388-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is most likely due to receptor/G-protein coupling as suggested in Fig. 3 C. It may be possible to increase the response by using a mammalian Gαi subunit or a Gpa1/Gαi chimera expressed in place of the endogenousGPA1 gene product (20Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the response of theFUS1::lacZ reported is specific to cells expressing the Edg-2 receptor as yeast expressing other related receptors such as Edg-1, Edg-3, and H218 as well as the unrelated LPA receptor, PSP24, did not respond to LPA (data not shown). This yeast cell-based assay for Edg-2 was used to determine the agonist specificity of the receptor for different forms of LPA as well as other glycerophospholipids. The advantage of this system is that yeast contain few G-protein-coupled receptors. It is therefore a simple task to show that the response of the Edg-2 receptor to a particular phospholipid is dependent on the expression of the receptor, since it is expressed from a galactose inducible promoter. This is in contrast to mammalian cells in which the identity and distribution of LPA and other glycerophospholipids receptors is unclear. Our results show that Edg-2 specifically responds to LPA. Edg-2 does not respond to other lyso-glycerophospholipids or to diacyl-glycerophospholipids, in particular phosphatidic acid or to the related lipid messenger sphingosine 1-phosphate. These results are consistent with the response of neocortical neuroblasts, which express the Edg-2 receptor and do not respond to LPC, LPE, LPG, or phosphatidic acid (16Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In platelets, LPA shares a surface receptor with sphingosine 1-phosphate (37Yatomi Y. Yamamura S. Ruan F. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and, in human monocytes, phosphatidic acid and LPA both act as chemoattractants and cross-desensitize one another, suggesting that they act through a common receptor (36Zhou D. Luini W. Bernasconi S. Diomede L. Salmona M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25549-25556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on the result of our assay, neither of these effects are mediated by the Edg-2 receptor. Other results show that the acyl-chain length does have an effect on the ability of LPA to activate FUS1::lacZ. It is most likely that the short chain forms of LPA do not bind to the receptor as, in competition experiments, the 6:0 caproyl form did not attenuate the ability of the 18:1 oleoyl form to activateFUS1::lacZ (data not shown). A cyclic phosphoester form of LPA activated FUS1::lacZ as well as ester-linked LPA, whereas an ether-linked form was less active. Interestingly, in A431 cells, the ether-linked LPA was less potent at activating calcium mobilization than was the corresponding ester-linked form (44Janlink K Hengeveld T. Mulder S. Postma F.R.

Our results demonstrate that expression of Edg-2 in yeast faithfully reconstitutes many of the key properties of an LPA receptor. We conclude that Edg-2 encodes an LPA receptor. This yeast cell-based system should prove useful for studying LPA analogs as well as identifying novel agonists and antagonists of this LPA receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2076544187,"A novel, p125FAK homologue, CADTK, has been detected in neural, epithelial, or hematopoietic cells but not in fibroblasts. We now demonstrate CADTK expression in a mesenchymal cell, rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RSMC). Angiotensin II (Ang II) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB and PDGF-AA) markedly stimulated CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation in RSMC but did not affect p125FAK phosphorylation. The PDGF-dependent CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation was slower and more prolonged than that of Ang II, correlating well with the differential effects of these agonists on cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+] i ) signaling. An intracellular calcium chelator inhibited both the rapid and sustained activation of CADTK by Ang II and PDGF. Extracellular calcium chelation inhibited the PDGF-stimulated increase in CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the sustained (but not the early) activation by Ang II. In contrast, p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal in quiescent, adherent RSMC and was not affected by incubation with EGTA. Depletion of protein kinase C activity partially inhibited both the Ang II- and PDGF-induced CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation. Additional results confirm a relation between CADTK and the cytoskeleton. First, the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin correlated with activation of CADTK; this increase was inhibited by EGTA. Second, cytochalasin D blocked the PDGF- or Ang II-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CADTK, suggesting a role for the cytoskeleton in agonist-dependent CADTK activation. Third, immunofluorescence analysis of CADTK localization demonstrated actin-like cytoskeleton staining extending into focal contacts. These results suggest that in mesenchymal cells, CADTK is localized to and activated by an actin cytoskeleton-dependent mechanism; a mechanism that is regulated in a calcium and protein kinase C-dependent manner independently of p125FAK."

In eukaryotes, the reversible phosphorylation of proteins catalyzed by protein kinases and protein phosphatases determines the biological activities of many proteins and is recognized as a major mechanism controlling cellular processes as diverse as cell cycle progression, metabolism, gene expression, and phototransduction.

The known PPases can also be classified based on their sensitivities to several natural toxins (25Cohen P.

In contrast, PP2B is relatively resistant to the known inhibitors (okadaic acid, microcystin, nodularin, tautomycin, cantharidin, and calyculin A), and PP2C is insensitive to these compounds (4Walter G.

In addition, both PP2B and PP2C have an absolute requirement for divalent cations, which are not required by PP1, PP2A, PP4, or PP5. PP2C activity has an absolute requirement for Mg2+, and PP2B is activated by the association of a calcium-bound calmodulin complex (1Cohen P. Annu. Rev.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 207-226PubMed Google Scholar). PP6 has not yet been characterized biochemically. Several studies suggest that the expression of certain PPases, particularly isoforms of PP1, are altered in human tumor cells (31Saadat M. Mizuno Y. Takizawa N. Kakinoki Y. Rikuchi R. Cancer Lett. 1995; 94: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Sogawa K. Yamada T. Oka S. Kawasaki K. Mori S. Tanaka H. Norimatsu H. Cai Y. Kuwabara H. Shima H. Nagao M. Matsumoto K.

Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the heterogeneity of related PPases in Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells for comparison with those contained in normal human retina. In the course of these studies, we identified a novel human PPase that is directly activated by calcium and dependent on Mg2+ for activity. First strand human retinal cDNA was generously provided by Dr. S. Pittler and Dr. M. Ardell. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers matching to highly conserved regions of known PPases (RGNHE, DILWSDP, GDY/FVDR) were synthesized and employed in combination with an oligo(dT)15 primer to amplify human first-strand cDNA produced from human retina, Y-79 cells, and bovine brain by PCR. PCR reactions were allowed to proceed for 35 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 45 s each at 40 and 45 °C; 1 min at 72 °C) in a solution containing 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 100 ng of each primer. The PCR products produced were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ∼125 bands were isolated and cloned into pT7/T3α-18 or pBluescript for sequence analysis. The PCR products were sequenced, and the sequences obtained were searched for homologous regions contained in known PPases. The expressed sequence tag data base was also searched for homologous sequences. One sequence identifying a human cDNA clone isolated from fetal brain (GenBankTM accession numberH18854) was homologous to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C gene product (rdgC). The human brain clone (ID51064) was obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville AL), and sequence analysis of this clone confirmed the similarity withrdgC (37.4%). A ∼600-bp HindIII digest fragment from clone 51064 was radiolabeled (DECAprime IITM, Ambion) and used as a probe to screen ∼4 × 106clones from a human retina cDNA library constructed in λgt10. Four positive clones were isolated and completely sequenced. The full-length PP7 open reading frame was amplified with PCR employing a nested primer pair, (RH108, 5′-AACTCTGCAGTTAGCCAAGGTTGGTGACATCAGG-3′, and RH112, 5′-AGCCGGATCCATGGGATGCAGCAGTTCTTC-3′), which contained restriction sites (BamHI and PstI) added to the 5′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was then digested withBamHI/PstI and ligated into a baculovirus transfer vector, pFastBacTMHTb (Life Technologies, Inc.). The construct adds six consecutive His+ residues to the N-terminal region of PP7 to aid in the purification of the recombinant enzyme. After sequencing the insert, to confirm the fidelity of the construct, the recombinant plasmid was used to transformEscherichia coli (DH10Bac) containing a helper plasmid and bacmid. Recombinant bacmids were identified by the color phenotypes of the host E. coli colonies growing on Blue-gal plates (i.e. white color). Further confirmation was obtained by PCR analysis with PP7-specific primers. Approximately 5 μg of bacmid DNA was then purified and used to transfect CellFECTIN® (Life Technologies)-treated SF21 cells. Recombinant baculovirus (∼9 × 105) was harvested 72 h later, and the initial stock was reamplified and used to infect three 125-mm flasks of SF21 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Cells were harvested 48 h after the infection, collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, sonicated in a binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 400,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was then passed over a Ni+-charged chelating His-tag column (Novagene). The column was washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer and then with 6 volumes of washing buffer (60Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Hakes D.J. Barford D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17754-17761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The recombinant PP7 was then eluted with the addition of 3 column volumes of elution buffer (1m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl pH 7.9). Fractions containing PPase activity were pooled and concentrated and subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Superose 12 high resolution 10/30 column equilibrated with binding buffer. The active fractions were identified by absorbance at 280 nm and confirmed by assaying for PPase activity. Active fractions were then pooled and subjected to a second round of affinity purification employing a Ni+-charged chelating His-tag column as described above. The purity of the active fractions obtained were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Total RNA from Y-79 cell cultures or human retina was prepared using TRI reagent according to the methods of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was obtained by affinity chromatography with an oligo(dT) spin column (Poly(A) spinTM mRNA isolation kit; New England Biolabs). Poly(A)+ RNA was separated on formaldehyde-agarose (1.2%) gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (Duralon-UV, Stratagene). The RNA was fixed to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation (UV cross-linker; Stratagene). Northern blots containing 2 μg of Poly(A)+ RNA from eight different human tissues was also purchased from CLONTECH((Palo Alto, CA; MTN Blots). The full-length coding region of human PP7 was amplified by PCR and random-radiolabeled with [32P]dATP using a DECAprime IITM labeling kit (Ambion). The radiolabeled PCR product was then employed as a probe to detect the expression of PP7 mRNA. A human multiple tissue cDNA (MTCTM) panel containing prenormalized cDNAs from eight different tissues was purchased from CLONTECH). cDNA from human retina and Y-79 cells was produced from the appropriate mRNA (Y-79 mRNA was prepared as described above (Northern blot analysis), and human retina mRNA was purchased fromCLONTECH) by incubating 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in a solution (20 μl total volume) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTP mix, 100 ng of random primer, and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 50 min. After normalizing the concentration of Y-79 and human retina cDNA to that of the other tissues, 5 μl aliquots from each tissue type was employed as template in PCR reactions containing PP7 or GAPDH-specific primer pairs. The PCR reactions were carried out in a volume of 25 μl that contained 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, 100 ng each of the primers, and 25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) on a PTC-100 programmable thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc.). The reaction mixture was denatured at 94 °C for 5 min, and the amplification reaction consisted of 25 (for GAPDH) or 38 (for PP7) cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 50 s), and extension (72 °C, 2 min) with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The sequences for PP7 and GAPDH-specific primers pairs were 5′-CAGAGCATGAATGGGAACAGA-3′ and 5′-ACATGGCACGAAATTCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′, respectively. The PCR products were then resolved on a 2% agarose gel. The activity of PP7 was assessed against [32P]phosphorylase a, [32P]phosphohistone, and pNPP. Phosphohistone and phosphorylase a were prepared as described by Honkanenet al. (34Honkanen R.E. Dukelow M. Moore R.E. Zwiller J. Khatra B.S. Boynton A.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar) and assayed as described by Critz and Honkanen (35Critz S.D. Honkanen R.E. Neuroprotocols. 1995; 6: 78-83Google Scholar). pNPP activity was measured at 30 °C and determined from the change in absorbance (A 410). Reactions were conducted in a final volume of 150 μl as described previously (30Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,34Honkanen R.E. Dukelow M. Moore R.E. Zwiller J. Khatra B.S. Boynton A.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 (or as indicated), 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 20 μm pNPP, and the indicated concentrations of Ca2+. Reactions rates were determined using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer over a 15-min period using ∼0.5–2.0 μg of PP7. With both pNPP and phosphohistone, the concentrations of enzymes were adjusted to ensure that the dephosphorylation of substrate was <10% total available substrate, and the reaction was linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time. A human leukocyte genomic library constructed in λ EMBL-3 (CLONTECH) was screened using a [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probe complementary to ∼200 bp of the C-terminal region of PP7 (bp 1998–2220). Phage DNA from λ clones that hybridized with the PP7 cDNA probe were then isolated using a Wizard λ DNA purification system (Promega) according to the method of the manufacturer. Sequence analysis of one positive clone revealed that it contains a complete exon encoding a portion of the C-terminal region of PP7. PCR with nested primers contained in this exon (5-GGAAGAATTTCGTGCCATGT-3, sense, nucleotides 1999–2018; and 5-TTAGCCAAGGTTGGTGACATCAGG-3, antisense, nucleotides 2173–2196) amplifies a 199-bp intronless fragment of PP7 from human genomic DNA that is not amplified in rodent DNA. PCR analysis of a panel of human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs (National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel 2, Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) was then employed to determine the chromosomal localization of PP7. Each 25-μl PCR reaction contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm dNTP, 100 ng of each primer, 25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 100 ng of template DNA. DNA amplification was performed on a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer 2400) with 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), with an initial denaturation (95 °C, 5 min) and a final extension (72 °C, 10 min). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gels. The same primers and PCR conditions were used to amplify PP7 from a panel of radiation hybrid DNAs that contain different portions of chromosome X (NIGMS regional mapping panel for chromosome X, Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ). In an effort to characterize the PPase expressed in Y-79 retinoblastoma cells, several degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to highly conserved regions of known PPases were constructed in the sense orientation. These primers were then employed in combination with oligo(dT)15 antisense primers to amplify first-strand cDNA produced from human retina or Y-79 cell RNA employing essentially the same strategy developed by Wadzinski et al. (36Wadzinski B.E. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products from ∼200 reactions yielded numerous bands of different sizes, and ∼125 were purified and ligated into pT7/T3α-18 or pBluescript. Systematic sequencing of these clones resulted in the identification of PP1α, PP1β, PP1γ1, PP1γ2, PP2Aα, PP4, PP5, PP6 and several unidentified sequences (data not shown). To distinguish additional promising clones from the numerous PCR artifacts produced, we performed a BLAST computer search of the expressed sequence tag data base with the sequences of known PPases and those obtained via PCR. One sequence identified in the expressed sequence tag data base was a 875-bp fragment from human fetal brain (GenBankTM accession numberH18854). This clone (ID51064) was obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL), and the sequencing of clone 51064 confirmed the similarity with a DNA fragment produced by PCR. An ∼600-bp probe produced from clone 51064 was then constructed and used to screen a human retina cDNA library. After three rounds of purification, four positive clones were isolated and characterized by sequencing. All of the clones contained the same sequence, and the largest clone contained a 2,658-bp insert. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this clone revealed a 1,959-bp open reading frame flanked by a region containing 234 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence upstream of a translation start site AGTCATGG that is compatible with the Kozark (37Kozark M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consensus sequence. The clone, designated as PP7, also contains a 465-bp 3′-untranslated region ending in a poly(A) tail. The PP7 open reading frame encodes a protein of 653 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 75 kDa. A computer-aided search for homology of the deduced amino acid sequence for PP7 with the GenBankTM/EMBL data bank (GCG; Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) revealed greatest homology with the gene product encoded by the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene (38Steel F.R. Washburn T. Rieger R. O'Tousa J.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 669-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Direct comparison between PP7 and rdgC using “gap routine” (GCG) indicates that they share 42.1% identity and 54.3% similarity when conservative substitutions are considered (Fig.1). In addition, two putative functional domains were identified through a motif search using “motif routine” (GCG). One is a serine/threonine phosphatase catalytic core domain, which is located between amino acids 166 and 436. This core is shared by PP1-PP6 (39Barton G.J. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), and the overall identity of PP7 is 28–35% with these PPases. The similarity increases to 35–44% when conservative substitutions are included. In addition, PP7 contains all 53 of the amino acids that are absolutely conserved in PP1-PP6 (Fig.2) and all of the 16 amino acids predicted to form the active site of these enzymes based on the crystal structure of PP1 (40Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar).Figure 2Homology of PP7 with other serine/threonine PPases. A, a schematic representation of PP7 amino acid (a.a.) similarity with the catalytic subunits of other human serine/threonine PPases. Most PPases contain a common catalytic core domain that is conserved with λ-PPase (53Barik S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 22: 10633-10637Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 59Palczewski K. Farber D.B. Hargrave P.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). PP1, PP2A, PP4, and PP6 are highly homologous enzymes, differing primarily in their C- and N-terminal regions. PP2B differs in that it contains a Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) binding domain in its C-terminal region and two small divergent regions (indicated by open boxes) in the catalytic domain near the okadaic acid/microcystin binding domain. PP5 possesses four tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains in the N-terminal region. PP7 differs from all of the other PPase families in that it contains EF-hand motifs in the C-terminal region (indicated by filled squares) and a 43-amino acid insert in the catalytic core domain (indicated by anopen box). B, sequence similarity between the catalytic core domain of PP7 and other human PPases. Residues that are identical in all of the PPases compared are indicated inboldface type. PP2A is human protein phosphatase type 2A (9Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7215-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), PP1 is human protein phosphatase type 1α (5Song Q. Khanna K.K. Lu H. Lavin M.F. Gene. 1993; 129: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), PP2B is human protein phosphatase type 2B (16Guerini D. Krinks M.H. Sikela J.M. Hahn W.E. Klee C.B. DNA (N.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PP7 is the human retinal protein phosphatase designated as type 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The second domain identified in PP7 is comprised of putative Ca2+ binding EF-hand motifs located in the C-terminal region. Two EF-hand motifs (amino acids 579–591 and 619–631) are excellent matches to the consensus sequence (41Kretsinger R.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and three other EF-hand-like motifs with weaker identity were recognized in the PP7 sequence (Figs. 1 and 2). These EF-hand and EF-hand-like motifs are conserved between PP7 and rdgC (Fig. 2). PP7 also contains an inserted domain made up of 43 amino acids (305–347) in the PPase core region that is not found in PP1-PP6. The rdgC gene sequence predicts that rdgC contains a 15-amino acid insert in a corresponding region, and 6 of the 15 amino acids in the rdgC insert are conserved in PP7. The N-terminal region of PP7 is structurally divergent from that of PP1-PP6 (Fig. 2). The expression of PP7 poly(A)+ RNA in human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, retina, and Y-79 retinoblastoma cells was analyzed by PCR amplification of normalized human cDNA and Northern analysis. PP7 mRNA was only detected in retina and Y-79 cells by PCR analysis, suggesting that PP7 is not ubiquitously expressed like PP1, PP2A, PP4, or PP5. Northern analysis employing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA did not identify PP7 mRNA in any of the tissues tested, identifying a single ∼2.8-kilobase transcript only in mRNA produced from Y-79 cells (Fig. 3 B).

https://openalex.org/W1982640074,"Transport of many organic anions across the bile canalicular membrane is mediated by the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT). Previously, we cloned cDNA that may encode cMOAT from Sprague-Dawley rat liver (Ito, K., Suzuki, H., Hirohashi, T., Kume, K., Shimizu, T., and Sugiyama, Y. (1997)Am. J. Physiol. 272, G16–G22). In the present study, the function of this cloned cDNA was investigated by examining the ATP-dependent uptake ofS-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione (DNP-SG) into membrane vesicles isolated from an NIH/3T3 cell line transfected with an expression vector containing the cloned cDNA. Although the membrane vesicles from the control NIH/3T3 cells exhibited endogenous activity in transporting DNP-SG and leukotriene C4 in an ATP-dependent manner, the transfection of cMOAT cDNA resulted in a significant increase in the transport activity for these ligands. The uptake of DNP-SG into membrane vesicles was osmotically sensitive and was stimulated to some extent by other nucleotide triphosphates (GTP, UTP, and CTP) but not by AMP or ADP. TheK m and V max values for the uptake of DNP-SG by the membrane vesicles were 0.175 ± 0.031 μm and 11.0 ± 0.73 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, for the transfected rat cMOAT and 0.141 ± 0.036 μm and 3.51 ± 0.39 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, for the endogenous transporter expressed on control NIH/3T3 cells. These results suggest that the product of the previously cloned cDNA has cMOAT activity being able to transport organic anions in an ATP-dependent manner. Alternatively, it is possible that the cDNA product encodes an activator of endogenous transporter since the K m value for DNP-SG was comparable between the vector- and cMOAT-transfected cells. The transport activity found in the control NIH/3T3 cells may be ascribed to mouse cMOAT since Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of a transcript that hybridyzed to the carboxyl-terminal ATP-binding cassette sequence of the murine protein."
https://openalex.org/W1965499170,"Strict pharmacological selectivity in families of structurally related ligands and receptors may result from a key process in evolution aiming at increasing diversity in neurotransmission. An intriguing example of such exclusive specificity can be found in the newly discovered orphanin FQ (OFQ) system when it is compared with the opioid system. Both OFQ and its receptor share a high degree of sequence similarity to the opioid peptides and their corresponding receptors, respectively. However, OFQ does not activate opioid receptors, nor do the opioid peptides elicit biological activity at the OFQ receptor. We have therefore investigated the basis for the inherent selectivity of the primary structures of OFQ and dynorphin A, its closest counterpart. A series of truncated and/or chimeric peptides led to the conclusion that both peptides contain domains which establish their pharmacological selectivity. In the OFQ molecule we could delineate a domain that prevents its ability to activate the κ-opioid receptor by apparently repelling its binding. In both peptides the selectivity-generating domains are composed of single residues in key positions together with short stretches of amino acids which do not overlap. To prove this concept, we designed a universal agonist and found it active at both the OFQ receptor and the κ-opioid receptor. Our observations suggest that a coordinated mechanism of evolution has separated the orphanin FQ system from the opioid system.

Orphanin FQ (OFQ), 1The abbreviations used are: OFQ, orphanin FQ; OFQR, orphanin FQ receptor; DOR, δ-opioid receptor; KOR, κ-opioid receptor; MOR, μ-opioid receptor; DynA, dynorphin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. 1The abbreviations used are: OFQ, orphanin FQ; OFQR, orphanin FQ receptor; DOR, δ-opioid receptor; KOR, κ-opioid receptor; MOR, μ-opioid receptor; DynA, dynorphin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. also called nociceptin, is an endogenous ligand for an opioid-like G protein-coupled receptor (1Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O.

This heptadecapeptide shows striking structural homology to the opioid peptides, especially dynorphin A (DynA). However, OFQ does not activate opioid receptors, nor do the opioid peptides elicit any biological effect at the orphanin FQ receptor (OFQR). Despite the high degree of homology between the two ligand/receptor systems, they seem to exert opposite physiological functions. The opioids are known to produce analgesia, whereas OFQ is able to reverse opioid-mediated stress-induced analgesia as well as morphine-induced analgesia (3Mogil J. Grisel J. Reinscheid R.K. Civelli O. Belknap J.K. Grandy D.K. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, OFQ seems to function as an anti-opioid peptide in certain physiological paradigms. These observations prompted us to investigate potential structural determinants in OFQ and DynA which could ensure their pharmacological selectivity. In a structure-activity relationship study we have recently determined the individual amino acid residues as well as some overall structural requirements responsible for the biological activity of OFQ at its receptor (4Reinscheid R.K. Ardati A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14163-14168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This study indicated that OFQ exhibits a structure strikingly different from that of the opioid peptides regarding receptor binding and activation. For example, the amino-terminal Phe can be replaced by Tyr without any loss of binding affinity and biological activity. In addition, although the amino-terminal half of OFQ appeared to be more important for receptor binding than the carboxyl-terminal part, the entire OFQ molecule was required for receptor activation. This is in sharp contrast to the opioid peptides whose binding to their receptors obey the “message-address” concept in which the first part of the peptide is sufficient to activate the receptors, whereas the second part, the address, differentiates the receptor sites (5Nothacker H.-P. Reinscheid R.K. Mansour A. Henningsen R.A. Ardati A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8677-8682Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). OFQ interaction with its receptor on the other hand fits the more general model of effector and cooperative domains, where the effector part confers binding to a complementary site on the receptor but is often not sufficient to exert biological activity on its own. In turn, the cooperative domain alone is not able to induce activation of the receptor but may control specificity. The latter model implies that both effector and cooperative domains are necessary for full agonism (15Lazareno S. Birdsall N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 362-378PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berthold M. Bartfai T. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 22: 1023-1031Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus far only selectivity-enhancing properties of the address domains in opioid peptides have been described, because all naturally occurring opioid peptides are promiscuous ligands at all three opioid receptors, albeit with different selectivity. This observation is surprising, because no conserved structural motif can be found in the address domains of the opioid peptides. Therefore, one cannot explain on a structural level why a peptide like Tyr1-OFQ does not activate the opioid receptors. An intriguing discovery from the structure-activity studies on OFQ is that the OFQR does not discriminate against a Tyr residue in position 1 of the peptide. This raised the question as to why the opioid peptide DynA, which contains the same amino-terminal sequence as Tyr1-OFQ and is of the same length, cannot activate the OFQR and whether structures can be identified within DynA which regulate such activity. Conversely, Tyr1-OFQ was not able to activate opiate receptors although its amino-terminal tetrapeptide contains the Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe motif which is believed to be the minimal structure required for opioid peptide activity. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the structural basis for this exclusive selectivity. Although Tyr1-OFQ is an artificial molecule that has so far not been identified in nature, this is not a purely academic question, because at the genetic level, just a single nucleotide exchange could create a mutation leading to the generation of Tyr1-OFQ (5Nothacker H.-P. Reinscheid R.K. Mansour A. Henningsen R.A. Ardati A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8677-8682Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As outlined before, the OFQR would not select against such a mutant ligand. To attempt answering these questions we designed a number of chimeric OFQ/DynA peptides and investigated their biological activities at both the OFQ and the opioid receptors. Our results indicate that the primary structures of both OFQ and DynA contain domains which ensure proper selectivity of each ligand molecule for only its cognate receptor. Interestingly, derivatives of Tyr1-OFQ truncated at the carboxyl terminus showed considerable activity toward the opioid receptors, whereas the intact Tyr1-OFQ has none. This indicates that the carboxyl-terminal half of OFQ may serve as a domain which excludes it from binding to opioid receptors. From these studies we were able to predict the structure of a universal agonist which activates both the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) and the OFQR. Finally, our studies may provide new insights into the evolutionary events which could have separated the opioid from the OFQ system. OFQ and all chimeric peptides were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Opioid peptides were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland) and non-peptidergic opioid ligands were from RBI (Natick, MA). cAMP assay reagents and [3H]OFQ were obtained from Amersham Corp. [3H]Naloxone was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Forskolin was from Calbiochem, and tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Merck or Sigma. Cloning of the rat OFQR as well as transfection of CHO cells and the characterization of clones expressing the receptor have been described previously (1Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A.

The cDNAs of the rat δ-, κ-, and μ-opioid receptors were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRcRSV (Invitrogen) and transfected into CHO cells. Stably expressing clones (kindly provided by D. Grandy, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) were selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and screened by binding and functional assays. All cells were cultured at 5% CO2in modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 500 μg/ml G418. Adenylyl cyclase assays were carried out as described previously (1Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Science. 1995; 270: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate. Dose-response curves were fitted and calculated with Kaleidagraph. OFQR binding assays were done as described before using [3H]OFQ as a radioligand (7Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Higelin J. Reinscheid R.K. Civelli O. Monsma Jr., F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). κ-Opioid binding was determined on membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing the rat κ-opioid receptor with [3H]naloxone as a radioligand. Incubation of membranes (40 μg of protein) with [3H]naloxone was carried out in the dark at room temperature for 60 min in a total volume of 500 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). For competition binding experiments 1 nm[3H]naloxone was added together with the indicated concentrations of unlabeled peptides. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 μm cold naloxone. Bound and free ligand were separated by rapid vacuum filtration through Unifilter GF/C glass fiber filters using a Unifilter 96 harvester (Canberra Packard). GF/C filters had been pretreated with 0.3% polyethylenimine containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed six times with 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After washing, 60 μl of scintillation fluid (Micro Scint, Canberrra Packard) was added and the plates were counted in a β counter. All experiments were done at least three times in triplicate. Binding data were analyzed by determination of IC50 values using nonlinear curve fitting in Kaleidagraph, and K i values were obtained according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (8Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, OFQ is not able to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO cells stably transfected with the three different opioid receptors. On the other hand, these three receptors responded well to challenge with both peptidergic and non-peptidergic opiates, showing their proper functional expression. The EC50 values for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by the opioid compounds at the respective receptors are summarized in TableI.Table IActivity of orphanin FQ analogs and opioid agonists at the orphanin FQ receptor and the δ-, κ-, and μ-opioid receptorsInhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP, EC50 (±SEM) at theOFQRDORKORMORnmOFQ and DynA-derived peptides OFQFGGFTGARKSARKLANQ1.68 ± 1.03inact.inact.inact.

Tyr1-OFQ contains the amino-terminal tetrapeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe, thus rendering this part of the molecule identical to the opioid motif contained within all mammalian opioid peptides (for sequences of peptides, see Table I). However, as depicted in Fig. 2, Tyr1-OFQ cannot activate the opioid receptors using physiologically relevant concentrations. Only at the KOR was a weak agonistic behavior observed above concentrations of 1 μm. Surprisingly, Tyr1-OFQ inhibited [3H]naloxone binding at the KOR with high affinity (K i = 3.35 ± 2.41 nm; Fig.3 A, TableII). Therefore, we investigated whether Tyr1-OFQ behaved as a very inefficient partial agonist. As shown in Fig. 3, the genuine activity of DynA or U50,488 at the KOR is not inhibited by Tyr1-OFQ. Neither coadministration of 100 nm Tyr1-OFQ with increasing concentrations of DynA or U50,488 (Fig. 3 B) nor application of increasing amounts of Tyr1-OFQ in the presence of 0.1 or 1 nm DynA (Fig. 3 C) affected the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase by these κ-opioid agonists. Also, preincubation with Tyr1-OFQ for different time periods did not alter the response of the KOR to DynA (results not shown). We therefore concluded that Tyr1-OFQ, despite its high binding affinity at the KOR, does not interfere with the mechanism of κ-opioid receptor activation by peptidergic or non-peptidergic agonists. The Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe sequence in Tyr1-OFQ may thus allow for the interaction with the KOR but is not sufficient to endow the peptide molecule with an agonistic activity.Figure 3Interaction of Tyr1-OFQ with the κ-opioid receptor.

Removal of the last eight amino acids of Tyr1-OFQ produced a molecule (Tyr1-OFQ 1–9; Table I) which completely lost activity at the OFQR but gained potency at the KOR. As shown in Fig. 2 B and Table I, Tyr1-OFQ 1–9 inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in KOR-transfected CHO cells with an EC50 of 6.89 ± 1.71 nm. Further truncation of this structure to Tyr1-OFQ 1–7 resulted in a loss of activity at KOR (possibly due to the loss of the charged residues), balanced by the appearance of a weak potency at the DOR (Fig. 2 A). Thus, amino acids 10–15 of Tyr1-OFQ appear to contain a domain which prevents the peptide from activating opioid receptors. To investigate this hypothesis, we created a chimeric peptide (OD Y1–17; Table I) by exchanging amino acids 10–15 of OFQ for the corresponding residues of DynA. This chimeric peptide is an agonist at the δ- and κ-opioid receptors but has lost activity at the OFQR (Fig. 2 and Table I). These results indicate that residues 10–15 of Tyr1-OFQ can act to exclude it from activation of opioid receptors. At the same time, the homologous region of DynA is not sufficient to activate the OFQR. Previous structure-activity relationship studies have identified amino acid residues 1–5 together with Arg8 in the OFQ molecule as the most critical for biological activity (4Reinscheid R.K. Ardati A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14163-14168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that the entire OFQ peptide structure was necessary for activation of the OFQR. Because DynA shows the highest degree of homology to OFQ and is of identical length, we chose this peptide as a model molecule for investigating selectivity domains which could preclude activation of the OFQR. First, we introduced an arginine residue at position 8 of DynA, creating Dyn R6–9 (Table I). This molecule proved to be a very potent κ agonist, inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation with an EC50 of 0.11 ± 0.02 nm in CHO cells expressing the KOR (Fig. 4). It also displaced [3H]naloxone binding at the KOR with aK i of 0.2 ± 0.19 nm. However, Dyn R6–9 did not display biological activity at the OFQR, although a moderate binding affinity with a K i of 25.3 ± 21.7 nm was detected (Table II). The next peptide tested was Dyn R8, in which the sequence of amino acids 8 and 9 of DynA were inverted (Table I). This change resulted in a reduction of potency at the KOR but it also produced a partial agonist at the OFQR (Fig. 4). Dyn R8 could activate both the KOR and the OFQR with EC50values of 10.99 ± 2.93 nm and 61.1 ± 38.3 nm, respectively. The binding potency at the KOR was high, showing a K i of 0.09 ± 0.08 nm, whereas Dyn R8 displaced [3H]OFQ only moderately at the OFQR (K i = 34.9 ± 23.8 nm; TableII). However, it appears that Dyn R8 either has an imperfect cooperative binding domain or contains inhibitory structures preventing full agonism at the OFQR. The existence of domains which generate selectivity in peptides of related structure can be tested by designing an agonist which would act at both related receptors. Owing to the fact that the OFQR appears to require a 17-amino-acid peptide for biological activity, we aimed at a heptadecapeptide structure combining all the information about selectivity domains in OFQ as well as DynA. Our studies on Tyr1-OFQ 1–9 and OD Y1–17 had shown that amino acids 1–9 of Tyr1-OFQ are permissive with regard to opioid receptor activity. We therefore used this part of the molecule as an amino-terminal building block. This was combined with a modified carboxyl-terminal half of DynA containing two substitutions: 1) the proline residue in position 10 of DynA was replaced with alanine, as proline is known to induce profound changes in the secondary structure of peptide chains; 2) the negative charge of the aspartate at position 15 in DynA was eliminated by replacement with alanine. The resulting chimeric peptide (OD R8; Table I) proved to be a full agonist at both the OFQR and the KOR with EC50 values of 86.7 ± 26.4 nm and 659 ± 191 nm, respectively (Fig.4). OD R8 displaced [3H]naloxone at the KOR with aK i of 4.37 ± 4.89 nm. A lower affinity value was observed at the OFQR, where OD R8 displaced [3H]OFQ with a K i of 45.7 ± 32.5 nm (Table II). Although OD R8 is not a highly potent molecule, by being a full agonist at both receptors it verifies our concept of selectivity-generating domains within the two parent peptides. These domains in both OFQ and DynA might be responsible for the observed lack of receptor cross-activation. In the present study we have sought to investigate the structural basis of pharmacological selectivity in two closely related neuropeptides, the recently discovered orphanin FQ and dynorphin A. Our results indicate the presence of specific domains in both peptides that prevent cross-activation of inappropriate receptors. To support this concept, we designed a universal agonist in which the restrictive structures have been eliminated and showed that this peptide is active at both the OFQR and the KOR. Within the primary structure of OFQ the amino-terminal Phe is the first determinant which excludes it from being an opioid agonist, as all the opioid receptors stringently require a Tyr in that position (9Paterson S.J. Kosterlitz H.W. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Neuropeptides. 1984; 5: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Hruby V.J. Gehrig C.A. Med. Res. Rev. 1989; 9: 343-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, the present study shows that OFQ also contains a domain located between amino acids 10 and 15, which excludes it from activating the κ-opioid receptor. We could also identify selectivity generating structures in DynA residing between amino acids 7 and 10 together with Asp15. Although the message domain of DynA is recognized by the OFQR, the lack of a cooperative binding site in the carboxyl-terminal half of the peptide prevents activation of the OFQR. Thus, the address or cooperative domain of DynA appears not only to enhance the peptide's affinity for the KOR but simultaneously restricts its biological activity, excluding it from the OFQR. Such a dual role of the address domain in DynA could not be recognized before the discovery of OFQ. We would therefore like to propose an addition to the traditional message-address (6Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) to include the existence of domains that generate selectivity between sequentially related peptides as depicted in Fig. 5. Although our studies have focused mainly on DynA and the κ-opioid receptor as the closest relatives to OFQ and its receptor, it is likely that similar results would be obtained with the other opioid peptides and their receptors. For example, the size of the enkephalins or β-endorphin together with the absence of an arginine residue in position 8 should be sufficient to exclude them from activating the OFQR. Conversely, the fact that Tyr1-OFQ is unable to activate the DOR or MOR suggests that a similar mechanism of structural restriction excludes Tyr1-OFQ from these receptors, as shown for KOR. However, the individual amino acids responsible for the selectivity between OFQR and DOR or MOR might be different from the ones identified as preventing KOR activation, because Tyr1-OFQ 1–9 is unable to activate DOR or MOR. Further mutation experiments will be necessary to delineate these domains in other opioid peptides and those in Tyr1-OFQ which exclude it to interact with DOR and MOR. The domains that generate OFQ versus DynA selectivity are non-continuous and show virtually no overlap, indicating that a multistep mechanism of evolution, rather than a single point mutation, led to this separation. This hypothesis is supported by results from a recent study using site-directed mutagenesis showing that the OFQ receptor also contains structures which specifically exclude opioid peptides from binding (11Meng F. Taylor L.P. Hoversten M.T. Ueda Y. Ardati A. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma Jr., F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32016-32020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As few as four amino acid exchanges at remote sites of the protein are sufficient to endow the OFQR with high affinity opioid peptide binding while not affecting its affinity for OFQ itself. Thus, the wild type OFQR harbors opioid peptide-excluding structures which are clearly distinct from the binding sites for its endogenous ligand. The positions of the mutations are distributed over a larger area of the OFQR, indicating that, as proposed for the peptide ligands, a number of separate mutation events must have occurred on the receptor side. It appears that coordinate evolution in both the ligands and the receptors may have led to the complete pharmacological separation of the OFQ system from the opioid system and vice versa. This idea is also consistent with the finding that OFQ can act as an antiopioid peptide (3Mogil J. Grisel J. Reinscheid R.K. Civelli O. Belknap J.K. Grandy D.K. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), as such an activity necessitates a mechanism to prevent any cross-activation of the two systems. A similar theory has been proposed for the glycoprotein hormones lutropin and follitropin and their respective receptors. Based upon their similarity in sequence it is assumed that both the ligands and receptors might have originated from common ancestors, as in the case of the OFQ and opioid systems. However, lutropin and follitropin are clearly characterized by their distinct pharmacology, reflected by the exclusive interaction with only one specific type of receptor. In an elegant study by Moyle et al. (12Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang X. Nature. 1994; 368: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) it was demonstrated that distinct domains in both the glycoprotein hormones as well as their receptors restrict ligand-binding specificity. As noted for the OFQ and the opioid systems, the selectivity determinants in lutropin and follitropin and their receptors are composed of short stretches of amino acids which are non-overlapping. In the case of the glycoprotein hormone receptors this phenomenon could be explained by exon shuffling, because the individual selectivity domains of the lutropin and the follitropin receptor could each be matched to separate exons. However, a different genetic mechanism must be postulated for both the OFQR and the KOR, as the critical parts of the proteins are both contained within the third exon of the respective coding regions (13Nishi M. Takeshima H. Mori M. Nakagawara K. Takeuchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1353-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Finally, one may ask why such a stringent selectivity evolved. Restrictive control of ligand/receptor selectivity is a prerequisite in cases of anatomical separation between sites of release and sites of action. Such a situation obviously exists in the case of the glycoprotein hormones, where the humoral mode of ligand distribution provides an ubiquitous appearance of the ligand but simultaneously imposes a need for the development of selectivity. OFQ and the opioids, on the other hand, are believed to exert their activity at specific synaptic junctions as do other neuropeptides. Our observations of mutual exclusion in the two systems might therefore be interpreted in several ways. First, one may still consider that important functions of OFQ and the opioids might be found in the periphery which rely on humoral transport of the transmitters. Another possibility could be a colocalization of the receptors and/or the peptides at certain synapses, although recent anatomical studies seem to disprove this idea (14Schulz S. Schreff M. Nuss D. Gramsch C. Höllt V. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 3021-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). But the broad distribution of the OFQR in the central nervous system indeed suggests that it might be found in close spatial proximity to opioid receptors. What this strict selectivity indicates is a need for OFQ and the opioid peptides to be clearly differentiated, which in turn suggests that OFQ may have additional functions unrelated to those it has in the modulation of nociception. In summary, we have determined the structural basis for pharmacological selectivity between the OFQ and the κ-opioid system which prevents cross-activation of their respective receptors. A coordinated evolution of the ligands and the receptors must have occurred to ensure proper separation of the physiological functions of the two systems. The incorporation of structures that prevent activation of related but inappropriate binding sites, rather than inventing two sets of totally new sites, might represent a general evolutionary strategy by which nature can gain variability in signal transduction. Knowledge of these specific motifs will also be helpful in the development of selective drugs to a single class of receptors. We thank D. K. Grandy and J. R.

Although the two expression systems yielded comparable results, recent studies demonstrated that there is no distinct correlation between junctional conductance, dye transfer, and/or ion selectivity of gap junctions in either system (26Elfgang C.

In a mammalian expression system, differences in the extent of dye transfer have been detected between several types of connexin transfectants, although they showed similar junctional conductance (26Elfgang C.

Therefore, analysis of serial changes in [Ca2+] i by a Ca2+ imaging system should be required to study the functional role of gap junction on an intercellular Ca2+ signaling. We designed a cell system in which cells expressing both connexin-43 and ryanodine receptor are surrounded by cells expressing only connexin-43 on the basis of preliminary results: 1) HEK293 cells do not express caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor nor functional gap junction, and 2) transfected HEK293 cells express ryanodine receptor and connexin-43 functioning in a proper manner. By using a Ca2+ imaging system, we could observe an intercellular Ca2+ wave from a cell triggering Ca2+excitation through a confluent monolayer of cells. A hydrophobicity plot of connexin-43 showed it consists of four hydrophobic membrane spanning domains separated by hydrophilic segments (9Bennett M.V.L. Barrio L.C. Bargiello T.A. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E. Saez J.C. Neuron. 1991; 6: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 28Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The two hydrophilic extracellular loops (encompassing amino acids 44–68 and 185–207 of connexin-43) are highly conserved in all connexin isoforms. The most striking feature of these two extracellular loops is the presence of six cysteine residues. Each loop has three cysteine residues with the consensus for the first loop being CX 6CX 3C (Cys54, Cys61, and Cys68 in connexin-43) and for the second loop CX 4CX 5C (Cys187, Cys192 and Cys198 in connexin-43). In the structure of the intercellular channel, it is the extracellular domain where the homophilic docking of hemichannels must occur that eventually results in the opening of the cell-cell channel. In general, two cysteine residues at different points on the polypeptide chain but adjacent in the three-dimensional structure of a protein can be oxidized to form a disulfide bond, which stabilizes the correct folding of the protein. In this study, we determined whether the formation of disulfide bonds in the extracellular domain directs the correct assembly of the gap junction. The sequence corresponding to rat connexin-43 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using mRNA isolated from rat heart and cloned into the Bluescript KS(+) vector. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed according to the published sequence (28Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) with an EcoRI site at the 5′-end to facilitate cloning. The cloned sequences were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel (29Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Mutations were carried out in specific cDNA fragments, which were ligated into sites in the polylinker in the Bluescript KS(+) vector. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing mutated bases were hybridized to a fragment of cDNA inserted into the single-stranded template to begin mutagenesis. After verifying the nucleotide sequences, the mutated fragment was ligated back into its original position in the cDNA. For mutation of the cysteine residues at positions 54, 61, and 68 to serine residues, theHindIII-HincII fragment of connexin-43 cDNA in the Bluescript KS(+) vector was used as a template to replace these cysteines with serines. For mutation of the cysteine residues at positions 187, 192, and 198 to serine residues, theHincII-SacI fragment in the Bluescript KS(+) vector was used. For mutation of cysteine residues at positions 260, 271, and 298 to serine residues, the SacI-EcoRI fragment was used. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin at 37 °C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Connexin-43 cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), containing the neomycin (G418)-resistant gene as a dominant selectable marker. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique and then the transfected cells were grown for selection in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418. Each of the clones selected with G418 was further analyzed by Northern blot and immunoblot analyses. The selected clones expressing connexin-43 or HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips in the usual medium without G418. When the cells had grown to a confluence level of approximately 30%, they were transfected with the ryanodine receptor cDNA in the PMT2 expression vector and then grown for 24–48 h before experimentation. Total cellular RNA from HEK293 cells and transfected cells was extracted, electrophoretically separated in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and then capillary-blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were hybridized with32P-labeled connexin-43 cDNA or ryanodine receptor cDNA probes and then examined by autoradiography. Cells of each type were harvested and pelleted with a microcentrifuge. Plasma membrane-enriched protein fractions of HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone or pcDNA3 containing connexin-43 cDNA were prepared by lysing the pellets in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by repelleting by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 min. Microsomal membrane protein fractions of HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone or PMT2 containing ryanodine receptor cDNA were prepared by the method previously described (30Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Then samples were solubilized in the SDS loading buffer and resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blots were incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-connexin-43 IgG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), a monoclonal mouse anti-ryanodine receptor IgM antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or a monoclonal mouse anti-InsP3 receptor IgG antibody (American Research Products Inc.). The blots were then washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with a peroxidase-labeled affinity purified anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody or a peroxidase-labeled whole anti-mouse Ig antibody, washed again, and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. Cells on a glass cover slide were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, cells were incubated with either a monoclonal mouse anti-connexin-43 IgG antibody or a monoclonal mouse anti-ryanodine receptor IgM antibody for 2 h. Anti-connexin-43 antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h. Anti-ryanodine receptor antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgM (Organon Teknika Corp.) for 1 h. Cover slides were then mounted in Mowiol 4–88 (Vector Laboratories Inc.). The cells were photographed on a Olympus Provis AX80 microscope fitted with the appropriate filters. [Ca2+] i was determined by measurement of fura-2/AM fluorescence (Molecular Probe Inc.). Cells on a glass cover slide were loaded with fura-2/AM by incubation in the usual medium containing 5 μm fura-2/AM and 0.06% pluronic F127 (Molecular Probe Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. After loading, the cells were washed with the medium twice and then used for the experiment immediately. A glass cover slide of dye-loaded cells was mounted in a laminar flow perfusion chamber and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. The cells were continuously superfused with HEPES buffer comprising 15 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm CaCl2. Fluorescence images were obtained by alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm using twin xenon arc lamps with an image processor (Argus-50/Ca, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). [Ca2+] i was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 340 and 380 nm at 2-s intervals. Application of caffeine, an activator of the ryanodine receptor (31Meissner G. Lai F.A.

Valdivia H.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was performed by replacing the control HEPES buffer with the same buffer containing 15 mm caffeine, during which maps of [Ca2+] i in all cells in frame were obtained using the image processor. Inhibitors of gap junctional communication, octanol and doxyl stearic acids (DSA) (33Burt J.M. Spray D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H1206-H1210PubMed Google Scholar, 34Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C913-C924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were examined as to their effects on cell-cell coupling of connexin-43-expressing cells. Cells were first superfused with HEPES buffer containing 15 mm caffeine to establish the presence of cell-cell coupling by demonstrating an intercellular Ca2+ wave. Following recovery, the cells were superfused with HEPES buffer containing 500 μm octanol or 50 μm DSA to block the cell-cell coupling. After 5 min, the cells were superfused with the HEPES buffer containing 15 mm caffeine a second time. After washing out of the octanol or DSA with the HEPES buffer, the cells were superfused with the HEPES buffer containing 15 mm caffeine a third time to demonstrate the reversibility of the actions of the drugs. The role of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release mechanism on the intercellular Ca2+ wave was examined by using activators and inhibitors of InsP3 production. Histamine and vasopressin activate phospholipase C, leading to a dramatic increase in intracellular InsP3 production (35Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 450: 163-178Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Application of histamine or vasopressin was performed by replacing the control HEPES buffer with same buffer containing 10 μmhistamine or 0.5 nm vasopressin. U73122 inhibits phospholipase C, leading to a block of intracellular InsP3production (36Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. Smith R.J. Sam L.M.

Cells were first superfused with HEPES buffer containing 15 mm caffeine to establish the presence of cell-cell coupling by demonstrating an intercellular Ca2+wave. Following recovery, the cells were superfused with HEPES buffer containing 10 μm U73122 to block the InsP3production. After 5 min, the cells were superfused with the HEPES buffer containing 15 mm caffeine a second time. Gap junctional conductance was measured with the double whole cell patch-clamp procedure (16Spray D.C. Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Neyton J. Trautmann A. Nature. 1985; 317: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) using Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Cell pairs were obtained by freshly dissociating pure populations of confluent cultures on 1-cm diameter glass coverslips. The coverslip was transferred to the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope, where experiments were performed at room temperature while exchanging the bath solution (133 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 1.0 mmCaCl2, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 16 mm glucose, 3.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Each cell of a pair was voltage-clamped using patch-type pipette made on Narishige NA-9 vertical puller and filled with a solution at pCa 8 (135 mm CsCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm EGTA, 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). High resistance seals (>109ohms) were formed on each cell with the aid of gentle suction, and access to the cell interior was then gained by brief strong suction applied to the patch-type pipette. Cells were voltage-clamped at holding potentials of −40 mV and applied 10 mV voltage pulses to each cell of the pair. Junctional current (Ij) was measured as the current evoked in one cell by the voltage step in the other cell (Vj). Junctional conductance (Gj) was calculated by the equation Ij/Vj. Highly enriched connexins were obtained by an alkaline extraction procedure (39Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were harvested and pelleted. The pellets were resuspended in 2m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm glycine NaOH, pH 10, with the aid of a 23-gauge syringe needle, and then sonicated for about 20 s in a bath sonicator. The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was concentrated with a Centriprep 30 microconcentrator (Amicon). The concentrated protein was applied to a column packed with Superose 6 prep grade (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) and eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. Fractions collected from the column were analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-connexin-43 antibody. Then the fractions containing connexin-43 were pooled. By repeated concentration and redilution in a Centriprep 30 microconcentrator, the pooled protein was equilibrated against 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of 0.1 mmtri-n-butylphosphine (TBP), a powerful reagent for the specific cleavage of disulfide bonds in proteins (40Ruegg U.T. Rudinger J. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The sample was incubated for 20 min at 60 °C, cooled to 23 °C, and then transferred to a tube containing 20 μCi of [14C]iodoacetamide (8 mm final concentration), as described (41Dohlman H.G. Caron M.G. DeBlasi A. Frielle T. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-connexin-43 antibody mixed with an affinity purified anti-mouse IgG(Fc) antibody and 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose in a buffer comprising 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The immunoprecipitated samples were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, solubilized in SDS loading buffer, and then resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and examined by autoradiography. Compared with the trivial amounts of connexin-43 mRNA and protein in HEK293 cells, the transfection of HEK293 cells with connexin-43 cDNA resulted in clones with high levels of its mRNA and protein (Fig. 1,A and B). Furthermore, clones expressing connexin-43 showed a significantly decreased rate of cellular proliferation, as previously demonstrated in an experiment on C6 glioma cells (23Zhu D. Caveney S. Kidder G.M. Naus C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical localization of the connexin-43 protein in clones expressing connexin-43 revealed a pattern of dense immunoreactivity at cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 1 C), in contrast to those in HEK293 cells which showed no detectable immunoreactive sites between cells (data not shown). When clones expressing connexin-43 were transfected with ryanodine receptor cDNA, the levels of its mRNA and protein were much greater than those in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A andB). The immunocytochemical localization of ryanodine receptor protein in transfected cells revealed that approximately 1–5% of the total cells expressed this protein in the cytoplasmic structures (Fig. 2 C), which appeared to be identical to the previous result (30Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Caffeine has been shown to be an activator of the ryanodine receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (31Meissner G. Lai F.A. Anderson K. Xu L. Liu Q.Y. Herrmann Frank A. Rousseau E. Jones R.V. Lee H.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 304: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Coronado R. Kawano S. Lee C.J. Valdivia C. Valdivia H.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When caffeine was applied to ryanodine receptor cDNA-transfected cells, caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ release was observed in one cell at the periphery of cell clusters, which appeared to be ryanodine receptor-expressing cells (Fig.2 A). This indicated that the expressed ryanodine receptor had formed a functional Ca2+ release channel in an intracellular membrane in transfected cells. When connexin-43-expressing cells were transfected with pMT2 vector containing ryanodine receptor cDNA, application of caffeine increased [Ca2+] i in two separate cells in cell cluster, and then the increased [Ca2+] i was propagated cell by cell in all directions to surrounding cells in culture. The magnitude of the increase in [Ca2+] i reached 500 nm and lasted for 30 s as long as the application of caffeine was continued (Fig. 2 B-1). Thus, Ca2+ released from an intracellular store through the activated ryanodine receptor triggered large scale Ca2+propagation to surrounding cells. To determine whether the propagation of Ca2+ between cells occurred through gap junctions composed of connexin-43, we next added an inhibitor of gap junctional communication to the superfusion. We used octanol and DSA, which are known to block gap junctional communication rapidly and reversibly in many cell types, including cardiac myocytes (33Burt J.M. Spray D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H1206-H1210PubMed Google Scholar, 34Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C913-C924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and chick lens epithelial cells (42Miller T.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Five minutes after the start of octanol administration, caffeine was applied to the same cells. In contrast to the extensive Ca2+propagation response without the inhibitor, caffeine application increased [Ca2+] i in two cells, which were the same caffeine-"
https://openalex.org/W2049363790,"α-Latrotoxin is a potent neurotoxin from black widow spider venom that binds to presynaptic receptors and causes massive neurotransmitter release. A surprising finding was the biochemical description of two distinct cell surface proteins that bind α-latrotoxin with nanomolar affinities; Neurexin Iα binds α-latrotoxin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and CIRL/latrophilin binds in a Ca2+-independent manner. We have now generated and analyzed mice that lack neurexin Iα to test its importance in α-latrotoxin action. α-Latrotoxin binding to brain membranes from mutant mice was decreased by almost 50% compared with wild type membranes; the decrease was almost entirely due to a loss of Ca2+-dependent α-latrotoxin binding sites. In cultured hippocampal neurons, α-latrotoxin was still capable of activating neurotransmission in the absence of neurexin Iα. Direct measurements of [3H]glutamate release from synaptosomes, however, showed a major decrease in the amount of release triggered by α-latrotoxin in the presence of Ca2+. Thus neurexin Iα is not essential for α-latrotoxin action but contributes to α-latrotoxin action when Ca2+ is present. Viewed as a whole, our results show that mice contain two distinct types of α-latrotoxin receptors with similar affinities and abundance but different properties and functions. The action of α-latrotoxin may therefore be mediated by independent parallel pathways, of which the CIRL/latrophilin pathway is sufficient for neurotransmitter release, whereas the neurexin Iα pathway contributes to the Ca2+-dependent action of α-latrotoxin. α-Latrotoxin is a potent neurotoxin from black widow spider venom that binds to presynaptic receptors and causes massive neurotransmitter release.

Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). α-Latrotoxin is thought to elicit neurotransmitter release by binding to presynaptic receptors. Only nanomolar concentrations of α-latrotoxin are required to trigger exocytosis, suggesting the presence of high affinity receptors. Binding activates an unknown signal transduction cascade that leads to exocytosis of virtually all synaptic vesicles. α-Latrotoxin also induces neurotransmitter release in the absence of Ca2+ in a manner that circumvents the normal Ca2+-dependent stimulation pathway for synaptic vesicle exocytosis (2Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of α-latrotoxin and the nature of the intracellular signaling cascades involved are unknown.Two membrane proteins that bind α-latrotoxin with high affinity have been isolated from brain. The first such protein identified was neurexin Iα, which was isolated by affinity chromatography of brain proteins on immobilized α-latrotoxin (3Petrenko A.G. Lazaryeva V.D. Geppert M. Tarasyuk T.A.

Neurexins are highly polymorphic and neuron-specific in expression (7Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).

Experiments with recombinant neurexin Iα confirmed that it binds to α-latrotoxin with high affinity but showed that this interaction is completely dependent on Ca2+ (11Davletov B. Krasnoperov V.

Despite the wealth of biochemical data on neurexins and their interactions with endogenous ligands and α-latrotoxin, the in vivo roles of neurexins are unknown.The observations that α-latrotoxin binds to neurexin Iα only in the presence of Ca2+ but triggers neurotransmitter release also in the absence of Ca2+ suggested that there must be a second α-latrotoxin receptor in addition to neurexin Iα. Based on this finding, a second high affinity receptor for α-latrotoxin called CIRL or latrophilin was identified (12Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G.

Surprisingly, CIRL has no structural similarity to neurexins. The presence of two distinct high affinity binding proteins for α-latrotoxin in brain raises the possibility that α-latrotoxin may physiologically act via two independent receptor pathways or that the in vitro binding of α-latrotoxin by one of the two putative receptors may represent an artifact. In the current study, we have addressed this question using knockout mice. We have generated a mouse line in which expression of neurexin Iα was abolished and investigated the importance of neurexin Iα for brain function and α-latrotoxin action. Our data confirm that neurexin Iα constitutes a major α-latrotoxin receptor. We show that neurexin Iα is not required for α-latrotoxin action in the absence of Ca2+ but is essential for full α-latrotoxin action in the presence of Ca2+.DISCUSSIONNeurexins are a family of highly polymorphic cell surface proteins with a receptor like structure. There are three α- and three β-neurexins, each of which is alternatively spliced. Neurexins interact with at least two endogenous ligands: α-neurexins bind to neurexophilin (10Petrenko A.G.

The structures and known ligands of neurexins indicate the possibility of dual functions for neurexins as cell adhesion molecules and signal transduction receptors (24Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

However, the exact in vivo roles of neurexins are unclear.As a first step to probe the functions of neurexins and their role in α-latrotoxin action, we have now produced mice that lack neurexin Iα. Our data show that these mice are remarkably normal, suggesting that neurexin Iα is not an essential gene and not required for basic nervous system functions. This finding suggests that neurexin Iα is functionally redundant or that it performs a more subtle function that is not immediately apparent in the analysis performed here. The presence of multiple neurexins with overlapping expression patterns (7Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) would agree well with functional redundancy. This indicates that neurexins may substitute for each other functionally. On the other hand we found that the maternal behavior of the neurexin Iα knockout mice appears to be abnormal, suggesting that subtle defects may exist in the single neurexin Iα knockout. Future experiments using knockouts of multiple neurexins and a detailed behavioral analysis will be required to resolve these questions.α-Latrotoxin is an excitatory neurotoxin that is a component of black widow spider venom and produces massive neurotransmitter release after binding to presynaptic nerve terminals (reviewed in Ref. 1Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although α-latrotoxin binding to neurexin Iα requires Ca2+ (11Davletov B. Krasnoperov V. Hata Y. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23903-23905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), α-latrotoxin induces neurotransmitter release even in the absence of Ca2+, indicating that a second receptor for α-latrotoxin may mediate its toxicity in the nerve terminal. Such a receptor was recently identified in CIRL/latrophilin, a membrane protein that resembles G-protein-linked receptors and binds α-latrotoxin with high affinity in the absence of Ca2+ (12Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).It is puzzling that neurons should express two distinct α-latrotoxin receptors with different binding properties (Ca2+-dependent versusCa2+-independent) but similar affinities. Although the two types of α-latrotoxin receptors have been characterized thoroughly biochemically, it is unknown if they function as α-latrotoxin receptors in vivo. To address this question, we analyzed α-latrotoxin action in the neurexin Iα-deficient mice that we had generated. Our data demonstrate that in the neurexin Iα-deficient mice, most of the Ca2+-dependent α-latrotoxin binding activity is lost, whereas Ca2+-independent binding is unchanged. The α-latrotoxin affinities of neurexin Iα and CIRL are very similar, as is the relative abundance of the Ca2+-dependent binding site due to neurexin Iα and the Ca2+-independent binding site presumably due to CIRL. Thus neurexin Iα accounts for the bulk of the Ca2+-dependent high affinity binding of α-latrotoxin. We found, however, that α-latrotoxin is still capable of triggering neurotransmitter release in cultured hippocampal neurons or synaptosomes from neurexin Iα-deficient mice. Therefore neurexin Iα is not absolutely required for the excitotoxic action of α-latrotoxin. Nevertheless, we observed that in the presence of Ca2+, glutamate release triggered by α-latrotoxin from synaptosomes is decreased in the knockout mice compared with wild type mice. If release is stimulated by α-latrotoxin or by sucrose in the absence of Ca2+, no change is observed, indicating that the general release apparatus is intact. This finding also agree well with the electrophysiological data and the mild phenotype of the knockout mice. Viewed together, our data demonstrate that neurexin Iα is not essential for the ability of α-latrotoxin to trigger neurotransmitter release but contributes to α-latrotoxin action in the presence of Ca2+.What could the action of neurexin Iα be compared with that of CIRL? CIRL is the presumptive Ca2+-independent α-latrotoxin receptor that probably mediates the α-latrotoxin-dependent activation of neurotransmitter release observed in the neurexin Iα knockout mice. Our finding that in the presence of Ca2+, neurexin Iα is required for a full response to α-latrotoxin at low concentrations suggests two possibilities. Either neurexin Iα and CIRL represent independent pathways for α-latrotoxin action that work in parallel, or neurexin Iα assists CIRL in the presence of Ca2+ in triggering neurotransmitter release. In either case, neurexin Iα represents a target for α-latrotoxin. Futhermore, it is possible that α-latrotoxin may have as yet unidentified effects other than triggering neurotransmitter release, which could be mediated by neurexin Iα. Taken together, with the identification of two structurally different, presumably cooperative receptors the action of α-latrotoxin is much more complex than previously envisioned. α-Latrotoxin is a potent neurotoxin from black widow spider venom that triggers neurotransmitter release (reviewed in Ref. 1Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). α-Latrotoxin is thought to elicit neurotransmitter release by binding to presynaptic receptors. Only nanomolar concentrations of α-latrotoxin are required to trigger exocytosis, suggesting the presence of high affinity receptors. Binding activates an unknown signal transduction cascade that leads to exocytosis of virtually all synaptic vesicles. α-Latrotoxin also induces neurotransmitter release in the absence of Ca2+ in a manner that circumvents the normal Ca2+-dependent stimulation pathway for synaptic vesicle exocytosis (2Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of α-latrotoxin and the nature of the intracellular signaling cascades involved are unknown. Two membrane proteins that bind α-latrotoxin with high affinity have been isolated from brain. The first such protein identified was neurexin Iα, which was isolated by affinity chromatography of brain proteins on immobilized α-latrotoxin (3Petrenko A.G. Lazaryeva V.D. Geppert M. Tarasyuk T.A. Moomaw C. Khokhlatchev A.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. Slaughter C. Nasimov I.V. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1860-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the neurexin genes contains two promoters that direct synthesis of α- and β-neurexins. Neurexins are highly polymorphic and neuron-specific in expression (7Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Their structure and interactions with putative endogenous ligands (neuroligins and neurexophilin) suggest a receptor function (8Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C.

Experiments with recombinant neurexin Iα confirmed that it binds to α-latrotoxin with high affinity but showed that this interaction is completely dependent on Ca2+ (11Davletov B. Krasnoperov V.

Despite the wealth of biochemical data on neurexins and their interactions with endogenous ligands and α-latrotoxin, the in vivo roles of neurexins are unknown. The observations that α-latrotoxin binds to neurexin Iα only in the presence of Ca2+ but triggers neurotransmitter release also in the absence of Ca2+ suggested that there must be a second α-latrotoxin receptor in addition to neurexin Iα. Based on this finding, a second high affinity receptor for α-latrotoxin called CIRL or latrophilin was identified (12Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G.

Either neurexin Iα and CIRL represent independent pathways for α-latrotoxin action that work in parallel, or neurexin Iα assists CIRL in the presence of Ca2+ in triggering neurotransmitter release. In either case, neurexin Iα represents a target for α-latrotoxin. Futhermore, it is possible that α-latrotoxin may have as yet unidentified effects other than triggering neurotransmitter release, which could be mediated by neurexin Iα. Taken together, with the identification of two structurally different, presumably cooperative receptors the action of α-latrotoxin is much more complex than previously envisioned. We thank Dr. Y. A. Ushkaryov for the initial isolation of genomic neurexin Iα clones; Dr. Y. Hata for the generation of antibodies to His-tagged neurexin tails expressed in bacteria; and M. S. Brown, and J. L. Goldstein for invaluable discussions."

Synapsins contain a single evolutionarily conserved, large central domain, the C-domain, that accounts for the majority of their sequences. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of the C-domain from synapsin I revealed that it is structurally closely related to several ATPases despite the absence of sequence similarities (Esser, L., Wang, C.-R., Hosaka, M., Smagula, C. S., Südhof, T. C., and Deisenhofer, J. (1998)EMBO J., in press). We now show that the C-domains of both synapsin I and synapsin II constitute high affinity ATP-binding modules. The two C-domains exhibit similar ATP affinities but are differentially regulated; ATP binding to synapsin I is Ca2+-dependent whereas ATP binding to synapsin II is Ca2+-independent. In synapsin I, the Ca2+requirement for ATP binding is mediated by a single, evolutionarily conserved glutamate residue (Glu373) at a position where synapsin II contains a lysine residue. Exchange of Glu373for lysine converts synapsin I from a Ca2+-dependent protein into a Ca2+-independent ATP-binding protein.

Our studies suggest that synapsins I and II function on synaptic vesicles as ATP-binding proteins that are differentially regulated by Ca2+. Ever since their discovery as major brain phosphoproteins and abundant components of synaptic vesicles, synapsins have been intensely studied (1Johnson E.M. Ueda T. Maeno H. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5650-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, synapsins constitute a family of at least four homologous proteins (synapsins Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb; collectively referred to as synapsins I and II) that are derived by alternative splicing from the primary transcripts of two genes (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. DeCamilli P. Greengard P.

The four synapsins are composed of common amino-terminal domains found in all synapsins (the short A- and B-domains and the long C-domain) and divergent carboxyl-terminal domains that are present in different combinations in each synapsin (D- to I-domains) (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. DeCamilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The C-domains account for more than half of the synapsin sequences and constitute their most conserved domain. In addition to the vertebrate synapsins, a synapsin gene was described in Drosophila; this gene also produces two protein products that differ at the carboxyl terminus (5Klagges B.R. Heimbeck G. Godenschwege T. Hofbauer A. Pflugfelder G.O. Reifegerste R. Reisch D. Schaupp M. Buchner S. Buchner E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3154-3165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only the C-domain is highly conserved between vertebrate and invertebrate synapsins, suggesting that it is the central functional domain.The four vertebrate synapsins are co-expressed in most neurons (6Ullrich B. Südhof T.C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They are substrates for multiple protein kinases. All synapsins contain a phosphorylation site for Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, and protein kinase A at the amino terminus (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A.

In addition, synapsin I but not synapsin II is phosphorylated by Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Cdk5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase at more carboxyl-terminal sites (7Czernik A.J.

The physiological roles of the synapsins have remained elusive because their sequences are not related to proteins of known functions and because they are sticky proteins that bind to a number of possible targets (actin filaments, microtubules, neurofilaments, spectrin, calmodulin, annexin, to name a few of the binding proteins described; reviewed in Refs. 10Greengard P.

In knockout mice, synapsins are essential for maintaining stable vesicles and for normal short term synaptic plasticity, suggesting that they constitute important regulatory molecules (13Rosahl T.W.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These experiments established that synapsins function in mature synapses but did not reveal their actual activity in the nerve terminal.Recently, the crystal structure of the C-domain of bovine synapsin I was solved (16Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The structure revealed that the C-domain constitutes a large, independently folding domain that forms a stable dimer. Surprisingly, data bank searches for three-dimensionally related proteins demonstrated that the C-domain of synapsin I is very similar to the structures of five ATP-utilizing enzymes: glutathione synthetase, d-alanine:d-alanine ligase, biotin carboxylase α-chain, succinyl-CoA synthetase β-chain, and pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase. No sequence similarity was detected between these proteins and the C-domain of synapsin I, but more than 80% of the Cα carbon atoms of the C-domain can be superimposed on those of glutathione synthetase ord-alanine:d-alanine ligase with a root mean square deviation of 0.32 nm. The five enzymes to which synapsin I is structurally related bind ATP and transfer phosphate from bound ATP to a substrate (17Matsuda K. Mizuguchi K. Nishioka T. Kato H. Go N. Oda J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that synapsin I may also bind ATP and be a phosphotransfer enzyme. In support of this, the structure of a complex of the synapsin I C-domain with ATPγS 1The abbreviations used are: ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GST, glutathioneS-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GST, glutathioneS-transferase. and Ca2+was solved (16Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this structure, ATP was bound by residues similar to the ATP-binding residues in the structurally related enzymes, and Ca2+ was coordinated by the pyrophosphate moiety of ATPγS and two glutamate residues (Glu373 and Glu386).The crystal structure of the synapsin I C-domain suggested the possibility that ATP binding may be regulated by Ca2+, an interesting hypothesis in view of the role of synapsins in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis (13Rosahl T.W.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the C-domains of synapsins I and II are highly homologous, the results with the synapsin I C-domain raised the question if synapsin II also binds ATP. We have now addressed these issues using recombinant C-domains from synapsins I and II. Our results show that all synapsins bind ATP; surprisingly, ATP binding is directly regulated by Ca2+ only in synapsin I but not synapsin II. The distinct regulatory properties of synapsins depend on a single, evolutionarily conserved amino acid, indicating an evolutionary selection of their separate regulatory properties. These data suggest that synapsins may be differentially regulated phosphotransfer enzymes on the surface of synaptic vesicles.DISCUSSIONSynapsins have been at the center of attention for many years because of their abundance, stoichiometric phosphorylation by multiple protein kinases, and strategic localization to synaptic vesicles. Few proteins are associated with so many detailed mechanistic models and postulated functions as synapsins. They have been implicated in neurogenesis, gene expression, axonal extension, synaptogenesis, and neurotransmitter release (for a review of these proposed extended functions, see Ref. 10Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Analyses of knockout mice that lack synapsins confirmed an essential role in regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis and suggested a primary, possibly exclusive, function for synapsins in the mature nerve terminal (13Rosahl T.W. Geppert M. Spillane D. Herz J. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, these and many of the other studies on synapsins, although technically elegant, failed to reveal the molecular nature of synapsin action because they suffered from limitations that made precise functional definitions difficult. These limitations include the use of synapsin fragments that contain parts of domains instead of complete domains, the high surface activity of synapsins (27Ho M. Bahler M. Czernik A.J. Schiebler W. Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5600-5607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may explain why synapsins bind with a high apparent affinity to so many different proteins (especially cytoskeletal elements (28Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar)), and the use of complex biological systems in which direct and indirect effects are difficult to distinguish (13Rosahl T.W. Geppert M. Spillane D. Herz J. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have now attempted to overcome these limitations by correlating structural and functional approaches. Our data show that synapsins are ATP-binding proteins that are differentially regulated by Ca2+ and may serve as phosphotransfer enzymes.The crystal structure of the C-domain from synapsin I demonstrated that it constitutes an autonomous, independently folding domain (16Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The C-domain is a dimer in which the amino and carboxyl termini of each subunit are in close proximity. Comparison of the C-domain structure with data bases uncovered a high degree of structural similarity to a group of enzymes: glutathione synthetase,d-alanine:d-alanine ligase, biotin carboxylase α-chain, succinyl-CoA synthetase β-chain, and pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase. All of these enzymes bind ATP and transfer phosphate from bound ATP to a substrate (17Matsuda K. Mizuguchi K. Nishioka T. Kato H. Go N. Oda J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data raise a number of questions. Do synapsins bind ATP? What are the relative ATP binding properties and affinities of different synapsins? Is ATP binding to synapsins regulated by Ca2+? We have now addressed these issues to explore the functional implications of the structural observations. Our data showed that the C-domains of both synapsins bind ATP, but not GTP, with similar high affinity, thereby characterizing synapsins as ATP-utilizing proteins on the vesicle surface.Although we were unable to measure ATPase activity in synapsins, the following data support the notion that ATP binding to synapsins is part of an enzyme reaction. 1) All five proteins to which the three-dimensional structure of C-domains is closely related are ATPases. 2) In glutathione synthase andd-alanine:d-alanine ligase, a flexible catalytic loop with a central arginine/lysine residue is essential for activity. The synapsin I C-domain has a flexible loop at the same position that is 100% conserved in synapsin II and also contains a central lysine residue. 3) Synapsins bind ADP with a much lower affinity than ATP, indicating that after hydrolysis, ADP would be exchanged for ATP. The fact that we could not detect ATPase activity in synapsins is not surprising because the enzymes to which synapsins are structurally homologous transfer the phosphate to the substrate and would not be expected to be active in the absence of substrate. Together our data suggested that synapsins are probably dimeric enzymes of unknown substrate specificity on the vesicle surface.This description paints a unitary view of synapsins in agreement with their high degree of homology. Unexpectedly, however, we found that ATP binding was differentially regulated in the two synapsins despite their similar ATP affinity. Ca2+ was required for ATP binding to synapsin I but not synapsin II. The difference in regulation could be traced to a single amino acid difference between the two synapsins: Glu373 in synapsin I, which corresponds to Lys374 in synapsin II. Substitution of Glu373to a lysine converted synapsin I into a Ca2+-independent ATP-binding protein. This finding has functional and evolutionary implications. Evolutionarily, it implies that synapsins I and II co-evolved with the C-domain as the main functional domain and that at some time a divergence in regulation occurred that is based on the substitution of a single amino acid. A similar evolutionary switch between Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent isoforms in a protein family by a change in a single amino acid was recently observed in synaptotagmins (26von Poser C. Ichtchenko K. Shao X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 272: 14314-14319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Functionally, this observation suggests that synapsin II may be constitutively active whereas synapsin I may only be activated upon increases in Ca2+. This hypothesis agrees well with the more severe phenotype of synapsin II knockouts than synapsin I knockouts, despite the greater abundance of synapsin I (14Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). A view of synapsins emerges from these studies in which the major central domain of synapsins, the C-domain, represents a differentially regulated ATP-binding domain that is flanked by amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions and may serve as a phosphotransfer enzyme of unknown specificity. Ever since their discovery as major brain phosphoproteins and abundant components of synaptic vesicles, synapsins have been intensely studied (1Johnson E.M. Ueda T. Maeno H. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5650-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, synapsins constitute a family of at least four homologous proteins (synapsins Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb; collectively referred to as synapsins I and II) that are derived by alternative splicing from the primary transcripts of two genes (3Südhof T.C.

The four synapsins are composed of common amino-terminal domains found in all synapsins (the short A- and B-domains and the long C-domain) and divergent carboxyl-terminal domains that are present in different combinations in each synapsin (D- to I-domains) (3Südhof T.C.

The C-domains account for more than half of the synapsin sequences and constitute their most conserved domain. In addition to the vertebrate synapsins, a synapsin gene was described in Drosophila; this gene also produces two protein products that differ at the carboxyl terminus (5Klagges B.R. Heimbeck G.

Only the C-domain is highly conserved between vertebrate and invertebrate synapsins, suggesting that it is the central functional domain. The four vertebrate synapsins are co-expressed in most neurons (6Ullrich B. Südhof T.C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They are substrates for multiple protein kinases. All synapsins contain a phosphorylation site for Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, and protein kinase A at the amino terminus (3Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A.

Furthermore, because the C-domains of synapsins I and II are highly homologous, the results with the synapsin I C-domain raised the question if synapsin II also binds ATP. We have now addressed these issues using recombinant C-domains from synapsins I and II. Our results show that all synapsins bind ATP; surprisingly, ATP binding is directly regulated by Ca2+ only in synapsin I but not synapsin II. The distinct regulatory properties of synapsins depend on a single, evolutionarily conserved amino acid, indicating an evolutionary selection of their separate regulatory properties. These data suggest that synapsins may be differentially regulated phosphotransfer enzymes on the surface of synaptic vesicles. DISCUSSIONSynapsins have been at the center of attention for many years because of their abundance, stoichiometric phosphorylation by multiple protein kinases, and strategic localization to synaptic vesicles. Few proteins are associated with so many detailed mechanistic models and postulated functions as synapsins. They have been implicated in neurogenesis, gene expression, axonal extension, synaptogenesis, and neurotransmitter release (for a review of these proposed extended functions, see Ref. 10Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Analyses of knockout mice that lack synapsins confirmed an essential role in regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis and suggested a primary, possibly exclusive, function for synapsins in the mature nerve terminal (13Rosahl T.W.

However, these and many of the other studies on synapsins, although technically elegant, failed to reveal the molecular nature of synapsin action because they suffered from limitations that made precise functional definitions difficult. These limitations include the use of synapsin fragments that contain parts of domains instead of complete domains, the high surface activity of synapsins (27Ho M. Bahler M. Czernik A.J. Schiebler W.

Our data show that synapsins are ATP-binding proteins that are differentially regulated by Ca2+ and may serve as phosphotransfer enzymes.The crystal structure of the C-domain from synapsin I demonstrated that it constitutes an autonomous, independently folding domain (16Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The C-domain is a dimer in which the amino and carboxyl termini of each subunit are in close proximity. Comparison of the C-domain structure with data bases uncovered a high degree of structural similarity to a group of enzymes: glutathione synthetase,d-alanine:d-alanine ligase, biotin carboxylase α-chain, succinyl-CoA synthetase β-chain, and pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase. All of these enzymes bind ATP and transfer phosphate from bound ATP to a substrate (17Matsuda K. Mizuguchi K. Nishioka T. Kato H. Go N. Oda J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data raise a number of questions. Do synapsins bind ATP? What are the relative ATP binding properties and affinities of different synapsins? Is ATP binding to synapsins regulated by Ca2+? We have now addressed these issues to explore the functional implications of the structural observations. Our data showed that the C-domains of both synapsins bind ATP, but not GTP, with similar high affinity, thereby characterizing synapsins as ATP-utilizing proteins on the vesicle surface.Although we were unable to measure ATPase activity in synapsins, the following data support the notion that ATP binding to synapsins is part of an enzyme reaction. 1) All five proteins to which the three-dimensional structure of C-domains is closely related are ATPases. 2) In glutathione synthase andd-alanine:d-alanine ligase, a flexible catalytic loop with a central arginine/lysine residue is essential for activity. The synapsin I C-domain has a flexible loop at the same position that is 100% conserved in synapsin II and also contains a central lysine residue. 3) Synapsins bind ADP with a much lower affinity than ATP, indicating that after hydrolysis, ADP would be exchanged for ATP. The fact that we could not detect ATPase activity in synapsins is not surprising because the enzymes to which synapsins are structurally homologous transfer the phosphate to the substrate and would not be expected to be active in the absence of substrate. Together our data suggested that synapsins are probably dimeric enzymes of unknown substrate specificity on the vesicle surface.This description paints a unitary view of synapsins in agreement with their high degree of homology. Unexpectedly, however, we found that ATP binding was differentially regulated in the two synapsins despite their similar ATP affinity. Ca2+ was required for ATP binding to synapsin I but not synapsin II. The difference in regulation could be traced to a single amino acid difference between the two synapsins: Glu373 in synapsin I, which corresponds to Lys374 in synapsin II. Substitution of Glu373to a lysine converted synapsin I into a Ca2+-independent ATP-binding protein. This finding has functional and evolutionary implications. Evolutionarily, it implies that synapsins I and II co-evolved with the C-domain as the main functional domain and that at some time a divergence in regulation occurred that is based on the substitution of a single amino acid. A similar evolutionary switch between Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent isoforms in a protein family by a change in a single amino acid was recently observed in synaptotagmins (26von Poser C. Ichtchenko K. Shao X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 272: 14314-14319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Functionally, this observation suggests that synapsin II may be constitutively active whereas synapsin I may only be activated upon increases in Ca2+. This hypothesis agrees well with the more severe phenotype of synapsin II knockouts than synapsin I knockouts, despite the greater abundance of synapsin I (14Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M.

Previously, we have shown that monoclonal antibodies established from arthritis prone DBA/1 mice require the triple-helical conformation of their epitopes for antigen recognition. Here, we present a novel approach to characterize arthritis-related conformational epitopes by preparing a panel of 130 chimeric collagen X/CII molecules. The insertion of a series of CII cassettes into the triple-helical recombinant collagen X allowed for the first time the identification of five triple-helical immunodominant domains of 5–11 amino acid length, to which 75% of 36 monoclonal antibodies bound. A consensus motif,“R G hydrophobic,” was found in all immunodominant epitopes. The antibodies were encoded by a certain combination of V-genes in germline configuration, indicating a role of the consensus motif in V-gene selection. The immunodominant domains are spread over the entire monomeric CII molecule with no apparent order; however, a highly organized arrangement became apparent when the CII molecules were displayed in the quarter-staggered assembly within a fibril. This discrete epitope organization most likely reflects structural constraints that restrict the exposure of CII epitopes on the surface of heterotypically assembled cartilage fibrils. Thus, our data suggest a preimmune B cell selection process that is biased by the accessibility of CII determinants in the intact cartilage tissue.

The driving force of this disorder is still obscure. However, immune responses toward cartilage-specific antigens, particularly B cell responses against type II collagen (CII), indicate a pathogenic role of cartilage-specific autoimmunity (2Clague R.B.

Immunization with CII is associated with development of autoimmune arthritis in several species (6Trentham D.E. Townes A.S. Kang A.H. J. Exp.

Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) shares many characteristics with human rheumatoid arthritis. As most extensively studied in mice, the development of CIA is strongly associated with certain MHC-II haplotypes (9Wooley P.H. Luthra H.S. Stuart J.M. David C.S. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 10Brunsberg U. Gustafsson K. Jansson L. Michaelsson E. Ahrlund Richter L. Pettersson S. Mattsson R. Holmdahl R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), indicating that the model is dependent on T cell recognition of a restricted set of CII peptides presented by appropriate MHC molecules (11Michaelsson E. Malmström V. Reis S. Engström A. Burkhardt H. Holmdahl R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 80: 745-749Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Indeed, peptides derived from the same region of CII (amino acid residues (aa) 256–270) are bound by both DR4 and Aq molecules (10Brunsberg U. Gustafsson K. Jansson L. Michaelsson E.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whose expression is genetically associated with rheumatoid arthritis and CIA, respectively.T cell recognition of proteolytically processed CII, however, does not meet all requirements for the development of arthritis. The induction of CIA, in fact, is critically dependent on immunization with CII in its native conformation, i.e. the intact triple-helical structure of collagen (6Trentham D.E. Townes A.S. Kang A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 13Terato K. Hasty K.A. Cremer M.A. Stuart J.M. Town A.S. Kang A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The conformation requirements, as well as the dependence on functional B cells (14Holmdahl R. Rubin K. Klareskog L. Larsson E. Wigzell H. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 15Holmdahl R. Mo J.A. Jonsson R. Karlström K. Scheynius A. Autoimmunity. 1991; 10: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), indicate that autoreactive CII-specific B cells are crucial to the pathogenesis of CIA. In high responder mice such as DBA/1 (H2q), for example, there is apparent lack of negative selection of CII autoreactive B cells. As a consequence, immunization of DBA/1 mice with heterologous (rat) CII gives rise to early activation (day 5–9 after immunization) of IgG-secreting autoreactive B cells; these recognize a set of immunodominant native structures on the triple-helical moiety of the autologous CII molecule (14Holmdahl R. Rubin K. Klareskog L. Larsson E. Wigzell H. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 16Holmdahl R. Jansson L. Larsson A. Jonsson R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1990; 31: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The autoantibodies are cross-reactive with CII from various species (i.e. human, chick, and bovine), but, within the same species, they do not cross-react with any of the systemically available collagens, for example type I (CI), despite a homology of 80% at the amino acid level, suggesting that CI-reactive B cells might have been negatively selected. The pathogenic potential of CII-specific autoantibodies, in turn, is indicated by the fact that, after intraperitoneal injection into syngeneic mice, they bind to articular cartilage (15Holmdahl R. Mo J.A. Jonsson R. Karlström K. Scheynius A. Autoimmunity. 1991; 10: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and induce synovial inflammation and even erosive arthritis (15Holmdahl R.

For this purpose, epitope mapping was performed on a collection of B cell hybridomas isolated from lymph nodes and spleens of arthritis-prone DBA/1 mice on day 9–11 following immunization (14Holmdahl R.

This collection of mAbs is well characterized in terms of binding to intact articular cartilage, arthritogenic potential, and representation of immunodominant epitopes (16Holmdahl R. Jansson L.

Since all antibodies bind in a conformation-dependent manner, attempts to map epitopes by synthetic peptides or purified enzymatic collagen fragments have achieved rather limited results (21Burkhardt H.

Therefore, we have established a method that allows the construction of recombinant homotrimeric collagen chimeras; this approach is based on the mutagenesis of the α1(X) collagen chain, allowing the presentation of epitopes in triple-helical conformation. This enables to characterize precisely the conformation-dependent binding of 36 mAbs and to identify the immunodominant B cell epitopes of CIA in DBA/1 mice, giving insight into the structural basis of autoimmune recognition of the most abundant collagen type in the joints.RESULTSAntibody Specificity for Collagen IIThe CII-specific B cell hybridomas, derived from DBA/1 mice during the primary or secondary response upon immunization with rat or chick CII, produced 45 mAbs that bound with similar avidity to CII from chicken, mouse, rat, and human, as determined by ELISA (data not shown); they did not cross-react with ubiquitously expressed collagens such as type I (Fig. 1 A). Two mAbs (D3 and C2), however, cross-reacted with native collagen XI (data not shown), which contains one α1 (II) chain as a subunit of its heterotrimeric structure (35Burgeson R.E. Hollister D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A representative example (mAb F4) for antibody specificity is shown in Fig. 1 A.Antibody Specificity for the Native Conformation of Collagen IIAll mAbs bound in a conformation-dependent manner to CII, i.e. they required the triple helix of the epitope, as shown in a representative ELISA with native and heat-denatured CII for mAb D3 (Fig. 1 B). The binding ability of mAb D3 was lost after denaturation. The control antibodies, i.e. the isotype-matched mAb B1, recognizing a linear collagen epitope (Fig.1 B), and a CII-specific polyclonal rabbit antibody, did bind to CII under all conditions tested (results not shown). Heat-denatured CII was exposed to antibodies at 37 °C, and not at room temperature, to prevent refolding of the collagen triple helix.In Vivo Effects of the CII-specific Monoclonal AntibodiesAntibody BindingThe intraperitoneal injection of the biotinylated mAbs E8, D3, and C2, but not that of the control mAb F3 (which does not bind to CII), led to antibody binding to the articular cartilage. In the case of the mAb D3, the binding could be considered specific because blocked by an anti-idiotypic antiserum in vivo (36Mo J.A. Scheynius A. Nilsson S. Holmdahl R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1994; 39: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Single staining with avidin-peroxidase confirmed the binding of the biotin-conjugated anti-CII mAbs, leaving the synovia unstained, as expected (data not shown).Induction of Synovial InflammationThe intraperitoneal administration of the CII-specific mAbs led to an inflammatory response in the synovial membrane (Fig. 2), consisting of hyperplasia and inflammatory infiltration. The inflammatory infiltrate included lymphocyte-like cells positive for the T helper cell marker CD4 (Fig. 2 A) and macrophage-like cells expressing CD11b (C3bi receptor) and MHC-II (Fig. 2, B andC, respectively). No staining of the cartilage matrix or signs of inflammatory responses were detected after systemic administration of the biotin-conjugated control mAb F3 (results not shown).Figure 2A, synovial hyperplasia and infiltration by CD4-positive lymphocytes induced by the anti-CII specific mAb D3.

The double staining with avidin-peroxidase visualizes mAb binding to cartilage (ca); staining with anti-CD4 IgG shows infiltration of CD4-positive lymphocyte-like cells (arrowheads) within the hyperplastic synovia (s).

For this purpose, a 295-bp-long α1(X) fragment flanked by the unique restriction sites PstI and BamHI, or a 338-bp-long cassette generated by restriction with NcoI andBamHI, was replaced by PCR-amplified α1(II) inserts of varying length. Initially, constructs were generated that contained larger α1(II) inserts (up to 900 bp), to cover the entire length of the CII molecule with a few recombinant collagen molecules. Subsequently, a total of 130 recombinant chimeras were constructed to localize the B cell epitopes precisely on different recombinant chimeric collagen molecules containing α1(II) inserts with only small sequence overlaps. To maintain stable triple helices, the recombinant collagen chimeras were constructed without interfering with the Gly-X-Y sequence. Collagen X was chosen, since it is a homotrimeric molecule and none of the mAbs cross-reacted with this collagen type (Fig. 1 A). Recombinant chimeric collagen II/X molecules were produced by transfection of HEK 293 cells with chimeric constructs and expression under the cytomegalovirus promoter. The Western blot in Fig. 3, developed with the collagen X-specific mAb X53, demonstrates the differences in electrophoretic mobility of the recombinant collagen X chimeras depending on the varying length of α1(II) inserts (bp positions as in Ref 37Baldwin C.T.

HEK 293 cells were transfected with different type II/type X chimeric collagen constructs; the resulting chimeras were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electroblotting to a nitrocellulose filter, the chimeras were stained with the collagen X-specific mAb X53. Differences in electrophoretic mobility are due to the different length of the CII inserts. Lane a, recombinant collagen X. Between the unique restriction sitesPstI and BamHI of the α1(X) cDNA, 291 bp of the wild type sequence were replaced by α1(II) cDNA fragments differing in size: bp 2592–2675 (lane b), bp 1584–1748 (lane c), and bp 2583–3035 (lane e). Inlane d, the restriction cleavage of α1(X) cDNA was performed with NcoI and BamHI; 336 bp of the excised wild type sequence were replaced by an α1(II) cDNA insert between bp 3240 and 3548.

Cell culture medium was coated to ELISA plates and coating efficiency controlled by a specific anti-CX mAb prior to the mAb testing. From the original 45 hybridomas, 9 mAbs showed high background reactivity and were not further investigated. For the remaining 36 mAbs, epitopes were mapped by constructing a series of overlapping fragments. After testing these fragments by ELISA, the mAb binding sites were thereby narrowed down to stretches of 5–14 aa within the CII triple helix. TableI summarizes the binding properties of six representative mAbs to a selected number of chimeras.The minimal CII-specific sequences required for recognition are highlighted in Table I. These binding regions for representative mAbs were defined as epitopes C1III, J1, D3, E/F10I, E/F10II, and F4. Remarkably, the epitopes E/F10I and E/F10II differed only by 1 aa. An even subtler microdiversity in antibody recognition could be detected in the region of the C1III epitope, as revealed by the reactivity of the mAbs C1, LN 2.7, and CB300 (Fig.4). Three overlapping, but nevertheless clearly distinct epitopes (C1I, C1II, and C1III) were identified between bp positions 1623 and 1655 (aa 359–369).Figure 4Microdiversity of mAb specificity for one of the immunodominant regions on CII, shown for the representative mAbs C1, LN2.7, and CB300. The bars indicate mean absorbance at 405 nm (± S.D.) for a representative ELISA experiment in quadruplicates. Three epitope specificities (C1I, C1II, and C1III) could be distinguished in the region between bp 1620 and 1657 of the α1(II) cDNA (corresponding to aa 359–369 of the triple-helical portion of CII). While mAb CB300 only bound to the construct encoded by the entire region between bp 1623 and 1655 (C1III), mAb LN2.7 also bound to a 9-bp shorter derivative (1623–1646) (C1II); the epitope specificity of mAb C1 is sufficiently defined by a construct harboring the α1(II) sequence bp 1623–1637 (C1I). None of the mAbs bound to a construct starting at bp position 1629, indicating the importance of the sequence 1623–1629 bp (corresponding to aa 359–360) for all epitopes. No significant differences in absorbance were detectable with the CX specific mAb X53 (data not shown), thereby excluding any bias by a variation in the coating efficiency between the chimeric collagens.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The extensive mapping strategy using the entire set of recombinant chimeras was applied on each of the 36 mAbs; a summary of the results is given in Fig. 6 and Table II, which also contains the information about the V-gene usage of the CII-specific B cells (20Mo J.A. Holmdahl R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2440-2448PubMed Google Scholar). From the data of Table II, it is evident that the epitopes presented in Table I and Fig. 4 are indeed dominant targets of the B cell response, since each was recognized by more than one mAb.Figure 6Distribution of antibody binding along the entire triple helix of monomeric CII. The position of the antibody epitopes within the entire sequence of the CII triple helix is shown on the x axis. In addition to the amino acid numbering, the borders of cyanogen bromide fragments (CB) on CII are indicated to facilitate localization of the epitopes. On the Y axis is shown the number of mAbs binding to a particular site along the CII molecule. The bold bars represent antibodies with exactly determined epitopes (length < 14 aa residues). These mAbs bind to determinants that are recognized by more than one mAb and represent the eight major epitopes in five immunodominant domains regions (designated C1I-III, J1, D3, E/F10I-II, and F4) since a region on CB10 (E/F10I-II: aa 776–783) and another on CB11 (C1I-III: aa 357–368) contain overlapping epitopes. The C1I-III domain is the most frequently recognized region. Fifteen mAbs (41.7% of the total) bind to this site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IISummary of the epitope specificity of the entire anti-CII mAb collectionView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The binding regions of mAbs recognized by only one antibody (Table II) were not systematically mapped; however, the localization of their epitopes was confined to regions shorter than 50 aa with a few exceptions (M2 136, M2 191, and LN2; Ref. 15Holmdahl R. Mo J.A. Jonsson R. Karlström K. Scheynius A. Autoimmunity. 1991; 10: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These singly recognized epitopes turned out to spread along the entire triple helix and could be localized on all cyanogen bromide fragments (CB) of CII.The specificities of the remaining 27 mAbs were clustered to eight major epitopes (Table II) and localized in five distinct regions (C1I-III, J1, D3, E/F10I-II, and F4) on the CB11, CB10, and CB9. These immunodominant regions were not only characterized by binding of several antibodies to one epitope, but also by clustering of overlapping, yet distinct epitopes. This was most impressive in the dominant region within the CB11 fragment (C1I-III). Within this 11 aa stretch (aa 359–369), three different epitopes were recognized by as many as 15 mAbs,i.e. 41.7% of the entire collection. Two overlapping epitopes differing only by 1 aa were also localized on CB10 (aa 776–783), in close vicinity to the collagenase cleavage site (aa 775; Refs. 38Miller E.J. Harris Jr., E.D. Chung E.

The aa sequences characteristic of the immunodominant regions are shown in Fig. 5 A.Figure 5A, amino acid sequences of the immunodominant B cell epitopes on CII. Eight distinct epitopes were identified on the CNBr-fragments CB11, CB10, and CB9. Microdiversity was found in the regions of aa 359–369 (C1I, C1II, C1III) and aa 776–783 (E/F10I, E/F10II). All epitopes contained a consensus motif R G hydrophobic (highlighted).B, schematic representation of the mAb epitope E/F10II on the surface of the triple-helical α1(II) molecule. In the upper part, the sequence of α1(II) is compared with the respective sequences of the heterotrimeric collagen I, to which the corresponding mAb E10 does not bind. In the lower part, the side chains of the aa residues are depicted on the cylindrical surface of the collagen molecules in triple-helical assembly, based on the model by Eble et al. (40Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Theopen circles represent the glycine residues that remain hidden in the cylinder axis. This presentation of the epitope localization demonstrates how the presence of the α2 chain interferes with the sterical conformation of the epitopes on the cylindrical surface of the triple helix.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sequence data revealed subtle differences in epitope specificity, as recognized by the mAb binding to the dominant region C1I-III in CB11. The minimal requirements for antibody recognition (C1I epitope) were determined by 5 aa residues (ARGLT), the two other epitopes (C1I and C1II) were dependent on one or two additional turns of Gly-X-Y along the triple helix. A similar fine specificity was indicated by the critical dependence of anti-CII mAb binding on one leucine residue, whose absence determined the difference between epitopes E/F10I and E/F10II. However, despite such subtle differences, all dominant epitopes shared a consensus motif R G hydrophobic, as indicated in Fig.5 A.For the understanding of specific collagen binding, however, one has to consider not only the linear sequences, but also the array of aa side chains on the surface of the triple helix. While the glycine residues remain hidden in the axis of the homotrimeric triple helix and do not contribute to mAb binding, the residues in the X andY positions are exposed on the cylindrical surface of the molecule. This structural arrangement is schematically presented for the epitope E/F10II in Fig. 5 B, based on a previously described model (40Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the primary sequence of the E/F10II epitope differs from the corresponding region on the α1(I) chain of collagen I by only one conservative aa exchange, the triple-helical arrangement reveals considerable differences in the array of aa side chains on surface between the homotrimeric CII and the heterotrimeric CI.New aspects on the peculiarity of the CII epitope localization and their accessibility to antibodies became apparent when the epitopes were depicted within the 4.40 D-staggered arrangement of CII molecules in the microfibril (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the epitopes E/F10I-II and F4 on one CII molecule were located in the immediate vicinity of J1 and D3 on the adjacent molecule, close to the borders between gap and overlap zones. Thus, the distribution of the immunodominant domains exhibited a higher degree of order within the quarternary arrangement of collagen; this arrangement exists in intact cartilage tissue but obviously not in the monomeric CII molecule used as arthritogen. Remarkably, the F4/D3 epitope cluster was located close to sites of cross-link formation (Fig. 7 B), while E/F10I-II/J1 was adjacent to the collagenase cleavage site, suggesting a higher accessibility of these regions to enzymes and antibodies (see “Discussion”).Figure 7A, epitope localization in the collagen fibril.

https://openalex.org/W2059221487,"The p50 subunit of NF-κB is generated by proteolytic processing of a 105-kDa precursor (p105) in yeast and mammalian cells. Here we show that yeast mutants in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inhibit or abolish p105 processing. Specifically, p105 processing is inhibited by a mutation in a 20 S proteasome subunit (<i>pre1-1</i>), by mutations in the ATPases located in the 19 S regulatory complexes of the proteasome (<i>yta1, yta2/sug1, yta5, cim5</i>), and by a mutation in a proteasome-associated isopeptidase (<i>doa4</i>). A ubiquitinated intermediate of the p105 processing reaction accumulates in some of these mutants, strongly suggesting that ubiquitination is required for processing. However, none of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme mutants tested (<i>ubc1, -2, -3, -4/5, -6/7, -8, -9, -10, -11</i>) had an effect on p105 processing, suggesting that more than one of these enzymes is sufficient for p105 processing. Interestingly, a mutant ""N-end rule"" ligase does not adversely affect p105 processing, showing that the N-end rule pathway is not involved in degrading the C-terminal region of p105. Unexpectedly, we found that a glycine-rich region of p105 that is required for p105 processing in mammalian cells is not required for processing in yeast. Thus, p105 processing in both yeast and mammalian cells requires the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but the mechanisms of processing, while similar, are not identical."

Connexin 32-aequorin and connexin 43-aequorin retained chemiluminescent activity whereas that of connexin 26-aequorin was negligible. Immunofluorescent staining of COS-7 cells expressing the chimerae showed they were targeted to the plasma membrane.

Gap junction intercellular channels allow the direct movement between neighboring cells of ions and small molecules generally less than 1 kDa (1Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). These cell-cell junctions are generally believed to underpin diverse integrative events such as tissue growth and differentiation (2Brissette J.L. Kumar K.M. Gilula N.B. Hall J.E. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6453-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the co-ordination of cardiac and smooth muscle cells (3Christ G.J. Spray D.C. El-Sabban M. Moore L.K. Brink P.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 631-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thirteen highly related rodent connexin gap junction proteins have been identified (4Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Connexins traverse the lipid bilayer four times with the amino and carboxyl tails facing the cytoplasm; the third membrane traverse M3 is postulated to line the channel (5Unwin N. Neuron. 1989; 3: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The main determinant of the molecular mass of connexins is the length of the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail, with amino acid sequence variation confined mainly to the single intracellular loop and carboxyl tail. The two outer “gap” facing loops facilitate the recognition and docking of hexameric connexon hemichannels contributed by adjacent cells (6Warner A. Clements D.K. Parikh S. Evans W.H. DeHaan R.L. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The docking and tight adhesion of aligned connexons in the plasma membrane results in the insulated extension of two transmembrane channels across the intercellular gap and is the final act in the assembly of connexins into gap junctions. Calcium plays a central role in cellular communication, as shown by its demonstration as a key cytoplasmic factor in the control of junctional communication with increased intracellular calcium levels reducing gap junctional communication (7Loewenstein W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 829-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) by inducing transitions between apparent open and closed configurations of the channel (8Unwin P.N.T. Ennis P.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium oscillations have been shown to spread as waves across groups of attached glial (9Charles A.C. Merrill J.E. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (10Drumheller P.D. Hubbell J.A. Arterioscler. Thrombosis. 1991; 11: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These intercellular calcium waves proceed mainly via gap junctions, but the candidate-signaling component allowing intercellular crosstalk may not be calcium but a more global messenger molecule such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (11Carter T.D. Chen X.Y. Carlile G. Kalapothakis E. Ogden D. Evans W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1765-1773PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium may also be a crucial environmental factor at intracellular sites such as the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi environs, where the oligomerization of connexins into hexameric connexons is thought to occur. Many calcium-binding proteins, some with chaperone-like functions, are localized to this region of the secretory pathway and roles in the oligomerization of virally encoded proteins have been demonstrated (12Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The involvement of calcium in connexin oligomerization, a prelude to gap junction biogenesis, may be either direct or indirect and can involve a role for accessory proteins such as calmodulin. Calmodulin regulates junctional physiology in a variety of physiological systems (14Sasaki Y. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and calmodulin binding domains in connexins have been delineated (15Torok K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, knowledge of the calcium levels in the vicinity of the gap junctions and their connexin/connexon precursors will help to elucidate its relevance in the control of cell to cell signaling through gap junctions. The first application of aequorin as a calcium-sensitive reporter, demonstrating the importance of free ionized Ca2+ in the gating of gap junction channels, was in 1975 by Rose and Loewenstein (16Rose B. Loewenstein W.R. Nature. 1975; 254: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Since then, aequorin has been targeted to a number of organelles,e.g. mitochondria (17Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), endoplasmic reticulum (18Kendall J.M. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), where it has been used to report the subcellular calcium environment. In the present work, we have adopted a similar approach by attaching aequorin to the carboxyl tail of connexins 26, 32, and 43 targeted to gap junctions. We then have analyzed the expression and functionality of the chimeric products in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes (22Dahl G. Miller T. Paul D. Voellmy R. Werner R. Science. 1987; 236: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The results show that functional gap junction channels were constructed in mammalian and amphibian cells.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and Cx43 (25Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) using a two-step PCR procedure (26Sala-Newby G. Campbell A.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The first step generated cDNA products containing overlapping regions of 3′-connexin minus the stop codon and 5′-aequorin minus the start codon. The chimeric cDNAs were produced by a second PCR reaction, using equimolar amounts of the initial PCR products and the 5′-connexin primer and the 3′-aequorin primer. The primers used were as follows:Cx32P1, T7 promoter and first 15 bp of Cx32 (5′-CAG CTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA ATG AAC TGG ACA GGT); Cx32P2, first 15 bp of Aeq (-ATG) and last 15bp of CX32 (-TAA) (5′-TGA TGT AAG CTT GAC GCA GGC TGA TCG GTC); Aeq32, reverse ofCx32P2; Cx26P1, T7 promoter and first 15 bp of Cx26 (5′-CAG CTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA GGA TCC ATGGAT TGG GGC ACA); Cx26P2, first 15bp Aeq (−ATG) and last 15 bp of CX26 (−TAA) (5′-CAG CGG ATC CTT AGA CTG GTC TTT T);Aeq26, reverse of Cx26P2; Cx43P1, SP6 promoter and first 15 bp of Cx43 (5′-CAG CGA TTT AGG TGA CAC TAT AGA GAT CTA GAATGG GTG ACT GGA GT;)Cx43P2, first 15 bp of Aeq (−ATG) and last 15 bp of CX43 (−TAA) (5′-TGA TGT AAG CTT GAC AAT CTC CAG GTC ATC); Aeq43, reverse of Cx43P2; Aeq5, T7 promoter and first 15 bp of Aeq (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAA ATG GTC AAG CTT ACA TGA GAC TTC GAC); Aeq10, last 15 bp of aequorin including stop codon (5′-CTC CTT GAG CTC GTC GAC TTA GGG GAC AGC TCC AC). The external primers contain BamHI (Cx26P1, Cx32P1) or BglII restriction enzyme sites (Cx43P1, Aeq10) to enable cloning and characterization of clones. The chimeric PCR products were cloned directly into a TA cloning plasmid, PCR3 (Invitrogen). This plasmid has a T7 promoter and cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, thus allowing analysis of expression both in vitro and in vivo. Positive clones were identified by miniplasmid preparations and restriction enzyme analysis (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The selected constructs were sequenced using the PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer), and the results confirmed that no mutations were present. For analysis in vitro, several clones were selected for each chimera. Proteins expressed in a TNT system were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and were fixed, enhanced, and vacuum-dried prior to autoradiography. Aliquots of TNT product (10 μl) were reconstituted in a buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 1 μmcoelenterazine, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Calcium-sensitive chemiluminescent activity of proteins was analyzed in a luminometer (29Shimomura O. Musicki B. Kishi Y. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Campbell A.K. J. Biolum. Chemilum. 1988; 2 (188): 188Google Scholar). For analysis in vivo, COS-7 cells (4 × 105cells), in six-well dishes, were transfected with 5 μg of the relevant plasmid DNA using calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in 500 μl of hypo-osmotic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% gelatin) and freeze/thawed three times followed by brief sonication. Total cell protein (100 ng) was reactivated and analyzed for calcium-sensitive light as described above. For the aequorin-related Ca2+ measurements, COS-7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of Cx43-Aeq DNA, or were infected with a replication-deficient adenovirus vector expressing a cytosolic luciferase-aequorin chimera (31Kendall J.M. Badminton M.N. Sala-Newby G.B. Wilkinson G.W.G. Campbell A.K. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 133-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were detached in cold phosphate-buffered saline (120 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4·2H2O, pH 7.4), containing 1 mm EDTA, and seeded onto glass coverslips. To increase expression of the recombinant proteins, 5 mm sodium butyrate was included in the culture medium for 18 h prior to the experiments (32Wilkinson G.W.G. Akrigg A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2233-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the recombinant apoaequorins were converted into photoproteins by addition of coelenterazine (final concentration 5 μm) for 4 h at 37 °C before experiments. In experiments in which aequorin was used to measure free Ca2+ under the plasma membrane, activation with coelenterazine was conducted in the presence of 1 mmEGTA (21Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Coverslips were inverted over the reservoir of a plastic perfusion chamber (maintained at 37 °C in a dark box) and brought into contact with a fiber optics bundle attached to a photon counting camera (Photek three-microchannel plate intensified CCD camera (Photek 216)) (33Campbell A.K. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were perfused for at least 10 min in KRH (120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.3 mm CaCl2; for subplasma membrane measurements, CaCl2 was substituted by 1 mm EGTA) to remove excess coelenterazine. The fractional discharge of aequorin was calculated from the total light emitted by the photoprotein at the end of each experiment, by exposing the cells to water containing 5 mm CaCl2 to discharge unconsumed aequorin. This value was used to convert light emission into free Ca2+(34Cobbold P.H. Lee J.A.C. McCormack J.G Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 55-80Google Scholar). Identical calibration curves for aequorin and Cx43-Aeq were obtained as described in Ref. 35Badminton M.N. Campbell A.K. Rembold C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31210-31214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. For Western blot analysis, 100-mm dishes containing COS-7 cells were transfected with 20 μg of the relevant cDNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in 500 μl of 40 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, and chymostatin and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A) and freshly prepared phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), left for 1 min at room temperature, and homogenized through a 16-mm gauge needle followed by brief sonication. Cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 500 × g to remove nuclei, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 25,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of a solubilizing buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Aliquots (10 μl) were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis. Proteins were characterized using a primary rabbit anti-aequorin antibody (31Kendall J.M. Badminton M.N. Sala-Newby G.B. Wilkinson G.W.G. Campbell A.K. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 133-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and secondary horse radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. For immunolocalization, COS-7 cells were plated onto 16-mm2coverslips in 12-well dishes and transfected with 5 μg of the relevant cDNA. Cells were fixed 48 h after transfection in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mlysine in phosphate-buffered saline. The cellular localization of the chimeric proteins was determined using a monoclonal Cx32 antibody (generated to a sequence on the intracellular loop) or a monoclonal Cx43 antibody (generated to a sequence on the carboxyl tail). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to the intracellular loop of Cx26 was also used (36Becker D.L. Evans W.H. Green C.R. Warner A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1455-1467PubMed Google Scholar). Aequorin was localized using a rabbit anti-aequorin antibody (31Kendall J.M. Badminton M.N. Sala-Newby G.B. Wilkinson G.W.G. Campbell A.K. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 133-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with 20 μg of relevant Cx-Aeq DNA in the PCR3 plasmid as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were split into selective media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate) and clonally propagated (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 7: 2745-2753Crossref Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Clones were selected on the basis of their aequorin activity. The ability to form functional gap junction channels was assessed by microinjection of confluent cell monolayers with 5% w/v Lucifer yellow CH in 0.3 m LiCl, followed by examination by fluorescence microscopy using a 440-nm filter. The cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min, mounted under 16-mm2 coverslips, and the number of injected cells transferring dye counted. In control experiments, dye transfer was assessed in cells incubated with 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (1 μm) for 30 min, a potent blocker of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (38Munari-Silen Y. Lebrethon M.C. Morand I. Rousset B. Saez J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To express the chimerae in Xenopus oocytes, each wild-type and chimeric cDNA was transferred into theBglII site of the Melton-derived plasmid pBSKXG (39Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This flanked the chimeric DNA inserts with the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene to improve the efficiency of translation in oocytes. Wild-type and chimeric Cx-Aeq cDNAs were linearized with ClaI and sense transcribed with T7 polymerase in the presence of the cap analogue m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (Boehringer Mannheim). After DNase digestion and purification, cRNAs were quantified by absorbance (260 nm) and the proportion of full-length transcripts (>95%) was checked in 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Oocytes were prepared for injection as described previously (40Barrio L.C. Suchyna T. Bargiello T. Xu L.X. Roginski R.S. Bennett M.V.L. Nicholson B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8410-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and co-injected with an antisense oligonucleotide (10 ng/oocyte) directed againstXenopus Cx38 mRNA to block endogenous expression (40Barrio L.C. Suchyna T. Bargiello T. Xu L.X. Roginski R.S. Bennett M.V.L. Nicholson B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8410-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and the cRNAs (0.1–1.0 μg/μl; 50 nl/oocyte) encoding the chimeric and wild-type connexins. Vitelline membranes were removed in hypertonic solution 24 h after injection, and pairs of oocytes were placed in contact (22Dahl G. Miller T. Paul D. Voellmy R. Werner R. Science. 1987; 236: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Junctional conductance developed between oocyte pairs was recorded 24–72 h after pairing using the dual voltage clamp technique with two independent amplifiers (TEV-200, Dagan). Each cell of the pair was impaled with two microelectrodes (0.5–1 megohm) filled with 2 m KCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mmHepes pH 7.2. Junctional conductance was measured as follows;V 1, I 1,V 2, and I 2 are voltages and currents, with the holding current subtracted, in oocyte 1 and 2, respectively. Initially both oocytes were clamped at the same holding potential (V m, e.g. −40 mV), when the transjunctional voltage (V j ) was zero sinceV j = V 1 −V 2. A voltage step, applied in oocyte 1, defined positive V j as greater relative positivity in oocyte 1. The current injected in oocyte 2, I 2,i.e. to hold its potential constant, was equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the current flowing through the junctional channels (I j = −I 2). Thus, the macroscopic junctional conductance was directly calculated asI j /V j. The stimulation and data collection were carried out with a PC-AT computer using pCLAMP software and Digidata 1200-A interface (Axon Instrument Inc.). The chimeric proteins were initially characterized after TNT to determine their molecular mass and whether functionality of the aequorin partner was retained. Chimeric proteins of the predicted size were synthesized from the three chimeric constructs, namely Cx26-Aeq (47 kDa), Cx32-Aeq (53 kDa), and Cx43-Aeq (64 kDa) (data not shown). Aequorin activity of Cx43-Aeq and Cx32-Aeq was comparable to that of wild-type aequorin, but chemiluminescence of Cx26-Aeq chimera was markedly reduced. The effect of fusion of aequorin to Cx26 on its chemiluminescence was investigated by PCR amplification of the chimera and the aequorin partner of each chimera. The PCR products were analyzed for aequorin activity in the TNT translation assay. The aequorin partner amplified from Cx26-Aeq gave comparable aequorin activity (62 ± 1.5%) to Cx32-Aeq (78 ± 6.4%) and Aeq-WT (100%). However, chemiluminescence obtained with the full-length Cx26-Aeq construct was only 1.3 ± 0.1% of Aeq-WT activity. These results show that fusion of aequorin to the carboxyl terminus of connexin 26 inhibited aequorin activityin vitro. Indirect immunofluorescence of transfected COS-7 cells indicated that Cx32-Aeq and Cx43-Aeq chimerae were targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig.2 a). Furthermore, double immunofluorescence with aequorin and connexin antibodies showed that aequorin was localized to the same region of the cell as its connexin partner (data not shown). Thus, the results demonstrated that the two chimeric proteins were located at the plasma membrane and at intracellular locations, especially in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi environs of the cell, as established by immunostaining with antibodies to TGN38, a Golgi marker (41Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although Cx26 was localized by immunocytochemistry using an intracellular loop domain antibody (Des 3) (36Becker D.L. Evans W.H. Green C.R. Warner A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1455-1467PubMed Google Scholar), co-localization of the connexin and aequorin components of Cx26-Aeq could not be demonstrated since no signal was detected with aequorin antibodies. Transfected cells also expressed chimeric proteins of the predicted size for Cx26-Aeq, Cx32-Aeq, and Cx43-Aeq (Fig. 2 b). Analysis of aequorin activity in cell extracts showed the activity in chimerae of Cx43 and Cx32 was comparable to Aeq-WT, but that in Cx26-Aeq transfected cells was low (TableI). The overall levels of aequorin activity of the chimerae, compared with Aeq-WT, were Cx43-Aeq > Cx32-Aeq > Cx26-Aeq. The results suggest that the nature of the connexin partner and thus the length of the carboxyl tail may influence the functionality (i.e. chemiluminescence) of the aequorin component of the chimeric proteins.Table IAequorin activity of chimeric proteins expressed in COS-7 cellsConstructAequorin activity%Cx26-Aeq6.02 ± 0.85Cx32-Aeq67.25 ± 7.25Cx43-Aeq88.5 ± 8.09Aeq-WT100 Open table in a new tab The orientation of the chimerae in the endoplasmic reticulum was examined by determining the aequorin activity of Cx32-Aeq in living cells (18Kendall J.M. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Native recombinant aequorin reactivated in the cytosol with its prosthetic group coelenterazine was used as a control (18Kendall J.M. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results showed that Cx32-Aeq had been correctly inserted into the membrane (data not shown). To study the formation of functional gap junction channels, stable HeLa cell lines expressing the chimeric proteins were generated and their intercellular communication properties assessed by Lucifer yellow transfer (Fig. 3 and TableII). Fig. 3 (A1 andA2) shows that two transfected HeLa cell lines expressing Cx43-Aeq (D7 and E9) transferred dye to up to 25 neighboring cells, whereas negligible dye transfer occurred in nontransfected cells (Fig.3, B1). Confirmation that direct communication had occurred between cells across gap junction channels was obtained by inhibition of dye transfer following incubation of the cells for 30 min with 18α glycyrrhetinic acid, an inhibitor of intercellular communication across gap junctions (Fig. 3, A3 and B2). Additionally, a correlation was noted between dye transfer and the level of aequorin expression (Table II). In HeLa cell line D7, which showed the higher aequorin activity, 74% of the cells injected with Lucifer yellow transferred dye to 10 or more cells. In cell line E9, which exhibited significantly lower aequorin activity, 59% of the cells transferred the dye to the same number of cells. Few (<2%) nontransfected HeLa cells transferred dye to neighboring cells. These results indicate that the expression properties of the two partners of the chimeric protein are closely linked. Thus, HeLa cells expressing Cx32-Aeq transferred the dye only when protein expression from the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter was stimulated by 5 mm sodium butyrate. No intercellular dye transfer was observed between HeLa cells expressing Cx26-Aeq.Table IIDye transfer and aequorin activity in HeLa cellsCell typeCells coupledAequorin activity%Wild type (n = 55)1.843 ± 8Cx43-Aeq (D7) (n = 69)7469,803 ± 2,782Cx43-Aeq (E9) (n = 68)5912,792 ± 2,072 Open table in a new tab The voltage gating properties of the channels formed by Cx43-Aeq and Cx32-Aeq were examined. To study the assembly of the chimerae into functional gap junctions alone (i.e. as homomeric channels) or in combination with wild-type connexins (i.e. as heterotypic and heteromeric channels), paired oocytes were injected with various combinations of connexin and Cx-Aeq cRNAs. Homomeric and heterotypic channel formation was determined by measuring the macroscopic junctional conductance. Formation of heteromeric channels was inferred by comparing the voltage gating properties of the junctions formed in pairs of oocytes expressing only wild-type connexins and the results obtained with pairs co-expressing the chimerae. To examine the formation of homotypic channels, paired oocytes were injected with equal amounts of the same connexin-aequorin chimera cRNA (Table III, a and b). Although large junctional conductances were induced by cRNA of wild-type connexins, pairs expressing Cx26-Aeq or Cx32-Aeq showed no detectable levels of electrical coupling. In contrast, pairs injected with Cx43-Aeq were electrically coupled, although junctional conductance was 1–2% of that of wild-type Cx43, despite the fact that both pairs expressed similar levels of connexins. These experiments show that expression of Cx26-Aeq and Cx32-Aeq in oocytes does not result in the formation of intercellular channels, whe"

To study further the importance of the alternative pathway of complement activation in vivo and to help elucidate any additional functions of factor B or its activation fragments we developed, by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, mice with a disrupted factor B gene. Factor B-deficient mice produced no detectable factor B mRNA or protein and had no detectable factor B enzymatic activity or alternative pathway function in their serum. Further studies revealed that the two adjacent genes, complement component C2 andD17H6S45, had been down regulated as a result of the disruption. The down-regulation of C2 gene expression was sufficient to cause a complete loss of classical pathway function as determined by the failure of sera from the deficient mice to opsonize antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes and by impairment of immune complex processing in vivo. The resulting mouse is deficient in both factor B and C2, and hence the alternative and classical pathways of complement activation, and adds to the repertoire of models for studying the in vivo role of complement in the immune system.

Atkinson J.P. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The primary role of the AP probably lies in the immediate response to local infection by extracellular pathogens and can proceed on many microbial surfaces in the absence of specific antibody. The AP is also activated after C3b deposition by the classical pathway of complement activation and serves to amplify the classical pathway response by depositing more C3b on the surface of immune complexes. Factor B is a serine protease that, in conjunction with C3b activated by the serine protease factor D, forms the C3/C5-convertase of the AP. Activation by factor D cleaves factor B into Ba, a small peptide released into the fluid phase, and Bb, which contains the serine protease domain and remains associated with C3b in the C3/C5-convertase. The murine factor B gene (H2-Bf) is located in the S region of the major histocompatibility complex class III region (2Chaplin D.D. Woods D.E. Whitehead A.S. Goldberger G. Colten H.R. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6947-6951Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).

Deficiencies of components of the AP are extremely rare, and those that have been described presented in patients with very severe neisserial infections.

Weiler J. Ackerman L. Barson B. Zhu Z.-B. Volanakis J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33 (abstr.): 68Google Scholar). In contrast, deficiencies of the classical pathway components are more common than those of the alternative pathway, and studies of humans with classical pathway component deficiencies have greatly increased our understanding of the roles of complement in vivo. Early classical pathway component deficiencies are strongly associated with immune complex-mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Complement-deficient humans (21Davies K.A. Erlendsson K. Beynon H.L.C. Peters A.M. Steinsson K. Valdimarsson H. Walport M.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3866-3873PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently a genetically engineered model of classical pathway deficiency, a C1q-deficient mouse (22Botto M. Nash J. Taylor P. Bygrave A. Pandolfi P.P. Loos M. Davies K.A. Walport M.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33 (abstr.): 71PubMed Google Scholar), have both been demonstrated to have abnormal immune complex processing. To further our understanding of the physiological roles of the alternative pathway and factor B in vivo, we generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells a mouse deficient in factor B by replacing exons 1 to 18 of the gene with a promoterlesslacZ reporter gene and the neomycin resistance gene.H2-Bf-deficient mice are fully viable when kept under specific pathogen-free conditions, and the disrupted allele was inherited in accordance with normal Mendelian patterns. The mice showed no gross phenotypic abnormalities; however, we found that the expression of the two neighboring genes, C2 andD17H6S45, was reduced and that the mice were functionally deficient in the classical as well as the alternative pathway. Mice with a disrupted H2-Bf locus were generated by homologous recombination in ES cells (23Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). The targeting vector pH2-Bf.lacZ/neo-HSVtk was constructed using isogenic DNA isolated from a 129/Sv genomic DNA λ library (Stratagene). All of the exons of H2-Bf from 1 to 18 (the last) corresponding to amino acids 4 onward and encompassing approximately 6 kb of genomic DNA were replaced with a 4.6-kb cassette consisting of a promoterlesslacZ reporter gene linked to a positively selectable marker, the neomycin resistance gene (neo) under the control of the pMC1 promoter. The lacZ/neo cassette was flanked on the 5′ side by a 4.6-kb region of genomic DNA from exon 9 of C2 to exon 1 of H2-Bf and on the 3′ side by a 2.8-kb genomic fragment from exon 18 of H2-Bf to exon 7 of theD17H6S45 gene. External to the 5′ region of homology with the target locus was placed a negatively selectable marker gene, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSVtk). ES cells were transfected by electroporation with the linearized targeting vector pH2-Bf.lacZ/neo-HSVtk. Colonies surviving positive/negative selection (24Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) were isolated and screened by Southern blot (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA using a 3′-external probe (P1) (Fig. 1 B). After identification of clones with a disrupted H2-Bf gene a 5′-external probe (P2) was used to confirm that genuine homologous recombination had occurred on both sides of the gene. A third probe within the targeting vector was used to confirm that the clones contained only the single copy of the targeting vector. Recombinant clones were microinjected into 3.5-day postcoitus blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice. The chimeric mice generated were bred with female C57BL/6 mice, and germline transmission was detected by the presence of agouti offspring, which were screened for the disrupted allele. All experimental animals were adults (between 8 and 12 weeks of age) and of a mixed genetic background, (129/Sv × C57BL/6) F2. Wild type (H2-Bf+/+) and heterozygous (H2-Bf+/−) littermates matched for sex and age were used as controls for H2-Bf-deficient (H2-Bf−/−) mice. For all in vitro hemolytic assays, male mice were used. When serum was required, blood samples were taken and left to coagulate on ice; the serum was used the same day and was kept on ice at all times. Total RNA was extracted from liver using guanidinium thiocyanate-CsCl density gradient centrifugation (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose 2.2 m formaldehyde gels and Northern blotted onto Hybond N+ (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK) nylon membranes. First strand cDNA synthesis was undertaken using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as directed by the manufacturer. For amplification of the C2 cDNA the primers C2/10 (5′-CATCTATGCTATTGGGGTGG-3′) and C2/13b (5′-CCGAGATAGCTTCAGCAAGGC-3′) were used to generate a product of 492 bp. The 5′-untranslated region of H2-Bf cDNA was amplified with the primers Bf/5′ (5′-TGTAGCCAGATCCAGCATTTG-3′) and Bf/1b (5′-TCTCCATTGTCATGGAAAGC-3′), producing a 118-bp product.D17H6S45 cDNA was amplified with the primersRd/8+ (5′-GAACACACTGTATGTGTATGG-3′) and Rd/10− (5′-CAAGGGAGCCCCAGACAGATT-3′), yielding a 262-bp product. The cDNA from the gene for complement component C4 (C4) was amplified with the primers C4/2+ (5′-GAAGGACTTTAAGCTGAGCTC-3′) and C4/3− (5′-CTGAGCTACCAGCTGGATGTG-3′), resulting in a 129-bp product. Control primers for the amplification of theC1qA gene that generated a fragment of 339 bp were:C1qAI/1 (5′-TGGACAGTGGCTGAAGATGTC-3′) andC1qAII/1 (5′-ATAACCACGTTGCCAAGCGCT-3′). The cDNA ofC2, D17H6S45, C4, C1qA, andH2-Bf were amplified under the same conditions (1 unit of BIOTaq DNA polymerase (Bioline UK Ltd.), 2.5 mmMg2+, 0.2 mm dNTPs) using 20, 25, and 30 thermocycles, to give an estimation of the relative quantities of message present, each one being co-amplified with the C1qAgene to control for variability in the cDNA synthesis and PCR reactions. A previously describedin vitro assay with a trypsin-activated cobra venom factor-dependent convertase complex was used to detect functional factor B activity in mouse serum (26Paolucci E.S. Shreffler D.C. Immunogenetics. 1983; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μl of 10% v/v mouse serum was incubated with 10 μl of 100 units/ml cobra venom factor (a kind gift from M. B. Pepys, Immunological Medicine, Imperial College School of Medicine), in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+, at 37 °C for 10 min and activated by incubation with 10 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). The trypsin was inhibited with 10 μl of 2.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), and the late components of complement were provided by the addition of 50 μl of 10 mm EDTA/normal human serum. Guinea pig erythrocytes (2 × 108 cells in 50 μl) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and the amount of lysis was determined by the absorption at 413 nm of the supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The classical pathway mediated total hemolytic complement activity in mouse serum was determined by release of 51Cr-labeled hemoglobin from antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes as described previously (27Andrews B.S. Theofilopoulos A.N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1978; 22: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The protocol for the alternative pathway hemolytic assay was the same as the total hemolytic activity assay except that a 5% v/v suspension of guinea pig erythrocytes in PBS, 0.007 m Mg2+, 0.01m EGTA (pH 7.2) was used instead of sensitized sheep erythrocytes, and the serum was preincubated in PBS, 0.007m Mg2+, 0.01 m EGTA (pH 7.2) to make the hemolytic assay specific for the alternative pathway. Sheep erythrocytes were sensitized with a subagglutinating titer of rabbit hemolytic serum (TCS, Buckinghamshire, UK). 100 μl of cells at a concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 100 μl of mouse serum diluted 1:5 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were pelleted by microfugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed. Fluid phase C3 was removed by repeated washing of the cells with ice-cold PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. The cell pellet was resuspended in a final volume of 200 μl, and 50 μl were added of a 20 μg/ml suspension of a 125I-radiolabeled rat IgG2a monoclonal antibody against murine C3 (Connex, Martinsreid, Germany). The anti-C3 monoclonal antibody was radiolabeled by the direct IODO-GEN method (28Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 18.5 MBq/mg. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with frequent agitation, two 75-μl aliquots of the cell suspension were removed and spun through 150 μl of di-“isononyl” phthalate oil (Fluka Chemicals, Gillingham, UK) at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. The tubes were cut, and the radioactivity of the cell pellet was used to determine the number of molecules of anti-C3 monoclonal present as a measure of C3 molecules bound per erythrocyte. Serum treated with EDTA to a concentration of 50 mm was used as a negative control, and serum treated with PBS, 0.007 m Mg2+, 0.01 m EGTA was used as a control for AP activity. Heat-aggregated murine IgG (HAGG) was used as a model immune complex. HAGG was prepared by incubation of total murine IgG (Sigma-Aldrich), at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, at 56 °C for 30 min, and insoluble complexes were removed by centrifugation at 1,100 × g for 10 min. The HAGG was then radiolabeled by the direct IODO-GEN method (28Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 37 MBq/mg.H2-Bf-deficient animals and their wild type and heterozygous littermates were injected intravenously with 1 μg of125I-labeled HAGG (equivalent to 37 kBq of radioactivity). HAGG was injected with an equal volume of a 10% suspension of51Cr-labeled mouse erythrocytes as a blood pool tracer to control for injection quality. The mouse red blood cells were labeled by incubating 4 ml of a 10% suspension in PBS with 7.4 MBq of51Cr for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed several times with PBS after labeling to remove unbound radioactivity. Two hours after the injection the mice were killed, a 50-μl blood sample was taken, and the spleen and liver were removed and weighed.125I and 51Cr radioactivity was determined using a γ-scintillation counter and corrected for emission window overlap. The unbound radioactivity present in the intravascular compartment of the spleen was determined from the published murine splenic blood volume of 180 μl/g (29Altman P.L. Dittmer D.S. Blood and Other Bodily Fluids. Biological Handbooks, Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, Bethesda, MD1961: 9Google Scholar), and the 125I-HAGG was measured in a unit blood volume. Immune complex uptake was defined as: (125I cpm of the whole organ − 125I cpm in blood pool of the organ)/organ mass. Analysis of the51Cr radioactivity in the blood sample confirmed consistency in injection quality. All methods used to calculate the organ distribution of the HAGG, including percentage of injected HAGG in the organ, counts/min/g of organ mass and counts/min of the whole organ gave consistent results, whether corrections were made for blood pooling effects or not. The murine H2-Bf gene was disrupted in ES cells by homologous recombination with the targeting vector pH2-Bf.lacZ/neo-HSVtk. A targeting frequency of approximately 1 in 16 of the double selection resistant ES cell clones was achieved at the H2-Bf locus. Five of the recombinant clones were chosen, determined to have a euploid karyotype, and microinjected into 3.5-day postcoitus blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice. Four of the five clones generated chimeras that transmitted the disrupted allele through the germline. Four independent lines ofH2-Bf-deficient animals (Bf-16, Bf-40,Bf-79, and Bf-114) were established in both the mixed (129/Sv × C57BL/6) and pure (129/Sv) genetic backgrounds.H2-Bf-deficient mice had neither detectable factor B mRNA by Northern blot (Fig. 2), using a cDNA probe that encodes the Ba activation fragment, nor protein in their serum by radial-immunodiffusion using a cross-reacting rabbit anti-human factor B polyclonal antisera (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK).H2-Bf-deficient animals showed no specific functional factor B activity in the cobra venom factor-dependent assay (data not shown) and no detectable alternative pathway activity as demonstrated by their failure to lyse guinea pig erythrocytes (data not shown). The mice were fully viable under specific pathogen-free conditions, and the disrupted allele was inherited in accordance with normal Mendelian inheritance patterns (the genotypes of 296 offspring from F1 heterozygous crosses were 77 H2-Bf−/− (26%), 146 H2-Bf+/− (49.3%), and 73 H2-Bf+/+ (24.7%)). Northern blot analysis of the neighboring gene for complement component C2 failed to detect C2 mRNA in liver RNA ofH2-Bf-deficient mice (Fig. 2), while the transcript was visible in the wild type mice. Overexposure of the same film showed a very weak signal of the correct size in the gene-targeted mice (data not shown). To better quantify theC2 mRNA present, a semiquantitative RT-PCR was used.C2 cDNA was amplified at the same time as cDNA for the C1qA gene using 20, 25, and 30 cycles. C2product was not detectable after 20 amplification cycles in the deficient mice, whereas it was already visible in the wild type littermates (Fig. 3). After 25 cycles, the message was detected in the deficient mice, but the product was much more abundant in the wild type mice. Amplification of theC1qA gene was equivalent at all steps between all mice. This RT-PCR observation is consistent with the presence of C2mRNA, albeit at greatly reduced levels. The 5′-untranslated region of the H2-Bf gene was amplified in the same way, since this region of the mRNA should be retained in the deficient mice where only the H2-Bf coding sequence was replaced by thelacZ reporter gene. The results obtained by RT-PCR were very similar to those for C2 (Fig. 3). The 5′-untranslated region was not visible after 20 cycles of amplification in the deficient animals, whereas it could be seen in the wild type mice. After 25 cycles, the product was detectable from the deficient mice but again at much reduced levels compared with the wild type. Amplification of theC1qA cDNA was equal between deficient and sufficient mice. This latter observation suggests that the reporter gene was expressed at much lower levels than the wild type H2-Bfgene. This observation could not be confirmed by direct comparison on Northern blot as the 5′-untranslated region of H2-Bf did not work successfully as a probe. A similar pattern of gene expression was observed for the downstream neighbor gene of H2-Bf,D17H6S45 (Fig. 3). Expression of the gene for complement component C4 (C4) was checked to determine if the effect of the gene targeting was localized to these three genes or if it had spread further, since C4 is approximately 40 kb downstream of H2-Bf. The expression of C4 was found to be similar in H2-Bf-deficient and -sufficient mice (Fig. 3), suggesting that the effects of the gene-targeting event were localized. In the absence of an antigenic assay for mouse C2 we assessed the classical pathway-mediated total hemolytic complement activity in the serum. The percentage of total lysis (±S.E.) caused by serum fromH2-Bf+/+ (n = 5) and H2-Bf+/− (n = 5) mice was 49.3% (±8.13%) and 45.8% (±10.24%), respectively. The H2-Bf−/− (n= 5) mice were unable to lyse antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (0.85 ± 0.37%). As a further test of the classical pathway activity, we measured the ability of the serum from the deficient animals to opsonize antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes with C3 and found that this was also absent (Fig. 4) and no different to the opsonizing capabilities of serum from C1q-deficient mice, which are specifically deficient of the classical pathway of complement activation. Serum from normal mice was able to bind nearly 1700 molecules of C3 per erythrocyte. The alternative pathway alone was unable to opsonize the antibody-sensitized erythrocytes, demonstrating the specific requirement for the classical pathway. To further confirm the total absence of classical pathway activity in these mice, we decided to evaluate immune complex processing in vivo. Immune complex processing has previously been shown to be abnormal in humans with classical pathway deficiency (21Davies K.A. Erlendsson K. Beynon H.L.C. Peters A.M. Steinsson K. Valdimarsson H. Walport M.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3866-3873PubMed Google Scholar) and also in C1q-deficient mice (22Botto M. Nash J. Taylor P. Bygrave A. Pandolfi P.P. Loos M. Davies K.A. Walport M.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33 (abstr.): 71PubMed Google Scholar). Splenic uptake of radiolabeled heat-aggregated murine IgG was severely impaired in theH2-Bf-deficient mice (Fig.5 A). The difference in splenic uptake was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Two hours postinjection the median splenic uptake of HAGG was 23,180 cpm/g (range 12,380–30,350) in 10 gene-targeted mice, compared with 42,040 cpm/g (range 31,940–103,300) in 13 control mice (U = 0,p < 0.0001). Hepatic uptake in theH2-Bf-deficient mice was no different from the controls (Fig. 5 B). The median hepatic uptake in the 10H2-Bf-deficient mice was 35,460 cpm/g (range 20,510–49,390), compared with 27,680 cpm/g (range 10,450–64,320) in the 13 control mice (U = 53, p < 0.48). The organ distribution of the aggregated IgG was no different form that observed in C1q-deficient mice (data not shown). Splenic uptake of monomeric murine IgG was approximately 40% of the uptake of HAGG in the complement-deficient animals (data not shown), implying that very little splenic uptake of aggregates was occurring in the deficient animals. These results suggest an effective total failure of classical pathway activity in vivo.Figure 5Immune complex processing inH2-Bf- deficient mice. A, graph shows the counts/min/g of 125I-HAGG present in the spleen ofH2-Bf−/− mice and their H2-Bf+/+ litter mates 2 h postinjection.

Horizontal bars denote the medians of both groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here we report a characterized total deficiency of complement component factor B. Mice were generated by homologous recombination in ES cells that carried a disrupted H2-Bf allele with the entire coding region of the wild type gene replaced with a promoterlesslacZ reporter gene cloned into the same reading frame as the first codons of H2-Bf. Downstream of the lacZgene was the positively selectable marker gene for neomycin resistance. Four independent ES cell clones generated lines of mice carrying the disrupted gene. Homozygous H2-Bf-deficient animals had no detectable levels of factor B in their serum by radial immunodiffusion and had no specific functional factor B activity in a cobra venom factor-dependent assay. H2-Bf-deficient animals had no AP activity demonstrated by their failure to lyse guinea pig erythrocytes. The mice were fully viable under specific pathogen-free conditions. In all four different lines of H2-Bf-deficient mice, transmission of the targeted allele was in accordance with normal Mendelian inheritance. This observation is not entirely in agreement with that of Matsumoto et al. (30Matsumoto M. Fukuda W. Circolo A. Goellner J. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Wang X. Fujita S. Hidvegi T. Chaplin D.D. Colten H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8720-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), who have recently generated H2-Bf-deficient mice and found a selective disadvantage for the inheritance of their disrupted factor B allele in only one of their two mouse lines. This abnormal inheritance pattern may have been due to chance. Surprisingly, the mutation introduced into the H2-Bf gene caused a dramatic down-regulation in the expression of the neighboring gene for complement component C2 of the classical pathway. The regulatory elements of C2 expression reported in the literature are 5′ of C2, away from the site of the deletion (31Sullivan K.E. Wu L.C. Campbell R.D. Valle D. Winkelstein J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and at the 3′ end of the gene in the intragenic region betweenH2-Bf and C2 (32Moreira A. Wollerton M. Monks J. Proudfoot N.J.

https://openalex.org/W1988842403,"Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway of many protozoan parasites. The predicted amino acid sequences of certain HGPRT proteins from parasites of the Trypanosomatidae family reveal a COOH-terminal tripeptide signal that is consistent with the degenerate topogenic signal targeting proteins to the glycosome, a fuel-metabolizing microbody unique to these parasites. To determine definitively the intracellular milieu of HGPRT in these pathogens, polyclonal antiserum to the purified recombinant HGPRT from Leishmania donovani was generated in rabbits, and confocal and immunoelectron microscopy were employed to establish that the L. donovani HGPRT is localized exclusively to the glycosome. No HGPRT protein was detected in Δhgprt null mutants in which both alleles of the HGPRT locus had been replaced by a drug-resistance cassette. Transfectants of theΔhgprt knockout strain in which a wild-typeHGPRT was amplified on an expression plasmid contained augmented amounts of HGPRT, all of which was localized to the glycosome. Δhgprt transfectants containing amplified copies of a mutated HGPRT construct in which the Ser-Lys-Val COOH-terminal targeting signal had been deleted expressed HGPRT throughout the parasite, including subcellular organelles such as the nucleus and flagellum. These data demonstrate that the L. donovani HGPRT is compartmentalized exclusively within the glycosome and that the COOH-terminal tripeptide of the protein is necessary to achieve targeting to this organelle.

The genus Leishmania, a member of the Trypanosomatidae family, is the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease of considerable import in terms of both mortality and morbidity. AllLeishmania sp. are digenetic, existing as extracellular, flagellated promastigotes within their sandfly vectors and as intracellular, nonmotile amastigotes within the phagolysosomes of macrophages and other reticuloendothelial cells of the vertebrate host. The drugs used in the treatment of leishmaniasis and other parasitic diseases have been realized empirically and are far from ideal. Toxicity is common, the drugs are potentially mutagenic and/or carcinogenic, regimens are prolonged and usually require multiple drug administrations, drug resistance or refractoriness persists as a significant therapeutic obstacle, and the prospects for effective antiparasitic vaccines in the immediate future are bleak (1Campbell W.C. Rew R.S. Chemotherapy of Parasitic Diseases. Plenum Press, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The rational development of new antiparasitic drugs that are selective for the metabolic machinery of the parasite will require therapeutic exploitation of fundamental biochemical differences between the parasite and vertebrate host. Perhaps the most striking metabolic discrepancy between parasites and their human hosts is the pathways by which they synthesize purine nucleotides. Whereas mammalian cells synthesize purine nucleotides from amino acids and one-carbon moieties, all protozoan parasites evaluated to date are incapable of purine nucleotide synthesis de novo (2Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press Limited, London1995Google Scholar). Thus, these pathogens are auxotrophic for purines and consequently express purine salvage enzymes that enable them to access host purines. Metabolic, biochemical, and genetic studies have revealed thatLeishmania donovani promastigotes funnel a variety of exogenous purines into hypoxanthine (3Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Nelson D.J. Biochim.

However, the viability and normal growth rate of Δhgprt null mutants of L. donovani that have been created by targeted gene replacement have clearly demonstrated that HGPRT does not play an indispensable role in purine salvage by the promastigote form of the parasite (5Hwang H.-Y.

Indeed, HPP has demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in patients with either cutaneous leishmaniasis (10Martinez S. Marr J.J. N. Engl. J.

Coombs G.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 81B: 1037-1040Google Scholar), Trypanosoma brucei (13Hammond D.J. Aman R.A. Wang C.C. J. Biol.

Lett. 1982; 13: 207-212Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) are localized to the glycosome, a fuel metabolizing microbody that is unique to parasites of the Trypanosomatidae family (15Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 16Opperdoes F.R. Michels P. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A glycosomal milieu for HGPRT in the Trypanosomatidae is supported by the fact that the COOH-terminal tripeptides of the HGPRTs from L. donovani(17Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), T. cruzi (18Allen T.E. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and Crithidia fasciculata(19Jiang Y. Allen T.E. Carter D. Ray D.S. Ullman B Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) are consistent with the acceptable degeneracy for the well characterized COOH-terminal targeting signal for glycosomal localization (20Blattner J.

Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As definitive information on the subcellular location of therapeutically pertinent enzymes is critical for drug targeting, we have established by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy that the HGPRT protein from L. donovani, unlike the mammalian HGPRT, is localized exclusively to the glycosome. Furthermore, we have demonstrated genetically that the COOH-terminal tripeptide is required for this glycosomal compartmentation, asΔhgprt mutants transfected with an hgprtconstruct truncated at the COOH terminus express HGPRT protein throughout the parasite. L. donovani promastigotes were grown at room temperature in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Leishmania medium with xanthine as the purine source (22Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells employed in the biochemical or immunolocalization experiments were routinely harvested in exponential growth at a density of ∼5–6 × 106 cells/ml. The wild-type DI700 strain originates from the 1S Sudanese clone of L. donovani and is designated DI700:H+/+ for the purposes of the genetic manipulations described in these studies, where H denotes theHGPRT locus and + specifies the wild-type allele. Mutant parasites containing functional copies of the neomycin or hygromycin phosphotransferase genes were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Leishmania medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml Geneticin® (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 400 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively. The L. donovani HGPRT and flanking regions were isolated as described (5Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Vectors pX63-HYGand pSNBR (containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene) have been described (23Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 24Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. Stephen M. Beverley of Washington University. The construction of the Δhgprt null mutant, DI700:H n/n has also been described previously (5Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), where the n superscript designates an allele in which the neomycin phosphotransferase marker has been inserted into theHGPRT locus. The DI700:H n/n strain was generated by replacing the first wild-type HGPRT allele with a targeting construct encompassing the neomycin phosphotransferase marker followed by negative selection for loss of heterozygosity to generate theΔhgprt knockout (5Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The DI700:H n/n strain was employed as a recipient for transfection of functional episomalHGPRT constructs. To create HGPRT overexpressors, wild-type and mutantHGPRT constructs were inserted into leishmanial expression vectors and amplified by selection in hygromycin. The wild-typeHGPRT was amplified from the 3.5-kilobase EcoRIHGPRT fragment initially described by Allen et al. (17Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a Coy Instruments (Ann Arbor, MI) thermocycler. Standard conditions for amplification of plasmid DNA were employed: 15 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 0.5 min. The sense primer, 5′-TCCCCCGGGATGAGCAACTCGGCCAAG-3′, was constructed to the first 18 nucleotides of the HGPRT protein coding region and was preceded by a 9-nucleotide leader encompassing anXmaI restriction site (underlined). The antisense primer, 5′-GAAGATCTTATAGCTCGTCACCGCTA-3′, was synthesized to the 18 nucleotides immediately downstream from theHGPRT protein coding region including the stop codon (bold lettering) and contained an 8-nucleotide leader with aBglII restriction site (underlined). The 668-bp PCR product was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into theXmaI-BglII sites of the leishmanial pX63-HYG vector (23Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A mutant HGPRT lacking the three COOH-terminal amino acids was also amplified from the same template using identical PCR conditions and sense primer. The antisense primer, 5′-GGATCTAGA CTACTCCGGCTTCTCGTAGTACTC-3′, was constructed to amino acids 202–208 of the wild-type HGPRT and was preceded with a 12-nucleotide leader containing anXbaI restriction site (underlined) and an in-frame stop codon (bold). After cleavage with XmaI and XbaI, the 645-bp PCR fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites of the pSNBR-HYG vector. pSNBR-HYG was generated by replacing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NEO) from pSNBR-NEO with the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HYG) from pX63-HYG as follows. The 3,468-bpKpnI-HindIII fragment encompassing NEOwas inserted into a modified pBluescript plasmid in which theSpeI and SacI sites had been destroyed. TheNEO marker was then replaced with HYG by ligating the 1,843-bp SpeI-SacI fragment of pX63-HYG into the resulting vector from which theNEO marker had been excised with SpeI andSacI. Finally, the KpnI-HindIII fragment encompassing HYG was ligated to the 2,927-bpKpnI-HindIII fragment from pSNBR that contained the prokaryotic origin of replication and the ampicillin resistance gene. The wild-type and COOH-terminal deletion mutant HGPRTconstructs were designated pX63-HYG-HGPRT and pSNBR-HYG-hgprtΔ(209–211), respectively. The COOH-terminal deletion within the pSNBR-HYG-hgprtΔ(209–211) construct was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using the Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). pX63-HYG-HGPRT and pSNBR-HYG-hgprtΔ(209–211) were transfected into the DI700:H n/n Δhgprt parasites using standard electroporation conditions for Leishmania parasites (5Hwang H.-Y.

DI700:H n/n cells transfected with pX63-HYG-HGPRT and pSNBR-HYG-hgprtΔ(209–211) were designated DI700:H n/n [pX63-HYG-HGPRT] and DI700:H n/n [pSNBR-HYG-hgprt(Δ209–211)], respectively. For the purposes of figure representation, DI700:H n/n [pX63-HYG-HGPRT] and DI700:H n/n [pSNBR-HYG-hgprt(Δ209–211)] were labeled W2 and ΔSKV, respectively. The construction of the wild-type HGPRT pBAce expression vector (17Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the wild-type HGPRT-pSelect mutagenesis expression vector (24Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported. To generate anHGPRT expression vector in which the COOH-terminal tripeptide was deleted, the HGPRT within pSelect (Promega, Madison, WI) was altered by introduction of three stop codons (boldface in primer below) at positions 209–211 of the protein. The mutagenic primer was 5′-CTCAAGAAGGAGTACTACGAGAAGCCGGAGTGATAGTAGTAGCGGTGACGAGCTATACTCGAG-3′ and contained a PstI site (underlined) at the 3′ end. The mutated NdeI-PstI HGPRT fragment from pSelect was then ligated into the appropriate sites in pBAce and transformed into Sφ606 (Δpro-gpt-lac, thi, hpt) E. coli, a strain lacking the bacterial hypoxanthine and xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes (26Craig III, S.P.

The COOH-terminal truncation was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Recombinant wild-type and mutant HGPRT were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography as reported (17Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Allen T. Henschel E.V. Coons T. Cross L. Conley J. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activity of recombinant enzyme was assayed spectrophotometrically as described (25Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HGPRT activity in sonicated extracts of exponentially growing parasites (∼1.0 × 107 parasites/ml) that had been extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was assessed by a previously described radiometric protocol (27Allen T. Henschel E.V. Coons T. Cross L. Conley J. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum to recombinant HGPRT was generated as described (5Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The antisera was purified by chromatography over a protein A-Sepharose column (Sigma) according to the brochure of the supplier. Rabbit antiserum raised to the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein of L. mexicana were generously provided by Dr. P. Michels and F. Opperdoes of the International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology in Brussels, Belgium. Wild-type, mutant, and transfectant parasites were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, resuspended in sample buffer, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Lysates from 105 cells in a volume of 20 μl were fractionated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60-18.75Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filters were incubated with anti-HGPRT antisera at a 1:10,000 dilution using a blocking solution of 5% milk, and the blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim). Exponentially growingL. donovani at concentrations ∼5–6 × 106 cells/ml were harvested by centrifugation, washed several times in PBS, incubated for 30 min in fixative consisting of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and attached to coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. Cells were then permeabilized for 30 min at ambient temperature in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum. Anti-HGPRT antibody at a dilution of 1:200 was added to the permeabilized cells and incubated either for 4 h at 25 °C or for 16 h at 4 °C. Coverslips were rinsed six times with PBS, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red fluorophore (Molecular Bioprobes, Eugene, OR) at a 1:500 dilution, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the absence of light. After six more washes in PBS, a fluorescein lipophilic dye, 3,3′-diohexyloxocarbocyanine iodide (Molecular Bioprobes), was added to a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the coverslips were washed immediately with PBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 90% glycerol, and 20 mg/mln-propylgallate and examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope as described (31Piper R.C. Xu X. Russell D.G. Little B.M. Landfear S.M J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 128: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and fixed either with 8% paraformaldehyde in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, or as described above for the immunofluorescence microscopy. After fixation, cells were washed three times with 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, then infused with polyvinylpyrrolidone and sucrose (32Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) for ultrathin cryosectioning. Double labeling using two different sizes of gold probes (Amersham Corp.) was performed as described (33Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 113: 122-135Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar). 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS was used for the blocking step between antibodies. Control incubations included labeling cryosections with either 1) anti-HGPRT antibodies competed with purified recombinant HGPRT, 2) no primary antibodies, or 3) irrelevant antibodies. Immunolabeled sections were embedded in 25 centipoise methyl cellulose and uranyl acetate (34Griffiths G. McDowell A. Back R. Dubochet J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1984; 89: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and viewed with a Philips 301 transmission electron microscope (Philips Electronics, Mahwah, NJ). To determine the location of the HGPRT in L. donovani, antibodies directed against epitopes on the enzyme were generated in rabbits. These antibodies recognized only a single protein in wild-type parasite lysates that migrated with a molecular mass approximate to that predicted from the translatedHGPRT protein coding region (Fig.1). This band was established to be HGPRT genetically as this antiserum did not recognize any protein in lysates of the Δhgprt DI700:H n/n strain (Fig. 1). The location of the HGPRT enzyme in wild type L. donovani was initially assessed by confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence analysis of HGPRT stained with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody revealed a punctate pattern in DI700:H+/+ cells not observed with DI700:H n/n parasites (Fig. 2,A and B, respectively). Immunoelectron microscopy was used to confirm glycosomal targeting of the enzyme (Fig.3). Gold particle labeling for HGPRT was sequestered within the glycosomes in wild-type parasites, and no other subcellular compartments were labeled to a significant degree (Fig. 3,A and B). This localization pattern paralleled that obtained with antibodies to L. mexicana GAPDH (Fig.3 C), a glycolytic enzyme whose glycosomal location inL. donovani has been documented (35Hart D.T. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Hannaert V. Callens M. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, theL. donovani HGPRT colocalized with the GAPDH (Fig.3 D). No immunogold labeling was observed for either DI700:H+/+ cells incubated with excess recombinant HGPRT (Fig. 3 E) or for DI700:H n/n parasites (Fig.4, A and B). These data demonstrate clearly that the L. donovani HGPRT is compartmentalized to the glycosome.Figure 3Transmission electron micrographs of ultrathin cryosections of wild-type L. donovaniimmunolabeled with anti-HGPRT and anti-GAPDH antibodies.Wild-type DI700:H+/+ L. donovani were fixed in either 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde (A) or 8% paraformaldehyde (B) and immunolabeled with anti-HGPRT antisera followed by goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to gold (10-nm probe). As a control, parasites fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde were immunolabeled with anti-GAPDH antibodies followed by immunogold probe (C). DI700:H+/+ cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde were double-labeled with anti-HGPRT (5-nm gold particles indicated with arrowheads) and with anti-GAPDH (10-nm gold particles) as indicated in panel D. Inset within panel D shows a glycosome from a second parasite double labeled in an identical fashion.

Both the DI700:H n/n [pX63-HYG-HGPRT] and DI700:H n/n [pSNBR-HYG-hgprt(Δ209–211)] transfectants expressed ∼10–15-fold greater quantities of HGPRT activity (Fig. 5) and protein (Fig. 1) than DI700:H+/+ parasites (Fig. 5). Deletion of the Ser-Lys-Val tripeptide did not appear to grossly alter the catalytic properties of the enzyme. Apparent K m andk cat values calculated for the mutant enzyme by Hanes analysis were 4.8 μm and 6.2 s−1 for hypoxanthine and 11.6 μm and 15.8 s−1 for guanine. These values are comparable with the K m andk cat values of 6.4 μm and 5.7 s−1 for hypoxanthine and 9.9 μm and 12.1 s−1 for guanine that were reported previously for the wild-type L. donovani HGPRT (17Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of DI700:H n/n [pX63-HYG-HGPRT] cells revealed amplified HGPRT signal in a punctate pattern, whereas HGPRT appeared to be dispersed in the DI700:H n/n [pSNBR-HYG-hgprt(Δ209–211)] parasite transfectants (Fig. 2, C and D). The role of the Ser-Lys-Val tripeptide in glycosome targeting was then established by immunoelectron microscopy. Whereas labeling with immunogold was restricted to the glycosomes in DI700:H n/n [pX63-HYG-HGPRT] transfectants, immunogold particles were ubiquitously distributed throughout DI700:H n/n [pSNBR-HYG-hgprt(Δ209–211)] parasites (Fig. 4, C-F). To ensure that the disseminated distribution of HGPRT in DI700:H n/n [pSNBR-HYG-hgprt(Δ209–211)] cells could not be attributed to glycosome loss or leakage, the location of GAPDH was ascertained in all cell lines by immunofluorescence. Confocal immunfluorescence with antibodies directed against the glycolytic enzyme revealed similar punctate patterns of staining in DI700:H+/+, DI700:H n/n, DI700:H n/n [pX63-HYG-HGPRT], and DI700:H n/n [pSNBR-HYG-hgprt(Δ209–211)] cells (Fig. 6, A-D). The HGPRT enzyme of L. donovani has been definitively localized to the parasite glycosome by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Specificity of antibodies directed against HGPRT epitopes used for the immunocytochemistry was established by 1) immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, 2) the ability of excess purified recombinant enzyme to block immunogold labeling of the parasites, and 3) the failure of the anti-HGPRT antisera to recognize any protein inΔhgprt parasites. A glycosomal milieu for this central enzyme in purine salvage in trypanosomatids was initially conjectured on the basis of crude subcellular fractionation experiments in which HGPRT activity was largely associated with the glycosomal fraction ofL. mexicana (12Hassan H.F. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 81B: 1037-1040Google Scholar), T. brucei (13Hammond D.J. Aman R.A. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and T. cruzi (14Gutteridge W.E. Davies M.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 13: 207-212Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, trypanosomatid HGPRT coding sequences predicted COOH-terminal tripeptides compatible with the well established COOH-terminal signal that is recognized by the glycosome import machinery (20Blattner J. Swinkels B. Dorsam H. Prospero T. Subramani S. Clayton C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.-L. Keller G.-A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Of these three amino acids, the first is usually a small uncharged amino acid, the second an amino acid containing a hydrogen bond-forming group, and the third is hydrophobic in nature (20Blattner J.

Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), Ser-Lys-Tyr (18Allen T.E. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1996; 82: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), respectively, and are all within the acceptable degeneracy for this targeting signal. TheT. brucei HGPRT ends with an Ala-Lys-Arg (37Allen T.E. Ullman B. Nucl. Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5431-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and would not be predicted from mutational studies of targeting signals on firefly luciferase (21Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.-L. Keller G.-A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase-phosphoglycerate kinase hybrids (20Blattner J. Swinkels B. Dorsam H. Prospero T. Subramani S. Clayton C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to be a glycosomal import signal. Mutational analysis has established that the Ser-Lys-Val of theL. donovani HGPRT protein is required for glycosome compartmentalization. Transfection of the pSNBR-HYG-hgprtΔ(209–211) construct in which these three amino acids have been deleted into a Δhgprt background results in a ubiquitous distribution of the protein throughout the parasite, including the nucleus, flagellum, and plasma membrane, as well as glycosomes. This mislocalization of mutated protein cannot be attributed to plasmid expression of HGPRT, as a wild-type episomal construct directed the expression of correctly targeted protein, or to major structural abnormalities, as the hgprt(Δ209–211) protein was kinetically comparable with the wild-type enzyme. Although, the COOH-terminal tripeptide is necessary for glycosome compartmentation, and whether it contains all the necessary information for targeting HGPRT to the glycosome is unknown. However, Ser-Lys-Val addition to the COOH terminus does mediate glycosome entry of firefly luciferase in T. brucei (21Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.-L. Keller G.-A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reason for the glycosomal compartmentalization of HGPRT in L. donovani and related parasites remains unclear, as the enzyme is cytosolic in mammalian cell systems. However, glycosomes accommodate a variety of fuel metabolizing enzymes that perform essential nutritional functions for the parasite (15Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 16Opperdoes F.R. Michels P. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the auxotrophy of these parasites for purines (2Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press Limited, London1995Google Scholar) dictates that purine salvage is nutritionally essential for these organisms. Therefore, the perspective that glycosomes are fuel metabolizing organelles can perhaps be expanded to include other nutritional pathways. The location of other purine salvage and interconversion enzymes in trypanosomatids has not been conclusively determined. Fractionation of L. mexicanaextracts by isopycnic centrifugation indicated that the purine salvage enzymes, IMP dehydrogenase, the enzyme that converts the IMP product of HGPRT to XMP, and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, cosedimented with glycosome and particulate fractions, respectively, whereas adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, nucleosidases, and adenine deaminase were all cytosolic (38Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 59: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the COOH-terminal tripeptides of IMP dehydrogenase (39Wilson K. Collart F. Huberman E. Stringer J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1665-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Ala-Lys-Leu, data not reported) from L. donovani are both plausible glycosomal import signals. The comparable sequence on adenine phosphoribosylransferase, His-Pro-His, is an unlikely candidate to mediate glysosome entry (40Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One credible hypothesis for the glycosomal compartmentation of HGPRT is to provide optimal access to substrate. However, purine bases must obligatorily be acquired from the extracellular environment, whereas PRPP substrate is generated from ribose-5-phosphate and ATP by the catalytic action of PRPP synthetase. Although the location of the parasite PRPP synthetase is not known, the enzyme terminates in an Arg-Asp-Ser sequence, a dubious targeting signal for glycosome entry. Despite the lack of a clear rationale for the atypical organellar compartmentalization of HGPRT in trypanosomatids, the categorical association of this therapeutically germane purine salvage enzyme to the glycosome is significant not only from a biological perspective but also from a drug development standpoint, as drugs that target HGPRT may need to traverse intracellular membranes to exert their antiparasitic effects.

GzmB has been difficult to study and has not yet been produced in non-mammalian systems because of the complex processing events that are thought to be required for its activation. In this report, we have successfully produced fully active, soluble recombinant GzmB (rGzmB) in a yeast-based system by fusing GzmB cDNA in frame with yeast α-factor cDNA, using the yeast KEX2 signal peptidase to release the processed enzyme into the supernatant of yeast cultures. We expressed the proenzyme form of GzmB as well and determined that pro-GzmB is efficiently converted to its active form by the cysteine proteinase dipeptidyl peptidase I.

In addition, the recombinant enzyme hydrolyzes Boc-Ala-Ala-Met thiobenzyl ester with a k cat of 3.2 s−1 and a catalytic efficiencyk cat/K m of 65,306m−1 s−1. Purified rGzmB can also cleave the putative substrate caspase-3 into its signature p20/p10 forms.

The importance of GzmB for inducing target cell death has been demonstrated via several lines of evidence (reviewed in Refs. 1Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 343-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and 2Pham C.T.N. Ley T.J. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and confirmed with GzmB null mutant mice (3Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). CTL and NK cells derived from these mice have a severe defect in their ability to induce early DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in susceptible target cells. Furthermore, in vivo data suggest that GzmB plays a significant role in the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (4Graubert T.A. Russell J.H. Ley T.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Graubert T.A. DiPersio J.F. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, a specific inhibitor of GzmB may potentially prove to be an important tool in the modulation of immune responses. Among all the known granzymes, human and murine GzmB possess an unusual preference for aspartic acid at the P1 site of its substrates (6Odake S. Kam C.-M. Narasimhan L. Poe M. Blake J.T. Krahenbuhl O. Tschopp J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This specificity is shared by only one other group of eukaryotic proteases, the caspases (reviewed in Ref. 7Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Experiments with cell-free systems and caspase inhibitors have strongly implicated these enzymes in apoptotic cell death (reviewed in Refs. 8Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 9Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4526) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized as proenzymes that generally require processing at aspartic acid residues for activation. Although the enzymes responsible for the activation of these caspases are unknown, there is evidence that these enzymes can autoactivate or cross-activate other family members (10Thornberry N.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3517-3522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also shown that GzmB can cleave and activate caspase-3 (CPP32) (14Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), caspase-8 (FLICE) (15Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J.

Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar), and other caspases; in addition, GzmB-deficient CTL fail to cleave caspase-3 in target cells during CTL-induced apoptosis (16Darmon A.J. Ley T.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21709-21712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, these data have not determined whether GzmB induces apoptosis through the activation of caspases or whether it acts directly to induce apoptosis. Several studies have shown that peptide-based, selective caspase inhibitors (which do not inhibit GzmB) can block apoptotic cell death and target cell lysis induced by the Fas-FasL pathway, but not the CTL granule exocytosis (perforin/granzyme-dependent) pathway (17Sarin A. Wu M.-L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Sarin A. Williams M.S. Alexander-Miller M.A. Berzofsky J.A. Zacharchuk C.M. Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). GzmB is the prototype of a family of serine proteases (A–K) that are synthesized as preproenzymes with an 18-residue leader peptide (23 residues for granzyme A) (reviewed in Ref. 19Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Immunol. Rev. 1988; 103: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These leader peptides are thought to be cleaved by a signal peptidase, leaving a prodipeptide that must be removed to produce the active enzyme (20Caputo A. Garner R.S. Winkler U. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17672-17675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme thought to be responsible for the specific cleavage of the prodipeptide is the lysosomal cysteine protease DPPI (21McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kummer J.A. Kamp A.M. Citarella F. Horrevoets A.J.G. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9281-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous studies in COS cells have shown that co-transfection of a full-length (prepro) human GzmB cDNA along with a rat DPPI cDNA resulted in the generation of an enzymatically active GzmB, whereas transfection of full-length GzmB cDNA alone led to the production of a catalytically inactive enzyme (22Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant granzyme A (rGzmA) can be converted into a proteolytically active enzyme by incubation with bovine DPPI (23Kummer J.A. Kamp A.M. Citarella F. Horrevoets A.J.G. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9281-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although native GzmB (nGzmB) has been purified, only limited amounts of relatively pure enzyme have been obtained. Previously, small amounts of rGzmB have been successfully prepared from a mammalian COS cell-based system (22Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar, 24Caputo A. James M.N.G. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the inability to purify sufficient amounts of rGzmB (without any other contaminating cellular enzymes) has limited the ability to study substrate specificities and to design specific inhibitors. rGzmA has been successfully expressed inEscherichia coli (25Beresford P.J. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and vaccinia virus (23Kummer J.A. Kamp A.M. Citarella F. Horrevoets A.J.G. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9281-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, we have repeatedly failed to generate soluble active rGzmB using a variety of expression systems. In this study, we describe the production of a yeast-based, soluble, secreted form of active rGzmB. This recombinant protein has the same specificities as nGzmB purified from an NK tumor cell line. We showed that pro-GzmB (which contains the prodipeptide Gly-Glu) can be converted to a fully active form by bovine DPPI. The active mature rGzmB can cleave caspase-3 into its signature p20/p10 forms. We also determined that several peptide-based caspase inhibitors do not significantly inhibit the Asp'ase activity of rGzmB; furthermore, Zn2+, a potent inhibitor of caspase-3 (26Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18530-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), fails to inhibit rGzmB. These results underscore the fundamental differences in substrate specificities between the caspases and GzmB. The cDNAs encoding the pro and mature forms of murine GzmB were amplified using the forward primers 5′-GGGGAGATCATCGGGGGGAC-3′ (pro) and 5′-ATCATCGGGGGACATGAAGC-3′ (mature) and the reverse primer 5′-TTAGCTTTTCATTGTTTTCTTTATCCAGGATAAGAAACTTGAGAC-3′. A 5′XhoI site and a 3′ EcoRI site were introduced into the cDNAs and the products subcloned into the expression vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Both inserts were completely sequenced and found to be identical (except for the prodipeptide Gly-Glu). Both vectors were electroporated into GS115 (Invitrogen) at 1.5 KV, 50 μF, and 186 ohms. His+ transformants were selected and induced with methanol for 4 days according to a protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Daily aliquots of induced supernatants from His+ clones were assayed for Asp'ase activity and probed (using Western blotting) for the presence of rGzmB using a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse GzmB antibody (27Shresta S. McIvor D.M. Heusel J.H. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The clones expressing pro-GzmB and mature rGzmB were selected and further expanded. A liter of supernatant from each clone was precipitated using 85% ammonium sulfate, resuspended, and dialyzed to a final concentration of 250 mm NaCl in 50 mm MES, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% betaine (MEB buffer). The concentrated supernatant was loaded onto a Mono S cation exchange column, and proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.25 m NaCl to 1 m NaCl. Pro-GzmB and rGzmB both eluted at approximately 0.6 m NaCl. Murine GzmB was isolated from an NK-like tumor line derived from tumors that arose in transgenic mice expressing SV40 large T-antigen driven by the human granzyme H 5′-flanking promoter sequence. 2D. MacIvor and T. J. Ley, submitted for publication. This cell line was used because it expresses abundant murine GzmB (28Pham C.T.N. MacIvor D.M. Hug B.A. Heusel J.W. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93 (1996): 13090-13095Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, pelleted, resuspended in 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and sonicated. The crude extract was cleared by centrifugation, dialyzed to a final concentration of 250 mmNaCl in MEB buffer, and loaded onto a Mono S column. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25 to 1 m NaCl. Native murine GzmB eluted at approximately 0.6 m NaCl. Western analysis was performed using the polyclonal rabbit anti-murine GzmB antibody as described previously (27Shresta S. McIvor D.M. Heusel J.H. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts (0.5 μg) of pro-GzmB, rGzmB, or purified nGzmB were used for each lane of an SDS-PAGE reducing protein gel under reducing conditions. The gels were either stained directly with the rapid silver stain kit (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) or transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with immune sera at a 1:500 dilution, as described previously (27Shresta S. McIvor D.M. Heusel J.H. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed using equivalent amounts of pro-GzmB, mature rGzmB, and nGzmB as determined by absorption at 280 nm and by Western blotting. Asp'ase and Met'ase assays were carried out in a 500-μl volume using 3–5 μl of enzyme (0.3–0.5 μg) in assay buffer containing 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.11 mmdithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (Sigma), and 0.1 mmsubstrate. Reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 30 min, and color development was measured at A 405 nm. Background (non-enzymatic) hydrolysis of substrates was assayed using 5 μl of MEB buffer in the same assay buffer, including substrate and DTNB. Tryptase assays were performed in a 200-μl volume using 0.3–0.5 μg of enzyme in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.22 mm DTNB, 0.20 mm N-α-benzylcarbonyl-l-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT), and 0.01% Triton X-100. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding 1 ml of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; color development was measured atA 412 nm. Protease substrates included: Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-S-benzyl (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA) for Asp'ase activity; Boc-Ala-Ala-Met-S-benzyl (Enzyme Systems Products) for Met'ase activity; Boc-Ala-Ala-Phe-S-benzyl (Enzyme Systems Products) for chymase activity; Z-Lys-S-benzyl (Calbiochem) for tryptase activity. Protease inhibitors included:Z-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-FMK (Enzyme Systems Products), Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (Bachem, Torrance, CA), Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CMK (Calbiochem), and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (Calbiochem). Stock solutions of substrates and inhibitors were prepared in Me2SO and stored at −70 °C. Equivalent amounts of rGzmB and nGzmB were defined by Western analysis. The initial rates of hydrolysis were measured at 412 nm (ε412 = 14,150m−1 cm−1) using a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Sugarland, TX) after 10 μl (0.043 μm) of enzyme stock solution was added to a cuvette containing 1.0 ml of buffer, 0.33 mm DTNB, and 40 μl of substrate (10–500 μm) at 20 °C. After substraction for background hydrolysis, measurements were plotted using a KaleidaGraph program (Synergy, Reading, PA), and theK m and k cat for each substrate were determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Correlation coefficients for all plots were >0.99. Endo H treatment of proteins to remove N-linked oligosaccharides was performed in 100-μl reactions using 5 μl (0.5 μg) of pro-GzmB, rGzmB, or nGzmB in an assay buffer containing 75 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and 5 μl of 1 unit/ml Endo H (Sigma). Negative controls were performed using 5 μl of MEB buffer with or without Endo H. The reactions were allowed to incubate overnight at 37 °C. Ten μl of the reaction products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted. Fifty μl of the reaction products were used to assay for Asp'ase activity with Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-S-benzyl as the substrate. 5 μl (0.5 μg) of pro-GzmB was incubated with 0.1–0.4 unit of purified bovine spleen DPPI (Sigma) in 50 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was diluted 10-fold in Asp'ase buffer, and Asp'ase activity was measured as described above with Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-S-benzyl as the substrate. The activity was compared with the activity of equivalent amounts of active rGzmB. For inhibition studies, DPPI was incubated with varying concentrations of glycine-phenylalanine-diazomethylketone (G-F-CHN2) (29Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a potent and specific inhibitor of DPPI, for 2 h prior to the addition of pro-GzmB. The reactions were then allowed to proceed overnight as described above. To control for any direct effect of G-F-CHN2 on Asp'ase activity, active rGzmB was also incubated with G-F-CHN2 prior to the activity assay. mCPP32 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using RNA derived from GzmB-deficient CTL effectors (3Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared as described (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 μg of RNA was incubated with 200 ng of oligo(dT)16 and 50 ng of random hexamers (Perkin-Elmer) for 10 min at 68 °C. After 2 min on ice, 10 mm dNTPS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μl of SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added and incubated at 37 °C for an hour. After adjusting the total volume to 100 μl with diethyl pyrocarbonate water, 1 μl of the first strand cDNA was used as template. The 833-base pair cDNA was then amplified using the forward primer 5′-GATCTCTAGAGGAACGCTAAGAAAAGTGACCATGG-3′ (containing an XbaI site) and the reverse primer 5′-GATCAAGCTTCCTCTAGTGATAAAAGTACAGTTCTTTCG-3′ (containing aHindIII site) and subcloned intoXbaI-HindIII cleaved pBSKS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 35S-Labeled mCPP32 was obtained using T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). One μg of the plasmid DNA was transcribed and translated in the presence of 20 μCi of Trans35S-labeled amino acids (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and 40 μl of the TnT Master Mix for 90 min at 30 °C. Two μl of the translated mixture was either incubated alone, in the presence of equivalent amounts of rGzmB or pro-GzmB (as determined by Western) or in the presence of 25 μg of total protein from an NK-like tumor cell line extract (which contains native GzmB), or from an extract prepared from GzmB−/− CTL effectors. These extracts were generated and prepared as described previously (27Shresta S. McIvor D.M. Heusel J.H. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After 2 h at 37 °C, the samples were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE reducing gel. The gel was then fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Corp.), and autoradiographed for 2 days. P. pastoris is a methanotrophic yeast that has been successfully used to produce large quantities of foreign proteins (reviewed in Refs. 31Nico-Farber K. Harder W. Ab G. VeenHuis M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1331-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 32Romanos M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 527-533Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A major advantage of the P. pastoris expression system is that the foreign protein can be secreted (along with very low levels of native proteins) as the first step of purification. In addition, the secreted proteins are frequently correctly folded and not hyperglycosylated (33Grinna L.S. Tschopp J.F. Yeast. 1989; 5: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We designed two GzmB expression vectors for expression in Pichia: the first form included the codons for the activation dipeptide Gly-Glu (pro-GzmB); the second form starts with the Ile codon at the N terminus of the processed enzyme (rGzmB) (see Fig. 1 A). These cDNAs were cloned in frame with the α-factor signal peptide in pPIC9, which targets them to the secretory pathway. The expressed proteins also contain the KEX2 recognition sequence Glu-Lys-Arg directly preceding Gly-Glu (pro-GzmB) or Ile-Ile (rGzmB), which allows signal peptide cleavage by the endogenous yeast peptidaseKEX2 (34Brake A.J. Merryweather J.P. Coit D.G. Heberlein U.A. Masiarz G.T. Mellenbach G.T. Urdea M.S. Valenzuela P. Barr P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4642-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The supernatant from clones that expressed cleaved pro-GzmB and rGzmB were purified on a Mono S cation exchange column according to the “Experimental Procedures.” The major species detected on silver-stained gels (Fig. 1 B) and in Western analysis (Fig. 1 C) (using reducing conditions) had apparent molecular masses of 30 and 32 kDa. These two bands represent different glycosylated isoforms of the proteins, since Endo H treatment altered the migration of pro-GzmB and rGzmB (as well as nGzmB purified from NK-like cell lines) to approximately 25 kDa (Fig. 1 C), the predicted molecular mass of the mature protein. The deglycosylated forms of rGzmB and nGzmB retained full activity toward thiobenzyl ester substrates (data not shown). The final yield of purified rGzmB from 1 liter of yeast culture was approximately 1 mg. The activity of each recombinant protein was determined using thiobenzyl ester substrates with the same amount of test enzyme, as demonstrated by silver stain and Western analysis (Fig. 1, Band C). An equivalent amount of partially purified nGzmB served as positive control. Pro-GzmB had no measurable Asp'ase activity (Table I and Fig. 4); in contrast, rGmB was fully active. To further quantitate the catalytic efficiency of our active recombinant enzyme, we determined Michaelis-Menten parameters for two known synthetic thiobenzyl ester substrates of nGzmB. rGzmB hydrolyzed Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-S-benzyl with an apparentk cat of 17 s−1 and ak cat/K m of 181,237m−1 s−1 (Table I). The catalytic efficiency of rGzmB is approximately twice that of nGzmB; these values are similar to those reported in the literature by Odake et al. (6Odake S. Kam C.-M. Narasimhan L. Poe M.

Open table in a new tab Previous studies could not determine whether the Met'ase activity detected in purified GzmB preparations was due to GzmB itself or to another unidentified granzyme that coeluted with GzmB (6Odake S. Kam C.-M. Narasimhan L. Poe M. Blake J.T. Krahenbuhl O. Tschopp J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We definitively established that rGzmB hydrolyzes Boc-Ala-Ala-Met-S-benzyl with a k catof 3.2 s−1 and ak cat/K m of 65,306m−1 s−1. Again, the catalytic efficiency of rGzmB as a Met'ase is twice that of nGzmB. The cleavage of Boc-Ala-Ala-Met-S-benzyl suggests that there may be GzmB substrates with Met at the P1 position instead of an Asp. rGzmB has no detectable tryptase or chymase activity (Table I), consistent with previous reports (6Odake S. Kam C.-M. Narasimhan L. Poe M. Blake J.T. Krahenbuhl O. Tschopp J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, caspase-3 is the only caspase that has been shown to be a substrate of GzmB both in vitro as well as in vivo (12Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar, 14Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 presumably exists in all cells in its inactive, 32-kDa proenzyme form. During CTL-mediated attack on susceptible target cells, nGzmB processes caspase-3 to its active p20/p10 heterodimeric form (12Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar, 36Quan L.T. Tewari M. O'Rourke K. Dixit V. Snipas S.J. Poirier G.G. Ray C. Pickup D. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1972-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For this reason, we wished to demonstrate that rGzmB is capable of recognizing and cleaving this physiological substrate. 35S-Labeled caspase-3 was cleaved to its signature p20 form by both nGzmB as well as rGzmB (Fig.2, lanes 3 and 4), whereas neither pro-GzmB nor extracts from CTL effectors deficient in GzmB were capable of processing caspase-3 (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 5). Previous studies have shown that two peptides (Ac-DEVD-CHO (37Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A.

Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 39Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar)) are potent inhibitors of caspase-3 and caspase-1, respectively. A recent study, using a combinatorial approach, defined the tetrapeptide IEPD as an optimal substrate sequence for GzmB (40Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-YVAD-CMK, and ZIETD-FMK (a fluoromethyl ketone that closely matches the optimal substrate for GzmB) to inhibit rGzmB. We found that these peptides have essentially no inhibitory effect on rGzmB (or nGzmB) at concentrations up to 800 μm (Fig.3). It should be noted that the methyl side chains added to ZIETD-FMK to enhance cell permeability might have affected the ability of this peptide to inhibit GzmB in vitro. Prolonged preincubation of the peptides with rGzmB (up to 4 h) did not increase the inhibition (data not shown). 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), a general serine protease inhibitor (4Graubert T.A. Russell J.H. Ley T.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits rGzmB with an IC50 value of approximately 5 μm (Fig. 3). We also tested the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ (a potent inhibitor of caspase-3 with an IC50 of 0.1 μm (26Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18530-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)) and found that Zn2+ has no effect on rGzmB at concentations up to 300 μm. Other cations such as Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe3+, and Ca2+ also had no effect on the activity of rGzmB (data not shown). The ability of GzmB to cleave caspases, and the similarities between the specificities of GzmB and caspases (especially the requirements for Asp in the P1 position and Glu in the P4 position (40Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar)), have suggested that GzmB is an integral part of the caspase cascade leading to cell death. However, more recent reports using specific caspase inhibitors suggest that GzmB may lead to target cell death through a caspase-independent pathway (16Darmon A.J. Ley T.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21709-21712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These reports, and our results with peptide and cation inhibitors, underscore the differences between the two classes of enzymes. Although the sequence IEPD may be an optimal substrate for GzmB in vitro, specific inhibition of GzmB may require additional residues beyond the P4-P1 positions. GzmB, along with the other cytotoxic lymphocyte granzyme family members, is synthesized as a preproenzyme with an 18 residue signal peptide followed by an activation dipeptide Gly-Glu. Activation requires processing of the signal peptide and the activation dipeptide. This dual proteolytic processing pathway appears to apply to the other granzymes, as well as structurally related serine proteases expressed in other hematopoietic cells such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G (21McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mast cell chymases (29Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme involved in the proteolytic processing of the prodipeptide is thought to be the lysosomal cysteine protease DPPI (21McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kummer J.A. Kamp A.M. Citarella F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports on the processing of rGzmB by purified bovine DPPI demonstrated specific (but low level) conversion to the active form of GzmB. Possible explanations include cross-species differences in substrate specificities (i.e. bovine DPPI processing human GzmB), inefficient subcellular colocalization of the two enzymes in transiently transfected COS cells or a requirement for an unidentified granule component to stabilize the proenzyme (20Caputo A. Garner R.S. Winkler U. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17672-17675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of bovine DPPI to process recombinant pro-GzmB to its active form in vitro. We found that at pH 5.0, bovine DPPI efficiently activated pro-GzmB; the degree of activation appears to depend only on the concentration of exogenous DPPI added (Fig.4 A). DPPI itself has no effect on the Asp'ase assay, nor does it affect the activity of mature rGzmB (Fig. 4 A). This suggests that once the prodipeptide is removed, mature GzmB is resistant to further proteolytic cleavage by DPPI. The activation process is inhibited by the highly specific DPPI inhibitor Gly-Phe-CHN2 (29Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at concentrations as low as 0.6 μm (Fig. 4 B). These results, and previous reports (22Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kummer J.A. Kamp A.M. Citarella F. Horrevoets A.J.G. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9281-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicate that DPPI alone is sufficient for the activation of pro-GzmB. A null mutation of DPPI created by homologous recombination in the mouse should confirm the importance or redundancy of this enzyme for the activation of the granzymes and related proteins. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate expression of active rGzmB in a non-mammalian system. The enzyme expressed has the same substrate specificities as the purified native enzyme. Inhibition studies also show that the current peptide-based inhibitors of caspases are ineffective at blocking the activity of GzmB. The Pichia system will allow us to produce large amounts of pure recombinant GzmB for structural studies that may allow us to better define substrate specificities and requirements for GzmB inhibition. We thank Dr. Linda Kurz and Marion Riley (Department of Biochemistry, Washington University) for their expertise and assistance in the determination of rGzmB kinetic constants. We also thank Drs. Tom Daly and Mark Sands for preparation of graphs included in the manuscript and Nancy Reidelberger for preparing the manuscript. We thank Dr. Steve Smeekins for suggesting that we try the Pichia system for the production of granzymes."

Thrombospondin stimulates a rapid loss of focal adhesion plaques and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. The focal adhesion labilizing activity of thrombospondin is localized to the amino-terminal domain, specifically amino acids 17–35. Use of a synthetic peptide (hep I), containing amino acids 17–35 of thrombospondin, enables us to examine the signaling mechanisms specifically involved in thrombospondin-induced disassembly of focal adhesions. We tested the hypothesis that activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase is a necessary step in the thrombospondin-induced signaling pathway regulating focal adhesion disassembly. Both wortmannin and LY294002, membrane permeable inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, blocked hep I-induced disassembly of focal adhesions. Similarly, wortmannin inhibited hep I-mediated actin microfilament reorganization and the hep I-induced translocation of α-actinin from focal adhesion plaques. Hep I also stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity approximately 2–3-fold as measured in anti-phosphoinositide 3-kinase and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Increased immunoreactivity for the 85-kDa regulatory subunit in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates suggests that the p85/p110 form of phosphoinositide 3-kinase is involved in this pathway. In32Pi-labeled cells, hep I increased levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, the major product of phosphoinositide 3-kinase phosphorylation.

Differential expression of these receptors and varying accessibility of the binding domains of TSP1 are potential mechanisms for regulating the effects of TSP1 on cell behavior. However, the multiplicity of domains and receptors that exist for TSP1 has made it difficult to determine the mechanisms by which TSP1 regulates cellular function.

The focal adhesion labilizing activity of TSP1 was localized to the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain, specifically amino acids 17–35 (14Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a synthetic peptide, hep I, containing amino acids 17–35 of TSP1, we can specifically examine mechanisms involved in the disassembly of focal adhesions induced by TSP1 and assess the effect of this activity on endothelial cell function. Previously, we demonstrated that disassembly of focal adhesions in response to hep I is dependent upon cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (15Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Pallero M.A. Boerth N. Greenwood J.A. Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in which PKG is inhibited or deficient no longer respond to hep I. However, PKG does not appear to be activated by hep I and activation of PKG does not stimulate disassembly of focal adhesions. These results suggest that basal PKG activity is important for the process of focal adhesion disassembly stimulated by TSP1. The signaling mechanisms involved in regulating TSP1-induced disassembly of focal adhesions remain to be elucidated. A candidate signaling cascade is that involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This family of lipid kinases has been shown to be involved in mitogenesis, vesicle trafficking, integrin activation, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (for reviews on PI 3-kinase, see Refs. 16Vanhaesebroeck B. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 249-270PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 18Shimizu Y. Hunt III, S.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase was first identified as a phosphatidylinositol kinase activity associated with the virally encoded protein tyrosine kinase v-Src in cell extracts (19Sugimoto Y. Whitman M. Cantley L.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2117-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 20Macara I.G. Marinetti G.V. Balduzzi P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2728-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The structure of this form of PI 3-kinase was determined to be a heterodimer consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 249-270PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The p85/p110 PI 3-kinase is activated by interaction of the regulatory subunit, which contains two SH2 domains, one SH3 domain, and two proline-rich sequences, with receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 249-270PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The 110-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase, which has been shown to be inhibited directly by wortmannin and LY294002, catalyzes phosphorylation on the 3-position of phosphoinositides leading to increases in phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PtdIns (3,4)-P2) and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5)-P3) (16Vanhaesebroeck B.

Although PI 3-kinase has been demonstrated to be involved in a multiplicity of cellular functions, the exact role of its lipid products in cell signaling is not clear. Recent evidence suggests that the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides initiate downstream signaling by rapidly recruiting and/or activating target proteins. For example, both PtdIns (3,4)-P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)-P3 activate calcium-independent protein kinase C types ε, η, and δ (26Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). PtdIns (3,4,5)-P3 has been demonstrated to compete with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins for binding to SH2 domains, suggesting that PtdIns (3,4,5)-P3 may recruit SH2-containing proteins to specific compartments of the cell (29Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Evidence is also accumulating that 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides bind to and modulate actin-regulatory proteins such as profilin and gelsolin (30Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L.

The diversity of cellular events involving PI 3-kinases suggest that complex regulatory mechanisms must exist to generate specific signals. Implication of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton prompted us to propose that PI 3-kinase is involved in the TSP1-induced disassembly of focal adhesions and reorganization of actin microfilaments. In current studies, we present evidence that TSP1 stimulates the activation of PI 3-kinase and that PI 3-kinase is a component of the signaling pathway mediating TSP1-induced disassembly of focal adhesions and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Hep I (ELTGAARKGSGRRLVKGPD) and scrambled hep I (RSKAGTLGERDLKPGARVG) were synthesized, purified, and analyzed by the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center/Peptide Synthesis and Analysis shared facility. Phosphatidylinositol was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Wortmannin, mouse monoclonal antibody to α-actinin (clone BM752), protein A-Sepharose, crude brain phosphoinositides, and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate were purchased from Sigma. Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns (4,5)-P2) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and LY294002 from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-p85-PI 3-kinase (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-phosphotyrosine (mouse monoclonal, clone PY20 and RC20) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-p85-PI 3-kinase (rabbit polyclonal) agarose beads and anti-p85-PI 3-kinase (mouse monoclonal) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY).32Pi was from ICN. [32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham. Bodipy-phallicidin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM was purchased from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). TSP1 was purified from fresh (24–48 h) human platelets purchased from the Birmingham American Red Cross as described previously (14Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAE cells were isolated and cultured in DMEM containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described previously (14Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Focal adhesion assays were performed as described (12Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAE cells were grown on glass coverslips in DMEM with 20% FBS until near confluence. Cells were rinsed with warm DMEM to remove serum components and incubated in DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with hep I (0.1–1 μm) or TSP1 (10 μg/ml = 0.078 μm monomer), fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde, and examined by interference reflection microscopy. A minimum of 300 cells/condition was evaluated for the presence of focal adhesions. A cell was scored positive if it contained at least 3 adhesion plaques. Cells were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and precleared by centrifugation. Supernatants (1 mg/ml) were incubated with anti-p85-PI 3-kinase (4 μg/ml) or PY20 (10 μg/ml) for 2 h on ice. Protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and assayed for PI 3-kinase activity or immunoblotted. PI 3-kinase activity in anti-p85-PI 3-kinase and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) immunoprecipitates was assayed as described (36Jackson T.R. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed 2 times with kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.8 mmNa3VO4, and 30 mm NaCl). A volume of 30 μl containing the protein A-Sepharose beads and kinase buffer was left remaining in the tube. Twenty microliters of lipid (see below) was added to the beads, vortexed, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was started by adding 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 17.5 μm ATP (25 μCi of [32P]ATP/sample) and 17.5 mm MgCl2. The samples were vortexed and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 500 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (3:6:1). Lipids were then extracted by adding 175 μl of chloroform and 175 μl of 1m HCl, vortexing, and centrifuging to separate the phases. The lower phase was removed, added to 630 μl of methanol, 1m HCl/chloroform (16:15.8:1), vortexed, and centrifuged. The lower phase was removed and the lipids separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates precoated with 1% potassium oxalate. The plates were developed in methanol/chloroform/water/ammonium hydroxide (8:6:2:1) when phosphatidylinositol was the substrate and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:7) when PtdIns (4,5)-P2 was the substrate (37Chellaiah M. Hruska K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The TLC plates were exposed for autoradiography and quantitated using video-enhanced densitometry. The positions of PtdIns-P, PtdIns-P2, and PtdIns-P3 as migrated on the TLC plate was visualized by exposing the plate to I2 vapor and identified using purified standards. To prepare the lipid substrates, phosphatidylinositol was dried from the purchased chloroform solution and then sonicated into kinase buffer containing 0.2% deoxycholate and 3.5 mm dithiothreitol until clear to achieve a concentration of 3 μg/ml. PtdIns (4,5)-P2 was prepared for phosphorylation by drying down with an equal amount of phosphatidylserine and sonicating into kinase buffer containing 3.5 mm dithiothreitol to get concentrations of 1.5 μg/ml PtdIns (4,5)-P2 and 1.5 μg/ml phosphatidylserine. Analysis of hep I-stimulated incorporation of 32P into the lipids in intact cells was performed as described (38Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). BAE cells were grown to approximately 80% confluency in a 100-mm culture dish. Cells were incubated overnight in 0.2% FBS/DMEM. The media was changed to phosphate-free DMEM and incubated for 1 h. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 1.6 mCi/ml32Pi. Cells were stimulated for 10 min. The media was aspirated and the cells scraped and collected in 750 μl of methanol, 1 m HCl (1:1); 20 μg of crude phosphoinositides was added as a carrier. The lipids were extracted by adding 380 μl of chloroform and shaking 15 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged to separate the phases and the upper phase discarded. The extracted lipids were washed two times with 500 μl of methanol, 0.1m EDTA (1:0.9), separated by TLC, and analyzed as described above. These plates were developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:7). BAE cells were stained with Bodipy-phallicidin or α-actinin as described previously (14Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells stained for α-actinin were extracted with Triton X-100 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 5 min on ice prior to fixation. Soluble proteins were extracted in Triton X-100 buffer as described above. The extracted cells were rinsed 2 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice and the insoluble proteins collected in electrophoresis sample buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry (39Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after acid precipitation. Samples (30 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked, probed, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). A statistically significant decrease in focal adhesions can be observed in spread BAE cells 8 min following administration of hep I, the active sequence from TSP1, with disassembly complete after 20 min and stable for at least 60 min (Fig.1). To determine whether PI 3-kinase was involved in TSP1-induced disassembly of focal adhesions, cells were treated with hep I in the presence of wortmannin or LY294002, membrane permeable inhibitors of PI 3-kinase activity. Wortmannin, an irreversible inhibitor acting at the lipid-binding site (21Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Ui M.

Focal adhesion disassembly stimulated by the intact TSP1 protein was also completely inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 (Table I). As previously reported (14Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells display thick stress fibers terminating at the focal adhesion plaques, while the microfilaments in hep I-treated cells appeared thinner, with a more peripheral distribution (12Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if PI 3-kinase was involved in the TSP1-induced rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, the microfilaments were examined in control and hep I-treated BAE cells pretreated in the absence or presence of 5 nm wortmannin. Consistent with previous observations, phallicidin-stained F-actin microfilaments in hep I-treated cells (Fig.3 b) exhibit a more peripheral distribution as compared with the more centrally located stress fibers terminating at focal adhesion plaques in control cells (Fig.3 a). The hep I-stimulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton was completely inhibited by 5 nm wortmannin (Fig. 3 d) with F-actin staining similar to the non-hep I-treated controls. Treatment with wortmannin alone did not appear to affect F-actin microfilament organization (Fig. 3 c). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase activity is required for the rearrangement of actin microfilaments induced by hep I. α-Actinin is an actin-regulatory protein which binds directly to actin filaments as well as to other components of focal adhesions forming the protein network anchoring microfilaments to the membrane at contact sites (40Burridge K.

The localization of α-actinin was examined in control and hep I-treated cells in the absence or presence of 5 nm wortmannin. Since previous studies have reported that antibody accessibility to focal adhesion localized α-actinin is limited (42Pavalko F.M. Schneider G. Burridge K. Lim S.-S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), cells were extracted with Triton X-100 buffer prior to fixation and staining. Under these conditions, antibody specific for α-actinin intensely stained focal adhesion plaques (Fig.4 a). Staining for α-actinin was also observed along actin microfilaments in a beaded pattern. In hep I-treated cells, a decrease in α-actinin staining of focal adhesions in comparison to controls was observed (Fig. 4 b), although the beaded pattern of staining was only slightly decreased. Wortmannin inhibited the hep I-induced decrease in α-actinin staining of focal adhesion plaques (Fig. 4 d) without affecting α-actinin localization in control cells (Fig. 4 c). Thes"
https://openalex.org/W1968711917,"Abstract Two genes isolated from Schwanniomyces occidentalis, ENA1 and ENA2, encode P-type ATPases highly homologous to the Na-ATPases ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae and complement the Na+sensitivity of an S. cerevisiae mutant strain lacking its own Na-ATPases. The expression of both ENA1 andENA2 was highly dependent on a high external pH, but whereas a high pH was sufficient for the expression ofENA2, the expression of ENA1 required a high pH and the presence of Na+. Disruption of ENA1rendered the cells less tolerant to Na+ than the wild-type strain and decreased their capacity for Na+ extrusion. Disruption of ENA2 did not affect Na+tolerance, but decreased both the growth at high pH and K+efflux. We discuss these results and propose that fungal Na-ATPases should be considered alkali cation ATPases. By sequence comparison, we found that fungal Na-ATPases form a homogeneous group that can be distinguished from other cation-pumping P-type ATPases, except from the cta3 Ca-ATPase of Schizosaccharomyces pombe."
https://openalex.org/W2075413467,"Proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane display a wide variety of orientations, many spanning the membrane more than once. Some of these proteins are synthesized with NH2-terminal cleavable targeting sequences (presequences) whereas others are targeted to mitochondria via internal signals. Here we report that two distinct mitochondrial targeting signals can be present in precursors of inner membrane proteins, an NH2-terminal one and a second, internal one. Using cytochrome c 1 as a model protein, we demonstrate that these two mitochondrial targeting signals operate independently of each other. The internal targeting signal, consisting of a transmembrane segment and a stretch of positively charged amino acid residues directly following it, initially directs the translocation of the preprotein into the intermembrane space. It then inserts into the inner membrane from the intermembrane space side in a Δψ-dependent manner and thereby determines the orientation the protein attains in the inner membrane. Analysis of a number of other presequence-containing protein of the inner membrane suggest that they too contain such internal targeting signals.

The nuclear-encoded proteins contain mitochondrial targeting signals which ensure their targeting to mitochondria following their synthesis in the cytosol. Many of these proteins bear NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting signals (presequences) which, in addition to their targeting function, facilitate the early steps in the Δψ-dependent translocation across the inner membrane (2Hurt E.C. Pesold-Hurt B. Schatz G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Mellman I. Rosenberg L.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Upon import into the matrix these signals are proteolytically removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; Cytc 1, cytochromec 1; mt-Hsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; Δψ, mitochondrial membrane potential; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; Cytc 1, cytochromec 1; mt-Hsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; Δψ, mitochondrial membrane potential; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Cell. 1988; 53: 795-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). A wide range of inner membrane proteins, however, do not have such cleavable presequences, but are targeted to mitochondria by means of internal signals. Very little is known about the nature of internal targeting signals, although recently one such signal has been described for the Bcs1p protein (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A stretch of positively charged amino acid residues located directly after the single transmembrane segment of the protein serves to target Bcs1p to mitochondria, where it attains an Nout-Cin orientation in the inner membrane. This stretch has the potential to form an amphipathic helix, displaying all positive charges on one side and a range of apolar ones on the other. It is thought that the apolar face of the helical structure interacts with the neighboring transmembrane segment to form a hairpin loop structure which penetrates the translocase of the inner membrane in a Δψ-dependent fashion (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Other proteins of the inner membrane of mitochondria also contain such positively charged residues immediately following their transmembrane segments; from the topological arrangement of the proteins these residues are known to be localized on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Interestingly some of the proteins containing such putative internal mitochondrial targeting signals also bear NH2-terminal cleavable presequences. This observation raises some important questions with regards to the role of internal mitochondrial targeting signals and intra-mitochondrial protein sorting. Can a preprotein contain more than one functional mitochondrial targeting signal? If so, do these signals operate independently of each other? What role do the internal signals play in the attainment of the final orientation of these proteins in the inner membrane? To address these questions we analyzed the targeting and import mechanisms of cytochrome c 1. Cytochromec 1, a subunit of the cytochromebc 1 complex of the respiratory chain, is anchored to the inner membrane in an Nout-Cinorientation via a single transmembrane segment near its COOH terminus (7Xia D. Yu C.-A. Hoeon K. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). It is synthesized as a precursor protein, precytochromec 1 which contains an NH2-terminal cleavable bipartite presequence (8Sadler J. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Römisch J. Tropschug M. Sebald W. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The first part of this presequence is a mitochondrial targeting signal which becomes proteolytically removed by MPP in the matrix to generate an intermediate size cytochrome c 1 (intermediate size Cytc 1). The second domain of the bipartite sequence, a hydrophobic sorting sequence, directs the protein to the inner membrane, whereby the NH2 terminus of the intermediate size Cytc 1 is maintained in the matrix. Following the covalent addition of heme, intermediate size Cytc 1 undergoes a second processing event, catalyzed by the Imp2p protease 2 (10Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), thus resulting in the release of a free NH2 terminus in the intermembrane space. The transmembrane segment at the COOH-terminal end of the protein serves to anchor the protein to the inner membrane with the carboxyl terminus exposed to the matrix. How this transmembrane segment becomes correctly sorted during the import pathway of cytochromec 1 was not clear until now. We demonstrate here that this COOH-terminal transmembrane segment of precytochrome c 1, together with a stretch of positively charged amino acids which directly follow it, constitute an internal mitochondrial targeting signal. Consequently precytochromec 1 bears two distinct targeting signals, an NH2-terminal cleavable one and a second internal one. We show here that these targeting signals operate independently from each other and are both essential to achieve the efficient import and attainment of the correct orientation of cytochromec 1 in the inner membrane. Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type strain (D273-10B) was grown in lactate medium (11Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis D.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, New York1994: 538-544Google Scholar) at 30 °C. The Tim22(Gal10) strain (12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was grown at 30 °C in minimal medium supplemented with 2% lactate, 0.1% glucose and either in the presence (Tim22↑) or absence (Tim22↓) of 1% galactose for five generations. The Tim23(fs) strain and its isogenic wild-type strain (12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) were grown at 24 °C in minimal medium with 2% lactate, 0.1% glucose, and 1% galactose. Cells were harvested at an OD578 of ∼1 and mitochondria were isolated, as described previously (11Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis D.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, New York1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA (SEM buffer) at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The recombinant DNA techniques applied were as described by Sambrooket al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast precytochrome c 1was used in this analysis. All the cytochromec 1-DHFR variants used were cloned by obtaining the required cytochrome c 1 regions through designed polymerase chain reaction and ligating them before DHFR asEcoRI/BamHI fragments. A DHFR derivative, DHFRmut was used which bears a number of point mutations, whereby Cys-7, Ser-42, and Asn-49 were replaced by Ser, Cys, and Cys, respectively (14Teichmann U. van Dyck L. Guiard B. Fischer H. Glockshuber R. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 10137-10142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DNA encoding precursor proteins were cloned in pGEM vectors and were transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase. All precursor proteins were then synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp.) in the presence of [35S]methionine (15Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). Import was performed essentially as described (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Import mixtures contained 2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 0.25 mg/ml mitochondrial protein, and 1–2% (v/v) reticulocyte lysate containing the radiolabeled precursor proteins and was performed at 25 °C for the times indicated. Following import, samples were treated with proteinase K (40 μg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C either under nonswelling or hypotonic swelling conditions (see below) (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting onto nitrocellulose. The efficiency of swelling of the mitochondria was assessed following immunodecoration of the blot with antisera against endogenous cytochrome c peroxidase (soluble intermembrane space protein) and Mge1p (matrix protein). Isolated mitochondria were depleted of their free matrix ATP, as described previously (16Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. van der Klei I. Guiard B. Koll H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria following dilution in import buffer were incubated at 25 °C for 3 min and then oligomycin (20 μm), carboxyatractyloside (5 μm), and NADH (2 mm) were successively added at 3-min intervals. When matrix ATP levels were to be restored in depleted mitochondria an alternative depletion protocol using oligomycin and apyrase was used as described before (17Gruhler A. Arnold I. Seytter T. Guiard B. Schwarz E.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17410-17415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Matrix ATP was replenished by incubating the reisolated mitochondria in the presence of 4 mm ATP. Protein determination, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were performed according to the published methods of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar), Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), Towbin et al. (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 79: 267-271Google Scholar), respectively. The detection of proteins after blotting onto nitrocellulose was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of cytochrome c 1 indicated the presence of a positively charged region immediately after the transmembrane segment at the COOH-terminal end of the protein. This sequence displayed the potential to form an amphipathic α-helical structure with positively charged residues on one side and an abundance of apolar amino acids on the opposite side (Fig.1 A). This arrangement of amino acid residues resembles the internal mitochondrial targeting signal recently described for the inner membrane protein, Bcs1p (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To address whether this region could also function as such an internal import signal, a chimeric protein, Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR, consisting of the final 63 residues of the COOH-terminal region of cytochromec 1 fused to a mutated form of DHFR was constructed (Fig. 1 B). This region of cytochromec 1 (amino acid 247–309) encompasses the transmembrane segment flanked by 26 residues at its NH2terminus and directly followed by the positively charged segment (amino acid residues 288–303), together with the final 6 residues of cytochrome c 1. The mutated form of DHFR bears a number of point mutations which cause a destabilization in the folded structure of the protein whereby in contrast to its wild-type counterpart, the mutated DHFR remains sensitive to added proteases (14Teichmann U. van Dyck L. Guiard B. Fischer H. Glockshuber R. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 10137-10142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If imported and sorted by the same mechanism as authentic cytochromec 1, Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR (molecular mass 28 kDa) should be located in the inner membrane with an Nout-Cin orientation (Fig. 1 C). Radiolabeled Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR was indeed imported in a membrane potential (Δψ)-dependent manner into both isolated mitochondria and mitoplasts (Fig. 1 D). Hypotonic swelling of mitochondria following import combined with protease treatment resulted in the degradation of the N-tail exposed to the intermembrane space and protection of a larger fragment corresponding to DHFR plus the transmembrane segment (approximately 25 kDa). A similar fragment was observed upon protease treatment after import into mitoplasts. This result indicates that the COOH-terminal DHFR had been imported across the inner membrane and had attained the predicted Nout-Cin orientation. It appeared necessary to exclude the possible existence of a cryptic targeting signal in the passenger protein used above, the mutated form of DHFR (DHFRmut). Furthermore, it was important to verify that the positively charged amino acid segment (residues 288–303) together with the neighboring transmembrane segment, were responsible for the mitochondrial targeting observed. To this end, the following set of chimeric proteins were constructed (Fig.2 A). The first construct, DHFRmut, was not imported to a protease protected location, although it became associated with mitochondria (Fig. 2 B). Thus this unfolded mutated derivative of DHFR does not contain a cryptic import signal. Second, a Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR derivative in which the transmembrane segment was deleted, Cytc 1-(ΔTM-C)-DHFR was also not imported into isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2 B). Third, placement of the positively charged residues (residues 288–303) of cytochromec 1 at the NH2 terminus of DHFR, Cytc 1-(288–309)-DHFR resulted in the efficient import into mitochondria in a Δψ-dependent manner where it was located in the matrix (Fig. 2 B). Thus this stretch of positively charged amino acids can act as an NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. In a further derivative, the DHFR moiety of Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR was exchanged for another passenger protein, the matrix domain of Bcs1p (ΔN-BCS1). This domain of Bcs1p does not contain any targeting information, as previously demonstrated (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein, Cytc 1-(TM-C)-(ΔN-BCS1), was efficiently imported into mitochondria (Fig. 2 B). Taken together these observations rule out the possibility that a cryptic import signal in DHFR becomes exposed when placed COOH-terminal to the cytochrome c 1 segment. Rather, the positively charged segment of residues 288–303 of predicted α-helical structure together with the transmembrane segment functions as an internal signal. We propose that this targeting signal forms a loop structure in which the apolar face of the amphipathic α-helix interacts with the hydrophobic transmembrane segment, similar to the targeting signal of the Bcs1p (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Does this COOH-terminal internal mitochondrial targeting signal function as a second independent targeting signal in the cytochrome c 1preprotein? To address this question a series of fusion proteins were constructed where the COOH-terminal segment followed by the DHFR moiety (Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR) was fused to NH2-terminal regions of precytochromec 1 (Fig.3 A). When fused behind the complete bipartite presequence, pCytc 1(1–64)-(TM-C)-DHFR, efficient import and MPP processing of the cleavable matrix-targeting sequence was observed. Hypotonic swelling in the presence of added protease resulted in the degradation to a fragment (Fig. 3 B, f) which could be immunoprecipitated with DHFR specific antiserum (results not shown). Thus the DHFR domain was located in the matrix, while the linker of hydrophilic amino acid residues between the bipartite presequence and the transmembrane segment remained in the intermembrane space, accessible to the added protease (depicted in Fig. 3 C). A similar orientation was achieved after the import of pCytc 1(1–309)-DHFR, a chimeric protein of the complete precytochrome c 1 protein fused to DHFR (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, when fused to only the matrix-targeting domain of the cytochromec 1 bipartite presequence pCytc 1(1–35)-(TM-C)-DHFR, import into isolated mitochondria in a Δψ-dependent fashion was observed together with maturation by MPP (Fig. 3 B). This chimeric protein was, however, located completely in the matrix; the NH2-terminal presequence had apparently overridden the internal targeting and sorting signals as the Nout-Cin orientation in the inner membrane had not been achieved (depicted in Fig. 3 C). Thus, the COOH-terminal transmembrane segment can operate as an internal targeting signal and become correctly sorted across the inner membrane in the presence of the complete NH2-terminal bipartite presequence. In the absence of the hydrophobic sorting signal, i.e. in the presence of the NH2-terminal matrix-targeting signal alone, the preprotein becomes targeted completely to the matrix. Thus the COOH-terminal transmembrane segment appears not to have the capacity to act as a reinsertion signal from the matrix side of the inner membrane. Can these two targeting signals operate independently of each other and sequentially, to achieve the correct orientation of cytochromec 1 in the inner membrane? In an attempt to dissect the operation of the two targeting signals, a kinetic analysis of the import and sorting of radiolabeled pCytc 1(1–64)-(TM-C)-DHFR into isolated mitoplasts was performed at 12 °C. Rapid processing by MPP was observed, indicating translocation of the NH2-terminal region of pCytc 1(1–64)-(TM-C)-DHFR across the inner membrane (Fig. 4 A). At these early times the DHFR moiety remained protease accessible, demonstrating it had not yet undergone translocation across the inner membrane. Completion of import of this COOH-terminal domain was observed at later times of incubation (depicted in Fig. 4 B). A similar kinetic dissection of NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal targeting and import events was also achieved during the import of pCytc 1(1–309)-DHFR (results not shown). In conclusion, the internal mitochondrial targeting signal of cytochrome c 1 can act independently of the NH2-terminal cleavable presequence. In addition, the COOH-terminal transmembrane segment of cytochromec 1 does not operate as a signal for export following prior import into the matrix. Instead, it functions as an insertion signal from the intermembrane space side of the inner membrane, penetrating the inner membrane in a Δψ-dependent fashion. Import of preproteins across the inner membrane into the matrix is facilitated by the ATP-dependent binding of mt-Hsp70. To address whether the import and sorting of the COOH-terminal region of cytochromec 1 requires mt-Hsp70, the import of the DHFR-derived fusion proteins was analyzed in ATP-depleted mitochondria. Matrix ATP depletion did not have an adverse effect on the import of Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR, pCytc 1(1–64)-(TM-C)-DHFR, and pCytc 1(1–309)-DHFR; the efficiency of import was comparable to that in the control ATP-containing mitochondria (Fig.5 A). In contrast, hypotonic swelling of the mitochondria following import revealed that the translocation of the COOH-terminal DHFR into the matrix, facilitated by the internal targeting signal, was severely inhibited in the absence of the ATP-dependent activity of mt-Hsp70 (Fig. 5 A, f). Consequently in the presence of the bipartite presequence or when acting alone, the Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR-derived fusion proteins can be imported into mitochondria in a mt-Hsp70-independent manner, where their DHFR moiety accumulates in the intermembrane space. Although translocation of the NH2-terminal presequence leading to MPP processing can occur independently of mt-Hsp70, passage of the COOH-terminal segments across the inner membrane requires productive mt-Hsp70. Once accumulated in the intermembrane space, such “ATP-depletion intermediates” were further transported across the inner membrane upon restoration of matrix ATP levels (Fig. 5 B). The efficiency of this chase reaction was not affected by the prior dissipation of the membrane potential by valinomycin (Fig.5 B). Thus the internal targeting signal can penetrate the inner membrane to beyond the Δψ-dependent step of import without requiring mt-Hsp70. Upon doing so it becomes stabilized and does not undergo retrograde translocation out of the inner membrane. This insertion step may be sufficient to ensure the translocation of the short COOH-terminal domain of the authentic cytochrome c 1 (22 amino acids); import and sorting of cytochrome c 1 has been reported to occur in a matrix-ATP independent manner (21Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4787-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, further translocation of the larger DHFR moiety at the COOH terminus across the inner membrane requires the action of the ATP-driven mt-Hsp70, but no longer the Δψ. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains at least two distinct preprotein translocases, which differ in their substrate specificity. The Tim17/Tim23 translocase mediates the import of NH2-terminal presequence-targeted preproteins and its function is tightly coupled to that of the ATP-dependent chaperone, mt-Hsp70 (22Kübrich M.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, insertion of proteins of the carrier family into the inner membrane is facilitated by a second translocase, of which the recently identified Tim22 is a component (12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Does Tim22 translocase represent a general import site for proteins with internal targeting signals? In the yeast strain Tim22(Gal10), the Gal10 promoter was integrated into the chromosome before the Tim22 gene, thus allowing regulated expression of Tim22 by galactose (12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from Tim22(Gal10) cells grown for five generations in the presence (Tim22↑) or absence of galactose (Tim22↓). Tim22↓ mitochondria display a strongly impaired ability to import the ADP/ATP carrier protein (Fig. 6 A and Ref. 12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Import and correct sorting of Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR, like the control NH2-terminal presequence-containing preprotein, pSu9(1–79)-DHFR, were unaffected in Tim22↓ mitochondria (Fig. 6 A and Ref. 12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This result indicates that Tim22 is not involved in the recognition and translocation of the internal targeting signal of cytochrome c 1. To address the role of the Tim23/Tim17 translocase in this event, Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR was imported into Tim23(fs) mitochondria. These mitochondria harbor a variant of Tim23, bearing a short COOH-terminal deletion due to a translation frameshift after methionine 178 (12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Import of NH2-terminal presequence-targeted preproteins into Tim23(fs) mitochondria is drastically reduced, whereas the import of ADP/ATP carrier protein and other members of the carrier family is as efficient as in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 6 B and Ref. 12Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Both import and sorting of Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR, however, were unaffected in mitochondria isolated from the Tim23(fs) mutant (Fig.6 B). Furthermore, treatment of mitoplasts prior to import to remove the NH2-terminal hydrophilic domain of Tim23 which is exposed to the intermembrane space, results in the inhibition of both MPP processing and import of presequence-targeted preproteins; import of Cytc 1-(TM-C)-DHFR in contrast was unaffected by this treatment (results not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the import of the internal targeting signal of cytochrome c 1 does not display the same requirements for Tim23 as presequence-targeted preproteins. It could be speculated that the internal mitochondrial targeting signal present at the COOH-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for sorting of cytochrome c 1 across both the outer and inner membrane. Indeed cytochrome c 1 from the non-pathogenic trypanosomatids Crithidia fasciculata andBodo caudatus were reported to be synthesized without NH2-terminal presequences (26Priest J.W. Wood Z.A. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Is the NH2-terminal presequence of cytochromec 1 dispensable for import of yeast cytochromec 1? We tested the ability of the internal mitochondrial targeting signal to import fusion proteins containing increasing lengths of the mature cytochrome c 1sequence at their NH2 terminus (Fig.7 A). The internal mitochondrial targeting signal of these fusion proteins conferred import of NH2-terminal regions of cytochromec 1, with low, but distinct efficiency, its capacity being reached at approximately 70 amino acid residues (Fig.7 B). Longer proteins become partially imported, whereby a segment corresponding to the DHFR moiety is found in the matrix (results not shown). Thus the internal mitochondrial targeting signal can mediate the initial import into the intermembrane space of only a limited COOH-terminal region of cytochrome c 1. We predict the additional NH2-terminal presequence is essential to achieve complete import of the NH2-terminal region of yeast cytochrome c 1. We describe here a novel mechanism of topogenesis of a precursor protein destined for the inner membrane of mitochondria which contains two distinct targeting signals, an NH2-terminal cleavable one and an internal one. These signals mediate the Δψ-dependent insertion of different segments of the preprotein across the inner membrane from the intermembrane space and operate independently of each other. They play an essential role in the intramitochondrial sorting, as only together they ensure the attainment of the correct orientation of the protein in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The internal signal of cytochrome c 1 is a composite one; it consists of the transmembrane segment and the positively charged stretch of amino acids directly following it. This signal directs import of the COOH-terminal region of precytochromec 1 initially into the intermembrane space (Fig.8). In the presence of a Δψ, the internal targeting sequence inserts across the inner membrane, presumably by adopting a hairpin loop structure. This is similar to the internal import signal described for the Bcs1p (6Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The internal targeting signal operates from the intermembrane space side of the inner membrane to sort the COOH-terminal region of cytochromec 1 to the matrix and to anchor the transmembrane segment in the inner membrane. Our present evidence would speak against the transmembrane segment operating as an export signal from the matrix. Indeed if targeted to the matrix by an NH2-terminal matrix targeting sequence, the protein remains in the matrix and appears incompetent for subsequent sorting. This is in contrast to a number of other inner membrane proteins whose transmembrane segments have been demonstrated to facilitate export of hydrophilic segments from the matrix to the intermembrane space (27Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of import and sorting of a number of presequence-targeted inner membrane proteins appear to adhere to the same principle. They contain potential internal mitochondrial targeting signals COOH-terminal to their second transmembrane segment, in addition to their NH2-terminal presequences. These proteins include, for example, Yta10p (Afg3p), Yta12p (Rca1p) (30Guélin E. Rep M. Grivell L.A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Schnall R. Mannhaupt G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Shy1p which spans the inner membrane twice appears to be divided into two functional domains. Both domains can be separately expressed to form a functional protein (34Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This finding implies that both of these domains contain their own independent mitochondrial targeting and submitochondrial sorting signals. We propose therefore that the positively charged stretch of amino acids located directly COOH-terminal to the second transmembrane segment of Shy1p forms an independent internal targeting signal, similar to that described here for cytochromec 1. Which protein translocase facilitates the passage of these internal targeting signals across the inner membrane? Insertion of the internal targeting signal of cytochrome c 1 occurs in mitochondria in which the Tim22 translocase was strongly reduced such that members of carrier family were no longer imported; thus Tim22 does not operate as a general translocase for those preproteins containing internal targeting signals. Furthermore, the internal targeting signal of cytochrome c 1 does not display requirements for Tim23 which are similar to those of presequence-containing preproteins. The latter, in contrast, require the presence of the large NH2-terminal hydrophilic domain of Tim23, suggesting it may act as a presequence receptor. Our data do not exclude the possibility that a membrane spanning domain of Tim23, which may be protected in the trypsin pretreated mitoplasts, may suffice for the passage of the internal targeting signal of cytochrome c 1. Alternatively, these data may suggest that Tim17 is involved in mediating the recognition and translocation across the inner membrane of these internal targeting signals in a manner independent of the Tim23. Finally, how can the observation of cytochromec 1 containing a second independent targeting signal be reconciled with earlier models of cytochromec 1 sorting? Previously it had been suggested that the cytochrome c 1 was first imported via the matrix (“conservative sorting” model) (35Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Together with the NH2-terminal sorting signal, the transmembrane segment was postulated to reinsert into the inner membrane from the matrix resulting in the export of hydrophilic segment between them. We propose the following alterations to the model of cytochromec 1 sorting to take account of the observations made here (Fig. 8). Cytochrome c 1 undergoes two distinct sorting events to gain its final orientation in the inner membrane. The COOH-terminal sorting event as described above occurs from the intermembrane space and hence does not require prior import into the matrix. The events in the sorting of the NH2terminus are presently unresolved (Fig. 8). A number of lines of evidence are in accordance with the NH2-terminal cleavable sorting signal being imported into the matrix (35Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 36Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 37Stuart R.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), however, it has also been argued that the sorting signal becomes arrested in the TIM machinery during the import step (“stop-transfer” model) (21Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4787-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 39Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Whereas the model of conservative sorting may adequately describe the sorting of a number of nuclear-encoded proteins (27Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), both it, and a stop-transfer type of model may be too simplistic to describe the complex reactions in the sorting process of cytochromec 1. We favor a model where the NH2-terminal sorting signal does not become arrested during import, but rather passes into the matrix by a default mechanism. Fig.8 illustrates these alternative mechanisms which need to be addressed in further experiments to study the multistep processes of cytochromec 1 topogenesis.

We report that disruption of ligation between α5α1 and fibronectin by integrin α5 subunit or fibronectin monoclonal antibodies stimulated DNA synthesis in growth-arrested FET human colon carcinoma cells. This stimulation only occurred when monoclonal antibody was added in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle after release from quiescence by fresh medium. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by α5 or fibronectin antibody was concentration- and time-dependent. FET cells expressed α4β1 integrin (another fibronectin receptor); however, addition of anti-human integrin α4monoclonal antibody had no effect on DNA synthesis. Treatment with α5 monoclonal antibody led to a marked increase in the expression of CDK4 in G1 phase of the cell cycle and consequently increased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. α5 monoclonal antibody treatment increased both cyclin A- and cyclin E-associated kinase activity which was accompanied by increased protein levels of CDK2 and cyclin A. Western blotting of immunoprecipitates demonstrated increased CDK2-cyclin E and CDK2-cyclin A complexes in cells treated with α5 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, disruption of α5α1/fibronectin ligation activated mitogen-activated protein kinase p44 and p42 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2). Pretreatment of the cells with a specific inhibitor of MEK-1, PD98059, blocked the α5 monoclonal antibody-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. In addition PD98059 prevented α5monoclonal antibody-induced DNA synthesis. Since α5α1 ligation to fibronectin is associated with decreased growth parameters, our results indicate that ligation of α5α1 integrin to fibronectin results in suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase activity which in turn inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity in growth-arrested cells.

Integrins are a large family of cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion (1Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimers consisting of an α subunit and a β subunit. The α subunit is non-covalently associated with the β subunit. Both α and β subunits are transmembrane proteins with large extracellular domains that interact with extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FN, fibronectin; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SM, supplemental McCoy's 5A; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. proteins and relatively small cytoplasmic domains that interact with cytoskeletal proteins (2Burridge K.

Therefore, integrins can act as signaling receptors and transmit growth regulatory signals from the extracellular matrix to the interior of the cell (5Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). It has been shown that, upon ligand binding, integrins regulate many intracellular signaling pathways that involve cytoplasmic alkalinization, intracellular Ca2+fluctuation, inositol lipid metabolism, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and phosphatidylinositol kinase (5Juliano R.L.

Integrin α5α1, a fibronectin (FN) receptor, has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression, cell growth, and tumorigenicity. Overexpression of the α5α1 integrin in tumorigenic Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to decreased tumorigenicity (12Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). A variant of K562 erythroleukemia cells selected for increased ability to attach to fibronectin showed a 5-fold up-regulation of α5α1 expression and displayed significantly reduced growth in vitro as well as reduced turmorigencity (13Symington B.E. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, loss of α5α1 expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells increased tumorigenicity (14Schreiner C. Fisher M. Hussein S. Juliano R.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1738-1740PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that integrins may also play an important role in the control of gene expression. Exposure of rabbit synovial fibroblasts to fibronectin fragments or anti-FN receptor antibody induces the expression of metalloproteinase, stromelysin, and a 92-kDa gelatinase (15Werb Z. Tremble P.M.

Overexpression of α5α1 in human colon carcinoma HT29 cells induces the transcription of growth arrest-specific gene 1 (GAS-1) and blocks the transcription of immediate early genes c-FOS, c-JUN, andJUN-B (19Varner J.A. Emerson D.A. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 725-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Treatment of non-transformed FA-K562 cells overexpressing α5α1 integrin with a synthetic peptide ligand results in an increase in CDC-2-dependent kinase activity (20Symington B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25744-25747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Symington B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Induction of cell cycle progression by disruption of ligation indicates that the growth inhibitory function of α5α1 integrin may act through suppression of cell cycle progression. However, the signals and their subsequent effects on control of cell cycle progression resulting from disruption of α5α1 ligation have not been determined. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) complexed to regulatory cyclin subunits are key regulators of the cell cycle. Important cyclin-CDK complexes in mammalian cells are cyclin D-CDK4/CDK6, cyclin E-CDK2, and cyclin A-CDK2, acting primarily in G1 phase, the G1/S transition, and S phase, respectively (22Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 23Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 24Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). CDK activity can be regulated by changes in expression of cyclins and CDKs and by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. In addition, CDK activity can be regulated by CDK inhibitors (i.e. p21 and p27) (25El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Adhesion to substratum is required for cell cycle progression through G1 and into S phase in non-transformed fibroblasts. Adhesion-dependent cell cycle progression has been linked to the expression of cyclin D, cyclin A, and activation of cyclin E-CDK2 kinase (33Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 34Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K.

Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion is largely mediated by the interaction of ECM proteins with integrins; however, it is unclear which integrin(s) is involved and how cell cycle progression is altered by specific integrins. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases activated by various extracellular signals (36Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MAP kinase activation is necessary for the induction of DNA synthesis by growth factors in fibroblasts (38Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 39Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated cell adhesion can regulate MAP kinase activity (10Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of the activation of MAP kinase pathway to DNA synthesis mediated by modulation of integrin/ECM interaction has not yet been defined. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that treatment of HT1080 cells with anti-human integrin α5 subunit mAb or FN mAb stimulated DNA synthesis after cells were released from quiescence (40Wang D. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that ligation of some integrins may promote cell cycle progression while others, such as α5α1, may inhibit cell cycle progression; however, the mechanism by which α5 mAb stimulates DNA synthesis is unclear. We now show that increased DNA synthesis and CDK2 activity stimulated by disruption of α5α1 ligation to FN is the result of an increase in expression of CDK2 and cyclin A. In addition, α5 mAb also stimulated CDK4 expression and promoted pRb phosphorylation. Disruption of α5α1/FN ligation activated MAP kinase activity. This stimulation is essential for α5 mAb-induced DNA synthesis and CDK activity. Therefore, this is the first report demonstrating that disruption of the interaction between FN and α5α1integrin by α5 mAb stimulated expression of CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activity in a MAP kinase-dependent manner and indicates that FN/α5α1 integrin interactions may suppress cell cycle progression by maintaining low levels of CDK4 and CDK2 activity through repression of MAP kinase activity. The FET human colon carcinoma cell line was originally established in vitro from a primary human colon tumor (41Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in a chemically defined McCoy's 5A serum-free medium supplemented with growth factors as described previously (40Wang D. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To study the effect of α5 mAb on DNA synthesis after release from quiescence, cells were cultured to confluence in serum-free medium and then rendered quiescent by growth factor and nutrient deprivation as described previously (42Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Release from quiescence was achieved by addition of fresh supplemental McCoy's 5A medium (SM). Anti-α2, -α4, -α5, and FN antibodies and mouse IgG were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. Fab fragments were prepared from the same α5 mAb utilized throughout this study by proteolytic digestion using a kit from Pierce. Removal of Fc fragment or undigested IgG was accomplished by a protein A column. The purity of Fab fragments was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Anti-CDK2, CDK4, cyclin A, cyclin E, p21, p27, pRb, phospho-JNK kinase, goat anti-rabbit, and goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 2, phospho-Erk1 kinase, phospho-p38 antibodies, and MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cells were inoculated into 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well, grown to confluence, and rendered quiescent as described above. Fresh SM medium was used to release cells from quiescence. Various concentrations and types of antibodies were added to cells after release from quiescence for different periods as indicated in specific experiments. [3H]Thymidine (7 μCi) (Amersham Corp.) was added into triplicate wells. DNA was then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid after 1 h, and [3H]thymidine was determined as described previously (40Wang D. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Growth-arrested cells were treated with α5 mAb in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of PD98059 to determine the effect of the inhibitor on α5 mAb-induced DNA synthesis. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured at 22 h after release from arrest as described above. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8) containing 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and quantitated by Bio-Rad protein assay. Fifty μg of total protein was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corp.). The membrane was incubated in blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dried milk and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature followed by 1 h of incubation with primary antibody and 1 h of incubation with secondary antibody. Protein was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). Phosphorylation of Erk was assessed using an antiserum that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Erk1 and -2. Total protein (200 μg) was precipitated with different antibodies as indicated in specific experiments for immunoprecipitation. Immunocomplexes were absorbed by protein A-agarose for 1–2 h, subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with various antibodies as described in specific experiments. Cell lysates were prepared as described above, 50 μg of total protein was exposed to anti-CDK2, anti-cyclin A, or anti-cyclin E antibodies for 2–3 h by agitation followed by incubation with protein A- or G-agarose for 1–2 h. Beads were then washed 3 times with lysis buffer followed by 3 washes with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 4 mmMgCl2) and resuspended in 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), 1.6 μg of histone H1 (Sigma), and 2 μl of 2 × kinase buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by addition of 12 μl of 2 × loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris at pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol). The phosphorylated histone H1 were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Previously we demonstrated that human colon carcinoma FET cells express cell surface α5α1 integrin as well as fibronectin (41Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine whether FN/α5α1 integrin ligation contributed to the control of DNA synthesis, FET cells were rendered quiescent by growth factor and nutrient deprivation and then released with fresh SM medium in the presence of anti-human integrin α5 subunit mAb for 8, 12, 18, 22, 24, and 26 h. Addition of fresh nutrients (SM medium) stimulated cells to re-enter the cell cycle as evidenced by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (Fig.1). DNA synthesis peaked at 20–24 h after stimulation. Addition of α5 mAb in addition to nutrients resulted in a 2-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation over cells treated with nutrients alone at the antibody concentration employed for this experiment. Thus, disruption of α5α1 ligation to endogenous fibronectin produced by FET cells resulted in the stimulation of DNA synthesis and implies that α5α1 integrin interactions with fibronectin act as an impediment to DNA synthesis by human colon carcinoma FET cells. These data are consistent with previous results showing that disruption of α5α1-fibronectin ligation stimulates DNA synthesis by quiescent HT 1080 cells (40Wang D. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The α4α1 integrin is a fibronectin receptor that has been shown to be involved in modulation α5α1 control of collagenase gene expression (43Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Since FET cells express cell surface α4α1 protein (data not shown), it was important to know whether disruption of ligation of α4α1 to fibronectin would also affect DNA synthesis in FET cells. Quiescent FET cells were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by treatment with nutrients in addition to antibodies to the α4 integrin subunit, the α5 subunit, or the α4 subunit together with α5 subunit. As shown in Fig. 2 A, α4 mAb had no effect on DNA synthesis, whereas α5 mAb enhanced DNA synthesis approximately 2-fold at the antibody concentration employed. Cells treated with both α4 and α5 mAb showed the same level of enhanced DNA synthesis as cells treated with α5 mAb alone. Addition of a monoclonal antibody to human integrin α2 subunit or a mouse IgG control antibody did not enhance DNA synthesis. These results demonstrated that α2α1 and α4α1integrins do not control DNA synthesis in FET cells and that the stimulation of DNA synthesis was specific to α5 mAb. When quiescent FET cells were treated with various concentrations of α5 mAb in addition to fresh medium, there was a dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into cells (Fig. 2 B). The highest concentration of α5 mAb employed resulted in a 3-fold increase in DNA synthesis. Treatment of FET cells with different concentrations of FN mAb also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 C). Fig. 2 Dshows that treatment of cells with a Fab fragment prepared from the same α5 mAb utilized throughout this study also generated a 2-fold increase in DNA synthesis. Since there were no increases in DNA synthesis when quiescent cells were plated on FN-coated plates (data not shown) and since anti-FN antibody had a similar effect on DNA synthesis as α5 mAb, it appears that this stimulation was not simply due to the binding of the α5 mAb to α5α1 integrin but was due to the disruption of binding by endogenously produced FN from FET cells to the α5α1 integrin. Antibody treatment was delayed until various times after release of quiescent FET cells with fresh medium, and DNA synthesis was measured at 22 h after initial stimulation with medium for each antibody treatment to identify at which point in the cell cycle α5 mAb exerts its effects after stimulation to re-enter the cell cycle. There was a gradual loss of the ability of α5 mAb to stimulate DNA synthesis when the antibody treatment was delayed 4–12 h after nutrient release. Addition after 12 h resulted in the complete loss of its stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis (Fig. 3). These results indicate that cells were only sensitive to α5 mAb during early G1. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by disruption of α5α1/FN ligation by α5 mAb was most effective only when antibody was added in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3). Therefore, we hypothesized that α5 mAb might alter the phosphorylation of pRb which takes place at the restriction point in G1 as a result of induction of cyclin-dependent kinase components in early G1. Western blots of cell lysates derived from α5 mAb-treated or untreated cells were probed with an antibody to pRb, and the hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb were distinguished by their respective mobilities on SDS-PAGE. Fig.4 A shows that both forms of pRb were low in quiescent FET cells and increased in cells released with fresh medium. However, the hypophosphorylated form of pRb was decreased in the cells released with fresh medium in the presence of α5 mAb for 6, 9, 12, and 16 h. These results indicate that effects of perturbation of the interactions between α5α1 integrin and fibronectin on the cell cycle are associated with the modulation of phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. It has been shown that CDK4/CDK6 which complexes with D-type cyclins is capable of phosphorylating pRb (44Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether changes in phosphorylation of pRb were associated with changes in expression levels of CDK4 in cells treated with α5 mAb. Fig. 4 B shows that protein levels of CDK4 in cells released with fresh medium plus α5 mAb were higher than those of cells released with fresh medium alone. Cyclin D1 protein was slightly increased by α5 mAb treatment (Data not shown). The results indicate that disruption of the interaction of α5α1 integrin with fibronectin increased the expression of CDK4 and, consequently, decreased levels of the hypophosphorylated form of pRb. Progression of cells through the cell cycle requires sequential assembly and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (20Symington B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25744-25747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin E associates with CDK2 to form complexes that control G1 phase progression and G1-S transition (24Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The kinetics of induction of kinase activity were determined to ascertain whether α5mAb treatment stimulated cyclin E-associated kinase as a function of cell cycle progression. Cell lysates were prepared from quiescent cells that were stimulated to reenter the cell cycle with fresh medium in the presence or absence of α5 mAb and immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin E antibody. The resultant immunocomplexes were assayed for kinase activity using histone H1 as a substrate. When cells were released with fresh medium in the presence of α5 mAb, cyclin E-associated kinase activity was increased at 6, 9, and 12 h but then, as expected, declined at 16 and 22 h when cyclin A kinase activity became more prominent (Fig.5, A and B). Thus, treatment with α5 mAb stimulated cyclin E-associated kinase activity during G1 prior to S phase entry. Since the changes in kinase activity were expected to result from changes in CDK2 complex formation, we compared the expression levels of cell cycle components and their complex formation in lysates from cells treated with and without α5 mAb treatment. α5 mAb treatment had no effect on the expression of cyclin E (Fig.6 and Fig.7 B) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 but did increase the expression of CDK2 at 12 h (data not shown) and 22 h (Fig. 6) after cells were released from quiescence. The increased levels of CDK2 resulted in increased levels of cyclin E-associated CDK2 at 12 h after release (Fig. 7 B). As expected, α5 mAb had no effect on cyclin E-CDK2 complex formation at 22 h. Since there were no changes in CDK2 complexed to p21 (data not shown) and p27 (Fig. 7 A), the increased cyclin E-associated kinase activity was primarily due to increased levels of cyclin E complex formation with CDK2.Figure 6Effect of α5 mAb treatment on CDK2 and cyclin A protein expression. Quiescent (QUI) FET cells were treated with fresh medium alone or with a 1:100 dilution of α5 mAb for 22 h after release. 50 μg of total cell protein were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against cyclin A, cyclin E, and CDK2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Effect of α5 mAb treatment on the formation of CDK2 complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2066651251,"To understand smooth muscle-specific gene expression, we have focused our studies on the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMHC) gene, a smooth muscle-specific marker. In this study, we demonstrate that the SMHC promoter region (-1594 to -1462 base pairs) containing the A/T-rich element can activate the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter in smooth muscle cells, but not in fibroblasts. Mutations of this A/T-rich element decreased SMHC promoter activity significantly. Both gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting revealed that this region binds to specific protein complexes from smooth muscle nuclear extracts, whereas nuclear extracts from skeletal muscle and fibroblasts produced a different binding pattern. We also demonstrate that the protein complex obtained from smooth muscle nuclear extract reacts with MEF2B-specific antibody, but not with antibodies specific to MEF2A, MEF2C, or MEF2D, suggesting that only MEF2B protein binds to the A/T-rich element. Furthermore, MEF2B overexpression in smooth muscle cells up-regulated the SMHC promoter, suggesting that MEF2B is important for SMHC gene regulation. This is the first report demonstrating a role for MEF2 factors in smooth muscle-specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2115828574,"To examine the role of glutamatergic signaling in the function of pancreatic islets, we have characterized a high affinity glutamate/aspartate uptake system in this tissue. The islet [3H]glutamate uptake activity was Na+-dependent, and it was blocked byl-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, a blocker of neuronal and glial glutamate transporters. Islet glutamate transport activity exhibited a V max of 8.48 ± 1.47 fmol/min/islet (n = 4), which corresponds to 102.2 ± 17.7 pmol/min/mg islet protein. The apparent K m of islet glutamate transport activity depended on the glucose concentration used in the assay. In the presence of glucose concentrations that do not stimulate insulin secretion (2.8 mm), the apparent K m was 34.7 ± 7.8 μm (n = 3). However, in high glucose (16.7 mm) the apparent K m increased to 112.7 ± 16.5 μm (n = 3) with little or no change in V max. Like most known plasma membrane glutamate transporters, islet glutamate transporters also transported d-aspartate. Anti-d-aspartate immunoreactivity showed that the islet glutamate/aspartate transport activity was localized to the non-β cell islet mantle. In perifusion experiments with isolated islets in the absence of exogenous amino acids,l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid in the presence of 8.3 mm glucose potentiated insulin secretion 23.3 ± 2.3% (n = 3) compared with 8.3 mm glucose alone. This effect was abolished in the presence of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. Furthermore, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione alone inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets by 15.9 ± 5.9% (n = 3). Taken together these data suggest that a high affinity glutamate transport system exists in pancreatic islets and that this system contributes to a glutamatergic signaling pathway that can modulate glucose-inducible insulin secretion.

Although the role of glutamate as a signaling molecule is well established in the central nervous system, a similar role in the periphery has only recently been suggested. We (1Weaver C.D. Yao T.L.

These miniature organs, found dispersed throughout the exocrine pancreas, are composed of four major cell types as follows: the insulin-secreting β cell, the glucagon-secreting α cell, the pancreatic polypeptide-secreting PP cell, and the somatostatin-secreting δ cell. The electrically excitable β cells are stimulated to secrete insulin in response to changes in serum glucose concentrations. Secretion of insulin, and the three other major peptide hormones found in islets, is also believed to be affected by other metabolic and neuronal signals (reviewed in Refs. 3Boyd A.E. J. Cell.

Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E551-E556PubMed Google Scholar). We have localized AMPA-type glutamate receptors to β, α, and PP cells and kainate receptors in α cells using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology (1Weaver C.D. Yao T.L. Powers A.C. Verdoorn T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12977-12984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of glutamatergic signaling in islet physiology, we examined islets for the presence of a high affinity uptake system similar to those described in the central nervous system. Glutamate transporters in the central nervous system allow glutamate to act as a specific signaling molecule despite its relatively high concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid because they reduce the concentration of glutamate in the vicinity of receptors. Earlier studies have suggested that islets do not possess a high capacity for glutamate uptake and utilization; however, these studies were focused on the possible role of glutamate as a carbon source or as a fuel secretagogue (8Sehlin J. Hormones. 1972; 3: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The millimolar concentrations of glutamate used in these studies did not adequately address the possibility of a high affinity glutamate uptake system in islets, the presence of which might serve to support a role for glutamate receptors in islet signal transduction. By using a [3H]glutamate uptake assay, we detected glutamate transport activity in isolated rat pancreatic islets. The uptake observed in islets had properties similar to those of central nervous system transporters. It had high affinity for glutamate, was Na+-dependent, and was blocked byl-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (l-trans-PDC), a compound that blocks neuronal and glial transporters. Furthermore, the apparent K m of islet glutamate uptake was markedly increased by increasing glucose concentrations. Visualization of d-aspartate uptake with anti-d-aspartate antibodies showed that the transporter activity was located in the α cell-rich islet mantle. The blockade of glutamate transport in isolated islets byl-trans-PDC potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas blockade of AMPA receptors with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) resulted in inhibition of insulin secretion. These observations indicate that glutamate transporters are important components of a glutamatergic signaling system within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans.

Poly(A)qua/Mount was purchased from Polysciences. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or higher. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan. Islets were isolated and cultured by a modification of the method described (9Hegre O.D. Marshall S. Schulte B.A. Hickey G.E. Williams F. Sorenson R.L. Serie J.R. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Pancreata were harvested from 5 to 10, 4- or 5-day-old neonatal rat pups and placed in 4 ml of Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (culture medium). The pancreata were diced with fine iris scissors until the pieces were approximately 0.5 mm3. During the process of dicing, the pieces of pancreas were washed 5 times with fresh culture medium. Diced pancreas tissue was placed in 100-mm diameter polystyrene culture dishes at a density of approximately three diced pancreata per dish in 6 ml of culture medium. The pieces were incubated overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The following day, the medium was removed from the pancreas explants and replaced with fresh culture medium. The explants were then incubated for 3 days in the 5% CO2 incubator after which time the medium was changed again. Two days following the last medium change the islet explants were dislodged from the bottom of the polystyrene dishes with gentle trituration and transferred to a 50-ml polypropylene conical tube. The explants were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 2 min in a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge. The explant pellet was then resuspended in 5 ml of fresh culture medium. The resuspended islet pellet was layered onto a Percoll gradient prepared as described (10Brunstedt J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1980; 6: 87-89Google Scholar) with the exception that the Percoll solutions were made up in culture medium. The gradients were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge. The islets were harvested from the 1.060/1.082 g/ml Percoll interface, and the remaining acinar tissue was found at the medium 1.060 g/ml Percoll interface. Five ml of culture medium was added to the harvested islets in a 15-ml conical tube, and the sample was mixed by inversion. The islets were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 3 min in a clinical centrifuge and washed with an additional 10 ml of culture medium. The islets were pelleted as above and resuspended in culture medium. The islets were plated at a density of approximately 1000–2000 islets per 100-mm diameter polystyrene culture dish in 6 ml of culture medium per dish and subsequently cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator overnight at 37 °C. The following day the islets were harvested from the culture dish using a 5-ml polystyrene pipette leaving behind the remainder of the fibroblasts adhering to the culture dish. The islets were pelleted as described above and resuspended in 6 ml of culture medium where 25% (v/v) horse serum was used in place of 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The islets were incubated overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator and used for l-glutamate/d-aspartate uptake or insulin release assays the next day. Islets isolated as described above were hand counted using a Gilson P-10 micropipetor and an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope. Thirty to fifty islets were transferred to 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μl of a buffer consisting of (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 2.2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3 (uptake buffer), containing 11.2 mm glucose. In some studies choline was used in place of Na+ and gluconate was used in place of Cl− in the uptake buffer. After harvest 1 ml of uptake buffer was added to the tubes containing the islets. The islets were pelleted in a swinging bucket microcentrifuge at 500 × g for 15 s. The buffer was removed by careful aspiration, and the islets were resuspended in 150 μl of uptake buffer containing varying glucose concentrations and bicuculline, as appropriate, at either 37 or 0 °C. The islets were then incubated for 5 min at either 37 °C or on ice. Following the preincubation, 150 μl of uptake buffer was added containing the appropriate glucose concentration, bicuculline (where appropriate), and twice the desired final concentration ofl-[3H]glutamate,d-[3H]aspartate, l-cystine, andl-trans-PDC, as appropriate. Samples were incubated for 5–9 min at either 37 °C or on ice. The uptake assay was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer. The islets were pelleted by centrifugation as described above. The supernatant solution was aspirated, and the islets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer. This wash procedure was repeated a total of three times. After the final wash, the islets were lysed in 100 μl of 0.5 m NaOH for 5 min with occasional vortexing. The samples were centrifuged as above and then transferred to a vial containing 3 ml of aqueous scintillation mixture, mixed by inversion, and counted using a Packard model 1600 TR liquid scintillation counter. Values obtained from the scintillation counter were converted into uptake activity units using l-[3H]glutamate or d-[3H]aspartate standards. For calculation of K m and V max, values obtained at 0 °C were treated as a blank and subtracted from the values obtained at 37 °C. Uptake data were analyzed using Igor (Wavemetrics), Excel (Microsoft), and Instat (GraphPad Software). Statistical comparisons were paired two-tailed t tests.l-trans-PDC inhibition curves were fit, andl-trans-PDC IC50 was calculated using the logistic equation. Figures were constructed using Igor. Two to five hundred islets were placed in a 50-μl perifusion chamber. The islets were washed for 30 min at a flow rate of 100 μl/min with oxygenated uptake buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose at 37 °C. Following the wash the islets were perifused for 15 min at the same flow rate and temperature with uptake buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose (control) or uptake buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose and 100 μmd-aspartate. The islets were washed for 15 min at 200 μl/min with ice-cold uptake buffer. The islets were then fixed at room temperature in the chamber by perifusion with uptake buffer containing 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde at 200 μl/min for 5 min. The perifusion was halted, and the islets were incubated for 1 h in the fixative at room temperature. At the end of the incubation the chambers were disassembled, and the frits with fixed islets attached were removed. The islet-bearing frits were transferred to 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes containing uptake buffer with 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 0.1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The frits were then washed 3 times for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) composed of (in mm) 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 10.1 Na2HPO4, 1.5 KH2PO4, and 2 times for 30 min in PBS containing 30% (w/v) sucrose. The sucrose equilibrated islet-containing frits were placed face down in a mold containing tissue freezing medium (OCT compound) and frozen on dry ice. Five-μm sections were cut and thaw-mounted onto charge slides. The sections were allowed to dry for 10 min and were rehydrated in PBS. Sections were permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and blocked for 1 h in 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (for the anti-d-aspartate antibody) or 5% (v/v) normal donkey serum (for the anti-glucagon antibody) in PBS. The blocked sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:250 dilution of anti-glucagon antibody or a 1:1000 dilution of anti-d-aspartate antibody. The anti-d-aspartate antibody was raised as described (11Storm-Mathisen J. Leknes A.K. Bore A. Vaaland J.L. Edminson P. Haug F.M.S. Ottersen O.P. Nature. 1983; 301: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) and thoroughly tested as described (12Gundersen V. Danbolt N.C. Ottersen P.O. Storm-Mathisen J. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The antibodies were diluted in PBS plus 1% (v/v) normal goat serum (for the anti-d-aspartate antibody) or 1% (v/v) normal donkey serum (for the anti-glucagon antibody) and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Following incubation the sections were washed 1 time for 10 min in PBS plus 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2 times for 10 min/wash in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) composed of (in mm) 25 Tris, pH 8.0, 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl plus 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. For detection of tissue-bound antibody, washed sections were incubated for 1–3 h at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (for the anti-d-aspartate antibody) or a 1:500 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig antibody (for the anti-glucagon antibody) diluted in TBS plus 1% (v/v) normal goat serum or 1% (v/v) normal donkey serum, respectively, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Following incubation slides were washed 3 times for 10 min/wash in TBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 time for 5 min with a buffer containing (in mm) 100 Tris, pH 9.5, 100 NaCl, 5 MgCl2 (alkaline phosphatase buffer) plus 0.1 mmlevamisole. Immunoreactivity was visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in alkaline phosphatase buffer containing 0.1 mm levamisole. Slides were mounted with Poly(A)qua/Mount. Photomicrographs were taken using a Leica Laborlux S microscope equipped with a Wild MPS52 camera attachment, a Wild MPS46 photoautomat, and Kodak T max 100 film. Prints were produced on Ilford Multigrade IV RC Deluxe paper. 100 islets per experimental condition were placed in a 50-μl perifusion chamber. The islets were perifused for 30 min at a flow rate of 100 μl/min at 37 °C with a buffer containing (in mm) 128 NaCl, 1.19 MgSO4, 18 NaHCO3, 2.54 CaCl2, 1.19 KH2PO4, 4.74 KCl, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (perifusion buffer) plus 2.8 mm glucose (bubbled for 1 h prior to perifusion with 95% O2/5% CO2). Following this wash, the perifusion was stopped for 5 min. At the end of the 5 min, a fraction was collected by perifusing the islets at 1 ml/min for 30 s. Perifusion was allowed to continue at 100 μl/min for 2.5 min after which the flow was stopped for an additional 5 min. Another fraction was collected as above. The islets were then perifused for 2.5 min at 100 μl/min with perifusion buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose or perifusion buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose plus either 500 μml-trans-PDC, 10 μm CNQX, or bothl-trans-PDC, and CNQX. Flow was stopped and fractions were collected as above. Following this treatment, the islets were perifused for 2.5 min at 100 μl/min with perifusion buffer containing 8.3 mm glucose or perifusion buffer containing 8.3 mm glucose plus eitherl-trans-PDC, CNQX, or bothl-trans-PDC and CNQX. Flow was stopped and fractions were collected as above. Insulin concentrations in the perifusate were determined by a core facility using the Linco insulin radioimmunoassay with appropriate standards. Data were analyzed using Instat and Excel. Statistical comparisons are from paired two-tailedt tests. We have identified a high affinity glutamate uptake system in isolated, intact pancreatic islets using a [3H]glutamate uptake assay. Islet glutamate uptake exhibited saturable kinetics (Fig.1) and an affinity for [3H]glutamate that was nearly identical to glutamate transporter activities observed in the central nervous system. Lineweaver-Burk replots of glutamate uptake activity revealed an apparent K m of 34.7 ± 7.8 μm(n = 3) in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose. This [3H]glutamate uptake activity displayed aV max of 8.48 ± 1.47 fmol/min/islet (corresponding to 102.2 ± 17.7 pmol/min/mg islet protein) (n = 4). Islet glutamate uptake activity showed other properties similar to central nervous system glutamate transport activities. In particular, islet [3H]glutamate uptake activity was dependent on temperature. Uptake at 0 °C averaged only 13.1 ± 4.1% (n = 3) of that measured at 37 °C. Islet [3H]glutamate uptake was also strongly dependent on the presence of Na+ in the uptake buffer. In experiments where Na+ was replaced with choline, the glutamate uptake activity was 28.7 ± 3.0% (n = 3) that measured in the presence of normal external Na+. A Na+-independent, Cl−-dependent glutamate transport activity has been reported in the periphery (13Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2256-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in neurons (15Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This activity, designated system Xc−, is inhibited by excess cystine. Islet glutamate uptake decreased only modestly (6.1%,n = 2) when Cl− was replaced by gluconate in the uptake assay buffer. However, the addition of 500 μm cystine in Na+-free conditions further decreased [3H]glutamate activity to 11.3% of control. Since system Xc− is believed to be primarily involved in the uptake of cystine, we focused our study on the more prominent Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake activity in islets. To determine which islet cell types were responsible for the observed glutamate uptake activity, we examined transport ofd-aspartate. As in the case of most other known plasma membrane glutamate transporters, isletd-[3H]aspartate transport was quite similar to l-[3H]glutamate transport for bothK m and V max (Fig.2).d-[3H]Aspartate uptake was also sensitive to temperature and to the removal of external Na+ (Fig. 2,inset). The similarities betweenl-[3H]glutamate andd-[3H]aspartate uptake suggested that both were transported by the same transporter proteins and therebyd-aspartate uptake offered a way to determine which islet cells harbored glutamate transporters. In these experiments islets were incubated in the presence and absence of 100 μmd-aspartate and fixed with glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde to covalently bind amino acids in a form accessible for immunostaining. This technique was first demonstrated as indicated in Ref. 11Storm-Mathisen J. Leknes A.K. Bore A. Vaaland J.L. Edminson P. Haug F.M.S. Ottersen O.P. Nature. 1983; 301: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, and the degree of retention of labeledl-glutamate and d-aspartate by different fixatives was determined (16Storm-Mathisen J. Ottersen O.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1733-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Samples were stained with the selectived-aspartate antibodies (12Gundersen V. Danbolt N.C. Ottersen P.O. Storm-Mathisen J. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Gundersen V. Shupliakov O. Brodin L. Ottersen O.P. StormMathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4417-4428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with anti-peptide hormone antibodies for the identification of the cell types that concentrated d-aspartate. As shown in Fig.3 A, anti-d-aspartate immunoreactivity was restricted to the cells of the islet mantle which, in our preparation, are primarily glucagon-containing α cells (Fig. 3 B). The islet mantle may also contain a small percentage of δ and PP cells (data not shown), and thus our data cannot exclude the presence ofd-aspartate uptake activity in these cell types. Anti-d-aspartate staining was not observed in islets that had not been incubated in the presence of d-aspartate (Fig.3 C).Figure 3Islet d-aspartate (l-glutamate) uptake is localized to the cells of the islet mantle. Shown are light micrographs of 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde-fixed, isolated islet sections.A, islet incubated with 100 μmd-aspartate prior to fixation and probed with anti-d-aspartate antibody.

Scale bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because islets are glucose-sensitive organs, we have also investigated the effect of d-glucose on [3H]glutamate uptake in islets. We found that islet glutamate uptake activity was significantly inhibited (32.0 ± 3.8%, n = 5,p = 0.0013) in the presence of a glucose concentration that stimulates insulin secretion (16.7 mmd-glucose) compared with uptake in lowd-glucose (2.8 mm) (Fig.4 A). The inhibitory effect of glucose on glutamate transport was not due to an increase in the osmolarity of the uptake buffer since non-metabolizablel-glucose (16.7 mm) failed to result in an inhibition of glutamate uptake (102.06 ± 4.2% of control) (Fig.4 A). Replots of the uptake data revealed that inhibition byd-glucose was the result of a change in the apparentK m for glutamate and not a change in theV max (Fig. 4 B). At low glucose, islet glutamate uptake had an apparent K m of 34.7 ± 7.8 μm (n = 3). However, in the presence of 16.7 mmd-glucose (Fig. 4 B) the apparent K m for glutamate shifted to 112.7 ± 16.5 μm (n = 3). These data are consistent with a competitive mode of inhibition byd-glucose at a concentration that stimulates insulin secretion. It has been suggested that down-regulation of glucagon secretion in α cells exposed to high glucose may be mediated by GABAAreceptors expressed in these cells (18Rorsman P. Berggren P.-O. Bokvist K.

Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proposed source of GABA is β cells, which may coordinately release it with insulin (20Gerber J.C. Hare T.A. Brain Res. Bull. 1980; 5: 341-346Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since glutamate/aspartate uptake activity was predominantly in α cells, we tested whether glucose inhibition of glutamate transport might be mediated through this mechanism. To do this we repeated the uptake experiments with 2.8 and 16.7 mmd-glucose in the presence of the GABA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. However, the degree of inhibition (31.7 ± 1.7%,n = 3) was the same as that measured in the absence of bicuculline (Fig. 4 A). The addition of 50 μmbicuculline alone had no effect on [3H]glutamate uptake (102.7 ± 11.2% of uptake in the absence of bicuculline,n = 3). Previously, Bertrand et al. (5Bertrand G. Gross R. Puech R. Loubatières-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Bertrand G. Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E551-E556PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that AMPA receptor agonists potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion in a perfused pancreas preparation (5Bertrand G.

Bockaert J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E551-E556PubMed Google Scholar). To identify potential roles of glutamate transporters in islets, we examined the effects of glutamate transport inhibition on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.l-trans-PDC is an inhibitor of glutamate transport in the central nervous system (21Price C.J. Raymond L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1665-1671PubMed Google Scholar) and showed an IC50 of 129.2 μm against islet [3H]glutamate transport. In the presence of 35 μm glutamate the maximum amount of inhibition we observed in islets was 66.0% with 2 mml-trans-PDC. The average inhibition of glutamate transport (35 μm) was 55.0 ± 3.9% (n = 4) in the presence of 500 μml-trans-PDC (Fig.5 A). This concentration ofl-trans-PDC has been shown to potentiate glutamate receptor activity in hippocampal CA1 neurons (22Isaacson J.S. Nicoll R.A. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows the results from a representative experiment where isolated islets, in the absence of exogenous amino acids, were exposed to 2.8 and 8.3 mmd-glucose in the absence and presence of either 500 μml-trans-PDC, the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (10 μm), or both l-trans-PDC and CNQX. We have previously demonstrated that 10 μm CNQX is sufficient"

The Escherichia coli ribosomal protein, L7/L12, is the most extensively investigated representative of the small, four-copy, dimeric acidic proteins that are found in large ribosomal subunits of all organisms and exist as a conserved quaternary structural element in which two dimers are integrated into the ribosome through binding to a common anchoring protein (1Uchiumi T.

One or both of the L7/L12 dimers form a conspicuous morphological feature on the ribosome known in E. coli as the L7/L12 stalk (4Strycharz W.A. Nomura M. Lake J.A. J. Mol.

The L7/L12 polypeptide is composed of two distinct organized structural domains linked by a flexible hinge (6Leijonmarck M. Pettersson I. Liljas A. Balaban M. Sussman J.L. Traub W. Yonath A.

This was consistent with earlier demonstrations that the N-terminal domain was responsible for binding of the full-length L7/L12 to L10 and to the ribosome (9Koteliansky V.E. Domogatsky S.P.

Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Different studies indicated that the presence of one L7/L12 dimer on the body of the 50 S particle in an extended conformation directed toward the central protuberance (22Traut R.R. Lambert J.M.

Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986: 309-325Google Scholar). Additional evidence that a C-terminal domain can occupy a location not only extended across the body of the ribosome but also near the base of the stalk came from cross-linking between a predetermined location in the C-terminal domain, Cys-89, and Cys-70 of L10 (24Zecherle G.N.

A different heterobifunctional reagent, APDP 1The abbreviations used are: APDP,N-[4-(p-azidosalicylamido)-butyl]-3-(2′pyridyldithio)propionamide; EF-G, elongation factor G; GMP-P(NH)P, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. showed a cross-link between Cys-89 and L11 and also with L10 in a lesser extent near the EF-G binding site near the base of the stalk (28Zecherle G.N. Oleinikov A. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9526-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The site-specific cross-linking experiments led to the proposal of a possible “bent” conformation for one of the dimers in which the C-terminal domain could lie on the body of the subunit near the N-terminal domain at the base of the stalk. We asked the question whether there was a preferred surface of the C-terminal domain that made these contacts and designed cysteine probe sites on other faces of the C-terminal domain. In addition we investigated whether any protein other than those at the base of the stalk made contact with the C-terminal domain. Previous experiments with 2-iminothiolane showed contact between an undefined lysine of L7/L12 with proteins L2 and L5 (22Traut R.R. Lambert J.M. Kenny J.W. J. Biol.

The present approach permits us to define which domain makes these distant contacts. The effect of elongation factors on the pattern of cross-linking was also examined. APDP and IodobeadsTM were products of Pierce.125I was procured from Amersham Life Science, Inc. All other chemicals were of reagent grade of high purity. Kirromycin was a gift from G. Brocades, Delft, The Netherlands. Ribosomes were prepared from midlog culture of E. coli MRE600 as described earlier (30Lambert J.M. Traut R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 451-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ribosomes used in these experiments were more than 90% tight couple population as determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Core ribosomes completely lacking L7/L12 (P0 cores) protein were prepared from 70 S ribosomes following the method of Ref. 5Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar with modifications as described (21Tokimatsu H. Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). They were stored in aliquots at −86 °C. Wild type L7/L12 lacks cysteine. The preparation of the Cys-89, Cys-63, Cys-33 variants was as described previously (26Oleinikov A.V. Perroud B. Wang B. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 917-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two additional amino acid substitutions, Ala-12 to Cys-12 and Ser-99 to Cys-99, were generated using the site-specific oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system from Amersham (12Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparations was estimated to be at least 95% by SDS-PAGE. The mutant proteins L7/L12[Cys12], L7/L12[Cys33], L7/L12[Cys63], L7/L12[Cys89], and L7/L12[Cys99] are designated as Cys12, Cys33, Cys63, Cys89, and Cys99. APDP was labeled with 125I using IodobeadsTM as described previously (28Zecherle G.N. Oleinikov A. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9526-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of 125I was adjusted to 10–20 Ci/mmol by adding cold sodium iodide. Radioiodinated APDP was purified by TLC on silica plates (Silica Gel 60 F254; Merck) in chloroform/benzene/ethyl acetate/acetic acid (10:10:10:1). The plate was exposed for a few seconds with Kodak X-Omat film, and the position of 125I-APDP was identified by comparing the UV quenching pattern with the radioautograph. Silica from the area containing 125I-APDP was removed from the plate and extracted with acetonitrile. The solution of radioiodinated APDP was stored at −20 °C in the dark for periods up to one month, during which time there was no detectable decomposition as judged by running analytical scale TLC followed by fluorography. The modification reactions were performed in fluorescent light as described previously (28Zecherle G.N. Oleinikov A. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9526-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations varied from 0.4 to 2 mg/ml. A 5–40-fold molar excess of125I-APDP over protein was used in different preparations. Unreacted reagent was removed by passing the reaction mixture through NAP-5 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4). Fractions (100 μl) were collected, and radioactivity and protein concentration were determined. The final specific radioactivity was very reproducible throughout all L7/L12 variants and routinely gave values above 90% of modification, assuming specific radioactivity of 125I-APDP to be the same as initial Na[125]I. Modified proteins were stored at −20 °C and used without additional treatment. The 70 S P0 core particles (1 mg, 0.37 nmol) completely lacking wild type L7/L12, as judged by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were first incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mm NH4Cl,10 mm MgCl2, and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, passed two times through Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) for the complete removal of the reducing agent, and then reconstituted individually with each of the five different radiolabeled Cys variants as described previously (28Zecherle G.N. Oleinikov A. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9526-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Excess, or unbound L7/L12 was removed by centrifugation of the particles through a 10% (w/v) sucrose cushion in the same buffer (without 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 h at 58,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti65 rotor. The reconstituted ribosomal pellet was resuspended in the same buffer (without the reducing agent) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Typically, reconstituted 70 S ribosomes in different experiments had between 2.9 and 3.7 copies of125I(azidophenyl)thio-L7/L12Cys. It had been shown previously that modification with APDP had no inhibitory effect on ribosomal activity in a poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis assay in which 15–20 Phe residues/ribosome were polymerized (28Zecherle G.N. Oleinikov A. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9526-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was initiated by irradiation of the reconstituted ribosome samples kept in standard 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 4 °C for 5 min with a UV light source (Black Ray model B-100A, Fisher; UV light >300 nm). The source was mounted to provide a vertical beam of light centered over an opened sample tube at a distance of 10 cm. After the cross-linking reaction, samples were made 1% with 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to cleave the disulfide bond in the cross-link bridge. For final identification, 50 pmol of radioactive ribosomes were mixed with 125 pmol of cold ribosomes in a buffer containing 1% of 2-mercaptoethanol. The total protein was extracted with 66% acetic acid (31Hardy S.J.S. Kurland C.G. Voynow P. Mara G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and the extracted proteins were extensively dialyzed against 6% acetic acid at 4 °C and lyophilized. Samples of approximately 140 μg were dissolved in 25 μl of sample buffer containing 20 mm Bis-Tris acetate (pH 3.7), 8 m urea, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by two-dimensional acid/urea gel electrophoresis (32Knopf U.C. Sommer A. Kenny J. Traut R.R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1975; 2: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie R-250 and dried on Whatmann 3MM paper. Ribosomes containing L7/L12Cys63 modified with125I-APDP were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation before photocross-linking, after cross-linking and reduction, in the absence of elongation factors, and in the presence of EF-Tu ternary complexes containing GMP-P(NH)P or GDP·kirromycin. In these experiments, excess L7/L12 used for reconstitution was not removed. Each aliquot contained 4 A 260 units of 70 S ribosomes and 644,000 cpm of the 125I-APDP radiolabel. Centrifugation was carried out in an SW-40 rotor for 12 h at 25,000 rpm. The gradient buffer from 5–20% sucrose contained 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), and 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions (0.45 ml) were collected, and A 260 and radioactivity were determined for each. The relative amount of radiolabel attached to ribosomal particles is difficult to quantify accurately due to the presence of the preponderant fraction at the top of the gradient. Approximately 2% of the label was found in the ribosome fractions, a yield consistent with nitrene-generating cross-linking reagents (33Bayley H. Photogenerated Reagents in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1983Google Scholar). For this reason it was impossible to compare quantitatively the different variants. Stained and dried gels were exposed with high sensitivity screens of a Molecular ImagerTM System (GS-250, Bio-Rad) followed by quantitative analysis of the screen according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The images were processed and quantified using Molecular AnalystTMsoftware (Bio-Rad, Version 1.1). The exposure times were from 3 to 14 h depending on the amount of radioactivity in the gels. The instrument has a broad range of linearity, and all images were within this response range. The image size on the computer monitor was set to represent the actual size of the stained gel. Qualitative identification of cross-linked proteins was performed by superimposition of the patterns of radioactivity with a transparency of Coomassie Blue-stained gel pattern of total protein. For quantification, the positions of the all of the protein spots corresponding to the stained pattern were given elliptical outlines on the computer image. Each ellipse was centered on the most intensely stained part of each spot, and its size was set to minimize overlap with nearby proteins. The area of the ellipse for each individual protein was kept constant for that protein throughout all experiments. The quantification was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The volume analysis option of the software was used for quantification. The numbers generated by the software represent the number of counts accumulated by the irradiation-sensitive screen of the Molecular Imager in the selected, outlined areas for each protein. To determine the background, the same procedures were followed for samples identical in every way, except that they were not irradiated. Background values were 5–10% irradiated values. The intensity of labeling for each individual protein was corrected for background and plotted relative to the full scale established from the most highly labeled protein on each gel, L7/L12 itself for the Cys99, Cys89, Cys63, and Cys33 variants and L10 for the Cys 12 variant. This normalization facilitated comparison of the distribution of labeling among different proteins in different experiments. Samples of 70 S P0 cores reconstituted with radiolabeled L7/L12 Cys-variant proteins were incubated with EF-G under two different conditions. In a total volume of 100 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NH4Cl, and 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 pmol of ribosomes were incubated with 100 pmol of EF-G either in the presence of 30 mm fusidic acid and 1 mm GTP or with 1 mm GMP-P(NH)P at 0 °C for 30 min (34Bodley J.W. Weissbach H. Brot N. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For experiments with EF-Tu, samples containing 50 pmol of reconstituted 70 S ribosomes in buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, and 80 mm NH4Cl were incubated with 150 pmol of freshly prepared ternary complex (Phe-tRNA·EF-Tu·GMP-P(NH)P) (35Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) together with 14 μg of poly(U) for 30 min at 0 °C. For experiments with kirromycin, ribosomes were incubated with 150 pmol of [14C]Phe-tRNA, 1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm kirromycin, 14 μg of poly(U), and 8 μg of EF-Tu at 30 °C and then at 0 °C for 20 min as described (36Parmeggiani A. Swart G.W.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 557-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The extent of ternary complex formation was 40%, assayed by adsorption filtration through nitrocellulose filters (35Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After incubation, the samples were irradiated, and the distribution of cross-linked proteins was analyzed as described above. To measure the subunit distribution and cross-linking yield of ribosomes with bound EF-Tu, reduced samples were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described above. There are no cysteine residues in wild type L7/L12 from E. coli (37Terhorst C. Möller W. Laursen R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the locations of the five single cysteine substitutions used in the study described here in the non-staggered, parallel arrangement of the dimer (3Liljas A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 161-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Three are in the C-terminal domain, the domain required in elongation factor binding, and two are in the N-terminal domain, the domain required for dimerization and binding to the ribosome through interaction with L10. The N-terminal domain in Fig. 1 A is a simplified representation that indicates the positions of residues 12 and 33. Recent, NMR structure revealed that each monomer is a hairpin of two parallel α-helices, the dimer having a four-stranded α-helical structure (38Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Residues Cys-12 and -33 are distal and proximal to the hinge, respectively. The location of residues 63, 89, and 99 are represented in the model based on the high resolution crystallographic structure of the C-terminal domain (39Leijonmarck M. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 555-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1 B. Residue 89 is located in the turn between the αB helix and the βB sheet, residue 63 is in the turn between the βA sheet and the αA helix, and residue 99 is in the turn between the βB sheet and the αC helix. The three sites are on exposed surfaces facing in different directions. Residues 63, 89, and 99 (αCs) are 30.3, 23.9, and 5.2 Å, respectively, from residue 53 (αC), which is located at the junction of the globular head and the flexible hinge. Cys-99 is near the junction of the C-terminal domain with the hinge. Residue 63 is 13.9 Å from residue 89. UV-induced reaction between125I-APDP attached to L7/L12 and target molecules leads to disulfide-bridged cross-links. Subsequent reduction breaks the bridge, with the concomitant transfer of label to the target. The subunit specificity and UV dependence of radiolabeling was analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The samples were reduced, and the gradient contained reducing agent. Any labeling of subunits indicates transfer of radiolabel from L7/L12 to a different neighboring location. Fig.2 shows these results for L7/L12 labeled at Cys-63, the location that consistently gave the highest overall level of labeling. Panel A shows that there is radioactivity coincident with the 50 S peak and possibly with the 30 S subunit. TheA 260-absorbing material at the top of the gradient is due to free (azidophenyl)thio resulting from reaction of the photoactive moiety with H2O. Both (azidophenyl)thio and protein-bound APDP contribute to the radioactivity at the top of the gradient, the presence of which makes it difficult to estimate any label in the 30 S subunits. Panel B indicates that the labeling of the 50 S subunit was largely dependent upon irradiation. It was difficult to exclude completely background light. That the major target of labeling was the 50 S subunit is to be expected from the location of L7/L12 and, as seen later, from the fact that a major labeled species is L7/L12, itself due to transfer from one L7/L12 subunit to another (“homolabeling”). When SDS was included in the samples and gradient buffer, all radiolabel was found at the top of the gradient. There was no label coincident with the 23 and 16 S ribosomal RNA peaks. This was the case for all five variants (results not shown). Accordingly, characterization of the radiolabeled ribosomal proteins was pursued. Fig. 3 shows analysis of ribosomal proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Panel 3Ashows the stained gel of 70 S proteins. The gel system separates most 70 S ribosomal proteins with good resolution, and this is the case for the labeled proteins. Panel 3B shows the distribution and identities of radiolabeled proteins with the 125I-APDP probe attached at Cys-63, the probe location that gave maximal labeling of proteins other than L7/L12 itself. The ellipsoids indicate how the Molecular Imager analysis was conducted as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins L7/L12, L10, L11 are the major labeled proteins. Proteins L2 and L5 are labeled to a less, but clearly significant extent. In addition to 50 S proteins, 30 S ribosomal proteins S2, S3, S7, S14, and S18 are clearly labeled. Protein S4 is visible in this gel but is generally found only at a very low level and only with Cys63. Only a low level of labeling occurred in the absence of irradiation, due to difficulty in completely excluding stray light, as indicated by the sucrose gradient analysis. Only L7/L12 itself was labeled when irradiation was performed before reconstitution. The result rules out labeling by disulfide interchange. When modified, L7/L12 was irradiated after mixing with 30 S subunits, and a low level of S2 labeling occurred in addition to the homolabeling. Panels C, D, E, and F show the patterns of labeling for variants Cys89, Cys99, Cys12 and Cys33, respectively. The patterns for the C-terminal variants Cys89 and Cys99 are qualitatively similar to Cys63. The patterns for the N-terminal variants Cys12 and Cys33 are notably different. Labeling is confined to the L7/L12, L10, L11 regions, and there is no labeling of 30 S subunit proteins. Equal amounts of total ribosomal protein from ribosomes reconstituted with the different C-terminal domain variants radiolabeled with the same specific activity were analyzed. When homolabeling was excluded there were differences in the overall yield of labeling of target proteins for the three variants. Cys63 gave the highest yield, and Cys99 gave the lowest. The Molecular Imager was programmed to quantify the radiolabel present in each protein spot relative to the total detected on the gel. The results for all five variants are shown in Fig.4. The height of the barsprovides a linear depiction of the relative distribution of the extent of labeling among the total proteins. The 10 proteins listed qualitatively from the gels shown in Fig. 3 appear as barsof different heights. For all of the variants except Cys12, L7/L12 itself most heavily labeled species; therefore, the software was programmed to normalize each protein to L7/L12, taken as 1 in thebar graph. The extent of homolabeling (transfer of label to L7/L12 itself) was compared for each variant in the free and ribosome-bound state. Homolabeling in solution for the two N-terminal domain variants was much greater than for the C-terminal domain variants, with Cys63 distinctly lower than Cys89 and Cys99. Ribosome binding had no effect on the C-terminal domain sites but greatly lowered the Cys12 homolabeling and reduced Cys33 homolabeling (data not shown). Cross-linking from the N-terminal domain sites to proteins other than L7/L12 was limited to proteins L10 and L11, with L10 the strongest. For Cys12, L10 labeling exceeded that of L7/L12. The labeling of L10 from both Cys12 and Cys33 greatly exceeded L10 labe"

These results suggest a “push-pull” mechanism of import, which may be common to other post-translational translocation pathways. Most (>95%) mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. These proteins must be imported from the cytosol into the correct mitochondrial subcompartment (outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, or matrix). Import of preproteins into the innermost compartment (the matrix) is achieved by the coordinated action of two independent translocases; one in the outer and another in the inner membrane (1Glick B.

The membrane potential (negative inside) is required for the initial insertion and partial translocation of the N terminus of the precursor containing a positively charged signal sequence across the inner membrane. Subsequent translocation is completed by ATP-dependent interactions in the matrix. The mechanisms of protein translocation across various membranes apparently share some key features (19Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 20Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). One of the most striking examples is the participation of GTP in vesicular trafficking and protein trafficking to nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and chloroplasts (for review see Refs. 21Rothman J.E.

Mitochondrial import of preproteins synthesized in cell-free translation systems often requires cytosolic ATP-dependent interactions with chaperones (25Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M.

Consequently, the requirement of external ATP for import of native preproteins may not be bypassed. Due to the required presence of ATP, it has been difficult to determine the individual role of NTPs during the import process. Import of denatured precursors, however, does not require cytosolic chaperones (30Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Ostermann J.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore to investigate the GTP requirements for protein import into the mitochondrial matrix, we used a purified, urea-denatured precursor (delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, pPut) in our assay. We demonstrate that the translocation of pPut into the matrix is stimulated by GTP. The stimulatory effect by GTP is direct; it requires energy released by GTP hydrolysis and does not result from conversion of GTP to ATP. Our data strongly suggest that the mitochondrial translocation apparatus is powered by an external “push” mediated by GTP-hydrolysis and an internal ATP-dependent “pull”. Both are necessary and neither one can substitute for the other. For the preparation of radiolabeled pPut, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the plasmid pNYHM170 were induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in the presence of [35S]Met and subsequently purified as described (34Murakami H. Blobel G. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain D273-10B (ATCC 24657) (28Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Import assay buffer consisted of HSB (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.6 m sorbitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 40 mm KOAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5 mm unlabeled Met and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Import was initiated by adding urea-denatured [35S]Met-labeled pPut (75 ng) to mitochondria (100 μg) in the assay buffer. The final urea concentration was 0.16 m. A final urea concentration as high as 0.6 m does not inhibit import of native precursors (30Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Following import, reaction mixtures were treated with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice. Samples were diluted with HSB containing 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 units/ml Trasylol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondria were sedimented and washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Bands (pPut and mPut) were quantitated using the software NIH Image. Import of pPut (∼64 kDa) into isolated mitochondria was assayed by the following criteria: (i) cleavage of the signal sequence (∼3 kDa) by matrix-localized signal peptidase, (ii) protection of the signal-less mature polypeptide (mPut, ∼61 kDa) from digestion by an exogenous protease, and (iii) sedimentation of imported and protected molecules with mitochondria upon centrifugation. Import efficiency was calulated as the percent conversion of pPut to mPut as described (28Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The ladder of bands below mPut (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) are likely to result from the partial cleavage of molecules in transit to the matrix. These ladders are not the result of incomplete digestion of nonimported molecules by trypsin, since (i) when import was inhibited in the presence of valinomycin (which dissipates the ΔΨ across the inner membrane), pPut was completely digested by trypsin, and (ii) both precursor and mature forms of Put were completely digested by trypsin in the presence of Triton X-100 (not shown).Figure 2GTP-mediated import is physiologically significant. Import of urea-denatured pPut was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of GTP (lanes 2–7) or ATP (lanes 8–12). One set (panel A) of reactions was incubated for 30 min on ice; the other set (panel B) was incubated for an additional minute at 30 °C. Samples were subjected to trypsin treatment and analyzed. The import efficiency was plotted against the concentration of ATP or GTP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Both external GTP and matrix ATP are necessary for efficient import. Mitochondria were preincubated at 10 °C for 10 min in the absence, or presence of either glycerol kinase (GK) or glycerol kinase plus efrapeptin as described (8Eilers M. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of efrapeptin and GK in the import assay were 5 μg/ml and 2.8 units/ml (1.4 units/mg mitochondrial protein), respectively. All samples contained 10 mm glycerol. Where indicated, 100 μg/ml carboxyatractyloside (CAT) was included and incubated for 5 min on ice before reaction mixtures were supplemented with either ATP (1 mm) or GTP (1 mm) or αKG (5 mm), or a combination. Import of urea-denatured pPut was carried out at 30 °C for 4 min. Samples were subjected to trypsin treatment and analyzed.

Samples were then subjected to trypsin treatment and analyzed. The import efficiency was plotted against the concentration of GTPγS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the nucleotide requirements for import of urea-denatured pPut into the mitochondrial matrix at various temperatures. This is particularly important for two reasons. First, a wide range of import incubation temperatures and times have been reported in the literature. A thorough study on import kinetics, however, is lacking. Second, previous studies have concluded that GTP must be converted to ATP, presumably by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) located in the intermembrane space (6Chen W.-J. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1987; 49: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), to support protein import (9Hwang S.T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8432-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such an enzymatic exchange process is expected to be temperature-dependent. The nucleotide specificity of mitochondrial protein import needs, therefore, to be tested at various temperatures. The data presented in Fig. 1 clearly demonstrate that regardless of the temperature GTP-mediated import was always much greater (2.4–50-fold) than the corresponding ATP-mediated import. Should GTP be converted to ATP to drive import, it is very unlikely that such a conversion would ever result in import efficiency greater than that obtained by an equivalent amount of externally added ATP. Furthermore, the absolute import efficiency in GTP-containing samples were significant, ranging from 14.3% (0 °C, 30 min, Fig.1 A, lane 11) to 36.1% (30 °C, 10 min, Fig.1 D, lane 11). On the other hand, ATP could drive import to levels above 5% only at 30 °C but not at any lower temperature that we tested. Interestingly, after 5 min at 30 °C, GTP-mediated import reached a plateau, whereas ATP-mediated import was in the early stage of the ascending linear range (Fig. 1 D). With longer incubation (∼20–30 min) at 30 °C, the difference between GTP- and ATP- mediated import was much reduced (not shown). This could be due to the slow conversion of ATP, presumably by NDP kinase located in the intermembrane space (6Chen W.-J. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1987; 49: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), to GTP (i.e.ATP + GDP ⇌ ADP + GTP). This might explain why some of the earlier studies, where import incubations were longer and carried out at higher temperatures, failed to detect the GTP-stimulatory effect over that mediated by ATP (5Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Chen W.-J. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1987; 49: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W.

We conclude that (a) GTP is required for import of pPut into the matrix, and (b) GTP need not be converted to ATP to exert its stimulatory effect on import. Unlike preproteins synthesized in reticulocyte lysate, urea-denatured pPut was imported even on ice (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, import of denatured pPut did not require addition of cytosolic chaperones. Similar results were previously reported using other precursors (30Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1989; 341: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 32Becker K. Guiard B. Rassow J. Söllner T. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5637-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Koll H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1992; 68: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The urea-denatured precursor circumvents at least one highly temperature-sensitive and rate-limiting step, which presumably represents the unfolding of the native precursor prior to import into isolated mitochondria (30Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments to monitor the nucleotide requirements for import of denatured pPut into the matrix were therefore performed at low as well as physiologically relevant temperatures. We titrated (Fig. 2) the requirements of GTP (50 μm–2 mm, lanes 2–7) and ATP (100 μm–2 mm, lanes 8–12) for import of pPut. Considerable import was observed even on ice with physiological concentrations of GTP (∼100 μm, (35Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar)), and little further dose-dependent stimulation was observed beyond 200 μm (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the stimulation of mitochondrial import by GTP is physiologically significant. In contrast, ATP was much less effective; mPut that appeared in the presence of 2 mm ATP (Fig. 2 A, lane 12) was only 65% of that obtained at one-fortieth the concentration of GTP (50 μm, Fig. 2 A,lane 2). When reaction mixtures were shifted from ice to 30 °C (Fig. 2 B), GTP-mediated import was further stimulated by only about 50% to 2-fold. Under identical conditions, ATP-mediated import efficiency, however, was significantly increased (5–8-fold). Nevertheless, the GTP effect was higher than the corresponding ATP effect at all concentrations tested. Since the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to GTP (36Gasser S.M. Daum G. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13034-13041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that GTP is the primary source of external energy, both at low (0 °C, Fig. 2 A) and physiologically relevant temperatures (30 °C, Fig. 2 B). The complicated issue of the interconversion of NTPs by mitochondrial NDP kinase perhaps can best be resolved by using a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. Unfortunately, no such inhibitor is known. Alternatively, highly specific NTPases could be used to selectively deplete a particular NTP. For example, of all NTPs tested, only ATP can act as a phosphate donor substrate for E. coli glycerol kinase, which converts glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate; the reaction is essentially irreversible (37Hayashi S. Lin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1030-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has been used as a means of selectively degrading mitochondrial ATP while sparing other NTPs (8Eilers M. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This ATP-scavenging system is likely to degrade both surface-bound ATP as well as ATP in the intermembrane space. The mitochondrial outer membrane is presumably not a barrier for rapid equilibration of NTPs between the cytosol and the intermembrane space. We therefore utilized glycerol kinase to determine the NTP specificity for import in our assays. Mitochondria were pretreated with glycerol kinase plus glycerol. The ATP trap was present during import as well. Whereas ATP-mediated import was completely abolished (Fig. 3,lanes 2 and 4), GTP-mediated import was essentially unaffected (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5), thereby confirming our earlier conclusion (Figs. 1 and 2) that GTP need not be converted to ATP to exert its effect. To delineate the individual role of matrix ATP and external GTP, we performed the following experiments. Mitochondria were preincubated with efrapeptin (a potent inhibitor of the F1 moiety of mitochondrial ATPase) to block respiration-driven ATP synthesis and also with glycerol kinase (8Eilers M. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both efrapeptin and the ATP trap were present during the entire import reaction (Fig. 3, lanes 6–12). GTP-mediated import into these ATP-deprived mitochondria was reduced by about 60% (compare lanes 3 and 7), suggesting that both matrix ATP and external GTP are required for efficient import. Indeed, when ATP-deprived mitochondria were supplemented with α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to regenerate matrix ATP (10Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) through substrate-level phosphorylation via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the inhibition was almost completely relieved (compare lanes 3,7, and 10). In the absence of GTP, matrix ATP was completely ineffective (lane 12). How can we rule out the possibility that the generation of ATP from GTP by NDP kinase in the intermembrane space was extremely rapid, and that ATP so generated immediately entered into the matrix via the ADP/ATP carrier, thereby escaping the trap? This seems unlikely for two reasons: (a) carboxyatractyloside (which blocks the ADP/ATP carrier) did not interfere with the reversal of inhibition (compare lanes 10and 11); and (b) no import was detected either with ATP alone, αKG alone, or αKG plus ATP (lanes 6,8 and 9, respectively). Thus, efficient import requires both matrix ATP and external GTP; neither can replace the other. To determine whether mere GTP binding or GTP hydrolysis is necessary for import, translocation of pPut was measured (Fig. 4) in the absence or presence of a nonhydrolyzable analog, GTPγS, either on ice (lanes 2–5) or with an additional incubation at 30 °C (lanes 6–9). Under both conditions, GTP-mediated import was strongly inhibited by GTPγS in a dose-dependent manner. GTPγS alone was completely ineffective for promoting import (not shown). These data indicate that GTP hydrolysis is essential for import into the matrix. Although GTP plays an important role in protein trafficking across various membranes, thus far there is no evidence that GTP plays a direct role in mitochondrial protein import (for review see Ref. 19Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that GTP hydrolysis does indeed play a direct, essential role in translocation of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix, and that mitochondria can now be added to the list of trafficking systems where GTP hydrolysis plays a critical role. Thus, the data presented here confirm earlier predictions that protein translocation across membranes share certain key features (19Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 20Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). GTP was previously found to substitute for ATP in promoting import of preproteins into the matrix (5Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Chen W.-J. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1987; 49: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Eilers M. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was subsequently concluded that GTP must first be converted to ATP, presumably by the NDP kinase located in the intermembrane space (6Chen W.-J. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1987; 49: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), to support protein import (9Hwang S.T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8432-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ATP thus generated could enter the matrix via the ADP/ATP carrier and drive translocation. These studies were performed using ATP-depleted mitochondria (9Hwang S.T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8432-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that the GTP-mediated import into apyrase-pretreated mitochondria was much lower compared with import into untreated mitochondria (not shown). It is possible that GTP might be necessary, but not sufficient, for efficient protein import. Specifically, NTPs might exert their effect only in the presence of adequate amounts of matrix ATP. Indeed, our data demonstrate that GTP need not be converted to ATP to exert its stimulatory effect on import. Both matrix ATP and external GTP are necessary, and neither one can substitute for the other if efficient import is to be achieved. These conclusions are derived from the following results. (i) Physiological concentrations of GTP can drive significant import (Fig. 2). (ii) GTP hydrolysis is essential for import to proceed (Fig. 4). (iii) GTP-mediated import is much greater than ATP-mediated import regardless of NTP concentration, incubation temperature, or the time that we tested (Figs. 1 and 2). Depending on the conditions, GTP-mediated import is 2.4–50 times more efficient. Should GTP be converted to ATP to exert its effect on import, GTP-mediated import would be very unlikely to exceed that obtained with an identical concentration of externally added ATP. (iv) The absolute GTP-mediated import efficiency is comparable to that achieved by both ATP and GTP (not shown). (v) A specific ATP-scavenging system (like glycerol kinase and glycerol) does not inhibit GTP-mediated import (Fig. 3). (vi) GTP-mediated import into ATP-deprived mitochondria is significantly reduced but not completely abolished. Supplementing these mitochondria with αKG to regenerate matrix ATP quantitatively relieves the inhibition even in the presence of an ATP trap. Matrix ATP alone is ineffective in driving import (Fig.3). What, then, are the energetics of mitochondrial import? Two models have been proposed to explain how ATP can assist in pulling a polypeptide into the mitochondrial matrix (for review see Ref. 19Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). According to the Brownian ratchet model (38Simon S.M. Peskin C.S. Oster G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3770-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 39Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Cell. 1990; 63: 447-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), movement of the translocating chain is accomplished by Brownian motion acting in concert with the mt-Hsp70-Tim44 complex. This complex binds the incoming polypeptide chain as it emerges on the matrix side of the inner membrane channel (40Kronidou N.G. Oppliger W. Bolliger L. Hannavy K. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Horst M.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Since the translocating chain can oscillate randomly within the channel (44Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), binding of this complex on the matrix side prevents backward movement of the chain. In the translocation motor model (45Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the binding of the polypeptide chain to the mt-Hsp70-Tim44 complex stimulates ATP hydrolysis by mt-Hsp70. This leads to a conformational change in mt-Hsp70, which then actively pulls the bound precursor into the matrix. Neither of these models, however, explains the energy requirements of translocation before a sufficient length of the N terminus has reached the matrix. We propose that GTP hydrolysis shifts the equilibrium of polypeptide chains on the cis and trans sides of the inner membrane to one favoring a trans (matrix) location. Subsequently, mt-Hsp70-Tim44 cycles trap the incoming polypeptide. In addition to a ΔΨ across the inner membrane, a push-pull mechanism might be critical to mitochondrial protein import. GTP hydrolysis at the cis side, and ATP-dependent processes at thetrans side of the inner membrane presumably constitute the respective push and pull. The energy of GTP hydrolysis could improve the fidelity of the translocation process by actively pushing the polypeptide-in-transit through the import channels or else it could help maintain the polypeptide in a translocation-competent conformation during import. Recently, two GTP-binding proteins and a Hsp70 homolog with a large domain exposed to the intermembrane space have been identified as components of the outer membrane import machinery of chloroplasts (46Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 47Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These GTP-binding proteins have been suggested to be involved in regulating precursor binding at the chloroplast surface (46Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is also possible that one or both of these GTP-binding protein(s), in concert with Hsp70, provide the respective push and pull for post-translational transmembrane movement of proteins across the outer membrane of chloroplasts. Although several constituents of the mitochondrial translocation machinery have been identified (for review see Ref.48Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R100-R103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), none is reported to have a GTP-binding motif. The precise role of GTP can be determined only after identification and characterization of novel GTP-binding proteins and/or GTPases involved in mitochondrial translocation. The GTP-dependent mitochondrial translocation system described here will facilitate the identification of unknown components of the translocation apparatus and assist in revealing the mechanisms and energetics involved in the insertion and translocation of preproteins into and across mitochondrial membranes.

In the present study, we isolated a subtype of THP-1 cells that failed to accumulate esterified cholesterol when cultivated in the presence of Ac-LDL. The cells had negligible amounts of cell association and degradation of Ac-LDL compared with the parent THP-1 cells. The subtype THP-1 cells did not express ScR mRNA as well as that of lipoprotein lipase. In contrast, the expression of apolipoprotein E mRNA was greater than that found in parent THP-1 cells. The culture medium of subtype THP-1 cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inhibited the uptake of Ac-LDL and the expression of ScR in parent THP-1 cells. After a 48-h incubation in the culture medium containing 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the culture medium of differentiated subtype THP-1 cells contained 6.9 ng/ml transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, while that of parent THP-1 cells secreted below detection level, which was less than 3 ng/ml. This inhibitory effect of the conditioned medium on the expression of ScR in parent THP-1 cells was abolished by pretreatment of the culture medium with anti-TGF-β1 antibodies. Parent THP-1 cells expressed as much TGF-β1 mRNA as sTHP-1 cells after stimulation of differentiation. Although the precursor forms of TGF-β1 that were synthesized in both parent and subtype THP-1 cells were of similar size and were expressed at similar levels, latent TGF-β1-binding protein, which is necessary for the secretion of TGF-β1, could only be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-TGF-β1 antibody from subtype THP-1 cells. This suggests that subtype THP-1 cells secrete TGF-β1 into the medium by forming a functional complex with the latent TGF-β1-binding protein. We conclude that subtype THP-1 cells could not take up Ac-LDL because ScR was inhibited (leading to a loss of function) caused by the secreted TGF-β1.

The induced expression of apoE, LPL, and ScR in macrophages is regulated by a number of factors. The expression of ApoE is stimulated by cholesterol loading (19Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Havel R.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22866-22871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that TGF-β1 inhibits ScR activity in THP-1 cells. TGF-β informs a family that inhibits the growth of most epithelial cells, and it has potent effects on the accumulation of extracellular matrix components (25Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Gastroenterologia Japonica. 1993; 28: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). TGF-β is known to induce the expression of natriuretic peptide type C (CNP) in vascular endothelial cells (26Suga S. Nakao K. Ito H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y. Hama N. Imura H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and the secretion of CNP inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (27Furuya M. Yoshida M. Hayashi Y. Ohnuma N. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β may play an important role in vascular remodeling. In the present study, we have isolated a subtype of THP-1 cells (sTHP-1) that could not accumulate esterified cholesterol by Ac-LDL loading. The cells did not express ScR activity even after they were induced to differentiate. In the differentiated sTHP-1 cells, transcripts of ScR and LPL were below the detection level, and that of apoE was significantly increased compared with that of parent THP-1 cells. The conditioned medium of the differentiated sTHP-1 cells contained sufficient amounts of active TGF-β1 to suppress the expression of ScR in parent THP-1 cells. sTHP-1 cells synthesized a 190-kDa latent TGF-β1-binding protein (LTBP), which was not detectable in parent cells. We conclude that differentiated sTHP-1 cells have acquired an ability to secrete large amounts of active form of TGF-β1, which may due to its ability to express and synthesize LTBP. sTHP-1 cells may prove to be a useful model for understanding the secretion and activation mechanisms of TGF-β1 and their roles in vascular systems. THP-1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. S. Tsuchiya (Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University, School of Medicine). LDL (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml) and lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS, d > 1.215) were prepared from normal human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation as described (28Hatch F.T. Lees R.S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ac-LDL was prepared by chemical modification of the native LDL as described by Basu (29Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Ac-LDL was iodinated with Na125I (NEN Life Science Products) by the iodine monochloride method (30Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The specific activity of125I-Ac-LDL was more than 100 cpm/ng protein. Modified LDL, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-Ac-LDL (DiI-Ac-LDL) was purchased from Biomedical Technologies Inc.

A DNA fragment of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was purchased fromCLONTECH. THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone AB, Lund, Sweden) in a humidified incubator equilibrated with 5% CO2, at 37 °C. The differentiation of the cells was induced by cultivating the cells in the differentiation medium, which is Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum or 10% (v/v) LPDS and 50 ng/ml of TPA (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The differentiated cells that were incubated with 10 μg/ml Ac-LDL treatment were fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Then the cells were rinsed with propyleneglycol, and the lipids were stained with 10% oil red-O in propyleneglycol followed by staining of the nuclei with Mayer's hematoxylin (34Yamamoto A. Takaichi S. Hara H. Nishikawa O. Yokoyama S. Yamamura T. Yamaguchi T. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 106: 505-510Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were treated with TPA for 4 days, causing differentiation into macrophages, and were subsequently incubated with or without 25–500 μg/ml Ac-LDL. The cells were washed and lysed in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH. Lipids were extracted three times with chloroform and methanol (2:1). Total cholesterol and unesterified cholesterol were determined by the enzymatic method (35Richmond W. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The esterified cholesterol content was calculated by subtracting the amount of unesterified cholesterol from that of total cholesterol. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding activity of ScR was measured after incubating the cells with125I-Ac-LDL or DiI-Ac-LDL at 37 °C. For the measurement of cell-associated and degraded 125I-Ac-LDL, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml 125I-Ac-LDL for 5 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium was determined. This represented the degradation product of 125I-labeled Ac-LDL. The cells were washed and lysed in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH, and the radioactivities were determined (37Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the uptake of DiI-Ac-LDL, the cells were incubated in the presence of 5 μg/ml DiI-Ac-LDL for 4 h at 37 °C, and they were washed, dissolved, and analyzed for fluorescent intensity by spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Tokyo) with excitation at 520 nm and emission at 570 nm (38Reynolds G.D. Clair R.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 121: 200-211PubMed Google Scholar, 39Stephan Z.F. Yuracheck E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities for the associated and degraded Ac-LDL were calculated by subtracting the values in the presence of a 100-fold excess amount of unlabeled lipoproteins. After the cells were cultivated in the presence of TPA for 24–48 h, the culture medium was centrifuged at 1300 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant fraction was filtered with a 0.22-μm pore size filter. The concentrations of TGF-β1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (IFN)-γ in the culture medium were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from R & D Systems, Japan Immunoreseach Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Gumma, Japan), and Zoning Industrial (Fleurus, Belgium), respectively (40Lucas C. Bald L.N. Fendly B.M. Mora-Worms M. Figari I.S. Patzer E.J. Palladino M.A. J.

Borman A.H. J. Immunoassay. 1991; 12: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The concentration of TGF-β1 was measured after incubation in 0.1 n HCl. To the conditioned culture medium, 100 μl of anti-TGF-β1 antiserum or control nonimmune serum diluted with 300 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was added with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The mixtures were rotated at 4 °C overnight. The Sepharose beads, prebound to either anti-TGF-β1 antibodies (King Brewing Co. Ltd.) or control IgG were added to 2 ml of conditioned medium from sTHP-1 cells that had been treated with TPA for 48 h. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the supernatant fractions were recovered by centrifugation at 420 × g for 10 min. Total RNA was isolated from THP-1 cells using the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed in 0.9% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde and then transferred onto nylon membranes (Gene Screen, NEN Life Science Products). Then the membrane was hybridized at 42 °C overnight with the indicated probes, which were labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) by the multipriming method (44Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed and exposed to a Fuji Imaging Plate (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The radioactive bands were determined by a Fuji BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). TGF-β1 and its complex form were radiolabeled and immunoprecipitated as described previously by Miyazono et al. (45Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, the two types of THP-1 cells, incubated in the medium containing TPA for 3 days, were incubated in cysteine- and methionine-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 ng/ml TPA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin,l-[35S]methionine (200 μCi/ml), andl-[35S]cysteine (200 μCi/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h (pulse labeling). Then the culture medium was replaced with the RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 ng/ml TPA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 75 mg/liter l-methionine, and 250 mg/literl-cysteine and further incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (chase). The cells were then lysed and pretreated twice with control mouse IgG1κ and protein G-Sepharose. Then 1 ml of the supernatant fractions was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of mouse anti-human TGF-β1 (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) at 4 °C for 2 h. The antigen-antibody complex was recovered with 80 μl of protein G-Sepharose. The matrix was washed twice with detergent buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) and once with high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and eluted with Laemmli's buffer. Samples were electrophoresed in a 8–16% polyacrylamide gradient gel. The gel was dried and exposed to Fuji Imaging Plate. The visualized data was analyzed using a BAS 2000 image analyzer. THP-1 cells can be induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells by TPA treatment. THP-1 cells, thus treated, efficiently accumulate esterified cholesterol into vacuoles when cultivated in the presence of Ac-LDL (14Hara H. Tanishita H. Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Via D.P. Luis P. Dennison D.K. Fanslow A.E. ViBernini F. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1515-1524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the course of maintenance of THP-1 cells, we isolated by chance a subtype of THP-1 cells, which, when fully differentiated, failed to accumulate esterified cholesterol, even cultivated in the presence of Ac-LDL. As shown in Fig. 1, these sTHP-1 cells (panel B) differentiated into macrophage-like cells. Like parent THP-1 cells (panel A), they generated pseudopodia, but sTHP-1 cells could not accumulate lipids, even cultivated in the presence of Ac-LDL (10 μg/ml). Under identical conditions, parent THP-1 cells accumulated and formed oil red-O-positive vacuoles (Fig. 1 A). These vacuoles were rarely found in sTHP-1 cells (Fig. 1 B). The accumulation of esterified cholesterol in both cells was determined after incubation with 25–500 μg/ml Ac-LDL. In parent THP-1 cells, esterified cholesterol inside the cells significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, when sTHP-1 cells were treated with less than 100 μg/ml of Ac-LDL, almost no esterified cholesterol was accumulated (Fig. 2). Parent THP-1 cells accumulated about 2.5-fold more esterified cholesterol than sTHP-1 cells even in the presence of extraordinary high concentration of Ac-LDL (500 μg/ml) (Fig. 2). During the proliferative stage, the doubling time of sTHP-1 cells was identical to that of parent THP-1 cells (data not shown).Figure 2Accumulation of esterified cholesterol in parent THP-1 and sTHP-1 cells cultivated in the presence of Ac-LDL. On day 0, 1.5 × 107 cells were seeded into 10-cm plastic dishes and cultivated in 6 ml of the differentiation medium containing 10% LPDS. On day 4, the medium was replaced with a fresh one supplemented with 0–500 μg/ml Ac-LDL. On day 6, the cells were harvested, and esterified cholesterol was determined. Each point is the mean of two samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the difference in accumulation of esterified cholesterol between the two cell types was directly due to the function of ScR, the binding and degradation activities of 125I-labeled Ac-LDL were measured (Fig. 3, A and B). In parent THP-1 cells, the binding and degradation activities of labeled Ac-LDL increased after the addition of TPA. However, the cell-associated and degraded Ac-LDL were almost undetectable in sTHP-1 cells even after 5-day treatment with TPA. These data suggest that sTHP-1 cells had some defects in ScR activity. To examine if the defect of ScR activity in sTHP-1 cells was at the transcriptional level, the expression of ScR mRNA was determined. In differentiated parent THP-1 cells, the ScR mRNA was detected after one-day treatment with TPA, and increased thereafter (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, in sTHP-1 cells, ScR mRNA was not detected even after 5-day cultivation. The expression of mRNAs of LPL and apoE, which is reported to be induced after differentiation into macrophages, was also determined. While parent THP-1 cells increased the mRNA level of LPL by the TPA treatment, sTHP-1 cells showed little expression even after a 5-day incubation with TPA (Fig. 4 B). After the TPA treatment, the induction of apoE mRNA was faster and greater in sTHP-1 cells than in parent THP-1 cells (Fig. 4 C). The induction of apoE expression supports the theory that sTHP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by the TPA treatment. In sTHP-1 cells, the induction of not only ScR mRNA but also LPL mRNA was suppressed; at the same time, however, induction of apoE was not suppressed by the TPA treatment. Thus, we expected that the phenotype of sTHP-1 cells that lack in ScR activity might be epigenetic. We first tested if the culture medium obtained from sTHP-1 cells treated with TPA (sT-CM) might have some effects on the expression of ScR activity in parent THP-1 cells. Expectedly, the sT-CM obtained after 24 and 48 h of cultivation in the presence of TPA inhibited the ScR activity in parent THP-1 cells 63 and 94%, respectively (Fig. 5). The sT-CM without TPA treatment showed almost no effect on ScR activity in parent THP-1 cells. This inhibitory effect was not directly on the binding of Ac-LDL to ScR, because the measurement of ScR binding activity was not affected with the sT-CM (data not shown). The sT-CM suppressed the transcript level of ScR mRNA in differentiated parent THP-1 cells to 31.8% of that of the control level. The suppression of the ScR activity in parent THP-1 cells was at least at the transcriptional level (Fig.6 A). Similarly, the sT-CM suppressed LPL mRNA expression in differentiated parent THP-1cells (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the component(s) that was secreted into the medium from the differentiated sTHP-1 cells, was responsible for the observed suppression in parent THP-1 cells.Figure 6Effect of sT-CM on the expression of ScR and LPL mRNA in parent THP-1 cells. Total RNA (20 μg/ml) was prepared from parent THP-1 cells cultivated for 48 h in the differentiation medium (lane 1) or sT-CM (lane 2) and was hybridized with ScR cDNA (A) or LPL cDNA (B). Each membrane sheet was rehybridized with human GAPDH probe as an internal standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify which component(s) in the sT-CM was responsible for the suppression of the ScR and LPL expression, the concentration of three cytokines, TGF-β1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, which were reported to affect the expression of ScR and LPL, were determined (20Zuckerman S.H.

While the culture media from undifferentiated sTHP-1 cells and differentiated and undifferentiated parent cells contained below the detection level of TGF-β1, those of differentiated sTHP-1 cells obtained after incubation with TPA for 24 and 48 h contained 3.9 and 6.7 ng/ml TGF-β1, respectively (TableI). Because there is no difference in concentration of TNF-α or IFN-γ in the culture media from parent THP-1 and sTHP-1, TGF-β1 was the candidate for the factor in the sT-CM that inhibits the expression of ScR and LPL mRNAs in parent THP-1 cells.Table IThe concentration of TGF-β1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in the conditioned medium obtained from the parent THP-1 cells and sTHP-1 with or without TPA treatmentsTHP-1, TPA(−)sTHP-1, TPA(+) 24hsTHP-1, TPA(+) 48hTHP-1, TPA(−)THP-1, TPA(+) 48hTGF-β1 (ng/ml)<33.96.7<3<3TNF-α (pg/ml)<5786414<5626IFN-γ (units/ml)1.01.01.41.41.6 Open table in a new tab The sT-CM was pretreated with anti-TGF-β1 antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose. The treated sT-CM, which contained TGF-β1 below the detection level, lost the inhibitory effect on that ScR activity in differentiated parent THP-1 cells, and the ScR activity was at a level similar to that of the cells treated without sT-CM (Fig. 7). The sT-CM treated with control antibodies suppressed ScR activity to the same extent as that without the antibody treatment. The data suggest that TGF-β1 significantly secreted from the differentiated sTHP-1 cells is a major factor that suppresses the expression of ScR activity in parent THP-1 cells. Thus, it was strongly suggested that the negligible level of ScR expression in sTHP-1 cells was due to the increased level of TGF-β1 produced by own cells. TGF-β1 mRNA expression was determined in parent THP-1 and sTHP-1 cells. Before the TPA treatment, neither type of cells expressed TGF-β1 mRNA. After TPA treatment, both types of cells started to express TGF-β1 mRNA (Fig.8). The expression profiles of TGF-β1 mRNA in the two cell types were similar. TGF-β1 is known to be synthesized as a precursor protein (about 48 kDa) that attaches to LTBP (about 195 kDa) to form the functional secretory complex (45Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). To know which of these steps is responsible for the overproduction of TGF-β1 in sTHP-1 cells, all cell proteins were radiolabeled, and then TGF-β1 was immunoprecipitated with specific antibody. As shown in Fig.9, four radiolabeled bands, 190, 70, 48, and 45 kDa were observed in sTHP-1 cells (lane 2). The 190-kDa protein band, thought to be LTBP (45Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), was seen in sTHP-1 cells but not in parent THP-1 cells (compare lanes 1 and2). The 48- and 45-kDa protein bands are thought to be the precursor form of TGF-β1 and were seen both in sTHP-1 and parent THP-1 cells. The 190-, 48-, and 45-kDa but not the 70-kDa bands decreased when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of TGF-β1, suggesting that the 70-kDa protein precipitated nonspecifically. After a 4-h chase, 190-, 48-, and 45-kDa bands in sTHP-1 cells significantly decreased (lane 4). The 48- and 45-kDa bands in parent THP-1 cells decreased as well; however, the decrease level was small compared with those in sTHP-1 cells (lane 3). All of the results obtained indicate that the secretion of TGF-β1 was accelerated in sTHP-1 cells due to the increased formation of the functional secretory complex with LTBP. ScR are able to bind and internalize modified lipoproteins, such as acetylated and oxidized LDL. Different from LDL receptor, the ScR activity is not regulated by the intracellular concentration of cholesterol. Therefore, the continuous uptake of modified LDL leads to great accumulation of cholesterol into the cells. It has been reported that nonmacrophage cells, transfected with the cDNA encoding ScR, accumulate cholesterol and become foam cells (50Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Roher L. Penman M. Freedman N.J. Chisolm G.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ScR are expected to play an important role in the foam cell formation. THP-1 cells possess many of the characteristics of monocyte-macrophages, especially in the lipid metabolism. They begin to express ScR and secrete greater amounts of apoE and LPL (14Hara H.

Curtiss L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Kafonek S.D. Raikhel I. Bachorik P.S. Kwiterovich Jr., P.O.

Invest. 1984; 93: 89-98Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a subtype of THP-1, sTHP-1 cells, which demonstrated negligible amounts of ScR activity, even after the differentiation. Consequently, the cells failed to become foam cells by cultivation with Ac-LDL at a relatively low concentration. The lack of ScR activity in sTHP-1 cells was due to the suppression of the expression of ScR mRNA. The lack of ScR activity in sTHP-1 cells may not be due to dedifferentiation of the cells, because 1) the doubling time of sTHP-1 cells was similar to those of parent cells, and 2) apoE mRNA, which is a differentiation marker for macrophages, was induced to express in sTHP-1 cells with TPA treatment. A loss of regulation in the expression of these genes was indicated to be the cause for acquired new phenotypes of sTHP-1 cells. As expected, the sT-CM inhibited the ScR activity of parent THP-1 cells. The inhibitory effect of the conditioned medium on the induction of ScR activity depended on the cultivation time of the differentiated sTHP-1 cells. These results supported the hypothesis that factor(s) that caused the suppression of ScR mRNA in the parent THP-1 cells had been secreted from the differentiated sTHP-1 cells. Macrophages have been reported to produce and secrete a large variety of cytokines, which are known to modulate the macrophage functions and cell marker expression (54Cavaillon J.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1994; 48: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that there was a factor that could change the expression of ScR and LPL in sTHP-1 cells. First, we measured the concentrations of cytokines in the culture medium of sTHP-1 cells. TGF-β1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ are known to suppress the expression of both ScR and LPL mRNAs (22Sparks R.L. Allen B.J. Strauss E.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 150: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Bottalico L.A. Wager R.E. Agellon L.B. Assoian R.K. Tabas I. J. Biol.

Acta. 1990; 1053: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The concentrations of TGF-β1 in culture media of sTHP-1 cells (sT-CM) and parent THP-1 cells were quite different. The sT-CM contained significantly higher concentrations of TGF-β1 compared with that of parent cells. TGF-β1 in the sT-CM increased in a time-dependent manner, which was parallel to the ability to inhibit the ScR activity (see Fig. 5). The treatment of sT-CM with anti-TGF-β1 antibodies abolished the inhibitory effect of the sT-CM on ScR activity of differentiated THP-1 cells. The results clearly indicate that the component that inhibited the ScR activity was TGF-β1, suggesting that sTHP-1 cells had acquired the ability to produce TGF-β1 in the presence of TPA. TGF-β1 is reported to decrease the expression of ScR mRNA in THP-1 cells (24Bottalico L.A. Wager R.E. Agellon L.B. Assoian R.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22866-22871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LPL mRNA in preadipocytes (22Sparks R.L. Allen B.J. Strauss E.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 150: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and to increase apoE mRNA in macrophages (20Zuckerman S.H. Evans G.F. O'Neal L. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 96: 203-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The present results agree with the findings in previous reports and show that the TGF-β1 secreted from sTHP-1 cells suppressed the transcript levels of ScR and LPL mRNAs and increased the level of ApoE mRNA. Due to the acquisition of an ability to secrete TGF-β1, sTHP-1 cells lost their ability to accumulate cholesterol. Bottalico et al. (24Bottalico L.A. Wager R.E. Agellon L.B. Assoian R.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22866-22871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that 24 pmTGF-β1 has an ability to inhibit 70% of the uptake activity of Ac-LDL through ScR in the differentiated THP-1 cells. The concentration of TGF-β1 required to acquire maximal suppression of ScR activity in THP-1 cells was 10 times higher in the present study than that reported by Bottalico et al. (24Bottalico L.A. Wager R.E. Agellon L.B. Assoian R.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22866-22871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the concentration of TGF-β1 in the sT-CM after 24 and 48 h of treatment with TPA was 3.9 ng/ml, which is about 160 pm, and 6.7 ng/ml, which is about 270 pm, respectively. These concentrations of TGF-β1 inhibited 63 and 94% of the uptake activities of Ac-LDL by parent THP-1 cells, respectively (Fig. 5). TGF-β1 is known to be synthesized and secreted as latent complex from the producer cells. The latent TGF-β1 complex in human and rat platelets is composed of three different components: mature TGF-β1, the TGF-β1 latency-associated peptide, and the LTBP (57Okada F. Yamaguchi K. Ichihara A. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 59Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7646-7654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latent TGF-β1 is biologically inactive, and the activation of the latent complexes is an important step for the regulation of TGF-β1 activity. The N-terminal remnant of the TGF-β1 precursor is sufficient for TGF-β1 latency. TGF-β1 in this latent complex can be activated in vitro by treatment with acid, urea, or heat (59Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is reasonable to speculate that most of the TGF-β1 in the culture medium of sTHP-1 cells might be in the latent form. Since TGF-β1 concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in acidic conditions, both latent and active forms of TGF-β1 were included in the measurements. Therefore, a higher concentration of TGF-β1 was necessary for the maximal inhibition of the ScR activity in our assay system. In our study, TGF-β1 was not detected in the culture medium of parent THP-1 cells, even after stimulation of TPA. The parent THP-1 cells showed almost as much TGF-β1 mRNA as did sTHP-1 cells (Fig. 8). In sTHP-1 cells, considerable amounts of LTBP were immunoprecipitated with anti-TGF-β1, suggesting that LTBP was forming a functional complex with TGF-β1 precursor only in sTHP-1 cells. This might explain the high concentration of TGF-β1 in the culture media of sTHP-1 cells, since LTBP is reported to play a crucial role in the secretion of TGF-β1 (45Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). An increased rate of formation of the TGF-β1-LTBP complex could be explained by either enhanced production of LTBP in sTHP-1 cells or a defect in complex formation in parent THP-1 cells. Since sTHP-1 cells are derived from THP-1 cells, it is reasonable to suppose that a defect(s), if it exists, should occur in sTHP-1 cells rather than in parent THP-1 cells. Therefore, a defect in sTHP-1 cells could possibly be the failure to suppress either the synthesis of LTBP or the formation of a functional secretion complex with LTBP. The latter possibility may be tested when a specific antibody against LTBP becomes available. sTHP-1 cells will be a useful model for investigating the regulation of secretion of TGF-β1.

Phosphorylation of this R1, in solution or on blot, results mainly from the activity of casein kinase II (CKII), a co-purifying protein kinase.

CKII target sites were mapped to an acidic serine-rich segment of the R1 N terminus. Improvement in purification of the R1 expressed in eukaryotic cells nearly completely abolished its phosphorylation potential. An extremely low level of phosphorylation observed in the presence of Mn2+ with the R1 produced in E. coli was probably due to an unidentified prokaryotic protein kinase.

The herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1 and -2) 1The abbreviations used are: HSV, herpes simplex virus; PK, protein kinase; FSBA, p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5′-adenosine; CKII, casein kinase II; DTT, dithiothreitol; NDPK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ribonucleotide reductases, which convert ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, play a key role in the synthesis of viral DNA (1Stubbe J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 349-419PubMed Google Scholar). A peculiar feature of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 ribonucleotide reductases was found in the amino acid sequence of their R1 proteins; in contrast to the R1 of other species, including those of other herpesviruses, the HSV-1 and -2 R1 subunits possess an N-terminal extension of about 350 amino acids (2Nikas I. McLauchlan J. Davison A.J. Taylor W.R. Clements J.B. Proteins. 1986; 1: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Swain M.A. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 802-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been clearly shown that this extension, which appears to be linked to the reductase domain by a protease-sensitive region, is dispensable for ribonucleotide reduction (4Conner J. Macfarlane J. Lankinen H. Marsden H. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Conner J. Cross A. Murray J. Marsden H. J. Gen.

From sequence comparisons with eukaryotic PKs, Chung et al. (8Chung T.D. Wymer J.P. Smith C.C. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3389-3398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to propose that the unique N-terminal domain of HSV R1 could be a PK domain. Among the experimental evidence that has been accumulated thereafter in favor of this hypothesis, the more convincing are the following: (i) the N terminus of the HSV-2 R1 produced with a bacterial expression system and purified by immunoprecipitation is able to phosphorylate histones and calmodulin (9Luo J.H. Smith C.C. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20976-20983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) both HSV-1 and -2 R1 are labeled by the ATP analogue [14C]FSBA, which covalently binds to the active-site lysine of eukaryotic PKs (10Cooper J. Conner J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4979-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Luo J.H. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9645-9653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) both HSV-1 and -2 R1 produced in eukaryotic cells retrieve their capacity to be phosphorylated after migration on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and renaturation on blot (11Luo J.H. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9645-9653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Jolicoeur, N. (1994) Functional Study of the N-terminal Extension of the R1 Subunit of the Herpes Simplex Type 2 Ribonucleotide Reductase. M.Sc. thesis, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.Google Scholar); (iv) a protein exhibiting a weak homology with the N-terminal domain of HSV-2 R1 (termed FAST) was described as a PK involved in the phosphorylation of TIA-1 during Fas-induced apoptosis (13Tian Q.S. Taupin J.L. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, subsequent observations indicated that the R1 N-terminal domain should belong to a novel type of PK. Deletions of different parts of the protein showed that several of the classical PK consensus sequences could be removed without loss of protein phosphorylation (10Cooper J. Conner J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4979-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Luo J.H. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9645-9653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]FSBA, which inhibits the R1 labeling by [γ-32P]ATP, does not bind to residues located in the putative PK domain but to a site in the reductase domain (10Cooper J. Conner J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4979-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of histones observed with the HSV-1 and -2 R1 proteins purified following expression in Escherichia coli was shown to be the result of a contaminant prokaryotic kinase; surprisingly, this kinase appears to be able to phosphorylate, in the presence of MnCl2, several other eukaryotic proteins. After elimination of the prokaryotic kinase responsible for the histone phosphorylation, both types of R1 retain a weak capacity to be phosphorylated in the presence of MnCl2 (1 R1 molecule/≈2,400 being labeled in 30 min). From these observations, even if the rate of32Pi incorporation was very low, it was concluded that these proteins had intrinsic PK activity (10Cooper J. Conner J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4979-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Conner J. Cooper J. Furlong J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the above mentioned studies, the possibility that the R1 phosphorylation was accomplished by residual contaminant PK(s) was never completely ruled out. During the development of E. coli and adenovirus expression vectors for the production of HSV-2 R1, we observed that efficient phosphorylation of R1 protein and of casein was obtained only with preparations purified from eukaryotic cells. As improvement in the purification of the HSV-2 R1 expressed in eukaryotic cells greatly diminished the capacity of the protein to incorporate [γ-32P]ATP, we critically reanalyzed the origin(s) of R1 phosphorylation for both recombinant proteins. We found that the PK activity attributed to R1 was due to contaminating cellular PKs. Casein β, calf thymus histones, calmodulin, heparin, polylysine, and protamine sulfate were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]ATP (4,000 Ci/mmol) were from ICN and [3H]CDP (18 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Life Science. Affi-Prep 10 support, bovine serum albumin standard, and the Bio-Rad protein assay kit were from Bio-Rad. Polyclonal antibodies directed against a peptide corresponding to residues 70–91 of the CKII α and CKII purified from sea urchin were kindly provided by S. Pelech (15Charlton L.A. Sanghera J.S. Clark-Lewis I. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8840-8845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure human recombinant CKII was from Boehringer Mannheim. Purified HSV-1 R1 (DN247) was kindly provided by Joe Conner (14Conner J. Cooper J. Furlong J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus Ad5BM5-R1 was used to produce BM5-R1 in human 293S cells as described previously (16Massie B. Dionne J. Lamarche N. Fleurent J. Langelier Y. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Crude cytoplasmic extracts of infected cells were prepared by Dounce homogenization of phosphate-buffered saline washed cells suspended in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 2 mm DTT) followed by a 12,000 × gcentrifugation. The resulting supernatant (S12) was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C (S100). The production and partial purification of the HSV-2 R1 in E. coli with a pET vector (pET-R1) were performed as described by Furlong et al. (17Furlong J. Conner J. McLauchlan J. Lankinen H. Galt C. Marsden H.S. Clements J.B. Virology. 1991; 182: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with the exception that the proteins were precipitated by 25% ammonium sulfate instead of 45%. The peptidoaffinity method used for the R1 purification was modified from the one developed for R1 expressed in HSV-1-infected cells (18Paradis H. Gaudreau P. Massie B. Lamarche N. Guilbault C. Gravel S. Langelier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9647-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100–150 mg of S100 proteins were diluted at 2 mg/ml in buffer A containing 2.5 mm bacitracin and loaded on a 40-ml column of Affi-Prep-coupled peptide. After washing with 50 column volumes of buffer A, the R1 protein was eluted with 15 ml of buffer A containing 200 μm peptide acetyl-YAGAIVNDL. In some cases, a high salt wash (40 ml of 2 m NaCl in buffer A) was performed before the R1 elution. Ultrafiltration with Centriprep-30 (Amicon) was used to concentrate the eluted R1 and to reduce the concentration of the eluting peptide below 0.2 μm. The protein purity was assessed by laser densitometric scanning of a lane containing 10 μg of protein on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and by immunoblot analysis performed with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the purified protein. Purified preparations of both R1 proteins usually contained ≈75% full-length 140-kDa R1, ≈20% 135-kDa degradation product, 2% other minor degradation products, and <3% other protein contaminants. As the full-length R1 and the 135-kDa degradation product migrated as a doublet, they were considered as one entity in all our subsequent R1 quantification. Further purification of 50 μg of either pET-R1 or NaCl-washed BM5-R1 was performed by velocity sedimentation on 4 ml of 20–40% glycerol gradient in buffer A containing 250 mmNaCl at 55,000 rpm with a SW60 rotor (Beckman) for 24 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 200 μl were collected starting from the bottom of the gradient (19Lamarche N. Matton G. Massie B. Fontecave M. Atta M. Dumas F. Gaudreau P. Langelier Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As control for PK inactivation during the centrifugation, protein samples at 100 μg/ml were incubated in parallel in 30% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Quantification of the percentage of recombinant R1 in protein extracts was done by densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained gels as described previously (16Massie B. Dionne J. Lamarche N. Fleurent J. Langelier Y. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For assays with the unpurified recombinant subunits, aliquots of the S12-, S100-, or ammonium sulfate- treated fractions were centrifuged through Sephadex G-25 columns to remove molecules inhibitory for reductase activity. R1 specific activity was determined by adding to limiting amounts of R1 excess amounts of R2 purified fromE. coli bearing the pET-R2 expression vector (60 units/mg). R2 specific activity was determined by adding to limiting amounts of R2 excess amounts of purified R1 obtained from Ad5BM5-R1-infected 293 cells (55 units/mg) (16Massie B. Dionne J. Lamarche N. Fleurent J. Langelier Y. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The host cell (human or E. coli) ribonucleotide reductase activities were undetectable with the standard assay for the HSV enzyme, which contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm DTT, 50 μm CDP, and 0.25 μCi of [3H]CDP in a volume of 30 μl. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme generating 1 nmol of dCDP/min (16Massie B. Dionne J. Lamarche N. Fleurent J. Langelier Y. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The standard assay to measure the phosphorylation of R1 or other proteins in solution contained in 30 μl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 2 mm DTT, 0.3m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (18Paradis H. Gaudreau P. Massie B. Lamarche N. Guilbault C. Gravel S. Langelier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9647-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the phosphorylation of casein β, pET-R2, calf thymus histones, 10 μg of each protein were included in the assay whereas for calmodulin 5 μg were used. In those conditions, the rates of phosphorylation were usually linear during the entire 10-min incubation period at 37 °C. In some cases, the reaction mixture contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mmMnCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described by Cooper et al. (10Cooper J. Conner J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4979-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described by Peng et al. (20Peng T. Hunter J.R.C. Nelson J.W. Virology. 1996; 216: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the glycerol gradient fractions, 20-μl samples were added to the phosphorylation mixture. After Coomassie Blue staining, the reaction was stopped by boiling in gel loading buffer and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and, when appropriate, the amount of R1 in each lane was evaluated by laser densitometric comparison with R1 standard. To quantify the phosphate incorporation, the bands corresponding to R1 or to other substrate were cut and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. 32Piincorporation from [γ-32P]ATP after immobilization of the proteins on polyvinyl fluoride membrane was performed, unless otherwise stated under “Results,” as described by Luo and Aurelian (11Luo J.H. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9645-9653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled proteins was performed after 1 h of digestion in 6 m HCl at 110 °C (21van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) whereas a sensitive high performance liquid chromatography method was used to quantify the amount of phosphoamino acids in unlabeled proteins (22Murthy L.R. Iqbal K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). NDPK assay conditions were the same as for the ribonucleotide reductase assay except that the reactions, which contained 5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2, were performed in the absence of HSV-2 R2 subunit. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 10 min and the protein precipitates were removed by centrifugation. Before spotting on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates, rC, CMP, CDP, and CTP, each at a final concentration of 5 mm, were added as markers. The nucleotides were separated by ascending chromatography with 0.2 m sodium bicarbonate, and the radioactivity associated with each UV-visualized spot was measured. Nucleotide phosphatase measurements were performed in parallel reactions devoid of ATP and MgCl2 using [3H]CDP as substrate. The assay was devised from a method originally described to measure nucleotide binding to theE. coli R1 (23Ormo M. Sjoberg B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified R1 protein was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C usually at a concentration of 2 μmwith 0–10 μm [α-32P]ATP in 150 μl of the phosphorylation assay mixture containing either 5 mmMgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2. Ultrafiltration used to measure free ATP concentration was performed as we recently described (19Lamarche N. Matton G. Massie B. Fontecave M. Atta M. Dumas F. Gaudreau P. Langelier Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The specific binding of the nucleotide to the R1 was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding measured in the absence of R1. To study both domains of the HSV-2 R1, the R1 gene was introduced in the adenovirus Ad5ΔE1ΔE3 to create the recombinant Ad5BM5-R1 (16Massie B. Dionne J. Lamarche N. Fleurent J. Langelier Y. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and in the bacterial expression vector pET11c, which gave pET-R1. Purification of both types of recombinant R1 by peptidoaffinity gave protein preparations, which contained <5% of host cell protein contaminants (Fig. 1). Initial phosphorylation assays were performed with MgCl2using conditions optimized for HSV-1 R1 purified from HSV-1-infected cells (18Paradis H. Gaudreau P. Massie B. Lamarche N. Guilbault C. Gravel S. Langelier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9647-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, whereas the reductase activity of BM5-R1 and pET-R1 was similar (Table I), phosphorylation of the R1 protein and casein could be observed only with preparations purified from eukaryotic cells (Fig.2, lanes 1–4). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 32P-labeled BM5-R1 detected phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. In addition, we noticed that the rate of BM5-R1 phosphorylation among different batches of purified protein varied largely from 0.04 to 0.64 nmol/min/mg with a parallel variation in the extent of the phosphorylation of either casein (from 0.01 to 0.17 nmol/min/mg) or other substrates. Histones were ≈32-fold poorer phosphate acceptors than casein. Calmodulin was also efficiently phosphorylated but only when assayed in the presence of 10 μm polylysine. IgGs (either polyclonal or monoclonal) and the recombinant R2 subunit of HSV-2 ribonucleotide reductase were not phosphorylated at all. Interestingly, the formation of the ribonucleotide reductase holoenzyme by the addition of R2 did not alter the rate of R1 phosphorylation.Table IComparison of enzymatic activities at different stages of HSV-2 R1 purificationPurification stepR1 concentrationRibonucleotide reductasePhosphorylation1-aMeasured with standard assay conditions.NDPKR1Casein%nmol/min/mgpmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgBM5-R1 S10081-bMeasured by densitometric comparison with a standard of pure R1.2.92315ND1-cND, not determined.154.3 Purified − NaCl wash921-dEvaluated by laser densitometric scanning of a lane containing 10 μg of protein on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel.26.640165.4 Purified + NaCl wash951-dEvaluated by laser densitometric scanning of a lane containing 10 μg of protein on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel.29.210.61.14pET-R1 Purified − NaCl wash931-dEvaluated by laser densitometric scanning of a lane containing 10 μg of protein on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel.25.3<0.1<0.1<0.001 HSV-1 R1 (DN247)901-dEvaluated by laser densitometric scanning of a lane containing 10 μg of protein on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel.11.7<0.1ND1-cND, not determined.ND1-cND, not determined.1-a Measured with standard assay conditions.1-b Measured by densitometric comparison with a standard of pure R1.1-c ND, not determined.1-d Evaluated by laser densitometric scanning of a lane containing 10 μg of protein on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel.

Conner J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4979-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Conner J. Cooper J. Furlong J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, with the assay conditions used in the studies quoted above (MnCl2instead of MgCl2 and only radioactive ATP), a very weak R1 phosphorylation (2 fmol/min/mg) could be detected, which was not enhanced by the addition of protamine sulfate. Casein, calmodulin, IgGs, and the HSV-2 R2 subunit were not phosphorylated when added to 2 μg of pET-R1, whereas histones were labeled just above background. As the maximal level of phosphorylation that we obtained for pET-R1 was 50-fold lower than the one reported by Cooper et al. (10Cooper J. Conner J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4979-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first suspected that a deleterious mutation had been introduced in the N-terminal domain of the R1 gene during the vector construction. This possibility was made unlikely by the construction of two other pET-R1 expression vectors (pET-R1b and pET-R1c) using the HSV-2 R1 coding sequences contained in the pAdBM5 transfer vector, which had been sequenced prior to its use to create the BM5-R1 recombinant. The R1 protein purified from E. coli bearing either pET-R1b or -c did not incorporate higher amounts of 32Pithan pET-R1 (data not shown). Second, we considered the possibility that our purification procedure had not completely eliminated phosphatases, ATP hydrolases, and other inhibitory molecules abundantly present in crude bacterial extracts (24Cozzone A.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As nucleotide phosphatase activity was undetectable in our pure R1 preparations, ATP degradation could not be involved in the nearly complete incapacity of pET-R1 to be labeled by [γ-32P]ATP. In addition, the low labeling of pET-R1 could not be attributed to the presence of inhibitory molecules in pET-R1 purified preparations as mixtures of pET-R1 with BM5-R1 did not impair the high 32Pi incorporation observed with the latter protein (data not shown). On the contrary, when a 10-fold lower amount of BM5-R1 was introduced in the mixture, a strong increase in the R1 labeling was observed indicating that pET-R1 could be a substrate either of BM5-R1 or of a co-purifying PK (Fig. 2,lanes 9 and 10). The latter possibility became more likely when a strong R1 labeling was obtained upon the mixing of pET-R1 with a crude extract of Ad5ΔE1ΔE3-infected 293 cells (Fig.3, lane 3). Moreover, using a purified preparation of an HSV-1 R1 protein deleted of its first 247 amino acids (DN247; see Fig. 1, lane 7), evidence was obtained that an E. coli protein could phosphorylate pET-R1. Hence, a mixture of 2 μg of DN247 (unlabeled itself) with pET-R1 produced a 16-fold increase in the phosphorylation of the later. Phosphoaminoacid analysis of 32P-labeled pET-R1 identified serine as the only modified residue (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggested that HSV-2 R1 does not possess an intrinsic autophosphorylating activity but instead is a good substrate for PK originating from the host cell. To further substantiate this, we next searched to identify the PK(s) co-purifying with BM5-R1 and, more importantly, to understand how such an enzyme could produce the R1 phosphorylation seen on blot. To demonstrate that a PK activity was co-purifying with R1, we attempted to separate the enzyme from its substrate by washing with 2m NaCl the BM5-R1 protein bound to the affinity column. As shown in Fig. 2, this wash produced a 40-fold reduction in the R1 (compare lanes 6 and 7) and casein phosphorylation (Table I). Calmodulin and histone phosphorylations were no longer detectable (data not shown). The addition of a small fraction of the NaCl wash desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration restored a substantial level of R1 labeling (lane 8). The absence of R1 in the NaCl wash, shown in Fig. 1 (lane 4) with a Coomassie Blue-stained gel, was clearly demonstrated by a silver-stained gel and a ribonucleotide reductase assay (data not shown). In Table I, the capacity of the protein to incorporate32Pi after each step of purification is compared with its reductase activity. In addition, the activity of NDPK, a highly active cellular enzyme (650 μmol/min/mg; see Refs. 25Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F. Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14643-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholarand 26Postel E.H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 233-252PubMed Google Scholar), is also presented. Whereas the specific activity of ribonucleotide reductase increased 10-fold in parallel with the concentration of the R1 subunit indicating that the purification procedure did not affect the subunit structure, the R1 phosphorylation exhibited an overall decrease of 300-fold. The observation that the decrease was much less significant after the affinity step than after the NaCl wash (8-fold compared with 40-fold) is also an indication that a co-purifying PK could be responsible of the R1 labeling. The more efficient removal for NDPK by the affinity step (30-fold compared with 5-fold) strengthens this hypothesis. It is noticeable that the residual NDPK activity is 1,000-fold greater than the rate of R1 phosphorylation. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to conclude that this activity is catalyzed by the R1 protein itself because, once again, pET-R1 did not exhibit such an activity (<1 pmol/min/mg). Thus, it is far more plausible to estimate, from the known specific activity of human NDPK, that our pure BM5-R1 preparations contain a 0.0002% level of NDPK contamination than to conclude that the HSV-2 R1 is a primitive NDPK exhibiting 8 × 10−6 less activity than the human enzyme. As some of the motifs present in the R1 N-terminal domain are found in ATP-binding proteins which are not PKs, the ATP binding capacity of the highly purified BM5-R1 was assayed using filter ultrafiltration to separate free versus bound nucleotides and was found to be below the detection limits of our assay (K d > 0.1 mm for one binding site). As a positive control of the assay, binding of CDP (one of the substrates of the reductase domain) was evaluated. These measurements gave a K d value of 6 μm with 1.6 mol of CDP bound/mol of R1 subunit. A very low level of ATP binding was detected using 100 μg of the protein preparation exhibiting the highest phosphorylation potential, consistent with the presence of a trace amount of contaminating PK. The HSV2-R1 labeling seen in PK assays on blot has been taken as a nearly irrefutable proof for the autophosphorylation potential of this protein because, in such an assay, the denatured proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE before their blotting onto a membrane (11Luo J.H. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9645-9653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two hypotheses were successively considered to explain how a contaminating eukaryotic PK could be responsible for the R1 labeling on the blot. First, comigration of the contaminating PK with the R1 protein on the gel appears likely from initial observations made in PK assays on blot similar to the one presented in the right panel of Fig. 3. As can be seen, BM5-R1 from preparations unwashed with NaCl exhibited a high degree of phosphorylation (lane 5), whereas pET-R1 was not labeled (lane 8). A faint labeled band was seen at the R1 position in an adjacent lane, which contained a crude extract of Ad5ΔE1ΔE3-infected 293 cells. To test if"

Tannahill D. Slack J.M.W. Development (Camb.). 1992; 114: 711-720PubMed Google Scholar), are present in mesoderm formation stages during early embryonic development, eFGF is more likely to be an endogenous inducer since it is efficiently secreted. bFGF, however, lacks a signal sequence for secretion. Xenopus eFGF is expressed maternally, and its expression increases significantly during gastrulation, suggesting its roles in mesoderm induction as well as mesoderm maintenance (17Isaacs H.V. Pownall M.E. Slack J.M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4469-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The components of the FGF signal transduction pathway required for mesoderm induction include Ras (18Whitman M. Melton D.A.

One nuclear target of FGF signaling seems to be Xbra, aXenopus homologue of Brachuary (25Smith J.C. Price B.M.J. Green J.B.A. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Xbra has been used as a panmesodermal marker, and its expression is increased by treatment with mesoderm inducers including members of the FGF and transforming growth factor-β families. While ectopic overexpression of Xbra is enough to induce the differentiated mesoderm, mesoderm formation in response to Xbra requires FGF signaling (13Schulte-Merker S. Smith J.C. Curr. Biol. 1955; 5: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Xbra and eFGF have been shown to be involved in the autoregulatory loop, in which Xbra induces the expression of eFGF, which is required for maintenance of the expression of Xbra (17Isaacs H.V. Pownall M.E. Slack J.M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4469-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, we have been interested in the roles of AP-1 duringXenopus early embryonic development (26Dong Z. Xu R.-H. Kim J. Zhan S.-N. Ma W.-Y. Colburn N.H. Kung H.-f. J. Biol.

We recently reported the involvement of AP-1/c-Jun in the FGF signaling pathway using dominant-negative jun (DN-jun) (26Dong Z. Xu R.-H. Kim J. Zhan S.-N. Ma W.-Y. Colburn N.H. Kung H.-f. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9942-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the requirement for AP-1/c-Jun in FGF-induced mesoderm induction has been demonstrated by loss-of-function activity using DN-jun, these experiments cannot discriminate between the involvement of homodimeric and heterodimeric AP-1 in mesoderm induction. Also, we cannot conclude whether AP-1 is a necessary or a sufficient component in the pathway leading to mesoderm induction. Since the DNA-binding activity of the homodimeric Jun complex and the heterodimeric Jun-Fos complex to the AP-1 site is different in vitro (28Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and the phenotypes of c-jun and c-fos null mutants are different in mammalian embryonic development (29Johnson R.S. van Lingen B.

Nature. 1992; 360: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), we examined the roles of c-Fos in the AP-1 complex in mesoderm formation during Xenopus early embryonic development. Here, we report, for the first time, the microinjection of a heterodimeric AP-1 (c-jun/c-fos) transcription factor causing posteriorized embryos and leading to the induction of mesoderm in ectoderm explants from Xenopus embryos. In addition, we demonstrate that AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos) functions downstream of FGF signaling and is an essential component of the mesoderm maintenance machinery mediated by eFGF/Xbra. Furthermore, we found that FGF induces mesoderm formation and maintenance through the synergistic action of the diversified signals derived from the FGF/Xbra autocatalytic loop. The c-jun cDNA was inserted into pGEM (28Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and c-fos and antisense c-fos were subcloned into the pSP65 vector (32Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant-negative FGF receptor (DN-FR) (7Amaya E. Musci T.J. Kirschner M.W.

Xbra-Engrailed (dominant-negative mutant of Xbra (DN-Xbra)) is a dominant-interfering Xbra generated by replacing the activation domain of Xbra with the repressor domain of the Drosophila Engrailed protein (34Conlon F.L. Sedgwick S.G. Weston K.M. Smith J.C. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2427-2435PubMed Google Scholar). DN-jun was subcloned into the pSP64TEN vector (26Dong Z. Xu R.-H. Kim J. Zhan S.-N. Ma W.-Y.

The constitutively active ras ([Val12]Ha-Ras) and dominant-negative ras (DN-ras; [Asn17]Ha-Ras) cDNAs were inserted into the pSP64 vector (18Whitman M. Melton D.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Each of the cDNAs were linearized and used forin vitro synthesis of capped mRNA using an Ambion transcription kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The synthetic RNA was quantitated by ethidium bromide staining in comparison with a standard RNA. Xenopus laevis embryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization (35Xu R.-H. Kim J. Taira M. Zhan S.-N. Sredni D. Kung H.-f. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Developmental stages were designated according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (36Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. 2nd Ed. North-Holland, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Embryos at the two-cell stage were injected in the animal pole with messenger RNA or cDNA as described in the figure legends. Animal caps were dissected from the injected embryos at stages 8.5–9 and cultured to various stages for further analysis as described in the figure legends. Total RNA was extracted from cultured explants with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed with a Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primer sets and PCR conditions for Xbra, muscle actin, and EF-1α were as described previously (26Dong Z.

After injection, the animal caps were excised from the embryos (stages 8.5–9) and cultured in the presence of different dosages of bFGF (2–100 ng/ml) until stages 10.5 and 13. AP-1-dependent luciferase activity in the animal cap explants was measured after homogenization in lysis buffer as described previously (26Dong Z. Xu R.-H. Kim J. Zhan S.-N. Ma W.-Y. Colburn N.H. Kung H.-f. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9942-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported high levels of AP-1-dependent transactivation activity duringXenopus early embryonic development and inhibition of FGF-induced mesoderm formation in animal cap explants from embryos injected with DN-jun RNA (26Dong Z. Xu R.-H. Kim J. Zhan S.-N. Ma W.-Y. Colburn N.H. Kung H.-f. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9942-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether AP-1 is a target transcription factor of the FGF signal, we performed the following experiments. Embryos were injected with AP-1- or NF-κB-luciferase reporter genes at the two-cell stage. The animal pole tissue was then dissected at stages 8.5–9 and incubated with different dosages of bFGF. The bFGF-treated animal caps were harvested at stages 10.5 and 13, and the luciferase activity in the animal caps was measured. The luciferase activity in the animal caps injected with the NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene was not affected by bFGF (Fig.1 B). On the other hand, the luciferase activity in the animal caps injected with the AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid was increased 2–8-fold by bFGF treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). In separate experiments, AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmids were coinjected with the mRNAs encoding c-Jun and c-Fos, and the luciferase activity was compared with the animal cap explants treated with bFGF. AP-1 RNA (c-jun/c-fos)-injected animal cap explants showed similar luciferase activity as bFGF-treated animal cap explants at stages 10.5 and 13 (Fig. 1 C). The AP-1 activity in FGF-treated animal cap explants was inhibited by DN-ras RNA injection (data not shown), suggesting that FGF signals through the Ras pathway for AP-1 activation. However, AP-1-dependent luciferase activity was not affected in animal cap explants injected with noggin or dominant-negative BMP-4 receptor mRNA (data not shown), which caused neuralization in the ectoderm. The mesoderm-inducing activity of AP-1 (c-jun and c-fos) was then examined by injection of RNA encoding c-Jun and/or c-Fos at the two-cell stage. The animal pole tissue was dissected at the blastula stage (stages 8.5–9) and incubated until the animal cap explants were harvested. Injection of β-galactosidase, c-jun, or c-fos RNA alone or c-junplus antisense c-fos RNA did not induce any morphological changes in the animal cap explants cultured until the tadpole stage (Fig. 2 a, panel A). On the other hand, animal caps from embryos injected with c-jun and c-fos RNAs together showed morphological changes (the animal caps were swollen and elongated) similar to those induced by FGF treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 a, panels B–D). To confirm the mesoderm induction in animal caps, we examined early and late molecular markers for mesoderm by RT-PCR. Xbra, an immediate-early marker for mesoderm, and muscle-specific actin, a late marker for mesodermal differentiation, were expressed in AP-1 (c-jun/c-fos)-injected caps, but not in β-galactosidase, c-fos, or c-jun RNA-injected caps or in c-jun plus antisense c-fosRNA-injected caps (Fig. 2 b). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the animal cap injected with c-jun and c-fos together generated unorganized muscle tissues similar to the tissues generated by treatment with bFGF. Actin was detected by specific antibody to muscle actin in the sections of c-jun- and c-fos-injected animal cap samples and bFGF (100 ng)-treated samples, but not in the other samples (Fig. 2 c). For mesoderm formation, injection of 0.5 ng of c-jun RNA and 0.5 ng of c-fos RNA together was sufficient to induce Xbra at the early stage (stage 11) and muscle actin at the later stage (stage 24) in ectoderm cells. However, animal cap explants injected with up to 4 ng of c-jun alone did not show any detectable morphological changes or increased expression of the mesodermal markers Xbra and actin. A very small amount of Xbra was detected in c-jun-injected animal cap explants as determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 2 d). These results clearly demonstrate that heterodimeric AP-1 (c-jun and c-fos) is sufficient to induce mesoderm in animal cap explants, similar to FGF and its signal molecules, Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase, but homodimeric AP-1 (c-Jun) is not able to induce mesoderm. The previous results (26Dong Z. Xu R.-H. Kim J. Zhan S.-N. Ma W.-Y. Colburn N.H. Kung H.-f. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9942-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) for the AP-1/Jun involvement in FGF-mediated mesoderm induction by loss-of-function assay with DN-jun were possibly caused by the blocking of heterodimeric AP-1 activity. Although we have demonstrated the requirement of both c-Jun and c-Fos for mesoderm formation, it remains to be determined whether the requirement of c-Jun/c-Fos can be replaced by other members of the Jun/Fos families. In the present study, we have focused only on the direct roles of c-Jun/c-Fos. Whole embryos injected with β-galactosidase, c-jun, or c-fos RNA alone at the two-cell stage did not show any morphological changes (data not shown). Another transcription factor (AP-2 RNA) was also injected, and no morphological change was observed (data not shown). However, c-jun and c-fos RNAs injected together caused morphological changes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 a). Embryos injected with AP-1 mRNAs (0.5 ng of c-jun and 0.5 ng of c-fos) at the two-cell stage developed normally through the mid-gastrula stage, but the blastopore closure was delayed (Fig.3 b, panel B). A similar phenotype of abnormal gastrulation defects was observed with injection of other mesoderm inducers, Xbra (0.5 ng) or ras RNA (1 ng) (Refs. 12Northrop J. Woods A. Seger R. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Krebs E. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 33Cunliffe V. Smith J.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholarand data not shown). Injection of low doses of AP-1 RNAs (0.125 ng of c-jun and 0.125 ng of c-fos) caused an enlarged proctodeum at the posterior part of the embryo at the tadpole stage, which is a typical phenotype of CSKA-eFGF plasmid-injected embryos (17Isaacs H.V. Pownall M.E. Slack J.M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4469-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The embryos injected with AP-1 exhibited a posteriorized phenotype with diminished anterior structures including cement gland and forebrain. The extent of morphological changes depends greatly on AP-1 dosages up to 2 ng. Histological analysis showed that unorganized muscle-like structure accumulated in the posterior part of AP-1-injected embryos (data not shown). Interestingly, in animal cap explants excised from embryos coinjected with AP-1 and chordin, posterior neural markers were induced. 2J. Kim and H.-f. Kung, unpublished data. The caudalization of neural tissues with FGF or Xbra has recently been reported (39Cox W.G. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 4349-4358PubMed Google Scholar, 40Taira M. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Xu R.-H. Kim J. Taira M. Sredni D. Kung H.-f. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6892-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that AP-1 is involved in a broad range of FGF activities. Injection of AP-1 RNAs (c-jun and c-fos) into the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) or the ventral marginal zone (VMZ) in embyros at the four-cell stage resulted in different phenotypes (Fig.3 c). Injection of AP-1 into the VMZ caused a minor posterior defect with normal head structure (Fig. 3 c, panel A). However, injection of AP-1 RNAs into the DMZ caused a gastrulation delay and consequently more severe defects in the anterior, including lack of a head structure, but rather normal posterior structure (Fig. 3 c, panel B). While this work was in progress, an implantation experiment with eFGF beads in gastrulas was published (42Pownall M.E. Tucker A.S. Slack J.M.W. Isaacs H.V. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3881-3892PubMed Google Scholar). When an eFGF bead was implanted into the dorsal lip of a stage 11.5 embryo, it resulted in the loss of eyes and forebrain as well as other anterior structures, with a normal proctodeum in the tail bud-stage embryo. However, when an eFGF bead was implanted into the ventral lip at stage 11.5, the embryos developed normally, including the head structure. The results were similar to those of the present study of AP-1 (see above). The similarity in morphological changes further suggests that AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos) may be a mediator in the FGF signaling pathway. AP-1 transactivation activity in animal cap explants was increased by treatment with bFGF in culture media. Furthermore, AP-1 induced mesoderm formation and the expression of Xbra and muscle actin similar to bFGF. These results suggest that AP-1 may be a target molecule of FGF signaling in the nucleus. Although XenopusbFGF produced from the injected mRNA has a potent mesodermalizing effect on animal hemisphere cells, bFGF has no signal sequence that may be necessary for cell-cell signaling events such as mesoderm induction. Furthermore, virtually no phenotypic change by bFGF treatment is observed in intact embryos (43Kimelman D. Mass A. Development (Camb.). 1992; 114: 261-269PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to bFGF, eFGF plays an important role in maintaining the properties of mesoderm in the gastrulas of Xenopus embryos in addition to its mesoderm-inducing activity during the blastula stages. The expression of eFGF increases significantly during gastrulation. In addition, eFGF caused similar morphological changes in whole embryos (posteriorization) as observed with AP-1 mRNA injection. Although Xbra and eFGF have been reported to require each other for mesoderm maintenance (13Schulte-Merker S. Smith J.C. Curr. Biol. 1955; 5: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Isaacs H.V. Pownall M.E. Slack J.M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4469-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), the roles of Ras/AP-1 have not been clearly demonstrated in mesoderm maintenance mediated by eFGF/Xbra. Therefore, it is interesting to test whether signaling components of FGF (Ras/AP-1) are involved in mesoderm maintenance mediated by the FGF/Xbra autocatalytic loop. The injection of Xbra RNA or the CSKA-eFGF plasmid into animal caps caused morphological changes (swelling and elongation) as shown in Fig.4 a. The CSKA-eFGF plasmid becomes transcriptionally active after mid-blastula transition (44Harland R. Misher L. Development (Camb.). 1988; 102: 341-359Google Scholar), and eFGF mRNA does not accumulate until stage 10 (17Isaacs H.V. Pownall M.E. Slack J.M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4469-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The animal cap explants start to lose competence for mesoderm induction in response to bFGF after stage 10. However, the animal cap injected with the CSKA-eFGF plasmid showed a consistently potent mesoderm-forming ability, indicating that the period of competence of ectoderm cells for mesoderm induction might be longer than what is usually expected. Coinjection of RNAs encoding DN-Ras significantly reduced elongation movements of animal cap explants in response to eFGF or Xbra during the gastrulation stages (data not shown), suggesting that maintenance of mesoderm depends on the downstream FGF signal, Ras. As expected, coinjection of DN-jun with Xbra or eFGF inhibited elongation movements similar to DN-ras (Fig. 4 a). Since the maintenance of mesoderm in the gastrulating embryo is crucial for the formation of differentiated mesoderm-like muscle (45Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the expression of muscle actin. Animal caps derived from coinjection of DN-ras or DN-jun with eFGF or Xbra were cultured until the tadpole stage and assayed for muscle actin expression by RT-PCR. Consistent with the morphological data, DN-ras and DN-jun significantly inhibited the expression of muscle actin in animal caps derived from coinjected samples (Fig.4 b). Since Ras/AP-1 activates Xbra expression, and Xbra is able to induce the differentiated mesoderm, it was unclear whether Ras/AP-1 was involved only in mesoderm induction or also in later events after mesoderm induction. The results suggest that Ras and AP-1 are involved in mesoderm maintenance in addition to mesoderm induction. FGF/Ras/AP-1 had an activity to induce an early mesodermal marker, Xbra. While ectopic overexpression of Xbra itself is enough to generate the differentiated mesoderm, Xbra still requires endogenous FGF/Ras/AP-1 signals for mesoderm maintenance and differentiated mesoderm formation. On the other hand, FGF-mediated mesoderm formation and maintenance are dependent on Xbra. Since AP-1 was found to be involved in the mesoderm maintenance machinery mediated by eFGF/Xbra, we examined whether Xbra is required for AP-1-mediated mesoderm formation. AP-1-mediated mesoderm formation was abolished by coinjection of DN-Xbra. DN-Xbra inhibited the expression of muscle actin as well as Xbra itself in animal caps derived from coinjected samples (Fig.5). The RT-PCR product of Xbra shown in Fig. 5 has been designed not to detect injected DN-Xbra. The results indicate that intact Xbra is required for its own expression and mesoderm induction. Furthermore, the effect of DN-Xbra was not reversed by AP-1. Although it remains to be investigated how Xbra regulates its own transcription, we postulate that Xbra is required to keep the mesoderm character of the tissue and that DN-Xbra blocks the competence of the animal cap for mesoderm induction. We extended the mesoderm maintenance machinery of eFGF/Xbra to include Ras/AP-1, and the blocking of one of the components is enough to abolish the machinery of mesoderm formation, suggesting that positive feedback is necessary to maintain mesoderm (see Fig. 7).Figure 7Proposed model for mesoderm formation mediated by the FGF/Xbra autoregulatory loop. Ras/AP-1 is involved in the FGF/Xbra autoregulatory loop, and Xbra is activated by AP-1. Diversified signals derived from each component (FGF/Ras/AP-1/Xbra) of the autoregulatory loop are required for mesoderm induction and maintenance. The blocking of any one component of the loop by the dominant-negative mutants results in the inhibition of mesoderm formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FGF and Xbra require each other for mesoderm formation and maintenance, and the downstream signal molecules of the FGF receptor are involved in these events. However, it is not clear whether FGF signals for mesoderm induction and maintenance through a linear array of signals or through the synergistic action of the diversified signals. These two possibilities were examined by coinjecting an activated form of Ras with DN-FR. Constitutively activeras was coinjected with DN-FR, and the animal cap explants were analyzed. The elongation movement of animal cap explants caused by the overexpression of the constitutively active form of raswas inhibited by coinjection of DN-FR (Fig.6 a). Consistent with morphological data, the expression level of the early mesodermal marker (Xbra) and the differentiated mesodermal marker (muscle actin) was reduced or totally abolished by coinjection of DN-FR (Fig.6 b). This result suggests that Ras-mediated mesoderm formation requires endogenous FGF signaling and that FGF triggers at least two different signals including Ras for mesoderm formation. Consistently, AP-1-induced mesoderm formation was also inhibited by coinjection of DN-FR (Fig. 6 c). Furthermore, AP-1-induced mesoderm formation was inhibited by coinjection of DN-ras(Fig. 6 c). Our results suggest that mesoderm formation induced by FGF signaling is the synergistic action of the diversified signals. Based on these results, a model is proposed. As shown in Fig.7, the signals derived from the FGF/Xbra autocatalytic loop contribute synergistically to the formation of mesoderm. The blocking of any signals by dominant-negative mutants resulted in inhibited mesoderm formation. In this paper, we show, for the first time, that heterodimeric AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos) induces mesoderm formation in animal cap explants of Xenopus embryos. Additionally, we found that eFGF- or Xbra-mediated mesoderm maintenance was dependent on the downstream signals of FGF, Ras, and AP-1. Also, AP-1-mediated mesoderm formation required FGF/ras/Xbra, and Xbra expression was activated by AP-1. Furthermore, we found that FGF induced mesoderm formation and maintenance through the synergistic action of the diversified signals derived from the FGF/Xbra autocatalytic loop. We thank Dr. T.

https://openalex.org/W2063264168,"A system to study the fidelity of internal strand transfer events was constructed. A donor RNA, on which reverse transcriptase (RT)-directed DNA synthesis was initiated, shared homology with an acceptor RNA, to which DNAs initiated on the donor could transfer. The homology occurred over a 119-base internal region of the donor which coded for the N-terminal portion of the α-lac gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify DNA synthesis products. The PCR products were then digested with PvuII and EcoRI and ligated into a vector which had this same region excised. Transformed Escherichia coli were screened for the ability to produce a functional β-galactosidase protein by blue-white phenotype analysis with white colonies scored as those with errors in α-lac. Products synthesized on the donor were used to assess the error rate of human immunodeficiency virus-RT while products transferring to and subsequently extended on the acceptor (transfer products) were used to monitor transfer fidelity. Human immunodeficiency virus-RT made approximately 1 error per 7500 bases copied in the assay. Nucleocapsid protein (NCp), although stimulating strand transfer 3-fold, had no effect on RT fidelity. Transfer products in the absence of NCp had essentially the same amount of errors as donor-directed products while those produced with NCp showed a slight increase in error frequency. Overall, strand transfer events on this template were highly accurate. Since experiments with other templates have suggested that transfer is error prone, the fidelity of strand transfer may be highly sequence dependent.

Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 251-274Google Scholar and 10Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6900-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) are major contributing factors in the generation of diversity. Retroviruses are single-stranded plus sense RNA viruses which go through a double-stranded DNA intermediate during their life cycle (11Varmus H. Swanstrom R. Weiss R. Teich N. Varmus H. Coffin J. RNA Tumor Viruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 369-512Google Scholar). The virion contains two copies of genomic RNA which are not necessarily 100% homologous. Recombination, occurring by a process referred to as strand transfer (also strand switching, template switching, or template jumping), can result in the integration of genetic information from both genomic copies. The resulting provirus codes for new genomic RNA that is a chimera of the parental genomes and, therefore, not identical to either. Strand transfer occurs when DNA synthesized on one template is translocated to another region on the same or a different template. Two such events, the transfer of minus and plus strand strong-stop DNAs, are an integral part of retroviral replication (for a review, see Ref.12Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 49-83Google Scholar). These DNAs are initially synthesized at the 5′ ends of the viral RNA (− strong stop) or minus strand DNA (+ strong stop). Subsequently, each is transferred to a homologous region located at the 3′ end of the respective templates. As a consequence of the diploid nature of retroviruses, strand transfer from internal regions of the RNA genome can also occur during the synthesis of minus strand DNA. Such recombinational events are proposed to occur by a “forced copy choice” mechanism (13Vogt P.K. Sylvestri L. Possible Episomes in Eukaryotes. North-Holland, Amsterdam1973: 35-41Google Scholar, 14Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The forced copy choice model postulates that some viral genomic RNAs are truncated and, therefore, unable to produce a completed copy of minus strand DNA. When DNA synthesis reaches the end of the truncated RNA, the nascent DNA is “forced” to switch to the homologous region of the second copy of genomic RNA within the diploid virion to complete minus strand synthesis. Others have shown that recombination of this type may not require broken RNAs (15Xu H. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 76: 3751-3754Google Scholar). In such a situation, the template switch may not always be forced. A slightly modified version of this model termed “copy choice” could describe all recombinations occurring during minus strand DNA synthesis. Note also that recombination may occur during the synthesis of plus strand DNA as proposed in the “strand displacement-assimilation model” (16Junghans R.P. Boone L.R. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 544-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Skalka A.M. Boone L. Junghans R. Luk D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 294: 75-86Google Scholar). Although reports have suggested that plus strand recombination may occur (18Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), other results have indicated that recombination during the synthesis of minus strand DNA is the predominant pathway (9Hu W.S. Pathak V.K. Temin H.M. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 251-274Google Scholar, 19Hu W.-S. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4457-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Internal strand transfer has been shown to occur both in vivo (20Goodrich D.W. Duesberg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2052-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 22Vartanian J.P.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Models for strand transfer have been proposed although specific details of the mechanism remain unclear (10Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6900-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 24DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that strand transfer may be error prone (26Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This is based on the finding that HIV-RT tends to incorporate additional non-template-directed bases at the 3′ end of a growing DNA strand after reaching the 5′ terminus of the template (26Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 28Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Such events could be particularly relevant to strong stop transfers or forced copy choice type transfers, all of which can happen at template termini. It has also been shown, using an in vitro system designed to test the fidelity of internal transfer within a hypervariable region of the nef gene, that strand transfer was more error prone than RNA-directed DNA synthesis (29Wu W. Palaniappan C. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 9: 1710-1718Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, results using an in vivo system based on Moloney murine leukemia virus suggested that strand transfer was highly accurate (30Zhang J. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2409-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the fidelity of strand transfer using a system in which transfer occurred between RNAs containing homologous sequences from the α region of β-galactosidase. Reverse transcriptase-derived DNA products were PCR-amplified and tested in an α-complementation assay. Errors occurring during RNA-directed DNA synthesis or strand transfer were scored based on the inability of mutated products to complement β-galactosidase activity, resulting in white rather than blue colonies in the assay. Results showed that strand transfer and RNA-directed DNA synthesis were of approximately equal fidelity. The presence of viral nucleocapsid protein (NCp) enhanced strand transfer but had little effect on fidelity. This suggests that transfer on this substrate is a highly accurate process. Taken together with results from others, our work implies that the fidelity of strand transfer may be highly sequence dependent. Recombinant HIV-RT, having properties described (31Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4669-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was graciously provided to us by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). This enzyme had a specific activity of approximately 40,000 units/mg (1 unit of RT is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in 10 min at 37 °C using oligo(dT)-poly(rA) as primer-template). As we have previously reported, the enzyme preparations contained very low levels of single strand nuclease activity (24DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that this activity could be inhibited by including 5 mm AMP in the assays. The AMP, at this concentration, did not affect the polymerase or RNase H activity of the RT (data not shown). Aliquots of HIV-RT were stored frozen at −70 °C and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. HIV-1 NCp was from Enzyco (Denver, Colorado). This 55-amino acid protein corresponded to the p7 portion of HIV-1MN (32Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder II, R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNase (DNase-free), T3 RNA polymerase, calf intestinal phosphatase, rNTPs, and dNTPs were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals. T4 polynucleotide kinase, Sequenase, Klenow polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Taq polymerase and placental RNase inhibitor were from Promega. Restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, or Life Technologies. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Inc. All other chemicals were from Fisher Scientific or Sigma. Radiolabeled compounds were from NEN Life Science Products. Donor template RNA (2 nm, see Fig.2 B), was hybridized to 5′ 32P-labeled primer DNA as described below. This template-primer was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence (as indicated) of 10 nmRNA acceptor template and presence or absence of NCp (2 μm final concentration), in 21 μl of buffer (see below). Four μl of HIV-RT (10 units (approximately 85 nmfinal concentration)) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 80 mm KCl (buffer A) was added to initiate the reactions. Reactions included the following reagents at the indicated final concentrations: 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 80 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA (pH 8), 5 mm AMP, 100 μmZnCl2, 100 μm dNTPs, and 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor. Reactions were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 25 μl of 2 × formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) containing 0.5 μg of RNase (DNase free). Samples were heated to 65 °C for 10 min to digest the RNA and then for 2 min at 90 °C. Samples were electrophoresed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels as described below. Wet gels were exposed to film and transfer or full-length donor-directed product were excised and eluted (24DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some gels were dried and used for product quantitation by phosphoimagery using a Bio-Rad GS-525 PhosphorImager. These assays were performed essentially as described above with the following changes: 1) 5 units of Klenow were used in place of RT; 2) the final [KCl] was 10 mm; 3) AMP was excluded from the reactions. For strand transfer reactions the DNA primer was hybridized to donor RNA by mixing primer:RNA transcript at approximately a 5:1 ratio of 3′ termini in buffer A. The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 5 min then slow cooled to room temperature. Denaturing 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide), containing 7m urea, native 8% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide), and 1% agarose gels were prepared and subjected to electrophoresis as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manuel. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Run-off transcription was done as described in the Promega Protocols and Applications Guide (1989). For the donor template, plasmid pBSΔMCS, prepared as described below, was cleaved with BglI and T3 RNA polymerase was used to prepare run-off RNA transcripts approximately 189 nucleotides in length. For the acceptor template, plasmid pBSΔPvuII1146was cleaved with PvuII and T3 RNA polymerase was used to prepare run-off transcripts approximately 179 nucleotides in length. The transcription reactions were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA was gel-purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, located by ultraviolet shadowing, and recovered as described previously (24DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of recovered RNA was determined spectrophotometrically from optical density. Strand transfer products from reactions performed with acceptor template, or full-length donor-directed products from reactions performed without acceptor, were excised and eluted from denaturing gels as described above. The eluted DNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CCTCTTCGCTATTACGCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCGAATTCGCCCTATAGTGAGTC-3′. The first is identical to the primer used to prime the donor RNA while the second overlaps theEcoRI site on the donor and acceptor (see Fig.2 B). Reactions were performed in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9 at 25 °C), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm dNTP, 100 pm of each primer, and 5 units of Taq polymerase. Thirty-five cycles of 94 °C (1 min), 50 °C (1 min), then 72 °C (1 min) were performed. Products were extracted, precipitated, and digested as described in Fig.2 B. Fifty units of EcoRI per PCR reaction was used and after 1 h, 2.5 units of calf intestinal phosphatase was added and incubation was continued for an additional hour. The calf intestinal phosphatase was inactivated according to the manufacturer's instructions and the DNA was recovered by precipitation. Thirty units of PvuII for 1 h was used to digest each reaction. The samples were then electrophoresed on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel as described above. Products were located by UV shadowing and recovered as described above, and quantitated by spectrophotometry. These products were ligated into vector pBSΔPvuII1146 which had been previously cleaved with PvuII and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, then cleaved with EcoRI. The linear vector was recovered from a 1% agarose gel with a Qiagen gel extraction column. The vector (50 ng) and insert (0.05 pm) were ligated for 16 h at 16 °C in a volume of 10 μl. Two μl of the ligation was used to transform Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue competent cells (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Colonies were analyzed and scored as blue or faint blue or white. For DNA sequencing, mini-preps were prepared from white or faint blue colonies and the DNA was sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing primer was 5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATGA-3′. Both plasmids were derived from pBSM13+ (Stratagene Inc.). Plasmid pBSΔMCS (see Fig. 2 A) was made by cleaving pBSM13+ with EcoRI (position 881) andHindIII (position 932) and filling in both ends with Klenow. After ligation with T4 DNA ligase a transformant containing recircularized plasmid which had lost the portion of the multiple cloning site (MCS) between the EcoRI and HindIII (confirmed by sequencing) was expanded and the plasmid was isolated using a Qiagen Mega-Prep kit. Plasmid pBSΔPvuII1146 was produced through multiple steps as described in Fig. 1. This plasmid has a 7-base pair (1149–1155 of pBSM13+) deletion that disrupts the PvuII site at position 1146, leaving a single site for this enzyme at 764. The templates used to study strand transfer and the plasmids used to make those templates are shown in Fig. 2. The donor RNA (produced from pBSΔMCS (Fig. 2 A), on which RT initiates DNA synthesis, was primed with a specific 20-nucleotide DNA oligonucleotide labeled at the 5′ end with 32P. Extension to the end of the donor would produce a 152-nucleotide product while homologous transfer of the growing DNA to the acceptor (produced from pBSΔPvuII1146) and subsequent extension yields a 199-base product (Fig. 2 B). The region of homology (transfer zone) between the donor and acceptor encompassed 119 bases corresponding to a region of α-lac near the N terminus of this protein. Transfer or full-length donor-directed products were isolated from denaturing polyacrylamide gels (see Fig.3) and used for PCR as described under “Methods.” The products were processed as shown in Fig.2 B (see “Methods” for details). The final 119-base pair product, which was dephosphorylated at the EcoRI cleaved end, was ligated into plasmid pBSΔPvuII1146(Fig. 2 A) which had this same fragment excised and was dephosphorylated at the PvuII-cleaved end. The plasmid and insert were dephosphorylated to decrease the likelihood of ligation products consisting of multiple inserts and/or plasmids. Such products would generally produce white colonies due to the orientation of the ligated products and not the sequence of the insert. After transformation, colony color was analyzed with white or faint blue colonies scored as those carrying plasmids with mutations in the α-lac region. We note that not all mutations will be manifested as white or faint blue colonies. Frameshifts, which disrupt the reading frame of α-lac, are generally detected while base changes that result in amino acid changes may be detected depending on their effect on β-galactosidase activity. Base changes in the wobble base position that do not change amino acids will not be detected. There are several “trivial” ways that the α-lacregions of the transformed plasmids could have been disrupted. These include ligation product multimers, T3 RNA, or Taqpolymerase-derived errors, or contaminating nuclease activities that modified the insert or vector during preparation. In order for the assay to be sensitive enough to calculate HIV-RT-derived errors, it is important that the sum of all these errors be considerably less than the errors derived from HIV-RT. Background mutant colonies resulting from restriction enzyme digests and ligation procedures were estimated by cleaving the PvuII-EcoRI insert from plasmid pBSΔPvuII1146 using the protocol described in Fig. 2 B, and ligating this insert back into the vector as described. Insert prepared in this manner were not subject to errors arising from T3 RNA polymerase, Taq, or RT. Approximately 20,704 colonies were analyzed using this approach and 88 of these were white or faint blue (data not shown). The mutant colony frequency (mutants/total colonies) from this data was 4.3 × 10−3. The error frequency per base was calculated by dividing this value by 99, the number of bases between the primers used for PCR in Fig. 2 B. This is appropriate since the other 20 bases of the 119-base insert, although originally derived from RT in the protocol, would be specified in the insert by the PCR primer binding near the EcoRI site. The background error frequency was 4.3 × 10−5 or 1 error per about 23,000 bases. Note that this is about 7-fold lower than the frequency after HIV-RT synthesis (Table I, second column). However, products produced from HIV-RT were also subject to T3 andTaq polymerase errors. To estimate the contribution of these enzymes to the error frequency we performed RNA-directed DNA synthesis using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Although this enzyme is a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, it can also use RNA as a template (34Loeb L.A. Tartof K.D. Tavaglini E.C. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 242: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The fidelity of this enzyme on RNA was reported to be relatively high, with an estimated error frequency in the 10−6 range (35Ricchetti M. Buc H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also, using Klenow in an α-complementation assay similar to the one employed in this work, Ji and Loeb (8Ji J. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) found that Klenow was at least 4-fold more accurate than HIV-RT. When Klenow was used to reverse transcribe the donor RNA, an error frequency per base of about 1.5 × 10−4 was calculated (see Table I). This frequency is about 50% that calculated with HIV-RT. Therefore, at least half of the errors observed when HIV-RT was used were derived from RT.Table ICompilation of results from three independent experimentsDNA source1-aFull-length refers to DNA products extended to the end of the donor template while transfer products transferred to, and were extended on the acceptor template.

Results were from three experiments.1-c Background is defined as the error frequency obtained from insertion of a “non-mutated” insert which was homologous to the inserts derived from the different DNA sources by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). This frequency was 4.3 × 10−5 or about 1 error per 23,000 bases. In parentheses are the results obtained when the value for Klenow in the second column is used as background (see test).1-d The transfer frequency per base was determined from the length of the transfer zone (119 bases) and the efficiency of transfer (transfer products/full-length + transfer products). The transfer efficiencies − or + NCp were 0.12 and 0.36, repetitively. The reciprocal of these values × 119 is the frequency of transfer per base. Open table in a new tab An autoradiogram from a typical strand transfer experiment is shown in Fig. 3. Full-length donor-directed (F) or transfer products (T) were excised from gels and processed as described under “Methods.” Donor-directed products were taken from assays without acceptor template. The presence of NCp (2 μm) in the reactions stimulated strand transfer about 3-fold. The efficiency of transfer, defined as the amount of transfer product divided by the sum of transfer plus full-length products × 100 ((T/(T + F)) × 100) was about 12% (average of three experiments) without and 36% (average of two experiments) with NCp. Note also that when NCp was used, several of the pause sites (sites on the template where premature termination occurs) evident in the absence of acceptor faded when acceptor was added. This suggests that the paused products are “chased” into transfer products by binding to the acceptor and subsequently being extended (24DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The “chasing” was not observed without NCp although transfer clearly occurred. However, in the presence of higher amounts of acceptor template (40 nm), several of the pause sites decrease in intensity and the level of transfer products increases even in the absence of NCp (data not shown). Others have also shown that the level of strand transfer is proportional to the amount of acceptor (36Luo G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that chasing was not detected in Fig. 3 due to the low level of transfer products without NCp and not because it only occurs in the presence of NCp. The fact that several different paused products appear to transfer suggests that strand transfer occurs from several locations on the template. Transfer and donor-directed products were processed as described in Fig.2 B. Analyses from three independent experiments are shown in Table I. In each experiment, 1500 to several thousand colonies derived from a given DNA source were scored."
https://openalex.org/W1992001397,"Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) from the Sphinx moth, <i>Manduca sexta</i>, is an 18-kDa exchangeable apolipoprotein that reversibly associates with lipoprotein particles. In the absence of lipid, apoLp-III exists as an elongated bundle of five amphipathic α-helices. Upon lipid association, the protein is postulated to undergo a major conformational change, wherein the bundle opens around hinge loop regions, resulting in exposure of its hydrophobic interior. Fluorescence quenching techniques have been employed to study apoLp-III helix topography and spatial arrangement in phospholipid disc complexes and intact lipoprotein particles. Intrinsic fluorescence of the single tyrosine in apoLp-III was exploited to monitor the location of helix 5 in model disc complexes. To investigate other regions of the protein, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce cysteine residues, replacing Asn-40 (helix 2, N40C) or Leu-90 (helix 3, L90C), thereby providing two mutant apoLp-IIIs, each with a single site for covalent attachment of the extrinsic fluorescent probe, <i>N</i>-(1-pyrene) maleimide. In the lipid-free state, pyrene-N40C- and pyrene-L90C-apoLp-III were highly accessible to the negatively charged aqueous quencher KI, yielding<i>K</i> <sub>sv</sub> values of 27.1 and 19.8m<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Upon binding to the surface of a spherical lipoprotein particle, <i>K</i> <sub>sv</sub> values for KI decreased by about 90% for both pyrene-labeled apoLp-IIIs, indicating a significant change in the local microenvironment of the fluorophores. A lesser decrease in <i>K</i> <sub>sv</sub> was observed when the pyrene-labeled apoLp-IIIs were bound to phospholipid disc complexes. When spin-labeled fatty acids 5-doxylstearic acid and 12-doxylstearic acid were used as lipophilic quenchers, tyrosine and pyrene fluorescence were more effectively quenched by 5-doxylstearic acid in both phospholipid bilayer disc complexes and spherical lipoprotein particles. These data provide insight into the spatial topography of apoLp-III α-helices in phospholipid disc complexes and support the concept that interaction with spherical lipoprotein particles results in superficial contact of apoLp-III helical segments with the monolayer surface, providing a basis for its reversible binding ability."
https://openalex.org/W2165367422,"Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that is required for thyroid-specific expression of the thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase genes as well as for lung-specific expression of the surfactant protein A, B, and C and the CC10 and the HNF-3α genes. TTF-1 is a phosphoprotein, and the phosphorylation of TTF-1 has been studied already. However, the kinase(s) that could be responsible for this phosphorylation have not been known. In this paper we report the identification by in-gel kinase assay of a 56-kDa serine/threonine kinase that is able to phosphorylate TTF-1 in thyroid cells.

The pathway in which human MST2 functions is not known; however, it does not appear to involve either mitogen-activated protein kinases such as Erk1 and Erk2 nor the stress-activated protein kinases such as JNK and p38.

The ability of TTF-1 to activate transcription can be down-regulated, as shown by at least two instances in which the TTF-1 protein can be detected and shown to be able to bind DNA, yet no transcription from known TTF-1-dependent promoters can be observed (8Francis-Lang H.

Many transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation through several distinct mechanisms that can affect their DNA binding activity, their transcriptional activity, or their ability to interact with other proteins such as cofactors (10Karin M.

In this paper we identify the rat counterpart of human MST2 as the activity capable of phosphorylating TTF-1 in thyroid cell extracts. Human MST1 and MST2 have been isolated by polymerase chain reaction screen with primers designed to amplify the catalytic domains of serine/threonine kinases. Both MST1 and 2 have been shown to be quite homologous to the yeast Ste20 and Pak enzymes throughout the kinase domain even though MST1 and 2 do not contain the p21 GTPase-binding domains, nor do they share any significant homology with Ste20 or Pak outside the kinase domain (15Creasy C.

Ste20 is a component of the pheromone response pathway in budding yeast and represents the first identified member of a new family of serine/threonine protein kinases (17Leberer E. Dignard D.

Sps1 in yeast is involved in the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that regulates spore formation (24Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J.

The pathway in which MST1 and MST2 function is yet unknown; however, it does not appear to involve either mitogen-activated protein kinases such as Erk1 and Erk2 nor the stress-activated protein kinases such as JNK and p38 (16Creasy C. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We show in this paper that TTF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo by rMST2, thus identifying the first target for this family of kinases. FRTL-5 and FRTL-5 Ha-ras cell lines have been described previously (28Ambesi-Impiombato F. Coon H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 10: 163-172Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, these cells were grown in Coon's modified F-12 medium (Seromed) supplemented with 5% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and six growth factors as described by Ambesi-Impiombato and Coon (28Ambesi-Impiombato F. Coon H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 10: 163-172Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3 Ha-ras (the 44-9-1-1 cell line kindly provided by M. Barbacid) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. H441 cells were cultured in RPMI (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient expression, HeLa cells were plated at 8 × 105/100-mm-diameter tissue culture dish 24 h before transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For stable transfection, FRTL-5 cells were plated at 8 × 105/100-mm-dish 48 h before transfection. 3 h before transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum and growth factors. Selection of positive clones was started 2 days after transfection by adding 300 μg/ml G-418 to the medium. Transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described elsewhere (8Francis-Lang H. Zannini M. De Felice M. Berlingieri M. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To prepare whole cell extract, cells were grown to confluence and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Then, the harvested cells were resuspended in whole cell extract buffer (25 mmHepes at pH 7.7, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell suspension was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was estimated by Bio-Rad protein assay. For the synthesis of wild-type and mutated TTF-1 proteins, Escherichia coli M15 strain was transformed with pQE12-TTF-1 or pQE12-S80, two vectors encoding, respectively, wild-type or mutated TTF-1 fused to a His6 tag at the COOH terminus. For c-Jun synthesis,E. coli BL21(D3) cells were transformed with pMT21, a vector encoding human c-Jun fused to a His6 tag at the COOH terminus, kindly provided by D. Bohmann. Bacteria harboring the recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. AtA 600 = 1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and the incubation continued for 2 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 6,000 rpm in JA-14 rotor (Beckman), then resuspended and lysed in 40 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl. The suspension was sonicated (Branson sonifier macrotip) at setting 6 for 6 × 10 s and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm in JA-20 rotor. The pellet was discarded, and 1 ml of Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen) was added to the supernatant. After an overnight incubation on a rotating wheel at room temperature, a column was filled with the slurry. Columns were washed, and bound proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole according to instructions supplied with the resin. Purified TTF-1, S80, or c-Jun was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and concentrated with Centricon 30 (Amicon). In gel-kinase assays were performed as described by Hibi et al. (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 25–250 μg of whole cell extracts from various cell lines was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was polymerized in the absence (control) or presence of bacterially expressed TTF-1 (25–40 μg/ml), S80 (25–40 μg/ml), c-Jun (40 μg/ml), or myelin basic protein (Sigma, 100 μg/ml). At the end of the procedure, the gel was dried and then subjected to autoradiography or analyzed by an Instant Imager (Hewlett Packard). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers STK-1 (5′-CGGGATCCGGNGARHTNATGGCNGTNAARCARGT-3′) and STK-2 (5′-CGGAATTCVTYNACNAYYTCNGGNSYCATCCARAA-3′), encoding the sense and antisense strands of amino acids GE(I/L/M)MAVKGV and FWM(A/S/T/R/G)PE(V/M/I/)V(D/E/K/N), corresponding to the catalytic domains of serine/threonine kinases (16Creasy C. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), flanked by restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI, respectively, were used to amplify DNA from a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction reaction performed using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and starting from 1 μg of FRTL-5 poly(A)+ RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. A band of about 350 bp was obtained, and one-fourth of the reaction was used for a second round of amplification using the same STK-1 as 5′-primer and STK-3 (5′-CGGAATTCRTTNGCNCCYTTNAYRTCNCKRTG-3′), which encodes the antisense strand of H(R/S)D(V/M/I)KGAN. A polymerase chain reaction was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler (an initial denaturation at 94 °C, 30 amplification cycles of 1 s at 94 °C, 5 s at 35 °C, 15 s at 65 °C followed by 1 min at 72 °C). Two fragments, one of 300 bp and one of 240 bp, were obtained and cloned in pBluescript II (Stratagene), then sequenced using T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia). The sequences were analyzed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Groups programs (Fasta and Gap). A fragment with high homology with human MST2 was used to screen 1 × 106 plaques from a rat thyroid cDNA library λgt11. Two clones encoding a protein kinase were obtained, subcloned in pBluescript II, and sequenced entirely. Total RNA was isolated from confluent cell culture dishes by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (30Adams S. Sobel M. Howard B. Olden K. Yamada K. Crombrugghe B.D. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3399-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). 30 μg of total RNA from the different cell lines was size fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N-plus (Amersham) membrane. The blot was hybridized with a fragment that comprised the entire coding region of rMST2 (nucleotides 81–1574 of the cDNA). This probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 58 °C in hybridization buffer (5 × Denhardt's solution, 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA). The membrane was washed twice for 30 min with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice for 30 min with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 58 °C. The blot was normalized by hybridization with a random primed KpnI/SacI 550-bp fragment of the plasmid pGAPDH1 containing the coding region of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The membrane was exposed overnight at −80 °C with an intensifying screen (Kodak Biomax). 1 μg of pBluescript II containing the cDNA of rMST2 (pBS-rMST2) was transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase and translated using the troponin T-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C, and an aliquot was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After fixation for 20 min with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, the gel was enhanced with an enlightening solution (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed for autoradiography. To construct pHA-rMST2 oligonucleotide primers SHA-1 5′-CCGCGGAATTCCGAGCAGCCGCCGGCGCCC-3′ and SHA-2 5′-CCGCGGAATTCCTCAGAAATTCTGCTGCCT-3′ were used to amplify the rMST2 cDNA from the plasmid pBS-rMST2. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the pECE/HAP vector (31Meloche S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), an SV40-based vector containing a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA). pHA-rMST2 was used both for HeLa and FRTL-5 transfections. 0.5 μg RSV-Neo plasmid (kindly provided by G. Morrone) was added when stable transfectants were sought. 50 μg of whole cell extracts were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) for 3 h at 100 V in a cold room. The blot was then probed with the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) recognizing the HA epitope, and detection was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To identify the kinase(s) responsible for TTF-1 phosphorylation, we have performed an in-gel kinase assay using as a substrate bacterially expressed TTF-1 polymerized in an SDS-polymerase gel. Extracts from various cell lines were resolved on gels that were polymerized in the presence of either TTF-1 or c-Jun (+TTF-1 and +c-Jun in Fig.1, respectively). As a control for bands that could result from autophosphorylation, gels polymerized in the absence of added protein were also used (control in Fig. 1). After electrophoresis, the proteins were renatured in the gel and tested by a kinase assay. The experiment shown in Fig. 1 revealed that a protein kinase, with the apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa, was detected with all extracts used, albeit in variable amounts, in the TTF-1 containing gel (+TTF-1 panel in Fig. 1). The kinase activity was very abundant in FRTL-5 extracts, whereas a little reduction was shown in extracts prepared from FRTL-5 cells transformed by the Ha-ras oncogene. Furthermore, a strong phosphorylation of TTF-1 by extracts from murine fibroblasts NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3 Ha-ras could also be observed, although it was very much reduced in human lung cells (H441) and in HeLa cells. No band of similar size was obtained in the control gel, demonstrating that the 56-kDa band was not caused by autophosphorylation of a protein kinase present in the extracts. JNK2 is a well known kinase of 46 kDa which is able to phosphorylate the transcription factor c-Jun and which was first identified by an in-gel kinase assay (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). To determine if the TTF-1 kinase could be JNK2, we performed an in-gel kinase assay using bacterially expressed human c-Jun as substrate (+c-Jun panel in Fig. 1). The experiment revealed that no c-Jun phosphorylation was observed in rat thyroid cells, whereas it was clearly detected in NIH 3T3 and enhanced in NIH 3T3 Ha-ras as expected (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the kinase able to phosphorylate TTF-1 in thyroid cells is not JNK2. To assess if the activity of the identified TTF-1 kinase could be under hormonal control and to get insights on the pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus which could modulate TTF-1 phosphorylation and, perhaps, its activity in FRTL-5 cells, we starved the cells from serum and/or hormones (thyrotropin and/or insulin) and stimulated them with different treatments capable of activating different signal transduction pathways. We have used okadaic acid, which has been described as activating JNK/SAPKs but not ERKs, and conversely, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which activates ERKs but not JNK/SAPKs (32Cano E. Hazzalin C. Kardalinou E. Buckle R. Mahadevan L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we heat shocked the cells at 42 °C to activate JNK/SAPKs (33Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar) and alternatively cultured them in high salt conditions to activate the p38 osmo-sensing pathway (34Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Hence, we performed an in-gel kinase assay using whole extracts from the differently treated FRTL-5 cells and quantified the bands by an Instant Imager acquisition and analysis (Fig. 2). In all conditions tested we did not observe great changes in TTF-1 phosphorylation. The TTF-1 kinase also appeared to be insensitive to treatments known to induce JNK/SAPK family members, such as heat-shock and anysomycin (data not shown). The extracts were normalized by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). We have shown previously that TTF-1 protein is phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues (14Zannini M. Acebron A. De Felice M. Arnone M. Martin-Perez J. Santisteban P. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2249-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For this reason, to clone the cDNA encoding for the kinase responsible for TTF-1 phosphorylation, degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from highly conserved regions present in the catalytic domains of serine/threonine kinases were used to perform a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction starting from FRTL-5 poly(A)+ RNA. Three of the amplified fragments appeared to encode a kinase, and their sequence comparison with the data base revealed a high homology to the human MST2 gene (15Creasy C. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). One of these fragments was then used to probe a rat thyroid cDNA library. Two phages containing an identical fragment of 2.6 kilobases were isolated, and the insert was subcloned and sequenced. The primary sequence (Fig. 3 A) showed 79% similarity with the cDNA encoding for human MST2. The cDNA contains 1,473 bp of open reading frame encoding a 491-amino acid protein kinase with a predicted molecular mass of ∼56 kDa, which showed 96% identity with the human MST2 protein (Fig. 3 B). A strong Kozak sequence (gcggccatgg) could be identified at the potential initiation codon (35Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and three polyadenylation signals are present in the 3′-untranslated region.Figure 3Sequence of the rMST2 cDNA, structure of the encoded protein, and homology with the human protein.

Total RNA was prepared and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using a probe specific for the entire coding region (nucleotides 81–1574 of the cDNA). A transcript of approximately 3.4 kilobases was observed in the RNA of all the cell lines tested (Fig. 4). In particular, the expression was abundant in the RNAs prepared from FRTL-5 and in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas a reduced expression could be observed in the RNA from the lung cell line H441, and the transcript was detected at only very low levels in HeLa cells. The amount of RNA on the blot was normalized by hybridization with a probe specific for the ubiquitously expressed mRNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Thus we conclude that the pattern of expression observed for rMST2 correlates well with the presence of the kinase activity identified by in-gel kinase assay. To verify if rMST2 was really the kinase responsible for TTF-1 phosphorylation, we generated a vector encoding an HA-epitope tagged rMST2 (HA-rMST2) which was transfected transiently in HeLa cells, where the endogenous TTF-1 kinase activity is barely detectable. We also generated FRTL-5 clones stably transfected with the same expression vector. The expression of HA-rMST2 was detected by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against the HA-epitope (Fig.5 A). Among the few bands detected by the anti-HA antibody we could clearly identify that corresponding to HA-rMST2 by its apparent molecular mass and by its absence in cells transfected with an empty expression vector (Fig.5 A, in FRTL-5 cells, compare clones 3-6, 3-2, and 3-3 with Neo; in HeLa cells compare Trans. with Mock). We next performed an in-gel kinase assay using whole extracts from these transfected cells. It was possible to detect, in addition to the previously observed 56-kDa band, a slightly slower migrating band in all cells shown by Western to express HA-rMST2 (Fig. 5 B). This increase in molecular mass is consistent with the size of the HA epitope. To provide additional evidence for the identity of the 56-kDa protein detected in HeLa cells, rMST2, without HA-tag, was synthesized in a cell-free system and run on a TTF-1 containing gel alongside extracts of HeLa cells either mock transfected or transfected with the HA-rMST2 expression vector. As predicted, in vitro translated rMST2 shows the same mobility as the endogenous 56-kDa band (Fig.5 C). TTF-1 is phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues and in a previous study we have mapped its phosphorylation sites (14Zannini M. Acebron A. De Felice M. Arnone M. Martin-Perez J. Santisteban P. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2249-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine if rMST2 was indeed able to phosphorylate TTF-1 at the same sites, an in-gel kinase assay was performed. We polymerized within the gel either TTF-1 or S80, a mutated version of TTF-1 protein in which the serines in the phosphorylation sites have been mutated to alanines (Fig. 6). This mutant has already been shown to be unable to incorporate inorganic P-32 in in vivo labeling experiments (14Zannini M. Acebron A. De Felice M. Arnone M. Martin-Perez J. Santisteban P. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2249-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracts from FRTL-5 cells (panel A, lanes 1), FRTL-5 cells stable transfected with HA-rMST2 (lanes 2), HeLa cells (lanes 3), and HeLa cells transiently transfected with HA-rMST2 (lanes 4) were resolved on the two gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were renatured in the gels and tested by a kinase assay. The experiment revealed that in the gel where wild-type TTF-1 has been polymerized it was possible to observe rMST2 kinase activity in all the extracts, and in particular it was possible to see the activity of both the endogenous kinase as well as that of the HA-tagged version. On the contrary, in the gel where the S80 protein has been polymerized no kinase activity could be detected. This result strongly suggests that both our cloned cDNA and endogenous rMST2 are able to phosphorylate TTF-1 at the same sites that had been mapped previously in vivo. We report in this paper the cloning of a rat serine/threonine protein kinase that was named rMST2, since sequence comparison demonstrates it to be the rat counterpart of the human MST2 kinase. The human protein kinases MST1 and MST2 share a considerable homology to Ste20 and Pak kinases throughout their catalytic domain. However, the homology is completely lost outside the catalytic domain, and the pathway in which this subfamily of kinases functions is not known. The inability of growth factors, heat shock, or high osmolarity to increase MST2 activity indicates that this kinase does not belong to the signal transduction cascades known to respond to these stimuli, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase or the HOG kinases (16Creasy C. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our data also indicate that rMST2 kinase is insensitive to okadaic acid, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, heat shock, and hormone-induced signaling. Thus its activity seems to be constitutive in thyroid cells. We show, by an in-gel kinase assay, that the transcription factor TTF-1 is in vivo a target for rMST2, thus identifying the first target of MST2 catalytic activity. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that rMST2 is indeed the kinase responsible for TTF-1 phosphorylation. First, there is a correlation between the abundance of rMST2 mRNA and of the amount of kinase activity capable of phosphorylating TTF-1 in the analyzed cell lines. Second, there is correspondence between the molecular weight of TTF-1 kinase activity and the deduced molecular mass of rMST2. Furthermore, we demonstrated, using an HA-tagged rMST2, that a new kinase activity of correspondingly increased molecular mass appeared only in the cells expressing the tagged rMST2. In addition, we were able to show that the cDNA that we have cloned as well as endogenous rMST2 are indeed able to phosphorylate TTF-1 at the same serine residues that had been mapped previously. In fact, when the kinase assay was performed using as a substrate the S80 protein, a mutated version of TTF-1 in which all of the phosphorylated serines had been changed in alanines, we did not observe any kinase activity. The role of phosphorylation in the regulation of TTF-1 properties is still unclear, and previous studies suggested that phosphorylation of TTF-1 may have an important role only in specific cell types (14Zannini M. Acebron A. De Felice M. Arnone M. Martin-Perez J. Santisteban P. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2249-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). rMST2 mRNA and activity were detected in all cell lines analyzed, although at different extents. In this respect it is of interest that the lung cell line H441, when compared for levels of rMST2 with FRTL-5 cells, shows much less activity and lower mRNA concentration. It is stimulating to think that such a reduced level of a protein kinase capable of phosphorylating TTF-1 could be correlated with the ability of this transcription factor to activate different promoters in lung and thyroid. We thank Dirk Bohmann for kindly providing the pMT21 plasmid and Mariano Barbacid for the NIH 3T3 Ha-ras cell line (44-9-1-1)."
https://openalex.org/W2020817314,"We have demonstrated recently that phenylazonaphthol (PAN) allergy-induced hyperpigmentation in brownish guinea pig skin is associated with the concomitant appearance of a melanogenic soluble factor(s) that activates the intracellular signal transduction system, including phosphatidylinositol turnover subsequent to ligand-receptor binding in cultured guinea pig melanocytes. In this study we have purified and characterized the PAN-induced melanogenic stimulating factor (PIMSF) that occurs in allergy-associated hyperpigmented skin. By successive column chromatography on TSK 2000SW, Mono Q, and octadecyl-NPR, the PIMSF was purified to homogeneity with a single band of apparent molecular mass of 7.9 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific bioactivity of PIMSF increased by 5,195-fold over the original skin homogenate. In cultured guinea pig melanocytes, this purified PIMSF had the potential of activating an intracellular signal transduction system such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation and intracellular calcium levels through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor. PIMSF consistently caused a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) to membrane-bound PKC within 5 min of treatment with a return to the basal level after 120 min. The stimulating effects of PIMSF on proliferation and melanization of cultured guinea pig melanocytes were abolished completely by a PKC down-regulating agent (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate). PIMSF was similar in molecular mass to rat growth-related oncogene α (GRO-α; molecular mass of 7.9 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had immunocross-reactivity with GRO-α upon Western immune blotting analysis. Further, the stimulatory effect of purified PIMSF on DNA synthesis of cultured guinea pig melanocytes was suppressed markedly by the addition of anti-rat GRO-α antibody, implying that the PIMSF is apparently identical to GRO-α. These findings suggest that PAN allergy provides a new mechanism of hyperpigmentation in which biological factors such as the GRO-α superfamily generated within allergy-induced skin stimulate melanocytes through activation of the PKC-related signal transduction pathway.

Kawai M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 540-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that specific melanogenic factors produced after a time course of hyperpigmentation due to PAN allergy in brownish guinea pig skin are associated with the induction of epidermal hyperpigmentation by the allergen (2Imokawa G. Yada Y. Okuda M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 482-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biological evidence of signal transduction profiles suggested that melanogenic stimulation induced by PAN allergy is mediated through protein kinase C (PKC) activation within melanocytes by soluble factors secreted during biologic processing subsequent to allergic reaction (2Imokawa G. Yada Y. Okuda M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 482-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Evidence has accumulated demonstrating that chemical mediators such as arachidonic metabolites (3Nordlund J.J. Collins C.E. Rhheins L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 86: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Imokawa G. Tejima T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 92: 296-300Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or growth factor-like substances (5Halaban R. Langdon R. Birchall N. Cuono C. Baurd A. Scott G. Moellmann G. McGuire J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1611-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) secreted during inflammation could be responsible for stimulating the function and population of melanocytes, leading to hyperpigmentation induced by several stimuli including ultraviolet (UV) light. However, few of these mediators are known as intrinsic cytokines responsible for hyperpigmentation in vivo. We demonstrated previously that endothelins (ET) secreted from human keratinocytes act as intrinsic mitogens and melanogens for human melanocytes in UVB-induced melanosis (6Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18352-18357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Imokawa G. Yada Y. Miyagishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24675-24680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Imokawa G. Miyagishi M. Yada Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 32-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, UVA-induced melanosis is associated with other keratinocyte-derived growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), secretion of which is specifically stimulated after exposure of human keratinocytes to UVA (9Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Morisaki N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the paracrine linkage of cytokines between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the epidermis plays a constitutive role in stimuli-induced cutaneous pigmentation.PAN allergy-induced hyperpigmentation clearly differs in its time course from ET or GM-CSF-associated pigmentation such as UVB or UVA melanosis, respectively (1Imokawa G. Kawai M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 540-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Imokawa G. Kawai M. Mishima Y. Motegi I. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1986; 278: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Further, there is no similarity in the chromatographic properties between the relevant cytokines in that the allergy-evoked soluble factor exhibits an apparent molecular mass of about 8–9 kDa estimated by gel filtration, which is distinct from that of ET-1 (2.3–2.7 kDa) or GM-CSF (14.5–15.5 kDa).Aside from studies focusing on the biological effects of exogenously added cytokines on human melanocytes (11Halaban R. Pigment Cell Res. 1988; 1: 18-26Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), studies examining the paracrine linkage of cytokines between keratinocytes and melanocytes would provide new insight into cellular mechanisms involved with intrinsic that which eventually take part in allergy-induced melanosis. Our previous studies (7Imokawa G. Yada Y. Miyagishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24675-24680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Morisaki N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) suggested that different stimuli, including UV irradiation, trigger keratinocytes in various ways to produce and secrete completely different spectra of growth factors. On the other hand, it is likely that melanocytes undergo proliferation and differentiation in a similar fashion when responding to different growth factors secreted from keratinocytes (12Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this study therefore, we have extended our previous work and have purified a 7.9-kDa polypeptide from guinea pig skin, and we have characterized its effects on melanocytes. We identified this factor to be a member of the growth-related oncogene α (GRO-α) family or very close to it. It seems likely that specific melanogenic factors, such as GRO-α, produced in allergic cutaneous inflammation are responsible for the induction of late appearing hyperpigmentation by PAN allergy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAnti-ET-1 and anti-rat GRO-a antibodies were purchased from Immunobiological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Gunma, Japan). Anti-bFGF was obtained from Oncogene Science Inc. (Manhasset, NY). Fetal calf serum and minimal essential medium (MEM) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Other chemicals were of reagent grade.Melanocyte CultureGuinea pig melanocytes were established from the flank skin of newborn brownish guinea pigs. Briefly, epidermal sheets were peeled from the skin after incubation with 1,500–2,000 units/ml dispase at 37 °C for 2 h and at room temperature for another 2 h. The epidermal cells were then dispersed by treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min. The suspension of epidermal cells was filtered through sterilized gauze to remove stratum corneum layers; after centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the suspension was cultured in 250-cm2 Falcon dishes with MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mmnonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mg/ml Fungizone, 16 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and 10 μm cholera toxin. After 24–48 h of primary culture, the medium was replaced with new medium containing 100 μg/ml Geneticin, and the culture was continued for 7–10 days to remove contaminating fibroblasts. After removal of fibroblasts, melanocytes were cultured in medium without Geneticin for 45–60 days with medium exchange every 3 days. For the first 2 months, melanocytes were subcultured by trypsin treatment every week. After the melanocytes began to grow well, melanocyte cultures were carried out in MEM (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mmnonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (MCM) excluding PMA and cholera toxin.Assay of MelanogenesisMelanocytes were cultured in the MCM excluding PMA and cholera toxin for more than 1 week. After trypsin treatment they were seeded into 24-well culture plates at a concentration of 1–2 × 104 cells/ml in the MCM. After a 24-h culture, the medium was exchanged for MEM (without fetal calf serum) supplemented with antibiotics, and fraction samples or purified PAN-induced melanogenic stimulating factor (PIMSF) was added at a 100 μl/ml or 1 ng/ml concentration, respectively. For assay of melanin formation (12Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Imokawa G. Motegi I. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 47-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), [2-14C]thiouracil was diluted in Hanks' solution and added at 0.5 μCi/ml/well in culture for 24 h at 37 °C. Incorporated labeled thiouracil was counted by a liquid scintillation counter after the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS−)) followed by trichloroacetic acid treatment and solubilization with 1 n NaOH. In experiments to measure tyrosinase activity (2Imokawa G. Yada Y. Okuda M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 482-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), l-[3,5-3H]tyrosine was diluted in Hanks' solution and added at 1.0 μCi/ml/well to the melanocyte culture plates. After culture for 24 h, 500 μl of medium was transferred to test tubes into which trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10%. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifugation, these supernatants were subjected to Dowex 50W-X12 (50–100 mesh) ion exchange columns (2 ml) to remove unreacted tyrosine, followed by elution with 1 ml of distilled water. 500 μl of the eluted radioactive water was measured by liquid scintillation counter.DNA SynthesisDNA synthesis of melanocytes was measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (Amersham InH, Bucks, U. K.). Melanocytes were plated in 24-well culture dishes at 1–2 × 104 cells/ml in the MCM excluding PMA and cholera toxin. After a 24-h culture, the medium was exchanged for MEM (without fetal calf serum) supplemented with antibiotics; 50 μl of chromatographic fractions from skin extracts was added to the melanocyte cultures for 24 h at 100 μl/ml concentration, and the cells were pulse labeled with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the last 4 h of the 24-h incubation period. After three washings with PBS(−), the cells were lysed with 2 n NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min and neutralized with an equal volume of 2 n HCl. Acid-insoluble materials were precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, collected on glass microfilters, washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid, once with ethanol, and then dried. Incorporated labeled thymidine was counted by a liquid scintillation counter.Measurement of Mass Contents of Ins(1,4,5,)P3For inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) assay (6Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18352-18357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were seeded in 24-well culture dishes at a density of 3 × 104 cells/ml and cultured in MCM excluding PMA and cholera toxin for 24 h. The media were then aspirated. MEM containing 10 mm LiCl was added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before stimulation with skin extract. The stimulation by skin extract was terminated at the designated times by adding 10% perchloric acid after which the samples were kept on ice for 15 min. After neutralization with ice-cold 1.5 m KOH for 60 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min to remove the KClO4 precipitate. The supernatant samples (100 μl each) were subjected to Ins(1,4,5)P3assay using an inositol trisphosphate assay kit (Amersham) (14Yada Y. Ozeki T. Meguro S. Mori S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1988; 156: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Ins(1,4,5)P3 content was determined quantitatively from a calibration curve by using the binding protein specific for Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3.Measurement of Intracellular Calcium ContentThe melanocytes (2 × 103 cells/dish) were loaded with the calcium indicator Fura-2/AM (2 μm) by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the MCM excluding PMA and cholera toxin. The cultured cells were washed twice with fresh medium and exposed in MEM (without fetal calf serum) to purified PIMSF at a 1 μg/ml concentration. Fluorescence images were obtained at alternating excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm through a SIT vidicon camera and processed using an Argus-200 image analyzer (Hamamatsu Photonics Corp., Hamamatsu, Japan). The calibration of the fluorescent signal in terms of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was performed using digital imaging microscopy as described previously (6Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18352-18357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml 15 h before incubation with 1 μg/ml concentration of purified PIMSF.Preparation of Skin ExtractThe discs of guinea pig skin biopsied by keratotome, mainly consisting of epidermis, were homogenized in a 5-fold volume of ice-cold phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a Polytron homogenizer chilled with ice. After removing unbroken tissues by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant fraction was subjected to further centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min to obtain skin extract for further biochemical assay.Purification of PIMSFAll procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated.TSK 2000SW Column Chromatography1 ml of skin extract was applied to a TSK 2000SW column (21.5 × 600 mm, Toyo Soda, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with PBS. Elution was performed with the same buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml/min, and 1.0-ml fractions were collected under the control of an HRLC Bio-Dimension System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Melanogenic and proliferative activities of each fraction were evaluated for a 24-h incubation period at a 100 μl/ml concentration according to the methods described above, and active fractions were pooled.Mono Q Ion Exchange Column ChromatographyThe pooled active fractions were applied to a Mono Q ion exchange column (HR 10/10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 160 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min with an increasing NaCl gradient from 0 to 1.0 m over 30 min, using the HRLC Bio-Dimension System. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected, assayed as above, and active fractions were pooled.Octadecyl-NPR Column ChromatographyThe active fractions obtained from the Mono Q column were applied to an octadecyl-NPR column (HR, Toyo Soda). The proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with an increasing acetonitrile (containing 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid) gradient of 0–100% over 30 min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed as above. The active fractions were pooled and were dialyzed for 20 h against 2 liters of 160 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The dialyzed active samples were concentrated to about 0.5–0.8 ml in Centricon 3 (Amicon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA).Mono Q Ion Exchange Column RechromatographyThe concentrated active fractions were applied to a Mono Q ion exchange column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 160 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with an increasing NaCl gradient of 0–1.0 mover 30 min, using the HRLC Bio-Dimension System. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed as above, and active fractions were pooled.TSK 2000SW Column RechromatographyThe active fraction obtained from the Mono Q column was applied to a TSK 2000SW column (7.5 × 600 mm) equilibrated with PBS. Elution was performed with PBS at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, and 0.3-ml fractions were collected and assayed. Active fractions were pooled.Measurement of PKC Activity and TranslocationThe cultured melanocytes were incubated in MEM (without fetal calf serum) with purified PIMSF at 37 °C for the times indicated, washed twice with cold PBS, and scraped from the culture dishes. The cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × gand resuspended in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (14Yada Y. Ozeki T. Meguro S. Mori S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PKC activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into histone H-1 (type III-S) as described (14Yada Y. Ozeki T. Meguro S. Mori S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Other MethodsAnalytical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed by the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) in 5–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels. For Western immunoblotting analysis, purified proteins as detailed before were separated on 5–20% gradient SDS gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane sheets or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.) and incubated with primary antibodies (1/1,000 dilution). Subsequent visualization of antibody binding was carried out with an ABC kit (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kits with bovine serum albumin as the standard.DISCUSSIONRecent studies suggest that paracrine linkage between melanocytes and surrounding cells in skin tissue such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts plays an important role in stimulating proliferation and melanogenesis of melanocytes, leading to epidermal hyperpigmentation (5Halaban R. Langdon R. Birchall N. Cuono C. Baurd A. Scott G. Moellmann G. McGuire J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1611-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 7Imokawa G. Yada Y. Miyagishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24675-24680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Morisaki N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes and fibroblasts have been shown to secrete potent melanogenic stimulants for melanocytes in response to several stimuli, including chemicals, cytokines, and UV light (17Imokawa G. Yada Y. Morisaki N. Kimura M. Hori Y. Hearing V.J. Nakayama J. Melanogenesis and malignant melanoma: Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1996: 35-48Google Scholar). These findings provide us with deeper insights into the biological mechanisms of epidermal hyperpigmentation, especially those induced by UVA and B. We have recently identified ET-1 (7Imokawa G. Yada Y. Miyagishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24675-24680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GM-CSF (9Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Morisaki N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as important melanogenic stimulants for UVB- and UVA-induced melanosis, respectively. However, little is known about biological mechanisms involved in hyperpigmentation induced by allergic inflammation because no related paracrine or autocrine melanogenic factors have been identified. In the case of UV-induced epidermal hyperpigmentation, we used a co-culture system consisting of melanocytes as responders and UV-irradiated keratinocytes as stimulators to detect secreted cytokines in keratinocytes after UV exposure and to determine intrinsic paracrine cytokines in melanocytes by neutralizing antibodies (7Imokawa G. Yada Y. Miyagishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24675-24680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Morisaki N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, because allergic inflammatory processes could not be substantiated in such a culture system, we have attempted to isolate melanogenic factors from allergen-evoked skin tissue through bioassay of their melanogenic stimulation of cultured melanocytes. We demonstrated previously that PAN-induced late appearing hyperpigmentation in brownish guinea pig skin was associated with the specific appearance of an epidermal melanogenic soluble factor(s), which activates intracellular signal transduction through ligand-receptor interaction (2Imokawa G. Yada Y. Okuda M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 482-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have now purified and characterized that PIMSF from hyperpigmented skin extracts. The PIMSF was purified to apparent homogeneity and shows a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 7.9 kDa upon SDS-PAGE. The PIMSF was similar in molecular profile to rat GRO-α (molecular mass of 7.9 kDa) (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) upon SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting analysis revealed consistently that the purified PIMSF cross-reacted with an anti-GRO-α antibody and that the bioactivities of PIMSF could be abrogated by the addition of anti-GRO-α antibody. These findings suggest that purified PIMSF is identical to GRO families or is very closely related to them. Similarity of the purified PIMSF to the GRO protein is also corroborated by their comparable cellular effects, including their signal transduction profiles such that both induced a marked stimulation of DNA synthesis in cultured guinea pig melanocytes at similar concentrations, accompanied by release of inositol trisphosphate and intracellular calcium mobilization, which was in turn followed by PKC translocation (18Richmond A. Lawson D.H. Nixon D.W. Stevens S. Chawla R.K. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that melanogenic stimulation induced by PAN allergy is mediated by GRO-α secreted during biological processes subsequent to cutaneous allergic reaction.GRO was identified originally as melanoma growth-stimulating activity for its ability to induce proliferation of human melanoma Hs294T cells (19Castor C.W. Miller J.W. Walz D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); it is a member of a gene family encoding secretory proteins associated with the inflammatory response (20Luster A.D. Unkeless J.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1985; 315: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 21Walz A. Peveri P. Aschauer H. Baggioline M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Structurally, GRO is related to a group of inflammatory proteins which includes interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet factor 4, and β-thromboglobulin (22Derynck R. Baalentien E. Han J.H. Thomas H.G. Wen D. Samantha A.J. Zachariae C.O. Griffin P.R. Wong W.L. Matsushima K. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10225-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to stimulate the proliferation of melanoma cells (19Castor C.W. Miller J.W. Walz D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), GRO has a variety of other biological effects including the ability to act as a neutrophil chemotactic factor (23Moser B. Schumacher C. von Tscharner V. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10666-10671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to induce calcium mobilization in a variety of different target cells (18Richmond A. Lawson D.H. Nixon D.W. Stevens S. Chawla R.K. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar). These biological relationships suggest that GRO may also have a function in the inflammatory response. This report demonstrates for the first time the ability of GRO-α to stimulate proliferation and melanogenesis of cultured melanocytes. This provides in vivo validation that keratinocytes, through GRO-α production and secretion, may play an important role in epidermal pigmentation. It has been reported that GRO-α mRNA is expressed in cultured human keratinocytes and that its expression is stimulated in response to UVB exposure (24Venner T.J. Sauder D.N. Feliciani C. Mckenzie R.C. Exp. Dermatol. 1995; 4: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or to IL-1α treatment (25Kojima T. Cromie M.A. Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. Elder J.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 767-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis, GRO-α mRNA is overexpressed selectively in the epidermis as a keratinocyte response to activated T cells (25Kojima T. Cromie M.A. Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. Elder J.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 767-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, human foreskin fibroblasts express a 10-fold elevation in their steady-state levels of GRO mRNA in response to serum or PMA stimulation (26Anisowicz A. Zajchowski D. Stenman G. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9645-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that IL-1 induces at least a 100-fold elevation of GRO mRNA expression"
https://openalex.org/W2052184780,"Transcription of the gene for malic enzyme in chick embryo hepatocytes is stimulated about 30-fold by triiodothyronine (T3). T3 responsiveness is mediated by seven direct repeat hexamers that resemble T3 response elements (T3REs); these elements are located far upstream in the 5′-flanking DNA (Hodnett, D. W., Fantozzzi, D. A., Thurmond, D. C., Klautky, S. A., MacPhee, K. G., Estrem, S. T., Xu, G., and Goodridge, A. G. (1996) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 334, 309–324). In transiently transfected hepatocytes, single copies of six of these elements conferred varying degrees of T3 responsiveness to linked reporter genes. In gel electrophoretic mobility shift analyses, the T3REs bound retinoid X receptor (RXR)-T3 receptor (TR) heterodimers and non-RXR/TR factors present in nuclear extracts prepared from hepatocytes. Binding of the non-RXR/TR factors was specific to individual T3REs and was unaffected by antibodies to TR or RXR. Mutagenesis of binding sites for proteins specific for T3REs 2–5 altered binding of the proteins and T3 responsiveness. These factors appear to bind to and alter function of T3REs without binding directly to TR, differentiating their actions from other TR cofactors; they were tentatively characterized as co-repressors, inhibitors, and activators of T3RE function. Together with RXR and TR, they modulate T3 responsiveness of the gene for chicken malic enzyme.

Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.-S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TR binds to thyroid hormone response elements (T3REs) in the regulatory regions of T3-responsive genes. T3REs consist of pairs of hexameric repeats organized as palindromes, everted repeats or direct repeats, or as extended single copies of the hexamer (2Glass C.K. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). In the consensus hexameric T3RE half-site, RGGWMA, guanosines in positions II and III of the hexamer are critical for DNA-protein interactions (3Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M.

TR is a member of the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors and interacts in solution with itself and other family members to form dimers that bind to the T3RE (6Forman B.M. Casanova J.

Heterodimers of retinoid X receptors (RXR) and TR bind to T3REs with higher affinity and transactivate more effectively than TR/TR homodimers (9Hallenbeck P.L. Marks M.S. Lippoldt R. Ozato K.

Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). The RXR/TR heterodimers bind to direct repeat T3REs with defined polarity; RXR and TR bind to the upstream and downstream half-sites, respectively (11Mader S. Chen J.-Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 12Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). RXR/TR dimers require a 4-bp spacer region between the half-sites (12Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 13Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the half-sites and flanking DNA and the spacing of the half-sites influence binding of the RXR/TR heterodimers and their interactions with other proteins. Consequently, the structure of the T3RE influences the transactivation potential of the bound heterodimer (4Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

However, the mechanisms by which the transactivation signal is transmitted to the basal transcription machinery and by which T3-dependent transactivation is modulated by other factors remain poorly understood. Several cDNAs have been cloned using strategies that rely on the ability of the encoded proteins to bind to TR and RXR; the proteins encoded by these proteins may be involved in transmission of the transactivation signal. In the absence of T3, co-repressors such as silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (18Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) and NCoR (19Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K.

Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). CREB-binding protein and p300 bind to RXR and function as bridging proteins between components of this and other signal transduction pathways (25Hanstein B. Eckner R. DiRenzo J. Halachmi S. Liu H.

Similar bridging proteins (TAFII40 and TAFII110) are present in Drosophila tissues; this nonvertebrate also expresses transcription factors that belong to the steroid/thyroid superfamily of receptors (27Mlodzik M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15066-15070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These and other reports suggest that the binding of such proteins to RXR and TR influences transactivation. Understanding of the binding of TR and RXR to T3REs is based primarily on studies that use characterized response elements and bacterially expressed or in vitro translated proteins. Functional analyses have used a variety of cell lines, many of which are normally unresponsive to T3. These experiments have profoundly increased our understanding of the mechanisms by which T3 regulates transcription. Nevertheless, results of functional analyses are sometimes consistent with results of in vitro binding experiments and sometimes not. Binding may not correlate with function, and functions deduced from experiments with one cell line may differ from those deduced from experiments using a different cell line. To determine physiologically relevant mechanisms, we must use T3REs of natural genes and test hypotheses about binding and function in physiologically relevant cell systems. The gene for chicken malic enzyme is an appropriate model system for testing hypotheses about the relationship(s) between function of T3REs and binding of proteins directly to T3REs, to flanking DNA, or to T3RE-bound receptors. Malic enzyme is involved in the de novo synthesis of long chain fatty acids and responds to nutritional and hormonal signals in intact animals (29Goodridge A.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); these responses can be mimicked by manipulating the hormone and fatty acid milieu of chick-embryo hepatocytes in culture (30Goodridge A.G.

In hepatocytes transfected with chimeric genes containing 5′-flanking DNA of the malic enzyme gene linked to the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), a robust T3-induced increase in CAT activity is elicited without overexpressing TR or other protein (31Salati L.M.

The gene for chicken malic enzyme contains at least six putative T3REs; five are clustered in a 130-bp T3 response unit (T3RU) (32Hodnett D.W. Fantozzzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The T3RU is centered about 3.8 kilobase pairs upstream of the start site for transcription and is complemented by an additional T3RE that is about 800 bp downstream of the T3RU. These T3REs resemble degenerate DR4-type elements; their contributions to T3 responsiveness of the T3RU vary considerably (32Hodnett D.W. Fantozzzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G.

We report here that, in addition to the nucleotides within the half-sites, nucleotides flanking each T3RE play critical roles in defining the differential function of each T3RE; they appear to do so by binding novel proteins.

Fragments of chicken malic enzyme DNA containing putative regulatory sequences were inserted into the multiple cloning site 5′ to the virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in pBLCAT2. A double-stranded herpes simplex polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragment (ME−3903/−3703) was subcloned into the SphI and BamHI sites of pTKCAT to generate p[ME−3903/−3703]TKCAT (pT3RU-TKCAT) (32Hodnett D.W. Fantozzzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments of DNA were subcloned into theHindIII and BamHI sites of pTKCAT to make p[ME−3474/−2715]TKCAT. Most of the TKCAT plasmids containing individual T3REs were constructed by inserting annealed complementary 36-bp oligonucleotides into the corresponding restriction sites of pTKCAT. T3RE 7 was subcloned into the HindIII andBamHII sites of pTKCAT, so that the insertion sites were the same as those in p[ME−3474/−2715]TKCAT. Synthetic oligonucleotides were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to annealing and ligation. Structures of the resulting plasmid DNAs were confirmed by restriction mapping and partial sequence analyses. Hepatocytes were isolated from livers of 19-day-old chick embryos; suspended in Waymouth medium MD 705/1 supplemented with penicillin (60 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), insulin (50 nm), and corticosterone (1 μm); and incubated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes at 40 °C in 5% CO2 in air (34Baillie R.A. Klautky S.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected 20 h after plating, using 40 μg of LipofectACETM/plate. Each plate contained 5 μg of plasmid DNA: pTKCAT (1 μg) or the molar equivalent of other test constructs, pRSV-LUC (0.5 μg), and pBluescript KS+ (balance). Transfection medium was removed at 24 h and replaced with the medium described above, with or without 1.6 μm T3. For each treatment, cells from two plates were combined and harvested at 48 h after adding T3, lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing, and analyzed for protein content (35Sedmark J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar), luciferase (36deWet J.R. Wood K.V. de Luca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1.1-16.20Google Scholar) activities. Cell lysates to be used for CAT assays were heat-treated for 30 min at 60 °C; denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. CAT activity was normalized to protein in the unheated extracts (CAT activity/μg of protein/15 h) and then corrected for transfection efficiency. Statistical significances of differences were determined by the Wilcoxon signed rank test (38Conover W. Practical Nonparametric Statistics. 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). S.E. values are provided to indicate the degree of variability. Each oligonucleotide probe contained a 5′-extension and was labeled by a fill-in reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of E. coliDNA polymerase I. Probes were purified over BioSpin-6 columns. Blunt-ended, double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were the same lengths as the corresponding labeled probes. Nuclear extracts were prepared from chick embryo hepatocytes incubated for 48 h with insulin and corticosterone, plus or minus T3 for 24 h. Extracts were prepared in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.42 m NaCl, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 mm), benzamidine (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (0.7 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1.1-16.20Google Scholar). Chicken TRα protein was expressed inE. coli and purified by heparin-agarose column chromatography (6Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 7 μg of nuclear protein, 0.3 ng of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled double-stranded DNA (30 nt), 2 μg of poly(dI/dC), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.8 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol (v/v) plus or minus competitor DNA in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, after which antibody, if any, was added, and the reaction was incubated for another 15 min. DNA-protein complexes were subjected to electrophoresis in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 18 mA in 110 mm Tris base, 110 mm boric acid, and 2.4 mm EDTA at 4 °C. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C for 16 h. In one experiment, 25 mm Tris base, 0.19 m glycine, 1 mm EDTA buffer was used instead of the Tris borate buffer (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1.1-16.20Google Scholar) (noted in figure legend). Individual putative T3REs were subcloned into pTKCAT and transfected into hepatocytes to determine how much T3 responsiveness each T3RE would confer when it lacked the context of the entire T3RU (Fig. 1). T3RE 2 (32Hodnett D.W. Fantozzzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and putative T3RE 5 bestowed large inductions by T3 and conferred basal levels that were 90 and 50% lower, respectively, than that of the entire T3RU. Cells transfected with putative T3REs 3, 4, and 6 showed small but statistically significant responses to T3, but they did not show significant reductions in basal activity vis à vis the entire T3RU. Putative T3RE 7 conferred an induction by T3 that was similar in magnitude to that conferred by the −3474 to −2715 bp region. Thus, in addition to T3RE 2, putative T3REs 3–7 are authentic T3REs with varying abilities to confer T3 responsiveness to linked genes. Interestingly, T3 responsiveness for T3RE 5 was higher than that for a larger DNA fragment that contained T3REs 4, 5, and 6 (results not shown), suggesting that factors other than TR are involved in T3 responsiveness of the entire T3RU. Several mechanisms could explain the differences in T3 responsiveness bestowed by the various T3REs. First, sequence-dependent differences in binding affinities of the different T3REs for TR/TR homodimers or RXR/TR heterodimers could influence responsiveness. Second, some T3REs may bind TR/TR homodimers and others RXR/TR; the latter should elicit greater responsiveness. Third, the binding of heterodimers to T3REs may induce sequence-dependent structural changes in TR/TR or RXR/TR complexes which, in turn, alter affinity for a bridging factor. Fourth, non-TR proteins may compete for the site that binds TR/TR or RXR/TR dimers; sequence-dependent affinity of the T3REs for such proteins may control the extent of binding of TR to the T3RE. Fifth, non-TR proteins may bind near or adjacent to TR/TR or RXR/TR dimers and regulate the transactivation activity of bound TR. These hypotheses were tested by assessing binding of nuclear proteins to wild-type and mutant T3REs and promoter function of constructs containing the same wild-type and mutant sequences. Each T3RE bound monomeric and dimeric TRα that had been partially purified fromE. coli transformed with an expression vector for chicken TRα (results not shown). Nuclear proteins from T3-treated hepatocytes also bound to each T3RE (Fig. 2). Antibodies (IgG) to either cTRα or cRXR caused the same two closely spaced complexes to be supershifted, indicating that they contained both TR and RXR (bracketed in Fig. 2). Proteins that bind to TR or RXR also should be supershifted by TR or RXR antibodies. Thus, binding of TR accessory proteins, TR-interacting proteins, or integrator proteins to RXR/TR heterodimers may account for the two closely spaced bands (24Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D.

Alternatively, the two complexes may contain RXR and/or TR of different sizes. These results suggest that binding of TR/TR homodimers, as opposed to RXR/TR heterodimers, is not responsible for the weak functional activities of T3REs 3, 4, 6, and 7. Unlabeled fragments containing each of the T3REs and DR4 competed for RXR/TR complexes when tested against each labeled T3RE (Fig.3). When T3RE 3 was the probe, unlabeled T3REs 2, 4, and 5 competed less effectively for RXR/TR than unlabeled T3RE 3, suggesting that affinity of the weak T3RE 3 for RXR/TR may be higher than those of the strong T3REs 2 and 5. Thus, differing affinities of the T3REs for RXR/TR may not cause the differences in responsiveness to T3. Antibodies to TR or RXR did not supershift or inhibit binding of all complexes bound to the T3REs; additional factors bound to each T3RE but did not form stable complexes with RXR/TR (Figs. 2 and 3,A–E). Migration patterns of the non-RXR/TR complexes formed with T3RE 2 were similar to those formed with T3RE 3 or 4 but different from those with T3REs 5 or 7, and that with T3RE 5 was different from that with T3RE 7. The non-RXR/TR complex(es) bound to each T3RE appeared to be specific for that T3RE. Competitions of DNA-protein complexes with a 100–500-fold molar excesses of the other T3REs failed to displace, or displaced poorly, the non-RXR/TR complexes on nonidentical T3REs. These results suggest that different non-RXR/TR proteins bind to each of the T3REs. The pattern of migration of the non-RXR/TR proteins and competition for binding of non-RXR/TR proteins by the various T3REs were similar for T3REs 5 and 6. Furthermore, T3REs 5 and 6 contain 21 bp of overlap. T3RE 5, however, bestowed a much higher T3 responsiveness to transfected cells than T3RE 6. A series of binding and transfection experiments suggested that only one of these two DR4 elements is functional in the natural gene (results not shown). No additional analyses of T3RE 6 are reported in this study. Medium containing T3 affected binding and migration of the non-RXR/TR complexes with some of the T3REs. For T3REs 2 (results not shown) and 4 (Fig. 3 B), the migration patterns and extents of binding of non-RXR/TR complexes to each T3RE were similar in extracts prepared from cells incubated with or without T3. In contrast, for T3REs 3, 5, and 7 (Fig. 3, C–E), major non-RXR/TR binding complexes were formed when the nuclear extracts were from hepatocytes not treated with T3; these complexes were absent in extracts prepared from T3-treated cells. Antibodies to TR and RXR did not supershift non-RXR/TR complexes in extracts prepared from cells that were not treated with T3, confirming that these complexes did not bind to TR or RXR under these conditions. T3RE 7 also bound non-RXR/TR complexes that formed in extracts prepared from T3-treated cells, but not, or less so, in those from cells not treated with T3. In sum, the non-RXR/TR complexes appear to contain factors that are specific for the elements to which they bind; binding of these factors may contribute to the differences in T3 responsiveness and basal activities of cells transfected with TKCAT linked to the different T3REs. T3 in the medium caused a slight increase in the mobility of complexes formed between most of the T3REs and RXR/TR (Fig. 3). A similar phenomenon has been reported previously (42Yen D.M. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23248-23252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For most of the T3REs, the extent of binding of RXR/TR was unaffected by T3. For T3RE 7, however, increased binding of RXR/TR in extracts from T3-treated cells was correlated with decreased binding of one of the non-RXR/TR complexes. At this T3RE, RXR/TR and one of the non-RXR/TR proteins may bind to the same site and compete with one another for binding to the site in a T3-dependent manner. A gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay that used a high ionic strength buffer permitted resolution of the slowly migrating complex containing T3RE 5 into two distinct bands (Fig.4 C). The mutations in mD reduced binding of RXR/TR to T3RE 5 because they destroyed the downstream half-site of T3RE 5 (Fig. 4 B). In addition, however, they reduced binding of protein (NP5) in the more slowly migrating of the two non-RXR/TR complexes. Formation of this complex may be dependent on binding of RXR/TR to the T3RE. The mutations in m3′ also reduced binding of NP5 (Fig. 4 C), but they had no effect on binding of RXR/TR (Fig. 4 B). Mutant m3′ of T3RE 5 was introduced into the TKCAT vector (p5 m3′[ME−3794/−3769]TKCAT) to characterize function of NP5 (Fig.4 D). This mutation caused a significant decrease in T3 responsiveness. The decrease was due entirely to elevated basal activity. The NP5 binding activity was present only in extracts made from hepatocytes that were not treated with T3. This suggests that the binding of NP5 to T3RE 5 may contribute to the silencing function of TR. Mutant forms of T3RE 2 were linked to TKCAT (Fig.5 A), and their promoter activities were tested. Mutation of the 5′-flanking region did not reduce T3 responsiveness significantly compared with that of wild-type T3RE 2 (Fig. 5 B). Mutation of the spacer region (2mS) reduced (by 93%) but did not eliminate T3 responsiveness. Mutation of the 3′-flanking region (2m3′) increased T3 responsiveness by almost 5-fold. Mutations that caused a change in response to T3 did not change basal activity. Thus, the sequences flanking the downstream half-site are important for the characteristic response of T3RE 2 to T3. Mutation of the upstream half-site (2mU) had no effect on binding of the novel protein specific for T3RE2 (NP2). Mutation of any other region of T3RE 2, including the 3′-flanking region, inhibited binding of NP2 (Fig. 5"
