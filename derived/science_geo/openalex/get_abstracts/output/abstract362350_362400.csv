https://openalex.org/W1982084822,"In an adaptive immune response, naive T cells proliferate during infection and generate long-lived memory cells that undergo secondary expansion after a repeat encounter with the same pathogen. Although natural killer (NK) cells have traditionally been classified as cells of the innate immune system, they share many similarities with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We use a mouse model of cytomegalovirus infection to show that, like T cells, NK cells bearing the virus-specific Ly49H receptor proliferate 100-fold in the spleen and 1,000-fold in the liver after infection. After a contraction phase, Ly49H-positive NK cells reside in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs for several months. These self-renewing 'memory' NK cells rapidly degranulate and produce cytokines on reactivation. Adoptive transfer of these NK cells into naive animals followed by viral challenge results in a robust secondary expansion and protective immunity. These findings reveal properties of NK cells that were previously attributed only to cells of the adaptive immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2064469303,"Recurrent gene fusions, typically associated with haematological malignancies and rare bone and soft-tissue tumours, have recently been described in common solid tumours. Here we use an integrative analysis of high-throughput long- and short-read transcriptome sequencing of cancer cells to discover novel gene fusions. As a proof of concept, we successfully used integrative transcriptome sequencing to 're-discover' the BCR-ABL1 (ref. 10) gene fusion in a chronic myelogenous leukaemia cell line and the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in a prostate cancer cell line and tissues. Additionally, we nominated, and experimentally validated, novel gene fusions resulting in chimaeric transcripts in cancer cell lines and tumours. Taken together, this study establishes a robust pipeline for the discovery of novel gene chimaeras using high-throughput sequencing, opening up an important class of cancer-related mutations for comprehensive characterization."

https://openalex.org/W2075183590,"Thomas Sander and colleagues identify 15q13.3 microdeletions in 1% of individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). The majority of these individuals do not show intellectual disability, schizophrenia or other neuropsychiatric phenotypes, thus extending the phenotypic spectrum associated with 15q13.3 microdeletions. We identified 15q13.3 microdeletions encompassing the CHRNA7 gene in 12 of 1,223 individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), which were not detected in 3,699 controls (joint P = 5.32 × 10−8). Most deletion carriers showed common IGE syndromes without other features previously associated with 15q13.3 microdeletions, such as intellectual disability, autism or schizophrenia. Our results indicate that 15q13.3 microdeletions constitute the most prevalent risk factor for common epilepsies identified to date."
https://openalex.org/W2018387247,"Dysregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with a variety of diseases, including colorectal cancer. By comparing more than 200 miRNAs in 13 pairs of matched colorectal cancer and normal adjacent tissue samples through qRT-PCR and microarray analysis, we found a widespread disruption of miRNA expression during colorectal tumorigenesis. In particular, among a panel of presumed targets generated by in silico analysis that may interact with these aberrantly expressed miRNAs, KRAS oncogene has been further experimentally validated as the target of miR-143. First, an inverse correlation between KRAS protein and miR-143 in vivo was found. Second, KRAS expression in Lovo cells was significantly abolished by treatment with miR-143 mimic, whereas miR-143 inhibitor increased KRAS protein level. Third, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-143 directly recognize the 3′-untranslated region of KRAS transcripts. Four, Lovo cells treated with miR-143 inhibitor showed a stimulated cell proliferation, whereas miR-143 overexpression had an opposite effect. Finally, inhibition of KRAS expression by miR-143 inhibits constitutive phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Taken together, the present study provides the first evidences that miR-143 is significant in suppressing colorectal cancer cell growth through inhibition of KRAS translation."

https://openalex.org/W2066386560,"Pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) and mature BDNF utilize distinct receptors to mediate divergent neuronal actions. Using new tools to quantitate endogenous BDNF isoforms, we found that mouse neurons secrete both proBDNF and mature BDNF. The highest levels of proBDNF and p75 were observed perinatally and declined, but were still detectable, in adulthood. Thus, BDNF actions are developmentally regulated by secretion of proBDNF or mature BDNF and by local expression of p75 and TrkB."
https://openalex.org/W2063753583,"The authors report that rats that were withdrawn from cocaine self-administration had an in vivo deficit in their ability to develop long-term potentiation and depression in the nucleus accumbens core following prefrontal cortex stimulation. N-acetylcysteine, a drug that prevents relapse, restored the ability to induce plasticity. Cocaine addiction is characterized by an impaired ability to develop adaptive behaviors that can compete with cocaine seeking, implying a deficit in the ability to induce plasticity in cortico-accumbens circuitry crucial for regulating motivated behavior. We found that rats withdrawn from cocaine self-administration had a marked in vivo deficit in the ability to develop long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the nucleus accumbens core subregion after stimulation of the prefrontal cortex. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment prevents relapse in animal models and craving in humans by activating cystine-glutamate exchange and thereby stimulating extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). NAC treatment of rats restored the ability to induce LTP and LTD by indirectly stimulating mGluR2/3 and mGluR5, respectively. Our findings show that cocaine self-administration induces metaplasticity that inhibits further induction of synaptic plasticity, and this impairment can be reversed by NAC, a drug that also prevents relapse."

https://openalex.org/W2125878780,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persists in a latent form in infected individuals treated effectively with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In part, these latent proviruses account for the rebound in viral replication observed after treatment interruption. A major therapeutic challenge is to purge this reservoir. In this study, we demonstrate that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) reactivates HIV from latency in chronically infected cell lines and primary cells. Indeed, P-TEFb, a critical transcription cofactor for HIV, is released and then recruited to the viral promoter upon stimulation with SAHA. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is involved in the initiation of these events. Using flow cytometry-based single cell analysis of protein phosphorylation, we demonstrate that SAHA activates this pathway in several subpopulations of T cells, including memory T cells that are the major viral reservoir in peripheral blood. Importantly, SAHA activates HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals treated effectively with HAART. Thus SAHA, which is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, might be considered to accelerate the decay of the latent reservoir in HAART-treated infected humans.

Interruption of HAART, however, inevitably results in a rapid rebound of viremia, indicating that antiretroviral therapy-mediated viral suppression alone is unlikely to eradicate HIV. HIV DNA can integrate stably into the DNA of resting memory T cells where it will persist until these cells die (1Chun T.W. Finzi D. Margolick J. Chadwick K. Schwartz D. Siliciano R.F. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). This major reservoir has an estimated half-life of 44 months, suggesting that 70 years of HAART treatment would be required for its eradication (2Finzi D. Blankson J. Siliciano J.D. Margolick J.B. Chadwick K. Pierson T. Smith K. Lisziewicz J. Lori F. Flexner C. Quinn T.C. Chaisson R.E. Rosenberg E. Walker B. Gange S. Gallant J. Siliciano R.F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Thus, designing new approaches to purge the reservoir of HIV represents a critical therapeutic challenge. The establishment of viral latency in the pool of memory T cells is multifactorial (3Lassen K. Han Y. Zhou Y. Siliciano J. Siliciano R.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 525-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Contreras X. Lenasi T. Peterlin B.M. Future Virol. 2006; 1: 733-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional repression of HIV plays a critical role. Several mechanisms have been identified, such as transcriptional interference (5Lenasi T. Contreras X. Peterlin B.M. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), chromatin remodeling via acetylation or methylation (6Marcello A.

Koiwa T. Watanabe T. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 69Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and lack of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or other activators (10Ganesh L. Burstein E. Guha-Niyogi A.

Various approaches antagonizing these distinct transcription blocks have been used to reactivate HIV from latently infected cells (11Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Fenard D. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42008-42017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This reactivation should contribute to the clearance of otherwise hidden pro-viruses by the immune system and HAART. Ideally, because generalized immune activation also increases the number of targets for new infections and has significant toxic side effects, these strategies should induce HIV transcription without activating cells of the immune system. Indeed, administrations of IL-2 and anti-CD3 antibodies have resulted in significant side effects without having any apparent positive effect on the latent reservoir (12Chun T.W. Engel D. Mizell S.B.

These compounds stimulate HIV replication while having limited effects on the activation of T cells and remain under investigation. Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is a critical component of the cellular transcriptional machinery that is also required for the elongation of HIV transcription. It is recruited to the HIV long terminal repeat (HIV LTR) mainly via the viral transactivator Tat. P-TEFb is composed of two subunits as follows: the catalytic subunit, cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9), and the regulatory subunit, cyclin T1 (CycT1). It is present in two distinct complexes in cells, a small transcriptionally active complex (SC) and a large inactive complex (LC) (22Peterlin B.M. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 297-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In the latter complex, it is associated with the inhibitory hexamethylene bisacetamide-induced protein 1 or 2 (HEXIM1 or -2) and the 7SK small nuclear RNA as well as with methyl phosphate capping enzyme (also called BCDIN3), La-related protein 7 (LARP7), and several other proteins (23Jeronimo C. Forget D. Bouchard A. Li Q. Chua G. Poitras C. Therien C. Bergeron D. Bourassa S. Greenblatt J. Chabot B. Poirier G.G. Hughes T.R. Blanchette M. Price D.H. Coulombe B. Mol.

Bensaude O. Cohen E.A. Coulombe B. Price D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2219-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In cells, an equilibrium is maintained between these complexes. However, various stimuli such as UV light, actinomycin D, or 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole can alter this equilibrium and release P-TEFb from the LC. P-TEFb is not recruited to the HIV LTR in latently infected T cells. Thus, releasing active P-TEFb from the LC should be an excellent strategy to activate viral replication in these cells. Indeed, UV light and actinomycin D activate HIV transcription via P-TEFb (25Casse C. Giannoni F. Nguyen V.T. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16097-16106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). We and others recently demonstrated that HMBA also releases P-TEFb from the LC (20Choudhary S.K. Archin N.M. Margolis D.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2008; 197: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Contreras X. Barboric M. Lenasi T. Peterlin B.M.

Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, these two compounds are not suitable for use in humans. HMBA is the prototypic member of the family of hybrid polar compounds. These chemicals are characterized by their ability to induce terminal differentiation and/or apoptosis of various transformed cells (28Richon V.M. Webb Y. Merger R. Sheppard T. Jursic B. Ngo L.

Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Michaeli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HMBA stimulates viral replication in various latently infected cell lines as well as T cells from HAART-treated patients (21Contreras X. Barboric M. Lenasi T. Peterlin B.M. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Antoni B.A. Rabson A.B. Kinter A. Bodkin M. Poli G.

The PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in this release of P-TEFb. This pathway leads to the phosphorylation of threonine 270 and serine 278 in HEXIM1, which releases the SC. P-TEFb is required for the activation of HIV transcription by HMBA (21Contreras X. Barboric M. Lenasi T. Peterlin B.M. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that Sp1 could contribute to the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter (20Choudhary S.K. Archin N.M. Margolis D.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2008; 197: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In another study, the release of calcium also activates PP2B and PP1α, which contribute to this disruption of the LC in HeLa cells (27Chen R. Liu M. Li H. Xue Y. Ramey W.N. He N. Ai N. Luo H. Zhu Y. Zhou N. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another hybrid polar compound, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), was recently approved for use as a treatment of cutaneous lymphoma, offering a potential clinically available approach for the clearance of the viral reservoir in HIV-infected patients treated effectively with HAART. Unlike HMBA, SAHA is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. However, like HMBA, it also activates the PI3K/Akt pathway transiently (33Liu Y. Denlinger C.E. Rundall B.K. Smith P.W. Jones D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31359-31368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that the subsequent inhibition of this pathway contributes to the death of cancer cell lines (34Rahmani M. Yu C. Reese E. Ahmed W. Hirsch K. Dent P. Grant S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6231-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the potential for SAHA to stimulate HIV replication from latently infected cells. Indeed, the PI3K/Akt pathway was involved in the activation of P-TEFb and its recruitment to the HIV LTR. Strikingly, SAHA was as potent as the powerful mitogen PHA in inducing HIV production from cultures of primary lymphocytes from patients treated effectively with HAART. Patients-Samples from HIV-infected adults were obtained from the University of California, San Francisco SCOPE cohort. Cryopreserved PBMCs were obtained from subjects who had been treated without interruption with at least three different Food and Drug Administration-approved antiretroviral agents and who had plasma HIV RNA levels persistently below the limit of detection with commercially available assays (less than 50 or 75 copies/ml). Subjects were required to have undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels for at least 6 months but less than 5 years. Cell Lines-The following reagent was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health: U1, ACH-2, J1.1 from Dr. Thomas Folks (35Clouse K.A.

JΔK cells were kindly provided by Arnold Rabson, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, and described previously (30Antoni B.A. Rabson A.B. Kinter A. Bodkin M. Poli G. Virology. 1994; 202: 684-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were obtained from the ATCC. Jurkat, U1, ACH-2, and JΔK cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. TZM-Bl cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing the same supplements. Immunoreagents and Chemicals-The anti-CycT1 (catalog number sc-8127) and anti-Cdk9 (catalog number sc-13130) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-HEXIM1 antibody was described previously (38Li Q. Price J.P. Byers S.A. Cheng D. Peng J. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28819-28826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). SAHA (synthesized by Prof. C. S. Chen) was resuspended in DMSO to obtain a stock solution of 20 mm. Chemical inhibitors, Akt inhibitor VIII (AI8), and LY 294002 (Calbiochem) were resuspended in DMSO. Reagents Used for PhosFlow Analysis-The following antibodies were used for detection of cell surface markers in Phos-Flow: CD3 (clone SP34–2, Alexa700-conjugated at a dilution 1:100, purchased from Invitrogen); CD4 (clone S3.5, PE-Cy7, 1:100, Invitrogen); CD8 (clone 3B5, PE-Cy7, 1:1000, Invitrogen); CD27 (clone 0323, 1:100, APC-Alexa750, eBioscience); CD33 (PerCP-Cy5.5, 1:25, eBioscience); and CD45 (clone 2H4, ACD, 1:100, Beckman Coulter). Dead cells were stained with a violet-fluorescent fixable Live/Dead® amine-reactive dye (1:1000, Invitrogen). The phospho-specific antibodies (ERK1/2 (Thr(P)-202/Tyr(P)-204, Alexa488), Akt (Thr(P)-308, PE), both from BD Biosciences) were used at a dilution of 1:25. For mitogenic stimulation, PMA (100 ng/ml, Sigma) was used in combination with ionomycin calcium salt (1 μg/ml, Sigma). For fixation of cells, we used a final concentration of 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Cells were permeabilized with 70% methanol (Fisher). Activation of HIV Production in HIV Chronically Infected Cell Lines-U1 or JΔK cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates; supernatant was collected before stimulation with SAHA and then every day, and viral release in the supernatant was quantified by p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Base-line levels were 50–100 pg/ml in control cells. Pre-treatment with inhibitor was done 1 h before stimulation by 1 mm SAHA. Luciferase Assay-TZM-Bl cells (106 cells) were lysed in 200 μl of luciferase reporter lysis buffer (catalog number E387A, Promega, Madison, WI). After centrifugation, cell debris was discarded. Half of the lysis solution was used for analysis using a luminometer. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation Analysis-Glycerol gradients (10–30%) were established by pipetting 2 ml of each of the glycerol fractions (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% v/v) in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.3 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) into centrifugation tubes (catalog number 331372, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Gradients were formed by standing for 6 h at 4 °C. Jurkat cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% protease inhibitor and either 0.5% RNase inhibitor or RNase A (100 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were loaded into tubes with the preformed glycerol gradients. Protein complexes were then fractionated by centrifugation in an SW 41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 38,000 rpm for 20 h. Ten fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies (39Yik J.H. Chen R. Pezda A.C. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16368-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Infection of PBMCs and Isolation of Resting CD4+ T Cells-PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats of healthy HIV-negative donors in a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). PBMCs were then plated at 5 × 106 cells per ml in 24-well plates, using RPMI 1640 medium (10% human serum AB). After 30 min, nonadherent cells were isolated and cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (containing penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum) with IL-2 (10 units/ml) and PHA (3 μg/ml). After 3 days, cells were treated or not with SAHA (1 mm) in the presence or absence of 1 mm Akt inhibitor 8 (AI8, Calbiochem, 30-min preincubation). After isolation, 107 nonadherent cells were activated with PHA (5 μg/ml) and IL-2 (10 units/ml) for 3 days and infected with HIV strain HIV-1LAI (0.1 ng/ml p24). They were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with IL-2 (10 units/ml). After 11 days, resting CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection using magnetic beads (Invitrogen). Cells were more than 95% pure as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. These cells were then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum. These cells expressed neither CD25 nor HLA-DR. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays-ChIP was carried out essentially as described previously (40Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was achieved by incubating 7 × 107 cells (U1 or JΔK) in 1% formaldehyde in medium for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were then pelleted in a conical tube and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of Lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 10 min on ice and subjected to sonification to obtain DNA fragments averaging ∼200–500 bp in length. One-tenth of the total chromatin solution was used in each ChIP. Chromatin solutions were pre-cleared with protein A/G-Sepharose beads and then incubated with the appropriate antibody at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads were then added, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. The beads were washed five times in TSE-150 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), TSE-500 (like TSE-150 but with 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and twice in Tris/EDTA buffer. Immune complexes were eluted from the beads with elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.5% NaHCO3) for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were then treated with proteinase K, followed by the reversion of cross-linking between DNA and protein at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 30 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer. DNA (3 μl) was used with appropriate primer sets to amplify specific DNA fragments. Quantitative PCR was then performed using a Stratagene MX3000P real time PCR system. Primers used for LTR were described previously (7Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Verdin E. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and primers for Gag spanned the region between nucleotides 1144 and 1410. Standard curves for each primer pair were first obtained to check for their respective efficiency. Products were quantified using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer’s directions. Relative intensity was calculated and normalized to the input. Fold induction was assessed as the immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies over isotype antibody control. PhosFlow Analysis-Protein phosphorylation levels in different subsets of primary human PBMCs were analyzed by protein phosphorylation (41Schweneker M. Favre D. Martin J.N. Deeks S.G. McCune J.M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, frozen PBMCs were thawed in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and rested at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. The following day, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate. Cells were stained for expression of the cell surface markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD27, CD45RA, and CD33 for 30 min on ice. An amine-reactive dye was used as a dead cell marker. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with SAHA or PMA/ionomycin at 37 °C; stimulation was stopped after 15 min by immediate fixation with paraformaldehyde at a final concentration of 2%. After 20 min of fixation, cells were permeabilized in 70% ice-cold methanol for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed and stained with phospho-specific antibodies for 60 min on ice. Unstimulated control cells underwent the same manipulations. Cells were analyzed on a customized LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analyses of data were performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Fold changes in phosphorylation were calculated as the ratio of median fluorescence intensity of stimulated cells over unstimulated cells. SAHA Activates HIV Replication at the Level of Transcription-To characterize the ability of SAHA to stimulate viral replication, increasing concentrations of SAHA were used to stimulate chronically infected cell lines. We analyzed the production of viral particles using p24 ELISA. Increased HIV replication was detected in lymphocytic JΔK (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–5) and ACH-2 as well as monocytic U1 cell lines (data not shown) upon SAHA treatment. This increase was dose-dependent, reaching a 40-fold induction with 10 μm SAHA. Previously, HMBA was demonstrated to stimulate HIV transcription (21Contreras X. Barboric M. Lenasi T. Peterlin B.M. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32Vlach J. Pitha P.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 42He N. Pezda A.C. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7068-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether SAHA stimulates viral replication by affecting gene expression from an HIV LTR, we used TZM-Bl cells that contain an integrated HIV LTR linked to the luciferase reporter gene in their genome. Indeed, SAHA induced a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity, up to 30-fold compared with the unstimulated control in these cells (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SAHA activates gene expression from the HIV LTR in cell lines. To assess the ability of SAHA to stimulate viral replication in primary cells, we used a primary cell model for latent infection, as described previously (21Contreras X. Barboric M. Lenasi T. Peterlin B.M. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Resting CD4+ T cells obtained using this protocol are quiescent with low levels of residual replication. Thus, any activation over this background is presented as fold induction. In these primary cells, SAHA induced a 5-fold increase in HIV replication (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). We conclude that SAHA stimulates expression from the HIV LTR and activates viral replication in latently infected cell lines as well as in primary cells. SAHA-induced HIV Replication Is Dependent on the PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway-The PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in HMBA-induced HIV replication (21Contreras X. Barboric M. Lenasi T. Peterlin B.M. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pathway is also activated by SAHA, we used PI3K and Akt inhibitors. Indeed, Akt and PI3K inhibitors decreased SAHA-induced viral replication by 70% (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1–3). Importantly, these inhibitors had no significant effect on basal levels of HIV production. These results suggest that SAHA stimulates viral replication in cells in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. SAHA Activates Akt in Primary Memory T Cell Subpopulation-To characterize this activation of PI3K/Akt under physiological conditions, we next used flow cytometry-based single cell analysis of protein phosphorylation to determine the protein phosphorylation status in different populations of primary T cells, as described previously (41Schweneker M. Favre D. Martin J.N. Deeks S.G. McCune J.M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PI3K/Akt activation was followed using antibodies against the active, phosphorylated form of Akt. Antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 were used as a control to follow the MAPK pathway. PBMCs from HIV-uninfected donors were analyzed for expression levels of specific cell surface markers on T cells (CD3, CD4, or CD8) and monocytes (CD3 and CD33). The maturation markers CD45RA and CD27 were used to subdivide CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes into subpopulations of naive (CD45RA+CD27+) and memory (CD45RA-CD27+) T cells. Stimulation with SAHA for 15 min induced the activation of Akt in all populations of T cells tested in a dose-dependent manner, reaching 2-fold induction of phosphorylation with 5 μm SAHA (Fig. 2A). Several time points were analyzed for activation with SAHA, and 15 min was found to be the best time point. Of interest, the positive control (PMA + ionomycin) also induced a 2.5-fold increase of Akt phosphorylation. Critically, Akt was activated in memory T cells, which contain most of the latent HIV proviruses in the blood (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Such stimulation had lesser effects in monocytes (Fig. 2A, lane 5). In contrast, whereas ERK1/2 MAPK was not phosphorylated upon stimulation with SAHA, PMA/ionomycin induced a more than 3-fold stimulation of this pathway in all populations analyzed (Fig. 2B). This suggests that SAHA does not induce global T cell activation, in agreement with previous studies (43Li N. Zhao D. Kirschbaum M. Zhang C. Lin C.L. Todorov I. Kandeel F. Forma"
https://openalex.org/W1967305117,"Phospholipase D (PLD) is an essential enzyme responsible for the production of the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid participates in both G protein-coupled receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction networks. The lack of potent and isoform-selective inhibitors has limited progress in defining the cellular roles of PLD. We used a diversity-oriented synthetic approach and developed a library of PLD inhibitors with considerable pharmacological characterization. Here we report the rigorous evaluation of that library, which contains highly potent inhibitors, including the first isoform-selective PLD inhibitors. Specific members of this series inhibit isoforms with >100-fold selectivity both in vitro and in cells. A subset of inhibitors was shown to block invasiveness in metastatic breast cancer models. These findings demonstrate the power of diversity-oriented synthesis combined with biochemical assays and mass spectrometric lipid profiling of cellular responses to develop the first isoform-selective PLD inhibitors--a new class of antimetastatic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2144123285,"A main function of white adipose tissue is to release fatty acids from stored triacylglycerol for other tissues to use as an energy source. Whereas endocrine regulation of lipolysis has been extensively studied, autocrine and paracrine regulation is not well understood. Here we describe the role of the newly identified major adipocyte phospholipase A(2), AdPLA (encoded by Pla2g16, also called HREV107), in the regulation of lipolysis and adiposity. AdPLA-null mice have a markedly higher rate of lipolysis owing to increased cyclic AMP levels arising from the marked reduction in the amount of adipose prostaglandin E(2) that binds the Galpha(i)-coupled receptor, EP3. AdPLA-null mice have markedly reduced adipose tissue mass and triglyceride content but normal adipogenesis. They also have higher energy expenditure with increased fatty acid oxidation within adipocytes. AdPLA-deficient ob/ob mice remain hyperphagic but lean, with increased energy expenditure, yet have ectopic triglyceride storage and insulin resistance. AdPLA is a major regulator of adipocyte lipolysis and is crucial for the development of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2156001353,"Deletions of the PAFAH1B1 gene (encoding LIS1) in 17p13.3 result in isolated lissencephaly sequence, and extended deletions including the YWHAE gene (encoding 14-3-3epsilon) cause Miller-Dieker syndrome. We identified seven unrelated individuals with submicroscopic duplication in 17p13.3 involving the PAFAH1B1 and/or YWHAE genes, and using a 'reverse genomics' approach, characterized the clinical consequences of these duplications. Increased PAFAH1B1 dosage causes mild brain structural abnormalities, moderate to severe developmental delay and failure to thrive. Duplication of YWHAE and surrounding genes increases the risk for macrosomia, mild developmental delay and pervasive developmental disorder, and results in shared facial dysmorphologies. Transgenic mice conditionally overexpressing LIS1 in the developing brain showed a decrease in brain size, an increase in apoptotic cells and a distorted cellular organization in the ventricular zone, including reduced cellular polarity but preserved cortical cell layer identity. Collectively, our results show that an increase in LIS1 expression in the developing brain results in brain abnormalities in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2129788206,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with few effective therapeutic options for advanced disease. At least 40% of HCCs are clonal, potentially arising from STAT3+, NANOG+ and OCT3/4+ liver progenitor/stem cell transformation, along with inactivation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. Here we report significantly greater signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in human HCC tissues (P<0.0030 and P<0.0455, respectively) than in human normal liver. Further, in HCC cells with loss of response to TGF-β, NSC 74859, a STAT3-specific inhibitor, markedly suppresses growth. In contrast, CD133+ status did not affect the response to STAT3 inhibition: both CD133+ Huh-7 cells and CD133– Huh-7 cells are equally sensitive to NSC 74859 treatment and STAT3 inhibition, with an IC50 of 100 μM. Thus, the TGF-β/beta2 spectrin (β2SP) pathway may reflect a more functional ‘stem/progenitor’ state than CD133. Furthermore, NSC 74859 treatment of Huh-7 xenografts in nude mice significantly retarded tumor growth, with an effective dose of only 5 mg/kg. Moreover, NSC 74859 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in HCC cells in vivo. We conclude that inhibiting interleukin 6 (IL6)/STAT3 in HCCs with inactivation of the TGF-β/β2SP pathway is an effective approach in management of HCCs. Thus, IL6/STAT3, a major signaling pathway in HCC stem cell renewal and proliferation, can provide a novel approach to the treatment of specific HCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2083515846,"Decorin and biglycan are class I small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) involved in regulation of collagen fibril and matrix assembly. We hypothesize that tissue-specific matrix assembly, such as in the cornea, requires a coordinate regulation involving multiple SLRPs. To this end, we investigated the expression of decorin and biglycan in the cornea of mice deficient in either SLRP gene and in double-mutant mice. Decorin and biglycan exhibited overlapping spatial expression patterns throughout the corneal stroma with differential temporal expression. Whereas decorin was expressed at relatively high levels in all developmental stages, biglycan expression was high early, decreased during development, and was present at very low levels in the mature cornea. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated comparable fibril structure in the decorin- and biglycan-null corneas compared with wild-type controls. We found a compensatory up-regulation of biglycan gene expression in the decorin-deficient mice, but not the reverse. Notably, the corneas of compound decorin/biglycan-null mice showed severe disruption in fibril structure and organization, especially affecting the posterior corneal regions, corroborating the idea that biglycan compensates for the loss of decorin. Fibrillogenesis assays using recombinant decorin and biglycan confirmed a functional compensation, with both having similar effects at high SLRP/collagen ratios. However, at low ratios decorin was a more efficient regulator. The use of proteoglycan or protein core yielded comparable results. These findings provide firm genetic evidence for an interaction of decorin and biglycan during corneal development and further suggest that decorin has a primary role in regulating fibril assembly, a function that can be fine-tuned by biglycan during early development."
https://openalex.org/W2126686784,"Based on the mechanism for chromophore formation in red fluorescent proteins, we developed three mCherry-derived monomeric variants, called fluorescent timers (FTs), that change their fluorescence from the blue to red over time. These variants exhibit distinctive fast, medium and slow blue-to-red chromophore maturation rates that depend on the temperature. At 37 degrees C, the maxima of the blue fluorescence are observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence are reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively. The FTs show similar timing behavior in bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Medium-FT allowed for tracking of the intracellular dynamics of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) and determination of its age in the targeted compartments. The results indicate that LAMP-2A transport through the plasma membrane and early or recycling endosomes to lysosomes is a major pathway for LAMP-2A trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W2032750617,"Type XIV collagen is a fibril-associated collagen with an interrupted triple helix. This collagen interacts with the fibril surface and has been implicated as a regulator of fibrillogenesis; however, a specific role has not been elucidated. Functional roles for type XIV collagen were defined utilizing a new type XIV collagen-deficient mouse line. This line was produced using a conventional targeted knock-out approach. Col14a1(-/-) mice were devoid of type XIV collagen, whereas heterozygous mice had reduced synthesis. Both mutant Col14a1 genotypes were viable with a grossly normal phenotype; however, mature skin exhibited altered mechanical properties. Prior to evaluating tendon fibrillogenesis in type XIV collagen-deficient mice, the developmental expression patterns were analyzed in wild-type flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendons. Analyses of mRNA and protein expression indicated tissue-specific temporal expression that was associated with the early stages in fibrillogenesis. Ultrastructural analyses of wild-type and null tendons demonstrated premature fibril growth and larger fibril diameters in tendons from null mice at postnatal day 4 (P4). However, fibril structure in mature tendons was normal. Biomechanical studies established a direct structure/function relationship with reduced strength in P7-null tendons. However, the biomechanical properties in P60 tendons were comparable in null and wild-type mice. Our results indicate a regulatory function for type XIV collagen in early stages of collagen fibrillogenesis with tissue differences."

https://openalex.org/W1972698666,"Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin that recognizes beta-glucan in the cell walls of fungi and plays an important role in anti-fungal immunity. It signals via tyrosine kinase Syk and adaptor protein Card9 to activate NF-kappaB leading to proinflammatory cytokine production in dendritic cells (DCs). Other than this, not much else is known of the mechanism of Dectin-1 signaling. We demonstrate here that stimulation of DCs with zymosan triggers an intracellular Ca2+ flux that can be attenuated by a blocking anti-Dectin-1 antibody or by pre-treatment of cells with the phospholipase C (PLC) gamma-inhibitor U73122, suggesting that Dectin-1 signals via a PLCgamma pathway to induce Ca2+ flux in DCs. Interestingly, treatment of DCs with particulate curdlan, which specifically engages Dectin-1, results in the phosphorylation of both PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2. However, we show that PLCgamma2 is the critical enzyme for Dectin-1 signaling in DCs. PLCgamma2-deficient DCs have drastic impairment of Ca2+ signaling and are defective in their secretion of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. PLCgamma2-deficient DCs also exhibit impaired activation of ERK and JNK MAPKs and AP-1 and NFAT transcription factors in response to Dectin-1 stimulation. In addition, PLCgamma2-deficient DCs are also impaired in their activation of NF-kappaB upon Dectin-1 engagement due to defective assembly of the Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 complex and impaired IKKalpha/beta activation and IkappaBalpha degradation. Thus, our data indicate that pattern recognition receptors such as Dectin-1 could elicit Ca2+ signaling and that PLCgamma2 is a critical player in the Dectin-1 signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2045618671,"Fate-mapping the cells that express the homeodomain transcription factor Dbx1 in the developing mouse brain, this study finds that the preoptic area is a previously unknown source of inhibitory amygdala neurons. In contrast, excitatory amygdala neurons are shown to develop from Dbx1-positive cells in the ventral pallium. The development of the amygdala, a central structure of the limbic system, remains poorly understood. We found that two spatially distinct and early-specified telencephalic progenitor pools marked by the homeodomain transcription factor Dbx1 are major sources of neuronal cell diversity in the mature mouse amygdala. We found that Dbx1-positive cells of the ventral pallium generate the excitatory neurons of the basolateral complex and cortical amygdala nuclei. Moreover, Dbx1-derived cells comprise a previously unknown migratory stream that emanates from the preoptic area (POA), a ventral telencephalic domain adjacent to the diencephalic border. The Dbx1-positive, POA-derived population migrated specifically to the amygdala and, as defined by both immunochemical and electrophysiological criteria, generated a unique subclass of inhibitory neurons in the medial amygdala nucleus. Thus, this POA-derived population represents a previously unknown progenitor pool dedicated to the limbic system."

Despite the importance of categorical perception to learned vocal communication, the neural correlates underlying this phenomenon await identification. We found that individual sensorimotor neurons in freely behaving swamp sparrows expressed categorical auditory responses to changes in note duration, a learned feature of their songs, and that the neural response boundary accurately predicted the categorical perceptual boundary measured in field studies of the same sparrow population. Furthermore, swamp sparrow populations that learned different song dialects showed different categorical perceptual boundaries that were consistent with the boundary being learned. Our results extend the analysis of the neural basis of perceptual categorization into the realm of vocal communication and advance the learned vocalizations of songbirds as a model for investigating how experience shapes categorical perception and the activity of categorically responsive neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2163839210,"The acute-phase response (APR) is characterized by an impaired metabolism of the essential trace element selenium (Se). Moreover, low-Se concentrations correlate to mortality risk in sepsis. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of the central Se transport and storage protein selenoprotein P (Sepp1) during an APR in mice. Serum Se and Sepp1 concentrations declined in parallel after injection of lipopolysaccharide to 50 and 39% of control-injected littermates, respectively. This negative APR proceeded largely independent from hepatic Sepp1 transcript concentrations. Instead, we identified a set of hepatic transcripts involved in Se metabolism, which declined coordinately during the APR, including the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor (EFsec), selenophosphate-synthetase 2 (Sephs2), selenocysteine-tRNA[Ser]Sec synthase (SecS), and phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec kinase (Pstk). Pstk reacted most strongly and qualified as a new limiting factor for Sepp1 biosynthesis in siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments in hepatocytes in culture. Analogous experiments were performed with mice transgenic for hepatocyte-specific human Sepp1 cDNA to verify this hypothesis. Similar kinetics and effect sizes of Sepp1 expression were observed as before in wild-type mice. We conclude that hepatic translation of Sepp1 mRNA is specifically impaired during the APR. This deficit disrupts regular Se metabolism, transport, and supply to peripheral tissues and likely aggravates the pathological status."
https://openalex.org/W2078520816,"We have previously shown that the death receptor ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) induces an increase of intracellular C(16)-ceramide in sensitive SW480 but not in resistant SW620 cells. Resistance in SW620 cells was overcome by exogenous ceramide, leading us to propose that defective ceramide signaling contributes to TRAIL resistance. In this study we found that the increase in C(16)-ceramide in SW480 cells was inhibited by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthases (CerS). Protein analysis revealed that TRAIL-resistant SW620 cells expressed lower levels of ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6, also known as longevity assurance homologue 6), which prompted us to investigate the effect of CerS6 modulation on TRAIL phenotype. RNAi against CerS6 resulted in a specific and significant decrease of the C(16)-ceramide species, which was sufficient to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In cells with decreased levels of CerS6, caspase-3 was activated but failed to translocate into the nucleus. CerS6 localized primarily to the perinuclear region, suggesting this enzyme may be important in regulation of nuclear permeability. Moderate elevation in CerS6 expression was sufficient to reverse TRAIL resistance in SW620 cells. These results suggest that modulation of CerS6 expression may constitute a new therapeutic strategy to alter apoptotic susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2046192706,"The calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin is controlled by regulator of calcineurin (RCAN) in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Here we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with RCAN1 as bait, identifying TAK1 binding protein 2 (TAB2) as an interacting partner. TAB2 interacted directly with RCAN1 in vitro and in vivo, recruiting TAK1, TAB1 and calcineurin, forming a macromolecular signalling complex. Overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1, or active TAK1(DeltaN), promoted direct phosphorylation of RCAN1 in vitro and in vivo. TAK1 phosphorylated RCAN1 at Ser 94 and Ser 136, converting RCAN1 from an inhibitor to a facilitator of calcineurin-NFAT signalling, and enhancing NFATc1 nuclear translocation, NFAT transcriptional activation and the hypertrophic growth of cultured cardiomyocytes. The TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 and the calcineurin-NFAT signalling modules did not interact in Rcan1/2- or Tab2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cultures. Calcineurin activation also dephosphorylated and inhibited TAK1 and TAB1, an effect that was absent in Rcan1/2 deficient MEFs. Functionally, TAK1 was indispensable for the cardiomyocyte growth response induced by pro-hypertrophic stimuli through calcineurin. These results describe a signalling relationship between two central regulatory pathways in which TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 selectively induces calcineurin-NFAT signalling through direct phosphorylation of RCAN1, while calcineurin activation diminishes TAK1 signalling by dephosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1."
https://openalex.org/W2075620341,"Systems genetics approaches are beginning to reveal how inherited genetic variants affect the structure and function of normal tissues, as well as individual susceptibility to diseases. A systems genetics study of skin tumour incidence, using crosses between two strains of mice one of which is susceptible and the other resistant to tumour development, has now been used to map genetic variants that contribute to skin cancer susceptibility. A comparison of gene expression in mutant mice with that in normal skin identifies gene expression motifs that contribute to tissue organization and various biological functions; key features emerging are a candidate master regulator of hair follicle fate, and a regulator of coordinated control of epidermal barrier function, inflammation and tumour susceptibility. Using crosses between two strains of mice, one of which is susceptible and the other resistant to tumour development, these authors mapped genetic variants that contribute to skin cancer susceptibility. By combining these data with gene expression in normal skin they generated a network view of the gene expression architecture of mouse skin and identify expression motifs that contribute to tissue organization and various biological functions. Germline polymorphisms in model organisms and humans influence susceptibility to complex trait diseases such as inflammation and cancer1,2,3,4. Mice of the Mus spretus species are resistant to tumour development, and crosses between M. spretus and susceptible Mus musculus strains have been used to map locations of genetic variants that contribute to skin cancer susceptibility4,5,6. We have integrated germline polymorphisms with gene expression in normal skin from a M. musculus × M. spretus backcross to generate a network view of the gene expression architecture of mouse skin. Here we demonstrate how this approach identifies expression motifs that contribute to tissue organization and biological functions related to inflammation, haematopoiesis, cell cycle control and tumour susceptibility. Motifs associated with inflammation, epidermal barrier function and proliferation are differentially regulated in backcross mice susceptible or resistant to tumour development. The intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5 is identified as a candidate master regulator of the hair follicle, and the vitamin D receptor (Vdr) is linked to coordinated control of epidermal barrier function, inflammation and tumour susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2122378582,"Emerging evidence indicates that in addition to native pentameric C-reactive protein (CRP), monomeric CRP (mCRP) also plays an active role in inflammation associated with cardiovascular diseases. mCRP activates endothelial cells, one of the critical events in cardiovascular diseases; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we report that association of mCRP with human aortic and coronary artery endothelial cells is predominantly due to membrane insertion rather than binding to the surface proteins Fc gammaRs and proteoglycans. We identify lipid rafts as the preferential membrane microdomains for mCRP anchorage. mCRP binding depends on membrane cholesterol content and is synergistically mediated by the putative cholesterol binding consensus sequence of CRP (aa 35-47) and the C-terminal octapeptide (aa 199-206). Conversely, disrupting lipid rafts with methyl-beta cyclodextrin or nystatin abrogated mCRP-induced cytokine release, reactive oxygen species generation, and adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells. Furthermore, ex vivo treatment of rabbit thoracic aorta and carotid artery segments with nystatin prevented mCRP-induced IL-8 release. Our data identify mCRP-lipid raft interaction as an important mechanism in mediating cellular responses to mCRP and lend further support to the notion of mCRP regulation of endothelial cell function during inflammation."

The control of cell fate in neural progenitor cells is critical for nervous system development. Nevertheless, the processes involved are only partially known. We found that the expression of the tumor suppressor Pml was restricted to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the developing neocortex of the mouse. Notably, in Pml−/− cortices, the overall number of proliferating NPCs was increased and transition between the two major progenitor types, radial glial cells and basal progenitors, was impaired. This in turn resulted in reduced differentiation and an overall decrease in the thickness of the cortex wall. In NPCs, Pml regulated the subcellular distribution of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the protein phosphatase 1α, triggering pRb dephosphorylation. Together, these findings reveal an unexpected role of Pml in controlling the function of NPCs in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2166236894,"Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate electrical signaling in excitable cells such as muscle and neurons. They also are expressed in non-excitable cells such as macrophages and neoplastic cells. Previously, in macrophages, we demonstrated expression of SCN8A, the gene that encodes the channel NaV1.6, and intracellular localization of NaV1.6 to regions near F-actin bundles, particularly at areas of cell attachment. Here we show that a splice variant of NaV1.6 regulates cellular invasion through its effects on podosome and invadopodia formation in macrophages and melanoma cells. cDNA sequence analysis of SCN8A from THP-1 cells, a human monocyte-macrophage cell line, confirmed the expression of a full-length splice variant that lacks exon 18. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated NaV1.6-positive staining within the electron dense podosome rosette structure. Pharmacologic antagonism with tetrodotoxin (TTX) in differentiated THP-1 cells or absence of functional NaV1.6 through a naturally occurring mutation (med) in mouse peritoneal macrophages inhibited podosome formation. Agonist-mediated activation of the channel with veratridine caused release of sodium from cationic vesicular compartments, uptake by mitochondria, and mitochondrial calcium release through the Na/Ca exchanger. Invasion by differentiated THP-1 and HTB-66 cells, an invasive melanoma cell line, through extracellular matrix was inhibited by TTX. THP-1 invasion also was inhibited by small hairpin RNA knockdown of SCN8A. These results demonstrate that a variant of NaV1.6 participates in the control of podosome and invadopodia formation and suggest that intracellular sodium release mediated by NaV1.6 may regulate cellular invasion of macrophages and melanoma cells.

In excitable tissues such as muscle and nerve, activation of voltage-gated sodium channels initiates electrical signaling through sodium influx coupled to membrane depolarization (1Catterall W. Goldin A. Waxman S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). During muscle contraction or synaptic vesicle release, depolarization is coupled to increases in cytosolic calcium from extracellular and intracellular stores. Increased cytosolic sodium due to entry of sodium through plasma membrane channels may also be sufficient to mobilize calcium from intracellular stores (2Lowe D. Richardson B. Taylor P. Donatsch P.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9960-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Non-excitable cells such as bone marrow-derived macrophages also express voltage-gated sodium channels (6Carrithers M.

Neurol. 2007; 62: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In human macrophages, variants of the neuronal channel, NaV1.6, and the cardiac channel, NaV1.5, are expressed intracellularly but not at the plasma membrane (6Carrithers M. Dib-Hajj S. Carrithers L. Tokmoulina G. Pypaert M. Jonas E. Waxman S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7822-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NaV1.5 localizes to the macrophage late endosome in interferon-γ or lipolysaccharide-activated cells where it mediates endosomal acidification. NaV1.6 localizes to vesicles that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm and some of which are associated with the actin cytoskeleton. NaV1.6 has a less clear functional role in macrophages. Unlike NaV1.5, NaV1.6 is also expressed in unprimed human macrophages and in unprimed and primed mouse macrophages and microglia (7Craner M. Damarjian T. Liu S. Hains B. Lo A. Black J. Newcombe J.

Neurol. 2007; 62: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Many invasive neoplastic cell lines also express voltage-gated sodium channels, which may regulate their ability to metastasize (9Fraser S. Salvador V. Manning E. Mizal J. Altun S. Raza M. Berridge R. Djamgoz M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Adhesion and movement of monocytes, macrophages, and invasive neoplasms are regulated in part by podosome assembly. Podosomes are specialized regions of the F-actin cytoskeleton that mediate local adhesion, invasion, and migration in specific cell types such as macrophages, bone osteoclasts, and other immune-derived cells (10Miyauchi A.

In invasive neoplastic cells, these structures are called invadopodia and may be important determinants for invasiveness and metastasis (17Tarone G. Cirillo D. Giancotti F. Comoglio P. Marchisio P. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 159: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 18Chen W. J. Exp. Zool. 1989; 251: 167-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our goal here was to characterize the role of intracellular NaV1.6 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. A splice variant of NaV1.6 that lacks exon 18 is expressed at a low level in fetal neurons and many non-neural tissues (19Plummer N.W. McBurney M.W. Meisler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24008-24015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We demonstrate the expression of this splice variant of SCN8A, the gene that encodes NaV1.6 in macrophages, and show that pharmacologic antagonism with tetrodotoxin (TTX), 3The abbreviations used are: TTX, tetrodotoxin; m-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MCP-1, monocyte chemotractant protein; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; SBFI, sodium binding benzofuran isopthalate; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RFU, relative fluorescent unit. absence of a functional NaV1.6 due to a genetic mutation, or knockdown of NaV1.6 expression with shRNA impairs podosome formation in macrophages. Blockade of the channel also prevents cellular invasion of macrophages and melanoma cells through extracellular matrix. Activation of the channel by the voltage-gated sodium channel agonist veratridine leads to vesicular intracellular sodium release, uptake of sodium by the adjacent mitochondrial compartment, and release of mitochondrial calcium. These findings suggest that a variant of NaV1.6 contributes to the control of macrophage and melanoma cellular invasion through a signaling pathway that may link intracellular sodium channel activation to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Cells-THP-1 cells, a human premyelomonocytic leukemic cell line, were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. Differentiation to a macrophage phenotype was induced by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (10 ng/ml, 72 h). HTB-66 cells, an invasive human melanoma cell line, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. Mice-Resident peritoneal macrophages were obtained from C57BL6/J, NaV1.6-deficient C3HeB/FeJ-Scn8amed/J mice, and wild-type littermates (Jackson Laboratories) by peritoneal lavage with serum supplemented RPMI. C3HeB/FeJ-Scn8amed/J mice and their control littermates were ∼14-21 days of age and were bred in our facility from heterozygous carriers of the med recessive gene. C57BL6/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and used at 6-8 weeks of age. Macrophages were isolated by centrifugation followed by isolation of mononuclear cells on a lymphocyte separation medium step gradient and adhesion to glass coverslips. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/ml and maintained for 18-24 h in the same media as THP-1 cells. All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Yale University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Review Committee (IACUC). SCN8A cDNA Sequence Analysis-A PCR-based approach was used to sequence SCN8A cDNA generated from THP-1. mRNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and analyzed for expression of SCN8A by quantitative PCR as described previously (6Carrithers M. Dib-Hajj S. Carrithers L. Tokmoulina G. Pypaert M. Jonas E. Waxman S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7822-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Three-way (“stitched”) PCR was used to generate a full-length coding PCR fragment for sequencing (exon 2-27). First, two separate PCR fragments were synthesized: one (2.52 kb) with the 2F and 15R primers and the other (3.36 kb) with 15F and 27R primers (see Table S1 for primer sequences). These two fragments were gel eluted and purified. Equal amounts of these fragments were used as a template for the three-way PCR using the 2F and 27R primers to amplify a 5.8-kb fragment. Cycle conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min × 1 cycle, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 7 min (×34 cycles), and further extension at 68 °C for 10 min × 1 cycle. Sequencing of the 5.8-kb PCR product was performed at the W.M. Keck facility at Yale University School of Medicine. The primers used for sequencing (“primer walking”) of this product are shown in Table S1. The products were sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions for confirmation. DNAS-TAR (Lasergene) was used for analysis of the sequence data. Immunohistochemistry-Cells grown on multichambered glass coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (10 min), and blocked in PBS containing 5% serum (goat or donkey, dependent on secondary antibody), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.04 mg/ml normal human IgG. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. Rabbit anti-NaV1.6 was obtained from Alomone Laboratories. Goat anti-gelsolin and mouse anti-dynamin II were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and BD Biosciences, respectively. Secondary donkey antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluorophores, MitoTracker dye, and phalloidin-Alexa 350 and 488 were obtained from Invitrogen. 4′,6′-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was from Vector Laboratories. Images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope with a ×63 objective (Zeiss Plan Apochromat, 1.4 oil). Electron Microscopy-For fixation for regular epon embedding to show membrane preservation, samples were fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, with 3% sucrose for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were rinsed 3 times in sodium cacodylate rinse buffer and then pelleted in 2% agar. These were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, en bloc stained in 2% uranyl acetate in maleate buffer, pH 5.2, for a further hour then rinsed, dehydrated, and infiltrated with epon resin and baked overnight at 60 °C. Hardened blocks were cut using a Leica UltraCut UCT. 60-nm sections were collected and stained using 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For sample fixation for immunoelectron microscopy, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.25 m Hepes for 1 h. Samples were rinsed in PBS and re-suspended in 10% gelatin, chilled, and trimmed to smaller blocks and placed in cryoprotectant of 2.3 m sucrose overnight on a rotor at 4 °C. They were transferred to aluminum pins and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen. The frozen block was trimmed on a Leica Cryo-EMUC6UltraCut and 75-nm thick sections were collected. The frozen sections were collected on a drop of sucrose, thawed, and placed on a nickel formvar/carbon-coated grid and floated in a dish of PBS ready for immunolabeling. For immunolabeling of sections, grids were placed section side down on drops of 0.1 m ammonium chloride for 10 min to quench untreated aldehyde groups, then blocked for nonspecific binding in 1% fish skin gelatin in PBS for 20 min. Single labeled grids were incubated in either a primary antibody rabbit anti-Nav1.6, 1:50 (Alomone), or mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma), 1:200 dilutions, for 30 min. Controls were also done using rabbit IgG (Jackson) and mouse IgG (Jackson) at the same dilution. Secondary antibodies were either 12-nm anti-rabbit or anti-mouse colloidal gold (Jackson) for 30 min. Double labeling was performed as above but by combining the two primaries, rinsing, and then combining secondary direct gold anti-mouse 6 nm (actin) and anti-rabbit 12 nm (Nav1.6). All grids were rinsed in PBS, fixed using 1% gluteraldehyde for 5 min, and rinsed, transferring grids to a UA/methylcellulose drop for 10 min. Samples were all viewed on a FEI Tencai Biotwin TEM at 80 Kv. Images were taken using Morada CCD and iTEM (Olympus) software. Podosome Quantitation-Differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with serum-free media for 4 h in the presence and absence of 300 nm TTX, a concentration that blocks TTX-sensitive sodium channels such as NaV1.6 but not TTX-resistant channels such as NaV1.5. They were then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, incubated with phalloidin-Alexa 488 in 1% bovine serum albumin for an additional 20 min, and washed with PBS. Cells were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Podosomes were identified manually with an event marker (Zeiss Axiovision 4.6.3 software) from images taken with a ×40 objective (LD Plan-Neofluar, 0.6). Live Cell Imaging-For live cell imaging of sodium flux, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated THP-1 cells plated on a Delta T4 cell culture plate (Bioptechs) were labeled with 4 μm Sodium Green and 1 μm Corona Red for 40 min at 37 °C in Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS). Cells were washed three times with HBSS and then monitored for fluorescence on a heated microscopy stage (37 °C) with a heated ×63 oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope. Two color fluorescent images were taken in multiple Z-planes prior to and following a 1-min stimulation with veratridine (80 μm). Images were deconvoluted using Axiovision Three-dimensional Deconvolution software (Zeiss) and analyzed quantitatively with Axiovision 4.6.3 Automeasurement. Fluorometry-For time-resolved fluorescence analysis of THP-1 cells or freshly isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages, cells were isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in serum-free HBSS at room temperature, and labeled with indicator dyes. For sodium flux measurements, cells were labeled with the ratiometric sodium indicator SBFI-AM (4 μm) for 40 min at room temperature in HBSS and then washed with assay buffer by three successive centrifugations. Assay buffer was either 135 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 4 mm EGTA, 11 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, or the same buffer with NaCl replaced by 145 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG). NMDG-containing solutions were titrated to pH 7.4 with HCl. Prior to and following veratridine stimulation (80 μm), the ratio of fluorescence intensities excited at 340/380 nm was monitored at an emission wavelength of 505 nm in a LS-50b spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For calibration of intracellular sodium, THP-1 cells in NMDG buffer were mixed with increasing concentrations of extracellular sodium (5, 15, 25, and 50 mm NaCl, balanced in a molar fashion with NMDG) following permeabilization of cells with 0.1% Triton X-100. At least four separate measurements were taken at the indicated concentration to generate a standard curve. By this method, the estimated intracellular sodium concentration was 11.15 ± 0.92 mm (n = 4) in the presence of NMDG buffer. For Sodium Green fluorometric experiments, cells were labeled with 4 μm dye for 40 min and washed as described above. Samples were excited at 507 nm, and emission was monitored at 532 nm. For calcium flux experiments, THP-1 cells were labeled with 1 μm Fluo-4 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed by centrifugation three times with HBSS and then analyzed by fluorometry. In some experiments, cells were pre-treated with 4 mm EGTA or a combination of EGTA and 0.02 mm CGP-36517. Excitation was at 494 nm and emission at 516 nm. For Fura-2 measurements in mouse peritoneal macrophages, cells were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips overnight, washed with HBSS, and labeled with Fura-2 (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and then incubated in fresh HBSS for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Excitation was at 340 and 380 nm with ratiometric emission recorded at 510 nm. Calibration was performed using Ca-EGTA buffers in permeabilized cells. Invasion and Migration Assays-Cellular invasion through a reconstituted basement membrane matrix (ECMatrix, Chemicon) was measured in a 96-well plate format. In the presence and absence of TTX (300 nm), cells were serum starved in 0.1% FBS for 24 h prior to plating on the matrix. 100,000 cells were added to each well in 0.1 ml of media with 0.1% FBS in the presence and absence of freshly added TTX and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. For THP-1 cells, the lower chamber in the plate assay contained varying concentrations of human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-CSF) (25, 100, or 400 ng/ml) or no chemoattractant (control condition). THP-1 invasion also was examined in shRNA-treated cells at an m-CSF concentration of 100 ng/ml. For HTB-66 cells, the attractant was either 10% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (experimental condition) or 0.1% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (control condition). Cells that invaded through the matrix were dissociated, lysed, and detected by CyQuant GR dye (Invitrogen), using a fluorescent plate reader. Invasion was expressed in relative fluorescent units (RFU) and was determined by subtracting background invasion (control conditions) from that observed in the experimental conditions. Migration was measured in a transwell assay (Chemicon) using a5-μm pore size. THP-1 cells were serum starved for 4 h in the presence and absence of TTX (300 nm) and then analyzed in the migration assay in the presence and absence of freshly added TTX. Human monocyte chemotractant protein (MCP-1) was used as the stimulus (7.5 ng/ml-250 ng/ml for 2 h). Quantitative analysis was performed as described above for invasion assays. Small Hairpin RNA-THP-1 cells were transduced with shRNA lentiviral clones as previously described (6Carrithers M. Dib-Hajj S. Carrithers L. Tokmoulina G. Pypaert M. Jonas E. Waxman S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7822-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The following five clones, specific for human SCN8A (encodes NaV1.6), were obtained from Sigma: SHVRSC-TRCN0000044488-92. Percent knockdown was determined by real time PCR (Cepheid) using TaqMan FAM-labeled primers (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1). Clones 89 and 92 were selected for functional assays because of knockdown >75% or absence of significant knockdown, respectively. Knockdown of NaV1.6 in THP clone 89 also was confirmed by Western blot using the anti-NaV1.6 subtype-specific antibody.TABLE 1Real time PCR analysis of SCN8A expressionCell lineSCN8A Ct (threshold cycle)GAPDH CtnTHP-1 differentiated36.84 ± 0.3820.03THP-1 undifferentiated35.98 ± 0.9320.07HTB-6635.94 ± 0.4920.07THP-1 Clone 89 (differentiated)>39.74 (2 runs > 50 cycles)20.03THP-1 Clone 92 (differentiated)36.37 ± 0.2420.03Real time PCR analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ct values (threshold cycle) were normalized using GAPDH expression as a control (Ct = 20.0).

Statistics-Comparisons between groups were made using a Student's t test (unpaired, unequal variance) with a p < 0.05 considered statistically significant (Kaleidagraph 4.03, Synergy Software). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Image Processing-Microscopic images were obtained using Axiovision software as described above, exported as TIFF files, compiled in composite figures using Adobe Illustrator, and exported as TIFF files. cDNA Cloning of an SCN8A Transcript from THP-1 Cells Reveals a Splice Variant-cDNA sequence analysis of a full-length coding sequence for SCN8A from THP-1 cells demonstrated expression of the splice variant that lacks exon 18 (Figs. S1 and S2). This exon encodes a 41-amino acid portion of the IIIS3-IIIS4 transmembrane region of NaV1.6. This finding is consistent with prior studies of SCN8A because exon 18N, which was hypothesized to be a non-neuronal exon variant of SCN8A, encodes a stop codon within its sequence and, if expressed, would prevent the translation of a full-length NaV1.6 (19Plummer N.W. McBurney M.W. Meisler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24008-24015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A similar splice variant that would encode a truncated, but not full-length, variant of NaV1.6 has been described in another non-excitable cell type, astrocytes (20Oh Y. Waxman S.G. NeuroReport. 1998; 9: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Some NaV1.6 Positive Vesicles Are Localized Adjacent to Melanoma Invadopodia and Macrophage Podosomes-Previously we demonstrated by immunofluorescence and immuno-EM that macrophage NaV1.6 appeared to localize to F-actin fiber bundles (6Carrithers M. Dib-Hajj S. Carrithers L. Tokmoulina G. Pypaert M. Jonas E. Waxman S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7822-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here we further analyzed the relationship between NaV1.6-positive membrane structures and the F-actin cytoskeleton in cells known to form invadopodia and podosomes. In the invasive human melanoma cell line, HTB-66, primary mouse peritoneal macrophages, and the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, differentiated with phorbol ester to a macrophage phenotype, NaV1.6-positive vesicles were observed throughout the cell but in some cellular regions they appeared to cluster around melanoma invadopodia and the core of macrophage podosome structures (Figs. 1A and 2, A and C). Unlike the previous study where NaV1.6/F-actin co-localization was demonstrated in a more longitudinal view in a migrating cell (6Carrithers M. Dib-Hajj S. Carrithers L. Tokmoulina G. Pypaert M. Jonas E. Waxman S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7822-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), these views are cross-sectional and, in a more detailed fashion, show the NaV1.6-positive regions surrounding the F-actin core rather than localizing to the core itself. In mouse macrophages and differentiated THP-1 cells, this vesicular localization was most intense around centrally located podosomes (Fig. 2, A and C). In addition, in differentiated THP-1 cells, there were clusters of mitochondria concentrated in podosome-dense regions (Fig. 2C). This latter image (Fig. 2C) is a deconvoluted image through only Z-planes that were podosome positive at the sites of cellular attachment.FIGURE 2In macrophages, NaV1.6-positive vesicles localize to cellular regions rich in podosomes. A, phalloidin staining of F-actin (left panel, green) in a mouse peritoneal macrophage shows numerous podosomes (circular structures). Staining for NaV1.6 (middle panel, red) demonstrates positive staining of vesicular-type structures, some of which co-localize to the periphery of the F-actin-rich core of the podosome structure (merged image on the right). B, in a mouse peritoneal macrophage, NaV1.6-containing vesicles (red) also co-localize with the calcium-dependent, actin-regulatory protein gelsolin (green), particularly at the leading edge of the cell as compared with the trailing tail. C, a similar staining pattern was observed in differentiated THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, as compared with mouse primary mouse macrophages (A).

At the leading edge of a HTB-66 cell, NaV1.6-positive vesicles appeared to co-localize with or were adjacent to regions rich in F-actin and the GTPase Dynamin II, a known regulator of invadopodia and podosomes (21McNiven M.

https://openalex.org/W2102478648,"To define molecular events accompanying formation of the 3-dimensional (3D) vascular tube, we have characterized gene expression during vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tubular morphogenesis of endothelial cells. Microarray analyses were performed comparing gene induction in growth-arrested, tube-forming endothelial cells harvested from 3D collagen cultures to that in proliferating endothelial cells cultured on fibronectin. Differentially expressed genes were clustered and analyzed for specific endothelial expression through publicly available datasets. We validated the contribution of one of the identified genes, vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), to endothelial morphogenesis. Silencing of VE-PTP expression was accompanied by increased VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways. The increased VEGFR2 activity promoted endothelial cell cycle progression, overcoming the G(0)/G(1) arrest associated with organization into tubular structures in the 3D cultures. Proximity ligation showed close association between VEGFR2 and VE-PTP in resting cells. Activation of VEGFR2 by VEGF led to rapid loss of association, which was resumed with time in parallel with decreased receptor activity. In conclusion, we have identified genes, which may serve critical functions in formation of the vascular tube. One of these, VE-PTP, regulates VEGFR2 activity thereby modulating the VEGF-response during angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2155334255,"Development and progression of acquired abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have been associated with different inflammatory mediators. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the topology and the potential mechanisms linking the leukotriene pathway to human AAAs. Human aneurysmal lesions were obtained from 24 patients undergoing surgery, and the intraluminal thrombus was separated from the vascular wall. Histological examination revealed major expression of the leukotriene-producing enzymes 5-lipoxygenase and LTA(4) hydrolase, as well as the two receptors for leukotriene B(4) (BLT1R and BLT2R), corresponding to neutrophils in the luminal part of the thrombus. In contrast, in the vascular wall, the leukotriene pathway mainly localized in macrophage-rich adventitial areas. Furthermore, conditioned media of the intraluminal thrombus contained significantly higher concentrations of leukotriene B(4) than that derived from the vascular wall, which were significantly correlated to other neutrophil-derived mediators, such as elastase/alpha(1)-antitrypsin complexes, myeloperoxidase, and MMP9/NGAL complexes. Finally, the neutrophil-chemotactic activity of the conditioned media from the intraluminal thrombus exhibited major inhibition by antagonists of the leukotriene B(4) receptors. Taken together, these results indicate neutrophil-derived leukotriene B(4) as a major neutrophil chemotactic factor released from the intraluminal thrombus of human AAAs and suggest that targeting BLT receptors may represent a potential medical therapeutic strategy in the prevention of AAA progression in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2066702159,"Plexins, comprising Plexin-A, -B, -C, and -D subfamilies, are receptors for semaphorins governing cell adhesion, migration, and axon guidance. Among plexin subfamilies, Plexin-A1 and Plexin-B1 have been shown to function as an R-Ras GAP, inducing repulsive responses, and the expression of R-Ras GAP activity requires the binding of Rnd1, a member of Rnd subfamily of Rho GTPases. However, signaling pathways of Plexin-D1 and Plexin-C1 still remain obscure. Here, we found that Plexin-D1 displayed R-Ras GAP activity and inhibited migration of COS-7 cells, and these actions required Rnd2, another Rnd subfamily GTPase. Rnd2 bound to Plexin-D1 in cortical neurons, and Sema3E/Plexin-D1-induced inhibition of axon outgrowth of cortical neurons required Rnd2 and down-regulation of R-Ras activity. On the other hand, Plexin-C1 displayed R-Ras GAP activity and inhibited cell migration of COS-7 cells without Rnd proteins. Therefore, R-Ras GAP activity is a common function of plexin subfamilies but the regulation of R-Ras GAP activity of plexins by Rnd proteins is different among plexin subfamilies."
https://openalex.org/W1998682759,"Lipin 1 is a bifunctional intracellular protein that regulates fatty acid metabolism in the nucleus via interactions with DNA-bound transcription factors and at the endoplasmic reticulum as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase enzyme (PAP-1) to catalyze the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis. However, livers of 8-day-old mice lacking lipin 1 (fld mice) exhibited normal PAP-1 activity and a 20-fold increase in triglyceride levels. We sought to further analyze the hepatic lipid profile of these mice by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, hepatic content of phosphatidate, the substrate of PAP-1 enzymes, was markedly diminished in fld mice. Similarly, other phospholipids derived from phosphatidate, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, were also depleted. Another member of the lipin family (lipin 2) is enriched in liver, and hepatic lipin 2 protein content was markedly increased by lipin 1 deficiency, food deprivation, and obesity, often independent of changes in steady-state mRNA levels. Importantly, RNAi against lipin 2 markedly reduced PAP-1 activity in hepatocytes from both wild type and fld mice and suppressed triglyceride synthesis under conditions of high fatty acid availability. Collectively, these data suggest that lipin 2 plays an important role as a hepatic PAP-1 enzyme.

Collectively, these data suggest that lipin 2 plays an important role as a hepatic PAP-1 enzyme. Spontaneously arising mutations in the gene encoding lipin 1 (Lpin1) cause severe metabolic abnormalities in fatty liver dystrophic (fld) mice (1Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), which exhibit neonatal growth retardation, fatty liver, and dyslipidemia (2Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C.

However, adult fld mice exhibit lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and susceptibility to atherosclerotic lesion formation (3Rehnmark S. Giometti C.S. Slavin B.G. Doolittle M.H. Reue K. J.

As proof of the importance of lipin 1-mediated PAP-1 activity, fld mice almost completely lack this enzymatic activity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart (6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Kumar A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and the inability to synthesize TG in adipocytes may explain the defect in adipogenesis in fld mice. Interestingly, lipin 1 is a soluble protein, and significant lipin 1 localization to the nucleus has also been demonstrated (1Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that lipin 1 functions as a regulator of gene transcription via protein-protein interactions with DNA-bound transcription factors (7Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z.

PAP-1 catalytic activity is not required for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α coactivation, and these two molecular functions seem to be completely separable. Thus, lipin 1 is poised to play important roles in controlling the metabolism of fatty acids at multiple regulatory levels. Given the role of lipin 1 as an enzyme in TG synthesis, the hepatic phenotype of fld mice is somewhat surprising. First, neonatal fld mice exhibit severe hepatic steatosis because of over-accumulation of TG (2Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7994-8003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, although other tissues of fld mice are severely deficient in PAP-1 activity, the liver of adult fld mice retains significant Mg2+-dependent PAP activity (6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A.

These findings suggest that other PAP-1 enzymes are active in liver. Based on sequence homology in signature N- and C-terminal domains, two additional lipin family proteins (lipin 2 and lipin 3) have been identified (1Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Importantly, lipin 2 and 3 exhibit PAP-1 activity, although the relative activity and Vmax varies (lipin 1 > lipin 2 > lipin 3) (9Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3450-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the current study we further evaluated the hepatic phenotype of fld mice by using mass spectrometry-based lipidomic profiling of glycerophospholipid species and subsequently characterized the function and regulation of the liver-enriched PAP-1 protein, lipin 2. Animal Studies-Breeding pairs of fld/+× fld/+ mice were used to generate fld/fld (fld), fld/+, and WT littermate mice. Liver tissue was collected from db/db (male; 10 weeks old) and ob/ob (female; 18 weeks old) obese mice, each with lean, sexmatched littermate controls. PGC-1α–/– mice have been previously described (11Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F. Sambandam N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Chen Z. Holloszy J.O.

Short-term fasting studies were performed with individually housed male mice which were either food deprived for 36 h (beginning at 2000) or food deprived 24 h (beginning at 2000) and then given ad libitum access to standard rodent chow for 12 h. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine. Mammalian Cell Culture-HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum. Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from mice as previously described (12Chen Z. Fitzgerald R.L. Averna M.R. Schonfeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32807-32815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Adenoviral transductions were carried out by incubating hepatocytes with adenoviruses in a 5% fetal bovine serum, DMEM medium overnight at an multiplicity of infection of 8. Endpoints were collected 24 h later in lipin 2 overexpression studies or 72 h later when using RNAi. TG synthesis rates were quantified by using [3H]glycerol as previously described (7Finck B.N.

DNA Constructs-Full-length triple HA-tagged mouse lipin 2 was cloned into pCDNA3 expression construct, subcloned into the Ad-track cytomegalovirus vector, and recombined into the Ad-EASY system. The lipin 2 shRNA oligonucleotide was designed to target nucleotides 145–164 of the mouse Lpin2 transcript and was cloned into the Invitrogen pENTR vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the Ad-EASY system. Adenoviral-driven shRNA construct targeted to LacZ was utilized as a control. The pSPORT-lipin 3 expression vector has been previously described (7Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). siRNA Oligonucleotides and Transfection-A Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to synthesize three siRNAs for mouse lipin 2 and a scrambled, nonspecific sequence siRNA (control). The targeted nucleotide cDNA sequence for the three lipin 2 siRNAs are AACTCTACAAGGGCATTAACC (siRNA 50), AACCCAAACCAGCTGCTAAAG (siRNA 1118), and AAAGGCTCTTGAGCCTGAAGT (siRNA 1215). The siRNAs were transfected onto primary hepatocytes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Based on efficiency of knockdown (supplemental Fig. 1A), siRNA 1118 was chosen for all metabolic studies. Transfection was carried out after the hepatocytes were cultured for 3 h in 6-well plates, and a dosage of 100 pmol of siRNA/well was used. Experiments were carried out 60–72 h post-siRNA transfection. Mass Spectrometric Lipid Analysis-The quantitative analyses of TG and phospholipid species have been described (13Han X. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 14Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In brief, lipids were extracted from mouse liver using a modified Bligh and Dyer technique in the presence of internal standards for electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) analysis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses were performed utilizing a TSQ Quantum Ultra Plus triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with an automated nanospray apparatus (Nanomate HD, Advion Bioscience Ltd., Ithaca, NY). PAP-1 Activity-Phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP-1) activity was determined by using a modification of the method of Carman and Lin (15Carman G.M. Lin Y.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to measure phosphate release from Triton X-100/phosphatidic acid mixed micelles. Labeled phosphatidic acid was purified by thin layer chromatography after using [γ-32P]ATP and Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase to phosphorylate 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol. Samples of cell or tissue extracts (10 μl) were added to reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing a final concentration of 2 mm Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm [32P]phosphatidic acid (10,000 cpm/nmol), 50 mm Tris-maleate (pH 7.0), and either no added Mg2+ or 1.5 mm MgCl2. After 20 min at 30 °C the reactions were terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol. [32P]Phosphate was extracted by vigorous mixing after adding 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of 1 m MgCl2. The amount of soluble [32P] phosphate in 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was measured by scintillation counting. Mg2+-dependent PAP activity (PAP-1) was determined by subtracting activity obtained in the absence of MgCl2 from activity measured in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2. DG Acyltransferase Activity-Measurements of DG acyltransferase activity was carried out under apparent Vmax conditions for 10 min at room temperature in a final volume of 200 μl as described (16Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, each assay reaction contained 50 μg of liver membrane proteins, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 mm sucrose, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals; final specific radioactivity: 18,000 dpm/nmol), and 200 μm sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (Sigma). The acyl acceptor (sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol) was introduced into the reaction mixture as a liposome, which was prepared by mixing with phosphatidylcholine in at a molar ratio of 1:5 in a chloroform solution followed by evaporating chloroform under a stream of N2 and resuspending liposomes in water. Each individual assay reaction was started by adding liver membrane proteins to the reaction mixture and terminated by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2.2, v/v) after a 10-min incubation period. Total lipids were extracted from this final mixture and separated on Linear-K Preadsorbent TLC plates (Waterman Inc., Clifton, NJ) with hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v). The spots corresponding to TG was scraped from the TLC plates and determined for 14C radioactivity using a scintillation counter. Reaction mixtures in which liver membrane proteins were omitted were used as blanks for background correction. Northern and Western Blotting Analyses-Northern blotting analyses were performed using radiolabeled cDNA probes. Full-length cDNAs for mouse lipin 2 and lipin 3 were excised from the pCDNA3-HA-lipin 2 or pSPORT-lipin 3 expression vectors by restriction digest, gel-purified, and then labeled with [32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by using NucTrap Probe Purification Columns (Stratagene). Hybridizations were performed using Quickhyb (Stratagene) for 2 h at 65 °C. Blots were washed and then exposed to autoradiographic film. Western blotting studies were performed using antibodies directed against the HA epitope tag (Covance), lipin 2 (see below), phosphoserine 106 lipin (6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Kumar A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), lipin 3 (Alpha Diagnostic), adipophilin (ADRP; see below), liver fatty acid-binding protein (a gift of Nick Davidson), calnexin (Stressgen), acetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), or actin (Sigma). Polyclonal antibodies for lipin 2 and ADRP were generated by Proteintech Group Inc. by injecting rabbits with the recombinant keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide FPESTTKVSKRERSDHHPRTA (lipin 2) or MAAAVVDPQQSVVMRVANLPLVSSTYDLC (ADRP). Lipin 2 and ADRP antibodies were affinity-purified using the immunizing peptide. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR-Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the SYBR green kit. Arbitrary units of target mRNA were corrected by measuring the levels of 36B4 RNA. The sequence of the oligonucleotides used in quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses can be found in supplemental Table 1. Metabolic Labeling Studies-Primary hepatocytes isolated from adult WT and fld mice were plated onto 12-well plates. Hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus to overexpress lipin 2 and cultured in complete culture media for 20–24 h. After this initial culture period, the hepatocytes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Met- and Cys-free DMEM for 1 h. For pulse-chase studies, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of Met- and Cys-free DMEM containing 250 μCi of 35S-Promix (530 MBq/ml; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. For pulse-only studies, labeled methionine was administered for 30 min. After this pulse period, the hepatocytes were chased in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10 mm unlabeled Met and 3 mm Cys (1000× excess) for the specified time periods. After the specified times, cells were lysed in an immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.0625 m sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The 35S-labeled lipin 2 and albumin proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and quantified by SDS-PAGE analyses as described for the analysis of 35S-labeled apoB proteins (10Chen Z. Gropler M.C. Norris J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Harris T.E. Finck B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Liver Protein Fractionation by Gradient Centrifugation-Two adult male C57BL/6 mice were fasted overnight (14 h) and then sacrificed for tissue collection. Whole, fresh liver tissue from both mice was finely minced with a razorblade and then pooled. Minced livers were transferred to a Teflon-piston glass homogenizer with 2 ml of fractionation buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)) and homogenized with 4 stokes at 240 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. The pellet containing the nuclei was resuspended in 1-ml fractionation buffer. The post-nuclear supernatant was layered onto a 10-ml linear 20–50% (w/w) sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged for 3 h at 150,000 × g in a 14 × 89-mm tube. The floating fraction was recovered with a tube slicer. Twelve fractions were collected, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. An equal volume of each fraction was loaded so that the quantity of protein varied as is noted in Fig. 3C. Statistical Analyses-Statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance or t tests. All data are presented as the means ± S.E., with a statistically significant difference defined as a p value <0.05. Liver of fld Mice Exhibits Increased TG and Diminished PA Content-Despite the important role that lipin 1 plays in TG synthesis, livers of neonatal fld mice have a whitish appearance indicative of neutral lipid accumulation and contain very high levels of DG and TG (2Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7994-8003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Reue K. Doolittle M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1387-1405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has also demonstrated that hepatic PAP-1 activity is unchanged (9Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3450-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) or moderately decreased (6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Kumar A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in adult fld mice. However, PAP-1 activity in steatotic fld livers has not been assessed. We found that PAP-1 activity actually tended to be increased in post-natal day 8 (P8) fld mouse liver compared with littermate controls (Fig. 1B), confirming that this pathway is operative and that lipin 1 is not required for full PAP-1 activity. Hepatic DG acyltransferase activity was also unchanged in fld liver. We next sought to analyze levels of hepatic lipid species downstream of lipin 1 in the Kennedy pathway by using ESI-MS. These analyses confirmed that total TG content was increased 20-fold in homozygous fld mouse liver at P8 compared with littermate control (WT) mice (Fig. 1C). The increase in TG content in fld mice was observed across all major TG species (supplemental Table 2). The content of other phospholipids derived from DG and, thus, downstream of PAP-1 (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine (Fig. 1C and data not shown) were unchanged. We next evaluated levels of lipid intermediates upstream of lipin 1 in the TG synthesis pathway. Surprisingly, the hepatic content of the PAP-1 substrate phosphatidic acid (PA) was markedly depleted in lipin 1-deficient livers (Fig. 2A). Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) levels were also significantly diminished in fld liver (Fig. 2B). This was due primarily to depletion of the most abundant PA and PG species (Fig. 2, A and B). Cardiolipin (CL), which is derived from PG, was also strikingly depleted in fld liver (Fig. 2C). PAP-1 activity is not required for the conversion of PA to PG or CL, and thus, depletion of these phospholipids is likely caused by diminished availability of PA. Conversely, phosphatidylinositol (PI) levels were unchanged between WT (4.18 ± 0.55 nmol/mg of protein) and fld (4.63 ± 0.49 nmol/mg of protein) mice. Lipin 2 Is a Hepatic-enriched Lipin Family Member-Given the preservation of PAP-1 activity in fld liver, we next sought to characterize the regulation and function of other lipin family proteins. Whereas expression of Lpin2 is quite high, the expression of Lpin3 mRNA was undetectable in liver by northern blotting analyses (Fig. 3A). When probed against mouse tissue lysates, antibodies raised against lipin 2 peptides detected a band in liver (Fig. 3B) that co-migrates with lipin 2 protein overexpressed via an adenovirus (data not shown). Other tissues that were examined were practically devoid of lipin 2 protein. Lipin 1 is a soluble protein that can also be localized to the nucleus or associate with endoplasmic reticulum membranes (1Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Kumar A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

To determine the subcellular localization of lipin 2 in intact mouse liver, hepatic lysates were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (19Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Tzekov A. Croce M.A. Gropler M.C. Varma V. Yao-Borengasser A. Rasouli N. Kern P.A. Finck B.N. Bickel P.E. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To reflect the absolute quantity of lipin 2 in the liver, the resulting fractions were loaded by volume so that the total protein loaded in each lane varied (as noted above the representative image in Fig. 3C). Lipin 2 localization was then evaluated by comparison with markers of the subcellular compartments including the lipid droplet (ADRP), soluble (liver fatty acid-binding protein), endoplasmic reticulum membrane (calnexin), and nuclear (acetylated histone H3) fractions. Small amounts of lipin 2 were detected in lipid droplet, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and nuclear fractions (Fig. 3C). However, the majority of lipin 2 was detected in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3C). This soluble fraction also contains the highest levels of lipin 2 protein when equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane (Fig. 3D). Similar to lipin 1 (6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A.

Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rochford J.J. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29166-29174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The serine 106 residue of lipin 1 is a major site of phosphorylation (6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Kumar A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and the peptide sequence surrounding this site is conserved with lipin 2 (supplemental Fig. 1B). We confirmed that an antibody directed against phosphorylated serine 106 of lipin 1 also detected lipin 2 (supplemental Fig. 1B). Like lipin 1, the majority of phosphoserine 106 lipin 2 was detected in the soluble fraction of the liver lysates (Fig. 3D). Indeed, the majority of the phosphoserine 106 lipin 2 was found in the soluble fraction regardless of whether the gel was loaded for equal volume of the fractions or equal amounts of protein per lane (Fig. 3D). This suggests that under these conditions, the majority of lipin 2 protein is found in the cytoplasm but leaves open the possibility that, like lipin 1 (6Harris T.E. Huffman T.A. Chi A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), lipin 2 might translocate intracellularly in response to post-translational modification. Lipin 2 Protein Is Increased in fld Mouse Liver via a Post-transcriptional Mechanism-Consistent with previous work (9Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Reue K. J. Biol.

Biol. 2008; 28: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), Lpin2 mRNA expression was not changed in liver of P8 or P42 fld mice compared with littermate controls (Fig. 4A). However, lipin 2 protein content was increased severalfold in fld mice of either age (Fig. 4A). Moreover, at P42, loss of a single Lpin1 allele resulted in a significant increase in lipin 2 protein without affecting Lpin2 mRNA levels. The increase in lipin 2 protein levels in primary hepatocytes from fld mice is also preserved after several days in culture (data not shown). These data suggest that lipin 2 protein content is increased in fld liver independent of changes in steady-state Lpin2 mRNA levels. We, therefore, sought to evaluate lipin 2 synthesis rates and turnover in pulse-chase experiments using metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine. As shown in Fig. 4B, the rate of disappearance of 35S-labeled lipin 2 was equal in hepatocytes isolated from WT and fld mice. However, the rate of lipin 2 synthesis in 30-min metabolic labeling studies (lower autoradiographs in Fig. 4B) was increased in fld hepatocytes, suggesting that the disconnect between mRNA and protein is due to increased rates of translation. Lipin 2 Is Dynamically Regulated in Liver but Is Not a Target Gene of PGC-1α-The hepatic expression of Lpin1 is dramatically increased by 24 h of fasting (7Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Similarly, both lipin 2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly induced by food deprivation (Fig. 5A), suggesting that lipin 2 levels are also under transcriptional control. Our original interest in lipin 1 stemmed from the finding that the fasting-induced increase in Lpin1 expression required an intact PGC-1α pathway in liver (7Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, hepatic Lpin2 expression was induced equally in WT and PGC-1α-deficient mice (Fig. 5B). Moreover, although Lpin1 expression is robustly activated by PGC-1α overexpression in hepatocytes, Lpin2 mRNA and lipin 2 protein were not changed after PGC-1α overexpression (Fig. 5C). Thus, the regulatory circuits that govern hepatic Lpin1 and Lpin2 expression are notably divergent. Lipin 2 Is an Important PAP-1 En"
https://openalex.org/W2013509436,"We previously reported that Frizzled homologue 10 (FZD10), a member of the Wnt signal receptor family, was highly and specifically upregulated in synovial sarcoma and played critical roles in its cell survival and growth. We here report a possible molecular mechanism of the FZD10 signaling in synovial sarcoma cells. We found a significant enhancement of phosphorylation of the Dishevelled (Dvl)2/Dvl3 complex as well as activation of the Rac1–JNK cascade in synovial sarcoma cells in which FZD10 was overexpressed. Activation of the FZD10–Dvls–Rac1 pathway induced lamellipodia formation and enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth cells. FZD10 overexpression also caused the destruction of the actin cytoskeleton structure, probably through the downregulation of the RhoA activity. Our results have strongly implied that FZD10 transactivation causes the activation of the non-canonical Dvl–Rac1–JNK pathway and plays critical roles in the development/progression of synovial sarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W2080658126,"Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is required for adipocyte differentiation, but its role in mature adipocytes is less clear. Here, we report that knockdown of PPARgamma expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes returned the expression of most adipocyte genes to preadipocyte levels. Consistently, down-regulated but not up-regulated genes showed strong enrichment of PPARgamma binding. Surprisingly, not all adipocyte genes were reversed, and the adipocyte morphology was maintained for an extended period after PPARgamma depletion. To explain this, we focused on transcriptional regulators whose adipogenic regulation was not reversed upon PPARgamma depletion. We identified GATA2, a transcription factor whose down-regulation early in adipogenesis is required for preadipocyte differentiation and whose levels remain low after PPARgamma knockdown. Forced expression of GATA2 in mature adipocytes complemented PPARgamma depletion and impaired adipocyte functionality with a more preadipocyte-like gene expression profile. Ectopic expression of GATA2 in adipose tissue in vivo had a similar effect on adipogenic gene expression. These results suggest that PPARgamma-independent down-regulation of GATA2 prevents reversion of mature adipocytes after PPARgamma depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1963938060,"The mechanisms remain uncertain by which mutations in CFTR cause lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). Teichgräber et al. recently reported increased ceramide in CF lungs, which was proposed to result from defective lysosomal acidification in airway epithelial cells and consequent impairment of pH-dependent ceramide-metabolizing enzymes (Teichgräber, V., Ulrich, M., Endlich, N., Reithmüller, J., Wilker, B., Conceição Ce Olivereira-Munding, C., van Heeckeren, A.

Here, we measured lysosomal pH in several CFTR-expressing and -deficient cell lines, freshly isolated airway epithelial cells from non-CF and CF mice and humans, and well-differentiated primary cultures of human non-CF and CF airway epithelial cells. Lysosomal pH was measured by ratio imaging using a fluorescent pH indicator consisting of 40-kDa dextran conjugated to Oregon Green 488 and tetramethylrhodamine. In all cell types, lysosomal pH was approximately 4.5, unaffected by the thiazolidinone CFTR inhibitor CFTR(inh)-172, and increased to approximately 6.5 following bafilomycin inhibition of the vacuolar proton pump. Lysosomal pH did not differ significantly in airway epithelial cells from non-CF versus CF humans or mice. Our results provide direct evidence against the conclusions of Teichgräber et al. that lysosomal acidification is CFTR-dependent, impaired in CF, or responsible for ceramide accumulation. As such, alternative mechanisms are needed to explain increased ceramide in CF airways. Non-CFTR mechanisms, such as ClC-type chloride channels, are likely involved in maintaining electroneutrality during organellar acidification."

In vitro, selective uptake from EL-modified HDL was 129% higher than selective uptake from control HDL in SR-BI-overexpressing cells (p = 0.01). In vivo overexpression of human EL by means of recombinant adenovirus decreased HDL plasma levels significantly (p < 0.01). Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that EL expression resulted in the generation of small pre-β HDL particles in wild-type mice, whereas in SR-BI–/– mice small HDL were preferentially removed. In kinetic experiments the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of HDL cholesteryl ester increased by 110% (p < 0.001), and the FCR of HDL apolipoproteins increased by 64% (p < 0.001) in response to EL overexpression in wild-type mice. In SR-BI–/– mice a similar increase in the HDL apolipoprotein FCR occurred (p < 0.001); however, there was no further increase in HDL cholesteryl ester catabolism.

The factors responsible for the considerable variation in HDL cholesterol plasma levels are still incompletely understood. However, metabolic studies of HDL and apoA-I in humans have established that the substantial variation in their levels is primarily due to variation in the rate of apoA-I catabolism (3Rader D.J. J.

Although the selective uptake by SR-BI might play a central role in the remodeling of HDL (20Webb N.R. de Beer M.C. Asztalos B.F. Whitaker N. van der Westhuyzen D.R. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1666-1673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the dependence of EL-mediated remodeling and catabolism of HDL on functional SR-BI expression has not been experimentally addressed thus far. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the requirement of SR-BI for the effects of EL-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis on HDL metabolism in vivo by overexpressing human EL in wild-type and SR-BI knock-out mice. Our results indicate that SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester represents a key component of the remodeling of large HDL particles by EL. Animals-C57BL/6J control mice were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). SR-BI knock-out mice were obtained from Jackson (Bar Harbor, ME) and backcrossed to the C57BL/6J genetic background for a total of eight generations. The animals were kept in animal rooms with alternating 12-h periods of light (from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and dark (from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), with ad libitum access to water and mouse chow diet (Arie Blok, Woerden, The Netherlands). The animal experiments were performed in accordance with the national laws. All of the protocols were approved by the responsible ethics committees of the Landesamt für Gesundheit, Ernährung und technische Sicherheit Berlin and the University of Groningen. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses-The human EL cDNA was amplified from HepG2 cells (ATCC via LGC Promochem, Teddington, UK) by PCR using specific primers according to the human EL sequence (NM_006033, Gen-Bank™) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Recombinant adenovirus (AdhEL) was generated using the Adeno-X kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions. An empty adenovirus (AdNull) was used as control. Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified and purified as described previously (21Tietge U.J.F. Maugeais C. Lund-Katz S. Grass D. deBeer F.C. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The in vivo experiments described were carried out on day 5 following injection of the recombinant adenoviruses using a total dose of 1× 10E11 particles for each mouse. In the case of EL expressing adenovirus, 3× 10E10 particles thereof consisted of AdhEL. This dose of AdhEL has been confirmed in pilot experiments to cause an intermediate decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol levels in control mice. Expression of human EL was checked by quantitative real time PCR (see below) as well as by Western blot and activity assays performed on post-heparin plasma. Post-heparin plasma was generated as described (8Maugeais C. Tietge U.J.F. Broedl U.C. Marchadier D. Cain W. McCoy M.G. Lund-Katz S. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Western blots for EL were carried out using a commercially available polyclonal rabbit antihuman EL antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) to visualize EL followed by the appropriate secondary antibody. Phospholipase activity assays were performed using a 1,2-dithio analog of diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as a substrate, resulting in the liberation of free thiols by the hydrolytic activity of EL that were subsequently detected using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Plasma Lipid and Lipoprotein Analysis-The mice were bled from the retroorbital plexus after a 4-h fast using heparinized capillary tubes. Aliquots of plasma were stored at –20 °C until analysis. Plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids were measured enzymatically using commercially available reagents (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Neuss, Germany). Pooled plasma samples were subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration using a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) as described (22Tietge U.J.F. Maugeais C. Cain W. Grass D.

Individual fractions were assayed for cholesterol concentrations as described above. To assess α and pre-β HDL, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed using the Paragon electrophoresis system (Beckman Instruments, Brea, CA). Briefly, 3 μl of plasma were electrophoresed and blotted by absorption onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with the respective first antibodies to detect apoA-I (goat anti-mouse apoA-I; Biodesign, Saco, ME) and apoE (rabbit anti-mouse apoE; Biodesign, Saco, ME) followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies. For the analysis of HDL composition, HDL was isolated from 100 μl of mouse plasma by tabletop sequential ultracentrifugation (1.063 < d < 1.21) as described (22Tietge U.J.F. Maugeais C. Cain W.

Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). Cell Culture and HDL Selective Uptake Experiments-LdlA cells lacking low density lipoprotein receptor expression as well as LdlA cells stably transfected with a murine SR-BI cDNA (LdlA[mSR-BI]) were kindly provided by Dr. Monty Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and cultured as described (23Tietge U.J.F.

For HDL uptake experiments, 5% lipoprotein-depleted serum was used. Ten μg/ml of 125I/3H-CE HDL isolated and radioactively labeled as described below was added to the cells. After a 5-h incubation, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. Tracer uptake was calculated as counts recovered from the cells as a percentage of the total dose (counts from cells added to the counts from media). Selective HDL CE uptake was determined by subtracting the percentage of the total dose of 125I recovered from the cells from the percentage of the total dose of 3H recovered from the cells. HDL Kinetic Studies-Autologous HDL isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (density, 1.063 < d < 1.21) was prepared from pooled mouse plasma and labeled with 125I-tyramine-cellobiose and cholesteryl hexadecyl ether (cholesteryl-1,2-3H; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) essentially as described (24Tietge U.J.F. Maugeais C. Cain W. Rader D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E403-E411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and 1 μCi of the 125I-tyramine-cellobiose-HDL and 1 million dpm of the 3H-CE-HDL were injected via the tail vein. Plasma decay curves for both tracers were generated by dividing the plasma radioactivity at each time point by the radioactivity at the initial 5-min time point after tracer injection. Fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) were determined from the area under the plasma disappearance curves fitted to a bicompartmental model by use of the SAAM II program (22Tietge U.J.F. Maugeais C. Cain W. Grass D. Glick J.M. de Beer F.C. Rader D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The use of 3H-cholesteryl ether affects neither turnover rates in vivo nor SR-BI-mediated uptake of the label into LdlA[mSR-BI] cells in vitro compared with 3H cholesteryl ester-labeled HDL (data not shown). Organ uptake of HDL apolipoproteins (125I) and HDL-CEs (3H-cholesteryl ether) was determined and expressed as a percentage of the injected dose calculated by multiplying the initial plasma counts (5-min time point) with the estimated plasma volume (3.5% of total body weight). Selective uptake into organs was determined as the percentage of the injected dose of 125I-HDL recovered in each organ subtracted from the percentage of the injected dose of 3H-HDL-CE corrected for tissue weight. Analysis of Gene Expression by Real Time Quantitative PCR-Total RNA from mouse livers was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified with a NanoDrop ND-100 UV-visible spectrophotometer. cDNA synthesis was performed from 1 μg of total RNA using reagents from Applied Biosystems (Darmstadt, Germany). Real time quantitative PCR was carried out on an ABI-Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) sequence detector with the default settings. PCR primers and fluorogenic probes were designed with the Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). mRNA expression levels presented were calculated relative to the average of the housekeeping gene cyclophilin and further normalized to the relative expression level of the respective controls (wild-type mice receiving the control adenovirus AdNull). Statistical Analysis-Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare different groups. Statistical significance for all comparisons was assigned at p < 0.05. EL Modification Increases SR-BI-mediated Selective Uptake of HDL Cholesteryl Ester in Vitro-To test the hypothesis that cholesteryl ester within EL-modified HDL are more susceptible toward SR-BI-mediated selective uptake, HDL was isolated from AdNull as well as AdhEL injected wild-type mice, radiolabeled with 125I-tyramine cellobiose and 3H-cholesteryl ether, and incubated in vitro with LdlA cells stably transfected with a murine SR-BI cDNA. In these cells, selective uptake from EL-modified HDL was more than 2-fold higher than selective uptake from control HDL (28 ± 6 versus 64 ± 7%/plate, p = 0.01; Fig. 1). In control LdlA cells not expressing SR-BI, no appreciable selective uptake occurred from either HDL preparation (data not shown). EL Expression Differentially Impacts on HDL Particle Size in Wild-type and SR-BI Knock-out Mice-To investigate the impact of SR-BI-mediated selective uptake on the remodeling of HDL by EL in vivo, we overexpressed EL in wild-type and SR-BI knock-out mice. There was no difference in EL expression levels between wild-type and SR-BI knock-out mice in response to AdhEL injection either in hepatic mRNA expression (data not shown) or post-heparin EL protein plasma levels as judged by Western blot (data not shown) or post-heparin phospholipase activity (wild type, 263 ± 11; SR-BI knock-out, 280 ± 12 nmol/min/ml). Overexpression of EL in wild-type controls resulted in a 54% reduction in plasma cholesterol levels compared with AdNull-injected animals (85 ± 8 versus 39 ± 11 mg/dl, p < 0.01; Fig. 2A). Similarly, AdhEL injection resulted in a 55% decrease in plasma cholesterol levels in SR-BI knock-out mice compared with SR-BI knock-out mice receiving the control virus AdNull (229 ± 12 versus 104 ± 18 mg/dl, p < 0.001; Fig. 2A). Plasma phospholipids were reduced by 53% in wild-type mice by EL overexpression (211 ± 9 versus 100 ± 14 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and by 52% in SR-BI knock-out mice (283 ± 13 versus 137 ± 16 mg/dl, p < 0.001). Plasma triglycerides were unchanged in wild-type mice receiving AdhEL (77 ± 6 versus 68 ± 9 mg/dl, n.s.) and decreased significantly in SR-BI knockout mice receiving AdhEL compared with AdNull-treated SR-BI knock-out controls (130 ± 14 versus 71 ± 6 mg/dl, p = 0.01). Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis indicated that EL differentially affected the size distribution of HDL in wild-type mice compared with SR-BI knock-out mice. Although in C57BL/6 mice EL resulted preferentially in the removal of larger sized HDL (Fig. 2B), in SR-BI knock-out mice preferentially larger sized HDL particles remained (Fig. 2C). To further confirm these results, HDL was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Staining for apoA-I revealed that in wild-type mice preferentially α-migrating particles were decreased by EL overexpression (Fig. 2D), and the apparent α to pre-β size distribution was reversed by EL overexpression. However, in SR-BI knock-out mice, a large portion of α-migrating particles was not remodeled, and the α to pre-β HDL size distribution indicated that still the majority of the particles exhibited an α migration pattern (Fig. 2D). Staining for apoE indicated that in wild-type mice apoE-containing α HDL particles were almost completely removed by EL expression (Fig. 2E), whereas in SR-BI knock-out mice overexpressing EL, a substantial part of apoE-containing HDL remained, indicating that SR-BI might be required for remodeling of these particles. EL Expression Differentially Impacts on HDL Composition in Wild-type and SR-BI Knock-out Mice-Overexpression of EL resulted in dramatic changes of HDL composition in wild-type mice. Consistent with the role of EL as phospholipase, HDL phospholipid content decreased significantly (p < 0.001; Table 1) as did HDL cholesteryl ester content (p < 0.001; Table 1). On the other hand, HDL triglyceride content (p < 0.001; Table 1) as well as protein content (p < 0.001; Table 1) increased in EL modified HDL. Free cholesterol content remained unaltered (Table 1). These data are consistent with the generation of smaller HDL particles in response to EL overexpression in wild-type mice.TABLE 1HDL composition in wild-type and SR-BI knock-out mice in response to EL overexpressionC57BL/6SR-BI knock-outAdNullAdhELAdNullAdhEL%%%%Cholesterol ester16 ± 28 ± 1aAt least p < 0.05.13 ± 211 ± 2Free cholesterol3 ± 13 ± 110 ± 215 ± 2aAt least p < 0.05.Phospholipids20 ± 29 ± 1aAt least p < 0.05.22 ± 219 ± 2Triglycerides3 ± 110 ± 1aAt least p < 0.05.3 ± 15 ± 1aAt least p < 0.05.Protein58 ± 370 ± 4aAt least p < 0.05.52 ± 350 ± 4a At least p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab However, in SR-BI knock-out mice a less substantial shift in HDL composition was noticed following injection of the EL expressing adenovirus. Phospholipid, cholesteryl ester as well as protein content remained unchanged (Table 1), whereas triglyceride (p = 0.01; Table 1) and free cholesterol content (p < 0.001; Table 1) increased as a result of EL modification of the HDL particle in this model. EL Overexpression Significantly Increases the Rate of HDL Cholesteryl Ester Degradation as a Function of SR-BI Expres-sion-The above data indicated that the effects of EL overexpression on HDL metabolism exhibit substantial differences in mice lacking SR-BI receptors compared with wild-type controls. To further elucidate the underlying metabolic basis of these findings, HDL kinetic studies were performed. In AdNull-injected wild-type mice, the FCR of HDL cholesteryl ester was almost twice as high as the FCR of HDL protein, indicating the presence of functional in vivo selective uptake (0.083 ± 0.008 versus 0.158 ± 0.02 pools/h, p < 0.001; Fig. 3A). In contrast, although having comparable FCRs for HDL protein catabolism, HDL cholesteryl ester catabolism in SR-BI knock-out mice administered AdNull was not increased, confirming the absence of selective uptake in this model (0.088 ± 0.01 versus 0.077 ± 0.01 pools/h, n.s.; Fig. 3B). EL overexpression in wild-type mice resulted in a 64% increase in the HDL protein FCR (0.136 ± 0.03 pools/h, p < 0.001; Fig. 3A), whereas the HDL cholesteryl ester FCR increased by 110% (0.332 ± 0.04 pools/h, p < 0.001; Fig. 3A). The apparent whole body selective uptake from EL-modified HDL calculated as the difference between the HDL CE and the HDL protein FCRs was therefore almost 3-fold higher than the uptake from control HDL. These data confirm in vivo the results of the in vitro experiments described above that EL modification of HDL increases SR-BI-mediated selective uptake. EL overexpression in SR-BI knock-out mice caused a similar increase in the HDL protein FCR by 64% (0.144 ± 0.026 pools/h, p < 0.001; Fig. 3B). In contrast, the HDL cholesteryl ester FCR was increased, however, comparably with the HDL protein FCR (0.138 ± 0.031, p < 0.001; Fig. 3B). Therefore, in the absence of SR-BI whole body selective uptake from EL-modified HDL is not increased. These data also indicate that besides stimulating selective uptake, EL modification of HDL results in increased whole body HDL holoparticle uptake. EL Overexpression Significantly Alters the Tissue Catabolism of HDL Dependent on Functional SR-BI Expression-The liver is a main organ in HDL catabolism. In AdNull-injected wild-type mice, 17 ± 2% of the injected protein dose and 41 ± 5% of the injected cholesteryl ester dose were taken up by the liver (Fig. 4A), resulting in an apparent selective uptake of 24 ± 4% (Fig. 4C). This selective uptake is essentially due to the expression of SR-BI, because in AdNull-injected SR-BI knock-out mice, the hepatic HDL protein uptake (19 ± 2%; Fig. 4B) did not differ from the HDL cholesteryl ester uptake (20 ± 3%; Fig. 4B), resulting in no appreciable net selective uptake (2 ± 1%; Fig. 4C). EL overexpression in wild-type mice increased HDL protein as well as HDL cholesteryl ester uptake significantly (38 ± 6 and 78 ± 10%, respectively, p < 0.01; Fig. 4A), resulting in increased EL-mediated hepatic selective uptake (40 ± 7%, p < 0.01; Fig. 4C). In contrast, in SR-BI knock-out mice EL stimulated hepatic HDL protein catabolism and HDL cholesteryl ester catabolism to a similar extent (48 ± 4 and 47 ± 8%, respectively, n.s.; Fig. 4B) translating into absent selective uptake (–2 ± 1%; Fig. 4C). These data indicate that the increase in hepatic selective uptake mediated by EL in wild-type mice was due to functional SR-BI expression. However, as evidenced in the SR-BI knock-out model, EL also has the potential to mediate increased holoparticle uptake into the liver. The kidneys are mainly responsible for the catabolism of small poorly lipidated apoA-I molecules. This is underlined in AdNull administered wild-type controls by an apparent uptake of HDL protein (5.1 ± 0.4%; Fig. 4D), whereas uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester is almost absent (0.5 ± 0.1%; Fig. 4D). In this process SR-BI does not play a direct role, resulting in renal uptake of HDL protein (5.4 ± 0.7%; Fig. 4E) and HDL cholesteryl ester (0.4 ± 0.2%; Fig. 4E) in AdNull-injected SR-BI knock-out mice comparable with the results obtained in wild-type mice. Therefore, negative selective uptake into the kidneys (relatively more protein catabolism over cholesteryl ester catabolism) was similar in AdNull-injected wild-type and SR-BI knock-out mice (–4.6 ± 0.5 versus –5.0 ± 0.7%, respectively; Fig. 4F). EL overexpression in wild-type mice resulted in a dramatic increase in HDL protein uptake into the kidneys (16 ± 2%, p < 0.001; Fig. 4D), whereas HDL cholesteryl ester uptake was almost unchanged (0.6 ± 0.2%, n.s.; Fig. 4D). Therefore, renal negative selective uptake was increased more than 3-fold in response to EL overexpression in wild-type mice (–15.4 ± 1.9%, p < 0.001; Fig. 4F). On the other hand, catabolism of HDL protein by the kidneys in response to EL overexpression was also increased in SR-BI knock-out mice (10.5 ± 1.5%, p < 0.001; Fig. 4E), whereas HDL cholesteryl ester uptake was not different compared with AdNull-injected SR-BI knock-outs (0.6 ± 0.2%, n.s.; Fig. 4E). However, net negative selective uptake stimulated by EL overexpression was less than 2-fold (–9.9 ± 1.2%, p < 0.001; Fig. 4F) and therefore clearly less (p < 0.01) than the increase observed in wild-type mice injected with AdhEL. The Hepatic Expression Pattern of Genes Involved in HDL Remodeling Does Not Change in Response to EL Overexpression in Wild-type and SR-BI Knock-out Mice-To investigate potential EL-induced alterations in gene expression levels, we determined hepatic mRNA levels of a number of other proteins involved in HDL remodeling by rea"
https://openalex.org/W2058289105,"The function of Synaptotagmin IV (Syt IV) in vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release is debated, as Syt IV does not bind calcium. Here, Zhang et al. show that Syt IV localizes to the vesicles of neuropeptide-secreting nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary and regulates the kinetics of calcium-triggered exocytosis. Many members of the synaptotagmin (Syt) protein family bind Ca2+ and trigger exocytosis, but some Syt proteins appear to have no Ca2+-dependent actions and their biological functions remain obscure. Syt IV is an activity-induced brain protein with no known Ca2+-dependent interactions and its subcellular localization and biological functions have sparked considerable controversy. We found Syt IV on both micro- and dense-core vesicles in posterior pituitary nerve terminals in mice. In terminals from Syt IV knockout mice compared with those from wild types, low Ca2+ entry triggered more exocytosis, high Ca2+ entry triggered less exocytosis and endocytosis was accelerated. In Syt IV knockouts, dense-core and microvesicle fusion was enhanced in cell-attached patches and dense-core vesicle fusion pores had conductances that were half as large as those in wild types. Given the neuroendocrine functions of the posterior pituitary, changes in Syt IV levels could be involved in endocrine transitions involving alterations in the release of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W2074172261,"The vacuoles of pea (Pisum sativum) leaves and red beet (Beta vulgaris) storage root are major sites for the intracellular compartmentation of folates. In the light of these findings and preliminary experiments indicating that some plant multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) subfamily ATP-binding cassette transporters are able to transport compounds of this type, the Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar MRP, AtMRP1 (AtABCC1), and its functional equivalent(s) in vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from red beet storage root were studied. In so doing, it has been determined that heterologously expressed AtMRP1 and its equivalents in red beet vacuolar membranes are not only competent in the transport of glutathione conjugates but also folate monoglutamates and antifolates as exemplified by pteroyl-l-glutamic acid and methotrexate (MTX), respectively. In agreement with the results of these in vitro transport measurements, analyses of atmrp1 T-DNA insertion mutants of Arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskia and Columbia disclose an MTX-hypersensitive phenotype. atmrp1 knock-out mutants are more sensitive than wild-type plants to growth retardation by nanomolar concentrations of MTX, and this is associated with impaired vacuolar antifolate sequestration. The vacuoles of protoplasts isolated from the leaves of Wassilewskia atmrp1 mutants accumulate 50% less [(3)H]MTX than the vacuoles of protoplasts from wild-type plants when incubated in media containing nanomolar concentrations of this antifolate, and vacuolar membrane-enriched vesicles purified from the mutant catalyze MgATP-dependent [(3)H]MTX uptake at only 40% of the capacity of the equivalent membrane fraction from wild-type plants. AtMRP1 and its counterparts in other plant species therefore have the potential for participating in the vacuolar accumulation of folates and related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2151391522,"Circulating progenitor cells home to and engraft to sites of ischemia, mediated in part by the adhesion molecule L-selectin; however, accumulation in tissues such as the heart is low. In this study, an acellular collagen-based matrix containing sialyl Lewis(X) (sLe(X)), which binds L-selectin, was developed in order to enhance the endogenous progenitor cell therapeutic response. Its effect on progenitor cells and angiogenesis were assessed in vitro and using a hindlimb ischemia model with rats. In culture, the sLe(X)-collagen matrix recruited more CD133(+)CD34(+)L-selectin(+) cells than collagen-only matrix, with adhesion mediated by L-selectin binding. Increased angiogenic/chemotactic cytokine production and improved resistance to apoptosis appeared in cells cultured on sLe(X)-collagen matrix. In vivo, mobilization of endogenous circulating progenitor cells was increased, and greater recruitment of these and systemically injected human peripheral blood CXCR4(+)L-selectin(+) cells to sLe(X)-collagen treated limbs was observed compared to collagen-only. This condition was associated with differences in angiogenic/chemotactic cytokine levels, with greater arteriole density and increased perfusion in sLe(X)-collagen treated hindlimbs. With these factors taken together, we demonstrated that an acellular matrix-bound ligand approach can enhance the mobilization, recruitment, and therapeutic effects of endogenous and/or transplanted progenitor cells, possibly through paracrine and antiapoptotic mechanisms, and could be used to improve cell-based regenerative therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2092719617,"The apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) cytidine deaminase genes encode a set of enzymes including APOBEC1 (A1), APOBEC2 (A2), APOBEC4 (A4), and APOBEC3A-H (A3A-H). Although each possesses one or more zinc binding motifs conserved among enzymes catalyzing C-->U conversion, the functions and substrate specificities of these gene products vary considerably. For example, although two closely related enzymes, A3F and A3G, both restrict HIV-1 infection in strains deficient in virus infectivity factor (vif), A3F selectively deaminates cytosine within 5'-TTCA-3' motifs in single stranded DNA, whereas A3G targets 5'-CCCA-3' sequences. In the present study we have used nucleoside analog interference mapping to probe A3G-DNA interactions throughout the enzyme-substrate complex as well as to determine which DNA structural features determine substrate specificity. Our results indicate that multiple components of nucleosides within the consensus sequence are important for substrate recognition by A3G (with base moieties being most critical), whereas deamination interference by analog substitution outside this region is minimal. Furthermore, exocyclic groups in pyrimidines 1-2 nucleotides 5' of the target cytosine were shown to dictate substrate recognition by A3G, with chemical composition at ring positions 3 and 4 found to be more important than at ring position 5. Taken together, these results provide insights into how the enzyme selects A3G hotspot motifs for deamination as well as which approaches might be best suited for forming a stable, catalytically competent cross-linked A3G-DNA complex for future structural studies."

It is not yet clear how these growth factors are regulated. We tested the hypothesis that the growth factors responsible for regulating cartilage are themselves regulated by growth factors.

The results may help guide the application of growth factors to articular cartilage repair. Damaged articular cartilage is responsible for considerable disability in the form of arthritis and joint trauma (1Praemer A. Furner S. Rice D.P. Musculoskeletal Conditions in the United States. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rosemont, IL1999: 3-39Google Scholar). Articular chondrocytes have a poor intrinsic repair capacity. Once articular cartilage substance is lost, the damage is generally permanent, and is often progressive (2Buckwalter J.A. Mankin H.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Polypeptide growth factors play a central role in articular chondrocyte function. Several anabolic and mitogenic factors have been identified that help maintain cartilage homeostasis in normal joints. These factors include insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), 2The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; TGF, transforming growth factor; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (3Trippel S.B.

We tested the hypothesis that growth factors known to be anabolic for articular chondrocytes regulate their own expression and that of other anabolic growth factors. We tested this hypothesis using IGF-I, FGF-2, and TGF-β1. We found that these growth factors, acting individually, differentially regulate each other. We further found that, in concert, they selectively interact to regulate each other both at the level of gene expression and protein production. Cell Culture Reagents-Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine were from Invitrogen. Ascorbic acid and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Basal medium was prepared with DMEM, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Complete medium was prepared with basal medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human recombinant IGF-I was purchased from Peprotech Inc (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human recombinant FGF-2 and TGF-β1 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Chondrocyte Isolation and Culture-Bovine articular chondrocytes were isolated as previously described (27Madry H. Trippel S.B. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, articular cartilage was harvested from fresh, 1-year-old bovine carpal joints and digested in complete medium supplemented with 0.1% collagenase type I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). After 16 h, the suspension was filtered through 100-μm mesh cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), and isolated chondrocytes were washed twice and suspended in complete medium. Chondrocytes were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well in 4 ml of complete medium. After 3 days, cells were washed, cultured in basal medium for 2 days, and then fresh basal medium for one additional day. The medium was then changed to basal medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and the designated growth factor(s). Basal medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin without growth factors was used as control. Cells were cultured for treatment durations of 20 min to 5 days without growth factor or medium replacement. Growth Factor Analysis by ELISA-Human IGF-I, human FGF-2, and human TGF-β1 DuoSet ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems. IGF-I and TGF-β1 were measured in cell culture medium. For TGF-β1 analysis, medium was pretreated with HCl to activate latent TGF-β1 and then neutralized with NaOH. No TGF-β1 was detected in medium without HCl pretreatment. No IGF-I was detected in the cell layer (data not shown). FGF-2 in the medium was less than 10% of the total FGF-2 production (data not shown) and was therefore measured in the cell layer by harvesting and sonicating cells in 0.5 ml of cell lysis buffer. The cell lysis buffer was prepared as previously described (28Fanning P.J. Emkey G. Smith R.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Szasz N. Trippel S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50940-50948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cell protein was determined by Bradford assay of the cell lysate. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-Total RNA was prepared from chondrocytes using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Chondrocytes were lysed with lysis buffer RLT (RNeasy Mini kit, Qiagen) and homogenized by passing 6 times through a 20-gauge needle. On-column DNase digestion was performed to remove any residual DNA. RNA concentration and purity were determined by optical density at 260 nm and 280 nm. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA with a reaction volume of 50 μl for 2 h using the High-capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and random primer. Reverse transcription was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 20 min. cDNA samples were diluted 1:20 for real-time PCR analysis, except for IGF-I mRNA analysis, for which cDNA samples were not diluted. Real-time PCR Analysis-Chondrocyte FGF-2 mRNA, IGF-I mRNA, and TGF-β1 mRNA were measured by real-time PCR using a Prism 7000 Sequence Detector System and TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen and probes were 5′-end FAM and 3′-end MGB nonfluorescent quencher (MGBNFQ) labeled and synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Table 1). The standard curve method was used to calculate the expression of target genes (IGF-I, FGF-2, and TGF-β1) and the content of 18S rRNA. At least five serial dilutions of cDNA were made to determine threshold cycle (CT) values, and CT values versus log of dilutions were used as the standard curve for each target gene and 18S rRNA. At all time points tested, IGF-I, FGF-2, and TGF-β1 did not alter 18S rRNA levels (data not shown). For this reason, gene expression data were normalized to 18S rRNA levels. At least three independent experiments were performed using different batches of articular chondrocytes obtained from different bovine joints at different times. Fold changes of target gene expression are expressed as the ratio of growth factor-treated samples to the untreated controls. Data are presented as the average of fold changes.TABLE 1Primers and probes used for real-time PCRGeneACC. no.PrimerProbe18SAF176811Forward: 5′-AGAAACGGCTACCACATCCAA-3′5′-AAGGCAGCAGGCGC-3′Reverse: 5′-GGGTCGGGAGTGGGTAATTT-3′FGF-2NM_174056Forward: 5′-TGGTATGTGGCACTGAAACGA-3′5′-CTGGGCAGTATAAACT-3′Reverse: 5′-TTCTGCCCAGGTCCTGTTTT-3′IGF-IAY277405Forward: 5′-CATCCTCCTCGCATCTCTTCTATC-3′5′-CCTGTGCTTGCTCG-3′Reverse: 5′-CGTGGCAGAGCTGGTGAA-3′TGF-β1M36271Forward: 5′-TGAGCCAGAGGCGGACTACT-3′5′-CAAGGAGGTCACCCGC-3′Reverse: 5′-TGCCGTATTCCACCATTAGCA-3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis-The effects of growth factor and time were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA used terms for growth factor, time, and the growth factor-by-time interaction, as well as a random effect to correlate data from the same experimental run. A second analysis, also using ANOVA, directly tested whether combining growth factors lead to synergistic or inhibitory effects. Synergistic effects were those for which the value of the combined growth factors was significantly greater than the sum of the effects of the individual growth factors. Inhibitory effects were those for which the value of the combined growth factors was significantly less than the sum of the effects of the individual growth factors. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To simplify the figures, p values are given in the text. FGF-2, IGF-I, and TGF-β1 Differentially Regulate Their Own Gene Expression-FGF-2 increased FGF-2 transcripts to a maximum of 2.7-fold (p < 0.001) at 12 h and then maintained a stimulation of 1.4–1.9-fold through the 5-day duration of these studies (p ≤ 0.022) (Fig. 1A). IGF-I had little effect on IGF-I expression (Fig. 2A). TGF-β1 increased its own gene expression < 1.7-fold from 2 h through 1 day (p ≤ 0.013 for all time points) and then produced a further time-dependent stimulation to 3.9-fold at 4 days (p = 0.016) (Fig. 3A).

FGF-2 Expression-IGF-I increased FGF-2 transcripts 1.5-fold by 2 h (p = 0.009). FGF-2 transcripts returned to baseline by 1 day. TGF-β1 stimulated a progressive, time-dependent increase of FGF-2 transcripts to 11.7-fold at 4 days (p = 0.008) (Fig. 1A). IGF-I Expression-FGF-2 decreased IGF-I transcripts in a progressive, time-dependent fashion to 4% of the baseline value by 1 day (p < 0.0001). This inhibition persisted at ∼10% of baseline for the remainder of the 5-day experiments (p < 0.001 for all time points). TGF-β1 exerted little effect during the first 12 h of exposure, but subsequently increased IGF-I expression to a maximum of 7.2-fold at 5 days (p = 0.009) (Fig. 2A). TGF-β1 Expression-FGF-2 increased TGF-β1 transcripts through 2 h, exerted little further effect through 1 day, and then further increased TGF-β1 transcripts to 4.6-fold at 2 days (p < 0.001). IGF-I produced a small (1.3–1.4-fold) increase in TGF-β1 expression from 6 h through 1 day (p ≤ 0.008), that returned to baseline thereafter (Fig. 3A). Detailed data are given in supplemental Table S1). Delivery of a Second Growth Factor Demonstrates Interactive Regulation of Growth Factor Gene Expression-Two growth factors were delivered simultaneously, and growth factor gene expression was compared with that generated by individual growth factors. FGF-2 Expression-FGF-2 and TGF-β1 synergistically stimulated FGF-2 expression from 2 h through 1 day. The effect of FGF-2 and TGF-β1 together was 1.3–1.9-fold greater than the sum of the effects of the two factors individually from 2 h through 1 day (p ≤ 0.015 for all time points). However, from 2 days to 5 days, FGF-2 reduced the stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on FGF-2 expression by 28–36% (p ≤ 0.005 for all time points). The addition of IGF-I to TGF-β1 modestly and transiently increased TGF-β1 stimulation of FGF-2 expression (1.4-fold) at 6 h (p = 0.005) and then markedly reduced the stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on FGF-2 expression (57–75%) from 1 day through 5 days (p < 0.0001 for all time points). IGF-I did not substantially alter the effect of FGF-2 on FGF-2 transcript levels (Fig. 1B). IGF-I Expression-The addition of FGF-2 to TGF-β1 reversed the stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on IGF-I gene expression. In combination, FGF-2 and TGF-β1 produced a time-dependent inhibition of IGF-I expression that closely paralleled the inhibitory action of FGF-2 alone. In contrast, the addition of IGF-I to TGF-β1 increased IGF-I transcripts synergistically after 1 day (p < 0.0001 for all time points). By 5 days, the effect of IGF-I and TGF-β1 together was 1.8-fold (p = 0.017) greater than the sum of the effects of the two factors individually. The inhibitory effect of FGF-2 on IGF-I expression was partially reversed by the addition of IGF-I to FGF-2, but only at 5 days (p = 0.015) (Fig. 2B). TGF-β1 Expression-The addition of IGF-I to FGF-2 produced a 1.3-fold increase (p = 0.003) in TGF-β1 transcripts at 6 h. The effect of IGF-I then became inhibitory, reducing the stimulatory effect of FGF-2 by 27–33% from 2 days through 4 days (p ≤ 0.004 for all time points). Thus, the combination of IGF-I and FGF-2 generated TGF-β1 transcript levels that were intermediate to those generated by each factor individually. Similarly, the addition of IGF-I to TGF-β1 increased TGF-β1 transcripts 1.4-fold from 6 h through 12 h (p < 0.001 for these two time points). Then, from 2 days through 5 days, IGF-I reduced the stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on TGF-β1 gene expression by 27–39% (p ≤ 0.004 for all time points). The combination [IGF-I + TGF-β1], as for the combination [IGF-I + FGF-2], generated TGF-β1 transcript levels that were intermediate to those generated by IGF-I and TGF-β1 individually. The combination [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] synergistically stimulated TGF-β1 expression at all time points after 1 day (Fig. 3B). Specifically, the effect of [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] was 1.2–1.5-fold greater than the sum of the effects of the individual factors from 2 days through 5 days (p ≤ 0.001 for all time points). Detailed data are given in supplemental Tables S2 and S3. Delivery of a Third Growth Factor Modulates the Effect of Growth Factor Pairs-All three growth factors were delivered simultaneously and growth factor gene expression was compared with that generated by growth factor pairs. FGF-2 Expression-The addition of IGF-I to the combination [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] inhibited FGF-2 expression in a time-dependent fashion from 12 h through 5 days (p ≤ 0.001 for all time points). By 5 days, IGF-I had reduced by 68% the stimulatory effect of [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] on FGF-2 expression (p < 0.0001). In contrast, the addition of TGF-β1 to [IGF-I + FGF-2] increased FGF-2 transcript levels at all time points tested (p ≤ 0.009) except 20 m. The addition of FGF-2 to the combination [IGF-I + TGF-β1] augmented the stimulatory effect of [IGF-I + TGF-β1] at all time points from 2 h through 12 h (p ≤ 0.006), but this effect was transient and disappeared by 1 day (Fig. 1B). IGF-I Expression-The addition of IGF-I to [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] gradually, but completely, overcame the inhibition of IGF-I expression by [FGF-2 + TGF-β1]. This restoration of IGF-I expression began at 1 day and achieved baseline levels at 4 days. The addition of TGF-β1 to [FGF-2 + IGF-I] also increased IGF-I expression at all time points from 2 days to 5 days (p ≤ 0.008). In contrast, the addition of FGF-2 to [IGF-I + TGF-β1] produced a marked downward shift in IGF-I transcript levels, overcoming the stimulatory effect of [IGF-I + TGF-β1] until day 4 when IGF-I transcript levels returned to baseline (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data suggest that FGF-2 and TGF-β1 exert opposing effects on IGF-I gene expression. TGF-β1 Expression-The addition of IGF-I to [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] markedly reduced TGF-β1 gene expression at all time points from 1 day to 5 days (p < 0.001). This reflects a partial abrogation by IGF-I of the synergistic actions of FGF-2 and TGF-β1 on TGF-β1 expression. Conversely, the addition of FGF-2 to [IGF-I + TGF-β1] increased TGF-β1 expression at all time points (p ≤ 0.023) except 20 m and 1 day. The addition of TGF-β1 to [IGF-I + FGF-2] caused a similar, though less marked, increase in TGF-β1 transcripts at all time points (p ≤ 0.015) except 20 m and 1 day (Fig. 3B). Detailed data are given in supplemental Tables S2 and S3. The Time Course of Growth Factor Regulation of Growth Factor Expression Differs Among Growth Factors-The effect of duration of growth factor treatment on growth factor gene expression was determined for individual and combinations of growth factors for treatment durations of 20 min to 5 days. FGF-2 Expression-In all groups, FGF-2 expression increased by 2 h and peaked between 2 and 12 h before declining until 1 days. After 1 day, FGF-2 expression again increased in all groups except the IGF-I treatment group, in which FGF-2 expression remained at a baseline level after 12 h. Only TGF-β1 produced a higher delayed peak (11.7-fold, p = 0.008) than early peak (4.3-fold, p = 0.0001) of FGF-2 expression. By 5 days, the second peak of FGF-2 expression had begun to decline in all groups (Fig. 1, A and B). IGF-I Expression-IGF-I expression responded more slowly than FGF-2 or TGF-β1 expression to growth factor treatment. The inhibitory effect of FGF-2, and of [FGF-2 + IGF-I], on IGF-I expression first appeared at 6 h. The stimulatory effect of TGF-β1, and of [IGF-I + TGF-β1] did not appear until 1 day and the addition of TGF-β1 to FGF-2 delayed the inhibitory effect of FGF-2 (Fig. 2B). Unlike FGF-2 alone (Fig. 2A), the inhibition by [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] and by [FGF-2 + IGF-I] showed a trend toward restoration by 5 days. In response to [IGF-I + FGF-2 + TGF-β1], IGF-I expression followed an inhibitory time course until 1 day, then progressively recovered to baseline at 4 days (p = 0.582) and became stimulatory to 1.5-fold of baseline at 5 days (p = 0.003) (Fig. 2B). Thus, the addition of IGF-I or TGF-β1 as a third regulator to [FGF-2 + TGF-β1] or [FGF-2 + IGF-I], accelerated the recovery of IGF-I gene expression from its inhibition by FGF-2 (Fig. 2B). TGF-β1 Expression-TGF-β1 expression increased by 2 h for every growth factor and growth factor combination tested except one (p ≤ 0.013), followed by a plateau through 1 day and by a second increase in TGF-β1 expression over the second 24-h period (Fig. 3, A and B). The exception was cells treated with IGF-I. IGF-I produced only a small (1.3–1.4-fold), transient (6 h through 1 day, p ≤ 0.008) increase (Fig. 3A). The second peaks of TGF-β1 expression, in contrast to those of FGF-2 expression, achieved similar or higher magnitude than the corresponding first peaks in all treatment groups except the IGF-I treatment group. This was especially pronounced for [FGF2 + TGF-β1], which generated a first peak of 2.9–3.2-fold from 2 h through 1 day (p ≤ 0.013) and a second of 7.7–9.5-fold from 2 days through 5 days (p ≤ 0.021) (Fig. 3B). Detailed data are given in supplemental Table S4. Relation between Regulatory Effects on Growth Factor Gene Expression and Growth Factor Protein Production-The effects of growth factors on the production of other growth factors were assessed by ELISA and compared with their effects on gene expression. FGF-2 Production-In dose response studies, IGF-I failed to increase FGF-2 production (data not shown). TGF-β1 increased FGF-2 in a dose-dependent manner to 12.2-fold at 100 ng/ml TGF-β1(p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4A). In time course studies, TGF-β1 increased FGF-2 after 12 h to a plateau of 7.4-fold at 4 days (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4B). The addition of IGF-I strongly inhibited TGF-β1-induced FGF-2 production (Fig. 4, C and D). These patterns of protein production closely parallel the patterns of FGF-2 transcripts in the gene expression studies. IGF-I Production-IGF-I in the medium was less than 200 pg/ml at 20 m and decreased with time in control and chondrocytes treated with FGF-2, 0–400 ng/ml or TGF-β1, 0–400 ng/ml (data not shown). This is consistent with the decrease in IGF-I transcripts caused by FGF-2. The increase in IGF-I transcripts generated by TGF-β1 was not reflected by an increase in IGF-I protein. TGF-β Production-In dose-response studies, IGF-I did not affect TGF-β1 production (data not shown). Thus, the small (1.3–1.4-fold), transient increase in TGF-β1 transcripts elicited by IGF-I was not reflected in a change in TGF-β1. FGF-2 increased TGF-β1 7.2-fold at 50 ng/ml FGF-2 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5A), consistent with its effects on TGF-β1 transcripts (Fig. 3A). In time-course studies, FGF-2 increased TGF-β1 6.6-fold at 5 days (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5B). This corresponds to an increase in TGF-β1 transcripts of >4.4-fold from 2 days to 4 days. The addition of IGF-I and FGF-2 generated an apparent additive effect on TGF-β1 production (Fig. 5C), but reduced TGF-β1 protein production (p = 0.002) when normalized to cell protein content (Fig. 5D) consistent with the reduction in TGF-β1 transcripts in the gene expression studies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of growth factor regulation of growth factor expression in articular chondrocytes. Prior studies have reported that IGF-I expression is stimulated (29Elford P.R. Lamberts S.W. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and inhibited (30Shida J.I. Jingushi S. Izumi T. Ikenoue T. Iwamoto Y. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) by FGF-2. In the present studies, FGF-2 reduced IGF-I transcripts to 7% by 12 h. In contrast, TGF-β1 increased IGF-I transcripts to 7.2-fold baseline values by 5 days. Thus, FGF-2 and TGF-β1 appear to be potent counter-regulators of IGF-I expression by these cells. When TGF-β1 and FGF-2 were given together, FGF-2 almost completely eliminated the marked stimulatory action of TGF-β1 on IGF-I gene expression. This suggests an additional level of regulation by TGF-β1 and FGF-2, one that determines the growth factor priority. In this case, the effect of FGF-2 took priority over the effect of TGF-β1. The finding that, by 5 days, TGF-β1 appears to have begun to override this inhibition by FGF-2, suggests that the interaction between FGF-2 and TGF-β1 may be time-limited. TGF-β1 has been previously reported to inhibit IGF-I expression (29Elford P.R. Lamberts S.W. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Tsukazaki T. Usa T. Matsumoto T. Enomoto H. Ohtsuru A. Namba H. Iwasaki K. Yamashita S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This difference among studies may reflect the well-known sensitivity of TGF-β to details of experimental conditions (19Rosier R.N. O’Keefe R.J. Crabb I.D. Puzas J.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 20: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 32Carrington J.L. Reddi A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33van der Kraan P.M. Vitters E.L. van den Berg W.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but may also reflect the relationships among these growth factors. The seemingly discrepant results are consistent with the observation that TGF-β1 stimulates FGF-2 and FGF-2 inhibits IGF-I. Taken together, the data indicate that the regulation of IGF-I by TGF-β1 and FGF-2 is complex. IGF-I has been reported to increase its own gene expression (34Nixon A.J. Saxer R.A. Brower-Toland B.D. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Froger-Gaillard B. Hossenlopp P. Adolphe M. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2365-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the current studies, IGF-I alone had no consistent effect on IGF-I gene expression, but augmented IGF-I gene expression in the presence of TGF-β1. Indeed the synergistic interaction of IGF-I with TGF-β1 generated the highest IGF-I transcript levels observed in these studies. IGF-I, like TGF-β1, rescued IGF-I gene expression from FGF-2 inhibition. Just as the rescue by TGF-β1 required the presence of IGF-I, the rescue by IGF-I required the presence of TGF-β1. This suggests the presence of a positive interaction between IGF-I and TGF-β1 that negatively modulates the pathway by which FGF-2 regulates IGF-I gene expression. Consistent with prior studies (30Shida J.I. Jingushi S. Izumi T. Ikenoue T. Iwamoto Y. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), FGF-2 increased its own expression. Indeed, it generated the most rapid self-regulatory action observed in these studies, increasing its own transcript level 2.7-fold by 12 h. The largest magnitude stimulation by a single growth factor observed in these studies was the nearly 12-fold increase in FGF-2 transcripts generated by TGF-β1. Further, TGF-β1 acted in concert with FGF-2 to synergistically increase FGF-2 expression at early time points and by accelerating the onset of this increase. The peak effect of TGF-β1 alone occurred at 4 days, while that of TGF-β1 and FGF-2 occurred at 12 h. In contrast, after 1 day, FGF-2 reduced TGF-β1 stimulation of FGF-2 expression. Although IGF-I alone did not substantially alter FGF-2 expression or the effect of FGF-2 on FGF-2 expression at any time point, it markedly depressed the stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 after 1 day. Taken together, these data suggest that the signaling networks employed by these three factors interact in a complex fashion to regulate FGF-2 expression and do so by modulating both the magnitude and time course of expression. TGF-β1 increased its own transcripts by nearly 4-fold. This was the most pronounced self regulation observed in these studies. Consistent with prior data (30Shida J.I. Jingushi S. Izumi T. Ikenoue T. Iwamoto Y. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), FGF-2 also increased TGF-β1 transcript levels. Together, their effect was initially additive and then synergistic (Fig. 3). IGF-I reduced the stimulatory effect of FGF-2, TGF-β1, and [FGF-2 + TGF-β1], but only after 1 day. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF-2 and TGF-β1 employ distinct pathways in regulating TGF-β1 expression. The results further suggest that these pathways share elements that augment TGF-β1 expression and are not shared by IGF-I. The data suggest that differences in the actions and the interactions of these growth factors are due, in part, to differing time courses. The regulation of IGF-I expression is a case in point. Acting individually, FGF-2 inhibition of IGF-I expression began between 6 h and 12 h. TGF-β1 stimulation of IGF-I expression began between 12 h and 1 day. Consistent with this, FGF-2, TGF-β1, and IGF-I together were initially inhibitory and subsequently stimulatory. The finding that 5 days were required for TGF-β1 and IGF-I to fully rescue the cells from the inhibitory effect of FGF-2 indicates that these factors modulate each others effects over a relative protracted time period. The different time courses, as well as the different actions observed for FGF-2 and TGF-β1 suggest that IGF-I gene expression involves a variety of competing regulatory elements. FGF-2 and TGF-β1 additively increased TGF-β1 gene expression from 2 h through 1 day and synergistically after 1 day (Fig. 3). This contrasts with their regulation of FGF-2 gene expression. Together, FGF-2 and TGF-β1 synergistically stimulated FGF-2 expression from 2 h through 1 day. After 1 day, FGF-2 inhibited the stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on FGF-2 expression (Fig. 1). Thus, for both target genes, the interaction between FGF-2 and TGF-β1 is similar during the early time course, but becomes opposite later in the time course. As for IGF-I expression, the long duration of the observed growth factor actions suggests that a single administration of growth factor, or growth factors, may generate effects that persist beyond the time frame of the initial dose. The observation that TGF-β1, with or without FGF-2, augments the expression of both FGF-2 and TGF-β1 suggests the presence of a feed-forward loop that may help sustain their expression over time. Because TGF-β1 produced by the cells required HCl treatment for detection, there may exist additional positive and negative regulatory components such as TGF-β1 activators or TGF-β1 binding proteins that modulate TGF-β1 function. Further studies will be required to elucidate the role of such modulators in articular cartilage and to determine whether a single dose of TGF-β is sufficient to sustain a feed-forward loop. The effect of these growth factors on growth factor protein production generally corresponded closely with their effects on gene expression. As an apparent exception, IGF-I reduced the stimulation by FGF-2 of TGF-β1 transcripts in gene expression studies, and increased the stimulation by FGF-2 of TGF-β1 in growth factor production studies. To assess this inconsistency, we determined the effect of [IGF-I + FGF-2] on total cell protein and normalized TGF-β1 protein to total cell protein. We found that, consistent with the gene expression data, IGF-I reduced the stimulatory effect of FGF-2 on TGF-β1 protein/cell protein (Fig. 5, C and D). These data suggest that in the presence of FGF-2, IGF-I augments cellular protein synthesis to a greater degree than it augments TGF-β1 protein synthesis. To determine whether normalization to total cell protein similarly influences the interpretation of other growth factor interactions, we determined the effect of [IGF-I + TGF-β1] on total protein production and normalized FGF-2 protein to total cell protein. No change in the inhibitory effect of IGF-I, or the relation between gene expression and protein production was observed (Fig. 4, C and D). The time course of TGF-β1 action on FGF-2 protein production (Fig. 4B) and of FGF-2 action on TGF-β1 protein production (Fig. 5B), were similar to their gene expression time courses (Figs. 1A and 3A), but the protein curves showed a small right shift compared with the transcript curves. The decrease in FGF-2 or TGF-β1 transcripts at 5 days was not seen for FGF-2 or TGF-β1 protein. This difference may reflect the right shift in protein production, or a potentially longer half-life of the protein than the mRNA. Further studies will be required to separate the respective roles of transcriptional, translational and post-translational mechanisms in the regulation of these growth factors. Because many chondrocyte functions are involved in articular cartilage homeostasis and repair, the optimization of growth factor therapy for cartilage disorders will likely necessitate the use of more than one growth factor. The present data demonstrate that potentially therapeutic growth factors regulate each other, in some instances to a substantial degree. This means that delivery of one growth factor will likely generate not only the effects of that factor, but of other growth factors as well. Furthermore, the delivery of more than one factor may be expected to result in modulated effects that reflect growth factor interactions with each other. These effects may be in addition to previously identified interactions among effector signaling pathways activated by these growth factors (36Loeser R.F. Pacione C.A. Chubinskaya S.

Cell Physiol. 1994; 158: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). IGF-I acts on chondrocytes through a heterodimeric tyrosine kinase receptor that employs phosphoinositol-3 (PI3) kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades to generate its cellular actions (reviewed in Ref. 40Danielpour D. Song K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). FGF-2 employs a different family of tyrosine kinase receptors, but also uses MAP kinase and PI3 kinase downstream pathways (reviewed in Ref. 41Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 activates serine/threonine kinase receptors and post-receptor pathways that are distinct from those of FGF-2 and IGF-I in using Smad protein-mediated signaling pathways. However, all three growth factor pathways interact at several levels (reviewed in Refs. 40Danielpour D. Song K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The many shared elements within these growth factor signaling pathways may serve as the basis for involvement of these growth factors in a signaling network. The current data do not identify the sites of interaction among these signal transduction mechanisms. They do however indicate that these mechanisms provide a rich field for further study. Finally, the time course data suggest that growth factor regulation of other growth factors may be expected to modulate the actions these factors in a therapeutic setting. The results of these studies may serve to guide the selection of individual growth factors and of combinations of growth factors for application to articular cartilage repair. In this capacity, the results indicate that regimens for growth factor-based therapeutics will include a variety of options. Taken together, the present data suggest that the therapeutic application of growth factors for articular cartilage are perhaps more complex than previously appreciated. Further studies will be required to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which these growth factors regulate each other."
https://openalex.org/W2021258923,"Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin have the ability to suppress translation termination at premature stop mutations, leading to a partial restoration of protein expression and function. This observation led to studies showing that this approach may provide a viable treatment for patients with genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis that are caused by premature stop mutations. Although aminoglycoside treatment is sometimes associated with harmful side effects, several studies have shown that the co-administration of polyanions such as poly-L-aspartic acid (PAA) can both reduce toxicity and increase the intracellular aminoglycoside concentration. In the current study we examined how the co-administration of gentamicin with PAA influenced the readthrough of premature stop codons in cultured cells and a cystic fibrosis mouse model. Using a dual luciferase readthrough reporter system in cultured cells, we found that the co-administration of gentamicin with PAA increased readthrough 20-40% relative to cells treated with the same concentration of gentamicin alone. Using a Cftr-/- hCFTR-G542X mouse model, we found that PAA also increased the in vivo nonsense suppression induced by gentamicin. Following the withdrawal of gentamicin, PAA significantly prolonged the time interval during which readthrough could be detected, as shown by short circuit current measurements and immunofluorescence. Because the use of gentamicin to suppress disease-causing nonsense mutations will require their long term administration, the ability of PAA to reduce toxicity and increase both the level and duration of readthrough has important implications for this promising therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1975924985,"Neuronal differentiation is a tightly regulated process characterized by temporal and spatial alterations in gene expression. A number of studies indicate a significant role for histone acetylation in the regulation of genes involved in development. Histone acetylation is regulated by histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases. Recent findings suggest that these catalytic activities, in turn, are modulated by yet another set of regulators. Of considerable interest in this context is the possible role of the INHAT (inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase) complex, comprised of a group of acidic proteins that suppress histone acetylation by a novel ""histone-masking"" mechanism. In this study, we specifically examined the role of the leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein (LANP), a defining member of the INHAT complex whose expression is tightly regulated in neuronal development. We report that depleting LANP in neuronal cell lines promotes neurite outgrowth by inducing changes in gene expression. In addition, we show that LANP directly regulates expression of the neurofilament light chain, an important neuron-specific cytoskeletal gene, by binding to the promoter of this gene and modulating histone acetylation levels. Finally, we corroborated our findings in vivo by demonstrating increased neurite outgrowth in primary neurons obtained from LANP null mice, which is also accompanied by increased histone acetylation at the NF-L promoter. Taken together, these results implicate INHATs as a distinct class of developmental regulators involved in the epigenetic modulation of neuronal differentiation."

We have investigated the in vivo oligomerization of full-length rat CPT1A (rCPT1A) along with those of the N-terminal truncation/deletion mutants Δ(1–82), Δ(1–18), and Δ(19–30) expressed in yeast mitochondria. The data indicate that in liver mitochondria in vivo CPT1A exists as a hexamer but that during preparation and storage of mitochondria the order of oligomerization is rapidly reduced to the trimer, such that a mixture of hexamer and trimer is observed in isolated mitochondria in vitro. Mutants bearing deletions of different segments of the N terminus (including the more N-terminal of the two transmembrane domains) have the same pattern of oligomerization when expressed in yeast mitochondria. The self-association of the individual rCPT1A transmembrane (TM) domains (TM1, TM2) was also studied using the TOXCAT assay (which measures TM self-association in the Escherichia coli inner membrane). There was minimal self-association of the sequence corresponding to TM1 but significant self-association of TM2 in TOXCAT. Chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation of a TM2-derived synthetic peptide showed oligomerization with a similar trimer/hexamer equilibrium to that observed for native rCPT1A in isolated mitochondria. Therefore, there was a correlation between the oligomerization behavior of TM2 peptide and that of the full-length protein.

Quant P.A. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Changes in mitochondrial function, particularly their ability to oxidize fatty acids, accompany the development of obesity and pre-diabetes (2Reznick R.M. Shulman G.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 574: 33-39Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The activity of CPT1 also determines the availability of one of its substrates, long-chain acyl-CoA, in the cytosol such that when the rate of fatty acid oxidation is low, there is increased availability of acyl-CoA esters which are highly active intermediates involved in complex lipid synthesis (3Turner N.

J. 1999; 343: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of CPT1 activity is important not only in determining the rate of fatty acid oxidation but in the maintenance of a multiplicity of cell functions (7Zammit V.A. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CPT1A is one of three isoforms of CPT1 that are products of distinct genes that share considerable sequence similarity (∼65%) (8McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). It is a polytopic membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane (9Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) having two transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2) that link the large C-terminal (catalytic, 602-residue) and N-terminal (regulatory, 47-residue) segments of the molecule (9Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions are exposed on the cytosolic face of the membrane; the functional consequences of this topology have been described previously (11Zammit V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In CPT1A, interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein are central to the regulation of the activity of the enzyme and particularly the modulation of its sensitivity to the physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA (11Zammit V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The close interaction between the N- and C-terminal segments has been demonstrated via intramolecular cross-linking studies (12Faye A. Borthwick K. Esnous C. Price N.T. Gobin S. Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and supported by recent in silico molecular modeling of human CPT1A (13Lopez-Vinas E. Bentebibel A. Gurunathan C. Morillas M. de Arriaga D. Serra D. Asins G. Hegardt F.G. Gomez-Puertas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18212-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The TM domains play an important role in mediating and modulating N-C interactions (12Faye A. Borthwick K. Esnous C. Price N.T. Gobin S. Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as does the loop linking the two TMs (14Kolodziej M.P. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Zammit V.A. Corstorphine C.G. Kolodziej M.P. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that rat CPT1A exists as an oligomer and that the N-terminal region of the protein containing TM1 and TM2 (residues 1–147 in the rat enzyme, rCPT1A) is involved in driving the oligomerization of CPT1A (16Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, it was shown that full-length rCPT1A (whether in rat liver mitochondria or when expressed heterologously in the yeast Pichia pastoris) forms oligomeric complexes when analyzed using gel filtration chromatography or Blue Native (BN)-PAGE. The fundamental oligomeric unit was suggested to be the trimer, which associates into a dimer of trimers to yield hexamers (16Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The protein-protein interactions that stabilize these complexes were narrowed down to a 51-amino acid stretch of CPT1A (residues 97–147) that includes TM2 and a non-cleavable matrix-targeting signal sequence. When expressed as a fusion protein with dihydrofolate reductase, this region induced the formation of hexamers. However, any complementary role of the oligomerization behavior of rat CPT1A TM1 could not be investigated (16Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations point toward an important role for the TM domains in the oligomeric assembly of rCPT1A. This role can be conceptualized using the “two-stage model” of membrane protein folding (17Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) which describes the side-by-side interactions of TM α-helices in the plane of the bilayer as strong determinants of correct folding and assembly of membrane proteins. In the present study we have investigated the role of the TMs in the oligomerization of full-length rCPT1A. Self-association of each individual TM domain was studied directly in natural membranes (Escherichia coli) using the TOXCAT assay (18Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The resulting data indicate that whereas TM2 has a strong propensity for homo-oligomerization, TM1 does not. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the TM2 sequence of rat CPT1A was used to obtain quantitative biophysical evidence of TM2-peptide oligomerization, including the stoichiometry of assembly in detergent micelles. The results have enabled us to construct molecular models that highlight potential points of contact between TM2 helices and suggest that oligomer formation is favored by the relative positioning of tightly packing GXXXG and GXXXA motifs within the predicted TM2 helix. Preparation of Rat Liver Mitochondria-Mitochondria were prepared from livers of fed male Wistar rats. The liver was rapidly excised from the rat and placed in 20 ml of ice-cold homogenization medium containing 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The liver was minced using scissors and washed 2–3 times in ice-cold medium. The minced liver was homogenized using a Porter-Elvenheim Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove debris. The supernatant was then decanted and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant crude mitochondrial fraction was collected and resuspended in a medium containing 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and gently resuspended. After this, the mitochondria were sedimented by centrifuging at 9000 × g for 10 min to give a mitochondrial fraction. For rapid preparation of the mitochondria, the second centrifugation step was omitted. Preparation of P. pastoris Mitochondria-Yeast cultures were grown for 24 h at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. All initial steps were carried out at room temperature. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min, and the resultant pellet was weighed. The appropriate amounts ofTris-SO42- (2 ml g-1 yeast) and dithiothreitol (3.084 mg g-1 yeast) were added. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10–15 min with shaking at 150 rpm. The cells were then sedimented by centrifugation as before and washed in 1.2 m sorbitol/20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). This pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm potassium phosphate, and zymolase was added (3.4 mg g-1). The cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking (150 rpm) for 20 min. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. An equal volume of mannitol buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 1 mm KCl, 10 mm MES, and 0.5 mm EDTA) was added containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Spheroplasts were collected by sedimentation and washed in the mannitol-containing buffered medium. The pellet was then resuspended in 20 ml of the same medium and homogenized using a Porter-Elvenheim Teflon glass homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove debris. The supernatant was then decanted and further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. The pellet was washed and resuspended in a medium containing 0.6 m sorbitol and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Blue Native PAGE of CPT1A-Samples were prepared and subjected to Blue Native PAGE using the Novex Bis-Tris gel system (Invitrogen). Briefly 100 μg of mitochondrial fraction were collected by centrifugation for 12 min at 12,000 × g in a cooled centrifuge at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl of Native sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% digitonin. After solubilization for 15 min on ice, the extracts were centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 × g, and the supernatants were recovered and supplemented with 0.5 μl of G-250 additive (Invitrogen) for each 10 μl of extract before electrophoresis on 4–16% gradient Novex Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). The calibration standard kit used was comprised of eight proteins with a molecular mass covering the range between 20 and 1200 kDa. Western Blot Analysis-Separated proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using Tris-glycine transfer buffer. After transfer, the membrane was washed for 15 min in 8% acetic acid and allowed to air-dry. The membrane was then washed in methanol, and proteins were detected as described previously using the ECL detection system (Pierce). The antibodies used were antipeptide antibodies raised against the Arg428-Lys441 sequence within the C-segment of rat CPT1A (19Kolodziej M.P. Crilly P.J. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TOXCAT Assay and Construction of Chimera-The self-association of rCPT1A transmembrane domains in a natural membrane was studied using the TOXCAT assay, the details of which have been described previously (18Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Briefly, TOXCAT employs a chimeric protein in which the α-helical TM domain of interest is inserted between the N-terminal DNA binding domain of ToxR, a dimerization-dependent transcriptional activator, and maltose-binding protein, a monomeric periplasmic anchor protein. The fusion protein is constitutively expressed in E. coli together with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under the control of a ToxR-responsive ctx promoter. Oligomerization of the TM domains within the bacterial inner membrane results in oligomerization of the ToxR domain, transcriptional activation of the ctx promoter, and CAT expression. The amount of CAT expressed in this system is proportional to the strength of oligomerization of the TM domains. The expression vectors (pccKAN, pccGpA-wt, and pccGpA-G83I) and E. coli strain NT326 were kindly provided by Prof. Donald M. Engelman. TOXCAT chimera were constructed according to a reported protocol (18Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and expressed in E. coli. Before performing the assay, membrane insertion of all constructs was confirmed using sodium hydroxide washes (20Chen H. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and correct orientation of the TOXCAT constructs in the membrane was confirmed through protease sensitivity in a spheroplast assay (18Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Similar expression levels for all constructs were confirmed via Western analysis against the maltose-binding protein domain before performing CAT assays. The CAT assays were performed using the FAST CAT kit (Molecular Probes and Invitrogen). Peptide Synthesis and Purification-A peptide corresponding to the second TM domain (TM2) of CPT1A was synthesized at the Keck Facility, Yale University using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The sequence of the TM2 peptide was COCH3-KKNIVSGVLFGTGLWVAVIMT-MRK-CONH2, containing residues Lys102-Arg123 as well as non-native lysine residues (to aid solubility) and end-caps on the C and N termini (Mr = 2689 Da). The peptide was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a linear acetonitrile gradient from 30 to 100% containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a Phenomenex C4 semipreparative column. The purity of pooled peptide fractions was confirmed by electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (ESI-TOF-MS microTOF, Bruker) before subsequent lyophilization. Peptides were stored as dry powders until use. Circular Dichroism (CD)-CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco UK, Great Dunmow, UK) and 1.0-mm path-length quartz cuvettes (Starna, Optiglass Ltd, Hainault, UK). All spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm (data below 200 nm are not shown due to high noise of light scattering) using a 2.0-nm spectral bandwidth, 0.2-nm step resolution, 100-nm min-1 scanning speed, and 1-s response time. The TM2 peptide was prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 10 mm SDS or 46 mm dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster AL) and 100 mm NaCl to a final peptide concentration of 40 μm. CD spectra were collected at room temperature. Peptide Cross-linking in Detergents-Cross-linking reactions were carried out for 20 μm solutions of the TM2 peptide dissolved in DPC micelles at peptide:micelle ratios ranging from 1 to 20 (corresponding to DPC concentrations ranging from 2.7 to 24 mm). All samples were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 150 mm NaCl (pH 8). Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3, Pierce) was used to cross-link the peptide in solution via primary amine groups according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cross-linking reaction was terminated after 30 min by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8). Uncross-linked and SDS cross-linked samples were prepared as controls. All samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and peptides were visualized on gels by staining either with Coomassie Blue or with silver nitrate. Analytical Ultracentrifugation-Sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out on a Beckman XL-1/A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton CA) housed in the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. TM2 peptide samples were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 15 mm DPC (Avanti Polar Lipids), 100 mm NaCl, and 52.5% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover MA) to match the buoyant density of the detergent. When the solvent matches the buoyant density of the detergent micelles, the only contribution to the buoyant molecular weight is from the peptide, as described (21Kochendoerfer G.G. Salom D. Lear J.D. Wilk-Orescan R. Kent S.B. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11905-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Data were collected using absorbance optics set to 280 nm at two peptide concentrations (142 and 62 μm) using a double-sector centerpiece at a speed of 40,000 rpm and a temperature of 25 °C. 400 scans were recorded for each sample, with 50 s between each scan. The moving boundary was monitored by repetitive radial scanning at a constant step size of 0.003 cm at 280 nm using a UV absorption optical system. Fitting of the resulting profiles was achieved using SEDFIT (22Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar) to generate a continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution, which was subsequently converted to a molecular mass distribution using a peptide monomeric molecular mass of 2689 Da, a buffer density of 1.05971 g ml-1, a buffer viscosity of 1.0267 centipoise, and a partial specific volume of 0.7792 ml g-1 (calculated using SEDNTERP). Computational Searches Using CHI-Structural calculations were performed using the CNS searching of helix interactions (CHI) package, the details of which have been described previously (23Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 24Adams P.D. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar), on an 8-node dual 2.66-GHz Xenon processor Linux cluster (Streamline Computing, Warwick). CHI was used to create models of rCPT1A TM2 homotrimers and homohexamers. Using CHI, either three (for trimer) or six (for hexamer) canonical α-helices containing residues Lys102-Arg123 of TM2 were built. The starting geometries incorporated both right-handed (-25°) and left-handed (25°) crossing angles and an axis-to-axis distance between the helices of 10.4 Å. In a search of approximately symmetrical interactions, the helices were simultaneously rotated about their central axis in 45° increments from 0° to 360°. After each rotation, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using simulated annealing of atomic coordinates. Four different molecular dynamics simulations were performed for each starting geometry, and energy minimization of structures was carried out both before and after molecular dynamics simulations. Groups of structures with a backbone root-mean-square deviation of ≤1 Å were placed in clusters of 10 or more members followed by a calculation of an average structure for each cluster and energy minimization. The oligomeric states of native rCPT1A in both intact rat liver mitochondria or expressed in mitochondria of the yeast P. pastoris were studied in addition to those of several yeast-expressed N-terminal truncation/deletion mutants (Δ1–82, Δ1–18, Δ19–30) to investigate which regions of the protein contribute to oligomer formation. A schematic of the various regions of rCPT1A is shown in Fig. 1a. The digitonin-solubilized mitochondrial extracts were analyzed using BN-PAGE followed by Western blotting and immunodetection with antipeptide antibody raised against the C-terminal segment of the protein (19Kolodziej M.P. Crilly P.J. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). In both rat liver and yeast extracts, Western blotting revealed bands at ∼264 and 528 kDa corresponding to rCPT1A trimers and hexamers, respectively. In preliminary experiments, extracts prepared in digitonin or 1% Triton-X-100 gave the same results (data not shown). Subsequent experiments were performed using only digitonin extraction. The results are at variance with previously published BN-PAGE analyses of CPT1A, where only hexamers were observed (16Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In that same study, however, the investigators observed only trimers when detergent extracts were analyzed by gel filtration. In the present studies all three deletion/truncation mutants migrated as a mixture of trimers and hexamers, with resolved bands observed at the appropriate molecular weights for the mutants studied (Fig. 1b). Our observation of both trimers and hexamers in samples analyzed by the same technique (BN-PAGE) indicates that the two oligomeric forms co-exist, at least in vitro. Furthermore, the data show that truncation (Δ1–18) and deletion (Δ19–30) mutants that differ widely in their kinetic characteristics from those of the native protein (26Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (particularly their malonyl-CoA sensitivity) have the same oligomerization pattern (mixture of hexamers and trimers) as that of the native rCPT1A. Moreover, we have confirmed the previous finding that deletion of the N-terminal sequence including TM1 has no effect on oligomerization of the protein (although in the present data both trimers and hexamers were observed). This agrees with the suggestion that TM2 may provide the driving force for rCPT1A oligomeric assembly (16Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As the BN-PAGE results given in Fig. 1b differ from previous results in that both trimers and hexamers of rCPT1A were present in digitonin extracts of mitochondria isolated from rat liver and P. pastoris, we addressed the question of whether the trimer/hexamer ratio was altered during preparation of the mitochondria, as this would be indicative of whether the two oligomeric forms exist in equilibrium or whether one is preferentially present in vivo. Therefore, crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared as rapidly as possible from rat liver followed by storage at either 0 or 37 °C before extraction with digitonin, BN-PAGE analyses of the proteins, and Western blotting. The data shown in Fig. 1c indicate that when mitochondria were kept at 0 °C for less than 30 min, both trimers and hexamers were observed. However, at longer incubation times (t ≥ 30 min; T = 0 °C) the proportion of CPT1A present as the hexamer was rapidly diminished, whereas that of the trimer was increased. When mitochondria were stored at 37 °C, the hexamer was not observed at all (even after the shortest incubation times), and only the trimer was detected. These data suggest that rCPT1A may exist mainly as hexamers in the rat liver mitochondrial outer membrane in vivo and that changes in the mitochondrial membrane that occur during isolation and storage result in rapid destabilization of the higher order oligomeric state. Although the present data and those published previously (16Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that TM2 plays a key role in oligomer formation of rCPT1A, no direct measurements of self-association for either TM of rCPT1A have been reported. To address this, we have examined the homo-oligomerization of rCPT1A TM1 and TM2 using the TOXCAT assay, a ToxR-based transcriptional assay linked to CAT expression. TOXCAT is a method used to quantify the ability of individual TM domains to self-associate in a natural (E. coli) membrane bilayer and in which the degree of association can be measured in terms of the CAT activity generated as a result of the homo-oligomerization of TM domains (18Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequences corresponding to the respective TM domains of rCPT1A that were investigated using TOXCAT are shown in Fig. 2a. The selection of these sequences was based on an analysis of the full-length sequence of rCPT1A using the bioinformatics program TMHMM (27Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar, 28Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar) to predict the location of TM domains. TOXCAT data were also obtained for a positive control (the TM domain of glycophorin A (GpA), which is known to dimerize strongly (29Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.-J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and a negative control, GpA-G83I, a dimerization-impaired mutant. The data are shown in Fig. 2b. Comparison of the rCPT1A TM1 signal in the TOX-CAT assay to that of the controls indicated that TM1 has very little propensity to self-associate. Indeed, TM1 yielded homo-oligomerization-dependent CAT activities that were lower than those produced by the negative control (GpA-G83I). Conversely, rCPT1A TM2 showed a higher propensity to form homo-oligomers, yielding CAT activities approximately half those observed for the TM domain of GpA. It is important to note that the TM-spanning regions for TM1- and TM2-containing TOXCAT constructs are very different in length; the TM1 insert contained 24 amino acids, whereas the TM2 insert contained 16 amino acids. It has been shown previously that in a similar assay the length of t"

Flavoproteins are involved in a large variety of biological processes (DNA repair, apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, etc.) and require the riboflavin-derived redox cofactors FMN or FAD for their function. In vivo, riboflavin (RF) 3The abbreviations used are: RF, riboflavin; FADS, FAD synthetase; LF, lumiflavin; RFK, riboflavin kinase; AMPPNP, 5′-adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; Tm, Thermotoga maritima; Ca, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes; WT, wild type. is converted into FMN first and then into FAD via the sequential action of an ATP:riboflavin kinase (RFK) (EC 2.7.1.26) and an ATP:FMN adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.2) (see Fig. 1A). Eukaryotes generally use two different enzymes for FMN and FAD production (1Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J.

FEBS J. 2009; 276: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas most prokaryotes depend on a single bifunctional enzyme, the FAD synthetase (FADS) (8Manstein D.J. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16169-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mack M. van Loon A.P. Hohmann H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 950-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two catalytic cycles of FADS involve the binding of two ATP, one RF, and one FMN molecules as substrates and the production of one ADP, one PPi, one FMN, and one FAD. The proposed pathway for the phosphorylation reaction would be for RF to bind before ATP, whereas ADP releases prior FMN (10Efimov I. Kuusk V. Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the adenylylation process, FMN is proposed to bind after ATP and the PPi to be released preceding FAD (10Efimov I. Kuusk V. Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The two enzymatic activities differ in their specificity for divalent cations, optimal pH, and temperature (8Manstein D.J. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16169-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hagihara T. Fujio T. Aisaka K. Appl. Microbiol.

Biochem. 1995; 59: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The presence of Mg2+ improves the turnover of both processes but, although low concentrations (<1 mm) enhance the kinase activity, much larger concentrations (∼10 mm) are required for maximal FAD production (8Manstein D.J. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16169-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicated the presence of two independent ATP-binding sites, one at the RF phosphorylation site and one at the FMN-adenylylation site, but a single pocket was proposed to allocate the isoalloxazine-ribityl moieties of both substrates, RF and FMN, in the two reactions (10Efimov I. Kuusk V. Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The only structure reported for an FADS is that of Thermotoga maritima (TmFADS), both free and in complex with several substrates (13Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2003; 52: 633-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2005; 58: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of these structures shows simultaneous binding of AMP in the N-terminal domain and ADP and FMN in the C-terminal domain. Thus, the protein folds in two almost independent domains, each one hosting one ATP-binding site, whereas only a flavin-binding site, located in the C-terminal domain, was detected (14Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2005; 58: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in the C-terminal domain the ribityl and phosphate of the flavin are not placed in the putative active site. This is probably due to the disorder in the protein regions hosting the flavin. The C-terminal domain shows structural homology with Homo sapiens and Schizosaccharomyces pombe RFKs (14Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2005; 58: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Frago S. Martínez-Júlvez M. Serrano A. Medina M.

BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region presents remote similarities with nucleotydyltransferases (18Krupa A. Sandhya K. Srinivasan N. Jonnalagadda S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but it does not appear to be self-sufficient to transform FMN into FAD (15Frago S. Martínez-Júlvez M. Serrano A. Medina M. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The TmFADS structure shows a large distance between the reported flavin-binding site and the adenylylation site (14Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2005; 58: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the asymmetric unit is a dimer, it does not appear functional. These observations, together with the fact that the FMN produced in the phosphorylation process has to be released before rebinding as substrate for the second reaction (10Efimov I. Kuusk V. Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), make it logical to propose the presence of a second flavin-binding site, located in the N-terminal domain. The structural model of FADS from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes (CaFADS) shows the main structural arrangements present in TmFADS (13Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2003; 52: 633-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2005; 58: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and it also shows the disposition of some loops and a 310-helix at the C-terminal domain that are missed in the TmFADS structure. Additionally, the C-terminal domain of CaFADS showed an insertion around residue 230 with regard to TmFADS. This model also suggests the presence of a novel putative second flavin-binding site in the N-terminal domain (15Frago S. Martínez-Júlvez M. Serrano A. Medina M. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B). This site would be located in the proximity of the adenine nucleotide-binding site and might bind FMN for adenylylation. The present study provides a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the binding of adenine nucleotide and flavin ligands to CaFADS and to its individually cloned C terminus domain. It confirms the presence of two flavin-binding sites in CaFADS and allows assigning affinities to the different flavin and adenine nucleotide-binding sites. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of CaFADS and Its C-terminal Domain-WT CaFADS was cloned, overexpressed, and purified as previously described (15Frago S. Martínez-Júlvez M. Serrano A. Medina M. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The separately cloned C-terminal domain (Δ(1–182)FADS) was purified using a similar protocol, replacing the DEAE-cellulose chromatography with a Superose 12 gel filtration (GE Healthcare). Spectral Analysis-UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Cary-100 spectrophotometer. To determine the extinction coefficient (∈) of CaFADS in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the protein was recorded in each buffer. The samples were subsequently diluted with 7.5 m guanidinium hydrochloride in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, to 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. The absorbance spectra were again recorded. Protein concentration was calculated using the theoretical ∈280 nm for the denatured protein (19Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Protein Identification and Analysis Tools on the ExPASy Server. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005Crossref Google Scholar). The ∈280 nm in each buffer was obtained from the initial spectra. For Δ(1–182)FADS, the theoretical ∈280 nm of 14 mm–1 cm–1 was used (19Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Protein Identification and Analysis Tools on the ExPASy Server. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005Crossref Google Scholar). Difference spectroscopy measurements were carried out in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The reference cuvette, containing buffer, and the sample cuvette, containing 5–6 μm FADS (3 μm for titration with RF), were stepwise titrated with aliquots of 1–10 μl of the corresponding flavin solutions (∼180 μm RF, 750–1500 μm FMN, and 450–600 μm FAD). For the measurements in the presence of AMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, both cuvettes contained 1 mm AMPPNP and 10 mm MgCl2. Dissociation constants and difference extinction coefficients were obtained by nonlinear regression fit of the experimental data to the theoretical equation for a 1:N stoichiometric complex (20Sancho J. Gomez-Moreno C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar),ΔAbs=Δ∈l2N(N[FADS]+[L]+Kd)-(N[FADS]+[L]+Kd)2-4N[FADS][L]Eq. 1 where Δ∈ is the change in the flavin extinction coefficient upon ligand binding to FADS, l is the cuvette path length, [FADS] and [L] are the total concentrations of FADS and flavin, respectively, Kd is the dissociation constant, and N is the number of flavin-binding sites in FADS. The errors estimated for Kd and Δ∈ were ±15%. CD spectra were recorded in a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) at 5 °C in the far-UV (7 μm FADS in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1-cm cuvette) and in the near-UV (20 μm FADS in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.4-cm cuvette). Near-UV CD spectra were also recorded at 20 °C with saturating concentrations of ATP, ADP, and/or FMN, at both 0 and 10 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 spectrometer in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 25 °C, exciting the protein aromatic residues at 280 nm. Differential Scanning Calorimetry-The heat capacity of FADS (ΔCP) was measured as a function of temperature at pH 7.0 with a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal LLC). Thermal denaturation scans were performed with 8 and 24 μm degassed FADS solutions in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at a scanning rate of 1 °C/min from 10 to 100 °C. Reversibility of the unfolding process was checked by sample reheating after cooling inside the calorimetric cell. The unfolding of FADS was not reversible, and therefore only a van’t Hoff model-independent analysis was performed (21Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Freire E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 191-218PubMed Google Scholar). High Sensitivity Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)-Measurements were carried out using a high precision VP-ITC system (MicroCal LLC). Typically, a ∼300 μm FAD or FMN solution or a 300–500 μm ADP, ATP, or AMPPNP solution was used to titrate ∼10–20 μm FADS. Because of the low solubility of Lumiflavin (LF, a RF analogue lacking the ribityl chain) and RF, FADS solutions of ∼5 and ∼10 μm were titrated with LF and RF ∼90 and ∼175 μm, respectively. Both the ligand and FADS were dissolved in the same buffer (20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, with variable MgCl2 concentrations: 0, 0.8, or 10 mm) and degassed. This buffer was selected because of its low ionization enthalpy, which prevents any buffer influence on the observed enthalpy of binding caused by possible de/protonation events. Titrations of FADS·nucleotide or FADS·FAD complexes were carried out by stepwise injections of the ligand into a mixture of FADS and a saturating concentration of the adenine nucleotide (400–500 μm) and/or FAD (80–100 μm). Each titration was initiated by a 4-μl injection followed by 25–28 stepwise injections of 10 μl. The heat evolved after each ligand injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat caused by the binding reaction was obtained as the difference between the heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution, the latter estimated as a constant heat throughout the experiment and included as an adjustable parameter in the analysis. The association constant (Ka), the enthalpy change (ΔH), and the stoichiometry (N) were obtained through nonlinear regression of the experimental data to a model for one or two independent binding sites implemented in Origin 7.0. The dissociation constant (Kd), the free energy change (ΔG), and the entropy change (ΔS) were obtained from basic thermodynamic relationships. Usually, when N = 2 there was not enough information in the titrations for using a model with two different binding sites and averaged binding parameters are given. The estimated error was ±15% in Kd and ± 0.3 kcal/mol in ΔH and –TΔS. To analyze a possible interaction between FADS and Mg2+, 20 μm FADS was titrated with a 300 μm MgCl2 solution. An additional titration of FADS in the presence of 40 μm EDTA with 900 μm MgCl2 was carried out to exclude putative Mg2+-binding sites in FADS already being loaded. Additionally, a solution of 40 μm EDTA was titrated with 900 μm MgCl2 to obtain the parameters for the EDTA-Mg2+ interaction. Finally, ITC experiments involving the dilution of 440 μm FADS into 20 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.0 buffer were also performed to test the enzyme oligomerization state (23Velázquez-Campoy A. Leavitt S.A. Freire E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar, 24Burrows S.D. Doyle M.L. Murphy K.P. Franklin S.G. White J.R. Brooks I. McNulty D.E. Scott M.O. Knutson J.R. Porter D. Young P.R. Hensley P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12741-12745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Spectral Properties of CaFADS-CaFADS presented an UV-visible maximum at 279 nm. The ∈279 nm was 28.1 mm–1 cm–1 in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 25.6 mm–1 cm–1 in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The far-UV CD spectrum of CaFADS showed a negative-positive couplet (208–191 nm) typical of a secondary α-helix structure. The negative band around 222 nm, also typical of α-helix, appeared like a shoulder (Fig. 2A), probably because of an important content of β-sheet (Fig. 1B). The near-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 2A) was sensible to substrate binding. Changes were more evident in the simultaneous presence of FMN, ADP, or ATP, and Mg2+ and suggest that binding takes place by influencing the environment of aromatic residues. Excitation of CaFADS at 280 nm produced a fluorescence emission band centered at 330 nm, indicating that, in general, the Trp residues of the protein are contained in an apolar environment. Binding of Flavins to FADS Followed by Differential Spectroscopy-Titration of FADS with RF, FMN, and FAD produced the appearance of visible difference spectra (Fig. 2B), indicating changes in the dielectric environment of the isoalloxazine upon interaction with FADS. Although titration with RF or FMN produced similar difference spectra, the spectrum elicited upon interaction with FAD was different (Fig. 2B). The magnitude of the difference spectra reached saturation (Fig. 2D), allowing the determination of Kd and Δ∈. Fitting of the data to Equation 1 suggested two independent binding sites for RF with an average Kd (Kd,av) of 5.2 μm, whereas a single binding site was detected for FMN and FAD with Kd values of 13.1 and 2.3 μm, respectively. The saturating concentration of AMPPNP-Mg2+ produced a considerable increase in Δ∈ when FADS was titrated with RF and, especially, with FMN (Fig. 2C). AMPPNP-Mg2+ considerably increased the FADS affinity for RF while decreasing that for FMN (Kd of 0.6 and 90.5 μm, respectively). However, AMPPNP-Mg2+ did not affect the FAD interaction (Fig. 2). FADS Thermal Denaturation Followed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry-FADS thermal denaturation exhibited two partially overlapping transitions (Tm,ap = 41.1 °C), suggesting that the unfolding processes of the N- and C-terminal domains are not fully cooperative. By direct integration of the signal, a calorimetric ΔH of 165 kcal/mol and an unfolding ΔCP of 4.2 kcal/K·mol were obtained. A statistical analysis of globular proteins indicates that the unfolding ΔCP and the unfolding ΔH at 60 °C scale with protein size according to: ΔCP = 13.9·NR cal/(K·mol·res) and ΔH(60 °C) = 0.698·NR kcal/(mol·res), where NR is the number of residues in the protein (25Robertson A.D. Murphy K.P. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1251-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). FADS, with 338 residues, has an estimated unfolding ΔCP of 4.7 kcal/K·mol and an unfolding ΔH(60 °C) of 236 kcal/mol. They compare well with the experimental values of 4.2 kcal/K·mol and 245 kcal/mol (extrapolation at 60 °C). This suggests that the protein is folded in solution with no significant unstructured regions. A second cycle of thermal denaturation indicated that the unfolding process was not reversible, the less stable domain being responsible for the nonreversibility. The more stable domain showed a reversible thermal denaturation with a Tm of 43.8 °C. The van’t Hoff analysis provides a van’t Hoff unfolding ΔH of 84 kcal/mol. A value of 0.51 for the van’t Hoff-calorimetric ΔH ratio also indicates that the thermal transition is not fully cooperative and that at least two domains unfold independently. Finally, the lack of effect on Tm,ap upon increasing protein concentration (from 8 to 24 μm) indicated that FADS is in the monomeric state at both concentrations, in agreement with the FADS dilution experiment by ITC. ITC Analysis of the Interaction of FADS with Mg2+-Direct titration of the enzyme with MgCl2 did not produce any calorimetric change related to an interaction between FADS and Mg2+. This indicates that CaFADS does not show specific binding of free Mg2+. ITC Analysis of the Binding of Adenine Nucleotides to FADS-The interaction of WT FADS with ATP, ADP, and AMPPNP was analyzed by ITC at pH 7.0 and 25 °C at different [Mg2+] (Fig. 3 and Table 1). A single ATP-binding site with a K ATPd of 10 μm was detected for FADS in the absence of Mg2+. The presence of this cation produced the appearance of a second ATP-binding site and increased the Kd,avATP (Table 1). Similarly, FADS showed a single ADP-binding site in the absence of Mg2+, the affinity four times lower than that of ATP (Table 1) and two ADP-binding sites in the presence of Mg2+ without altering Kd,avADP. AMPPNP interacted with FADS considerably more weakly than ATP and without major [Mg2+] effects. Therefore, AMPPNP is not a suitable ATP analogue for the purpose of this study.TABLE 1Stoichiometry and interaction parameters for the FADS-nucleotide and FADS-flavin interaction determined by ITCFADS ligandNKd0 mm Mg2+0.8 mm Mg2+10 mm Mg2+0 mm Mg2+0.8 mm Mg2+10 mm Mg2+μmATP12210.041.655.3ADP12243.048.838.9AMPPNP1275.781.4FAD1112.01.80.8FMN1113.03.11.6RF2227.66.92.8LF2216.97.53.3 Open table in a new tab Direct titrations also allowed the determination of the enthalpy and entropy components of the interactions (Fig. 4). A favorable enthalpy change drove the interaction of ATP, ADP, and AMPPNP with FADS over the unfavorable entropic contribution, although the magnitude was considerably smaller for the latter. Increasing [Mg2+] resulted in an slightly less favorable enthalpic binding contribution and a less unfavorable entropic one (Fig. 4). However, especially for ADP and AMPPNP, ΔG remained remarkably insensitive to [Mg2+] through entropy/enthalpy compensation. ITC Analysis of the Binding of Flavins to FADS-The interaction of WT FADS with its RF, FMN, and FAD substrates/products, as well as with LF, was also analyzed (Fig. 5 and Table 1). A single FADS-binding site for FMN and FAD was determined, independently of [Mg2+], with Kd values in the range of 1–3 μm for both flavins. Binding of FMN and FAD was driven by a large enthalpy change but at high cost in entropy (Fig. 6). Increasing [Mg2+] hardly influenced the interaction with FMN, but the interaction with FAD resulted in being slightly less favored by the enthalpic contribution and less unfavored by the entropic one (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Thermodynamic dissection of the interaction between FADS with FAD, FMN, RF, and LF. The other conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two binding sites were detected when FADS was titrated with RF and LF, both binding only slightly more weakly than FMN or FAD (Table 1). Binding of RF and LF was also enthalpically driven with a very small opposing entropic contribution that was favorable in the presence of Mg2+ (unlike interactions with FAD and FMN) (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the considerably less polar nature of RF and LF. ITC Analysis of Flavin Binding to Preformed FADS·Nucleotide Complexes-A single FAD-binding site was unequivocally determined in the presence of saturating concentrations of ADP or AMPPNP (Table 2 and Fig. 7). AMPPNP had minor effects on the binding parameters, but the presence of ADP considerably reduced the FADS affinity for FAD at low [Mg2+] (Table 2). This reduction in the affinity is the result of considerably less favorable enthalpic and less unfavorable entropic binding contributions (Figs. 6 and 8). However, at high [Mg2+], binding affinity of FAD to FADS·ADP was similar to that to free FADS because of the less favorable enthalpic contribution being compensated with a favorable binding entropy (Figs. 6 and 8).TABLE 2Stoichiometry and interaction parameters for ligand binding to FADS in the presence of a second ligand determined by ITCTitrating ligandSaturating ligandNKd0 mm Mg2+0.8 mm Mg2+10 mm Mg2+0 mm Mg2+0.8 mm Mg2+10 mm Mg2+μmFADAMPPNP114.00.6FADADP11137.624.40.9FMNAMPPNP118.30.9FMNADP2228.51.60.25site 10.06site 21.1FMNFAD1200FMNADP, FAD21.4RFAMPPNP228.73.1RFADP1222.60.81.5RFFAD213.5LFADP22aMost likely value based on the analysis of the enthalpy and entropy contributions.14.74.95.7ADPFAD1bVery weak interaction is observed.ATPFAD116.8a Most likely value based on the analysis of the enthalpy and entropy contributions.b Very weak interaction is observed.

The other conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The preformed FADS·ADP complex was able to bind two FMN molecules. Therefore, the presence of ADP promoted the appearance of a second FMN-binding site (Tables 2 and 3). The presence of Mg2+ enhanced the FADS·ADP complex affinity for FMN (Table 2). At the highest [Mg2+] assayed, the independent Kd values for the two FMN-binding sites could be determined. Additionally, the simultaneous presence of Mg2+ and ADP had an important effect in the enthalpic and entropic binding contributions (Figs. 6 and 8). Binding of FMN to the preformed FADS·ADP complex was enthalpically driven with an opposing entropic contribution in the absence of Mg2+. However, its presence promoted the enthalpic contribution to become less favorable and transformed the unfavorable entropy into a favorable one, making the interaction stronger. Binding of FMN to the FADS·AMPPNP complex showed similar affinity values to those for the FADS·ADP complex, but a second FMN-binding site was not observed (Table 2).TABLE 3Stoichiometry and interaction parameters for the (Δ1-182)FADS-ligand interaction determined by ITCTitrating ligandSaturating ligandNKd0 mm Mg2+10 mm Mg2+0 mm Mg2+10 mm Mg2+μmATP117095.4ADP01aNo interaction is observed under these conditions.32.8FAD00aNo interaction is observed under these conditions.bVery weak interaction is observed.FMN00bVery weak interaction is observed.bVery weak interaction is observed.FMNADP10.45RF111.87.2RFADP10.9a No interaction is observed under these conditions.b Very weak interaction is observed. Open table in a new tab Binding of RF to FADS preloaded with ADP pointed out the presence of a single RF-binding site that turned into two sites in the presence of Mg2+ (Table 2). The cation also causes a slight increase in the affinity for RF. Two binding sites to FADS·AMPPNP were also detected. The favorable enthalpic and, especially, the unfavorable entropic contributions became considerably less intense upon increasing [Mg2+] (Fig. 8). ITC Analysis of Competitive Ligand Binding to Preformed FADS Complexes-A set of experiments in the presence of an excess of FAD as competitive ligand was carried out to establish the binding domain of ligands with a single binding site (Table 2). According to previous modeling studies (15Frago S. Martínez-Júlvez M. Serrano A. Medina M. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to our own data, FAD must bind at the N-terminal domain, blocking both the adenine nucleotide and the putative flavin nucleotide-binding sites of this domain. Under FAD saturation and lacking Mg2+, FMN binding was hardly detected (Table 2). Because in the presence of ADP and 10 mm MgCl2 FADS binds two FMN molecules (Table 2), FADS was simultaneously saturated with ADP and FAD at 10 mm MgCl2 and titrated with FMN. Two FMN-binding sites were also detected, but the FMN interaction was weaker than in the single ADP presence (Table 2). Two RF-binding sites were detected in the FAD·FADS complex with a Kd,avRF of 13.5 μm (Table 2). Therefore, FAD makes the interaction of FADS with one of the RF molecules slightly weaker. In the FADS·FAD complex, a single binding site for ATP or ADP was again observed (Tables 1 and 2). ATP affinity was not affected, but the presen"
https://openalex.org/W2030803506,"The dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25B is capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation, and this occurs in a manner dependent upon its catalytic activity. Here it is shown that this is accompanied by inappropriate cyclin-dependent kinase activation and premature mitotic entry, leading to both p53-dependent and independent checkpoints. Forced expression of Cdc25B inappropriately up-regulated the activity of Cdk1 and Cdk2, by reducing levels of inhibitory phosphorylation. In cells lacking p14ARF, p53 is induced, and components of the ATM and ATR pathways are activated. Cdc25B triggers cell cycle arrest in the G(1) and G(2) phases that is p53- and p21-dependent and is inhibited by caffeine. Cdc25B also causes cells with an S phase DNA content to enter mitosis prematurely in a p53-independent manner. Synchronization of cells with aphidicolin results in these cells undergoing apoptosis. Thus, inappropriate cell cycle progression and premature mitotic entry via dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases results in activation of both p53-dependent and independent responses. Because Cdc25B is known to have oncogenic activity, this provides insight into the multistep nature of cancer development and why there is p53 loss during tumorigenesis."
