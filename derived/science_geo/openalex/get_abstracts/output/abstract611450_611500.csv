The composition of the gut microbiome influences many human diseases, including liver inflammatory disorders. Ma et al. found that commensal gut bacteria can recruit the immune system to control the growth of liver tumors in mice (see the Perspective by Hartmann and Kronenberg). Clostridium species modified bile acids to signal liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to produce the chemokine CXCL16. This recruited natural killer T (NKT) immune cells to perform antitumor surveillance of the liver. Growth of both primary and metastatic cancer was reduced by NKT cell–driven killing.

Jin et al. prepared nanofibers from block polymers consisting of emissive polyfluorene cores surrounded by coronas of polyethylene glycol and polythiophene (see the Perspective by Holmes). Excitons generated in the polyfluorene cannot enter the polyethylene glycol layer and so diffuse more than 200 nm. This distance can be tuned by varying the length of the polyethylene glycol—a feature that could potentially be exploited in the development of organic devices such as photovoltaics.

Chemists, on the other hand, have largely had to rely on precious metals such as platinum and rhodium for the task. Friedfeld et al. now report a simple trick to make cobalt act more like rhodium. Reduction of Co(II) to Co(I) by zinc reinforced binding of phosphine ligands to the metal to facilitate its use in asymmetric hydrogenation of alkenes. The cobalt catalysts tolerated alcohol solvents, unlike their rhodium congeners, and could be applied to a 200-gram-scale reduction at 0.08% loading. Science , this issue p. 888"
https://openalex.org/W2804949762,"Forcing the East Asian summer monsoon What factors have controlled the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon over the recent geological past? To answer this key question requires a robust proxy for rainfall amounts. Beck et al. measured the beryllium isotopic content of loess from China, from which they reconstructed a 550,000-year-long record of rainfall. Rainfall correlated with orbital precession and global variations in ice volume. This finding suggests that the monsoon is governed by low-latitude interhemispheric gradients in solar radiation levels, rather than by high-northern-latitude solar radiation levels as previously suggested.

Jin et al. used a heterostructure made out of adjacent layers of WSe 2 and WS 2 to create a spin-valley diffusion current without applying an external electric field. Instead, they used circularly polarized laser light to initiate the diffusion and a second laser pulse to image the propagation of the carriers. With long lifetimes and diffusion lengths, the method may be of practical use in future valleytronic devices. Science , this issue p. 893"

https://openalex.org/W2804135104,"Background In April 2010, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in the infant immunisation schedule in England and Wales. Despite limited serotype replacement in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) during the first four post-PCV13 years, non-vaccine type (NVT) IPD increased substantially in 2014/15. We undertook a carriage study in 2015/16 to help understand the reasons for this increase. Methods and findings Families with a child aged <5 years attending a participating general practice in Gloucestershire or Hertfordshire were invited to provide nasopharyngeal swabs from all consenting members. Swabs from 650 individuals (293 under five, 73 five to twenty and 284 >twenty years) were cultured and serotyped for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Results were compared with those from three previous household studies conducted in the same populations between 2001 to 2013, and with the serotypes causing IPD to estimate case-carrier ratios (CCRs). Overall carriage prevalence did not differ between the four carriage studies with reductions in vaccine-type carriage offset by increases in NVT carriage. While no individual NVT serotype showed an increase in CCR from 2012/13, the composition of the serotypes comprising the NVT group differed such that the overall CCR of the NVT group had significantly increased since 2012/13. Carriage of two PCV13 serotypes, 3 and 19A, was found in 2015/16 (3/650 = 0.5% and 2/650 = 0.3% respectively) with no overall reduction in carriage prevalence of PCV13-7 serotypes since 2012/13, though 6C prevalence, a vaccine-related serotype, had reduced from 1.8% in 2012/13 to 2/648 (0.3%) in 2015/16, p = 0.013. Conclusions There was continuing evolution in carried NVTs six years after PCV13 introduction which, in addition to being vaccine-driven, could also reflect natural secular changes in certain NVTs. This poses challenges in predicting future trends in IPD. Elimination of carriage and disease due to serotypes 3 and 19A may not be achieved by PCV13."
https://openalex.org/W2803693622,"Background This study investigated whether postpartum anxiety disorder is associated to altered patterns of infant as well as maternal engagement in a Face-to-Face-Still-Face interaction (FFSF). Sampling and methods n = 39 women with postpartum DSM-IV anxiety disorder and n = 48 healthy mothers were videotaped during a FFSF with their infant (M = 4.1 months). Results Infants of the clinical group showed significantly less positive engagement during the play episode than infants of controls. This result depended on infant sex: male controls demonstrated more positive interaction than males of anxious mothers. There was no such effect for female infants who engaged significantly less positively during the play episode than males and did not change their positive engagement during the FFSF. These findings imply pronounced interactive positivity and early vulnerability to maternal anxiety symptoms in male infants. Only the infants of the controls showed the still-face effect. They also protested significantly more during the still-face, while the clinical infants’ protest increased significantly during the reunion. Women of both groups did not differ in their interaction. Maternal intrusiveness was associated to infant protest in the course of the FFSF. Conclusions Results suggest that mother-infant intervention should consider affect regulation and infant sex-specific characteristics in anxious mother-infant dyads."
https://openalex.org/W2804062412,"There is a rapid growing body of knowledge regarding physical aspects of a football match due to studies using computer-assisted motion analysis. The present study used time-motion analysis and triaxial-accelerometers to obtain new insights about differences in physical profiles of elite football players across playing-positions. Player performance data in 23 official home matches from a professional football club, during two seasons were collected for analysis. Eighteen players from five different playing positions (central backs: n = 3; full-backs: n = 5; central midfielders: n = 6; wide midfielders: n = 3; and central forwards: n = 4), performing a total of 138 observations. A novel finding was that central backs and central midfielders had significantly lower work-rate in sprints, decelerations and accelerations than full-backs, wide midfielders and central forwards (p<0.001). Furthermore, wide midfielders and full-backs performed significantly more turns (>90°) than central backs. The most common distance covered in high-intensity runs (≥19.8 km·h-1) for central backs, central midfielders, wide midfielders and central forwards was 1-5 m, but for full-backs was 6-10 m. This may help coaches in developing individualized training programs to meet the demands of each position in match-play."
https://openalex.org/W2803846504,"Antimicrobials have been used in a prophylactic way to decrease the incidence of digestive disorders during the piglet post-weaning period. Nowadays, it is urgent to reduce their consumption in livestock to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, the effect of a product on piglet microbiota has been investigated as an alternative to antimicrobials. Three groups of ten post-weaning pigs were sampled at 0, 15 and 30 days one week post-weaning; the control, antibiotic and feed additive group received a standard post-weaning diet without antibiotics or additives, the same diet as the control group but with amoxicillin and colistin sulphate and the same diet as the control group but with a feed additive (Sanacore-EN, Nutriad International N.V.), respectively. The total DNA extracted from faeces was used to amplify the 16S RNA gene for massive sequencing under manufacturer’s conditions. Sequencing data was quality filtered and analyzed using QIIME software and suitable statistical methods. In general terms, age modifies significantly the microbiota of the piglets. Thus, the oldest the animal, the highest bacterial diversity observed for the control and the feed additive groups. However, this diversity was very similar in the antibiotic group throughout the trial. Interestingly, a clear increase in abundance of Bacillus and Lactobacillus spp was detected within the feed additive group versus the antibiotic and control groups. In conclusion, the feed additive group had a positive effect in the endogenous microbiota of post-weaning pigs increasing both, the diversity of bacterial families and the abundance of lactic acid bacteria during the post-weaning period."
https://openalex.org/W2803477862,"In order to compute the continuum of care for French Guiana, it is necessary to estimate the total number of persons living with HIV. The main objective was to determine how many persons were infected with HIV and how many were unaware of it.We used 2 different models to calculate the total number of persons infected with HIV: Spectrum's AIM module using CSAVR to compute incidence from case registration and vital statistics; and the ECDC model from the French Guiana HIV cohort data.The present results show that both models led to similar results regarding the incident number of cases (i.e. for 2016 174 versus 161) and the total HIV population (in 2016 3206 versus 3539) respectively. The ECDC modeling tool showed that the proportion of undiagnosed HIV infections declined from 50% in 1990 to 15% in 2015. This amounted to a stable or slightly increasing total number of undiagnosed patients of 520.The estimations of the total HIV population by both models show that the HIV population is still growing. The incidence rate declined in 2000 and the decline of the number of newly acquired HIV infections, after a decline after 2003 is offset by population growth. The proportion of undiagnosed infections has declined to 15% but the number of undiagnosed infections remains stable. The HIV cascade shows that despite good results for treatment in care, reaching the 90*90*90 UNAIDS target may be difficult because a significant proportion of patients are lost to follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2804443706,"Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis and progression of hepa tocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the functional mechanisms of miR-205 in HCC remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that miR-205 expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines and was correlated with metastatic pathologic features and shorter disease-free and overall survival. Overexpression of miR-205 dramatically inhibited HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. We subsequently identified semaphorin 4C (SEMA4C) as a novel target of miR-205. Furthermore, high expression levels of SEMA4C were frequently found in HCC tissues and were associated with poor prognosis. Ectopic expression of SEMA4C restored the suppressive effect of overex pressed miR-205 on migration, invasion, and EMT. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into the critical role of miR-205 in regulating tumor growth, invasion, and EMT of HCC, suggesting miR-205 may serve as a promising therapeutic target and novel prognostic indicator for patients with HCC.—Lu, J., Lin, Y., Li, F., Ye, H., Zhou, R., Jin, Y., Li, B., Xiong, X., Cheng, N.

https://openalex.org/W2804091692,"Active learning is a pedagogical approach that involves students engaging in collaborative learning, which enables them to take more responsibility for their learning and improve their critical thinking skills. While prior research examined student performance at majority universities, this study focuses on specifically Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for the first time. Here we present work that focuses on the impact of active learning interventions at Florida A&M University, where we measured the impact of active learning strategies coupled with a SCALE-UP (Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies) learning environment on student success in General Biology. In biology sections where active learning techniques were employed, students watched online videos and completed specific activities before class covering information previously presented in a traditional lecture format. In-class activities were then carefully planned to reinforce critical concepts and enhance critical thinking skills through active learning techniques such as the one-minute paper, think-pair-share, and the utilization of clickers. Students in the active learning and control groups covered the same topics, took the same summative examinations and completed identical homework sets. In addition, the same instructor taught all of the sections included in this study. Testing demonstrated that these interventions increased learning gains by as much as 16%, and students reported an increase in their positive perceptions of active learning and biology. Overall, our results suggest that active learning approaches coupled with the SCALE-UP environment may provide an added opportunity for student success when compared with the standard modes of instruction in General Biology."
https://openalex.org/W2803630889,"FAM19A1 is a member of the family with sequence similarity 19 with unknown function. FAM19A1 mRNA expression is restricted to the CNS. Here, we report that FAM19A1 is a classic secretory protein, and expression levels correlate with brain development, increasing from embryonic d 12.5, peaking between postnatal d (P)1 and P7 and decreasing at wk 8. The adult hippocampus is a region of FAM19A1 high expression. Recombinant FAM19A1 sup pressed the proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) and altered the lineage progression of NSCs with promoted neuron differentiation and suppressed astrocyte differentiation. Although GPCR1 (GPR1) has been reported to be expressed in the CNS, its functions in the brain remain unclear. We identified GPR1 to be a functional receptor for FAM19A1. FAM19A1 interacted with GPR1 via the N-terminal domain (GPR1-ND), and its NSC modulatory functions required the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) /ERK1/2 and ROCK/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathways. GPR1-ND that selectively bound to FAM19A1 neutralized the effects of FAM19A1 on NSC functions. Taken together, our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that FAM19A1 is a novel regulatory factor of the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs, and identified a novel mechanism by which GPCR mediates the effects of FAM19A1 on NSC functions that may be important for brain development and neurogenesis. Additional exploration of the functions of FAM19A1 and GPR1 in the CNS may broaden the range of therapeutic options available for major brain disorders.—Zheng, C., Chen, D., Zhang, Y., Bai, Y., Huang, S., Zheng, D., Liang, W., She, S., Peng, X., Wang, P., Mo, X., Song, Q., Lv, P., Huang, J., Ye, R.

https://openalex.org/W2804588987,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by hyperplastic pannus formation mediated by activated synovial fibroblasts that cause joint destruction. We have shown earlier that RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) exhibit resistance to apoptosis, primarily as a result of enhanced expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). In this study, we discovered that ursolic acid (UA), a plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenoid, selectively induces B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3-only protein Noxa in human RASFs. We observed that UA-induced Noxa expression was followed by a consequent decrease in Mcl-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequent evaluation of the signaling pathways showed that UA-induced Noxa is primarily mediated by the JNK pathway in human RASFs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) studies into the promoter region of Noxa indicated the role of transcription factor spec ificity protein 1 in JNK-mediated Noxa expression. Furthermore, the results from IP studies and proximity ligation assays indicated that UA-induced Noxa colocalizes and associates with Mcl-1 to prime it for proteasomal degra dation through K48-linked ubiquitination by the selective recruitment of Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3, a homologous to E6-associated protein C terminus domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase. These findings unveil a novel mechanism of inducing apoptosis in RASFs and a potential adjunct therapeutic strategy of regulating synovial hyperplasia in RA.—Kim, E. Y., Sudini, K., Singh, A.

https://openalex.org/W2804255748,"Ischemic stroke remains an important cause of disability and mortality. Hypertension is a critical risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke. Control of risk factors, including hypertension, is therefore important for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Linalyl acetate (LA) has been reported to have therapeutic effects in ischemic stroke by modulating intracellular Ca2+ concentration and having anti-oxidative properties. The preventive efficacy of LA has not yet been determined. This study therefore investigated the preventive efficacy of LA in rat aortas exposed to hypertension related-ischemic injury, and the mechanism of action of LA.Hypertension was induced in vivo following ischemic injury to the aorta induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation in vitro. Effects of LA were assayed by western blotting, by determining concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by vascular contractility assays. LA significantly reduced systolic blood pressure in vivo. In vitro, LA suppressed ischemic injury-induced expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit p47phox, as well as ROS production, LDH release, and ROS-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase suppression. These findings indicate that LA has anti-hypertensive properties that can prevent hypertension-related ischemic injury and can prevent NADPH oxidase-induced production of ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2803451916,"Leishmaniasis is one of the diverse and neglected tropical diseases. Embryo-toxicity of drugs has always been a major concern. Chick embryo is a preclinical model relevant in the assessment of adverse effects of drugs. The current study aimed to assess embryonic histopathological disorders and amniotic fluid biochemical changes following meglumine antimoniate treatment. The alteration of vascular branching pattern in the chick’s extra-embryonic membrane and exploration of molecular cues to early embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis were also quantified. Embryonated chicken eggs were treated with 75 or 150 mg/kg of meglumine antimoniate. Embryo malformations, growth retardation and haemorrhages on the external body surfaces were accompanied by histopathological lesions in the brain, kidney, liver and heart in a dose-dependent manner. Significant rise occurred in the biochemical indices of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and amylase in the amniotic fluid. Quantification of the extra-embryonic membrane vasculature showed that the anti-angiogenic and anti-vasculogenic effects of the drug were revealed by a significant decrease in fractal dimension value and mean capillary area. The relative expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 mRNA also significantly reduced. Concerns of a probable teratogenicity of meglumine antimoniate were established by data presented in this study. It is concluded that tissue lesions, amniotic fluid disturbance, altered early extra-embryonic vascular development and gene expression as well as the consecutive cascade of events, might eventually lead to developmental defects in embryo following meglumine antimoniate treatment. Therefore, the use of meglumine antimoniate during pregnancy should be considered as potentially embryo-toxic. Hence, physicians should be aware of such teratogenic effects and limit the use of this drug during the growing period of the fetus, particularly in rural communities. Further pharmaceutical investigations are crucial for planning future strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2803631197,"The aim of this study was to examine eye movements and postural control performance among dyslexic children while reading a text and performing the Landolt reading task. Fifteen dyslexic and 15 non-dyslexic children were asked to stand upright while performing two experimental visual tasks: text reading and Landolt reading. In the text reading task, children were asked to silently read a text displayed on a monitor, while in the Landolt reading task, the letters in the text were replaced by closed circles and Landolt rings, and children were asked to scan each circle/ring in a reading-like fashion, from left to right, and to count the number of Landolt rings. Eye movements (Mobile T2®, SuriCog) and center of pressure excursions (Framiral®, Grasse, France) were recorded. Visual performance variables were total reading time, mean duration of fixation, number of pro- and retro-saccades, and amplitude of pro-saccades. Postural performance variable was the center of pressure area. The results showed that dyslexic children spent more time reading the text and had a longer duration of fixation than non-dyslexic children. However, no difference was observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children in the Landolt reading task. Dyslexic children performed a higher number of pro- and retro-saccades than non-dyslexic children in both text reading and Landolt reading tasks. Dyslexic children had smaller pro-saccade amplitude than non-dyslexic children in the text reading task. Finally, postural performance was poorer in dyslexic children than in non-dyslexic children. Reading difficulties in dyslexic children are related to eye movement strategies required to scan and obtain lexical and semantic meaning. However, postural control performance, which was poor in dyslexic children, is not related to lexical and semantic reading requirements and might not also be related to different eye movement behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2804110397,"Open lung biopsy (OLB) is a rare procedure in intensive care units (ICUs) for therapeutic management of acute respiratory failure (ARF). The purpose of this study was to analyze the diagnostic yield, therapeutic contribution and complications of OLB in ICU patients with ARF of unclear etiology, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ARDS mimics.Retrospective study conducted in a 10-bed ICU over a 13-year period. Patients undergoing OLB for ARF with undiagnosed infiltrates on CT scan were included. ARDS was defined according to Berlin criteria, and ARDS mimics as a condition looking like ARDS except for the presence of a known cause. OLB was contributive when the OLB findings yielded a specific diagnosis resulting in a change in the patients' treatment or management.Forty six patients were included (sex ratio = 2.5, median and [interquartile range] age = 69 [59-77] years, and admission SAPS II = 42 [33-50]. ARF corresponded to ARDS in 22 patients and to ARDS mimics in 16. OLB yielded 61 diagnoses in 45 patients including diffuse alveolar damage (N = 21), lung fibrosis (N = 18), and organizing pneumonia (N = 11). OLB was contributive in 37 patients (80%), including 13/16 ARDS mimickers. The main contributions of OLB were the introduction or maintenance of steroids (N = 32) and discontinuation of antibiotics (N = 9). In 4 patients OLB resulted directly in the decision to forgo life-sustaining treatment. OLB complications occurred in 16 patients (35%), in one case associated with fatal outcome.OLB can play a useful role in the management of ICU patients with ARF of undetermined origin, including ARDS mimickers. Further studies should be done to identify the groups of ICU patients likely to benefit from the procedure with minimum risk."
https://openalex.org/W2804148457,"Background Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC). The accuracy of residual disease measurement and reporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for these patients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed is the greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response. Fluorescence imaging (FI) is a new technology that is being evaluated for use in the detection of tumors in different oncological conditions. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is able to detect residual breast tumor tissue after NACT in breast surgical operative specimens. Methods Patients who underwent NACT for BC and were admitted for breast surgery were selected for participation in this study. Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injected intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated on ex vivo samples from the surgical specimen. Results One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Among them, 52 were malignant (30.2%) and 120 were benign (69.8%). The mean TBFR was 3.3 (SD 1.68) in malignant samples and 1.9 (SD 0.97) in benign samples (p = 0.0002). With a TBFR cut-off value of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, false negative rate, and false positive rate of ICG-FI to predict residual tumoral disease in breast surgical samples post-NACT were 94.2%, 31.7%, 92.7%, 5.8%, and 68.3%, respectively. If we restricted our analysis to only patients who achieved pCR, the negative predictive value for ICG-FI was 100%. Conclusions These first observations indicate that ex vivo ICG-FI is sensitive but not sufficiently specific to discriminate between benign breast tissue and malignant residual tissue. Nevertheless, its negative predictive value seems sufficiently accurate to exclude the presence of residual breast tumor tissue on the operative specimen of patients treated by NACT, representing a potential tool to assist pathologists in the assessment of breast surgical specimens."

https://openalex.org/W2803982410,"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic cancer. Poly-chemotherapy with cytotoxic and genotoxic drugs causes substantial toxicity and more specific therapies targeting the underlying molecular lesions are highly desired. Perturbed Ras signaling is prevalent in T-ALL and occurs via oncogenic RAS mutations or through overexpression of the Ras activator RasGRP1 in ~65% of T-ALL patients. Effective small molecule inhibitors for either target do not currently exist. Genetic and biochemical evidence link phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signals to T-ALL, PI3Ks are activated by Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms, and potent PI3K inhibitors exist. Here we performed comprehensive analyses of PI3K-Akt signaling in T-ALL with a focus on class I PI3K. We developed a multiplex, multiparameter flow cytometry platform with pan- and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors. We find that pan-PI3K and PI3K γ-specific inhibitors effectively block basal and cytokine-induced PI3K-Akt signals. Despite such inhibition, GDC0941 (pan-PI3K) or AS-605240 (PI3Kγ-specific) as single agents did not efficiently induce death in T-ALL cell lines. Combination of GDC0941 with AS-605240, maximally targeting all p110 isoforms, exhibited potent synergistic activity for clonal T-ALL lines in vitro, which motivated us to perform preclinical trials in mice. In contrast to clonal T-ALL lines, we used a T-ALL cancer model that recapitulates the multi-step pathogenesis and inter- and intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity, a hallmark of advanced human cancers. We found that the combination of GDC0941 with AS-605240 fails in such trials. Our results reveal that PI3K inhibitors are a promising avenue for molecular therapy in T-ALL, but predict the requirement for methods that can resolve biochemical signals in heterogeneous cell populations so that combination therapy can be designed in a rational manner."
https://openalex.org/W2804315065,"As the production of non-traditional export (NTX) crops by smallholder households in developing countries expands, there is a compelling need to understand the potential effects of this type of agricultural production on household food security and nutrition. We use two household surveys with a sample of 52 households, interviews, and focus groups to examine whether smallholder farmers who produce broccoli for export in a rural Guatemalan community have different household food security than farmers in the same community who are still growing traditional maize and bean crops. We explore and compare the food security status of broccoli farmers (adopters) and traditional farmers (non-adopters) across four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. Adopters earned significantly more income (40%) than non-adopters, but higher incomes did not coincide with improvements in food availability, food access, or food utilization. Results indicate that adopters and non-adopters alike struggle with access to food, while the intensity of broccoli production may be undermining the ability of local agricultural systems to naturally control pests and regulate nutrients. More systematic approaches to food security assessment, especially those that consider all four dimensions of food security, are needed to better target interventions designed to alleviate food insecurity among rural smallholders."
https://openalex.org/W2804286618,"Urban extent data play an important role in urban management and urban studies, such as monitoring the process of urbanization and changes in the spatial configuration of urban areas. Traditional methods of extracting urban-extent information are primarily based on manual investigations and classifications using remote sensing images, and these methods have such problems as large costs in labor and time and low precision. This study proposes an improved, simplified and flexible method for extracting urban extents over multiple scales and the construction of spatiotemporal models using DMSP/OLS nighttime light (NTL) for practical situations. This method eliminates the regional temporal and spatial inconsistency of thresholding NTL in large-scale and multi-temporal scenes. Using this method, we have extracted the urban extents and calculated the corresponding areas on the county, municipal and provincial scales in China from 2000 to 2012. In addition, validation with the data of reference data shows that the overall accuracy (OA), Kappa and F1 Scores were 0.996, 0.793, and 0.782, respectively. We increased the spatial resolution of the urban extent to 500 m (approximately four times finer than the results of previous studies). Based on the urban extent dataset proposed above, we analyzed changes in urban extents over time and observed that urban sprawl has grown in all of the counties of China. We also identified three patterns of urban sprawl: Early Urban Growth, Constant Urban Growth and Recent Urban Growth. In addition, these trends of urban sprawl are consistent with the western, eastern and central cities of China, respectively, in terms of their spatial distribution, socioeconomic characteristics and historical background. Additionally, the urban extents display the spatial configurations of urban areas intuitively. The proposed urban extent dataset is available for download and can provide reference data and support for future studies of urbanization and urban planning."

Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in Pichia pastoris and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution."
https://openalex.org/W2804763122,"Objective In the liver, a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH) is oxidative stress, which leads to the accumulation of highly reactive electrophilic α/β unsaturated aldehydes. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of NASH on protein carbonylation and antioxidant responses in a murine model. Methods Liver-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deletion mice (PTENLKO) or control littermates were fed a standard chow diet for 45–55 weeks followed by analysis for liver injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. Results Histology and Picrosirius red-staining of collagen deposition within the extracellular matrix revealed extensive steatosis and fibrosis in the PTENLKO mice but no steatosis or fibrosis in controls. Increased steatosis and fibrosis corresponded with significant increases in inflammation. PTEN-deficient livers showed significantly increased cell-specific oxidative damage, as detected by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and acrolein staining. Elevated staining correlated with an increase in nuclear DNA repair foci (γH2A.X) and cellular proliferation index (Ki67) within zones 1 and 3, indicating oxidative damage was zonally restricted and was associated with increased DNA damage and cell proliferation. Immunoblots showed that total levels of antioxidant response proteins induced by nuclear factor erythroid-2-like-2 (Nrf2), including GSTμ, GSTπ and CBR1/3, but not HO-1, were elevated in PTENLKO as compared to controls, and IHC showed this response also occurred only in zones 1 and 3. Furthermore, an analysis of autophagy markers revealed significant elevation of p62 and LC3II expression. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis identified significantly more carbonylated proteins in whole cell extracts prepared from PTENLKO mice (966) as compared to controls (809). Pathway analyses of identified proteins did not uncover specific pathways that were preferentially carbonylated in PTENLKO livers but, did reveal specific strongly increased carbonylation of thioredoxin reductase and of glutathione-S-transferases (GST) M6, O1, and O2. Conclusions Results show that disruption of PTEN resulted in steatohepatitis, fibrosis and caused hepatic induction of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant system at least in part due to elevation of p62. This response was both cell-type and zone specific. However, these responses were insufficient to mitigate the accumulation of products of lipid peroxidation."

However, if a weekend effect exists in orthotopic liver transplantation (oLT).We analyzed oLT between 2006 and 2016 and stratified patients into weekday (Monday to Friday) and weekend (Saturday, Sunday) groups. Primary outcome measures were one-year patient and graft survival.364 deceased donor livers were transplanted into 329 patients with 246 weekday (74.77%) and 83 weekend (25.23%) patients. Potential confounders (e.g. age, ischemia time, MELD score) were comparable. One-year patient and graft survival were similar. Frequencies of rejections, primary-non function or re-transplantation were not different. The day of transplantation was not associated with one-year patient and graft survival in multivariate analysis.We provide the first data for the Eurotransplant region on oLT stratified for weekend and weekday procedures and our findings suggest there was no weekend effect on oLT. While we hypothesize that the absent weekend effect is due to standardized transplant procedures and specialized multidisciplinary transplant teams, our results are encouraging showing oLT is a safe and successful procedure, independent from the day of the week."
https://openalex.org/W2803806620,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF. Findings Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF. Conclusions The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant."

https://openalex.org/W2803692268,"A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results. Importantly, the efficiency of this method is guaranteed to accelerate the assembly of vesicles composed of several thousand lipids by up to 50-fold, rendering the experimental liposome dynamics as well as membrane-peptide interactions feasible at accessible computational expense."

We studied the gonads of parents and offspring from direct and reciprocal crosses through histological and transcriptome analyses. The triploid offspring had inferior ability to form sperm and egg cells compared with diploid forms. After sequencing the transcriptomes, 655,109,158 clean reads were obtained, and 62,821 unigenes and 178,962 transcripts were assembled. Of these unigenes, 23,189 were annotated in the GO database, 18,525 in the KEGG database and 24,661 in the KOG database. 36 fertility-related genes were found to be differentially expressed between the direct cross (2n × 4n) progenies and their parents, while 53 fertility-related genes between the reciprocal cross (4n × 2n) progenies and their parents. Following protein-protein interaction network analyses, 54 differentially expressed genes, including PLCB4, cyp17a1 and Pla2g4d, were mined, yielding candidate genes involved in the poor fertility of hybrid triploid loaches. This is the first report of transcriptomes of gonads of hybrid triploid loaches and their parents, offering a substantial contribution to sequence resources for this species and providing a deep insight into the molecular mechanism controlling the fertility of hybrid triploid fish."
https://openalex.org/W2804329804,"The availability of large-scale screens of host-virus interaction interfaces enabled the topological analysis of viral protein targets of the host. In particular, host proteins that bind viral proteins are generally hubs and proteins with high betweenness centrality. Recently, other topological measures were introduced that a virus may tap to infect a host cell. Utilizing experimentally determined sets of human protein targets from Herpes, Hepatitis, HIV and Influenza, we pooled molecular interactions between proteins from different pathway databases. Apart from a protein's degree and betweenness centrality, we considered a protein's pathway participation, ability to topologically control a network and protein PageRank index. In particular, we found that proteins with increasing values of such measures tend to accumulate viral targets and distinguish viral targets from non-targets. Furthermore, all such topological measures strongly correlate with the occurrence of a given protein in different pathways. Building a random forest classifier that is based on such topological measures, we found that protein PageRank index had the highest impact on the classification of viral (non-)targets while proteins' ability to topologically control an interaction network played the least important role."

Based on the crucial role of hippocampal neurogenesis disturbance in the process of depression and anxiety, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether B2M leads to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. We found that 6 days after intracerebroventricular injection with B2M (0.3 μg), the immobility times of rats in the tail suspension test and the forced swimming test were increased, the swimming and climbing time in the forced swimming test was decreased, and the latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding test was increased, indicating that B2M induces depressive-like behaviors. In addition, in the elevated plus maze test, B2M-treated rats displayed obvious decline in the number of entries into and the proportion of time spent in the open arm, while the number of total arm entries was no change, which indicated that B2M induces anxiety-like behaviors. Our present findings suggest that target B2M might represent a novel approach for treatment of depression and anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2803905253,"Iron-loading disorders, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, are associated with inappropriately low expression of the iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin. A recent study has demonstrated that food deprivation can increase hepcidin production in mice. We have examined this effect in more detail to determine whether the pathway(s) that are responsible might provide novel targets for pharmaceutical intervention in disorders of iron homeostasis. C57BL/6 mice were deprived of food for 5, 10, 16, or 24 h before euthanasia, then blood and tissue samples were collected for analysis. The effect of food deprivation was also examined in Hfe−/− mice, a model of hereditary hemochromatosis, as well as mice that were maintained on an iron-deficient diet or injected with erythropoietin. Food deprivation increased the hepatic expression of the gene that encodes hepcidin, hepcidin antimicrobial peptide 1 (Hamp1), with maximal expression observed after 16 h, and was able to overcome the reduction in Hamp1 expression associated with Hfe deficiency. Food deprivation also increased Hamp1 expression in response to stimuli that more strongly suppress the gene, such as iron deficiency and erythropoietin treatment, but the effects were not significant. These results indicate that Hamp1 induction by food deprivation is independent of HFE and suggest that targeting the pathway regulated by food deprivation could have clinical benefit in iron loading conditions.—Mirciov, C.

https://openalex.org/W2804897001,"Thyroid function is controlled by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which binds to its G protein-coupled receptor [thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)] on thyrocytes. TSHR can potentially couple to all G protein families, but it mainly activates the Gs- and Gq/11-mediated signaling cascades. To date, there is a knowledge gap concerning the role of the individual G protein cascades in thyroid pathophysiology. Here, we demonstrate that the thyrocyte-specific deletion of Gs protein α subunit (Gαs) in adult mice [tamoxifen-inducible Gs protein a subunit deficient (iTGαsKO) mice] rapidly impairs thyrocyte function and leads to hypothyroidism. Consequently, iTGasKO mice show reduced food intake and activity. However, body weight and the amount of white adipose tissue were decreased only in male iTGαsKO mice. Unexpectedly, hyperplastic follicles and papillary thyroid cancer-like tumor lesions with increased proliferation and slightly increased phospho-ERK1/2 staining were found in iTGαsKO mice at an older age. These tumors developed from nonrecombined thyrocytes still expressing Gαs in the presence of highly elevated serum TSH. In summary, we report that partial thyrocyte-specific Gαs deletion leads to hypothyroidism but also to tumor development in thyrocytes with remaining Gαs expression. Thus, these mice are a novel model to elucidate the patho physiological consequences of hypothyroidism and TSHR/G</cAMP-mediated tumorigenesis.—Patyra, K., Jaeschke, H., Löf, C., Jännäri, M., Ruohonen, S.

https://openalex.org/W2803181978,"Infectious disease has shaped the natural genetic diversity of humans throughout the world. A new approach to capture positive selection driven by pathogens would provide information regarding pathogen exposure in distinct human populations and the constantly evolving arms race between host and disease-causing agents. We created a human pathogen interaction database and used the integrated haplotype score (iHS) to detect recent positive selection in genes that interact with proteins from 26 different pathogens. We used the Human Genome Diversity Panel to identify specific populations harboring pathogen-interacting genes that have undergone positive selection. We found that human genes that interact with 9 pathogen species show evidence of recent positive selection. These pathogens are Yersenia pestis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1, Zaire ebolavirus, Francisella tularensis, dengue virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus, Rubella virus, and Bacillus anthracis. For HIV-1, GWAS demonstrate that some naturally selected variants in the host-pathogen protein interaction networks continue to have functional consequences for susceptibility to these pathogens. We show that selected human genes were enriched for HIV susceptibility variants (identified through GWAS), providing further support for the hypothesis that ancient humans were exposed to lentivirus pandemics. Human genes in the Italian, Miao, and Biaka Pygmy populations that interact with Y. pestis show significant signs of selection. These results reveal some of the genetic footprints created by pathogens in the human genome that may have left lasting marks on susceptibility to infectious disease."

Due to the difficulty of estimating the daily exposure to light; research is needed to determine how much natural and man-made lights could affect the cornea. Visible light radiation could have damaging effect on the human eye; the type and degree of damage are related to the duration and the cumulative exposure as well as to the intensity of the rays. There are noticeable increases in using electronic devices and colored lamps in decoration and toys as well, without any specific regulation. We studied the effect of such human activity on the corneal structure and the vibrational characteristics of corneal tissue by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. To achieve these goals, Chinchilla rabbits were exposed to two different lux of blue, green or red color lamps. The results indicate that the corneal tissue responds non-specifically to each lux and accordingly the color. The detected changes are including corneal protein secondary structure as well as lipids, in particular phospholipids. This was concomitant with more ordered membrane bilayer and changes in the corneal membrane phase organization. No lux/color-response relationship was established."

We cloned Chk1 from the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). The full-length cDNA sequence of PmChk1 had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of PmChk1 (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that PmChk1 was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of P. monodon. The lowest PmChk1 expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in P. monodon. PmChk1 expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in P. monodon ovaries. RNA interference experiments were undertaken to examine the expression of PmChk1, PmCDC2, and PmCyclin B. PmChk1 knockdown in the ovaries and hepatopancreas by dsRNA-Chk1 was successful. The localization and level of PmChk1 expression in the hepatopancreas was studied using in situ hybridization, which showed that data were in accordance with those of qRT-PCR. The Gonadosomatic Index of P. monodon after dsRNA-Chk1 injection was significantly higher than that after injection of dsRNA-GFP or phosphate-buffered saline. These data suggest that PmChk1 may have important roles in the ovarian maturation of P. monodon."

Therefore, we hypothesized that lower fresh fruit consumption is associated with higher risk of incident albuminuria among Chinese adults in rural areas, where fresh fruit consumption level is very low and prevalence of albuminuria is high.We tested the hypothesis in a village-based cohort study of 3574 participants aged ≥ 30 years from the Handan Eye Study conducted from 2006 to 2013. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g.Overall, 35.4% of the participants never or rarely consumed fresh fruits, and 33.9, 21.6, and 9.1% consumed fresh fruits 1-3 times/month, 1-2 times/week, and ≥ 3 times/week, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 5.6 years, albuminuria developed in 17.6% (n = 629) of the participants. Compared with participants who consumed fresh fruits ≥ 3 times/week, the multivariable adjustment odds ratios (ORs) for incident albuminuria associated with fruit consumption 1-2 times/week, 1-3 times/month, and no or rare consumption were 1.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.05-2.40), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.17-2.58), and 1.78 (95% CI, 1.20-2.64), respectively.

Objectives To compare CAWCS pharmacy-dispensed (PD) drug prices under alternative fee schedules, and identify combinations of alternative benchmarks that have prices available for the largest percentage of PD drugs and that best reach budget neutrality. Methods Claims transaction-level data (2011–2013) from CAWCS were used to estimate total annual PD pharmaceutical payments. Medi-Cal pricing data was from the Workman’s Compensation Insurance System (WCIS). Average Wholesale Prices (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), Direct Prices (DP), Federal Upper Limit (FUL) prices, and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) were from Medi-Span. We matched National Drug Codes (NDCs), pricing dates, and drug quantity for comparisons. We report pharmacy-dispensed (PD) claims frequency, reimbursement matching rate, and paid costs by CAWCS as the reference price against all alternative price benchmarks. Results Of 12,529,977 CAWCS claims for pharmaceutical products 11.6% (1,462,814) were for PD drugs. Prescription drug cost for CAWCS was over $152M; $63.9M, $47.9M, and $40.6M in 2011–2013. Ninety seven percent of these CAWCS PD claims had a Medi-Cal price. Alternative mechanisms provided a price for fewer claims; NADAC 94.23%, AWP 90.94%, FUL 73.11%, WAC 66.98%, and DP 14.33%. Among CAWCS drugs with no Medi-Cal price in PD claims, AWP, WAC, NADAC, DP, and FUL provided prices for 96.7%, 63.14%, 24.82%, 20.83%, and 15.08% of claims. Overall CAWCS paid 100.52% of Medi-Cal, 60% of AWP, 97% of WAC, 309.53% of FUL, 103.83% of DP, and 136.27% of NADAC. Conclusions CAWCS current Medi-Cal fee-schedule price list for PD drugs is more complete than all alternative fee-schedules. However, all reimbursement approaches would require combinations of pricing benchmarks. We suggest keeping primary reimbursement at 100% of Medi-Cal and for drugs without a primary Medi-Cal price calculating the maximum fee as 60% of AWP and then 97% of WAC. Alternatively, we suggest using NADAC as a primary fee-schedule followed by either 60% AWP and 97% WAC or AWP-40% for drugs with no NADAC price. Fee-schedules may not offer the best price and a formulary approach may provide more flexibility."

The main outcome measures were the postoperative mean angle of horizontal deviation, the success rate, and the overcorrection rate. Surgical success was defined as an alignment between 10 prism diopters (PD) of exodeviation and 5 PD of esodeviation.The postoperative mean angles of exodeviation, throughout the follow-up period, did not significantly differ between the groups. Although the surgical success rate was higher in group B at postoperative 1 month (p = 0.035), there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups from postoperative 6 months.: The final success rates were 56.3 and 51.6% (p = 0.509). The overcorrection rate was significantly higher in group A at postoperative 1, 6 and 24 months (p = 0.017, p = 0.028, p = 0.030, respectively); however, at the final follow-up, there was no overcorrection in either group.The overcorrection rate was higher in group A until postoperative 2 years, even though the mean angles of exodeviation and the success rates did not significantly differ between the 2 groups.

In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred.
