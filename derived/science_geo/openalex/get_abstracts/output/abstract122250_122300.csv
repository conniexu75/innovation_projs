https://openalex.org/W2007205214,Large-scale synthesis of aligned carbon nanotubes was achieved by using a method based on chemical vapor deposition catalyzed by iron nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous silica. Scanning electron microscope images show that the nanotubes are approximately perpendicular to the surface of the silica and form an aligned array of isolated tubes with spacings between the tubes of about 100 nanometers. The tubes are up to about 50 micrometers long and well graphitized. The growth direction of the nanotubes may be controlled by the pores from which the nanotubes grow.
https://openalex.org/W2044071327,"We measured amygdala activity in human volunteers during rapid visual presentations of fearful, happy, and neutral faces using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The first experiment involved a fixed order of conditions both within and across runs, while the second one used a fully counterbalanced order in addition to a low level baseline of simple visual stimuli. In both experiments, the amygdala was preferentially activated in response to fearful versus neutral faces. In the counterbalanced experiment, the amygdala also responded preferentially to happy versus neutral faces, suggesting a possible generalized response to emotionally valenced stimuli. Rapid habituation effects were prominent in both experiments. Thus, the human amygdala responds preferentially to emotionally valenced faces and rapidly habituates to them."
https://openalex.org/W2008284899,"Neurons in the cortex of behaving animals show temporally irregular spiking patterns. The origin of this irregularity and its implications for neural processing are unknown. The hypothesis that the temporal variability in the firing of a neuron results from an approximate balance between its excitatory and inhibitory inputs was investigated theoretically. Such a balance emerges naturally in large networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations that are sparsely connected by relatively strong synapses. The resulting state is characterized by strongly chaotic dynamics, even when the external inputs to the network are constant in time. Such a network exhibits a linear response, despite the highly nonlinear dynamics of single neurons, and reacts to changing external stimuli on time scales much smaller than the integration time constant of a single neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2095745901,"Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 genes cosegregate with the majority of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) pedigrees. We now document that the Aβ1–42(43)/Aβ1–40 ratio in the conditioned media of independent N2a cell lines expressing three FAD-linked PS1 variants is uniformly elevated relative to cells expressing similar levels of wild-type PS1. Similarly, the Aβ1–42(43)/Aβ1–40 ratio is elevated in the brains of young transgenic animals coexpressing a chimeric amyloid precursor protein (APP) and an FAD-linked PS1 variant compared with brains of transgenic mice expressing APP alone or transgenic mice coexpressing wild-type human PS1 and APP. These studies provide compelling support for the view that one mechanism by which these mutant PS1 cause AD is by increasing the extracellular concentration of Aβ peptides terminating at 42(43), species that foster Aβ deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2011029903,"One of the major limitations in the use of genetically modified mice for studying cognitive functions is the lack of regional and temporal control of gene function. To overcome these limitations, a forebrain-specific promoter was combined with the tetracycline transactivator system to achieve both regional and temporal control of transgene expression. Expression of an activated calcium-independent form of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) resulted in a loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation in response to 10-hertz stimulation and a deficit in spatial memory, a form of explicit memory. Suppression of transgene expression reversed both the physiological and the memory deficit. When the transgene was expressed at high levels in the lateral amygdala and the striatum but not other forebrain structures, there was a deficit in fear conditioning, an implicit memory task, that also was reversible. Thus, the CaMKII signaling pathway is critical for both explicit and implicit memory storage, in a manner that is independent of its potential role in development."
https://openalex.org/W2144583290,"INDEPTH geophysical and geological observations imply that a partially molten midcrustal layer exists beneath southern Tibet. This partially molten layer has been produced by crustal thickening and behaves as a fluid on the time scale of Himalayan deformation. It is confined on the south by the structurally imbricated Indian crust underlying the Tethyan and High Himalaya and is underlain, apparently, by a stiff Indian mantle lid. The results suggest that during Neogene time the underthrusting Indian crust has acted as a plunger, displacing the molten middle crust to the north while at the same time contributing to this layer by melting and ductile flow. Viewed broadly, the Neogene evolution of the Himalaya is essentially a record of the southward extrusion of the partially molten middle crust underlying southern Tibet."
https://openalex.org/W2125312207,"The obesity syndrome of ob/ob mice results from lack of leptin, a hormone released by fat cells that acts in the brain to suppress feeding and stimulate metabolism. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neuromodulator implicated in the control of energy balance and is overproduced in the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice. To determine the role of NPY in the response to leptin deficiency, ob/ob mice deficient for NPY were generated. In the absence of NPY, ob/ob mice are less obese because of reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure, and are less severely affected by diabetes, sterility, and somatotropic defects. These results suggest that NPY is a central effector of leptin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2011335067,"In a 12-year experimental study of nitrogen (N) deposition on Minnesota grasslands, plots dominated by native warm-season grasses shifted to low-diversity mixtures dominated by cool-season grasses at all but the lowest N addition rates. This shift was associated with decreased biomass carbon (C):N ratios, increased N mineralization, increased soil nitrate, high N losses, and low C storage. In addition, plots originally dominated by nonnative cool-season grasses retained little added N and stored little C, even at low N input rates. Thus, grasslands with high N retention and C storage rates were the most vulnerable to species losses and major shifts in C and N cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1989938166,"AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are not thought to be involved in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), but may be involved in its expression via second messenger pathways. However, one subunit of the AMPARs, GluR2, is also known to control Ca2+ influx. To test whether GluR2 plays any role in the induction of LTP, we generated mice that lacked this subunit. In GluR2 mutants, LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices was markedly enhanced (2-fold) and nonsaturating, whereas neuronal excitability and paired-pulse facilitation were normal. The 9-fold increase in Ca2+ permeability, in response to kainate application, suggests one possible mechanism for enhanced LTP. Mutant mice exhibited increased mortality, and those surviving showed reduced exploration and impaired motor coordination. These results suggest an important role for GluR2 in regulating synaptic plasticity and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2006058557,"The biological activity of macromolecules is accompanied by rapid structural changes. The photosensitivity of the carbon monoxide complex of myoglobin was used at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility to obtain pulsed, Laue x-ray diffraction data with nanosecond time resolution during the process of heme and protein relaxation after carbon monoxide photodissociation and during rebinding. These time-resolved experiments reveal the structures of myoglobin photoproducts, provide a structural foundation to spectroscopic results and molecular dynamics calculations, and demonstrate that time-resolved macromolecular crystallography can elucidate the structural bases of biochemical mechanisms on the nanosecond time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2068133180,"The current-perpendicular-to-plane magnetoresistance (CPP-MR) has been investigated for the layered manganite, La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7 (x = 0.3), which is composed of the ferromagnetic-metallic MnO2 bilayers separated by nonmagnetic insulating block layers. The CPP-MR is extremely large (10(4) percent at 50 kilo-oersted) at temperatures near above the three-dimensional ordering temperature (Tc approximately 90 kelvin) because of the field-induced coherent motion between planes of the spin-polarized electrons. Below Tc, the interplane magnetic domain boundary on the insulating block layer serves as the charge-transport barrier, but it can be removed by a low saturation field, which gives rise to the low-field tunneling MR as large as 240 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2025242397,"Overexpression of the familial Alzheimer's disease gene Presenilin 2 (PS2) in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells increased apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal or β-amyloid. Transfection of antisense PS2 conferred protection against apoptosis induced by trophic withdrawal in nerve growth factor-differentiated or amyloid precursor protein-expressing PC12 cells. The apoptotic cell death induced by PS2 protein was sensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting that heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are involved. A PS2 mutation associated with familial Alzheimer's disease was found to generate a molecule with enhanced basal apoptotic activity. This gain of function might accelerate the process of neurodegeneration that occurs in Alzheimer's disease, leading to the earlier age of onset characteristic of familial Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070068402,"Mutations in a gene encoding a multitransmembrane protein, termed presenilin 1 (PS1), are causative in the majority of early-onset cases of AD. To determine the topology of PS1, we utilized two strategies: first, we tested whether putative transmembranes are sufficient to export a protease-sensitive substrate across a lipid bilayer; and second, we examined the binding of antibodies to specific PS1 epitopes in cultured cells selectively permeabilized with the pore-forming toxin, streptolysin-O. We document that the ""loop,"" N-terminal, and C-terminal domains of PS1 are oriented toward the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2079336387,"The Hsp90 heat shock protein of eukaryotic cells regulates the activity of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and may direct intracellular protein folding in general. Hsp90 performs at least part of its function in a complex with a specific set of partner proteins that include members of the prolyl isomerase family. The properties of the major components of the Hsp90 complex were examined through the use of in vitro protein folding assays. Two of the components, FKBP52 and p23, functioned as mechanistically distinct molecular chaperones. These results suggest the existence of a super-chaperone complex in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999465079,"Molecular chaperones are essential proteins that participate in the regulation of steroid receptors in eukaryotes. The steroid aporeceptor complex contains the molecular chaperones Hsp90 and Hsp70, p48, the cyclophilin Cyp-40, and the associated proteins p23 and p60. In vitro folding assays showed that Cyp-40 and p23 functioned as molecular chaperones in a manner similar to that of Hsp90 or Hsp70. Although neither Cyp-40 nor p23 could completely refold an unfolded substrate, both proteins interacted with the substrate to maintain a nonnative folding-competent intermediate. Thus, the steroid aporeceptor complexes have multiple chaperone components that maintain substrates in an intermediate folded state."
https://openalex.org/W2008721272,"Serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to affect the development and patterning of the mouse barrelfield. We show that the dense transient 5-HT innervation of the somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices originates in the thalamus rather than in the raphe: 5-HT is detected in thalamocortical fibers and most 5-HT cortical labeling disappears after thalamic lesions. Thalamic neurons do not synthesize 5-HT but take up exogenous 5-HT through 5-HT high affinity uptake sites located on thalamocortical axons and terminals. 3H-5-HT injected into the cortex is retrogradely transported to thalamic neurons. In situ hybridization shows a transient expression of the genes encoding the serotonin transporter and the vesicular monoamine transporter in thalamic sensory neurons. In these glutamatergic neurons, internalized 5-HT might thus be stored and used as a ""borrowed transmitter"" for extraneuronal signaling or could exert an intraneuronal control on thalamic maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2091429264,INDEPTH seismic reflection profiling shows that the decollement beneath which Indian lithosphere underthrusts the Himalaya extends at least 225 kilometers north of the Himalayan deformation front to a depth of approximately 50 kilometers. Prominent reflections appear at depths of 15 to 18 kilometers near where the decollement reflector apparently terminates. These reflections extend north of the Zangbo suture to the Damxung graben of the Tibet Plateau. Some of these reflections have locally anomalous amplitudes (bright spots) and coincident negative polarities implying that they are produced by fluids in the crust. The presence of geothermal activity and high heat flow in the regions of these reflections and the tectonic setting suggest that the bright spots mark granitic magmas derived by partial melting of the tectonically thickened crust.
https://openalex.org/W2040561723,"Two genesperiod (per) and timeless (tim), are essential for circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila. The encoded proteins (PER and TIM) physically interact. Here, it is shown that TIM and PER accumulate in the cytoplasm when independently expressed in cultured (S2) Drosophila cells. However, the proteins move to the nuclei of these cells if coexpressed. Domains of PER and TIM have been identified that block nuclear localization of the monomeric proteins. In vitro protein interaction studies indicate that the sequence inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of PER forms a binding site for TIM. The results indicate a mechanism for controlled nuclear localization in which suppression of cytoplasmic localization is accomplished by direct interaction of PER and TIM. No other clock functions are required for nuclear localization. The findings suggest that a checkpoint in the circadian cycle is established by requiring cytoplasmic assembly of a PER/TIM complex as a condition for nuclear transport of either protein."
https://openalex.org/W2027937187,"The cell–cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin strongly promotes neurite outgrowth in cultured retinal neurons. To test whether cadherins regulate process outgrowth in retinal neurons in vivo, we have blocked cadherin function in single cells by expression of a dominant negative N-cadherin mutant. We report that when cadherin function is inhibited, axon and dendrite outgrowth are severely impaired, particularly in retinal ganglion cells. Laminar migration and cell type specification, by contrast, appear unaffected. Further, expression of the catenin-binding domain of N-cadherin, which blocks cadherin-mediated adhesion in early embryos, does not affect axon outgrowth, suggesting that outgrowth and adhesion are mediated by distinct regions of the cytoplasmic domain. These findings indicate that cadherins play an essential role in the initiation and extension of axons from retinal ganglion cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2099258581,"The low permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall is thought to contribute to the well known resistance of mycobacteria to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents. We have used differential scanning calorimetry to demonstrate that the high temperature phase transition observed in purified cell walls, usually in the 60-70°C range, suggestive of a lipid environment of extremely low fluidity, can also be observed in whole organisms and in cell walls from which much of the free lipids was removed by extraction with Triton X-114. A survey of seven mycobacterial species demonstrated that this high temperature transition was a general property of these organisms. Cell walls isolated from two Corynebacterium species, which contain much shorter corynemycolic acids, displayed a much lower temperature transition, suggesting that the transition temperature was directly correlated to the length of mycolic acid. Methyl esters of mycolic acids were found to have a phase transition temperature that was linearly related to the amount of trans-mycolate. Both Mycobacterium avium and M. smegmatis responded to increasing growth temperature by increasing the proportion of trans-mycolate and displaying a correspondingly higher melting temperature. Whole cells of M. smegmatis grown at higher temperature allowed a less rapid influx of two lipophilic agents, norfloxacin and chenodeoxycholate. These results provide strong evidence that the nature of mycolic acid plays a crucial role in determining the fluidity and permeability of mycobacterial cell wall."

Evidence has been provided for the efficacy of this approach in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. However, oral administration of autoantigen in mice was found to induce a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response that could lead to the onset of autoimmune diabetes. Thus, feeding autoantigen can cause autoimmunity, which suggests that caution should be used when applying this approach to the treatment of human autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2007751710,"Earthquake data collected by the INDEPTH-II Passive-Source Experiment show that there is a substantial south to north variation in the velocity structure of the crust beneath southern Tibet. North of the Zangbo suture, beneath the southern Lhasa block, a midcrustal low-velocity zone is revealed by inversion of receiver functions, Rayleigh-wave phase velocities, and modeling of the radial component of teleseismic P-waveforms. Conversely, to the south beneath the Tethyan Himalaya, no low-velocity zone was observed. The presence of the midcrustal low-velocity zone in the north implies that a partially molten layer is in the middle crust beneath the northern Yadong-Gulu rift and possibly much of southern Tibet."
https://openalex.org/W2007996847,"Cpr6 and Cpr7, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs of cyclophilin-40 (CyP-40), were shown to form complexes with Hsp90, a protein chaperone that functions in several signal transduction pathways. Deletion of CPR7 caused severe growth defects when combined with mutations that decrease the amount of Hsp90 or Sti1, another component of the Hsp90 chaperone machinery. The activities of two heterologous Hsp90-dependent signal transducers expressed in yeast, glucocorticoid receptor and pp60(v-src) kinase, were adversely affected by cpr7 null mutations. These results suggest that CyP-40 cyclophilins play a general role in Hsp90-dependent signal transduction pathways under normal growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2025912655,"We examined Period (PER) protein regulation in the brain of the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi. PER expression is restricted to the cytoplasm and axons of eight neurons, with no evidence of temporal movement into the nucleus. These neurons appear to be circadian clock cells, because PER and per mRNA are colocalized and their levels oscillate in these cells, Timeless protein immunoreactivity is coexpressed in each PER-positive neuron, and clock protein and mRNA oscillations are all suppressed in these neurons by constant light. A per antisense RNA oscillation was detected that is spatially restricted to PER-expressing cells, suggesting a novel mechanism of PER regulation. PER-positive neurons and their projections are strategically positioned for regulating prothoracicotropic hormone and eclosion hormone, two neurohormones under circadian control. Differences in the molecular details of PER expression and regulation between the brains of silkmoths and fruitflies provide insights into the mechanisms of clock gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2043279954,"Before vision, retinal ganglion cells produce spontaneous waves of action potentials. A crucial question is whether this spontaneous activity is transmitted to lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. Using a novel in vitro preparation, we report that LGN neurons receive periodic barrages of postsynaptic currents from the retina that drive them to fire bursts of action potentials. Groups of LGN neurons are highly correlated in their firing. Experiments in wild-type and NMDAR1 knockout mice show that NMDA receptor activation is not necessary for firing. The transmission of the highly correlated retinal activity to the LGN supports the hypothesis that retinal waves drive retinogeniculate synaptic remodeling. Because LGN neurons are driven to fire action potentials, this spontaneous activity could also act more centrally to influence synaptic modification within the developing visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2069300266,"Pharmacological studies support the idea that nitric oxide (NO) serves as a retrograde messenger during long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of the hippocampus. Mice with a defective form of the gene for neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), however, exhibit normal LTP. The myristoyl protein endothelial NOS (eNOS) is present in the dendrites of CA1 neurons. Recombinant adenovirus vectors containing either a truncated eNOS (a putative dominant negative) or an eNOS fused to a transmembrane protein were used to demonstrate that membrane-targeted eNOS is required for LTP. The membrane localization of eNOS may optimally position the enzyme both to respond to Ca2+ influx and to release NO into the extracellular space during LTP induction."
https://openalex.org/W2129625117,"Studies of Drosophila and other insects have indicated an essential role for the mushroom bodies in learning and memory. The leonardo gene encodes a Drosophila protein highly homologous to the vertebrate 14-3-3zeta isoform, a protein well studied for biochemical roles but without a well established biological function. The gene is expressed abundantly and preferentially in mushroom body neurons. Mutant alleles that reduce LEONARDO protein levels in the mushroom bodies significantly decrease the capacity for olfactory learning, but do not affect sensory modalities or brain neuroanatomy that are requisite for conditioning. These results establish a biological role for 14-3-3 proteins in mushroom body-mediated learning and memory processes, and suggest that proteins known to interact with them, such as RAF-1 or other protein kinases, may also have this biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2040016923,"β-Amyloid peptide is the major protein component of Alzheimer's plaques. When aggregated into amyloid fibrils, the peptide is toxic to neuronal cells. Here, an approach to the design of inhibitors of β-amyloid toxicity is described; in this strategy, a recognition element, which interacts specifically with β-amyloid, is combined with a disrupting element, which alters β-amyloid aggregation pathways. The synthesis, biophysical characterization, and biological activity of such an inhibitor is reported. This prototype inhibitor is composed of residues 15-25 of β-amyloid peptide, designed to function as the recognition element, linked to an oligolysine disrupting element. The inhibitor does not alter the apparent secondary structure of β-amyloid nor prevent its aggregation; rather, it causes changes in aggregation kinetics and higher order structural characteristics of the aggregate. Evidence for these effects includes changes in fibril morphology and a reduction in thioflavin T fluorescence. In addition to its influence on the physical properties of β-amyloid aggregates, the inhibitor completely blocks β-amyloid toxicity to PC-12 cells. Together, these data suggest that this general strategy for design of β-amyloid toxicity inhibitors is effective. Significantly, these results demonstrate that complete disruption of amyloid fibril formation is not necessary for abrogation of toxicity."

This conductive zone approaches the surface beneath the Kangmar dome (dipping north) and extends beneath the Zangbo suture. A profile crossing the northern Yadong-Gulu rift shows that the high conductivity region extends outside the rift, and its top within the rift coincides with a bright spot horizon imaged on the INDEPTH CMP (common midpoint) profiles. The high conductivity of the middle crust is atypical of stable continental regions and suggests that there is a regionally interconnected fluid phase in the crust of the region."
https://openalex.org/W1976680575,"Endocytosis and exocytosis were investigated in the synaptic terminal of retinal bipolar cells by monitoring the uptake and loss of the fluorescent dye FM1-43. Depolarization in the presence of Ca2+ stimulated a continuous cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis that was approximately balanced at rates up to 3800 vesicles per s. Vesicles became available for exocytosis within 1 min of endocytosis, and about 700,000 releasable vesicles were specifically localized to a region within 2 microm of the plasma membrane. Release of caged Ca2+ using NP-EGTA while simultaneously monitoring cytosolic Ca2+ with Fura-2 indicated that continuous exocytosis was stimulated by sub-micromolar levels of Ca2+. It has been suggested that the ribbon synapse of bipolar cells only supports transient exocytosis, but our results demonstrate that this synapse is specialized for the continuous secretion of neurotransmitter."
https://openalex.org/W1996204963,"In nematodes, flies, and mammals, dosage compensation equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes through chromosome-wide regulatory mechanisms that function in one sex to adjust the levels of X-linked transcripts.

These converted reflections are locally higher in amplitude than the corresponding P-wave reflections. Modeling of reflection mode conversion as a function of incidence angle indicates that this condition obtains for a reflector that is a solid over fluid interface; it is not typical of a solid-solid interface.

In somatic cells, DPY-26 associates specifically with hermaphrodite X chromosomes to reduce their transcript levels. In germ cells, DPY-26 associates with all meiotic chromosomes to mediate its role in chromosome segregation.

https://openalex.org/W2050050663,"In a situation so far unique among neurotransmitter receptors, glutamate receptors share amino acid sequence similarities with the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs). On the basis of the primary structure similarity of two bacterial periplasmic proteins (lysine/arginine/ornithine- and phosphate-binding proteins) with the chick cerebellar kainate-binding protein (KBP), a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, we have generated a three-dimensional model structure of the KBP extracellular domain. By an interplay between homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we have investigated the kainate binding properties of 55 different mutants (corresponding to 43 positions) and studied the interactions of some of these mutants with various glutamatergic ligands. As a result, we present here the subsets of amino acids accounting for the binding free energies and specificities of KBP for kainate, glutamate, and CNQX and propose a three-dimensional model, at the microarchitectural level, of the glutamatergic binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2129431606,"To identify new components of the Drosophila circadian clock, we screened chemically mutagenized flies for suppressors or enhancers of the long periods characteristic of the period (per) mutant allele perL. We isolated a novel mutant that maps to the rhythm gene timeless (tim). This novel allele, timSL, alters the temporal pattern of perL protein nuclear localization and restores temperature compensation to perL flies. timSL more generally manifests specific interactions with different per alleles. The identification of this first period-altering tim allele provides further evidence that TIM is a major component of the clock, and the allele-specific interactions with PER provide evidence that the PER/TIM heterodimer is a unit of circadian function. Although timSL fails to restore PER-L/TIM temperature insensitivity in yeast, it alters the TIM phosphorylation pattern during the late night. The effects on phosphorylation suggest that timSL functions as a partial bypass suppressor of perL and provide evidence that the TIM phosphorylation program contributes to the circadian timekeeping mechanism."

Recently, three pseudocatalases have been identified, shown to contain manganese (4Kono Y. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6015-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Allgood G.S.

Spectroscopic studies on the active site of the manganese catalases from the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus and from the nonthermophile Lactobacillus plantarum have shown that these two catalases have a binuclear manganese site and some accessible oxidation states of manganese atom (7Fronko R.M. Penner-Hahn J.E. Bender C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7554-7555Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Waldo G.S. Fronko R.M. Penner-Hahn J.E.

Acta. 1990; 1020: 25-33Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although a low-resolution crystal structure of the T. thermophilus catalase has been reported (11Vainshtein B.K. Melik-Adamyan W.R.

Andrianova M.E. Vainshtein B.K. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1986; 288: 877-880Google Scholar), no refined data are yet available. The L. plantarum manganese catalase, a 172-kDa protein, has a homopentameric structure that has not been found before (13Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6460-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), while the T. thermophilus enzyme is a 210-kDa homohexamer (6Barynin V.V. Grebenko A.I. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1986; 286: 461-464Google Scholar). Manganese catalases, unlike heme catalases, are stable to freezing and thawing. The interest in manganese catalases arises due not only to the considerable utilities, but to the structural specificities. The refined structures based on their amino acid sequences are yet unavailable. To assign the amino acid residues as possible ligands to the catalytic site manganese, the data of primary structures based on DNA sequences are increasingly important. In this communication, we report the gene structure of L. plantarum manganese catalase and discuss the structural properties of the enzyme. L. plantarum ATCC14431 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockvillie, MD. This organism was aerobically grown at 37°C in APT medium (BBL). All the oligonucleotides were provided by Nihon Techno Service. The nylon membrane for Southern blotting and colony screening was from Amersham (Hybond-N+). Restriction enzymes and Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells (Competent High) were purchased from Toyobo Biochemicals. Plasmid vector pUC 18 (14Yanish-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar), used here for both cloning and expression, was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (SmaI-linearized) and Toyobo Biochemicals (circular form). Catalase activity was measured using an oxygen electrode, or visualized by activity staining on gel (15Gregory E.M. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The manganese catalase from L. plantarum was purified essentially according to the previous report (4Kono Y. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6015-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme sample was examined by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidekbkilobase(s). according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside kilobase(s). Purified enzyme, electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5-20% precast gel, ATTO), was electroblotted (ATTO Hozize-Blot apparatus) onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in a Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol. The protein was stained with 0.01% Coomassie Blue, and the 28-kDa band was excised and analyzed with an Applied Biosystems 476A Protein Sequencer. For internal sequencing, 20 μg of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Sigma) was added to 40 μg of purified enzyme that had been heat-denatured (110°C, 3 min) in 125 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 1%β-mercaptoethanol, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for several hours. The resulting peptide fragments were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15% gel, ATTO) and sequenced as above. The methods used here were essentially based on those of Maniatis et al. (17Maniatis H. Fritsh E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and on the manufacturer's instructions. L. plantarum chromosomal DNA was isolated essentially according to Berns and Thomas (18Berns K.I. Thomas Jr., C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 11: 476-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and to Marmur (19Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8998) Google Scholar), and plasmids were extracted by the alkaline lysis method (17Maniatis H. Fritsh E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA extraction from agarose gel (SeaKem™ GTG Agarose, FMC) was performed with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA ligation was performed with Takara DNA Ligation Kit Version 2. PCR was carried out using Takara dNTP Mixture and Stratagene Taq Plus™ DNA Polymerase. DNA transfer onto the membrane was done by electroblotting with the same apparatus as for protein blotting described above. Protein-based oligonucleotides, together with the ECL system of 3′-oligolabeling and detection (Amersham Co.), were used for hybridization, whose chemiluminescence signal was imaged on Polaroid type 667 black and white film. DNA sequencing was performed on the ALF DNA Sequencer with the AutoCycle™ Sequencing Kit (Pharmacia). The obtained DNA sequence was compiled and analyzed using GENETYX-MAC computer programs (Software Development Co., Ltd.). The deduced amino acid sequence was compared with other protein sequences in the data base (NBRF-PDB, release 46). For expression of cloned gene in E. coli, the coding region, that was amplified from an isolated clone by PCR using gene-specific primers with added restriction sites for ligation into pUC 18, was under the control of lac promoter, so that the recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The whole proteins, including inclusion bodies, were extracted by lysing cells in 25 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.5, 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 1%β-mercaptoethanol. The rabbit antiserum raised against purified L. plantarum manganese catalase was a generous gift from Dr. A. Wadano, Dept. of Applied Biochemistry, University of Osaka Prefecture. Crude extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (5-20% gel, ATTO), transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-ECL, Amersham) as described under Microsequencing, and probed using the antiserum in combination with a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham) and a camera luminometer (ECL, Amersham). The purified enzyme preparation migrated as a single protein band on SDS-PAGE, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa (Fig. 1A), that is consistent with the previous report (4Kono Y. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6015-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. aureus V8 protease digestion of the enzyme yielded several fragments with molecular masses less than 14 kDa (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal sequences determined for the intact subunit and for one of the proteolytic fragments (Fig. 1A, indicated by the arrow), each residue of which has been assigned with no ambiguity, are shown in Fig. 1B. Oligonucleotides NS-1a, NS-1b, and NS-2 were designed on the basis of the N-terminal sequence of the intact subunit, due to its lower degeneracy for corresponding codon usage, for the molecular cloning of manganese catalase gene (Fig. 1C). L. plantarum chromosomal DNA was digested with several routinely used restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern blot analysis using three degenerate oligonucleotides described above. For each digest, NS-1b and NS-2 cross-hybridized strongly to one size of the DNA fragments, whereas NS-1a did not hybridize (data not shown). The HpaI fragments of approximately 1.5 kb were collected from agarose gel, ligated to SmaI-digested and dephosphorylated pUC 18, and transformed into E. coli JM109. Approximately 200 “white” transformants generated from this partial genomic library were screened by colony hybridization with NS-1b and NS-2, and eight positive clones were isolated. All of the positives carried 1.5-kb fragments hybridizable with NS-1b and NS-2 (data not shown). One of the positive clones was sequenced in full. The insert of the clone consisted of 1,449 base pairs. It contained an open reading frame of 798 base pairs that began with an ATG start codon and ended with a TAG stop codon (Fig. 2), encoding a polypeptide of 266 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence agreed with the N-terminal and internal sequences of L. plantarum manganese catalase that had been chemically determined (Fig. 1B). The calculated molecular mass of the encoded polypeptide was 29,743 Da, that is similar to the molecular mass of 28 kDa estimated for purified L. plantarum enzyme by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The amino acid composition calculated (data not shown) was generally in good agreement with that determined early for the purified enzyme (4Kono Y. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6015-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6460-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). There are putative promoter regions: −35, TAAACA (nucleotides 283 to 288), and −10, TATAAT (nucleotides 309 to 314), and a ribosome-binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence): GAAAGAGG (nucleotides 400 to 407), in the upstream sequence of the start codon (Fig. 2). Tandem inverted repeat sequences, that may form a stem and loop structure, were found in the 3′-noncoding region (nucleotides 1274 to 1305 and 1342 to 1371). The latter was followed by a thymine-rich sequence (Fig. 2), suggesting that this region functions as a transcriptional termination signal. Palindrome structures, potential operator sequences, were found in the 5′-noncoding region (nucleotides 360 to 369 and 384 to 397) (Fig. 2). The region from the start codon to the 3′-terminus of the cloned sequence was amplified by PCR. Primers were designed to introduce EcoRI and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the target sequence, respectively. Primer sequences were: 5′-GGAATTCCATGTTCAAACATACAAGAAAACTG-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCGAACACCATAAGCACCACCTCCAAT-3′. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment of amplified DNA was cloned into the corresponding sites of pUC 18. The resulting construct pUEMN directs the synthesis of manganese catalase under the lac promoter. The E. coli JM109 cells harboring pUEMN or pUC 18 were cultured with or without IPTG, and the induction of manganese catalase in cell-free extracts was examined. The IPTG induction in the cells harboring pUEMN caused a large increase of the protein whose band corresponded to the manganese catalase on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A, indicated by the arrow), that was recognized by the antibody to manganese catalase (Fig. 3B, indicated by the arrow). Such a protein band was invisible in the cells without the induction or in the control cells carrying pUC 18 (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the isolated gene actually encodes the manganese catalase. A computer search for proteins having homology to the manganese catalase was performed using the NBRF-PDB (release 46) data base. None of sequences homologous to this enzyme was found in the protein data base. A motif search to the manganese catalase using the PROSITE (release 13) presented no peptide sequences that may be responsible for the catalytic domain and/or the involvement in the binding of manganese ion. The sequence alignment using the GENETYX-MAC program of L. plantarum manganese catalase and E. coli manganese superoxide dismutase (20Takeda Y. Avila H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4577-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), both of which contain manganese involved in redox (4Kono Y. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6015-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Villafranca J.J. Yost Jr., F.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3532-3536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed that these two proteins are not closely related (data not shown). The manganese catalase is, if judged on the basis of its primary structure, able to be declared a novel enzyme, the catalytic domain of which may contain unknown peptide motifs. The low-resolution x-ray crystal analysis has suggested that the T. thermophilus manganese catalase has four antiparallel α-helices in which two metal ions (possibly manganese) are embedded at ∼3.6-Å distance (12Barynin V.V. Vagin A.A. Melik-Adamyan W.R. Grebenko A.I. Khangulov S.V. Popov A.N. Andrianova M.E. Vainshtein B.K. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1986; 288: 877-880Google Scholar). The L. plantarum catalase seems to have a similar structure (22Baldwin E.T. Ph.D. thesis. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill1990Google Scholar). This “4-helical bundle” structure, that usually incorporates a prosthetic group in its “hydrophobic pocket,” has also been found in myohemerythrin, a monomeric non-heme oxygen transport protein (23Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Smith J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 273-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and in other “4-α-helical proteins” (24Weber P.C. Salemme F.R. Nature. 1980; 287: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Possible α-helical regions on the deduced primary structure of L. plantarum catalase (Fig. 2) were predicted according to Chou and Fasman (25Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) and to Robson and co-workers (26Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). These predictions, although with at most 50% accuracy, suggest that the L. plantarum catalase contains a nearly parallel arrangement of α-helices as well as T. thermophilus enzyme. Sequential four helices composed of longer peptide chains and connected by shorter loop regions are represented by “helical wheels” according to Schiffer and Edmundson (27Schiffer M. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). The wheels show clusters of “hydrophobic arcs” between which are residues to be possible ligands to the manganese (28Shank M. Barynin V. Dismukes G.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15433-15436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Ivancich A. Barynin V.V. Zimmermann J.-L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6628-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar: Asp, Glu, His, Lys). This raises the possibility that the bundle formed by packing adjacent four helices is to possess an “internal hydrophobic core,” in which is fixed the dimanganese. It has actually been proposed that the catalytic site of L. plantarum catalase is not accessible by solvents, but is via a hydrophobic channel (30Penner-Hahn J.E. Pecoraro V.L. Manganese Redox Enzymes. VCH Publishers, New York1992: 29-45Google Scholar). Here, the L. plantarum catalase is proposed to form a four-helical motif between which is the catalytic site manganese. This is the first report showing a primary structure of manganese catalase based on DNA sequence. The refinement of crystal structure for the T. thermophilus catalase to assign residues as ligands to the catalytic site manganese appears to be in progress. The data presented here will assist in investigating the structural detail of these unique catalases. We thank Dr. A. Wadano for kindly providing the antiserum against the L. plantarum manganese catalase."
https://openalex.org/W1984905363,"To determine whether diffusible guidance cues direct retinal axon growth and divergence at the optic chiasm, we cocultured mouse retinal and chiasm explants in collagen gels. The chiasm reduced retinal neurite lengths and numbers, but did not affect commissural or pontine neurite growth. This reduction in growth was equal for all retinal quadrants and occurred without reorienting the direction of neurite extension. The floor plate, another midline guidance locus, also suppressed retinal neurite outgrowth, whereas cortex or cerebellum explants did not. Growth suppression was not mediated by netrin-1, which instead enhanced retinal neurite extension. We propose that chemosuppression may be a general guidance mechanism that acts in intermediate targets to prime growth cones to perceive other, more specific cues."

While the importance of [Ca2+]i in synaptic transmission is well established, a possible functional role of [Na+]i is unclear. In cultured hippocampal cells, [Na+]i was increased by veratridine. We have then measured spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and, by means of fluorescent dyes, changes in [Na+]i, in [Ca2+]i, and in the turnover of the vesicular pool of individual boutons. An elevation of [Na+]i and a concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i led to a large increase in sEPSC frequency and in the turnover of the presynaptic vesicular pool. Extracellular Ca2+ was essential for these effects of elevated [Na+]i on synaptic transmission. They probably occur via Na+/Ca2+ exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2000189503,"We examined the molecular basis of the circadian control of egg hatching behavior in the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi. Egg hatching is rhythmically gated, persists under constant darkness, and can be entrained by light by midembryogenesis. The time of appearance of photic entrainment by the silkmoth embryo coincides with the appearance of Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) proteins in eight cells in embryonic brain. Although daily rhythms in PER and/or TIM immunoreactivity in embryonic brain were not detected, a robust circadian oscillation of PER immunoreactivity is present in the nuclei of midgut epithelium. per antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment of pharate larvae on the day before hatching consistently abolishes the circadian gate of egg hatching behavior. per antisense treatment also causes a dramatic decrease in PER immunoreactivity in newly hatched larvae. The results provide direct evidence that PER is a necessary element of a circadian system in the silkmoth."

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). Many checkpoints are deregulated in oncogenesis, and, hence, negative controls on cell cycle progression may play an important role in preventing tumorigenesis. By inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase activities, CDK inhibitors can act as negative regulators of cell growth and therefore can potentially function as tumor suppressors. Two major classes of CDK inhibitors have been identified: first, p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (p21), p27KIP1, and p57KIP2 belong to a family of related CDK inhibitors that inhibits a broad range of CDK-cyclin complexes, and second, p15INK4B/MTS2, p16INK4/MTS1, p18, and p19 constitute a different family of specific inhibitors of Cdk4 and Cdk6. Hence, elucidating the regulation of CDK inhibitors and their mechanisms of braking the cell cycle may contribute to controlling cancer growth and development.The gene encoding p21 (5Xiong Y.

In addition, p21 may also play an important role in cellular transformation because it is a downstream effector of p53. p53-dependent p21 expression can be induced by ionizing radiation that triggers G1 arrest or apoptosis in cells expressing wild-type p53 (10El-Deiry W.S.

Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar).

The PKC gene family consists of 12 different isotypes, namely, α, β1, β2, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, η, θ, τ, λ, and μ, which have different tissue distribution, subcellular localization, cofactor dependence, and substrate specificities. Activation of PKC can have pleiotrophic effects on growth and tumorigenicity, depending on the cellular background in which it is expressed. This is supported by our previous observations that overexpression of PKC-β1 caused growth inhibition and tumor suppression in colon cancer cells (17Choi P.M. Tchou-Wong K.-M. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4650-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but resulted in enhanced cell growth and tumorigenicity in fibroblasts (18Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.L.W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 343-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of the same PKC-β1 gene was incompatible with growth of T leukemia cells (19Tchou-Wong K.-M. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).We are interested in investigating the p53-independent, negative growth-regulatory pathways for controlling proliferation of cancer cells because mutations in p53 are common in cancers. Hence, PKC-mediated pathways of p21 induction could represent alternative approaches for controlling aberrant growth of cancers containing p53 mutations. Although p21 has been commonly associated with the G1 checkpoint, it has been shown that during the cell cycle of normal human fibroblasts, the levels of p21 mRNA peak twice, during G1 and G2/M, which is suggestive of a potential role of p21 in G2/M (20Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the latter, addition of p21 to cycling Xenopus egg extracts resulted in a block to mitosis (21Guadagno T.M. Newport J.W. Cell. 1996; 84: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, there is also precedent for induction of G2/M arrest by overexpression of p19ARF, a gene product translated from an alternative reading frame of the p16INK4 gene (22Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 993-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that TPA-induced growth arrest in a p53-null lung cancer cell line is associated with induction of G2/M arrest and expression of a novel, faster-migrating form of p21 protein which may play a role in G2/M arrest and growth inhibition.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the mechanism of p53-independent, PKC-mediated growth arrest, the effects of TPA, a potent activator of PKC, on the growth of the Calu-1 lung carcinoma cells, which contain a homozygous deletion of the p53 gene (24Okamoto A. Hussain S.P. Hagiwara K. Spillare E.A Rusin M.R. Demetrick D.J. Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Shiseki M. Zariwala M. Xiong Y. Beach D.H. Yokota J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1448-1451PubMed Google Scholar), was studied. As shown in Fig. 1A, growth inhibition was observed when Calu-1 cells were treated with 10 nM TPA but not with a 10-fold lower dose of TPA (1 nM). We have previously shown that TPA-induced growth inhibition in PKC-β1 overexpressing colon cancer cells was also dose-dependent and was maximal at 10 nM (17Choi P.M. Tchou-Wong K.-M. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4650-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because p53-independent induction of p21 by TPA in human leukemia cells has been correlated with growth arrest (12Jiang H. Lin J. Su Z-z Collart F.R. Huberman E. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3397-3406PubMed Google Scholar, 13Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. El-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar), induction of p21 mRNA expression in TPA-treated Calu-1 cells was first examined by Northern blot analysis. Low levels of p21 mRNA were expressed in untreated cells (Fig. 1B). In a dose-dependent manner, TPA (1 nM and 10 nM) up-regulated p21 mRNA expression as early as 4 h, and maximal induction occurred at 8 h. Treatment with the noninhibitory dose of TPA (1 nM) resulted in only a transient induction of p21 mRNA expression which declined rapidly by 24 h. In contrast, sustained, higher levels of p21 mRNA were induced with 10 nM TPA which lasted for 72 h. Since growth inhibition was observed only when Calu-1 cells were treated with 10 nM TPA, it is conceivable that prolonged, high levels of p21 expression may be necessary for growth inhibition.Because induction of p21 expression has commonly been associated with G1 arrest, we examined the cell cycle distribution of TPA-treated Calu-1 cells, determined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Interestingly, despite the induction of p21 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B), no G1 arrest was observed in TPA-treated cells as compared with untreated cells, as indicated by the lack of an increase in the G1 (2N) cell population (Table I). However, treatment with 10 nM TPA, which resulted in growth inhibition, elicited a prominent, prolonged accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content in the G2/M phase beginning on day 1 and lasting for 3 days. On the other hand, consistent with the lack of growth inhibition in cells treated with the noninhibitory dose of TPA (1 nM), the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase was not observed. Hence, G2/M arrest appears to be the underlying mechanism of TPA-induced growth inhibition of Calu-1 cells.Table IEffects of TPA on cell cycle distribution of Calu-1 cellsTime in cultureCell cycleCell cycle distributionUntreatedTPA (1 nM)TPA (10 nM)%8 hG142.036.936.3S40.638.138.1G2/M17.425.125.7Day 1G146.347.641.9S30.224.011.8G2/M23.528.446.3Day 2G155.553.142.3S27.329.416.1G2/M17.217.541.7Day 3G172.363.137.3S16.823.429.7G2/M11.013.533.0 Open table in a new tab To investigate if the absence of G1 arrest was due to the lack of p21 protein expression, the latter was analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Consistent with p21 mRNA induction (Fig. 1B), a higher level of p21 protein was expressed at 8 h in cells treated with 10 nM TPA than in cells treated with 1 nM TPA (Fig. 2B). At day 1, as the level of p21 mRNA decreased in cells treated with 1 nM TPA, the corresponding level of protein also decreased. Interestingly, as G2/M arrest was induced in cells treated with 10 nM TPA at day 1 (Fig. 2A), in addition to detecting the 21-kDa protein band, an additional band with a faster electrophoretic mobility of approximately 20 kDa was also detected (Fig. 2B). After 2 days of treatment with 10 nM TPA, the upper 21-kDa band could not be detected while the faster-migrating band was prominently expressed and its level decreased at day 3. More significantly, induction of expression of this faster-migrating form of p21 protein coincided temporally with induction of G2/M arrest (compare Fig. 2A with Fig. 2B). Treatment with 1 nM TPA which did not induce growth inhibition or expression of the faster-migrating form of p21 protein also failed to induce G2/M arrest, suggesting that G2/M arrest may be mediated by the faster-migrating form of p21 protein.Fig. 2Induction of expression of a novel form of p21 protein in G2/M arrest. A, cell cycle distribution of TPA-treated Calu-1 cells was analyzed by propidium iodide staining of DNA content and flow cytometry and correlated with induction of p21 expression by 1 nM TPA (T1) or 10 nM TPA (T10) by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against p21 (6B6) (B). Induction of expression of a faster-migrating form of p21 protein correlates temporally with induction of G2/M arrest. The expression of p21 was also detected using polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal peptide (amino acids 2-21) N20 (C) and the C-terminal peptide (amino acids 146-164) C19 (D). The levels of protein expression of Cdk2 (E) and Cdc2 (F) were also analyzed by immunoblotting with the respective monoclonal antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because of the small differences in electrophoretic mobility between the two forms of p21 protein, it is conceivable that the faster-migrating protein may be the result of PKC-induced post-translational modifications or small protein truncation. Phosphorylation of serines 98 and 130 of the p21 protein has been reported to cause electrophoretic mobility shifts, and kinase-bound p21 displayed a slower electrophoretic mobility under conditions in which the cyclin A-Cdk2-p21 complex was active (25Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In contrast to kinase-bound p21 which migrated slower, TPA treatment induced a modification that resulted in a faster electrophoretic mobility of the p21 protein. Hence, to explore the alternative possibility of protein truncation as the cause of the latter, we hypothesized that a small truncation of the p21 protein could occur at the N or C terminus. To this end, we performed immunoblotting analysis using polyclonal antibodies which were raised against two peptides corresponding to amino acids 2-21 or 146-164 located in the N and C termini of the p21 protein, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2C, expression of both forms of p21 protein in Calu-1 cells treated with 10 nM TPA (day 1) was detected using antibody directed against the N-terminal peptide (N20), indicating that the N terminus was intact in both forms of p21 protein. Expression of the faster-migrating form of p21 protein detected with the N-terminal peptide antibody N20 corresponded exactly with that detected with the monoclonal antibody 6B6 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the C-terminal peptide antibody C19 only detected the upper form but failed to detect the faster-migrating form of p21 protein (Fig. 2D). Hence, induction of G2/M arrest correlates with expression of a second form of p21 protein that lacks the C-terminal epitope.At the G2/M transition, mitosis is initiated by the mitosis-promoting factor consisting of Cdc2-cyclin B complex (reviewed in Ref. 26King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The activity of Cdc2 is regulated positively by phosphorylation of Thr-161 and negatively by phosphorylation of Tyr-15 and Thr-14. At the onset of mitosis, the Cdc25 phosphatase activates mitosis-promoting factor by dephosphorylating Cdc2 on Tyr-15 and Thr-14. The addition of p21 to cycling Xenopus egg extracts which inhibited Cdk2 kinase activity resulted in blockade in mitosis and accumulation of inactive Cdc2-cyclin B. In fact, Cdk2 kinase has been shown to be required for entry into mitosis as a positive regulator of Cdc2-cyclin B kinase activity (21Guadagno T.M. Newport J.W. Cell. 1996; 84: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated a modest decrease in the protein level of Cdk2 at day 2 with 10 nM TPA treatment (Fig. 2E). On the other hand, a significant decrease in the level of Cdc2 protein expression was observed at day 2 after treatment with 10 nM but not 1 nM TPA (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, the decrease in the protein levels of Cdk2 and Cdc2 at day 2 paralleled the high level of expression of the faster-migrating p21 protein. Whether down-regulation of the protein levels of Cdc2 and Cdk2 is the cause or consequence of G2/M growth arrest remains to be determined. In addition, the exact role of the faster-migrating form of p21 protein in regulating the levels and kinase activities of Cdc2 and Cdk2 will also be investigated.To further characterize the faster-migrating p21 protein, expression of the latter in U937 leukemia cells was analyzed. Previous reports have demonstrated the induction of expression of only one form of p21 protein in the p53-null HL60 and U937 leukemia cells upon exposure to TPA (27Zhang W. Grasso L. McClain C.D. Gambel A.M. Cha Y. Travali S. Deisseroth A.B. Mercer W.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 668-674PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schwaller J. Koeffler H.P. Niklaus G. Loetscher P. Nagel S. Fey M.F. Tobler A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which caused growth arrest in the G1 phase (12Jiang H. Lin J. Su Z-z Collart F.R. Huberman E. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3397-3406PubMed Google Scholar, 13Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. El-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which form of p21 protein was expressed in leukemia cells, expression of p21 protein in TPA-treated U937 cells was evaluated alongside that in TPA-induced Calu-1 cells. In contrast to TPA-treated Calu-1 cells, only the upper form of p21 protein was expressed in TPA-treated U937 cells as detected by the monoclonal antibody 6B6 and confirmed with the N-terminal peptide antibody N20 and the C-terminal peptide antibody C19 (Fig. 3A). Treatment with a higher dose of TPA (100 nM) also resulted in the induction of only one form of p21 protein expressed. 2W.-W. Tchou, W. N. Rom, and K.-M. Tchou-Wong, unpublished observations. Cell cycle analysis confirmed that G1 arrest was induced in TPA-treated U937 cells as evident by an increase in the G1 cell population and a concomitant decrease in the S cell population at 2-3 days post-treatment (Fig. 3B). Hence, the lack of expression of the novel form of p21 protein is consistent with the absence of G2/M arrest in TPA-treated U937 cells.Fig. 3Immunoblot analysis of p21 protein expression in Calu-1 and U937 cells and cell cycle analysis of U937 cells. A, expression of p21 protein in U937 cells was compared with that in Calu-1 cells. Induction of p21 protein expression by treatment with 10 nM TPA (T10) was detected using p21-specific monoclonal antibody 6B6 and polyclonal antibodies directed against peptides corresponding to the N terminus (N20) or C terminus (C19). B, effects of TPA on cell cycle distribution of U937 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With respect to the origin of the novel form of p21 protein, the absence of a C-terminal epitope coupled with a faster electrophoretic mobility suggested that the novel p21 protein may lack the C terminus due to alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage. To evaluate the former possibility, we performed RT-PCR using primers to amplify the exon 2 coding sequence (PCR1-2) or the entire p21 coding sequence (PCR1-3) (Fig. 4A). Southern analysis of the amplified products demonstrated the induction of only a single band of the expected size in TPA-treated U937 cells which comigrated with that in Calu-1 cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, these results argued against novel splice as the cause of the faster-migrating p21 protein and suggested that the latter may be truncated at the C terminus due to proteolytic cleavage. However, direct proof of truncation of the p21 protein will require protein sequencing of the C terminus. The C terminus has previously been reported to be involved in proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding but not to be required for DNA synthesis inhibitory activity (29Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17060-17063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, the C terminus also contains two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals (6El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have shown that a C-terminal truncated protein which lacks nuclear localization signals can still inhibit DNA synthesis and translocate to the nucleus.Fig. 4Southern analysis of RT-PCR amplification of p21 cDNA.

End-labeled SQ1 was used as probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further evaluate the cell-type specificity of expression of this faster-migrating p21 protein, expression of the latter was investigated in the A549 lung carcinoma cells. Treatment of A549 cells with TPA also resulted in growth inhibition2 and expression of the faster-migrating form of p21 protein, which comigrated with that in TPA-treated Calu-1 cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast to Calu-1 cells, there was a basal level of the upper form of p21 protein expressed in untreated A549 cells which was strongly induced at 8 h with TPA treatment. Similar to that in Calu-1 cells, expression of the novel, faster-migrating form of p21 protein in A549 cells was not detected until 1 day after treatment with TPA (Fig. 5B) and coincided temporally with induction of G2/M arrest in A549 cells (Fig. 5C). These results further support the role of the novel form of p21 protein in G2/M arrest.Fig. 5Induction of expression of the novel form of p21 protein and G2/M arrest in TPA-treated A549 cells. A, TPA-induced p21 protein expression in A549 cells was compared with that in Calu-1 cells at 1 day post-treatment and detected using the monoclonal antibody 6B6. B, time course of induction of p21 protein expression in A549 cells treated with TPA. C, effects of TPA on cell cycle distribution of A549 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on these results, we hypothesized that TPA activates a PKC-mediated, negative-growth regulatory pathway leading to the induction of expression of a novel form of p21 protein which mediates G2/M arrest. Since RT-PCR and Southern analysis of cDNA from TPA-treated Calu-1 demonstrated no alternative splicing, the novel p21 protein may be modified at the protein level. Because of the faster electrophoretic mobility coupled with the lack of a C-terminal epitope recognized by peptide antibody, this novel form of p21 protein may be truncated at the C terminus as a result of PKC-mediated proteolytic cleavage. Precedents for TPA-induced proteolysis have been described. IκB-α is degraded in cells after stimulation with TPA by a chymotrypsin-like protease and coincided with activation of NF-κB (31Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). TPA-induced proteolytic cleavage has also been demonstrated for the Kit receptor (32Yee N.S. Hsiau C.W. Serve H. Vosseller K. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31991-31998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor receptors (33Bjornberg F. Lantz M. Olsson I. Gullberg U. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994; 13: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar), and the membrane-anchored precursor form of transforming growth factor-α (34Harano T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20305-20311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, down-regulation of CD43 also involves a TPA-induced protease (35Remold-O'Donnell E. Parent D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3595-3605PubMed Google Scholar). However, other forms of TPA-induced protein modifications that resulted in a faster electrophoretic mobility and the loss of the C-terminal epitope of the p21 protein cannot be ruled out and remain to be determined. Nevertheless, induction of this novel form of p21 protein may be cell type-specific because it is expressed in Calu-1 and A549 lung carcinoma cells but not in U937 leukemia cells. The cell-type specificity of induction may be due to differential expression of PKC isoforms and/or PKC substrates which awaits future investigation. Finally, experiments are in progress using site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutant p21 with similar C-terminal truncations to evaluate the role of the latter in inducing G2/M arrest. INTRODUCTIONTransitions between different cell cycle states are regulated at checkpoints controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseCdccell division cycleTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePKCprotein kinase CRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. which are activated by cyclins and inhibited by CDK inhibitors (reviewed in Refs. 1Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 2Peter M. Herskowitz I.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). Many checkpoints are deregulated in oncogenesis, and, hence, negative controls on cell cycle progression may play an important role in preventing tumorigenesis. By inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase activities, CDK inhibitors can act as negative regulators of cell growth and therefore can potentially function as tumor suppressors. Two major classes of CDK inhibitors have been identified: first, p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (p21), p27KIP1, and p57KIP2 belong to a family of related CDK inhibitors that inhibits a broad range of CDK-cyclin complexes, and second, p15INK4B/MTS2, p16INK4/MTS1, p18, and p19 constitute a different family of specific inhibitors of Cdk4 and Cdk6. Hence, elucidating the regulation of CDK inhibitors and their mechanisms of braking the cell cycle may contribute to controlling cancer growth and development.The gene encoding p21 (5Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar) was also cloned as WAF1, a p53-inducible gene (6El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), and expression of antisense p21 RNA in G0-arrested cells resulted in induction of DNA synthesis and entry into mitosis (9Nakanishi M. Adami G.R. Robetorye R.S. Noda A. Venable S.F. Dimitrov D. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, p21 may also play an important role in cellular transformation because it is a downstream effector of p53. p53-dependent p21 expression can be induced by ionizing radiation that triggers G1 arrest or apoptosis in cells expressing wild-type p53 (10El-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Wiman K.G. Mercer W.E. Kastan M.B. Kohn J.W. Elledge S.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, p21 can also be induced through p53-independent mechanisms by growth factors and the phorbol ester TPA (11Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of p21 expression by TPA in p53-null leukemia cells is also coupled to G1 arrest and differentiation (12Jiang H. Lin J. Su Z-z Collart F.R. Huberman E. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3397-3406PubMed Google Scholar, 13Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. El-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar).Protein kinase C (PKC) is the major receptor for TPA, which is widely used as a pharmacological tool to investigate PKC functions in cells (reviewed in Refs. 14Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 15Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 16Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The PKC gene family consists of 12 different isotypes, namely, α, β1, β2, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, η, θ, τ, λ, and μ, which have different tissue distribution, subcellular localization, cofactor dependence, and substrate specificities. Activation of PKC can have pleiotrophic effects on growth and tumorigenicity, depending on the cellular background in which it is expressed. This is supported by our previous observations that overexpression of PKC-β1 caused growth inhibition and tumor suppression in colon cancer cells (17Choi P.M. Tchou-Wong K.-M. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4650-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but resulted in enhanced cell growth and tumorigenicity in fibroblasts (18Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.L.W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 343-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of the same PKC-β1 gene was incompatible with growth of T leukemia cells (19Tchou-Wong K.-M. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell.

Hence, PKC-mediated pathways of p21 induction could represent alternative approaches for controlling aberrant growth of cancers containing p53 mutations. Although p21 has been commonly associated with the G1 checkpoint, it has been shown that during the cell cycle of normal human fibroblasts, the levels of p21 mRNA peak twice, during G1 and G2/M, which is suggestive of a potential role of p21 in G2/M (20Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the latter, addition of p21 to cycling Xenopus egg extracts resulted in a block to mitosis (21Guadagno T.M. Newport J.W. Cell. 1996; 84: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, there is also precedent for induction of G2/M arrest by overexpression of p19ARF, a gene product translated from an alternative reading frame of the p16INK4 gene (22Quelle D.E. Zindy F.

In this report, we demonstrate that TPA-induced growth arrest in a p53-null lung cancer cell line is associated with induction of G2/M arrest and expression of a novel, faster-migrating form of p21 protein which may play a role in G2/M arrest and growth inhibition."

Also, a PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase which forms a complex with p85/p110 PI 3-kinase in platelets has been described (32Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Matizaris M. Brown S. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The combination of actions of this stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and 5′-phosphatase activity is expected to produce cellular PI 3,4-P2 which may be uniquely important in triggering downstream cellular effects. These considerations prompted us to investigate whether insulin action might also modulate polyphosphoinositide 5′-phosphatase activity. We report here a marked insulin-mediated recruitment of 5′-phosphatase activity specific for PI 3,4,5-P3 to complexes containing Shc and Grb2. This novel action of insulin is likely to play an important role in one or more downstream cascades important to this hormone's function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInitial experiments were conducted to establish assay conditions for quantifying polyphosphoinositide 5′-phosphatase activity in lysates of CHO-T cells expressing human insulin receptors. Dephosphorylation of [3′-32P]PI 3,4,5-P3 to di- and monophosphoinositides in cell lysates was readily observed in the absence of vanadate upon thin layer chromatography analysis of the reaction products (not shown). However, inclusion of vanadate in the assay buffer almost completely blocked PI 3,4-P2 phosphatase activity with little effect on the PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity. This is consistent with a previous report that 3′-phosphatase is inhibited by vanadate (27Lips D.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19911-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of vanadate, nearly quantitative conversion of PI 3,4,5-P3 to PI 3,4-P2 was observed, measured either as the disappearance of the former or appearance of the latter (not shown). All subsequent assays were therefore performed under these conditions.To determine whether insulin regulates PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase, lysates of CHO-T cells incubated with or without insulin were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) antibody, and the precipitates were assayed as described above. The results revealed a marked increase in PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity in the anti-Tyr(P) precipitates due to insulin action (Fig. 1, A and B). Tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor and IRS-1 were immunoprecipitated when cells were treated with insulin under these conditions, as evidenced by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). However, when either insulin receptors or IRS-1 were specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor or anti-IRS-1 antibody (Fig. 1C), no insulin-stimulated PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity could be detected in the immune complexes (Fig. 1, A and B). This was also the case when whole cell lysates from control versus insulin-treated CHO-T cells were assayed (data not shown).The insulin-regulated PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity present in the anti-tyrosine phosphate immunoprecipitates was dependent on MgCl2 in the assay buffer (data not shown). The anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates did not contain insulin-regulated phosphatase activity when PI 4,5-P2 was used as substrate (data not shown). High pressure liquid chromatography of the deacylated 32P-labeled phosphoinositide reaction products was performed to identify the diphosphoinositide formed in the presence of tyrosine phosphate immune complexes from control and insulin-treated CHO-T cells (Fig. 2). This analysis demonstrated virtually quantitative conversion of PI 3,4,5-P3 to PI 3,4-P2 in this assay as well as a marked increase in PI 3,4-P2 formation catalyzed by the immune complexes derived from insulin-treated cells (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Insulin-regulated PI 3,4,5-P3 phosphatase dephosphorylates PI 3,4,5-P3 at the 5′-position of the inositol ring. Lysates from CHO-T cells treated with or without insulin (control) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P), and PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity was assayed as described in Fig. 1.

Immune complexes obtained from lysates of insulin-treated CHO-T cells using anti-Shc or anti-Grb2 antibodies exhibited PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity that was severalfold higher than that derived from control cells. However, the insulin-stimulated 5′-phosphatase activity in the anti-Shc and anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates was about half that associated with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig. 3). This probably reflects, at least in part, the fact that the anti-Shc and anti-Grb2 antibodies used do not quantitatively precipitate Shc and Grb2 from the cell lysates (data not shown). Taken together, the data in Figs. 1, 2, 3 demonstrate a marked effect of insulin to cause association of Shc and Grb2 with one or more 5′-phosphatases able to dephosphorylate PI 3,4,5-P3 but not PI 4,5-P2.Fig. 3Insulin increases association of PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity with Shc and Grb2.

CHO-T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHIP antibody, and both the precipitate and supernatant were assayed for PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 4, only the latter catalyzed formation of labeled PI 3,4-P2 in this assay. Parallel immunoprecipitations of hamster lung lysates with anti-SHIP revealed easily detectable PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase in the precipitates as well as in the supernatants (Fig. 4). Similarly, the anti-SHIP precipitates from hamster lung displayed a 150-kDa band upon SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting that was not present in anti-Tyr(P) imunoprecipitates of insulin-treated CHO-T cells lysates (data not shown). These latter immune complexes exhibited significant PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity as demonstrated in Figs. 1, 2, 3. Thus, these data indicate that the insulin-regulated polyphosphoinositide 5′-phosphatase is not SHIP itself. However, it is possible that the CHO-T cell 5′-phosphatase is an isoform of this enzyme that is not recognized by anti-SHIP antibody. Resolving the identity of the presently described insulin-regulated PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase is an important future objective.Fig. 4The insulin-regulated PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase is not reactive with anti-SHIP. Lysates were prepared from CHO-T cell or hamster lung tissue. A, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHIP antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity as described. NA indicates no addition, and Sup indicates supernatant after immunoprecipitation. B, graph shows PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase in anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates and supernatant (Sup.) from immunoprecipitates from CHO-T cell or hamster lung lysates.

Phosphorylation of this 3′-position is catalyzed by four known classes of PI 3-kinases that exhibit diverse regulatory mechanisms (16Kapeller R. Cantley L. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 36Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Thus, the regulated phosphorylation of PI 4,5-P2 by PI 3-kinases theoretically provides substrate for the 5′-phosphatases specific for PI 3,4,5-P3. These two reactions catalyzed by PI 3-kinase and PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase in combination promote the conversion of PI 4,5-P2 to PI 3,4-P2. The fact that insulin and other growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases regulate both of these enzymes indicates that at least part of the cellular PI 3,4-P2 generated in response to these signaling pathways derives from newly formed PI 3,4,5-P3. Further, these considerations strongly suggest an important role for PI 3,4-P2 in signaling by these receptors. PI 3,4-P2 may be an effector that is unique and specific for one or more downstream signaling pathways such as the cAkt/Rac protein kinase (40Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). Thus, the PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase reaction may serve as a branch point for polyphosphoinositide signaling in which PI 3,4,5-P3 activates a set of events distinct from those activated by PI 3,4-P2. It will be important to search for cellular proteins that specifically bind each of these phosphoinositides.The association of 5′-phosphatase with Shc and Grb2 in response to insulin reported here (Fig. 3) suggests a potential role of this phosphatase in regulating the p21ras pathway. Both Shc and Grb2 are components of multiprotein complexes containing the guanine nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless that catalyzes GTP loading of p21ras (8Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G.

Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and in some cell types a downstream effect of p21ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, in response to insulin or growth factors is blocked by wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinases (44Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Futher studies on this issue are clearly warranted.In addition to a potential positive signaling function of the insulin-sensitive PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase described above, a negative role in signal transmission is also possible. If PI 3,4,5-P3 generated by PI 3-kinases is a positive effector of downstream signaling events, as appears likely (16Kapeller R. Cantley L. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), its concentration is expected to be reduced by the action of the 5′-phosphatase. Thus, the signaling potential of PI 3,4,5-P3 may be reduced or desensitized by insulin-regulated PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase. Perhaps it is desirable to control the cellular localization of PI 3,4,5-P3 and to restrict it from regions containing Shc·Grb2 complexes. This hypothesis requires rigorous testing subsequent to identification of additional cellular targets of PI 3,4,5-P3. In any case, the data reported here indicate an important function of PI 3,4,5-P3 5′-phosphatase activity in one or more signaling pathways emanating from the insulin receptor. INTRODUCTIONThe insulin receptor belongs to a family of structurally related transmembrane growth factor receptors that exhibit ligand-activated protein-tyrosine kinase activity (1White M.F.

Lipid second messenger production is a complex process involving a variety of regulatory enzymes that control the intracellular response to the extracellular signal. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is generated in response to phospholipase D and can be converted to other lipid second messengers including diacylglycerol (DG) and lysophosphatidic acid. PA is converted to DG by PA phosphohydrolase (PAP). We report here that PAP activity can be detected in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor immunoprecipitates. Following treatment with EGF, there is a substantial reduction in the PAP activity that co-precipitates with the EGF receptor. The loss of EGF receptor-associated PAP activity occurs with a concomitant increase in PAP activity associated with the ϵ isoform of protein kinase C (PKC). The PAP activity associated with PKCϵ was dependent upon the PKC co-factors phosphatidylserine and DG but was independent of the kinase activity of PKCϵ. These data suggest a novel signaling mechanism for the regulation of lipid second messenger production and implicate PAP as an important regulatory component for lipid second messenger production in receptor-mediated intracellular signaling.

These data suggest a novel signaling mechanism for the regulation of lipid second messenger production and implicate PAP as an important regulatory component for lipid second messenger production in receptor-mediated intracellular signaling. One of the earliest responses to extracellular signals is the metabolic conversion of membrane phospholipids into intracellular second messengers (1Foster D.A. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Foster D.A. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The best studied second messenger-generating system is the activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), 1The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CDGdiacylglycerolEGFepidermal growth factorNEMN-ethylmaleimidePAphosphatidic acidPAPphosphatidic acid phosphohydrolasePCphosphatidylcholinePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePKCprotein kinase CPLDphospholipase DPSphosphatidylserine. which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diglyceride (DG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (3Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for generating DG is through the activation of type D phospholipases (PLD) that catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline (4Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). PA can be converted to DG by a PA phosphohydrolase (PAP). Regulation of PAP is likely to be important because PA can be converted to biologically active molecules other than DG. Lyso-PA can be generated from PA and has been shown to mediate several biological activities (5Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

PA has been reported to enhance ARF-GTPase-activating protein, which inactivates the Ras superfamily GTPase ARF (8Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to be a co-factor for the activation of PLD (9Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.

Science. 1990; 250: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and Ras has also been implicated in the activation of PLD (13Carnero A. Cuadrado A. del Peso L. Lacal J.C.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7207-7210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to the production of PIP2, the substrate for PLCγ and a co-factor for PLD (9Brown H.A. Gutowski S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Another suspected role for PA is in facilitating both membrane fusion and vesicular transport (8Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, control of cellular PA levels is likely to be important for the control of responses to extracellular stimuli mediated by phospholipid metabolism. phospholipase C diacylglycerol epidermal growth factor N-ethylmaleimide phosphatidic acid phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate protein kinase C phospholipase D phosphatidylserine. We previously demonstrated that EGF induces an increase in DG that was generated from PC-derived PA (17Song J. Jiang Y.-W. Foster D.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PAP. In this report, we describe a novel mechanism for regulation of lipid second messenger production in response to EGF. A431 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were routinely placed in serum-free medium prior to treatment with EGF to reduce background PAP activity. [3H]PA was obtained from New England Nuclear. PIP2, PC, phosphatidylserine (PS), DG were obtained from Sigma. The anti-EGF receptor antibody was obtained from Oncogene Science; antibodies specific for the α, ϵ, and ζ PKC isoforms were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. A431 cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm culture dishes and then placed in serum-free medium overnight as described previously (17Song J. Jiang Y.-W. Foster D.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar). The cells are then washed in cold isotonic buffer, scraped from the plates, and suspended in 2 ml of hypotonic buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3; 5 mM NaCl; 5 mM Na2HPO4; 1 μM ZnCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml leupeptin; 1 μg/ml aprotinin; 400 μM Na4VaO4). The suspended cells were then broken by Dounce homogination (15 strokes with type B pestle). Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to clear nuclei and unbroken cells. The post-nuclear homogenate was used as the whole cell lysate. The post-nuclear homogenate can be separated into membrane and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernantent is saved as the cytosolic fraction. The membrane fraction is recovered from the pellet by resuspending in buffer A. Liposomes are made by mixing lipids in chloroform, drying under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspending in assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 5 mM Na2HPO4, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2) with vortexing and then sonicating for 3 min. Unless otherwise indicated, the liposome suspension was 5 μg/ml dipalmitoyl-PA (∼0.1 mol fraction), 10 μg/ml PC (from egg yolk), 10 μg/ml PIP2, 30 μg/ml PS, 3 μg/ml DG (Sigma), and 20,000 cpm [14C]dipalmitoyl-PA (100 Ci/mmol). The sonicated solution is kept at room temperature for 2 h to equilibrate. The PAP assay is initiated by the addition of 20 μl of homogenate (40 μg of protein) to prewarmed (37°C) liposome suspension. Where appropriate, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was added to maintain constant protein concentration (1 mg/ml) in the reaction mixture. The final volume of the reaction mixture was 140 μl. The mixture is incubated at 37°C for 15 min unless otherwise indicated. The reaction consumed less than 20% of the [14C]PA. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 800 μl of chloroform/methanol (6:2 v/v). DG is resolved by thin layer chromatography as described previously (18Jiang Y.-W. Song J. Zang Q. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). membrane fractions were treated with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 140 mM NaCl. Insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 30 min). The 1 ml of supernatant (1 mg of protein) was then incubated with the indicated antibody (2 μg) overnight at 4°C with shaking. The antigen-antibody complexes were then recovered with 20 μl of either protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose suspensions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (2 h, 4°C with shaking) by microcentrifugation and washing four times in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 140 mM NaCl. Liposome suspensions were then added to the immunoprecipitates, and PAP activity was determined as described above. There are currently no direct assays for PAP activity in intact cells. However, PAP activity can be measured in vitro by adding cell extracts or lysates containing PAP to liposomes containing radiolabeled PA and examining the conversion of PA to DG. An in vitro PAP assay based on strategies developed by Brindley and co-workers (19Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Waggoner D.W. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23924-23932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to investigate PAP activity in A431 cells. In A431 cells PAP activity could be detected in both cytosolic and membrane fractions (Table I). It has been reported that in several different cell types, two distinct PAP activities exist that can be distinguished on the basis of a differential sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and Mg2+ (19Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Waggoner D.W. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

In A431 cells, we found that virtually all of the PAP activity, both membrane and cytosolic, was sensitive to NEM (Table I). This difference was not likely due to differences in experimental protocol, because we also find that in 3Y1 rat fibroblasts 80% of the PAP activity was resistant to NEM treatment (data not shown). NEM-resistant PAP was reported to be insensitive to Mg2+, whereas the NEM-sensitive PAP activity was stimulated by Mg2+ (19Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the NEM-sensitive PAP activity from both membranes and cytosol was dependent upon Mg2+. Thus, we were unable to detect significant biochemical differences between the membrane and cytosolic PAP activities in A431 cells. These properties are characteristic of the PAP previously designated PAP1 (19Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the PAP activity was sensitive to the amphiphilic cations propranolol, chlorpromazine, and sphingosine, which have been shown previously to inhibit PAP activity (19Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPAP activity in A431 cellsPAP activity ([14C]DG)MembraneCytosolcpm/mg protein × 10−3Liposomes only0.05 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.01Complete2.78 ± 0.09 (1.00)0.84 ± 0.12 (1.00)− Mg2+0.10 ± 0.01 (0.04)0.13 ± 0.09 (0.15)− Ca2+2.74 ± 0.13 (0.99)0.96 ± 0.07 (1.14)+ NEM0.05 ± 0.01 (0.02)0.03 ± 0.01 (0.04)Heat0.23 ± 0.08 (0.08)0.14 ± 0.04 (0.16)+ Propranolol0.51 ± 0.23 (0.18)ND+ Sphingosine0.05 ± 0.01 (0.02)ND+ Chlorpromazine0.11 ± 0.02 (0.04)ND Open table in a new tab Liposome composition can also affect in vitro PAP activity (19Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of the phospholipid composition of the liposomes used in the PAP assay. As shown in Table II, PAP activity was stimulated by the inclusion of PIP2, although PAP activity was not dependent upon PIP2 as demonstrated for PLD (9Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 16Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PIP2 is a substrate for PLCγ, and it has been reported that PA can stimulate PLCγ activity (22Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PA stimulation of PLCγ activity was dependent upon Ca2+ (22Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, as shown in Table I, Ca2+ had no effect upon the PAP activity in the presence of PIP2. As shown in Table II, the addition of DG (the product of PLCγ) to the liposomes actually inhibited the PAP activity in the presence of PIP2. Thus, the effect of PIP2 is not likely due to an effect of PLCγ on PAP activity. The addition of PS and DG was also stimulatory for PAP activity (Table II). The effect of PS and DG, which are co-factors for PKC activity, suggested the possible PKC involvement in PAP activity. The effect of EGF on the PAP activity from A431 cells was examined, and although EGF reproducibly elevated PAP activity, the effect varied with the composition of the liposomes (Table II).Table IIEffect of liposome composition and EGF on PAP Activity from A431 CellsLiposome compositionPAP activity ([14C]DG)−EGF+EGFcpm/mg protein × 10−3PA only1.07 ± 0.17 (1.0)1.59 ± 0.10 (1.5)PA + PC1.18 ± 0.10 (1.1)1.72 ± 0.12 (1.6)PA + PC + PIP23.40 ± 0.15 (3.2)5.62 ± 0.24 (5.3)PA + PC + PIP2+ DG2.13 ± 0.14 (2.0)5.76 ± 0.33 (5.4)PA + PC + PIP2+ PS4.13 ± 0.30 (3.9)6.15 ± 0.46 (5.8)PA + PC + PIP2+ PS + DG5.28 ± 0.36 (4.9)6.57 ± 0.40 (6.1) Open table in a new tab The EGF receptor has previously been demonstrated to be in complexes with molecules that transduce intracellular signals (1Foster D.A.

Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PAP activity could be detected in EGF receptor immunoprecipitates. Membranes were isolated from EGF-treated A431 cells and untreated controls. Detergent lysates of the membrane fractions were treated with antibodies raised against the EGF receptor. Immunoprecipitates were recovered, and PAP activity was examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, PAP activity could be easily detected in the EGF receptor immunoprecipitates. However, in contrast to expectations, activity was lost upon EGF treatment (Fig. 1A). The loss of PAP activity associated with the EGF receptor in response to EGF was both time- (Fig. 1A) and dose-dependent (Fig. 1B) with the loss in activity being detectable within 1 min and at 1 nM EGF. This reduction in PAP activity was not due to a reduced ability of the antibody to precipitate EGF-treated receptor, because there were no differences in the amount of EGF receptor precipitated from the EGF-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 1C). This suggested that either the PAP activity was reduced or that PAP protein was released from the receptor in response to EGF. Because we could detect overall increases in total PAP activity in response to EGF, we considered the first possibility unlikely. Thus, the data in Fig. 1 suggest that the PAP associated with the EGF receptor is released in response to EGF treatment. In Table II it was shown that PAP activity was enhanced by the presence of PS and DG in the liposomes. This suggested an involvement of PKC. Jaken and co-workers have characterized a number of proteins that interact directly with PKC isoforms (25Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that PAP activity could be associated with PKC isoforms present in A431 cells. The predominant PKC isoforms present in A431 cells are the α, ϵ, and ζ isoforms. 2Y. Jiang, Z. Lu, Q. Zang, and D. A. Foster, our unpublished results. PAP activity in PKC isoform immunoprecipitates from lysates of A431 cells that had been either treated or untreated with EGF was determined. As shown in Fig. 2A, a very strong EGF-dependent PAP activity was detected in PKCϵ but not PKCα or ζ immunoprecipitates. The lack of PAP in the PKCα and ζ immunoprecipitates was not due to an inability to precipitate PKCα and ζ because these isoforms could be detected at levels comparable with the ϵ isoform in the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). A PKCϵ peptide against which the antibody was raised prevented precipitation of PAP with the PKCϵ antibody (Fig. 2A). The kinetics of association of PAP with PKCϵ was just slightly behind the EGF-induced dissociation of PAP from the EGF receptor (Fig. 2B). The in vitro PAP activity from A431 cells was significantly enhanced when PS and DG were included in the liposomes used in the PAP assay (Table II). We therefore examined the effect of DG and PS in the liposomes when the PKCϵ-associated PAP activity was determined. In the absence of DG and PS, we were unable to detect any PAP activity in the PKCϵ immunprecipitates in response to EGF (Fig. 3). The DG and PS requirement suggested that PKCϵ activity is important in the in vitro liposome assay. However, as shown in Fig. 3, neither ATP nor ATPγS had any effect on the PAP activity associated with PKCϵ, suggesting that the kinase activity is not required. Consistent with this result, staurosporine, which inhibits PKC by competing for ATP binding, also had no effect upon the in vitro PAP activity in the PKCϵ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B). These surprising results suggest that although the PKC co-factors DG and PS are required to observe the PAP activity associated with PKCϵ, the kinase activity of PKCϵ is apparently not required for the in vitro PAP activity. In this report, data have been presented suggesting a novel signaling mechanism in which PAP associated with the EGF receptor becomes associated with PKCϵ. Upon EGF treatment, PLCγ is activated (26Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzski A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1101-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The generation of DG by PLCγ could lead to the observed increase in membrane localization of PKCϵ in response to EGF. PAP could then become associated with membrane-bound PKCϵ. Although the data presented here do not demonstrate that PAP activity is actually elevated in response to EGF, the kinetics of the EGF-induced association of PAP with PKCϵ correlate well with the EGF-induced increase in PC-derived DG reported previously (17Song J. Jiang Y.-W. Foster D.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that there are no significant changes in the specific activity of PAP in response to EGF and that regulation is accomplished by the induced change in the association of PAP from the EGF receptor to an association PKCϵ. We were unable to detect PAP activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates,2 suggesting that the PAP is not a direct substrate of the EGF receptor. Thus, a molecular mechanism for the putative dissociation of PAP from the EGF receptor and association with PKCϵ remains to be determined. The requirement for PS and DG in order to see the PKCϵ-associated PAP activity suggested a requirement for PKC activity. However, because ATP, ATPγS, nor the ATP analog staurosporine had any effect on the PKCϵ-associated PAP activity, it is possible that the PS and DG are functioning to localize PKCϵ and the associated PAP to the liposomes where the PA substrate is present. In this regard, it is of interest that PKC has been shown to stimulate PLD activity via an ATP-independent mechanism (27Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These observations, along with data presented here, suggest that PKC(s) may have kinase-independent roles in the regulation of intracellular signals. It is possible that PKCϵ may serve to either allosterically modify PAP or to localize PAP to appropriate membrane locations where PA substrate is localized. PKC could be important for positioning PAP in a molecular complex where the enzyme functions as a component of a signaling complex that generates DG, which activates the associated PKC, which would then phosphorylate other substrates.

To determine the source of SPAI, we carried out in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry using an antisense cRNA probe and an antiserum against recombinant SPAI, respectively. Since previous RNase protection analysis had indicated that SPAI mRNA is almost exclusively expressed in the porcine small intestine, we used its frozen sections for the staining. The lower crypt was decorated with both the cRNA probe and antiserum, indicating that SPAI is synthesized and secreted by the enteroendocrine cells located near the crypt base. The native form of SPAI was also characterized by Western blotting. This result together with the previous biochemical and molecular biological characterizations may set the stage for identifying the physiological roles of the conceptually very interesting protein SPAI."

In addition to the traditional minireviews the Journal has been publishing for 8 years, we are instituting some thematic minireview series, with several related minireviews appearing in successive issues of the Journal. The first minireview series was focused on myosin and appeared in 7. This issue begins a series of five minireviews on the mechanisms of protein translocation across membranes. The series focuses on a major strategic problem encountered by prokaryotes and eukaryotes. While it is advantageous to sequester cellular and organellar contents within membranous compartments, it is necessary to transport proteins back and forth across those membranes. The mecha-nisms that have been elucidated for transport of a polypeptide across a lipid bilayer are being elucidated in a number of systems. This minireview series describes those mechanisms for mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, chloroplasts, and Escherichia coli. The reviews are: “Escherichia coli Preprotein Translocase” by William Wickner and Marilyn Rice Leonard, “Mechanism of Polypeptide Translocation into the Endoplasmic Reticulum” by Ann K. Corsi and Randy Schekman, “Protein Translocation at the Envelope and Thylakoid Membranes of Chloroplasts” by Andrei Kouranov and Danny J. Schnell, “The Protein Import System of Mitochondria” by Gottfried Schatz, and “Protein Translocation into Peroxisomes” by Suresh Subramani."
