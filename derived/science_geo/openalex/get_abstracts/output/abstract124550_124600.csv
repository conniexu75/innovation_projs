https://openalex.org/W2072569792,"NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably transformed with a constitutively active isoform of p21 Ras , H-Ras V12 (v-H-Ras or EJ-Ras), produced large amounts of the reactive oxygen species superoxide (·O 2 − ). ·O 2 − production was suppressed by the expression of dominant negative isoforms of Ras or Rac1, as well as by treatment with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor or with diphenylene iodonium, a flavoprotein inhibitor. The mitogenic activity of cells expressing H-Ras V12 was inhibited by treatment with the chemical antioxidant N -acetyl-L-cysteine. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity was decreased and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was not activated in H-Ras V12 -transformed cells. Thus, H-Ras V12 -induced transformation can lead to the production of ·O 2 − through one or more pathways involving a flavoprotein and Rac1. The implication of a reactive oxygen species, probably ·O 2 − , as a mediator of Ras-induced cell cycle progression independent of MAPK and JNK suggests a possible mechanism for the effects of antioxidants against Ras-induced cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2012851706,"High levels of familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)-linked SOD1 mutants G93A and G37R were previously shown to mediate disease in mice through an acquired toxic property. We report here that even low levels of another mutant, G85R, cause motor neuron disease characterized by an extremely rapid clinical progression, without changes in SOD1 activity. Initial indicators of disease are astrocytic inclusions that stain intensely with SOD1 antibodies and ubiquitin and SOD1-containing aggregates in motor neurons, features common with some cases of SOD1 mutant- mediated ALS. Astrocytic inclusions escalate markedly as disease progresses, concomitant with a decrease in the glial glutamate transporter (GLT-1). Thus, the G85R SOD1 mutant mediates direct damage to astrocytes, which may promote the nearly synchronous degeneration of motor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2158126393,"During development, activity-dependent mechanisms are thought to contribute to the refinement of topographical projections from the thalamus to the cortex. Because activity-dependent increases in synaptic strength may contribute to the stabilization of synaptic connections, we have explored the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at thalamocortical synapses in rat somatosensory (barrel) cortex. During early postnatal development (postnatal days 2-5), we find that a significant proportion of thalamocortical synapses are functionally silent and that these are converted to functional synapses during LTP. Silent synapses disappear by postnatal day 8-9, the exact time at which the susceptibility of these synapses to LTP is lost. These findings suggest that the activity-dependent conversion of silent to functional synapses due to correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity may contribute to the early development and refinement of thalamocortical inputs to cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2071397057,"In Xenopus laevis embryos, the Wingless/Wnt-1 subclass of Wnt molecules induces axis duplication, whereas the Wnt-5A subclass does not. This difference could be explained by distinct signal transduction pathways or by a lack of one or more Wnt-5A receptors during axis formation. Wnt-5A induced axis duplication and an ectopic Spemann organizer in the presence of hFz5, a member of the Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane receptors. Wnt-5A/hFz5 signaling was antagonized by glycogen synthase kinase-3 and by the amino-terminal ectodomain of hFz5. These results identify hFz5 as a receptor for Wnt-5A."
https://openalex.org/W1975700762,"The organization of calcium (Ca 2+ ) stores in the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (S-ER) is poorly understood. The dynamics of the storage and release of calcium in the S-ER of intact, cultured astrocytes and arterial myocytes were studied with high-resolution imaging methods. The S-ER appeared to be a continuous tubular network; nevertheless, calcium stores in the S-ER were organized into small, spatially distinct compartments that functioned as discrete units. Cyclopiazonic acid (an inhibitor of the calcium pump in the S-ER membrane) and caffeine or ryanodine unloaded different, spatially separate compartments. Heterogeneity of calcium stores was also revealed in cells activated by physiological agonists. These results suggest that cells can generate spatially and temporally distinct calcium signals to control individual calcium-dependent processes."

https://openalex.org/W1975888261,"At excitatory synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, a larger quantal content is sensed by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) than by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). A novel explanation for this discrepancy is that glutamate released from terminals presynaptic to one cell can diffuse to and activate NMDARs, but not AMPARs, on a neighboring cell. If this occurs in the living brain, it could invalidate the view that glutamatergic synapses function as private communication channels between neurons. Here, we show that the discrepancy in quantal content mediated by the two receptors is greatly decreased at physiological temperature, compared with conventional recording conditions. This effect of temperature is not due to changes in release probability or uncovering of latent AMPARs. It is, however, partially reversed by the glutamate uptake inhibitor dihydrokainate. The results suggest that glutamate transporters play a critical role in limiting the extrasynaptic diffusion of glutamate, thereby minimizing cross-talk between neighboring excitatory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2088115551,"We asked whether GABA(A) and NMDA receptors may act in synergy in neonatal hippocampal slices, at a time when GABA exerts a depolarizing action. The GABA(A) receptor agonist isoguvacine reduced the voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of single NMDA channels recorded in cell-attached configuration from P(2-5) CA3 pyramidal neurons and potentiated the Ca2+ influx through NMDA channels. The synaptic response evoked by electrical stimulation of stratum radiatum was mediated by a synergistic interaction between GABA(A) and NMDA receptors. Network-driven Giant Depolarizing Potentials, which are a typical feature of the neonatal hippocampal network, provided coactivation of GABA(A) and NMDA receptors and were associated with spontaneous and synchronous Ca2+ increases in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Thus, at the early stages of development, GABA is a major excitatory transmitter that acts in synergy with NMDA receptors. This provides in neonatal neurons a hebbian stimulation that may be involved in neuronal plasticity and network formation in the developing hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2042482088,"Axonal pathfinding in the nervous system is mediated in part by cell-to-cell signaling events involving members of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and their membrane-bound ligands. Genetic evidence suggests that transmembrane ligands may transduce signals in the developing embryo. The cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane ligand Lerk2 became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after contact with the Nuk/Cek5 receptor ectodomain, which suggests that Lerk2 has receptorlike intrinsic signaling potential. Moreover, Lerk2 is an in vivo substrate for the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, which suggests crosstalk between Lerk2 signaling and signaling cascades activated by tyrosine kinases. It is proposed that transmembrane ligands of Eph receptors act not only as conventional RTK ligands but also as receptorlike signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1965389461,"The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) NCAM, N-cadherin, and L1 are homophilic binding molecules that stimulate axonal growth. We have postulated that the above CAMs can stimulate this response by activating the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in neurons. In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of NCAM and L1 can lead to phosphorylation of the FGFR. Both this and the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by all three of the above CAMs are lost when a kinase-deleted, dominant negative form of FGFR1 is expressed in PC12 cells. In addition, we have generated transgenic mice that express the dominant negative FGFR under control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. We show that cerebellar neurons isolated from these mice have also lost their ability to respond to NCAM, N-cadherin, and L1. A peptide inhibitor of phospholipase C gamma (PLCgamma) that inhibits neurite outgrowth stimulated by FGF also inhibited neurite outgrowth stimulated by the CAMs. Thus, we conclude that activation of the FGFR is both necessary and sufficient to account for the ability of the above CAMs to stimulate axonal growth, and that PLCgamma is a key downstream effector of this response."
https://openalex.org/W2021252415,"Our previous data indicate that the expression of the PLK gene which codes for a serine/threonine kinase is restricted to proliferating cells. In Northern blot experiments PLK mRNA expression was at the limit of detection in normal lung tissue but elevated in most samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A very low frequency of PLK transcripts was only found in bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas. NSCLC patients whose tumors showed moderate PLK expression survived significantly longer (5 year survival rate=51.8%) than those with high levels of PLK transcripts (24.2%, P=0.001). No statistically significant correlation was found between PLK mRNA expression and age, sex, TNM status, histological type or degree of differentiation. Interestingly, the prognosis of patients in post-surgical stages I and II was correlated with PLK expression (5 year survival rates in stage I: 69.1% (moderate PLK) – 43.5% (high PLK), P=0.03 or in stage II: 51.9% (moderate PLK) – 9.9% (high PLK), P=0.006). These results suggest that PLK mRNA expression provides a new independent prognostic indicator for patients with NSCLC."

https://openalex.org/W2065009470,"In this report, we have examined the role of neuron-derived BDNF at an accessible synapse, that of preganglionic neurons onto their sympathetic neuron targets. Developing and mature sympathetic neurons synthesize BDNF, and preganglionic neurons express the full-length BDNF/TrkB receptor. When sympathetic neuron-derived BDNF is increased 2- to 4-fold in transgenic mice, preganglionic cell bodies and axons hypertrophy, and the synaptic innervation to sympathetic neurons is increased. Conversely, when BDNF synthesis is eliminated in BDNF -/- mice, preganglionic synaptic innervation to sympathetic neurons is decreased. Together these results indicate that variations in neuronal neurotrophin synthesis directly regulate neuronal circuitry by selectively modulating synaptic innervation density."

https://openalex.org/W2038029958,"Strong, scattered reflections beyond 8 degrees (8degrees) offset are characteristic features of all high-resolution seismic sections from the continents. The reflections identify a low-velocity zone below approximately 100 kilometers depth beneath generally stratified mantle. This zone may be caused by partial melting, globally initiated at equal depth in the continental mantle. Solid state is again attained at the Lehmann discontinuity in cold, stable areas, whereas the zone extends to near the 400-kilometer discontinuity in hot, tectonically active areas. Thus, the depth to the Lehmann discontinuity may be an indicator of the thermal state of the continental mantle."
https://openalex.org/W1991008498,"Nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) contacts a bacterial RNA polymerase from distant enhancers by means of DNA loops and activates transcription by allowing polymerase to gain access to the template DNA strand. It was shown that NtrC from Salmonella typhimurium must build large oligomers to activate transcription. In contrast to eukaryotic enhancer-binding proteins, most of which must bind directly to DNA, some NtrC dimers were bound solely by protein-protein interactions. NtrC oligomers were visualized with scanning force microscopy. Evidence of their functional importance was provided by showing that some inactive non-DNA-binding and DNA-binding mutant forms of NtrC can cooperate to activate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2319302105,"Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been previously shown to suppress the malignant phenotype of human melanoma and breast cancer cells. To test the possible role of MnSOD in glioma malignancy, MnSOD was overexpressed in wild type human glioma U118 cells and subcloned U118-9 cells by transfection of human MnSOD cDNA. The MnSOD-transfected cell lines demonstrated expression of exogenous (plasmid) MnSOD mRNA, increase in MnSOD immunoreactive protein, and a three- to eightfold increase in MnSOD enzymatic activity. The MnSOD overexpressing cell lines became less malignant as demonstrated by requiring a higher serum concentration to grow in vitro and much slower tumor growth in nude mice than the parental and neo control cell lines. These findings further support the hypothesis that MnSOD may be a tumor suppressor gene in a wide variety of human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2063809960,"An iron-sulfur compound (Fe 3 S 2 ) was synthesized at pressures greater than 14 gigapascals in the system Fe-FeS. The formation of Fe 3 S 2 changed the melting relations from a simple binary eutectic system to a binary system with an intermediate compound that melted incongruently. The eutectic temperature in the system at 14 gigapascals was about 400°C lower than that extrapolated from Usselman's data, implying that previous thermal models of Fe-rich planetary cores could overestimate core temperature. If it is found in a meteorite, the Fe 3 S 2 phase could also be used to infer the minimum size of a parent body."
https://openalex.org/W2014372723,"The martian meteorite ALH84001 contains small, disk-shaped concretions of carbonate with concentric chemical and mineralogical zonation. Oxygen isotope compositions of these concretions, measured by ion microprobe, range from δ 18 O = +9.5 to +20.5‰. Most of the core of one concretion is homogeneous (16.7 ± 1.2‰) and over 5‰ higher in δ 18 O than a second concretion. Orthopyroxene that hosts the secondary carbonates is isotopically homogeneous (δ 18 O = 4.6 ± 1.2‰). Secondary SiO 2 has δ 18 O = 20.4‰. Carbon isotope ratios measured from the core of one concretion average δ 13 C = 46 ± 8‰, consistent with formation on Mars. The isotopic variations and mineral compositions offer no evidence for high temperature (&gt;650°C) carbonate precipitation and suggest non-equilibrium processes at low temperatures (&lt;∼300°C)."
https://openalex.org/W2018078955,"Individual GABAergic interneurons in hippocampus can powerfully inhibit more than a thousand excitatory pyramidal neurons. Therefore, control of interneuron excitability provides control over hippocampal networks. We have identified a novel mechanism in hippocampus that weakens excitatory synapses onto GABAergic interneurons. Following stimulation that elicits long-term potentiation at neighboring synapses onto excitatory cells, excitatory synapses onto inhibitory interneurons undergo a long-term synaptic depression (interneuron LTD; iLTD). Unlike most other forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, iLTD is not synapse specific: stimulation of an afferent pathway triggers depression not only of activated synapses but also of inactive excitatory synapses onto the same interneuron. These results suggest that high frequency afferent activity increases hippocampal excitability through a dual mechanism, simultaneously potentiating synapses onto excitatory neurons and depressing synapses onto inhibitory neurons."

This nonclassical state involves a continuum of transverse acoustic modes that leads to oscillations in the refractive index associated with the frequency of a van Hove singularity in the phonon density of states."
https://openalex.org/W2145462976,"Mechanisms underlying the learned vocal behavior of songbirds were studied by examining expression of the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos (Fos) in zebra finches. Auditory stimuli including the bird's own song did not induce Fos in the song system. In contrast, the motor act of singing induced Fos in two song sensorimotor nuclei, HVc and RA. This induction was independent of auditory feedback, since it occurred in deafened birds that sang. Double-labeling studies demonstrated that only one of the two sets of projection neurons in HVc expressed singing-related Fos. The motor-driven induction of Fos identifies functionally distinct cell populations in a network for singing and may point to sites of cellular plasticity necessary for song maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2065176684,"Breast, bladder, colon, and ovarian carcinomas show frequent low level 20q gain and less frequently high level 20q13.2 amplification, but the significance of these 20q amplifications in transformation has not been defined. Using karyotypic and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses, chromosome losses and gains were analysed in six newly immortalized human uroepithelial cell (HUC) lines transformed by Human Papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E7. Results showed clonal chromosomes with 20q11->qter gain in all six lines. CGH revealed a peak of 20q13.2 amplification in two cell lines. FISH with whole chromosome 20 paint showed expanded chromosome regions (ECRs) and double minute chromosomes (DMs) that contained chromosome 20 material in cell lines with 20q13.2 amplification. FISH with probes from the center of the 20q13.2 human breast cancer amplicon showed as many as 24 signals in cells with 20q13.2 amplification. The acquisition of genome instability in these E7-HUCs did not correlate with TP53 mutation, as all E7-HUCs contained only wildtype TP53. These results suggest that low level 20q gain is associated with overcoming cellular senescence in E7 transformed cells (P-value=2×10−7), but does not confer genome instability, while high level 20q13.2 amplification is associated with chromosome instability. Loss of 10p (P-value=3×10−5) was also important in immortalization of E7-transformed HUCs. Thus, these results have profound implications for interpreting the significance of high versus low level 20q gains in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2016234024,"Indirect evidence for life on Mars has been reported from the study of meteorite ALH84001. The formation temperature of the carbonates is controversial; some estimates suggest 20° to 80°C, whereas others exceed 650°C. Paleomagnetism can be used to distinguish between these possibilities because heating can remagnetize ferrimagnetic minerals. Study of two adjacent pyroxene grains from the crushed zone of ALH84001 shows that each possesses a stable natural remanent magnetization (NRM), implying that Mars had a substantial magnetic field when the grains cooled. However, NRM directions from these particles differ, implying that the meteorite has not been heated significantly since the formation of the internal crushed zone about 4 billion years ago. The carbonate globules postdate this brecciation, and thus formed at low temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1971845496,"One prominent effect of IFNs is their cell growth inhibitory activity. The exact molecular mechanism behind this inhibition of proliferation remains to be elucidated. Possible effectors for IFN-induced growth inhibition are the recently discovered cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The effect of IFN-α treatment on the members of the Ink4 and Cip/Kip families of Cdk inhibitors was investigated in three hematopoietic cell lines Daudi, U-266 and H9. Two of these cell lines, Daudi and U-266, respond to IFN-α by G1 arrest, whereas the H9 cell line is not growth arrested by IFN-α. We show that a p53-independent upregulation of p21 mRNA occurs following IFN-α treatment in all three cell lines. In Daudi and U-266 cells, the mRNA induction is accompanied by an increase in p21 protein, followed by an increased binding of p21 to Cdk2 and a subsequent decrease in Cdk2 activity, temporally coinciding with G1 arrest. In both these cell lines, there was also an increased binding of p21 to Cdk4. In contrast, p21 protein was not expressed in H9 cells, despite high levels of p21 mRNA following IFN-α treatment. In U-266 cells, IFN-α increased not only p21 but also p15 mRNA and protein levels, followed by an increased association of p15 with Cdk4. Furthermore, IFN-α treatment caused a four- to sixfold induction of the p16 E1β transcript in U-266 cells. Expression levels of the other Ink4 and Cip/Kip Cdk inhibitors were not induced by IFN treatment in any of the cell lines. We conclude that IFN-α can act as a potent regulator of Cdk-inhibitor expression, correlating with decreased Cdk activity and cell growth inhibition. One mechanism for resistance to IFN may be loss of the ability of cells to upregulate these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2309042391,"Formation of meningiomas has been associated with the loss of genetic material on chromosome 22. To approach the additional chromosomal events that underlie progression of these tumors to malignancy, we have examined several other chromosomal regions for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in these tumors. Fifty-eight tumors, comprising 43 benign meningiomas, 11 atypical meningiomas and four malignant meningiomas, were examined. While the loss of chromosome 22 was seen in approximately half of all these tumors, regardless of their malignancy, the most frequent chromosomal losses observed in the malignant and atypical tumors were on the long arm of chromosome 14. Thirty-nine tumors were informative for at least one of the three markers on chromosome 14 that we tested. Of these, 7/14 malignant and atypical tumors showed LOH in contrast to only 1/25 benign tumors. Other loci that showed LOH in malignant tumors, although at a much lower frequency, were on chromosomes 17p and 1p. The high frequency of LOH for loci on chromosome 14q in atypical and malignant tumors suggests the presence of a tumor progression gene at this locus. In one of the malignant meningiomas heterozygosity was lost at D14S13 and D14S16 but retained at the proximal marker D14S43 as well as the more distal marker D14S23. This suggests that an interstitial deletion occurred in this tumor which should be useful for further refining the position of the putative tumor progression locus."
https://openalex.org/W2326229326,"Invasive cervical cancer is very highly correlated with the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. Two viral proteins, E6 and E7, act in concert to subvert growth control of infected cells by inactivating the tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and Rb, respectively. E6 is thought to abrogate p53 function by stimulating its degradation via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in a reaction requiring E6AP (E6-Associated Protein). Here we evaluate the in vivo role of E6AP in p53 degradation in normal and HPV-infected cell types using antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODNs). This study shows that reduction of E6AP in vivo in high-risk HPV-infected cells leads to an elevation of p53, confirming the function of E6AP predicted by in vitro experiments. Further, we demonstrate that reduction of E6AP in normal cells has no effect on p53 levels, indicative of an E6AP-indpendent mechanism for p53 degradation. These experiments show that inhibition of intermediate proteins in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes or associated recognition proteins) can result in specific inhibition of substrate degradation. We propose that modulation of p53 levels by elimination of E6AP function may have therapeutic potential for cervical cancer."

Combination of borehole temperature profiles, which contain a memory of surface temperature changes in previous centuries, with the meteorological archive of surface air temperatures can provide a 19th-century baseline temperature tied to the current observational record. A test case in Utah, where boreholes are interspersed with meteorological stations belonging to the Historical Climatological Network, yields a noise reduction in estimates of 20th-century warming and a baseline temperature that is 0.6° ± 0.1°C below the 1951 to 1970 mean temperature for the region."

The data indicate that an upper bound to the solidus of the magnesiowüstite and perovskite assemblage at 4300 ± 270 kelvin is 130 ± 3 gigapascals. These conditions correspond to those for partial melting at the base of the mantle, as has been suggested occurs within the ultralow-velocity zone beneath the central Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W1988214676,"Multidrug resistance in MCF-7/Adr human breast cancer cells is mediated by several mechanisms including overexpression of the MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein and glutathione-related detoxifying enzymes. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor protein have been reported to play a role in the development of resistance to DNA damaging agents in several human cancer cells. In the present study we have assessed the mutational status of the p53 protein and its expression levels, degree of stability and cellular localization to investigate whether it is involved in modulating multidrug resistance in MCF-7/Adr cells compared to sensitive MCF-7 cells. As revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody DO-1, wild-type p53 is sequestered in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells, whereas in MCF-7/Adr cells, the protein is localized in the nucleus. The sequencing of full-length p53 cDNA revealed a 21 bp deletion in its one of the four conserved regions within the conformational domain, spanning codons 126-133 at exon five, in MCF-7/Adr cells. Moreover, detection of ThaI polymorphism of codon 72 showed that MCF-7 cells predominantly express wild-type p53 with proline, while mutated p53 in MCF-7/Adr cells contains an arginine residue at codon 72. In addition, we demonstrate that the half-life of p53 in MCF-7 cells is less than 30 min while the mutated protein is more stable; its half-life is about 4 h in MCF-7/Adr cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that the deletion of codons 126-133 in p53 causes increased stability, overexpression and nuclear localization of the protein in multidrug resistant MCF-7/Adr cells, and further suggests that mutated p53 might be involved in the development of multidrug resistance in this cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2314654345,"BCR/ABL has a causal role in Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome positive leukemia. The SH2/SH3 adapter protein CRKL is a major substrate of the deregulated BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase and is aberrantly tyrosine-phosphorylated in Ph-positive leukemia cells. In this study, experiments were pursued to identify and analyse the CRKL phosphorylation site(s). In an in vitro kinase assay, CRKL phosphorylation by the abl kinase was limited to a small region between the two CRKL SH3 domains. Within this region, mutation of tyrosine residue 207 yielded a mutant CRKL which could not be phosphorylated by BCR/ABL. Stable overexpression of CRKL or CRKL-Y207F did not transform NIH3T3 cells, while the Y207F mutation eliminated tyrosine-phosphorylation of CRKL. These studies indicate that Y207 in CRKL represents the major in vivo phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation of Y207 provides a binding site for the CRKL SH2 domain and potentially for other SH2-containing proteins. The Y207F mutation in CRKL did not enhance or decrease association with various target signalling proteins, including SOS or C3G, which interact specifically with the CRKL N-SH3 domain. These findings suggest that complex formation with cellular targets is not modulated by CRKL tyrosine-phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2323697765,"Much evidence has been gathered in support of a critical role for p53 in the cellular response to DNA damage. p53 dysfunction is associated with progression and poor prognosis of many human cancers and with a high incidence of tumours in p53 knockout mice. The absence of a p53-dependent G1 arrest that facilitates DNA repair or apoptosis might impact critically on clinical cancer in two ways. First, by abrogating the impact on therapy that operates via genotoxic damage and apoptosis; and second, by encouraging progression either by inducing genomic instability and DNA mis-repair or by permitting survival of mutants. However, experiments examining the relationship between p53 deficiency and mutation frequency have so far failed to confirm these predictions. The precise role played by p53 is therefore unclear. We now report use of a short term in vitro approach to assess the influence of p53 on radiation-induced mutations at the hprt locus in murine B cell precursors that are normally radiation ultrasensitive. We find a high number of hprt mutants among X-irradiated p53 null cells, which results from preferential survival as clonogenic mutants rather than from a p53-dependent increase in mutation rate. This result has important implications for genotoxic cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2334885729,"p53, a tumor suppressor gene, functioning as a transcription factor, has been recently shown in a cell free system to be subject to redox (reduction/oxidation) regulation. Oxidants or metal chelating reagents disrupt wildtype p53 conformation and decrease or abolish its DNA binding activity, while reductants restore wildtype conformation and increase DNA binding. We have extended these observations to intact cell systems by using luciferase transactivation assay in two murine tumor cell lines, both harboring endogenous wildtype p53. The results showed that none of these in vitro active reagents, except 1,10-phenanthroline (OP) has a significant effect on p53 transactivation activity. OP, a metal chelator and p53 inactivator in cell free systems, however, induces p53 transactivation activity as well as sequence-specific DNA binding in a dose dependent manner. OP also differentially induces endogenous expression of several known p53 target genes such as Waf-1 and Mdm-2, but not Bax, Gadd45, and PCNA. Increased p53 activity induced by OP is not due to elevated p53 mRNA nor to protein levels. Furthermore, the OP-induced p53 transcriptional activation is not due to its potential DNA intercalating activity, but mainly due to its metal chelating activity. OP was also found to induce dramatically apoptotic cell death in these tumor cells harboring wildtype p53, to a less extent in MEF cells from p53 knockout mice and not at all in Saos-2 cells without p53 or Rb. We concluded from this study that (a) unlike what has been seen in vitro, OP induces p53 activity in intact cells (b) OP activates p53 transcriptional activity without increasing p53 protein; and (c) activation of p53 may contribute to apoptosis, but is not required."

https://openalex.org/W2087876663,"The myeloid transforming gene Evi-1 encodes a protein with two zinc finger domains, designated ZF1 and ZF2, with distinct DNA binding specificities. For the first time we demonstrate that Evi-1 has transcriptional repressor activity which is directly proportional to the amount of Evi-1 protein in cells. Repression has been observed with two distinct promoters: the minimal HSV-1 tk promoter and a VP16 inducible adenovirus E1b minimal promoter. Optimal repression is DNA binding dependent and is mediated by either ZF1 or a heterologous GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) but is significantly less efficient through the ZF2 binding site. Both GAL4DBD/Evi-1 fusion and non-fusion proteins have been used to map the repressor activity to a proline-rich region located within amino acids 514 – 724 between the ZF1 and ZF2 domains. Constitutive expression of mutant proteins lacking the repressor domain are defective for transformation of Rat1 fibroblasts demonstrating that this region is required for the oncogenic activity of the Evi-1 protein. These studies show that the Evi-1 gene encodes a transcriptional repressor and has important implications for the mechanism of action of the Evi-1 protein both in development and in the progression of some myeloid leukaemias."
https://openalex.org/W2313537120,"TLS (FUS) and the related gene EWS encode the N-terminal portion of many fusion oncoproteins involved in human sarcomas and leukemia. TLS is an RNA-binding nuclear protein that is identical to hnRNP P2 and may be implicated in mRNA metabolism. When RNA polymerase II is inhibited, TLS immunostaining in the nucleus is dramatically altered, from its normal diffuse nucleoplasmic pattern to accumulation in dense nuclease-resistant aggregates. Co-immunostaining with antibodies to fibrillarin or p80 coilin and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the TLS aggregates are associated with the nucleolus and are distinct from other known structures such as the coiled body or the interchromatin granule. Injection of cells with an oligodeoxynucleotide that disrupts splicing does not result in redistribution of TLS, indicating that the event is specific to inhibition of transcription. Oncoproteins that contain the N-terminal domain from either TLS, EWS or their Drosophila homologue, SARFH (CAZ), are also targeted to the same structure. These findings suggest a correlation between the topogenic and transforming activities of TLS and EWS N-termini and imply the existence of cellular targets that are shared by the germ-line encoded proteins and their oncogenic derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2323266789,"Ral, a member of small GTP-binding protein (G protein) superfamily, has been suggested to act downstream of Ras, since Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) has been found to be an effector protein of Ras. In this study, we examined the effects of RalGDS and Ral on gene expression using c-fos promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (c-fos-luciferase). RalGDS interacted with RasG12V/E37G (in which Gly-12 and Glu-37 were changed to Val and Gly, respectively) which failed to bind to Raf in COS cells. RafCAAX is an active Raf kinase targeted to the plasma membranes by virtue of the addition of a C-terminal localization signal from K-Ras. Transfection of either RalGDS or RafCAAX into NIH3T3 cells slightly stimulated c-fos-luciferase expression and cotransfection of both proteins greatly enhanced the expression. RalGDS and an activated Rac (RacG12V) did not act synergistically to stimulate c-fos-luciferase expression. Transfection of an activated Ral (RalG23V) stimulated c-fos-luciferase expression. Furthermore, cotransfection of RalG23V and an activated Ras (RasG12V) enhanced RasG12V-dependent c-fos-luciferase expression. However, RalG23V did not synergize with RafCAAX, RacG12V or RalGDS to stimulate the expression. These results show that RalGDS and Ral regulate c-fos promoter activity and suggest that RalGDS may activate c-fos promoter synergistically with the signal from Raf by transmitting the signal to a target other than Ral."
https://openalex.org/W2081773727,"The inhibition of cell death by growth factors plays a key role in the maintenance of the haematopoietic system homeostasis. However the mechanisms involved in this inhibition are still poorly understood. In order to determine if inhibition of apoptosis by growth factors is dependent only on the expression of survival genes, we have studied that process in the bone marrow derived IL-3 dependent cell line Baf-3. We show that, following IL-3 starvation, mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-X but not Bcl-2 decrease rapidly preceeding the onset of death. The death of IL-3 starved cells is asynchronous, starting between 6 to 8 h with 50% death being reached after 10 to 12 h. At any time point, apoptosis can be rapidly inhibited by growth factor re-addition. This has allowed us to determine that the inhibition of apoptosis by growth factor takes place at two levels. The first one, which we have called short term inhibition, is independent of mRNA and protein synthesis i.e. it takes place in the absence of survival gene neosynthesis and can be demonstrated during the first 6 h following growth factor re-addition. The second one corresponds to long-term survival-more than 24 h survival-and is strongly correlated with the induction of Bcl-X but not Bcl-2 gene expression. This induction of Bcl-X by IL-3 is shown to be dependent on MAP-kinase activation."

https://openalex.org/W1969032559,"We show that the proliferation of astrocytes in the developing rodent optic nerve absolutely depends on axons and that this axonal influence depends on axonal transport but not on axonal electrical activity. We also show that purified retinal ganglion cells stimulate DNA synthesis in optic nerve astrocytes in culture and that the effect can be mimicked by fibroblast growth factor but not by neuregulins or several other growth factors. Taken together with previous findings, our present results indicate that axons promote glial cell proliferation and survival in the developing optic nerve by at least three distinct mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2334316609,"The cyclins and their catalytic partners, the Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs), are essential for progression through the cell cycle. Cyclin/kinase complexes containing cyclins A or E are active primarily in late G1 to S phase and both have been shown to phosphorylate histone H1 and the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) in vitro. Despite these similarities, cyclins A and E display differences in CDK activation and substrate specificity. We find that in vitro, cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin A/CDK2 phosphorylate histone H1 similarly but only cyclin A/CDK2 phosphorylates lamin B. While both cyclin A and cyclin E bind CDK1 efficiently, only cyclin A activates CDK1 kinase activity. Using chimeric proteins between cyclins A and E we find that both the cyclin box and C-terminus of cyclins A and E are required for CDK binding, activation and targeting of substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2324271538,"We have previously demonstrated that the core promoter of rat ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) contains an E-box-like sequence to which the core promoter binding factor CPBF binds and that the 44 kDa subunit of this protein is immunologically related to USF1, the helix--loop--helix-zipper DNA binding protein. Further, we showed that RNA polymerase I (pol I) transcription in vitro is competed by oligonucleotides containing USF-binding site, which suggested a key role for USF in rDNA transcription. To prove the potential role of USF in pol I transcription in vivo, USF1 and USF2 homodimers and USF1/USF2 heterodimer were overexpressed in CHO cells by transfection of the respective cDNAs. Co-transfection of a plasmid containing rDNA followed by primer extension analysis showed that overexpression of USF1 and USF2 as homodimers resulted in inhibition of rDNA transcription by as much as 85-90% whereas overexpression of USF1/USF2 in the heterodimeric form activated transcription approximately 3.5-fold. Transfection of mutant USF2 cDNA that is devoid of the basic DNA-binding domain produced only minimal inhibition of rDNA transcription. These data show that USF can modulate transcription of rRNA gene in vivo by functioning as a repressor (homodimer) or activator (heterodimer) of pol I transcription in vivo and suggest that inhibition of rDNA transcription may be responsible for the antiproliferative action of USF homodimers."

https://openalex.org/W2326802057,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a family of homodimeric proteins produced from a single gene by alternative splicing of the VEGF transcript. VEGF induces in vivo angiogenesis and vascular permeability. We have recently demonstrated that VEGF is an autocrine growth factor for retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. To further understand the role of VEGF, we overexpressed VEGF in rat RPE cells. The transfected cells exhibited a growth advantage in vitro and an increased response to the mitogenic effect of fibroblasts growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and formed colonies in soft agar upon FGF-2 addition. Moreover, analysis of FGF-receptors evidenced a dramatic increase in FGFR-1 mRNA and protein level, supporting the hypothesis that this receptor mediates the transforming effect of FGF-2. These results reveal that the oncogenic role of VEGF is exerted through a cross regulation between VEGF and FGF signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2335775962,"We have detected frequent alternative splicing of a gene that encodes NER, a protein homologous to the retinoic acid receptors, in cancer cells. Western and immunohistochemical analyses disclosed accumulation of a large amount of the aberrant NER product, generated by alternative splicing that caused skipping of an exon corresponding to the DNA-binding domain, in the nucleoli of cells of cancer cell lines and primary cancer tissues. The aberrant protein was detected in 116 of 228 primary cancers developed in various tissues including breast and colon, but was absent in the corresponding normal tissues; it was also detected in 31 of 39 cancer cell lines. This observation may imply that the aberrant NER product has some relation to the development and/or progression of cancers in a variety of human tissues."
