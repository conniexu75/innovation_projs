https://openalex.org/W1562998862,"Calcium-sensitive inositide release in a purified rat liver plasma membrane preparation is increased by calcium-mobilizing hormones in the presence of guanine nucleotides. Vasopressin-stimulated inositide release is evident in the presence of GTP or its nonhydrolyzable analogs guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S). The stimulation of inositide release by (-)-epinephrine (alpha 1), angiotensin II, or vasopressin in the presence of either 1 microM or 10 microM GTP gamma S correlates with the number of receptors present for each hormone. The guanine nucleotide and hormonal stimulation is evident on both inositol trisphosphate production and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate degradation. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N‘-tetraacetic acid (1 mM) completely abolishes stimulation by guanine nucleotides and hormone. Prior treatment of plasma membranes with cholera toxin or islet activating protein or prior injection of animals with islet activating protein does not affect stimulation of inositide release by GTP gamma S or GTP gamma S plus vasopressin. Stimulation by GTP gamma S is dependent upon magnesium and is inhibitable by guanosine 5‘-(2-O-thio) diphosphate. Inositide release from the plasma membrane exhibits half-maximal stimulation by calcium at approximately 100 nM free calcium in the presence of 1.5 mM MgCl2 and at approximately 10 microM free calcium in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2. Addition of guanine nucleotides decreases the requirement for calcium and also increases the activity at saturating calcium. The results presented suggest that calcium-mobilizing hormones stimulate polyphosphoinositide breakdown in rat liver plasma membranes through a novel guanine nucleotide binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1550856848,"Nuclear factor I (NF-I) is a cellular protein that enhances the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro. The enhancement of initiation correlates with the ability of NF-I to bind a specific nucleotide sequence within the viral origin of replication. We have developed a method for the purification of NF-I which is based upon the high affinity interaction between the protein and its recognition site. This approach may be generally applicable to the purification of other site-specific DNA binding proteins. The essential feature of the method is a two-step column chromatographic procedure in which proteins are first fractionated on an affinity matrix consisting of nonspecific (Escherichia coli) DNA and then on a matrix that is highly enriched in the specific DNA sequence that is recognized by NF-I. During the first step NF-I coelutes with proteins that have similar general affinity for DNA. During the second step NF-I elutes at a much higher ionic strength than the contaminating nonspecific DNA binding proteins. The DNA recognition site affinity matrix used in the second step is prepared from a plasmid (pKB67-88) that contains 88 copies of the NF-I binding site. This plasmid was constructed by means of a novel cloning strategy that generates concatenated NF-I binding sites arranged exclusively in a direct head to tail configuration. Using this purification scheme, we have obtained a 2400-fold purification of NF-I from crude HeLa nuclear extract with a 57% recovery of specific DNA binding activity. Throughout the purification procedure NF-I retained the ability to enhance the efficiency of initiation of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro. Electrophoresis of the purified fraction on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed a population of related polypeptides that ranged in apparent molecular weight from 66,000 to 52,000. The native molecular weight of NF-I deduced from gel filtration and glycerol sedimentation studies is 55,000 and the frictional ratio is 1.3. These results suggest that NF-I exists as a globular monomer in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2098671505,"Ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates have been used as substrates to identify an ATP-dependent protease from rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The enzyme, which has been partially purified by DEAE chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation, has an apparent molecular weight greater than 600,000 based on sedimentation and gel filtration. Whereas it degrades conjugated lysozyme molecules in the presence of ATP, the protease does not degrade free lysozyme molecules even upon addition of ubiquitin, lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates, and ATP. Degradation of lysozyme conjugates is independent of added ubiquitin and occurs in fractions incapable of ubiquitin conjugation. Proteolysis is maximal at pH 7.8, inhibited by hemin, N-ethylmaleimide, or aurintricarboxylic acid, and proceeds with an apparent Arrhenius activation energy in the range of 27 +/- 5 kcal/mol. These properties are similar to those observed for the degradation of lysozyme conjugates in lysates indicating that the partially purified protease catalyzes the second ATP-utilizing reaction identified previously (Hough, R., and Rechsteiner, M. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 90-94; Hershko, A., Leshinsky, E., Ganoth, D., and Heller, H. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 1619-1623; Tanaka, K., Waxman, L., and Goldberg, A. L. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 96, 1580-1585)."
https://openalex.org/W1509400195,"Thirteen endothelial cell growth factors have been purified to homogeneity by heparin affinity and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and their chromatographic and electrophoretic properties were compared. The amino acid compositions of 10 of these mitogens have also been determined. The results indicate that these heparin-binding growth factors (HBGFs) can be subdivided into two classes. Class 1 HBGFs are anionic mitogens of molecular weight 15,000-17,000 found in high levels in neural tissue and include acidic brain fibroblast growth factor and retina-derived growth factor. Class 2 HBGFs are cationic mitogens of molecular weight 18,000-20,000 found in a variety of normal tissues and are typified by pituitary fibroblast growth factor and cartilage-derived growth factor. Typical class 2 HBGFs have also been isolated from a rat chondrosarcoma, a human melanoma, and a human hepatoma, suggesting that tumors do not make a structurally distinct HBGF class. These results provide a sound basis for the evaluation of the HBGFs purified from a variety of tissues and species and for the delineation of their normal and pathological functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1517632284,"Catalysis of the H2O2-dependent oxidation of 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl (veratryl) alcohol by the hemoprotein ligninase isolated from wood-decaying fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds, is characterized. The reaction yields veratraldehyde and exhibits a stoichiometry of one H2O2 consumed per aldehyde formed. Ping-pong steady-state kinetics are observed for H2O2 (KM = 29 microM) and veratryl alcohol (KM = 72 microM) at pH 3.5. The magnitude of the turnover number varies from 2 to 3 s-1 at this pH, depending on the preparation of the enzyme. Each preparation of enzyme consists of a mixture of active and inactive enzyme. Extensive steady-state kinetic studies of several different preparations of enzyme, suggest a mechanism in which H2O2 reacts with enzyme to form an intermediate that subsequently reacts with the alcohol to return the enzyme to the resting state. The pH dependence of the overall reaction indicates that an ionization occurs having an apparent pK alpha approximately 3.1. The activity is, thus, nearly zero at pH 5 and increases to a maximum near pH approximately 2. However, the enzyme is unstable at this low pH. Transient-state kinetic studies reveal that, upon reaction of ligninase with H2O2, spectral changes occur in the Soret region, which, by analogy to previous studies of horseradish peroxidase, are consistent with formation of Compounds I and II. The active form of the enzyme appears to react rapidly with H2O2; we observed a positive correlation between the turnover number of the enzyme preparation and the extent of a rapid reaction between H2O2 and ligninase to form Compound I. Free radical cations derived from veratryl alcohol do not appear to be released from the enzyme during catalysis; however, other substrates are known to be converted to cation radicals (Kersten, P., Tien, M., Kalyanaraman, B., and Kirk, T.K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2609-2612). Our results are generally consistent with a classical peroxidase mechanism for the action of ligninase on lignin-like substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1563654697,"In order to further understand the molecular nature of the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel in skeletal muscle, we have performed classical radioligand binding studies and photoaffinity labeling with different types of tritiated inhibitors of the Ca2+ channel. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil, d-cis-[3H]diltiazem, and (+/-)-[3H]bepridil at their receptor sites in skeletal muscle transverse tubule membranes are: 1.5 +/- 0.5, 50 +/- 5, and 20 +/- 5 nM, respectively. Maximum binding capacities in picomoles/milligram of protein were: 70 +/- 10 for (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil, 50 +/- 15 for d-cis-[3H]diltiazem, and 75 +/- 15 for (+/-)-[3H]bepridil. The kinetics of association at 10 degrees C for the three types of tritiated compounds were relatively slow (3 X 10(5) M-1 S-1 for (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil, 8 X 10(3) M-1 S-1 for d-cis-[3H]diltiazem, and 4.2 X 10(5) M-1 S-1 for (+/-)-[3H]bepridil). The dissociation of (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil and d-cis-[3H]diltiazem from their receptor sites was also a slow process with half-lives of dissociation of 33 and 36 min, respectively. Competition studies using the three tritiated ligands suggest that they bind to the same receptor site which appears to be in a 1:1 stoichiometry with the dihydropyridine receptor. Photoaffinity labeling with high intensity ultraviolet light in the presence of (+/-)-[3H]bepridil or d-cis[3H]diltiazem resulted in the specific covalent incorporation of radioactivity into a polypeptide of Mr 170,000 +/- 10,000. A polypeptide of Mr 170,000 was also specifically labeled in photoaffinity labeling experiments using the high affinity dihydropyridine derivative (+)-[3H]PN 200-100."
https://openalex.org/W1522189913,"cDNA clones to human prepro-gastrin-releasing peptide (prepro-GRP) mRNA detect synthesis of prepro-GRP-related transcripts in 4 of 7 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and 1 of 2 metastatic SCLC tumors examined. A correlation is noted between prepro-GRP gene expression and the occurrence of bombesin-related immunoreactivity in SCLC cell lines. Examination of the structure of prepro-GRP transcripts found in SCLC reveals three types of prepro-GRP mRNA which differ in the structure of a putative GRP-associated peptide in the pro-GRP precursor. The subcellular distribution of prepro-GRP-related RNAs and structure of SCLC-derived prepro-GRP cDNA clones suggest that all three types of transcript could function as mRNAs, although there are differences in the prevalence of the different RNA types in different cellular compartments. Comparison of the sequence of cDNA clones with the sequence of a genomic prepro-GRP clone reveals that the three forms of prepro-GRP mRNA arise from a single primary transcript which undergoes alternative processing from two splice donor sites to two splice acceptor sites. The predicted amino acid sequence of the translated products of the three mRNAs are quite distinct, leading to predicted pro-GRP molecules of differing structure."
https://openalex.org/W1576513219,"The Escherichia coli dnaJ gene product is required for bacteriophage lambda DNA replication at all temperatures. It is also essential for bacterial viability in at least some conditions, since mutations in it result in temperature-sensitive bacterial growth. We have previously cloned the dnaJ gene and shown that its product migrates as a Mr 37,000 polypeptide under denaturing conditions. Here we present the primary DNA sequence of the dnaJ gene. It codes for a processed basic protein (63 basic and 51 acidic amino acids) composed of 375 amino acids totaling Mr 40,973. The predicted NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, overall amino acid composition, and isoelectric point agree well with those of the purified protein. We present evidence that the rate of expression of the dnaJ protein is increased by heat shock under the control of the htpR (rpoH) gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1525234184,"Pseudomonas testosteroni protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase catalyzes extradiol-type oxygenolytic cleavage of the aromatic ring of its substrate. The essential active site Fe2+ binds nitric oxide (NO) to produce an EPR active complex with an electronic spin of S = 3/2. Hyperfine broadening of the EPR resonances of the nitrosyl complex of the enzyme by protocatechuate (3,4-(OH)2-benzoate, PCA) enriched specifically with 17O (I = 5/2) in either the 3 or the 4 hydroxyl group shows that both groups can bind directly to the Fe2+ in the ternary complex. Analogous results are obtained for PCA binding to catechol 2,3-dioxygenase-NO complex suggesting that substrate binding by the Fe2+ may be a general property of extradiol dioxygenases. The protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase inhibitor, 4-17OH-benzoate binds directly to the Fe of the nitrosyl adduct of the enzyme through the OH group. Since previous studies have shown that water also is bound to the Fe in this ternary complex, but not in the ternary complex with PCA, the data strongly imply that there are 3 sites in the Fe coordination which can be occupied by exogenous ligands. 3-17OH-benzoate is an inhibitor of the enzyme but does not elicit detectable hyperfine broadening in the EPR spectrum of the nitrosyl adduct suggesting that it binds to the enzyme, but not to the Fe. The EPR spectra of ternary enzyme-NO complexes with PCA or 4-OH-benzoate labeled with 17O exclusively in the carboxylate substituent are not broadened, suggesting that this moiety does not bind to the Fe."
https://openalex.org/W1542129678,"Unmethylated calmodulins have been enzymatically methylated at lysine 115, and a direct effect of this methylation on NAD kinase activation has been shown. Similar to naturally occurring calmodulins with trimethyllysine 115, the enzymatically methylated calmodulins activated an NAD kinase preparation to a maximal level that was at least 3-fold lower than the level of activation obtained with the corresponding unmethylated calmodulins. Methylation did not alter the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activator properties of these calmodulins. A genetically engineered calmodulin containing an arginine at position 115 instead of a lysine was produced by site-specific mutagenesis of a cloned synthetic calmodulin gene. The arginine derivative retained the higher maximal NAD kinase activator properties of the unmethylated calmodulins but was no longer susceptible to the effects of the methyltransferase. The data indicate that the reduction in the level of NAD kinase activation is the direct result of trimethylation of lysine 115 of calmodulin, provide a precedent for a functional effect of trimethyllysine in a protein, and raise the possibility that some of calmodulin's physiological activities may be affected by lysine methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1566774081,"To produce ubiquitinated substrates for studies on ATP-dependent proteolysis, 125I-lysozyme was incubated in hemin-inhibited rabbit reticulocyte lysates. A portion of the labeled molecules became linked to ubiquitin in large covalent complexes. When these were partially purified and returned to uninhibited lysates containing ATP, the conjugated lysozyme molecules were degraded 10 times faster than free lysozyme. Purification of covalently modified lysozyme from hemin-inhibited lysates containing 125I-ubiquitin and 131I-lysozyme confirmed that both molecules were present in the complexes. The doubly labeled conjugates also permitted us to determine the fate of each molecule in uninhibited lysates. Besides degradation of lysozyme, there was a progressive release of intact lysozyme molecules from the complexes. This disassembly, which was the only fate of the complexes in the absence of ATP, proceeded through a series of smaller intermediates, several having molecular weights expected for ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates, and eventually free lysozyme was regenerated. The behavior of labeled ubiquitin was similar, though not identical, to that of lysozyme. Even in lysates containing ATP ubiquitin emerged from the complex undegraded. Furthermore, ubiquitin was present in a greater number of species than was lysozyme. The demonstration that ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates are rapidly degraded provides support for the hypothesis of Hershko, Rose, Ciechanover, and their colleagues that a key function of ubiquitin is to modify the proteolytic substrate. Further support for the hypothesis is presented in the following paper where we show that the conjugated lysozyme molecules are substrates for an ATP-dependent protease that does not degrade free lysozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1674979736,"The dnaJ and dnaK genes are essential for replication of Escherichia coli DNA, and they constitute an operon, dnaJ being downstream from dnaK. The amount of the dnaJ protein in E. coli is substantially less than that of the dnaK protein, which is produced abundantly. In order to construct a system that over-produces the dnaJ protein, we started our study by determining the DNA sequence of the entire dnaJ gene, and an operon fusion was constructed by inserting the gene downstream of the lambda PL promoter of an expression vector plasmid, pPL-lambda. Cells containing the recombinant plasmid produced dnaJ protein amounting to 2% of the total cellular protein when cells were induced. The overproduced protein was purified, and Edman degradation of the protein indicated that the NH2-terminal methionine was found to be processed. From the DNA sequence of the dnaJ gene, the processed gene product is composed of 375 amino acid residues, and its molecular weight is calculated to be 40,975."
https://openalex.org/W1524783236,"Abstract A combination of reverse phase and normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography has been used to separate the reduced oligosaccharides produced by alkaline borohydride degradation of a blood group A ovarian cyst mucin glycoproteins. Fourteen compounds, ranging in size from a monosaccharide to a decasaccharide, have been isolated preparatively using a Zorbax C-18 reverse phase column eluted with water and a MicroPak AX-5 normal phase column eluted with aqueous acetonitrile. The purity of the products and their structures were determined from the fully assigned high field proton NMR spectra. The resonances of exchangeable amide protons, observed by the Redfield selective pulse sequence in H2O, were assigned by decoupling to the resonances of H2 of the 2-acetamido sugars. Nuclear Overhauser effects were used to establish the relationship of the anomeric protons and those of the aglycone. In exception to earlier proposals that nuclear Overhauser effect on irradiation of the anomeric proton should always be observed at the proton attached to the aglycone carbon, we find that for the linkage of GalNAcp(1----3)Gal, nuclear Overhauser effect on irradiation of the alpha-anomeric proton resonance is observed not at H3 but at H4 of galactose. A combination of NMR methods and enzymatic degradation was employed to determine the structures of 13 different oligosaccharides of which seven have not previously been reported. These oligosaccharides, which terminate with beta-Gal, alpha-Fuc, beta-GlcNAc, and alpha-GalNAc, account for 75% of the total glycoprotein carbohydrate, the remainder being isolated as a mixture of glycopeptides and a high molecular weight polysaccharide whose NMR spectrum implies a simple repeating subunit structure closely related to that of the oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1531775754,"The cellular mechanism by which glucocorticoids stimulate phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis has been studied in the fetal rat lung in vivo and in cultured fetal rat lung cells of varying levels of complexity. Administration of dexamethasone to pregnant rats at 18 days gestation resulted in a significant increase in saturated phosphatidylcholine content in fetal lung 24 h after injection. Dexamethasone administration increased the activity of fetal lung choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase by 34%. It had no effect on the activities of fetal lung choline kinase and choline phosphotransferase. Exposure of fetal lung type II cells in organotypic cultures (which contain both type II cells and fibroblasts) to cortisol resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in the incorporation of [Me-3H]choline into saturated phosphatidylcholine. The activities of the enzymes in the choline pathway for the de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine were not significantly altered except for a 105% increase in choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity. Treatment of monolayer cultures of fetal type II cells with cortisol-conditioned medium from fetal lung fibroblasts resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in saturated phosphatidylcholine production. This effect correlated with a doubling of choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity. Additional evidence that this stimulatory action is mediated by fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor, produced by fetal lung fibroblasts in response to cortisol, was obtained. The factor was partially purified from cortisol-conditioned medium of fetal lung fibroblasts by gel filtration and affinity chromatography. Based on biological activity, a 3000-fold purification was obtained. Stimulation of saturated phosphatidylcholine synthesis in type II cells by fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor was maximal within 60 min of incubation. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the stimulatory effect was correlated with an increased conversion of choline phosphate into CDP choline. Moreover, the enhanced phosphatidylcholine formation by fetal type II cells in response to fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor was accompanied by decreased levels of cellular choline phosphate. These findings further support the concept that glucocorticoid action on surfactant-associated phosphatidylcholine synthesis occurs ultimately at the level of the alveolar type II cell and involves fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor which stimulates the activity of choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1556836422,"We used capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to demonstrate that a cell line derived from a well differentiated human hepatoblastoma, HepG2, synthesized and secreted the following bile acids (ng/10(7) cells/h): chenodeoxycholic acid (131.4), cholic acid (3.3), 3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid (DHCA; 4.5), and 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid (THCA; 32.0). Deuterium from [7 beta-2H]7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, which was added to the media, was incorporated into newly synthesized chenodeoxycholic acid, DHCA, and THCA, but not into cholic acid. Since THCA is a known precursor of cholic acid, these data suggest that HepG2 is specifically deficient in the side chain cleavage that transforms THCA into cholic acid. Greater than 90% of the bile acids synthesized and secreted by HepG2 were unconjugated. Conjugation could not be stimulated by the addition of glycine or taurine to the media. Approximately 30% of newly synthesized DHCA and THCA were sulfated. Chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid were not appreciably sulfated. In summary, cultured HepG2 cells synthesize bile acid, but in a pattern distinct from that of adult human liver. This cell line may be a model for studying pathways of human bile acid synthesis, conjugation, and sulfation."
https://openalex.org/W1538017689,"Escherichia coli contains several lipoproteins in addition to the major outer membrane lipoprotein (Ichihara, S., Hussain, M., and Mizushima, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3125-3129). We cloned the gene for one of these new lipoproteins by using a synthetic 15-mer oligonucleotide probe identical to the DNA sequence at the signal peptide cleavage site of the major lipoprotein. The DNA sequence of the cloned gene revealed an open reading frame encoding a 272-amino acid protein with a signal peptide of 23 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of the putative cleavage site region of the signal peptide, -Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Cys-, is identical to that of the major lipoprotein. When the cloned gene was expressed in E. coli, a gene product with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 29,000 was identified which agrees well with the calculated molecular weight (27,800). The product was labeled with [3H]glycerol, and a precursor molecule of increased molecular weight was accumulated when cells were treated with globomycin, a specific inhibitor for prolipoprotein signal peptidase. We thus designed the gene product as lipoprotein-28. Unlike the major lipoprotein, lipoprotein-28 was found to be localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. A possible orientation of lipoprotein-28 in the E. coli envelope is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1536792772,"N,N-Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), a copper-chelating agent, not only inhibits superoxide dismutase activity in the red cell, but also depletes glutathione and promotes the production of methemoglobin, sulfhemoglobin, and small amounts of lipid peroxidation products. DDC reacts with oxyhemoglobin to yield disulfiram, hydrogen peroxide, and methemoglobin. Disulfiram and hydrogen peroxide both convert GSH to GSSG, while DDC reduces methemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin. Although disulfiram also reacts with the hemoglobin sulfhydryl groups, this reaction does not play a role in the conversion of GSH to GSSG. Other hemoglobin derivatives, ferrous, and ferric ions do not catalyze the oxidation of GSH by DDC. These results support the conclusion that DDC reacts with the super-oxo-ferriheme complex of oxyhemoglobin to generate hydrogen peroxide and disulfiram and that the cyclic conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin and DDC and disulfiram results in the net oxidation of GSH. Thus, damage to DDC-treated erythrocytes exposed to a putative superoxide-generating toxin, such as 1,4-naphthoquinone-2-sulfonate, may actually be due to diminished GSH concentration and hemoglobin oxidation rather than to superoxide radicals. Glucose added to the incubation medium of DDC-treated erythrocytes fully prevented glutathione depletion but not the oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. Several other copper-chelating agents either failed to inhibit the activity of purified superoxide dismutase or when incubated with erythrocytes produced more extensive GSH depletion and hemoglobin oxidation than DDC. It is concluded that the interpretation of results with erythrocytes exposed to copper-chelating agents must consider their effects on GSH and hemoglobin as well as on superoxide dismutase inhibition. Moreover, one must be mindful of the interference by DDC in the analysis of GSH with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the absence of sufficient quantities of metaphosphoric acid to destroy DDC and that contamination of DDC with trace quantities of disulfiram may be a significant problem."
https://openalex.org/W1587893698,"This paper presents definitive results which establishes a direct gene-protein product relationship between the pgsA gene and the phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase of Escherichia coli. The predicted protein sequence derived from the determined DNA sequence of pgsA is in close agreement with the amino acid composition and partially determined amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The purified synthase has the same apparent molecular mass as the gene product made by a plasmid-directed transcription-translation system. The plasmid-borne copy of the pgsA gene is also capable of expressing enzymatically active synthase in vitro. The DNA sequence analysis has established the exact linear relationship between the uvrC, pgsA, and glyW loci and revealed that these three genes are transcribed in the same direction. The terminal coding regions of these three genes also share common sequences with transcriptional regulatory elements for the adjacent genes."
https://openalex.org/W1519233482,"Differential inductive effects of lead on protein synthesis in rat fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells were examined. The lead was administered as lead glutamate, a complex known to introduce lead into cells. Lead exposure induced the synthesis of three proteins which constitute two separate stress protein subgroups. Two of these proteins have been previously identified as the glucose-regulated proteins because their synthesis is induced by reagents which perturb glucose utilization. The third protein is inducible by several sulfhydryl-binding reagents including lead. This third protein has been compared with a protein, p32/6.3, of very similar size and isoelectric point, which has been associated with lead-induced intranuclear inclusion bodies. However, several features, including one-dimensional peptide maps, indicated that the third protein and p32/6.3 are not identical. The three lead-induced proteins are distinguished from the major group of stress proteins by their relative insensitivity to heat stress. Lead glutamate, on the other hand, induces neither the heat shock protein 70 nor metallothionein, both of which are strongly induced by several metals including cadmium, zinc, and mercury."
https://openalex.org/W1557484643,"The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of trypanosomes is comprised of thousands of DNA minicircles and 20-50 maxicircles catenated into a single network. We show that kinetoplasts isolated from the trypanosomatid species Crithidia fasciculata incorporate labeled nucleotides and support minicircle DNA replication in a manner which mimics two characteristics of minicircle replication in vivo: 1) the minicircles are replicated as free molecules and subsequently reattached to the kDNA network, and 2) a replication intermediate having a structure consistent with a highly gapped minicircle species is generated. In addition, a class of minicircle DNA replication intermediates is observed containing discontinuities at specific sites within each of the newly synthesized DNA strands. By using a strain of C. fasciculata possessing nearly homogenous minicircles, we were able to map the discontinuities to two small regions situated 180 degrees apart on the minicircle. Each region has two sites at which a discontinuity can occur, one on each strand and separated by approximately 100 base pairs. These sites may represent origins of minicircle DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1564187709,"125I-Labeled atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was covalently cross-linked to its binding sites in bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa membranes using the hydrophilic cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol revealed that two protein bands with apparent Mr 68,000 and 114,000 were specifically labeled. The labeling of the two bands was prevented in a dose-dependent fashion by unlabeled ANF with a significant inhibition observed at 10(-10) M. High concentrations of angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropic hormone did not compete with 125I-ANF for binding and cross-linking. The dose-response curve for inhibition of covalent cross-linking of 125I-ANF by unlabeled ANF coincided with the dose-response curve for inhibition of binding to the receptor. No radioactive bands were observed in liver membranes. Experiments in which adrenal membranes were prepared and incubated in the presence of protease inhibitors showed no difference in the labeling pattern. Electrophoresis in the absence of reductant showed that the affinity-labeled species are not derived from larger disulfide-linked components. The apparent molecular weight of the two labeled species was not affected by a 100-fold variation in cross-linker concentration, and the labeling of both species increased in parallel. Possible relationships between the two labeled species are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598336000,"To determine the possible intrarenal site of action of an endogenous ouabain-like natriuretic factor, we searched for the presence of NaK-ATPase highly sensitive to ouabain in the kidney, an organ previously reported to display a low sensitivity to ouabain. For this purpose, the sensitivity of NaK-ATPase to ouabain was determined at the level of single, well defined segments of nephron microdissected from rabbit kidney. Results indicated that NaK-ATPase activity is 10- to 30-fold more sensitive to ouabain in the collecting tubule, where final adjustments of sodium excretion take place, than in more proximal segments of the nephron. [3H]Ouabain binding experiments confirmed this finding as the affinity for ouabain increases from the proximal tubule to the collecting tubule. These results suggest that endogenous natriuretic factor may control sodium transport in the collecting tubule preferentially."
https://openalex.org/W1656714822,"We have investigated intermolecular interactions and conformational features of the netropsin X d(G-G-A-A-T-T-C-C) complex by one- and two-dimensional NMR studies in aqueous solution. Netropsin removes the 2-fold symmetry of the d(G-G-A-A-T-T-C-C) duplex at the AATT binding site and to a lesser extent at adjacent dG X dC base pairs resulting in doubling of resonances for specific positions in the spectrum of the complex at 25 degrees C. We have assigned the amide, pyrrole, and CH2 protons of netropsin, and the base and sugar H1' protons of the nucleic acid from an analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY) and correlated (COSY) spectra of the complex at 25 degrees C. We observe intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) between all three amide and both pyrrole protons on the concave face of the antibiotic and the minor groove adenosine H2 proton of the two central A4 X T5 base pairs of the d(G1-G2-A3-A4-T5-T6-C7-C8) duplex. Weaker intermolecular NOEs are also observed between the pyrrole concave face protons and the sugar H1' protons of residues T5 and T6 in the AATT minor groove of the duplex. We also detect intermolecular NOEs between the guanidino CH2 protons at one end of netropsin and adenosine H2 proton of the two flanking A3 X T6 base pairs of the octanucleotide duplex. These studies establish a set of intermolecular contacts between the concave face of the antibiotic and the minor groove AATT segment of the d(G-G-A-A-T-T-C-C) duplex in solution. The magnitude of the NOEs require that there be no intervening water molecules sandwiched between the antibiotic and the DNA so that release of the minor groove spine of hydration is a prerequisite for netropsin complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1588118800,"The mechanism by which rat liver asialoglycoprotein receptor (rat hepatic lectin, RHL) is inserted into membranes has been investigated. RHL is a prototype for transmembrane proteins which are oriented with their NH2 termini in the cytoplasm and their COOH termini outside the cell. Such transmembrane proteins are synthesized without cleavable NH2-terminal signal sequences. An in vitro translation system has been developed in which RHL is translated from RNA produced in a bacteriophage SP6 in vitro transcription system. RHL produced in this way can be inserted cotranslationally in the correct orientation into dog pancreas microsomes. This insertion process has been shown to be dependent on the signal recognition particle and its receptor (the docking protein) in the microsomal membranes. A detailed mechanism for the insertion of this type of transmembrane protein into the lipid bilayer is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1538750795,"Abstract Examination of a cell-free reconstitution of intercompartmental transport through the Golgi apparatus has enabled detection of two intermediates in the pathway (Balch, W. E., Glick, B. S., and Rothman, J. E. (1984) Cell 39, 525-536). These intermediates are thought to represent stages in the budding and fusion reactions of transport vesicles mediating such a transport process. Here we describe a new transport intermediate that is interposed between the previously established primed donor formation and the N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-resistant acceptor intermediates. Consumption of this intermediate requires much less cytosol than its formation, and thus it has been termed the intermediate. The dilution-resistant intermediate only forms in the presence of donor and acceptor membranes, and its consumption is sensitive to NEM. The transition from this state to the later, NEM-resistant form of the prefusion complex requires ATP as well as cytosol and may represent a processing of transport vesicles to permit their fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1594908797,"Abstract Cytosolic components are required to produce the primed donor and to consume the intermediates of the intercompartmental protein transport pathway as elucidated in a cell-free system (Balch, W. E., Glick, B. S., and Rothman, J. E. (1984) Cell 39, 525-536, and Wattenberg, B. W., Balch, W. E., and Rothman, J. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2202-2207). Widely different levels of crude cytosol are required for each of these steps, suggesting that different cytosolic components might mediate each step. Here, we fractionate cytosol and demonstrate that there are multiple transport-active components. Furthermore, we report the development of stage-specific functional assays which reveal that a distinct soluble component is required in the consumption of the dilution-resistant intermediate. This component, of about 25 kilodaltons in its apparent native molecular mass, is derived from calf brain cytosol. While this component mediates the consumption of the dilution-resistant intermediate, it is inactive in the priming stage. This stage-specific component seems likely to be involved in the processing of transport vesicles after the attachment of those vesicles to the target membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1569578425,"The basal and plus insulin states of glucose transport activity in adipocytes are known to show different responses to changes in the pH or osmolarity of the incubation mixture. When the pH was raised from 7 to 8, the basal glucose transport activity (assessed from the rate of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake) was increased approximately 3-fold while the plus insulin activity remained virtually unaffected. Likewise, when cells were exposed to 300 mM sorbitol, the basal glucose transport activity, but not the plus insulin activity, was considerably increased. In both cases, the change in the transport activity was ATP-dependent and was completed in approximately 60 min. The increase in the cellular glucose transport activity was accompanied, in both cases, by an increase in the glucose transport activity in the plasma membrane fraction and a decrease in the activity in the high-speed pellet fraction. The transport activity in the subcellular fractions was determined after reconstitution into egg lecithin liposomes. Both isotonic buffer at pH 8.0 and hypertonic buffer at pH 7.4 significantly stimulated membrane-bound cAMP phosphodiesterase in adipocytes. It is concluded that the above two experimental conditions may induce insulin-like effects in fat cells and may facilitate translocation of the glucose transport activity from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1608400791,"Prolactin receptors were purified to homogeneity by two affinity chromatography steps using concanavalin A-Sepharose and human growth hormone (hGH)-Sepharose. The purified receptors showed specificity and high affinity for lactogenic hormones and a binding capacity of 20 nmol/mg of protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that purified receptors were composed of two major protein bands of Mr = 41,000 and 88,000, which were identified as radioactive bands by binding of 125I-hGH to blotted renatured receptors and by autoradiogram of free and 125I-radiolabeled purified receptors. Autoradiographic analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cross-linked 125I-hGH-receptor or hGH-125I-iodinated receptor complexes showed two radioactive bands of Mr = 63,000 and 106,000. Analysis of the free receptors by high performance liquid chromatography using Superose 12 revealed two peaks of binding activity for 125I-hGH eluting in the positions of Mr approximately 150,000 and 250,000. After cross-linking with 125I-hGH, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that both peak fractions contained two binding species with Mr = 63,000 and 106,000. Chromatography of 125I-hGH-receptor complexes showed two radioactive fractions with approximate Mr approximately 180,000 and 300,000. The treatment of 125I-iodinated receptors with SDS and reductant resulted in the dissociation of the higher Mr form into the lower Mr form upon gel filtration. Chromatofocusing of free receptors showed three isoforms with pI 4.0, 5.0, and 5.3. These results indicate that detergent-solubilized prolactin receptors appear to be aggregated forms of holoreceptor containing two binding species of Mr = 41,000 +/- 2,000 and 88,000 +/- 3,000."
https://openalex.org/W1545780476,"The interaction of immunopurified high mobility group 2a protein (HMG-2a) with DNA was examined by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The relative binding activity of HMG-2a for synthetic polynucleotides was: (dI).(dC) greater than (dA-dT).(dA-dT) greater than (dA).(dT) much greater than (dG).(dC) greater than (dG-dC).(dG-dC). The protein also exhibited a marked preference for (A + T)-rich restriction fragments derived from rat and Drosophila satellites, yeast centromeres, phage lambda, and the ovalbumin gene and its 5' flanking sequences. These preferential DNA interactions occurred at ionic strengths and temperatures within the physiological range which argue for an in vivo role of DNA stability in dictating the genomic distribution of the large Mr HMG proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1675084292,"A characteristic feature of chronic lead intoxication is the induction of intranuclear inclusion bodies in cells lining kidney proximal tubules. These are relatively insoluble lead- and protein-rich structures which may serve a protective function by sequestering lead. The most abundant protein of isolated inclusion bodies, p32/6.3, has been partially characterized by use of a monoclonal antibody. As predicted by biochemical analysis, p32/6.3 occurs in kidney only in conjunction with lead intoxication and inclusion body formation. It does not accumulate in other tissues as a result of lead exposure. Unexpectedly, p32/6.3 was found to be a constitutive protein of adult brain, occurring primarily in the cerebral cortex. Within this tissue, both neurons and astrocytes contained p32/6.3. The brain p32/6.3 was concentrated in the insoluble nuclear protein or matrix fraction, a localization reminiscent of the intranuclear inclusion bodies from lead-exposed kidney. Brain p32/6.3 was detected in rat, mouse, dog, man, and chicken. In rat brain, the appearance of p32/6.3 was developmentally regulated. Only traces were detected 3 days after birth but within 1-2 weeks adult levels were achieved. The presence in brain of a protein which is involved in a potentially protective response to lead suggests that the brain may also have such a protective mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1506499528,"The chromatin structure of the promoter region of the human dihydrofolate reductase gene was determined using a variety of nucleases including DNase I, micrococcal nuclease, several restriction endonucleases, exonuclease III, and Bal31. Two separate regions from -670 to -340 (the distal hypersensitive region) and from -170 to +150 (the proximal hypersensitive region) were shown to be essentially free of proteins as indicated by their accessibility to both endo- and exonucleases. Within the proximal hypersensitive region, one protein appears to be bound at the start site for transcription. A 170-base pair fragment between the two hypersensitive regions was highly resistant to all nucleases tested. Multiple barriers against exonuclease digestion and resistance to dissociation by high salt concentrations suggest that more than one protein is tightly bound to this region. The upstream sequence from -670 and the downstream sequence from +150 were shown to be packaged into nucleosomes. The selective accessibility of certain sites to micrococcal nuclease cutting indicates that the initial nucleosomes are phased upstream from the distal hypersensitive region. There appears to be a protein bound between the phased nucleosomes and the upstream boundary of the distal hypersensitive region. These results suggest that the normal nucleosome array is interrupted by about 900 base pairs of nucleosome-free DNA to which several nuclear proteins bind in a DNA sequence-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2121988816,"Fusion of Sendai virus envelopes with erythrocyte membranes or with phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes requires the presence of the two viral glycoproteins, namely the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion (F) polypeptides. Membrane vesicles bearing only the HN or the F glycoprotein (HN or F vesicles) or a mixture of both do not possess fusogenic activity. These results clearly show that in order to be fusogenic, the two viral envelope glycoproteins must be present within the same membrane, thus indicating their mutual interaction. Circular dichroism studies revealed that the conformation of the viral glycoproteins in reconstituted viral envelopes or in HN-F vesicles (vesicles formed by co-reconstitution of the HN and F glycoproteins) is different from that of the conformation of these glycoproteins in either HN or F vesicles or in a mixture of both. It has been observed that the mean residue ellipticity as measured at 222 nm (theta 222) of the viral glycoproteins in reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes (RSVE) is lower by about 75% than the value observed for these glycoproteins in isolated HN or F vesicles. Treatment of RSVE or of HN-F vesicles with inhibitors of the viral fusogenic activity such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, proteolytic enzymes, or incubation at 70 degrees C caused a substantial conformational change in the viral glycoproteins. The theta 222 of unfusogenic RSVE or unfusogenic HN-F vesicles is very close to that observed for a mixture of HN and F vesicles. It is proposed here that in order to be fusogenic, the viral envelope glycoproteins must possess a certain conformation which exists only when they are present within the same membrane."

The lattice was formed rapidly in a medium containing K+, vanadate, Mg2+, and dimethyl sulfoxide at pH 6.0-6.9 in imidazole buffer from 4 to 22 degrees C. The crystal lattice exhibited P2 symmetry, and the unit cell dimension (a = 5.6, b = 11, and c = 10 nm) could accommodate 2 polypeptides of mass 116-129 kDa. In addition, the isolated preparation contained previously undescribed long cylindrical structures 16 nm thick.

https://openalex.org/W1495187969,"To obtain kinetic information about the pointed ends of actin filaments, experiments were carried out in the presence of gelsolin which blocks all events at the kinetically dominant barbed ends. The 1:2 gelsolin-actin complex retains 1 mol/mol of actin-bound ATP, but it neither hydrolyzes the ATP nor exchanges it with ATP free in solution at a significant rate. On the other hand, the actin filaments with their barbed ends capped with gelsolin hydrolyze ATP relatively rapidly at steady state, apparently as a result of the continued interaction of ATP-G-actin with the pointed ends of the filaments. ATP hydrolysis during spontaneous polymerization of actin in the presence of relatively high concentrations of gelsolin lags behind filament elongation so that filaments consisting of as much as 50% ATP-actin subunits are transiently formed. Probably for this reason, during polymerization the actin monomer concentration transiently reaches a concentration lower than the final steady-state critical concentration of the pointed end. At steady state, however, there is no evidence for an ATP cap at the pointed ends of gelsolin-capped filaments, which differs from the barbed ends which do have an ATP cap in the absence of gelsolin. As there is no reason presently to think that gelsolin has any effect on events at the pointed ends of filaments, the properties of the pointed ends deduced from these experiments with gelsolin-capped filaments are presumably equally applicable to the pointed ends of filaments in which the barbed ends are free."
https://openalex.org/W1560179086,"To investigate biosynthesis and intracellular transport of 5'-nucleotidase, we purified this enzyme from rat liver and prepared antibodies. In immunoblot analysis, 5'-nucleotidase from the plasmalemmal, Golgi, and tritosomal fractions migrated as a single band of 72 kDa. The immunoreactive 68-kDa band was detected in the rough microsomal fraction and only the 72-kDa polypeptide contained sialic acids. The single polypeptide of 61 kDa immunoprecipitated from the translation products with the membrane-bound polysomal RNAs by the cell-free system converted to the 68-kDa form associated with membranes, when translated in the presence of microsomal vesicles. 5'-Nucleotidase from cultured primary hepatocytes pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min migrated as a 68-kDa polypeptide. Within 45 min of chase, the 68-kDa form was converted to the 72-kDa form. Upon treatment with tunicamycin, a new immunoreactive polypeptide of 59 kDa was obtained. These results suggest that 5'-nucleotidase is translated on the membrane-bound polysomes as a 61-kDa precursor and that the cleavage of the 2-kDa signal peptide and the core glycosylation co-translationally convert the precursor to the 68-kDa form, which is subsequently processed in the Golgi complex to the 72-kDa form."
https://openalex.org/W1533679071,"Genomic DNA coding for human fibronectin was identified from a human genomic library by screening with a cDNA clone that specifies the cell attachment domain in human fibronectin. Two clones which together provided more than 22 kilobase pairs of the fibronectin gene were isolated. The exons in this region correspond to approximately 40% of the coding region in the fibronectin gene. They code for the middle region of the polypeptide which consists of homologous repeating segments of about 90 amino acids called type III homologies. Nucleotide sequence of the portion of the gene corresponding to the cell attachment domain showed that the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser cell attachment site is encoded within a 165-base pair exon. This exon, together with a 117-base pair exon codes for a homology unit. Analysis of the exon/intron organization in some of the neighboring homology units indicated a similar 2-exon structure. An exception to this pattern is that a single large exon codes for a type III homology unit that, due to alternative mRNA splicing, exists in some but not all fibronectin polypeptides. The introns separating the coding sequences for the type III homology units are located in conserved positions whereas the introns that interrupt the coding sequence within the units are in a variable position generating variations in the size of the homologous exons. This exon/intron organization suggests that the type III homology region of the fibronectin gene has evolved by a series of gene duplications of a primordial gene consisting of two exons. Specification of one of these homology units to the cell attachment domain has occurred within this exon/intron arrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1524989206,"We have followed the synthesis and secretion of a number of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins in three strains of Escherichia coli, a secA amber mutant, a secA temperature-sensitive mutant, and a strain that blocks protein secretion due to a high level of expression of an export-defective hybrid protein between maltose-binding protein and beta-galactosidase (MalE-LacZ). Our results show that after several hours under nonpermissive conditions the specificity and extent of the export blocks in the secA temperature-sensitive mutant and the strain producing the MalE-LacZ hybrid protein are identical, affecting at least four major outer membrane proteins and most but not all periplasmic proteins. The secA gene product, therefore, appears to be an essential component of the major export pathway in E. coli which is used by many envelope proteins independent of whether they are cotranslationally or post-translationally secreted. In contrast, the synthesis of only a subset of these envelope proteins is reduced in the secA amber mutant after shift to the nonpermissive condition. These results indicate that the SecA protein serves roles both in the synthesis and the secretion of certain cell envelope proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1909238008,"The equilibrium binding of sodium, potassium, and adenine nucleotides to dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase was studied by measuring changes in the fluorescence of enzyme labeled with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF). The intensity of the fluorescence emission at 520 nm of the bound fluorescein (excited at 490 nm) is increased by ATP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), ADP (but not AMP), and Na+, and decreased by K+, Rb+, NH+4, and LI+. Thus the fluorescence effects correlate with the ability of these groups of ligands to stabilize E1 and E2 conformations, respectively. The Na+-induced increase in fluorescence has two components: a slow, high-affinity increase of approximately 7% (K0.5 = 0.16 mM) with positive cooperativity; and a large (approximately 15%), rapid, low-affinity (K0.5 = 34 mM) increase that is not cooperative. The K0.5 for the high-affinity effect is decreased by oligomycin and increased by K+. ATP effects on the fluorescence follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics and are of high affinity (K0.5 = 0.12 microM); K+ increases the K0.5 for ATP, AMP-PNP, and ADP but does not induce cooperative behavior. K+ itself decreases the fluorescence signal by about 9%, with high affinity (K0.5 = 5 microM), showing Michaelis-menten behavior in the absence of other ligands, while with ATP, Na+, or Mg2+ present, K+ effects are cooperative and of lower affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1508175837,"One of the intermediates involved in dissociation and reassociation of the subunits of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been characterized. This intermediate can be generated when the protein kinase is prepared from the isolated catalytic subunit (C) and the isolated regulatory subunit-[3H]cAMP complex (R2-[3H]cAMP4) by dialysis for 18 h followed by gel filtration. The intermediate, which could be separated from the holoenzyme and the isolated subunits by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, had an apparent molecular weight of 149,000, consistent with an R2C form. Following electrophoresis, measurements of R and bound nucleotide indicated that R2C was half-saturated with [3H]cAMP. The bound [3H]cAMP exhibited biphasic dissociation kinetics indicating that both types of cAMP binding sites were occupied. These findings suggested that the intermediate is R2C-cAMP2. This intermediate was not seen when the dialysis time was increased to 5 days, but could be observed when cAMP was added to the holoenzyme or when holoenzyme was mixed with R2cAMP4 and cAMP. The presence of two occupied cAMP binding sites on this intermediate suggests that there is minimal cooperativity between the two members of the regulatory subunit dimer, i.e. one member of the dimer binds 2 molecules of cAMP while the other binds C."

Evidence is also presented that 10% of total liver bis(5'-guanosyl)tetraphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.17) might be equally linked to mitochondria. Those data suggest that diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P3-triphosphate, diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate, or other substrates of those enzymes, might be somehow related to mitochondria or mitochondrial function(s), although the occurrence of dinucleoside polyphosphates has not been reported in that organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1605049167,"The fluorescence of (Na,K)-ATPase labeled with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein was studied under turnover conditions. At 4 degrees C the hydrolysis of ATP is slowed sufficiently to permit study of the effects of Na+, K+, and ATP on the steady-state intermediates. With Na+ and Mg2+ (Na-ATPase conditions), addition of ATP produces a 7% drop in signal that reverts back to the initial, high fluorescence after a steady state of several minutes. K-sensitive phosphoenzyme is formed under these conditions, indicating that the fluorescence signal during the steady state is associated with E2P. Under (Na,K)-ATPase conditions (Na+, K+, Mg2+), micromolar ATP produces a steady-state signal that is 25% lower than the initial fluorescence, with no detectable phosphoenzyme formed. This low-fluorescence intermediate, which is also formed by adding K+ to enzyme in the Na-ATPase steady state described above, resembles the state produced by adding K+ directly to enzyme under equilibrium conditions, i.e. E2K. The K0.5(K+) for the fluorescence decrease and for keeping the enzyme dephosphorylated are nearly identical, indicating that the fluorescence change accompanies K+-dependent dephosphorylation. High ATP increases the steady-state fluorescence during the (Na,K)-ATPase reaction; while oligomycin produces still another steady-state fluorescent intermediate. These last two intermediates may be associated with the formation of E2P and E1P, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1494938136,"Abstract In situ proteolysis of Na,K-ATPase was studied using inside-out red cell membrane vesicles. Proteolysis of the enzyme in its conformation with either trypsin or chymotrypsin inactivated cation translocation more than ATP hydrolysis. This was evident both in the absence of intravesicular alkali cations when Na-ATPase was compared to ATP-dependent 22Na+ influx, and in the presence of K+ when Na+/K+ exchange was compared to (Na+ + K+)-activated ATPase. This differential loss in pump versus hydrolysis was observed also when the activities of only intact, non-leaky vesicles were compared and therefore reflects intramolecular uncoupling rather than nonspecific leakage. Although oligomycin and thimerosal, like trypsin and chymotrypsin, inhibit the enzyme's conformational step(s), neither effect uncoupling. It is concluded that specific cleavage(s) of Na,K-ATPase, at least as it exists in situ, alters the reaction sequence with respect to the normal ordered mechanism. Accordingly, cytoplasmic Na+ and extracellular K+ bind to the enzyme, stimulate phosphorylation (ATP + E1----E1P + ADP) and dephosphorylation (E2P----E2 + Pi), respectively, but each is then released to the same side from which it had bound; presumably release occurs prior to the conformational transitions of E1P to E2P and E2 to E1. This conclusion is supported by experiments showing that, ar micromolar ATP concentration, the hydrolytic activity (Na-ATPase) of the trypsinized but not the unmodified enzyme is stimulated by K+, consistent with earlier experiments (Hegyvary, C., and Post, R. L. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5234-5240) showing that the K X E2 to K X E1 transition is slower than the E2 to E1 transition."
https://openalex.org/W1511063322,"Purine ribonucleoside monophosphates were found to inhibit chain elongation catalyzed by herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA polymerase when DNA template-primer concentrations were rate-limiting. Inhibition was fully competitive with DNA template-primer during chain elongation; however, DNA polymerase-associated exonuclease activity was inhibited noncompetitively with respect to DNA. Combinations of 5'-GMP and phosphonoformate were kinetically mutually exclusive in dual inhibitor studies. Pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates and deoxynucleoside monophosphates were less inhibitory than purine riboside monophosphates. The monophosphates of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, Virazole (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide), 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine exerted little or no inhibition. In contrast to HSV DNA polymerase, human DNA polymerase alpha was not inhibited by purine ribonucleoside monophosphates. These studies suggest the possibility of a physiological role of purine ribonucleoside monophosphates as regulators of herpesvirus DNA synthesis and a new approach to developing selective anti-herpesvirus compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1833137039,"In HeLa cells, stable mutants which are between 25-to about 200-fold resistant to the cardiac glycoside derivative SC4453 (a digoxin analog which contains a pyridazine ring in place of a lactone ring in the C-17 position) have been isolated after a single step selection in the presence of the drug. Based on their cross-resistance pattern towards various cardiac glycosides, the mutants resistant to SC4453 (SCR mutants) appear to be of two different kinds and they differ from the two classes of ouabain-resistant mutants described previously (Gupta, R. S., and Chopra, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6843-6850). One type of SCR mutants (designated as group C) exhibit a high degree of cross-resistance to all cardiac glycosides and their genins (viz. ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin, digoxigenin, convallatoxin, gitoxin, strophanthidin, and bufalin). In contrast, the second type of SCR mutant (group D) exhibit considerable resistance to only SC4453, digoxin, and digoxigenin, but showed very little or no cross-resistance to the other cardiac glycosides examined. The cross-resistance of the mutants towards cardiac glycosides was highly specific as they exhibited no cross-resistance towards a large number of other structurally and functionally related compounds (viz. ethacrynic acid, sanguinarine nitrate, penicillic acid, methyl quinolizinum bromide, 5,5'-diphenylhydantoin, deoxycorticosterone, vanadium pentoxide, and adriamycin). The cellular uptake of 86Rb in the mutant cells was found to be resistant to specific cardiac glycosides. Studies on the sensitivity of plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase to cardiac glycosides show that about 10-15% of the enzymic activity in the mutant cells was highly resistant to inhibition by the specific drugs to which the mutants exhibit increased resistance. Very interestingly, when the mutant cells are grown in cardiac glycoside-containing medium, the resistant form of the enzyme accounts for about 50-60% of the total enzyme. These results show that both classes of SCR mutants are affected in Na+/K+-ATPase and that the amount of the resistant enzyme in the mutant cells is regulated in response to cardiac glycosides."

DNA fragments containing intact alpha DNA arrays were generated by digestion of genomic DNA with restriction endonuclease that do not have sites in the alpha DNA consensus sequence. Their size was determined by Southern analysis and by sedimentation through neutral sucrose gradients followed by probing of each fraction for alpha sequences. The restriction fragments varied in size with the most frequent being 78 kilobase pairs long. We have also shown that they contain very little non-alpha DNA sequences. This suggests a minimum array of 450 tandemly repeated alpha DNA monomers, which is more than an order of magnitude larger than previously supposed."

https://openalex.org/W1510022579,"Arylsulfatase B, purified to homogeneity from human eosinophils, is a tetrameric enzyme whose activity varied in accordance with the state of association of its monomeric subunits. The rate of dissociation of oligomeric forms was slow relative to the rate of the enzymatic reaction so that the kinetic properties of the enzyme depended on the concentration of the enzyme before assay. For concentrated enzyme solutions (14 micrograms/ml), Lineweaver-Burk analysis demonstrated substrate inhibition at greater than or equal to 20 mM substrate and revealed two distinct regions of activity at low and intermediate substrate concentrations. The addition of bovine serum albumin (60 micrograms/ml) or sucrose (0.25 M), which prevent subunit dissociation, yielded a linear relationship on Lineweaver-Burk analysis at non-inhibitory substrate concentrations. For dilute enzyme concentrations (4.7 micrograms/ml), inhibition occurred at greater than or equal to 2 mM substrate. Nanomolar amounts of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), relative to millimolar concentrations of substrate, inhibited eosinophil arylsulfatase B. On Lineweaver-Burk analysis, the pattern of inhibition of LTC4 with concentrated enzyme was compatible with competitive inhibition of only one oligomeric form of the enzyme, whereas at low enzyme concentrations the pattern of inhibition was apparently competitive. These findings suggest that LTC4 is a potent competitive inhibitor of a dissociated, possibly dimeric, form of the enzyme. Nanomolar concentrations of LTC4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4 were equally inhibitory, whereas leukotriene B4 and isomeric 5,12-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids had no inhibitory activity, indicating a requirement for a thiopeptide at C-6. Thiopeptide leukotriene analogs without an intact triene structure also lacked inhibitory activity. Sulfoxide analogs of LTC4 and leukotriene D4 were potent inhibitors, although two sulfone analogs of leukotriene D4 were not inhibitory. Arylsulfatase B did not inactivate the spasmogenic activity of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes. These findings indicate that sulfidopeptide leukotrienes and their sulfoxide derivatives may regulate by competitive inhibition the activity of oligomeric forms of the eosinophil lysosomal hydrolase, arylsulfatase B."

These fragments were isolated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. They were analyzed in a qualitative manner for phosphodiesterase activity. Antibodies against these fragments were elicited in rats and tested for binding to native EcoRI in an enzyme-linked immunoassay. We conclude from these experiments that the DNA binding site of EcoRI is located in the COOH-terminal half of the molecule, close to and probably comprising amino acid residues 137 to 157. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that this sequence shows homology to the sequences of the recognition helix of other gene-regulatory proteins."
