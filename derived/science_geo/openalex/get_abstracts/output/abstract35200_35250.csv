https://openalex.org/W1970585122,"Biological processes such as transcription may generate domains of supercoiling on a circular DNA. The existence of these domains in Escherichia coli was investigated by the ability of different lengths of (CG) tracts, cloned upstream or downstream from the tetracycline resistance gene (tet) of pBR322, to adopt the Z structure in vivo. Segments as short as 12 base pairs adopt the Z form when cloned upstream from the tet gene (Eco RI site), whereas no Z DNA was detected when this sequence was cloned downstream (Sty I site), even with a 74-base pair (CG) tract that requires less supercoiling than shorter tracts for the B-Z transition. Hence the localized supercoil density in pBR322 can be as high as -0.038 and as low as -0.021 at different loci. These data demonstrate the existence of the Z structure for commonly found natural sequences and support the notion of domains of negative supercoiling in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1486851320,"Two types of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, SM1 and SM2, were recently identified to have different carboxyl termini (Nagai, R., Kuro-o, M., Babij, P., and Periasamy, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9734-9737). SM1 and SM2 are considered to be generated from a single gene through alternative RNA splicing. In this study we investigated expression of vascular MHC isoforms during development in rabbits at the mRNA, protein, and histological levels. In adults, all smooth muscle cells reacted with both anti-SM1 and anti-SM2 antibodies on immunofluorescence, suggesting the coexpression of SM1 and SM2 in a single cell. In fetal and perinatal rabbits, however, only anti-SM1 antibody consistently reacted with smooth muscles. Reactivity with anti-SM2 antibody was negative in the fetal and neonatal blood vessels and gradually increased during 30 days after birth. These developmental changes in SM1 and SM2 expression at the histological level coincided with mRNA expression of each MHC isoform as determined by S1 nuclease mapping, indicating that expression of SM1 and SM2 is controlled at the level of RNA splicing. However, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of myosin from fetal and perinatal aortas revealed the presence of large amount of SM2. Interestingly, fetal SM2 did not cross-react with our anti-SM2 antibody on immunoblotting. We conclude that expression of SM1 and SM2 are differentially regulated during development and that a third type of MHC isoform may exist in embryonic and perinatal vascular smooth muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1534324993,"The transport, accumulation, and distribution of ascorbic acid were investigated in isolated human neutrophils utilizing a new ascorbic acid assay, which combined the techniques of high performance liquid chromatography and coulometric electrochemical detection. Freshly isolated human neutrophils contained 1.0-1.4 mM ascorbic acid, which was localized greater than or equal to 94% to the cytosol, was not protein bound, and was present only as ascorbic acid and not as dehydroascorbic acid. Upon addition of ascorbic acid to the extracellular medium in physiologic amounts, ascorbic acid was accumulated in neutrophils in millimolar concentrations. Accumulation was mediated by a high affinity and a low affinity transporter; both transporters were responsible for maintenance of concentration gradients as large as 50-fold. The high affinity transporter had an apparent Km of 2-5 microns by Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee analyses, and the low affinity transporter had an apparent Km of 6-7 mM by similar analyses. Each transporter was saturable and temperature dependent. In normal human blood the high affinity transporter should be saturated, whereas the low affinity transporter should be in its linear phase of uptake."

https://openalex.org/W2156329365,"The function of villin, an actin-binding protein, has been investigated by transfecting fibroblasts with cloned human cDNAs encoding wild-type villin or functional villin domains. Synthesis of large amounts of villin induced the growth of numerous long microvilli on cell surfaces together with the redistribution of F-actin. These microvilli contained a cytoskeleton of F-actin, and their appearance was frequently accompanied by the disappearance of stress fibers. The complete villin gene sequence was required to exert its morphogenic effect. Villin lacking one actin-binding domain (113 amino acids), located at its carboxyterminal end, did not induce growth if microvilli or stress fiber disruption. Our results indicate that villin plays a key role in vivo in the morphogenesis of microvilli."

https://openalex.org/W1480358029,"Abstract Isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (IPP isomerase) is an enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway which catalyzes the interconversion of the primary five-carbon homoallylic and allylic diphosphate building blocks. We report a substantially improved procedure for purification of this enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An amino-terminal sequence (35 amino acids) was obtained from a highly purified preparation of IPP isomerase. Oligonucleotide probes based on the protein sequence were used to isolate the structural gene encoding IPP isomerase from a yeast lambda library. The cloned gene encodes a 33,350-dalton polypeptide of 288 amino acids. A 3.5-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing the gene was subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector YRp17. Upon transformation with plasmids containing the insert, a 5-6-fold increase in IPP isomerase activity was seen in transformed cells relative to YRp17 controls, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. This is the first reported isolation of the gene for IPP isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1583626782,"The solution conformation of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a small protein of 72 residues with a wide range of proinflammatory activities, has been investigated by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The 1H-NMR spectrum of IL-8 is assigned in a sequential manner and regular elements of secondary structure are identified on the basis of a qualitative interpretation of the nuclear Overhauser, coupling constant and amide exchange data. The IL-8 monomer contains a triple stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet arranged in a Greek key and a long C-terminal helix (residues 57-72). It is shown that IL-8 is a dimer in solution in which the interface is principally formed by six backbone hydrogen bonds between residues 25, 27, and 29 of one monomer and residues 29, 27, and 25, respectively, of the other. As a result, the two units of the dimer form a contiguous six-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The secondary structure of IL-8 is similar to that found in the crystal structure of the sequence related protein platelet factor 4."
https://openalex.org/W1603465668,"The mannose permease of Escherichia coli is a component of the phosphotransferase system. It transports mannose and related hexoses by a mechanism that couples sugar transport with sugar phosphorylation. It is a complex consisting of two transmembrane subunits (II-PMan and II-MMan) and a hydrophilic subunit (IIIMan). IIIMan also exists in a soluble form as dimer in the cytoplasm. Each monomer of IIIMan consists of two structurally and functionally distinct domains which are linked by a flexible hinge of the sequence KAAPAPAAAAPKAAPTPAKP. Both domains are transiently phosphorylated. The NH2-terminal domain (P13) is phosphorylated at N-3 of His-10 by the cytoplasmic phosphorylcarrier protein phospho-HPr. The COOH-terminal domain (P20) is phosphorylated by P13 at N-1 of His-175. Phosphoryltransfer occurs not only between P13 and P20 on the same IIIMan subunit but also between isolated domains and between domains on different subunits of the dimer. In the presence of the IIMan subunits, the phosphoryl group is directly transferred from His-175 of P20 to the sugar substrates of the permease. The P13 domain contains the contact sites for dimerization of IIIMan. The P20 domain contains the contact sites for interaction with the IIMan subunits. By reconstructing the ptsL gene, the two domains were expressed as individual polypeptides and the length of the hinge between P13 and P20 was changed. The in vivo and in vitro activities of mutant IIIMan were little affected by these modifications. The hinge is highly sensitive to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and its specificity for proteases can be modified by introducing the appropriate specificity determinants."

https://openalex.org/W1565505326,"The cobalt(II)-substituted human insulin hexamer has been shown to undergo the phenol-induced T6 to R6 structural transition in solution. The accompanying octahedral to tetrahedral change in ligand field geometry of the cobalt ions results in dramatic changes in the visible region of the electronic spectrum and thus represents a useful spectroscopic method for studying the T to R transition. Changes in the Co2+ spectral envelope show that the aqua ligand associated with each tetrahedral Co2+ center can be replaced by SCN-, CN-, OCN-, N3-, Cl-, and NO2-. 19F NMR experiments show that the binding of m-trifluorocresol stabilizes the R6 state of zinc insulin. The chemical shift and line broadening of the CF3 singlet, which occur due to binding, provide a useful probe of the T6 to R6 transition. Due to the appearance of new resonances in the aromatic region, the 500 MHz 1H NMR spectrum of the phenol-induced R6 hexamer is readily distinguishable from that of the T6 form. 1H NMR studies show that phenol induces the T6 to R6 transition, both in the (GlnB13)6(Zn2+)2 hexamer and in the metal-free GlnB13 species; we conclude that metal binding is not a prerequisite for formation of the R state in this mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1527528809,"Murine interleukin-3 (mIL-3) stimulates the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins in mIL-3-dependent B6SUtA1 cells. Two of these proteins, p68 and p140, are maximally phosphorylated at tyrosine residues within 2 min of addition of mIL-3. Because 125I-mIL-3 can be cross-linked to both 70- and 140-kDa proteins on intact B6SUtA1 cells, we investigated whether the tyrosine phosphorylated p68 and p140 were these two mIL-3 receptor proteins. Addition of antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (alpha PTyr Abs) to cell lysates from B6SUtA1 cells, to which 125I-mIL-3 had been disuccinimidyl suberate-cross-linked, resulted in the immunoprecipitation of 125I-mIL-3 complexed to both 70- and 140-kDa proteins. To determine if the observed immunoprecipitation pattern was due to the direct interaction of alpha-PTyr Abs with these two mIL-3 receptor proteins or with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that were associated with the receptor proteins, cell lysates were treated with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 1 min. After removal of sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol, alpha PTyr Abs immunoprecipitated 125I-mIL-3 cross-linked to only the 140-kDa protein. To confirm this finding, 32P-labeled B6SUtA1 cells were treated with biotinylated or fluoresceinated mIL-3. Addition of immobilized streptavidin or antifluorescein antibodies, respectively, to cell lysates from these cells resulted in the enrichment of only a 140-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that only the 140-kDa receptor protein is tyrosine phosphorylated upon mIL-3 binding."
https://openalex.org/W1543542376,"The tau and gamma subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli were each isolated in large quantities as oligomers from overproducing cells in which their genes (dnaZ and X) were under the control of a T7 phage promoter. The 52-kDa gamma subunit (encoded by the dnaZ sequence) contains three-forths of the N-terminal residues of the 71-kDa tau subunit (encoded by the dnaX sequence). Both gamma and tau share a binding site for ATP (or dATP). A DNA-dependent ATPase activity (Lee, S.H., and Walker, J.R. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 2713-2717) exhibited only by the tau subunit, presumably requires a DNA-binding site in the C-terminal domain lacking in the gamma subunit. Among ATPases dependent on single-stranded DNA, the tau activity is remarkable in the failure of homopolymers (e.g. poly(dA) or poly(dT)) to replace natural DNAs. The presumed need for certain secondary structures may reflect a feature of template binding in the crucial contribution that tau makes to the high processivity of polymerase III holoenzyme. Limited tryptic digestion of tau generates a fragment that resembles gamma in: (i) size, (ii) binding of ATP without ATPase activity, and (iii) a level of complementing holoenzyme activity in extracts of dnaZ-mutant cells that is higher than that of tau."
https://openalex.org/W1586636297,"Abstract Nuclei rapidly purified from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a cytochalasin B enucleation procedure are substantially free of cell wall, secretory vesicle, plasma membrane vacuolar, and cytoplasmic and mitochondrial contamination. Nuclei obtained in this manner in high yield retain transport properties comparable to nuclei in situ. An in vitro nuclear import assay system has been developed using isolated nuclei and radiolabeled proteins prepared by a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system. Both wild-type SV40 large T-antigen and nucleoplasmin are imported into isolated yeast nuclei, whereas a missense cytoplasmic mutant of the SV40 large T-antigen (Lys128----Thr) and cytoplasmic dihydrofolate reductase are not imported. Association and import of these proteins in a time- and signal-dependent manner resulted in their protection from trypsin that was tethered to agarose beads. Greater than 70% of the labeled protein harboring a karyophilic signal was imported in a reaction that could be blocked by prior treatment of nuclei with trypsin-agarose. Nuclear accumulation of SV40 large T-antigen and nucleoplasmin was unidirectional, ATP and Ca2+ dependent, and was not inhibited by a vast excess of exogenous nonnuclear competitor protein. This system provides an important new tool in combination with powerful yeast genetic methods for analysis of the mechanism and the apparatus for transport at the nuclear envelope."
https://openalex.org/W1889171976,"Abstract By using acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two cationic proteins were found in the isolated outer membranes of Salmonella typhimurium SH5014. Also, all the other enterobacterial strains studied (five additional strains of S. typhimurium, one strain of Salmonella minnesota, and three strains of Escherichia coli K12) had those proteins. The most abundant (OMB2) was purified in preparative acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). It had a molecular mass of 16 kDa, a pI above 10.0, and was rich in arginine and lysine. 72% of the total amino acid sequence was determined by sequencing several HPLC-purified proteolytic fragments and 55 amino acids from the NH2 terminus. Furthermore, we isolated by molecular cloning the corresponding gene, named it ompH, and determined its nucleotide sequence. By combining protein and nucleotide sequence data, we determined the primary structure of the entire OmpH protein. It consists of 141 amino acids, possesses regions very rich in basic amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 15,862 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1484780252,"Fatty acid synthase of animal tissue is a multifunctional enzyme comprised of two identical subunits, each containing seven partial activities and a site for the prosthetic group, 4'-phosphopantetheine (acyl carrier protein). We have recently isolated cDNA clones of chicken fatty acid synthase coding for the dehydratase, enoyl reductase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase domains (Chirala, S.S., Kasturi, R., Pazirandeh, M., Stolow, D.T., Huang, W.Y., and Wakil, S.J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3750-3757). To gain insight into the structure and function of the various domains, the portion of the cDNA coding for the acyl carrier protein and thioesterase domains was expressed in Escherichia coli by using an expression vector that utilizes the phage lambda PL promoter. The recombinant protein was efficiently expressed and purified to near homogeneity using anion-exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography. As expected from the coding capacity of the cDNA expressed, the protein has a molecular weight of 43,000 and reacts with antithioesterase antibodies. The recombinant thioesterase was found to be enzymatically active and has the same substrate specificity and kinetic properties as the native enzyme of the multifunctional synthase. Treatment of the recombinant protein with alpha-chymotrypsin results in the cleavage of the acyl carrier protein and thioesterase domain junction sequence at exactly the same site as with native fatty acid synthase. The amino acid composition of the purified recombinant protein revealed the presence of 0.6 mol of beta-alanine/mol of protein, indicating partial pantothenylation of the recombinant acyl carrier protein domain. These results indicate that the expressed protein has a conformation similar to the native enzyme and that its folding into functionally active domains is independent of the remaining domains of the multifunctional synthase subunit. These conclusions are consistent with the proposal that the multifunctional synthase gene has evolved from fusion of component genes."
https://openalex.org/W1596354403,"Normal and mutated cDNAs of Ha-ras have each been cloned into a standard (pAc373) and a novel (p36C) baculovirus transfer vector and introduced via homologous recombination into the genome of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus immediately downstream of the polyhedrin promoter. Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with recombinant virus containing the normal Ha-ras gene express very high levels of ras p21 protein (approximately 20% of total cell protein), whereas the mutant protein was expressed at considerably lower levels. Molecular analysis showed that this was most likely due to a post-transcriptional event. The expression vector p36C produced considerably higher levels of recombinant p21 compared to the more commonly used pAc373. The majority of the normal ras p21 protein is soluble, cytoplasmic, and appears to be nonacylated. However, about 10% of the p21 associates with the membrane fraction of infected cells and migrates as a slightly faster band on gels. Furthermore, this band is sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment and shows specific incorporation of [3H]palmitate, strongly suggesting that it is the palmitoylated form of p21, which is the biologically active form of the protein. Both the soluble and membrane-associated p21 have been purified to homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions, the latter in the presence of detergents. The isolation of native palmitoylated p21 has not been reported previously. The difference in hydrophobicity between these two proteins has been demonstrated by Triton X-114 partitioning. The use of the insect/baculovirus expression system to express relatively high levels (20 mg/liter) of palmitoylated p21 should aid experiments to resolve the structural and functional properties of this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1598024033,"It has been suggested that mouse and rat lack adenosine deaminase-complexing protein because in these species exclusively the small molecular weight form of adenosine deaminase (ADA-S) is found. This suggestion is based on the assumption that the adenosine deaminase binding capacity is an inherent functional characteristic of adenosine deaminase-complexing protein. We report on the presence of adenosine deaminase-complexing protein immunoreactivity in mouse and rat determined with a species cross-reactive polyclonal anti-adenosine deaminase-complexing protein serum. In the mouse the tissue and subcellular distribution and the electrophoretic mobility in starch and polyacrylamide gels of the protein correspond with those of adenosine deaminase-complexing protein, but it does not bind the small molecular weight form of adenosine deaminase. Furthermore, in human, mouse, and rat kidney cortex adenosine deaminase and adenosine deaminase-complexing protein did not colocalize by immunohistochemistry. It is suggested that the function of adenosine deaminase-complexing protein is not adenosine deaminase-related."
https://openalex.org/W1597433573,"Pseudomonas mevalonii (formerly designated Pseudomonas sp. M (Beach, M. J., and Rodwell, V. W. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 2994-3001; Gill, J. F., Jr., Beach, M.J., and Rodwell, V. W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9393-9398] 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.88), overexpressed in Escherichia coli (1), has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity in 75% yield (final specific activity 48 µmols of NAD+ reduced per min/mg protein). The enzyme catalyzes its normal catabolic reaction (mevalonate + 2 NAD+ + CoASH→HMG-CoA + 2NADH + 2H+), the reverse reaction (HMG-CoA + ZNADH + 2H+ → mevalonate + 2NAD+ + CoASH), and two half-reactions which involve mevaldehyde, the postulated intermediate in the aforementioned reactions (mevaldehyde + NAD+ + CoASH → HMG-CoA + NADH + H+, and mevaldehyde + NADH + H+ → mevalonate + NAD+). The rates of all four reactions and the Michaelis constants for all substrates were measured. Coenzyme A decreased the KM for mevaldehyde reduction 12-fold and stimulated Vmax 2-3 fold. CoASH thus may remain bound throughout the catalytic cycle. Dithiothreitol and analogs of CoASH were tested for their ability to reproduce the CoASH stimulation. Pantetheine, but not dithiothreitol, pantothenate, or desulfo-CoA mimicked CoASH stimulation. Titration with 5,5‵-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) indicated two sulfhydryl groups per subunit. Both groups remained accessible to 5,5‵-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of mevalonate and/or NAD+ but only one group in the presence of HMG-CoA. N-Ethylmaleimide inhibited all the aforementioned reactions. HMG-CoA, but not mevalonate, afforded protection from N-ethylmaleimide inactivation. Methyl methanethiosulfonate completely and irreversibly inactivated the enzyme. The reactive sulfhydryl group thus may not be a catalytic residue, butm ay be involved in a conformational change."

https://openalex.org/W1507410514,"The mechanism of yeast ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) regulation in response to polyamines was examined. ODC catalyzes the first step of polyamine biosynthesis, the conversion of ornithine to putrescine. ODC activity was modulated approximately 200-fold by varying the availability of polyamines. Variations in ODC activity were associated with parallel changes in the amount of active enzyme molecules. Regulation of ODC activity did not appear to be mediated by changes in the stability of the enzyme. The half-life of ODC was approximately 75 min and was unaffected by the availability of polyamines. Polyamines had no demonstrable effect on the transcriptional or translational stages of ODC expression. The amount of ODC mRNA and the number of ribosomes associated with the mRNA were constant despite the variations in ODC activity. Unlike translationally controlled genes, the regulation of ODC expression did not require either the 5′- or the 3′-untranslated regions of the ODC gene transcript. While gene dosage experiments indicated that negative trans-acting factors are involved in control of ODC expression, these implied factors did not appear to affect translation of ODC mRNA. The results are interpreted to suggest that polyamines regulate ODC expression at a post-translational step prior to assembly of the active form of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2111554971,"We have established an in vitro reaction in which heteroduplex DNA formation is dependent on the concerted actions of recA and recBCD proteins, the major components of the recBCD pathway of genetic recombination in vivo. We find that heteroduplex DNA formation requires three distinct enzymatic functions: first, the helicase activity of recBCD enzyme initiates heteroduplex DNA formation by unwinding the linear double-stranded DNA molecule to transiently form single-stranded DNA (ssDNA); second, recA protein traps this ssDNA before it reanneals; third, recA protein catalyzes the pairing of this ssDNA molecule with another homologous ssDNA molecule, followed by the renaturation of these molecules to form heteroduplex DNA. The first two functions should be important to all in vitro reactions involving recA and recBCD proteins, whereas the third will be specific to the DNA substrates used. The rate-limiting step of heteroduplex DNA formation is the trapping by recA protein of the ssDNA produced by recBCD enzyme. A model for this reaction is described."
https://openalex.org/W1530476228,"Nine mutant thymidylate synthases were isolated that only differed in sequence at position 147. The wild-type enzyme (which had a histidine residue at 147) and mutant enzymes were purified to near homogeneity and their kinetic properties were compared. Although the kcat values for the mutant enzymes were 10-10,000-fold lower than for the wild-type enzyme, the Km values for both 2′-deoxyuridylate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate were nearly identical for all the enzymes indicating that His-147 is not significantly involved in initial substrate binding. By comparing the wild-type (His-147) to the glycine (Gly-147) enzyme, the side chain of His-147 was estimated to lower the activation energy of the catalytic step by 1.6-2.9 kcal mol−1. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the activity of the Gly-147 enzyme decreased when the pH was raised above 7.5. The activity loss coincided with the deprotonation of a residue that had a pKa of 9.46 ± 0.2 and an enthalpy of ionization (Δ Hion) of 12.1 ± 0.9. These values are consistent with the involvement of a lysine or an arginine residue in the catalytic process. An inspection of the rates of ternary complex formation among enzyme, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridylate, and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for the mutant enzymes indicated that His-147 is not needed for the proton removal from C-5 of 2′-deoxyuridylate but rather participates in an initial catalytic step and alters the pKa value of a catalytically important lysine or arginine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1601888542,"We have assayed several methods to quantitatively recover yeast histone acetyltransferases in an attempt to study the multiplicity of enzymatic activities. Two methods, namely (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and salt dissociation of chromatin in 0.5 M NaCl, yielded convenient preparations of total histone acetyltransferases. DEAE-Sepharose chromatography of the crude extracts resulted in the separation of three peaks of activity when total yeast histones were used as substrate. However, the scanning of the enzymatic activity toward individual histones along the chromatography, achieved by determining the specific activity of the individual histones after incubating whole histones and [14C]acetyl-CoA with the chromatographic fractions, yielded four peaks. The first two peaks showed specificity toward H2B and H3, respectively. Although they partially overlapped, rechromatography on cation exchangers allowed us to resolve the two activities, and several criteria were used to prove that they correspond to different enzyme molecules. The last two peaks were H4-specific, but the present data suggest that one of the activities is chromatin-bound, whereas the other surely corresponds to the cytoplasmic B-form of the enzyme. The enzyme specific for yeast H2B acetylates chicken erythrocyte H2A, rather than H2B. The detected multiplicity of yeast histone acetyltransferases may correspond to the multiplicity of roles proposed for histone acetylation."

https://openalex.org/W1534882186,"Abstract An analog of alpha-factor, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tridecapeptide mating pheromone (Trp-His-Trp-Leu-Gln-Leu-Lys-Pro-Gly-Gln-Pro-Met-Tyr), in which the side chains of Lys7 and Gln10 were covalently linked, was synthesized using solid phase methodologies. The yield of the purified cyclic analog cyclo7,10[Nle12]alpha-factor was 30%, and its structure was verified by amino acid analysis, peptide sequencing, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Cyclo7,10[Nle12]alpha-factor caused growth arrest and morphological alterations in S. cerevisiae MATa cells qualitatively identical to those induced by linear pheromone and was one-fourth to one-twentieth as active as the linear alpha-factor depending upon the S. cerevisiae strain tested. Consistent with the relative activities of the linear and cyclic peptides, binding competition studies indicated that cyclo7,10[Nle12]alpha-factor had approximately 20-40-fold less affinity for the alpha-factor receptor. Hydrolysis of the cyclic peptide by the target cells did not lead to opening of the ring and was less rapid than that of linear alpha-factor. The alpha-factor antagonist des-Trp1-[Ala3,Nle12]alpha-factor reversed the activity of the cyclic analog, and cyclo7,10[Nle12]alpha-factor was not active at the restrictive temperature in a temperature-sensitive receptor mutant. These results support the conclusion that the cyclic alpha-factor occupies the same binding site within the receptor as is occupied by the natural pheromone. The cyclic alpha-factor represents a rare example of an agonist among covalently constrained congeners of small linear peptide messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1581618630,"Eight eukaryotic promoters have been tested for their activity in vivo in Escherichia coli. The rat beta-actin, rat amylase, rat chymotrypsin B, mouse metallothionein I, rat insulin I, human insulin, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR) and hepatitis B viral precore promoter activities were measured by using the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequences as the reporter function and by primer extension RNA analysis. All eight promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs produce chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity with the following relative strengths: RSV LTR greater than rat beta-actin greater than rat insulin I greater than rat amylase greater than hepatitis B virus precore greater than human insulin greater than rat chymotrypsin B greater than mouse metallothionein I. A primer extension analysis indicates that transcription from the RSV LTR, rat insulin I, and rat beta-actin promoters initiates at the sites expected for eukaryotic rather than prokaryotic promoters. Thus the site of initiation is determined by the DNA sequence rather than by the RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1780796416,"Abstract A partial cDNA clone corresponding to the iron-sulfur protein of succinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.1) has been isolated by an application of the polymerase chain reaction (Gould, S. J., Subramani, S., and Scheffler, I. E. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 1934-1938). We used this clone for targeted gene disruption to isolate clones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which were totally defective in this enzyme. The disruption of the gene was verified by Southern analysis. A Northern analysis revealed the existence of a new transcript which includes the 5' end of the mRNA for the IP subunit, but extends into the vector sequence disrupting the gene. A Western analysis suggests that the large flavoprotein subunit (FP) is still made in the mutant and imported into the mitochondria, but at significantly lower levels."
https://openalex.org/W1507149010,"The upstream region of the Escherichia coli rnd gene has been analyzed. A single promoter and transcription start site were identified in the 170-nucleotide upstream region of the clone based on deletion analysis, nuclease S1 mapping, primer extension, and quantitative dot-blots. The start site of transcription is 70 nucleotides upstream of the UUG initiation codon of the RNase D coding region. Between the RNA initiation site and the coding region is a GC-rich hairpin structure followed by 8 T residues that looks like a rho-independent transcription terminator. Surprisingly, deletion of the hairpin structure elevates rnd mRNA levels only slightly (less than 2-fold), but it dramatically decreases RNase D expression (greater than 95%), measured both by activity and immunoblotting. No evidence for an effect on mRNA stability or processing was observed. The uncommon UUG translation initiation codon was converted to AUG by site-directed mutagenesis. This alteration led to an 11-fold elevation of RNase D expression in single-copy plasmids. These data indicate that RNase D expression is negatively regulated at the translational level by the initiation codon, and that an upstream structure (or sequence) also influences translation of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1512385273,"A cytosolic receptor protein for oxygenated sterols, postulated to be involved in the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol biosynthesis, has been purified from mouse L cell cytosol greater than 3,600-fold in its undenatured form and to apparent homogeneity upon further electrophoresis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified 7.5 S receptor appears to be a dimer with similar or identical subunits of Mr 95,000. Proteolytic cleavage by an endogenous factor(s) gives rise to a 4.2 S form of the receptor which is resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into a heterogeneous mixture of ligand binding fragments of Mr 30,000-60,000. This 4.2 S form of the receptor retains high affinity for the oxysterol ligand and exhibits a more rapid oxysterol binding rate than the 7.5 S form. The 7.5 S form of the receptor binds to DNA-cellulose at low salt concentrations at neutral pH, and its affinity increases at low pH or in the presence of Zn2+. Receptor preparations from mouse liver were purified approximately 900-fold by the same purification procedure, but this was accompanied by conversion of the 7.5 S liver receptor to a approximately 4 S form, Mr approximately 55,000."
https://openalex.org/W1512968983,"Each of the four identical subunits of Pseudomonas mevalonii 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase contains two cysteine residues, Cys156 and Cys296 (Beach, M. J., and Rodwell, V. W. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 2994-3001). Both are accessible to modification by sulfhydryl reagents under nondenaturing conditions (Jordan-Starck, T. C., and Rodwell, V. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17913-17918). We used site-directed mutagenesis to construct three mutant enzymes in which alanine replaced either or both cysteine residues. Mutant enzymes C156A, C296A, and C156/296A were over-expressed in Escherichia coli and were found to be fully active. Following their purification, all four forms of the enzyme were compared with respect to their catalytic efficiency, their affinities for the substrates of all four catalyzed reactions, and for their sensitivity to inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents. Replacement of cysteine residues with alanine residues had no major effect on either the specific activity or the affinity of the enzymes for any substrate. The mutants catalyzed all four HMG-CoA reductase reactions as efficiently as did the wild-type enzyme, and coenzyme A stimulated mevaldehyde reduction to the same extent as for wild-type HMG-CoA reductase. Mutant C156A and the cysteine-free mutant C156/296A were not inactivated by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate). By contrast, mutant C296A was inactivated to the same extent as was the wild-type enzyme. Following treatment of the mutant enzymes with N-ethylmaleimide, the four reductase reactions catalyzed by mutant C296A were inactivated to the same extent as for the wild-type enzyme. Neither mutant C156A nor C156/296A was affected by this reagent. We conclude that the sulfhydryl reagent-reactive group whose derivatization leads to loss of enzymatic activity is Cys156. However, this residue is not an essential active site residue since neither substrate binding nor catalysis was affected when it was replaced by alanine. Possible roles of cysteine in maintaining structural stability are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1502225295,"Incubation of homogeneous preparations of L-threonine dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli with 2,3-butanedione, 2,3-pentanedione, phenylglyoxal, or 1,2-cyclohexanedione causes a time- and concentration-dependent loss of enzymatic activity; plots of log percent activity remaining versus time are linear to greater than 90% inactivation, indicative of pseudo-first order inactivation kinetics. The reaction order with respect to the concentration of modifying reagent is approximately 1.0 in each case suggesting that the loss of catalytic activity is due to one molecule of modifier reacting with each active unit of enzyme. Controls establish that this inactivation is not due to modifier-induced dissociation or photoinduced nonspecific alteration of the dehydrogenase. Essentially the same Km but decreased Vmax values are obtained when partially inactivated enzyme is compared with native. NADH (25 mM) and NAD+ (70 mM) give full protection against inactivation whereas much higher concentrations (i.e. 150 mM) of L-threonine or L-threonine amide provide a maximum of 80-85% protection. Amino acid analyses coupled with quantitative sulfhydryl group determinations show that enzyme inactivated 95% by 2,3-butanedione loses 7.5 arginine residues (out of 16 total)/enzyme subunit with no significant change in other amino acid residues. In contrast, only 2.4 arginine residues/subunit are modified in the presence of 80 mM NAD+. Analysis of the course of modification and inactivation by the statistical method of Tsou (Tsou, C.-L. (1962) Sci. Sin. 11, 1535-1558) demonstrates that inactivation of threonine dehydrogenase correlates with the loss of 1 essential arginine residue/subunit which quite likely is located in the NAD+/NADH binding site."

This represents one of the first Fab-protein antigen complexes in which the same Fab fragment has previously been crystallized in the uncomplexed state and the structure solved (Prasad, L., Vandonselaar, M., Lee, J. S., and Delbaere, L. T. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2571-2574). Single crystals up to 0.25 x 0.50 x 0.05 mm in size were grown by the technique of washing and reseeding. The space group is C2, with unit cell dimensions a = 130.0, b = 68.1, and c = 77.6 A; beta = 97.3 degrees; and Z = 4. There is one Fab-histidine-containing protein complex/asymmetric unit, and the solvent content is estimated to be 57%."
