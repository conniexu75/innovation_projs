The first, due to microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide, initiates transcription of the cytokine genes and accumulation of the precursor proteins. Cleavage and secretion of the cytokines is mediated by caspase-1, in association with an inflammasome containing Nalp3, which can be activated by binding of extracellular ATP to purinergic receptors. We show that treatment of macrophages with ATP results in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and subsequent Akt and ERK1/2 activation. ROS exerts its effect through glutathionylation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10), whose inactivation would shift the equilibrium in favor of PI3K. ATP-dependent ROS production and PI3K activation also stimulate transcription of genes required for an oxidative stress response. In parallel, ATP-mediated ROS-dependent PI3K is required for activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. Thus, an increase in ROS levels in ATP-treated macrophages results in activation of a single pathway that promotes both adaptation to subsequent exposure to oxidants or inflammation, and processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.

The inflammatory mediator, extracellular ATP, binds to P2 purinergic receptors that are expressed on a wide spectrum of cell types, including macrophages and epithelial cells (1Burnstock G. Knight G.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2004; 240: 31-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The P2 receptors can be classified into two families, the P2X ligandgated cation channels and the G protein-coupled P2Y receptors. The only known physiological ligand for P2X receptors is extracellular ATP, whereas remaining P2Y receptors can interact with ATP and other nucleotides such as UTP, UDP, and ADP (1Burnstock G. Knight G.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2004; 240: 31-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). P2X7 plays a key role in cells from the immune system. Depending on the cell type, treatment with ATP leads to permeabilization of the plasma membrane, cell death, cell proliferation, shedding of cell-adhesion molecules, killing of intracellular pathogens, and secretion of mature IL-1β 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; BzATP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium chloride; iPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; Nox, NADPH oxidase complex; oxATP, periodate-oxidized ATP; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Ab, antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GCL, glutamate cysteine ligase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. and IL-18 (2Ferrari D.

Whereas the pathways leading from P2X7 ligation to the different cell responses remain to be characterized in most cases, ATP has been shown to activate various cell signaling mediators, including ERK1/2, PI3K, calcium fluxes, and p38 MAP kinases (5Gendron F.P.

The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 play an important role in fever, septic shock, and inflammatory disease (9Dinarello C.A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 83: 447S-455SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In macrophages, their production and secretion are therefore tightly controlled, requiring typically two separate signals (10Lich J.D. Arthur J.C. Ting J.P.-Y. Immunity. 2006; 24: 241-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Priming of macrophages with pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS is sufficient to stimulate synthesis of pro-IL-1β, but secretion of the mature cytokine requires its cleavage by caspase-1. Caspase-1, in turn, is expressed constitutively as an inactive pro-caspase-1. Cleavage and activation of caspase-1 takes place in association with protein complexes termed inflammasomes, of which there are two types. The inflammasome that is activated after P2X7 ligation contains the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), cardinal, and the NOD-like receptor family member, Nalp3 (also known as cryopyrin). The Nalp3 inflammasome can be activated by “danger signals” (danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMP) released from stressed or infected eucaryotic cells, such as ATP or uric acid crystals (10Lich J.D. Arthur J.C. Ting J.P.-Y. Immunity. 2006; 24: 241-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), which by themselves do not promote synthesis of the cytokines. LPS priming can increase the efficiency of ATP-mediated caspase-1 activation, but is not required (12Yamamoto M. Yaginuma K. Tsutsui H. Sagara J. Guan X. Seki E. Yasuda K. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Nakanishi K. Noda T. Taniguchi S. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Thus, a pathogen must both express a pathogen-associated molecular pattern capable of driving cytokine synthesis, and be viewed as potentially dangerous to the host organism, for mature IL-1β and IL-18 to be secreted efficiently. P2X7 ligation can lead to pore formation and cytosolic K+ depletion, and depleting K+ with ionophores without extracellular ATP treatment results in activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in macrophages that had been primed with LPS (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M. Curti A. Idzko M. Panther E. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 10Lich J.D. Arthur J.C. Ting J.P.-Y. Immunity. 2006; 24: 241-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Several pathogens that produce toxins that promote host-cell K+ efflux can also activate the inflammasome, in the absence of a second signal from danger-associated molecular patterns. It was thus proposed that K+ depletion, which may be detected by Nalp3, may be a common mechanism used by different danger-associated molecular patterns and pathogens to activate the inflammasome (11Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 14Mariathasan S. Weiss D.S. Newton K. McBride J. O'Rourke K. Roose-Girma M. Lee W.P. Weinrauch Y. Monack D.M. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2006; 440: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, K+ effluxes have not been reported in cells stimulated with uric acid crystals, which must be endocytosed to activate the inflammasome (15Martinon F. Petrilli V. Mayor A. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Nature. 2006; 440: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar), and some pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as peptidoglycan and bacterial mRNA may activate the Nalp3 inflammasome after being detected in the cytosol, making it likely that a decrease in cytosolic K+ concentrations may have its effect on Nalp3 indirectly (10Lich J.D. Arthur J.C. Ting J.P.-Y. Immunity. 2006; 24: 241-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), or macrophages may also use other pathways to transmit signals from danger-associated molecular patterns such as ATP to the inflammasome. We have therefore addressed the possibility that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced after ATP treatment of primary macrophages may stimulate caspase-1 activation and processing of IL-1β and IL-18. The production of ROS such as H2O2 was long considered as an undesirable consequence of aerobic respiration, being associated with diseases as diverse as aging, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease (16Tabner B.J. El-Agnaf O.M. German M.J. Fullwood N.J. Allsop D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, however, it has become clear that H2O2 is also a physiological mediator in cell signaling pathways involved in differentiation, proliferation, migration, and cytokine secretion (17Rhee S.G. Science. 2006; 312: 1882-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 18Forman H.J. Torres M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 166: S4-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Significantly, an ROS response in psychologically stressed mice leads to caspase-1 activation, secretion of IL-1β, and up-regulation of plasma IL-18 (19Sekiyama A. Ueda H. Kashiwamura S.-i. Sekiyama R. Takeda M. Rokutan K. Okamura H. Immunity. 2005; 22: 669-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given the ability of ROS to activate PI3K and ERK1/2 (20Qin S. Chock P.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2995-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Lee S.B. Cho E.S. Yang H.S. Kim H. Um H.D. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether ATP-dependent ROS production could activate PI3K and its downstream mediators. We found that in addition to activating PI3K, probably by inactivating PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) through glutathionylation, ATP-mediated ROS production can activate ERK1/2 and, subsequently, caspase-1, which is required for IL-1β and IL-18 processing. In parallel, the PI3K pathway is involved in stimulating transcription of genes involved in glutathione synthesis and an oxidative stress response. Cells and Reagents—ADP, ATP, BzATP, oxATP, UTP, LY-294002, wortmannin, and diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) were purchased from Sigma, whereas PD98059 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Z-YVAD-fmk was from Biovision (Mountain View, CA). The antibodies used for Western blotting were anti-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-rabbit p44/p42 and anti-p38 (Tyr(P)180/182), pAKT (Thr308), from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and Akt1 (C-20), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The alveolar macrophages, NR8383, were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats (22Helmke R.J. Boyd R.L. German V.F. Mangos J.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1987; 23: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). NR8383 macrophages were maintained in F-12K medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Measurement of ROS Production by FACS and Fluorescence Microscopy—NR8383 cells were treated with different agonists and inhibitors followed by addition of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by FACS with a Guava EasyCyte (Hayward, CA) or a Leica epifluorescence microscope (Mannheim, Germany) at 500 nm. Immunoblotting for Akt and ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—Proteins from lysed cells were analyzed on a SDS-PAGE 4–20% gel (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in TBST. The membrane was incubated overnight at –4 °C with specific antibodies and then incubated again with the corresponding conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Intracellular Staining for ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—NR8383 cells were pretreated with different agonists or inhibitors and centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold methanol and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were rinsed with incubation buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in incubation buffer with the primary Ab. After rinsing, the samples were treated for 30 min with the secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The samples were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by FACS with the Guava EasyCyte. Immunoprecipitation for PTEN Glutathionylation—Ten million NR8383 cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm GSH, 10 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 0.5% Nonidet-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 ng/ml leupeptin, and 10 ng/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4. The lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the proteins were collected. Five hundred micrograms of protein was incubated with anti-PTEN Ab overnight at –4 °C. The bond complex was washed with cold lysis buffer, and 40 μl of the immunoprecipitated complex was loaded on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, the proteins were revealed with Ab against PTEN (Santa Cruz; dilution 1:1000) or GSH-protein complexes (Virogen, Watertown, MA). Measurement of gcl and Cytokine Gene Expression—NR8383 cells were cultured in 60-mm Petri dishes and pretreated for 30 min with PD98059 (10 μm), LY294002 (50 μm), or wortmannin (100 nm), followed by ATP (3 mm), BzATP (1 mm), UTP (1 mm), ADP (0.4 mm), or control buffer for 5 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 600 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. When the cells were pretreated with oxATP (0.3 mm), the time of incubation was 2 h. After centrifuging the cells, the RNA extraction was performed with RNEasy Minikit (250) from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions, with an additional step where 1 unit/μl of RNase-free DNase (Fisher, Lafayette, CO) was added for 15 min after cell lysis. The reverse transcriptase assay was performed using TaqMan-Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA) with a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction cycle was performed on a Eppendorf Termocycler for 45 min (25 °C for 10 min; 48 °C for 30 min; 95 °C for 5 min). Approximately 1 μg of cDNA was used for a real-time PCR using primers specific for gclc and gclm. The reaction was performed using SYBR Green Jump Start™, Taq Ready Mix™ for quantitative PCR (Sigma). The reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on a ×3000 Stratagene Thermocycler with a pre-heating cycle for 10 min at 95 °C and 50 cycles, then 95 °C for 25 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 70 °C for 40 s. The sequences of the gclc primers were: 5′-ATGGAGGTACAGTTGACAGAC-3′, sense; and 5′-ACGGCGTTGCCACCTTTGCA-3′, antisense. For gclm, the primers were: 5′-GCTGTACCAGTGGGCACAG-3′, sense; and 5′-GGCTTCAATGTCAGGGATGC-3′, antisense. The il-18 primers were: 5′-ATATCGACCGAACAGCCAAC-3′, sense; and 3′-TAGGGTCACAGCCAGTCCTC-5′, antisense. As a control gene, we used gapdh: 5′-ACCCCCAATGTATCCGTTGT-3′, sense; and 5′-TACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT-3′, antisense. Measurement of Caspase-1 Activity by FACS—Caspase-1 activity was measured in NR8383 cells using a caspase assay kit, carboxyfluorescein Flica (Immunochemistry Technologies, Bloomington, MN). In brief, 106 cells were incubated with different agonists or inhibitors followed by addition of the caspase-1 fluorigenic substrate, FAM-VAD-fmk (20 μm). As a control for specificity, cells were also incubated with the caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-fmk, before adding FAM-VAD-fmk. Fluorescence was measured using the Guava EasyCite. Quantification of Cytokine Release—Ten million NR8383 cells were primed with 1 μg/ml LPS for 2 h at 37°C, and then treated with 2 μm DPI for 10 min, 50 μm Z-YVAD-fmk for 30 min, or LY294002 for 10 min. Finally, the cells were stimulated with 3 mm ATP or control buffer for 6 h. The cells were then spun down and the supernatant collected. The ELISA analysis of the supernatant was performed following the manufacturer's protocol for IL-18 (BIOSOURCE, Carlsbad, CA) and IL-1β (Pierce Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad InsTat software (GraphPad Software Inc., version 4.0) by Tukey test and was considered significant at p < 0.05. Extracellular ATP Induces ROS Production in Primary Macrophages—Stimulation of primary rat microglia with the P2X7 agonist, BzATP, leads to release of large amounts of superoxide (23Parvathenani L.K. Tertyshnikova S. Greco C.R. Roberts S.B. Robertson B. Posmantur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13309-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To determine whether stimulation of primary alveolar macrophages with ATP may also result in production of ROS, macrophages were preincubated with the ROS-sensitive dye, DCF, before treating with 3 mm ATP for 5 min. ATP treatment caused the fluorescence of DCF to increase dramatically, as measured by FACS, compared with background controls (Fig. 1A). A comparable increase in fluorescence was achieved by treating macrophages with 1 mm H2O2, and the ATP-induced increase in ROS levels could be inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (Fig. 1A). ATP-induced ROS production was also confirmed by viewing ATP-treated macrophages by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the increase in ROS levels was transient. By FACS, ROS production was detectable within 0.5 min of ATP stimulation, rose to maximal levels within 5 min, and subsided to basal levels by 15 min (Fig. 1C). Ligation of P2X7 and Other Purinergic Receptors Leads to ROS Production—Besides expressing the purinergic receptor, P2X7, rat alveolar macrophages express other purinergic receptors, which can be stimulated by ATP, ADP, and UTP (24Bowler J.W. Bailey R.J. North R.A. Surprenant A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Zhang G.H. Helmke R.J. Mork A.C. Martinez J.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All of these nucleotides, including UDP, can promote high levels of ROS production (Fig. 2A). At least part of the ATP-mediated response is due to the P2X7 receptor, as it can be blocked partially by pretreatment with the irreversible P2X7 antagonist, oxATP, and can be stimulated with the P2X7 agonist, BzATP (26North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, B and C). As incubation with extracellular ADP, UDP, and UTP can also induce ROS production, these results suggest that ligation of P2X7 ligation and other purinergic receptors, possibly P2X4, P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y6, or P2Y12 (24Bowler J.W. Bailey R.J. North R.A. Surprenant A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), can all lead to activation of enzymes that result in ROS production. Ligation of Purinergic Receptors Leads to Activation of the PI3K Pathway—Extracellular ATP can activate PI3K in macrophages and other cell types (6Auger R. Motta I. Benihoud K. Ojcius D.M.

In many cell types, PI3K phosphorylates and activates the downstream Ser/Thr kinase, Akt/PKB, which promotes survival or controls metabolism through phosphorylation of multiple targets (28Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Although oxidants are known to stimulate the PI3K/Akt pathway (29Zhuang S. Kochevar I.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Klotz L.O. Schieke S.M. Sies H. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the mechanism linking P2 receptor ligation with PI3K activation had not been elucidated. We therefore explored the possibility that ATP-mediated ROS production could activate the PI3K pathway in alveolar macrophages, by measuring phosphorylation of Akt by immunoblots using Ab against a phosphorylated residue of Akt (residue Thr308) that leads to Akt activation in different cell types. As shown in Fig. 3, a short incubation of macrophages with ATP caused Akt phosphorylation to increase significantly, consistent with previous reports in macrophages and astrocytes (8da Cruz C.M. Ventura A.L. Schachter J. Costa-Junior H.M. da Silva Souza H.A. Gomes F.R. Coutinho-Silva R. Ojcius D.M. Persechini P.M. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 1106-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The increase in Akt phosphorylation could be inhibited by co-treatment of macrophages with NAC (Fig. 3, lane 3), suggesting that ATP-induced ROS production leads to Akt phosphorylation. In addition, ATP-induced Akt phosphorylation was blocked almost completely by pre-treatment of macrophages with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (Fig. 3, lane 4), implying that ATP-mediated ROS production results in PI3K activation and subsequently to Akt phosphorylation/activation. ROS-dependent PI3K Activation Leads to ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—Recent studies have shown that ATP treatment of thymocytes and macrophages results in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which is downstream from PI3K activation (6Auger R. Motta I. Benihoud K. Ojcius D.M. Kanellopoulos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28142-28151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8da Cruz C.M. Ventura A.L. Schachter J.

To investigate whether ROS-dependent PI3K activation can in turn lead to ERK1/2 activation, we stimulated alveolar macrophages with ATP in the presence of antioxidants or PI3K inhibitors, and measured ERK1/2 phosphorylation by immunoblot, using Ab against phosphorylated residues of ERK1/2 (residues Thr202 and Tyr204) that lead to ERK1/2 activation (31Monteiro H.P. Rocha Oliveira C.J. Curcio M.F. Moraes M.S. Arai R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP stimulation of macrophages led to ERK1/2 phosphorylation within 1 min, consistent with the time course of ROS production after ATP treatment (Fig. 1C), which could be inhibited by NAC and the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98056 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the time course of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was also similar to Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), although Akt phosphorylation subsided after 10 min, as observed for ATP-induced ROS production (Fig. 1C). ERK1/2 phosphorylation was confirmed by measuring staining with Ab against phosphorylated ERK1/2 by FACS. Short ATP treatment led to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which could be inhibited partially by the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (Fig. 4, B and C) or LY294002 (Fig. 4C), or the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98056 (Fig. 4, B and C). Again, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited by co-treatment with NAC (not shown). Taken together, the results imply that ATP treatment leads to ROS production, which activates PI3K, and PI3K in turn activates Akt and ERK1/2. ATP-mediated Glutathionylation of PTEN Correlates with Activation of the PI3K Pathway—The phosphatase, PTEN, removes the 3′-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, thus inhibiting PI3K signaling. Previous studies have revealed that PTEN can be inhibited reversibly by H2O2 (32Leslie N.R. Bennett D. Lindsay Y.E. Stewart H. Gray A. Downes C.P.

Moreover, oxidized cysteines can then form a disulfide bond with glutathione (GSH), the main antioxidant present in the cell cytosol. A number of signaling proteins have recently been shown to undergo glutathionylation, including proteintyrosine phosphatases and transcription factors (34Kil I.S. Park J.W. J. Biol.

But as there are no known examples for activating kinases through glutathionylation, we reasoned that inactivation of PTEN through glutathionylation could result in de facto activation of the PI3K pathway. To test this hypothesis, macrophages were treated with ATP, lysed in a GSH-rich lysis buffer, and proteins were then immunoprecipitated with PTEN-conjugated beads and submitted to electrophoresis. Immunoblotting with an Ab against GSH revealed that a sizable fraction of PTEN exists in a monomeric form that can be recognized by the anti-GSH Ab even in untreated macrophages, with a smaller fraction of PTEN being found in a high molecular weight complex (Fig. 5A). But the amount of PTEN in both the monomeric glutathionylated form and in the high molecular weight complex increased significantly after a 3-min incubation with ATP (Fig. 5A). Treatment of the immunoprecipitate with the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, before electrophoresis resulted in disappearance of both the monomeric and multimeric PTEN (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that the Ab recognized only the glutathionylated form of PTEN. Reprobing the same membrane with an Ab against PTEN verified the presence of PTEN (60 kDa) in both the treated and untreated macrophages (Fig. 5B). The anti-PTEN Ab also confirmed the presence of PTEN in the high molecular weight complex, whose levels increased after the 3-min incubation with ATP (Fig. 5B). As expected, dithiothreitol dissociated PTEN from the multimeric complex, without affecting the presence of the monomeric PTEN (Fig. 5B). Thus, ATP-dependent glutathionylation of PTEN correlates with ATP-dependent activation of PI3K and is likely to contribute to activation of the PI3K pathway.

While the activity of E2F1–3 is tightly controlled by the retinoblastoma family of proteins, the expression of these factors is also regulated at the level of transcription, post-translational modifications and protein stability. Recently, a new level of regulation of E2Fs has been identified, where micro-RNAs (miRNAs) from the mir-17–92 cluster influence the translation of the E2F1 mRNA. We now report that miR-20a, a member of the mir-17–92 cluster, modulates the translation of the E2F2 and E2F3 mRNAs via binding sites in their 3′-untranslated region. We also found that the endogenous E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 directly bind the promoter of the mir-17–92 cluster activating its transcription, suggesting an autoregulatory feedback loop between E2F factors and miRNAs from the mir-17–92 cluster. Our data also point toward an anti-apoptotic role for miR-20a, since overexpression of this miRNA decreased apoptosis in a prostate cancer cell line, while inhibition of miR-20a by an antisense oligonucleotide resulted in increased cell death after doxorubicin treatment. This anti-apoptotic role of miR-20a may explain some of the oncogenic capacities of the mir-17–92 cluster. Altogether, these results suggest that the autoregulation between E2F1–3 and miR-20a is important for preventing an abnormal accumulation of E2F1–3 and may play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis.

The proper regulation of cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression is critical for the normal development of organisms and the prevention of cancer. Among the numerous factors involved in these processes, the E2F transcription factors play an essential role (1DeGregori J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 131-150PubMed Google Scholar, 2Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). E2F1, along with E2F2 and E2F3, are activators of cell cycle progression and promote the entry of quiescent cells into S phase (4DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

During G1, E2F1–3 are inhibited by their association with members of the retinoblastoma protein family (pRb, 5The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma; miRNA, micro-RNA; UTR, untranslated region; ASO, antisense oligoribonucleotides; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, estrogen receptor. p107, and p130) (3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). In mid to late G1, hyperphosphorylation of pRb by the cyclinD/cdk4-cdk6 complexes leads to the release of E2F1–3, which bind to specific E2F-responsive promoters, stimulating the transcription of genes involved in G1/S progression (6Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 7Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Most cancer cells contain mutations that deregulate the pRb/E2F pathway, which highlights its importance in the control of cellular proliferation. Deregulation of Rb/E2F control can also result in the activation of E2F1-induced apoptosis. Indeed, inactivation of pRb or overexpression of E2F1 promote apoptosis in several cell lines. E2F3 has also been shown to stimulate apoptosis but in a E2F1-dependent pathway (8Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). E2F1-responsive sites have been found in the promoters of several caspases as well as in other pro-apoptotic targets of p53 (9Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M.

E2F1 is also activated by the DNA damage signaling pathway (ATM/ATR) leading to the activation of both p53-dependent and independent, pro-apoptotic pathways (11Urist M. Tanaka T. Poyurovsky M.V. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Lin W.-C. Lin F.-T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, E2F1 provides direct coupling of the cell cycle and apoptotic machinery, and it has been suggested that cycling cells are primed for apoptosis by E2F1 should proliferation be perceived as aberrant (9Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M. Zhang M.Q. Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Besides the control of their activity by association with pRb, E2F1–3 are also regulated by phosphorylation (13Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin J.W.G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), acetylation (14Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.-M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T.

A. 1997; 94: 2221-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). E2F1–3 also regulate their own transcription through E2F-binding sites within their promoters (17Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 18Hsiao K.M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel mechanism of regulation of E2F1 activity has been identified: micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be important modulators of E2F1 mRNA translation (19O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). miRNAs are small 21–23 nucleotides non-coding RNAs that control the stability and/or translation of specific transcripts through the recruitment of the RNA-inducing silencing complex (reviewed in Ref. 20Zamore P.D. Haley B. Science. 2005; 309: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that miRNAs can regulate the expression of numerous genes (21Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9882) Google Scholar) and several studies point to the role of some miRNAs in the development of cancer (reviewed in Ref. 22Esquela-Kerscher A. Slack F.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (6202) Google Scholar). Among them, miRNAs from the mir-17–92 cluster have been shown to have an oncogenic activity when overexpressed with c-myc in a mouse model of human B-cell lymphoma (23He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. Nature. 2005; 435: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cluster is amplified in large-B cell lymphoma and in other malignant lymphomas (24Ota A. Tagawa H. Karnan S. Tsuzuki S. Karpas A. Kira S. Yoshida Y. Seto M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Moreover, miRNAs from this cluster are overexpressed in lung cancer cells and in colon, pancreas, and prostate tumors (25Hayashita Y. Osada H. Tatematsu Y. Yamada H. Yanagisawa K. Tomida S. Yatabe Y. Kawahara K. Sekido Y. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9628-9632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 26Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.-G. Ambs S. Cimmino A. Petrocca F. Visone R. Iorio M.

A. 2006; 103: 2257-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). Another group has also shown that the mir-17–92 cluster is directly regulated by MYC, and two miRNAs from this cluster, miR-17a and miR-20a, inhibited the translation of the E2F1 mRNA (19O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that miRNAs from the mir-17–92 cluster can act as oncogenic miRNAs or “oncomirs” when overexpressed, possibly by acting on key regulators of the cell cycle and apoptosis, like E2F1. Here, we show that miR-20a, a member of the mir-17–92 cluster, regulates not only E2F1 but also E2F2 and E2F3 via binding sites in the 3′-UTR of their respective mRNAs. We also report that E2F1–3 directly bind the promoter of the mir-17–92 cluster regulating its transcription. While overexpression of miR-20a decreased apoptosis in a prostate cancer cell line, inhibition of miR-20a by an antisense oligonucleotide resulted in increased cell death after doxorubicin treatment, pointing to a potential anti-apoptotic role for miR-20a. Altogether, these results suggest that the autoregulation between E2F1–3 and miR-20a is important for maintaining a balance between E2F activities in cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Plasmids Constructions—The E2Fs 3′-UTRs were amplified from the genomic DNA of HeLa cells using the following primers: E2F1, 5′-TGCTAGTCTAGAGGATTTCTGACAGGGCTTGGAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTACTAGCTAGCAGAAGGGAAGTGGAGAATGGGCAT-3′ (antisense); E2F2, 5′-TGCTAGTCTAGAGGTTCTAGTAAACGGCAGCTGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTACTAGCTACGGGACTTTAAGACGGGCGTCTGATA-3 (antisense); E2F3, 5′-CTACTATCTAGAGATCTAAGGTTTATCAGCCTCTGCA-3′ (sense); 5′-CTACTAGCTAGCTGTACCAAGTCCAGTGTGTGTGAG-3′ (antisense). The wild type and mutated 3′-UTRs of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 were cloned into the XbaI site of the pGL3-control vector (Promega). For the mutagenesis, the sequences complementary to the seed of the miR-20a miRNA in each 3′-UTR (GCACTTT) were replaced by the sequence (CGTGAAA). For the promoter analysis, a fragment of 1 kb from the miR-17–92 cluster promoter containing four E2F-binding sites was amplified from genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-CGGCTAGCAGGCTCAGGTACTGCAGCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCTCGAGGCACACAGGTTTCCCTC-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was cloned between the NheI and XhoI sites of the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega). To overexpress miR-20a, we cloned the miRNA precursor after PCR amplification from human DNA with the following primers: 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTCTATCTGATGTGACAGCTTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGAATTCAGCTGGAGTTCTACAGCTAGCAG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was subcloned into the retroviral vectors MLP and TMP (S. Lowe, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Luciferase Assays—Twenty-four hours before transfection, HeLa cells were plated at 300,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate. The pGL3-control plasmids containing the wild type or mutated 3′-UTRs were transfected (1.0 μg) with pRL-globin (0.1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For the analysis of the miR-17–92 cluster promoter, the pGL3-promoter plasmid containing a fragment of the promoter was transfected (3.0 μg) into HeLa cells (plated at 350,000 cells in 60 × 15-mm plates 24 h before transfection) in combination with different concentrations (0.1 μg, 0.5 μg, 1.0 μg, or with 1.0 μg of empty vector) of a pBABE plasmid expressing E2F-ER protein fusion and pRL-globin (0.1 μg) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The total quantity of pBABE plasmid was maintained at 1.0 μg by adding the empty vector to the various concentrations of pBABE-E2F-ER used. The media was changed 6 h after transfection for fresh medium containing 4-hydroxytamoxifen (500 nm). Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. For the analysis of E2Fs activity, 500 nm of 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide were transfected into HeLa cells (plated 300,000 cells per well 24 h before transfection) in combination with either the pGVB2 plasmid containing the p73 promoter (2.0 μg), the pGL2 Basic plasmid containing the HsORC-1 promoter (2.0 μg) or the pGL3-control plasmid containing the 3′-UTR of E2F1 (1.0 μg), with the pRL-globin plasmid (0.1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 2′-O-Methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides (ASO) used in this study were: miR-17-5p antisense, 5′-ACUACCUGCACUGUAAGCACUUUG-3′; miR-20a antisense, 5′-CUACCUGCACUAUAAGCACUUUA-3′; let-7 antisense, 5′-CUCUGAACUAUACAACCUACUACCUCAAUUUG-3′; and scramble, 5′-AAAACCUUUUGACCGAGCGUGUU-3′. The 2′-O-Me ASO were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. All the luciferase assays were conducted at least three times in triplicate. For each experiment, luciferase assays were performed 24 h after transfection using dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for each transfected well. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the miRVana kit total RNA extraction protocol (Ambion). 20 μgof total RNA were separated on 15% denaturating polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad), and hybridized using the Ambion protocol provided in the miRvana kit. The probe, complementary to miR-20 was labeled using T4 PNK (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridization was performed overnight at room temperature and the film was exposed for 5 days. Cell Viability Assay—Twenty-four hours before transfection, PC3 cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate. The 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides (200 pmol) were transfected using Oligofectamine. 6 h after transfection, the medium was changed and fresh medium containing 1.5 μg/ml doxorubicin was added. Cells were harvest 72 h after transfection and treated with trypan blue (Cambrex) to evaluate the cell death ratio. The experiment was conducted three times in triplicate. For miR-20a overexpression, either plasmid MLP-miR-20a or empty MLP plasmid were transfected in PC3 cells and selected with puromycin. About 105 cells per well in a 12-well plate from each of the selected populations were plated in medium with or without doxorubicin (100 ng/ml). After 3 days, all cells (even floating ones) were harvested and stained with 0.4% trypan blue. Percentage of dead cells (blue+) were counted under microscope. Data represent the average of three experiments. Cell Growth Assay—Either empty MLP vector or MLP-miR-20a vector were transiently transfected into PC3 cells. 24–36 h post-transfection, GFP+ cells were FACS-sorted (FACS Vantage SE, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). 5000 GFP+ cells per well were directly sorted into 24-well plate containing media with or without doxorubicin (125 ng/ml). 72 h post-transfection, media was changed and surviving cells were allowed to grow further for another 3 days. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS. Cells were then stained with 0.5% crystal violet, rinsed several times with large amount of cold water, and dried. Retained dye, which is proportional to cell mass/number, was extracted with suitable volumes of 10% acetic acid and 100 μl of extracted dye was used for absorbance measurements at A595 in 96-wells plate with a microplate reader. Data represent the average of three experiments. Clonogenic Survival Assay—After transient transfection and FACS sorting (as in the cell growth assay), 500 PC3 GFP+ cells per well were directly sorted into 6-well plate containing media with or without doxorubicin (12.5 ng/ml). 72 h post-transfection, medium was changed, and surviving cells were allowed to form colonies for another 8–10 days. Colonies were fixed with glutaraldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted manually. Data represent the average of three experiments. Western Blot—HeLa cells were trypsinized and washed one time with PBS, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 5 min, and the lysates were sonicated 4× for 5 s. The pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer, one time with PBS, two times with water, and resuspended in 25 μlof4× Laemli buffer and heated 5 min at 95 °C. The proteins were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The following antibodies were used for Western blot: anti-E2F1 KH-20 mouse (1 μg/ml), anti-E2F2 CC11 mouse (1 μg/ml), anti-α-tubulin (B-5-1-2 1:5000 mouse) (Sigma). Signals were revealed after incubation with anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1500) coupled to peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) by using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Regulation of E2F1–3 Expression by miR17/miR20 miRNAs—To investigate whether E2F1 expression was regulated by factors binding to its 3′-UTR, we fused the intact 3′-UTR of E2F1 to a luciferase reporter. We observed a 10-fold reduction in luciferase activity from transfected HeLa cells when compared with a luciferase reporter fused to the 3′-UTR of SV40 (Fig. 1A). Since O'Donnell et al. (19O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar) reported that the E2F1 mRNA contained binding sites for miR-17/miR-20 miRNAs that regulated its expression, we mutated the two miR-17-5p/miR-20a-binding sites in the E2F1 mRNA 3′-UTR. When both sites were mutated, we observed an increase in luciferase activity near to the control level (Fig. 1A). Moreover, co-transfection of the luciferase-E2F1 3′-UTR reporter with 2′-O-methyl ASO against miR-20a resulted in a 50% increase in luciferase activity compared with a let-7 2′-O-methyl ASO control (Fig. 1B). Together, these data support the previous observation that the translation of the E2F1 mRNA is regulated by miRNAs from the mir-17–92 cluster, including miR-20a, through miRNA-binding sites in the E2F1 mRNA 3′-UTR (19O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). Since it is known that other members of the E2F family, especially E2F2 and E2F3, share similar mechanisms of regulation, like Rb binding, acetylation, and co-transcriptional activation (3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 15Marzio G. Wagener C. Gutierrez M.I. Cartwright P. Helin K. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10887-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that miR-20a might also regulate the translation of the E2F2 and E2F3 mRNAs via binding sites in their 3′-UTR. Indeed, bioinformatics analyses predicted the presence of three miR-20a-binding sites in the 3′-UTR of the E2F2 mRNA and one site in the 3′-UTR of the E2F3 mRNA (27John B. Enright A.J. Aravin A. Tuschl T. Sander C. Marks D.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2956) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Both 3′-UTRs were cloned at the 3′ end of the luciferase gene in the pGL3 control plasmid and transfected in HeLa cells (due to its large size, the E2F2 3′-UTR that was cloned contained only the first two miR-20a-binding sites). Compared with the control luciferase reporter, near 2-fold decrease in luciferase activity was observed from the luciferase-E2F2 3′-UTR and the luciferase-E2F3 3′-UTR reporters (Fig. 1A). As we have done for the E2F1 3′-UTR, we mutated the binding sites of miR-20a in the luciferase-E2F2 3′-UTR and E2F3 3′-UTR reporters. As shown in Fig. 1A, mutagenesis of the miR-20a target sites increased luciferase activity in both reporter mRNAs near the level of the control, suggesting that binding of miR-20a in these 3′-UTR inhibits luciferase expression. We also determined the consequence of inhibiting miR-20a on the expression levels of endogenous E2Fs. As shown in Fig. 2, transfection of HeLa cells with the 2′-O-Me ASO against miR-20a resulted in an increased level of E2F1 and E2F2, as assessed by Western blot. Unfortunately, even with different antibodies, we have not been able to obtain clean E2F3 Western blots (data not shown). A 2′-O-Me ASO against miR-17, another member of the miR-20a family, also increased both E2F1 and E2F2 levels compared with the control ASO. Altogether, these results suggest that like E2F1, the E2F2 and E2F3 mRNAs are also targets of miR-20a.FIGURE 2Western blot analysis of endogenous levels of E2F1 and E2F2 in HeLa cells transfected with 2′-O-Me ASO against miR-20a, miR-17, scramble, or without ASO (Control). Numbers correspond to fold increase compared with control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of mir17/miR-20 Gene Expression by E2F1–3— Since E2F1–3 are transcription factors, we explored the possibility that they may regulate the expression of the miR-20a miRNA. We generated stably transfected HeLa cells expressing tamoxifen-inducible estrogen receptor (ER) ligand-binding domain fusion proteins of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 (28Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). After 6 h of tamoxifen induction, total RNA was extracted from these cells and the level of miR-20a was measured by Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of E2F1–3 lead to an increased level of miR-20a compared with the control HeLa cells, suggesting that the E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 transcription factors can induce the expression of miR-20a. We also transfected HeLa cells with a deletion mutant of a E2F-ER fusion (dmE2F), which lack the transactivation domain but retain the DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, induction of this deletion mutant E2F also led to increased miR-20a levels. Other studies have reported such effect of the dmE2F in various cellular systems (2Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), which suggests that the displacement of a repressive pRb-E2F complex from a promoter by the dmE2F may be sufficient to induce transcription. The miR-20a miRNA is part of a cluster of seven miRNAs, the mir-17–92 cluster, which is present on the chromosome 13 (24Ota A. Tagawa H. Karnan S. Tsuzuki S. Karpas A. Kira S. Yoshida Y. Seto M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). This cluster has been shown to be induced by the c-Myc proto-oncogene (19O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar) and amplified in B-cells lymphomas (23He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. Nature. 2005; 435: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased expression of miR-20a occurs at the level of the mir-17–92 cluster precursor, we took advantage of a HeLa cell line stably expressing E2F2-ER. We used real-time PCR to measure the level of pre-miRNA precursor following induction of E2F2. As shown in Fig. 3C, induction of the E2F2-ER fusion resulted in an increased precursor levels, suggesting that the miR-17–92 cluster is up-regulated by E2Fs. To determine whether this cluster may be directly regulated by the E2F1–3 transcription factors, we looked for putative E2F-binding sites within the first 5kb of the promoter of the mir-17–92 cluster using SiteScan. E2Fs are known to bind to a canonical TTTSSCGC sequence (where S = CorG) in the promoters of their target genes (29Tao Y. Kassatly R.F. Cress W.D. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6994-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We identified four putative E2F-binding sites in the mir-17–92 promoter matching to this sequence (Fig. 4, A and B). To confirm the binding of these E2Fs to the promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to detect the association of the endogenous E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 transcription factors with the mir-17–92 promoter in HeLa cells (Fig. 4C). In the mir-17–92 promoter, we generated amplicon A, which is close to two putative E2F-binding sites (sites 3 and 4), amplicon B, which overlaps two other E2F-binding sites (sites 1 and 2), and amplicon D, which overlaps the c-Myc-binding sites identified previously (19O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). Amplicon E was used as a negative control, while amplicon E2F1 in the E2F1 promoter was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 4C, amplicons A and B were amplified after chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-E2F2 and E2F3 antibodies but not with an anti-GFP antibody. Only the amplicon A was amplified with the anti-E2F1 antibody. Amplicons C and D were negative. Interestingly, a stronger PCR amplification of the amplicon B was observed with E2F3 compared with E2F2 or E2F1. It may either mean that E2F3 binds more strongly to this region of the promoter or that the E2F3 antibody is more efficient for immunoprecipitation. To confirm that the mir-17–92 cluster is regulated by the E2Fs, we cloned a 1-kb fragment of this promoter, containing the four E2F-binding sites overlapping the amplicons A and B (sites 1–4), upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-Promoter plasmid. Co-transfection of this reporter luciferase plasmid with increasing amount of the E2F-ER plasmids resulted in an increased activation of the luciferase gene (Fig. 4D). E2F1 showed a stronger activation of this promoter (∼8-fold), followed by E2F3 (∼6-fold), whereas E2F2 activation was smaller (∼2-fold). While E2F2 was as efficient as E2F1 and E2F3 to increase miR-20a levels (see Fig. 3), it may bind to sites that are outside of the 1-kb fragment cloned in the plasmid reporter. Similar levels of induction were observed using an E2F inducible ORC-1 promoter-luciferase reporter (Fig. 1 in the supplemental data). These results indicated that this fragment of the mir-17–92 cluster promoter is responsive to the E2F1–3 transcription factors. Altogether, these data suggest a self-regulatory mechanism, where the translation of the E2F1–3 mRNAs is controlled by the miR-20a miRNA, which itself is regulated by the E2Fs at the transcriptional level. Functional Consequences of the Regulation of E2F1–3 by miR-17/miR-20—As an inhibitor of E2F1–3 expression, miR-20a should block E2F-dependent gene expression and may act as an anti-proliferative and/or as an anti-apoptotic agent. To explore these questions, we first measured the impact of inhibiting the function of miR-20a on the activity of endogenous E2F1–3. To do so, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids containing luciferase reporter genes under the control of the ORC-1 or p73 promoter, both being E2F-inducible promoters (30Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The same cells were co-transfected with a 2′-O-Me ASO inhibitor against the endogenous miR-20a miRNA. As shown in Fig. 5, inhibition of miR-20a resulted in a 50% increase in the activation of the ORC-1 promoter (Fig. 5A) and p73 promoter (Fig. 5B). A control 2′-O-Me ASO against the let-7 miRNA did not result in the induction of these promoters. Such induction correlates with the increas"

Here we show that autophagy could be induced in the mammalian cells by chemicals, such as A23187, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and brefeldin A, that cause endoplasmic reticulum stress. Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced autophagy is important for clearing polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and for reducing cellular vacuolization in HCT116 colon cancer cells and DU145 prostate cancer cells, thus mitigating endoplasmic reticulum stress and protecting against cell death. In contrast, autophagy induced by the same chemicals does not confer protection in a normal human colon cell line and in the non-transformed murine embryonic fibroblasts but rather contributes to cell death. Thus the impact of autophagy on cell survival during endoplasmic reticulum stress is likely contingent on the status of cells, which could be explored for tumor-specific therapy.

Normal ER function is required for the correct folding of many proteins and their post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. ER stress is induced by the disturbance of the environment in the ER lumen, such as the calcium homeostasis or the redox status, or by the disturbance of ER function, such as glycosylation and transportation to Golgi complex (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). The typical chemicals that induce ER stress include A23187 and thapsigargin, both of which disturb the calcium homeostasis; tunicamycin, which suppresses glycosylation; and brefeldin A, which inhibits transportation to the Golgi complex (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 2.Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Thus these chemicals cause protein folding dysfunction, and the accumulated misfolded/unfolded proteins induce ER stress. ER stress is frequently observed in pathological conditions where protein misfolding is caused by genetic mutations either in the molecule to be processed or in the machinery processing the folding (3.Perlmutter D.H. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Kopito R.R. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E207-E209Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The major protective and compensatory mechanism during ER stress is the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 5.Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), which leads to translational attenuation and selective up-regulation of a number of bZip transcription factors (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 5.Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). UPR serves multiple functions, including the assistance of protein folding via the up-regulated ER protein chaperones and the enhanced degradation of misfolded proteins via the up-regulation of molecules involved in the ER-associated degradation pathway (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 5.Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). However, if the stress is excessive, the compensatory mechanisms may not be able to fully sustain ER function, and ER decompensation could lead to cell death (2.Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 6.Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether there are other mechanisms that can regulate ER stress. Macroautophagy (referred as autophagy hereafter) is mainly responsible for the degradation of long-lived proteins and subcellular organelles (7.Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct.

In the current study, we found that autophagy could be activated by the classical ER stress inducers in mammalian cells. However, autophagy alleviates ER stress and reduces cell death in cancer cells but not in non-transformed cells. This unique feature may be explored for certain types of cancer therapy in which ER stress constitutes a major cause of cell death. Reagents−The following antibodies were used: anti-Atg6/Beclin 1 (BD Biosciences), anti-Atg8/LC3B (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar), anti-Atg5 (26.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Sigma), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon). All chemicals were from Sigma or Invitrogen. Plasmids, siRNA, and Transfection−One to two μg of GFP-LC3B (rat) (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar) was transfected into 2 × 105 cells using Effectene according to the supplier’s protocol (Qiagen). Alternatively, murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and CCD-18Co cells were infected with Ad-GFP-LC3B (human) for 24–48 h before being analyzed. siRNAs (0.24 μm) were transfected into 1 × 106 cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 48 h before analysis. siRNAs against the following human genes were used: Atg6/Beclin 1 (5′-GGUCUAAGACGUCCAACAA-3′) and Atg8/LC3B (5′-GAAGGCGCUUACAGCUCAA-3′). Cell Culture and Microscopy−HCT116 Bax-positive and Bax-negative cell lines (27.Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) were maintained in McCoy’s 5A with the routine supplements. DU145 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with routine supplements. Wild type and Atg5-deficient MEFs were immortalized through SV40 large T overexpression and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with standard supplements (11.Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). The non-immortalized human colon cell line CCD-18Co was purchased from ATCC (CRL-1459™) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with standard supplements. All cell lines were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Cells (2 × 105/well) were seeded into 12-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends. For electron microscopy, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) followed by 1% OsO4. After dehydration, thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for observation under a JEM 1016CX electron microscope. To examine distribution of GFP-LC3B, cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope and digital images were acquired for analysis (SPOT, Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). To examine and quantify cellular vacuolization, digital phase-contrast images were recorded. Analysis of Cell Death−Cell death was determined using propidium iodide staining (1 μg/ml) and quantified by digital microscopy. Apoptotic cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei were quantified after Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) staining. Caspase activities were measured using 30 μg of proteins and 20 μm fluorescent substrates (Ac-DEVD-AFC, and Ac-LEVD-AFC for caspase-3 and -4, respectively). The fluorescence signals were detected by a fluorometer (Tecan GENios) at 400/510 nm (excitation/emission), as described previously (28.Ding W.X. Ni H.M. DiFrancesca D. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Assay−This is essentially performed as described previously (28.Ding W.X. Ni H.M. DiFrancesca D. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Forty micrograms of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were stained with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies and developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Induction of Macroautophagy by ER Stress Inducers in Mammalian Cells−A characteristic feature of autophagy activation is the conversion of the Atg8/LC3B from the unconjugated form (LC3B-I) to the phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (LC3B-II) (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar, 29.Ohsumi Y. Mizushima N. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The mammalian Atg8/LC3B is first cleaved by Atg4 to expose the conserved Gly120 and then conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine via a ubiquitination-like reaction mediated by Atg7, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)-like protein, and Atg3, a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2)-like protein. This process is also affected by another conjugation system, Atg5-Atg12-Atg16, and Atg6/Beclin 1 (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar, 29.Ohsumi Y. Mizushima N. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The non-cleaved unconjugated form of Atg8/LC3B (LC3B-I) is in the cytosol, whereas the cleaved, conjugated form (LC3B-II) targets to the autophagosomal membrane (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). The ER stress inducer A23187 could elicit a strong formation of the lipidated LC3B-II in a dose-dependent manner in a colon cancer cell line, HCT116 (Fig. 1A), independent of the presence of the pro-apoptotic molecule, Bax, which is critical to apoptosis induction in this cell line (see below). Other ER stress inducers, including tunicamycin (TM), thapsigargin (TG), and brefeldin A (BA), could also induce such an accumulation (Fig. 1B and data not shown). This conversion could be suppressed by the autophagy-inhibiting agent, 3-methyadenine (3-MA) (12.Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B.

Consistently, cells expressing GFP-LC3B showed a transition of the GFP-LC3B signals from the diffusive cytoplasm pattern to the punctated membrane pattern following the application of the ER stress inducers (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting the formation of autophagic vacuoles. Similarly, GFP-LC3B puncta could be suppressed by 3-MA or a specific siRNA against Atg6/Beclin 1 (Fig. 1, D and E). Electron microscopic study indicated that a significant amount of autophagic vacuoles was present in HCT116 as well as in DU145, a prostate cancer cell line, following the treatment of A23187, TM, TG, or BA (Fig. 2). Both double-membrane and multimembrane structures with different intracellular contents could be observed.FIGURE 2Electron microscopic detection of autophagy vacuoles. A, Bax-deficient HCT116 (panels a–d) or DU145 (panels e–h) cells were treated with A23187 (2.5 μm, panel a and e), TG (0.5 μm, panel b and f), TM (5 μg/ml, panel c and g), or BA (2.5 μm, panel d and h) for 16 h. Cells were then fixed and subjected to electron microscopy. The representative morphology of autophagic vacuoles is shown. Both double-membrane and multimembrane vacuoles are observed. Scale bar, 0.5 μm. B, the number of autophagic vacuoles was quantified in Bax-deficient HCT 116 and DU145 cells.

Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Limiting the protein influx into the ER network could reduce the stress level and thus autophagy induction. Indeed, treatment of cells with the general transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, or the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide, suppressed the formation of LC3-II (Fig. 3A) and the translocation of GFP-LC3B to autophagic vacuoles (Fig. 3B). Together, these data strongly indicate that a diverse array of chemicals could activate macroautophagy via the induction of ER stress. Autophagy Protects Cancer Cells from ER Stress and Cell Death−We then examined the significance of autophagy in the regulation of ER stress. In HCT116 and DU145 cells, ER stress inducers could cause cellular vacuolization to different degrees (Fig. 4, A–C). These vacuoles represented dilated ER lumens under stress based on electron microscopic examination (data not shown). Notably, suppression of autophagy with either 3-MA or a specific siRNA against Atg6/Beclin 1 (Fig. 4, B and C) or Atg8/LC3B (data not shown) increased the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic vacuolization, suggesting an enhanced level of ER stress. The accumulated misfolded proteins in the ER lumen are normally degraded through ER-associated degradation pathway via the proteasomes following ubiquitination (31.Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Thus an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins could indicate the level of misfolded proteins and therefore the level of ER stress. Indeed, both A23187 and TM could elevate the level of polyubiquitinated proteins in HCT116 cells and DU145 cells (Fig. 4, D and E). Ubiquitinated protein aggregates could be also readily detected in treated cells (Fig. 4, F and G), which suggested that the accumulation of these proteins exceeded the capacity of proteasomes for degradation (32.Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Importantly, suppressing autophagy by 3-MA or a specific siRNA against Atg6/Beclin 1 (Fig. 4, D, F, and G) led to further increases in polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. Taken together, it seems that autophagy can function to reduce ER stress based on its effects on cellular vacuolization and polyubiquitinated protein accumulation. As the level of ER stress could correlate with the extent of cell death, we examined whether autophagy induced in these cancer cells could have any effects on ER stress-induced cell death. Apoptosis in HCT116 cells is heavily dependent on the presence of Bax (27.Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The syngeneic Bax-deficient cells derived from the parental Bax-positive cells require more potent stimuli to go into apoptosis through the alternate Bak-mediated mechanism (33.Chandra D. Choy G. Daniel P.T. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19051-19061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the regular dose ranges where ER stress and autophagy could be activated, Bax-positive HCT116 cells were much more sensitive to A23187-, TG-, TM-, or BA-induced apoptosis than the Bax-deficient HCT116 cells (Fig. 5A). Suppression of autophagy with either 3-MA (data not shown) or a specific siRNA against Atg6/Beclin 1 or Atg8/LC3B (Fig. 5, B and C) led to increased apoptosis in the Bax-positive HCT116 cells. The activities of both effector caspases and the ER stress-specific caspase-4 were enhanced (Fig. 5, D and E). Interestingly, under this condition, a significant amount of Bax-deficient HCT116 cells also became apoptotic with enhanced caspase activation (Fig. 5), perhaps reflecting an elevated level of death stimulation when autophagy was suppressed. Similar enhancement in cell death could be also observed in the Bax-deficient DU145 cells (data not shown). These observations suggest that autophagy can protect against cell death in cancer cells, likely by curtailing the level of ER stress and therefore the potency of death stimulation. Autophagy Promotes Cell Death in Non-transformed Cells Treated with ER Stress Inducers−To determine the significance of autophagy in ER stress-induced cell death in different types of cells, we took the advantage of the availability of immortalized MEFs that are Atg5-deficient (11.Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). All four ER stress inducers could induce GFP-LC3B punctation and the lipidated LC3B-II formation in the MEFs in an Atg5-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). Electron microscopic examination of these cells indicated that there was an Atg5-dependent accumulation of intracellular autophagic vacuoles (Fig. 6C). However, treatment of ER stress inducers did not induce cellular vacuolization in the MEFs (Fig. 7A), no matter whether Atg5 is expressed or not. Furthermore, in contrast to what was observed in HCT116 and DU145 cells, deficiency of autophagy in MEFs led to reduced apoptosis. Thus Atg5-deficient MEFs were much less susceptible to apoptosis and caspase activation induced by A23187, TG, TM, or BA than the wild type MEFs (Fig. 7, B–D). Consistently, reintroduction of Atg5 into the Atg5-deficient MEFs restored their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of ER stress (Fig. 7E).FIGURE 7Suppression of ER stress-induced autophagy reduces cell death in MEFs. A, wild type (panels a–d) and atg5-deficient (panels e–h) MEFs were treated for 24 h with A23187 (2.5 μm, panels a and e), TM (5 μg/ml, panels b and f), TG (0.5 μm, panels c and g), and BA (2.5 μm, panels d and h) for 24 h. The morphology of cells was examined by phase microscopy. Note the lack of cellular vacuolization in treated cells and the reduced cell death in atg5-deficient cells. B and C, the percentages of propidium iodide-positive cells (B) and apoptotic cells (C) were then determined by propidium iodide or Hoechst 33342 staining, respectively. Ctrl, control. D, caspase-3 activities were measured using Ac-DEVD-AFC as the substrate. E, atg5-deficient MEFs were transfected with murine Atg5 or the vector control for 24 h and then treated with A23187 or TG for another 24 h before being analyzed for apoptosis as described above. The inset shows an immunoblot assay on Atg5 and β-actin expression in these cells. Atg5 was detected as the complex with Atg12. All values were shown as mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To support the hypothesis that this pro-death character of autophagy may be related to the non-cancerous status of the MEFs, we examined a non-immortalized normal human colon cell line (CCD-18Co), which would be more comparable with HCT116 colon cancer cells. Treatment of this cell line with A23187 or TM induced autophagy that could be suppressed by 3-MA (Fig. 8A). However, 3-MA co-treatment did not lead to increased cell death but rather resulted in reduced cell death (Fig. 8, B–D), consistent with the observations in MEFs. Interestingly, these treatments did not induce noticeable cellular vacuolization in this cell line either. Taken together, these observations in the non-transformed cells are in stark contrast to those in HCT116 and DU145 cells, suggesting that the role of ER stress-induced autophagy in cell survival is contingent on the status of the cells and can be different in cancer cells and in non-transformed cells under a given set of stimuli. Induction of Macroautophagy by ER Stress−As the major organelle processing post-translational modifications and supporting correct protein folding, ER also possesses the mechanisms to retro-transport proteins that fail to be modified and/or folded properly (31.Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). These proteins are then ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. This ER-associated degradation pathway is important for maintaining ER homeostasis. The accumulation of the unfolded/misfolded proteins, such as that due to the use of A23817, TM, TG, or BA, can lead to ER stress. The UPR is a classical mechanism that cells mount to relieve ER stress, which aims to reduce overall cellular protein synthesis, assists protein folding, and promotes ER-associated degradation (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 5.Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Here we show that autophagy is activated in response to ER stress in the mammalian cells and could be another mechanism regulating ER stress and the outcome. Notably, ER stress could also induce autophagy in the yeast (34.Yorimitsu T. Nair U. Yang Z. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30299-30304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), indicating that this response is evolutionarily conserved. How ER stress leads to the activation of autophagy is not quite understood. Transcriptional up-regulation of certain Atg genes, such as Atg12 (24.Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Tanida I. Ueno T. Isoai A. Kumagai H. Ogawa S. Kaufman R.J. Kominami E. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. June 23, 2006; DOI 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401984PubMed Google Scholar) and Atg8/LC3B (data not shown), have been observed and could be important. Although the majority of cellular protein synthesis is shut down during ER stress, a selected group of proteins, such as the bZIP transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, are activated down-stream of eIF2α kinase, which is an important component of the UPR (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 5.Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). These transcription factors could be involved in the autophagy activation. Indeed, eIF2α has been found to be important for autophagy induced by the pathogenic polyglutamine repeats (24.Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Tanida I. Ueno T. Isoai A. Kumagai H. Ogawa S. Kaufman R.J. Kominami E. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. June 23, 2006; DOI 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401984PubMed Google Scholar), viral infection, and starvation (35.Talloczy Z. Jiang W. Virgin H.W.t. Leib D.A. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Eskelinen E.L. Levine B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Other UPR response pathways, such as those mediated by Ire1 and ATF6, could also be involved. Although other activation mechanisms may also be required for a full activation of autophagy, our data strongly indicate that signals from ER stress are critical for the triggering of autophagy, which would require further characterization in the future. The Significance of Autophagy in ER Stress and ER Stress-induced Cell Death−In the cancer cells, autophagy helps to alleviate ER stress, and subsequently, the cell death. How autophagy mitigates ER stress is not completely clear at this moment. Our observations indicate that autophagy is important for the clearance of ubiquitinated unfolded/misfolded proteins and therefore reduces ER stress induced by these molecules. This notion is also supported by the finding made in mice with conditional deletion of Atg5 or Atg7 in the central nervous system, which leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the neurons (22.Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N.

Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been found that misfolded proteins, such as the mutant α1-antitrypsin Z protein and the pathogenic polyglutamine repeats, could all induce autophagy in addition to ER stress, independent of their cellular locations (24.Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Tanida I. Ueno T. Isoai A. Kumagai H. Ogawa S. Kaufman R.J. Kominami E. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. June 23, 2006; DOI 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401984PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Teckman J.H.

Although promotion of autophagy enhances the clearance of the mutant molecules and reduces the toxicity, inhibition of autophagy results in the opposite (21.Kamimoto T. Shoji S. Hidvegi T.

Thus autophagy can be protective against ER stress in a number of circumstances including cancer cells. Paradoxically, although disturbing ER homeostasis and/or functions by the chemicals could also elicit autophagy in the primary colon cells, suppression of autophagy does not enhance cell death but instead reduces cell death. In addition, suppression of autophagy induced by the same chemicals in the immortalized but non-transformed MEFs by deletion of Atg5 also reduces cell death. These data suggest that autophagy can contribute to ER stress-induced cell death in different scenarios, which may be dependent on cellular status under a given stimulation. However, the exact mechanisms affecting such a different outcome are yet to be determined. In the context of the current experiment, we speculate that the differential role of autophagy in cell survival in the cancer cells and non-transformed cells may be related to how well the ER stress is compensated. Both MEFs and CCD-18Co might be better compensated in response to the stimulation. One hint for this assumption is that treatment of ER stress inducers did not cause cellular vacuolization, and inhibiting autophagy did not seem to promote vacuolization in these cells (Figs. 7A and 8D). Although autophagy could still be involved in clearing misfolded proteins, its degradation capability might turn out to be “too extensive” for the better compensated cells, in which autophagy may lead to excessive consumption of bystander normal cellular constituents and therefore contribute negatively to cell survival. Future work will be directed to seek experimental evidence to test this hypothesis. However, our current work has indicated the importance of understanding the underlying mechanism and pointed out a potential benefit of such an understanding that the differential effect of autophagy in cancer cells and non-transformed cells may be explored for tumor-specific therapy.

S. aureus can invade various types of non-professional phagocytes to produce host cell death. We show here that shortly after invasion of HeLa cells S. aureus transit to autophagosomes was characterized by double membranes and co-localization with LC3. S. aureus were not able to replicate and produce cell death in autophagy-deficient atg5-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. S. aureus-containing autophagosomes do not acidify nor do they acquire lysosome-associated membrane protein-2, indicating that S. aureus inhibits autophagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes. Eventually, S. aureus escape from autophagosomes into the cytoplasm, which results in caspase-independent host cell death. S. aureus strains deficient for agr, a global regulator of S. aureus virulence, were not targeted by autophagy and did not produce host-cell death.

The results of this study suggest that rapid induction of autophagy is essential for S. aureus replication, escape into the cytoplasm, and host cell killing. Staphylococcus aureus is the major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and wound infections (1Emori T.G. Gaynes R.P. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 2Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4639) Google Scholar). An important feature of S. aureus is the ability to invade the vascular system from local infection sites (3Petti C.A. Fowler Jr., V.G. Cardiol. Clin. 2003; 21: 219-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such dissemination includes passing across cellular barriers like the endothelial barrier, which leads to bacteremia and sepsis. Recent studies revealed the consistent ability of S. aureus to infect various types of non-professional phagocytic host cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells (4Almeida R.A. Matthews K.R. Cifrian E. Guidry A.J. Oliver S.P. J. Dairy Sci. 1996; 79: 1021-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 5Ogawa S.K. Yurberg E.R. Hatcher V.B.

Microbiol. 2000; 27: 235-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adherence to and invasion of non-professional phagocytic cells by S. aureus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of invasive and metastatic infections i.e. during hematogenous dissemination (7Sinha B. Herrmann M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 266-277PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that some but not all S. aureus strains are able to induce host cell death after invasion, which correlates with the virulence of a particular S. aureus strain (8Krut O. Utermohlen O. Schlossherr X. Krönke M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2716-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to intracellular survival of S. aureus and death of host cells remained unclear. Although some investigators reported induction of caspase-dependent programmed cell death (apoptosis) involving tumor necrosis factor or CD95 signaling pathways, others observed necrosis of S. aureus-infected host cells induced byα-toxin (9Baran J. Weglarczyk K. Mysiak M. Guzik K. Ernst M. Flad H.D. Pryjma J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1287-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Essmann F. Bantel H. Totzke G. Engels I.H. Sinha B.

Microbiol. 2003; 5: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In many cases microorganisms internalized by host cells are efficiently eliminated by host defense mechanisms. The microbial phagosome matures by sequential transient fusion events with early and late endosomal compartments, which are controlled by Rab GTPases (12Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Grinstein S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 689-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, some pathogens like Mycobacteria tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and Brucella abortus have evolved species-specific mechanisms of subverting host vesicle trafficking to prevent fusion of the phagosome with the lysosomes. Other bacteria like Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, and Rickettsia spp. can escape from phagosomes into the cytoplasm, multiply, and even disseminate into neighboring cells by eliciting actin polymerization (13Meresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Moreno E. Desjardins M. Finlay B. Gorvel J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). S. aureus are able to escape the phagolysosomal pathway, which is prerequisite for intracellular bacterial survival and killing of the eukaryotic host cell (14Bayles K.W. Wesson C.A. Liou L.E. Fox L.K. Bohach G.A. Trumble W.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 336-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of an inefficient phagosomal degradation pathway, infected host cells are capable of combating intracellular pathogens by a process called autophagy, which involves bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components. Autophagy is a conserved membrane-traffic pathway in eukaryotic cells that sequesters cytoplasmic contents by double membranes and eventually delivers them to lysosomes. Autophagy is crucially involved in physiological processes such as cellular homeostasis, morphogenesis, cellular differentiation, tissue remodeling, and antigen presentation but also in response to various stress conditions such as nutrient or insulin limitation (15Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagy can be induced by pharmacological means such as rapamycin, an inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase Tor (target of rapamycin). On the other hand inhibition of the type III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by wortmannin or 3-methyladenine results in the reduction of autophagy (16Kirkegaard K. Taylor M.P. Jackson W.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, a series of factors conserved from yeast to man is involved in sequential steps of autophagy (17Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar). Some of the best-defined markers of autophagy are the Atg5 protein that is associated with the nascent isolation membrane and the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain (LC3 2The abbreviations used are: LC3, light chain; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CFU, colony-forming units; LAMP-2, lysosome-associated membrane protein-2; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts. /Atg8) (18Mizushima N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The presence of Atg5 and its proper conjugation with the ubiquitin-like molecule Atg12 are specifically required for the elongation of the autophagic isolation membrane. Disruption of the atg5 gene in mice resulted in the absence of autophagy leading to reduced amino acid concentrations in plasma and tissues, energy depletion, and death within 24 h postpartum (19Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2405) Google Scholar). LC3/Atg8, the only highly specific marker of the autophagosome, undergoes C-terminal proteolytic processing and conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine, upon which it translocates from the cytosol to the autophagosomal membrane (20Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated a role for autophagy in host cell defense against Streptococcus pyogenes. Once within the cytosol, autophagy targets this pathogen and effectively restricts its growth (21Nakagawa I. Amano A. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Yamaguchi H. Kamimoto T. Nara A. Funao J. Nakata M. Tsuda K. Hamada S. Yoshimori T. Science. 2004; 306: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Metabolically arrested L. monocytogenes are also trapped by autophagosomes and undergo lysosomal degradation (22Rich K.A. Burkett C. Webster P. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rickettsia spp. have been observed in double-membrane autophagosome-like structures, correlating with bacterial destruction and decreased replication (23Rikihisa Y. Anat.

In interferon-activated macrophages autophagy targets M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes to overcome the block in phagosomal maturation imposed by this pathogen (25Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S.

These studies suggest that autophagy targets bacteria in the cytosol and within vacuoles by yet unclear mechanisms. Notwithstanding, several Gram-negative pathogens including B. abortus, L. pneumophila, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Coxiella burnetii in fact benefit from the autophagic pathway. Once within an autophagosome, they modify this compartment to create an environment to survive and replicate (26Dorn B.R. Dunn Jr., W.A. Progulske-Fox A. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The role of autophagy for S. aureus survival and replication in host cells is yet to be resolved. Although the role of autophagy is mainly to support cell survival, excessive autophagy can be detrimental. The so-called “autophagic cell death” or “type 2 cell death” is characterized by the appearance of cytoplasmic vacuoles related to autophagosomes. This type of programmed cell death does not require caspase activation and, thus, differs from apoptosis. However, the signal cascades of both death pathways appear to be intertwined. For example, the major anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 physically interacts with the autophagy protein Beclin-1 (Atg6), inhibiting starvation-induced autophagy and cell death (27Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2956) Google Scholar). Moreover, pro-apoptotic stimuli can activate autophagic death in cells that are protected against apoptosis by either overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL), lack of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax-/- and Bak-/-), or inhibition of caspases by z-VAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor (28Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). S. aureus possess a vast array of specific virulence factors, like adhesins, toxins, and enzymes, whose expression is tightly regulated by a set of global virulence regulators. These systems when activated modulate the expression of many extracellular as well as cell wall-associated proteins. The most important and best-studied system is the accessory gene regulator (agr) system (29Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). This quorum-sensing regulated system is activated by an autoinducing cyclic peptide. When the bacterial cell density reaches a certain threshold, toxins, proteases, and other extracellular proteins are up-regulated, whereas the production of adhesins and other cell wall-associated proteins is diminished (30Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Although S. aureus-derived factors triggering cell death have not been identified so far, it has been recognized that one or more of them are under the control of the agr system. It has been reported that loss-of-function agr mutants invade mammary bovine epithelial cells with a higher internalization rate but fail to induce cell death (31Wesson C.A. Liou L.E. Todd K.M. Bohach G.A. Trumble W.R. Bayles K.W. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5238-5243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Haslinger-Loeffler et al. (32Haslinger-Loffler B. Kahl B.C. Grundmeier M. Strangfeld K. Wagner B. Fischer U. Cheung A.L. Peters G. Schulze-Osthoff K. Sinha B. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) also reported strongly impaired cell death in human umbilical vein endothelial cells infected with S. aureus agr mutants. In the present study we elucidate the role of autophagy for S. aureus during infection of non-professional phagocytes. We demonstrate that S. aureus diverts from the endosomal pathway to autophagosomes in an agr-dependent manner. S. aureus-induced autophagy is required for S. aureus replication, subsequent escape from autophagosomes into the cytoplasm, and S. aureus-induced host cell death. Antibodies—Anti-cytochrome c, anti-caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen), anti-human lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), anti-protein A (Sigma), anti human Beclin-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) were purchased from indicated companies. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—S. aureus strains MW2 (NRS123), USA300 (NRS384), NCTC8325 (NRS77), NRS151, the isogenic agr-deficient mutant of NCTC8325, and RN4220 (NRS144), partial agr-deficient mutant of NCTC 8325, were obtained from NARSA (The network on antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus, Herndon, VA). S. aureus strain ATCC29213 was obtained from the DMSZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany). For infection experiments S. aureus were grown on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. Colonies from agar plates were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth overnight at 37 °C, diluted with fresh broth, and cultured until mid-logarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.3). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Biochrom, Germany), and adjusted to a concentration of 109 CFU/ml. To generate GFP-expressing S. aureus, GFP was cloned under control of staphylococcal blaZ promoter in the shuttle vector pMK4 (33Sullivan M.A. Yasbin R.E. Young F.E. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A 150-bp segment containing the blaZ promoter was amplified from S. aureus DNA by PCR using primers 5′-GGAATTCAAAGCTTACTATGCTCATTATT-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCAAAATAAACCCTCCG-3′. The amplified DNA segment was gel-purified, digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction endonucleases, and cloned into pMK4 vector by standard techniques. The open reading frame of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was amplified from pEGFP-N1 (BD Clontech, San Jose, CA) with specific primers containing restriction sites for BamHI and PstI. Amplicon was ligated downstream from blaZ promoter using corresponding endonucleases. The resulting construct designated pS1-GFP was introduced into S. aureus by electroporation (34Lee J.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Cell Culture—The human epithelial cell line HeLa was obtained from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biochrom). If not indicated otherwise, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate (Biochrom) were added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All cultivation steps were performed at 37 °C in humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HeLa cells stably expressing the EGFP microtubule-associated protein LC3 fusion protein and the Δ20G120A mutant were generated using the ViraPower™ II Lentiviral Gateway® Expression System (Invitrogen). The EGFP tag was amplified by PCR using forward, 5′-CACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTAAAGCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′, primers and pEGFP-N1 as template. LC3 open reading frames were generated using forward, 5′-CACCAAGCTTATGCCGTCGGAGAAGACCTTCAAGCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTACACTGACAATTTCATCCCG-3′, primers. The mutant LC3 protein lacking 20 C-terminal amino acids and possessing a glycine to alanine substitution at position 120 (LC3Δ20G120A) was generated using the reverse primer 5′-TTAGGCGAACGTCTCCTGGGAGGCATAG-3′. The full-length LC3-cDNA clone (RZPD, German Resource Center for Genome Research, Berlin, Germany) served as template. Amplicons of EGFP and LC3 were digested with HindIII, ligated to create a fusion segment, and reamplified using the corresponding flanking primers. The resulting DNA segments coding for the EGFP-LC3 or EGFP-LC3Δ20G120A fusion proteins were cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO Vector (Invitrogen) and further processed to generate lentiviral particles according to manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells were infected with viral stock at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) 1 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Recombinants were selected by the addition of 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks, subcloned, and verified for proper expression of fusion proteins by fluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. To generate cells overexpressing XIAP proteins or Bcl-2 (HeLa-XIAP or HeLa-Bcl-2), XIAP-or Bcl-2-encoding cDNA were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using a first-strand cDNA derived from HeLa cells as the template and specific primers containing EcoRI and XhoI digestion sites. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI followed by ligation into pcDNA3 containing a N-terminal Myc tag (Invitrogen). HeLa cells were stably transfected with pcDNA or pcDNA-Myc-XIAP followed by selection in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in atg5 and the corresponding wild type cells were kindly provided by Dr. Noboru Mizushima (The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan) (19Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2405) Google Scholar). S. aureus Infection of Eukaryotic Host Cells—The in vitro infection was performed as previously described (8Krut O. Utermohlen O. Schlossherr X. Krönke M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2716-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At 18 h before infection 1 × 105 eukaryotic cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Cells were then washed with growth medium without antibiotics and kept for 1 h at 37 °C. A m.o.i. of 200 or 20 S. aureus were added per well. After 1 h of incubation, cells were detached from the culture plate and washed with growth medium. Extracellular bacteria were killed by adding 100 μg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma) and incubating cells for 15 min at 37 °C. To remove lysostaphin and dead bacteria, cells were washed with growth medium supplemented with antibiotics and reseeded in a new six-well plate. Viability was monitored by using trypan blue (Biochrom) exclusion (36Bonifacio J.S.E. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York2000: 1.1.1-1.1.10Google Scholar). CFU Determination—Infected host cells were washed with PBS to remove antibiotics and lysed in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Lysates were diluted with PBS and plated on Mueller-Hinton agar by using a spiral plater (EDDY-Jet; IUL Instruments, Koenigswinter, Germany). Colony counting and CFU determination were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Induction and Inhibition of Autophagy and Apoptosis—Autophagy was induced by treatment with rapamycin (Sigma) used in concentrations ranging from 20 to 80 μg/ml for 2 h. Alternatively, cells were incubated in starvation medium composed of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.035% NaHCO3 for 2 h at 37 °C. Autophagy was inhibited by addition of 50–200 nm wortmannin (Sigma) or 5 mm 3-methyladenine (Sigma) to cell culture medium before infection. For induction of apoptosis cells were exposed to UV light (20 mJ/cm2). Caspase activity was inhibited by a pretreatment of cells with 100 μm z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (Alexis, Gruenberg, Germany) for 30 min. Transient Transfection of HeLa Cells—Expression vector pRAB7-GFP (37Rzomp K.A. Scholtes L.D. Briggs B.J. Whittaker G.R. Scidmore M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5855-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips and infected with S. aureus at m.o.i. 20. At the indicated time points, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Before staining with antibodies, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Samples were incubated with the indicated specific antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 568-labeled secondary antibody. All antibodies were used in a 1:1000 dilution. Specimens were mounted on microscope slides in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen). For LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Invitrogen) staining, cells were incubated with 50 nm dye for 30 min under normal growth conditions, washed with PBS, and directly observed under the fluorescence microscope. Images were acquired with an inverted Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a F-View II Trigger camera and then analyzed by analySISD software (Soft Imaging Software, Muenster, Germany) or with a confocal microscope Leica TC SL and analyzed by Leica Confocal Software (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). For electron microscopy, infected cells were fixed overnight in fresh half-strength Karnovsky's fixation (4% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3), extensively buffer-rinsed, and osmicated for 1 h with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate. Samples were dehydrated by rinsing in graded ethanol series including an uranylic acetate en bloc staining step overnight in 70% ethanol. Before infiltration with Araldite Cy212 epoxy resin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), propylene oxide was used as intermedium. Tissue blocks were cured for 60 h at 60 °C. Thin (60 nm) cross-sections were taken on an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Reichert, Heidelberg, Germany). Thin sections were stained with 1% aqueous uranylic acetate for 20 min, and sections were counterstained with Reynold's lead citrate for 7 min (38Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17747) Google Scholar). Thin sections were mounted on 150 mesh Formvar-coated copper grids and examined with a Zeiss EM 902 electron microscope at 80 kV acceleration voltage (Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany) and analyzed by using analySIS software. Isolation of S. aureus-containing Phagosomes—Phagosome isolation was performed as previously described (39Luhrmann A. Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 2000; 22: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were infected as described above. After the indicated infection time, medium was removed and replaced with ice-cold PBS. Cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in homogenization buffer comprised of 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.2), and lysed in a Dura Grind stainless-steel homogenizer. The resulting cell homogenate was cleared by centrifugation, and organelles were fractionated in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. Phagosomes were recovered from the interface of 55 and 65% sucrose layers, separated through a 15% Ficoll cushion at 18,000 × g, and concentrated in a final centrifugation step at 18,000 × g. Quality of intact isolated phagosomes was controlled by electron microscopy. For immunoblotting, phagosomes were lysed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Extracted proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Preparation of Cytosolic Extracts and Immunoblotting—For isolation of cytosolic extracts, 107 cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,5 mm EGTA, 10 mm cytochalasin B, protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics), and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 20 min on ice for swelling. Cells were cracked by passing through a 27-gauge needle. Cell breakage was verified microscopically by trypan blue exclusion. Membranes were pelleted at 140,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were recovered (cytosolic extract). Equal volumes of the cytosolic extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran 0.2 mm; Schleicher and Schuell) via electroelution. Membranes were stained with the indicated antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugates of anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), used as secondary antibodies. Signals were detected by ECL reagent (GE Healthcare). Caspase-independent Killing of Host Cells by Intracellular S. aureus—Previous studies revealed that induction of host cell death by S. aureus requires bacterial invasion and expression of multiple gene products regulated by the global regulator agr (31Wesson C.A.

Immun. 1998; 66: 5994-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether S. aureus induces cell death by necrosis or apoptosis remained controversial. To disentangle the cellular mechanisms of S. aureus-induced cell death, we used HeLa cells in a system that recapitulates the S. aureus responsive phenotype previously reported for a variety of host cell types. As shown in Fig. 1A, S. aureus strains NCTC8325, ATCC29213, MW2, and USA300 efficiently killed HeLa cells with death rates of 65, 82, 95, and 98%, respectively. In contrast, the agr-deficient S. aureus strains NRS151 and RN4220 did not generate any significant cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. It is important to note that all S. aureus strains were taken up by HeLa cells with similar kinetics and in similar quantities (data not shown). To investigate the impact of apoptotic machinery in cytotoxicity induced during S. aureus infection, HeLa cells were lysed at distinct times after infection, and cellular lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for processing/activation of executioner caspase-3 and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. As shown in Fig. 1B, compared with UV irradiation used as positive control, cytotoxic S. aureus strains MW2 and ATCC29213 produced only weak processing of caspase-3 and diminished release of cytochrome c. Preincubation of HeLa cells with the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not prevent S. aureus-induced cell death (Fig. 1C), indicating that S. aureus-induced cell death is independent of the caspase activation cascade. Activity of z-VAD-fmk was controlled (data not shown). Similarly, overexpression of XIAP, an X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, did not prevent S. aureus-induced killing of HeLa cells (Fig. 1D). XIAP is known to negatively regulate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by directly binding and interfering with caspases-3, -7, and -9, confirming the idea that caspases do not play an essential role in S. aureus-induced cell death. In contrast, S. aureus-induced cell death was suppressed in Bcl-2 overexpressing HeLa cells. It is important to note that Bcl-2 is not only anti-apoptotic but also exerts anti-autophagic function through binding to Beclin-1/Atg6. This raised the question about the molecular mechanisms of caspase-independent S. aureus-indu"
https://openalex.org/W2005917601,"In humans both the levels and activity of the alpha-subunit of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-alpha) are regulated by its post-translation hydroxylation as catalyzed by iron- and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3 and factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH), respectively). One consequence of hypoxia is the accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (TCAIs). In vitro assays were used to assess non-2OG TCAIs as inhibitors of purified PHD2 and FIH. Under the assay conditions, no significant FIH inhibition was observed by the TCAIs or pyruvate, but fumarate, succinate, and isocitrate inhibited PHD2. Mass spectrometric analyses under nondenaturing conditions were used to investigate the binding of TCAIs to PHD2 and supported the solution studies. X-ray crystal structures of FIH in complex with Fe(II) and fumarate or succinate revealed similar binding modes for each in the 2OG co-substrate binding site. The in vitro results suggest that the cellular inhibition of PHD2, but probably not FIH, by fumarate and succinate may play a role in the Warburg effect providing that appropriate relative concentrations of the components are achieved under physiological conditions."

Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO, 2The abbreviations used are: CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CSA, cysteine sulfinic acid. EC 1.13.11.20) is a non-heme mononuclear iron metalloenzyme that catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) with addition of molecular oxygen (1Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Structure 1). This oxidative catabolism of cysteine initiates several important metabolic pathways related to pyruvate and several sulfurate compounds, including sulfate, hypotaurine, and taurine. CDO is expressed at appreciable levels in the brain, kidney, and lung, with extremely high levels in liver tissue (2Tsuboyama N. Hosokawa Y. Totani M. Oka J. Matsumoto A. Koide T. Kodama H.

Lee J.I. Stipanuk M.H. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the levels of cysteine decrease below this range, the increase of CDO ubiquitination rate results in rapid degradation of the ubiquitinated portion by the 26 S proteasome system (7Stipanuk M.H.

Intracellular free cysteine is cytotoxic and neuroexcitotoxic due to oxidative damage via formation of free radicals in the presence of iron (9Andine P. Orwar O. Jacobson I. Sandberg M. Hagberg H. J.

Elevated cysteine levels were reported previously in relation to several neurodegenerative diseases, including the well known Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases (12Heafield M.T. Fearn S. Steventon G.B.

CDO is considered to be involved in these diseases due to its function in regulating free cysteine levels. Sequence alignment classifies CDO as a member of the cupin superfamily (see Fig. 1), whose members possess what may be the most diverse range of functions, encompassing ∼18 subclasses. Nonetheless, neither of the exact characteristic conserved sequences, GX5HXHX3,4EX6GorGDX4PXGX2HX3N (17Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem.

Recently reported CDO structures from mouse and rat confirmed the cupin fold (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, recent structural studies of cupin proteins clearly demonstrate that the primary sequences of cupin motifs are not highly conserved, as was first believed (20Dunwell J.M. Purvis A. Khuri S.

J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28675-28682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Distinct from the other dioxygenases, CDO catalyzes an unusual oxidation reaction in which two oxygen atoms are added to a single atom without C-C bond cleavage in the substrate. CDO has been thoroughly studied functionally since it was first reported by Ewetz and colleagues (24Ewetz L. Sorbo B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 128: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to mammals, CDO was also found in other eukaryotes and prokaryotes by genome analysis (25Dominy Jr., J.E. Simmons C.R. Karplus P.A. Gehring A.M. Stipanuk M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although several mechanisms of CDO have recently been proposed on the basis of structural analysis or x-ray absorption spectroscopy results (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J.

In the case of eukaryotic CDOs, the highly conserved glutamic acid in cupin motif 1, mentioned above, is substituted by a cysteine, the thiol sulfur of which forms a thioether bond with the Cϵ of a nearby tyrosine residue (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Simmons C.R. Liu Q.

This rare Tyr-Cys adduct is termed “cross-linked protein derived cofactor” and was first reported in the crystal structure of galactose oxidase in 1991 (27Ito N. Phillips S.E. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Keen J.N. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Due to activation by the hydroxyl group on the phenol ring, it is easier for the ortho hydrogen atom to be substituted than in the absence of the hydroxyl group. In known protein structures, lysine and histidine are also found to be covalently bonded to tyrosine at the same ortho position (28Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 29Ostermeier C. Harrenga A. Ermler U.

Theoretical calculations showed similar chemical properties between different cross-linked protein derived cofactors involving tyrosine (30Okeley N.M. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R159-R171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to believe that Tyr-Cys and Tyr-His may share similar functions. To study the detailed mechanism of CDO, we co-crystallized CDO and its natural substrate, l-cysteine, and solved the structure of this complex. Based on preliminary structural analysis, several mutants of conserved residues were constructed to perform catalytic assays and detection of metal content. This work suggests a new mechanism for CDO activity, and some key roles for the Tyr-Cys cofactor in catalysis. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human CDO and Mutants—Full-length Homo sapiens CDO and mutants, including R60Q, R60A, C93S, C93A, Y157F, C164S, and C164A, were cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 expression vector (GE Healthcare) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Oxygen mixed in culture by vigorous shaking is beneficial for cell culture but harmful for maintaining the ferrous state of iron. Because ferric ions cannot be coordinated by the CDO active site, we added exogenous iron just before lysis instead of induction as reported in previous studies (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Chai S.C. Jerkins A.A. Banik J.J. Shalev I.

The harvested pellets were resuspended with 1 mm FeSO4 and immediately lysed by sonication to release glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused CDO and mutants, which were purified following standard GST fusion protein purification protocols. The GST tag was removed by cleavage with Pre-Scission Protease (GE Healthcare) during the purification of the GST-fused CDO. The liberated native CDO and mutants were further purified by gel-filtration chromatography in 20 mm sodium-4-morpholineethanesulfonic (Na-MES), 50 mm NaCl (pH 6.5) and were ultrafiltered to the required concentration for subsequent catalytic assays, detection of metal content, and crystallization. Wild-type CDO and mutants each showed a single peak in gel-filtration chromatography representing a monomeric protein, but Y157F showed an additional peak with an estimated molecular weight equivalent to a CDO dimer. The monomer form and the dimer form of Y157F were separated as two distinguished samples for further analysis. Crystallization—For co-crystallization experiments, l-cysteine was added to the purified wild-type CDO solution (20 mm MES, 50 mm NaCl, pH6.5) to a final concentration of 20 mm, as well as FeSO4 to 0.25 mm.A1-μl aliquot of the enzyme solution (10 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Na-cacodylate, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 17.6% polyethylene glycol 8000 (pH 6.5) and crystallized by the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method at 16 °C. The crystals grew as rods up to 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.8 mm in 1 week. After soaking in a cryoprotectant containing reservoir solution plus 10% glycerol for 1 min, the crystal was flash-frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored also in liquid nitrogen for future data collection using synchrotron radiation. Data Collection, Phasing, and Model Refinement—Crystallographic data for the complex crystal was collected with an SBC2 (3k × 3k) charge-coupled device detector at beamline BL19-ID of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) at 100 K. All x-ray diffraction intensity data were integrated, scaled, and merged using HKL2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Because other CDO structures with high homology have been reported, molecular replacement performed with CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) was employed for phasing using the crystal structure of mouse CDO as a starting model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2ATF) (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The final model was manually adjusted in O (34Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Aqvist J. Sundelin J. Eriksson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and refined with CNS. Mass Spectroscopy—Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy was carried out for metal content determination of the wild-type CDO and mutants. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy experiments were performed at the Analysis Center of Tsinghua University (Beijing, China). Catalytic Assay—l-Cysteine powder was dissolved into the same buffer as used for gel filtration. Freshly prepared human CDO solution and l-cysteine solution were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min. Appropriate amounts of these two solutions were well mixed to initiate the reaction in a 37 °C water bath. Details of the final concentrations in different experiments are given in Fig. 4. After a specified amount of time, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.5% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid. All aliquots were immediately ultrafiltered through Microcon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) 10,000 kDa molecular weight cut-off ultrafiltration tubes. The flow-through was kept in an ice water bath for further high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Determination of the catalysis product, l-CSA, was carried out via high performance liquid chromatography at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China). An Alltima (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) C18 column was used for ion-paired reversed-phase chromatography detected by UV at 215 nm with a mobile phase of 99.4:0.6 (v/v) water: methanol plus 0.3% (w/v) heptafluorobutyric acid as previously reported. Curves of initial reaction velocity versus substrate cysteine starting concentration were fitted to a Hill function with the Hill coefficient designated as 1.0 in OriginPro (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Values of Km and kcat for cysteine were subsequently estimated from the curves. In experiments conducted in the presence of inhibitors, the same reaction conditions were maintained for comparability. We used the same method for the mutagenesis catalytic assays with all eight mutant CDOs, including the Y157F dimer, at the same protein concentration of 0.031 mg/ml as wild-type human CDO. Structure Determination and Refinement—Initial analysis of the collected x-ray diffraction data indicated alternative possibilities of space groups P61 and P65. Molecular replacement calculations confirmed the latter space group, P65, as the correct one for the crystal of human CDO in complex with the substrate cysteine. The resulting electron-density map was continuous and interpretable. This space group differs from P43212, the space group previously reported for crystals of mouse CDO and rat CDO (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Simmons C.R. Liu Q.

In the asymmetric unit, there is only one human CDO molecule and one cysteine substrate with a high solvent content of 62.5%.

Open table in a new tab We are not the first group to attempt co-crystallization of CDO and cysteine. The reasons why we succeeded may be related to the unusually high cysteine concentration (20 mm) and the hard polyethylene glycol shells formed on the surfaces of hanging drops during crystallization, which prevents oxygen dissolving into the drops from the air. When the entire concentration of oxygen in the hanging drop (0.2 mm, according to theoretical calculations) was exhausted, the enzyme remains in the complex state with the cysteine substrate. Due to the reductive environment provided by the high concentration of cysteine, we considered that the iron center in the crystals was maintained in the ferrous state. Refinement of the crystal structure of human CDO in complex with the cysteine substrate led to a final model with a crystallographic R-factor (Rcryst) of 18.1% and a free R-factor (Rfree) of 21.5% at 2.7-Å resolution. Ten percent of the observed unique reflections were chosen at random for the test set. Sufficient electron density covers 185 residues (6-190), 1 Fe2+ ion, 1 substrate cysteine, 1 solution cysteine, and 131 water molecules, with B-factors < 65 Å2. Ten residues are missing from the N terminus, including five residues left after digestion with Pre-Scission Protease, as well as ten residues from the C terminus. Of 168 non-glycine and non-proline residues modeled, 148 residues fall within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and all remaining 20 residues lie in additionally allowed regions, whereas no residues are in generously allowed or disallowed regions. Refinement statistics are reported in Table 1. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB (entry 2IC1). Overall Structure—Human CDO comprises four helices (blue in Fig. 2A), including two α-helices (α1 and α2), one single-turn 310 helix (α4), one mixed helix with half α-helix and half 310 helix (α3), and thirteen β-strands that form two antiparallel β-sheets (yellow and brown in Fig. 2A) and one mixed β-sheet (red in Fig. 2A). As a member of the cupin superfamily, CDO possesses two β-strands, β3 and β4, corresponding, respectively, to βC and βD of cupin motif 1, as well as β7 and β8 to βG and βH of cupin motif 2, respectively. The structurally conserved cupin β-barrel is constituted by all the three β-sheets, by which the active center at the chelated Fe2+ is surrounded. Helices α1 and α2 are parallel to each other, and both lie perpendicular to α3. These three helices pack against the outside of the mixed β-sheet of the CDO β-barrel. Distinct from the general antiparallel β-barrel, with retinolbinding protein as a representative example (34Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Aqvist J. Sundelin J. Eriksson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), cupins share a barrel with an axis perpendicular to the direction of the β-strands that construct this barrel. For CDO, a cavity is formed along this axis from the protein surface to the coordinated ferrous ion at the active site (Fig. 2B). Calculated electrostatic potential distribution around the cavity shows a positively charged outer surface and a negatively charged inner surface. A high structural similarity among human CDO, mouse CDO, and rat CDO was observed. The latter two share the same amino acid sequence. With a primary sequence identity of 92%, crystal structures of human CDO and mouse CDO (PDB entry: 2ATF) share an r.m.s.d. of 0.74 Å for main-chain Cα atoms from Val-6 to Pro-190, as well as 0.72 Å between human and rat CDO (PDB entry: 2B5H) for the same region. Superposition of the backbones of human, mouse, and rat CDO reveals that the core regions around the active sites are more similar than the peripheral regions (Fig. 2C). Additionally, all heterogeneous residues among the three CDOs are distributed away from the active sites. Besides the cysteine substrate at the active site, another solution cysteine is included in the final model, which lies under the bottom of the β-barrel and is hydrogen-bonded to Arg-123, Gln-129, Tyr-132, and several waters. High B-factors for this cysteine molecule, resulting from a loose interaction with the enzyme surface, suggests its non-functionality in the thiol sulfur oxidation catalyzed by CDO. Active Site—The active site of human CDO is located at the Fe2+ ion coordinated by the Nϵ atoms of His-86, His-88, and His-140. All four atoms share similarly low B-factors (17-20 Å2), indicating high occupancy of the ferrous ion and stable conformation of this region. By contrast, the cysteine substrate in this active cavity, which coordinates Fe2+ via its amino nitrogen (trans to His-140) and thiol sulfur (trans to His-88), exhibits comparatively high B-factors (40-45 Å2). However, a clear difference Fourier electron-density map close to the metal center offers strong support for the reliability of this cysteine substrate that is additionally hydrogen-bonded to Arg-60, Tyr-58, Tyr-157, and His-155 in addition to coordination to the ferrous ion (Fig. 3A). The whole active site is sunk in a deep cavity under the protein surface. To clearly represent this cavity space, a cutaway stereo view from opposite directions is shown in Fig. 3 (B and C). In our crystal structure of human CDO in complex with cysteine, no stable water molecules or dioxygen molecules are found in the active cavity, although the bottom hydrophobic space of the cavity, trans to His-86-Nϵ, remains open and available for another ligand. In our proposed CDO mechanism, this site is to be occupied by the second substrate, molecular dioxygen. Distinct from all metal ion coordination modes of CDOs reported previously (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Simmons C.R. Liu Q.

Chem. 2006; 281: 18723-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), our work uncovered an unsaturated distorted tetragonal bipyramidal ferrous center with a vacant coordination site. To assess the differences in coordination geometry between human CDO, mouse CDO, and rat CDO, we measured the bond angles between the coordination bonds involving His-86, His-88, and His-140. The results showed that the bond angles are similar, especially between human CDO and rat CDO (<9°), both of which possess iron as the bound metal. In addition, the bond angles deviate from either octahedral or tetrahedral geometry. All of this evidence implies an alternate coordination mode at the active site of CDO. After preliminary refinement of our model, abnormally strong difference Fourier electron density was observed in two regions close to the active site. One region lies between Cys-93-Sγ and Tyr-157-Cϵ, and suggests a covalent bond between these two atoms, which is consistent with the observations by Simmons and McCoy in the rat CDO and mouse CDO structures (18McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Simmons C.R. Liu Q.

The bond angles around the sp2 carbon in the thioether bond were loosely restricted to 120° during refinement, and the C-S bond distance was restricted to 1.8 Å based on the thioether bond in galactose oxidase (27Ito N. Phillips S.E. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Keen J.N. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Another region is located close to the thiol group of Cys-164 and indicates a covalent modification involving Cys-164 (Fig. 3A). Because of its triangular shape, cysteine sulfinic acid, the product of the reaction catalyzed by CDO, was used to substitute Cys-164 to match this strong density. However, subsequent refinement failed due to unreasonably high B-factors of the two additional carboxylic oxygen atoms. Therefore, we had no alternative but to leave this region un-modeled in our final structure. Similarly undefined strong density against Cys-164-Sγ was reported in the rat CDO structure, which was co-crystallized together with cysteine (19Simmons C.R. Liu Q. Huang Q. Hao Q. Begley T.P.

https://openalex.org/W2013317185,"The mechanisms that cause tumors such as melanomas to metastasize into peripheral lymphatic capillaries are poorly defined. Non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms are lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) chemotaxis and proliferation in response to tumor cells (chemotaxis-lymphangiogenesis hypothesis) or LECs may secrete chemotactic agents that attract cancer cells (chemotactic metastasis hypothesis). Using migration assays, we found evidence supporting both hypotheses. Conditioned medium (CM) from metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM) cell lines attracted LEC migration, consistent with the lymphangiogenesis hypothesis. Conversely, CM from mixed endothelial cells or LECs, but not blood endothelial cells, attracted MMM cells but not non-metastatic melanoma cells, consistent with the chemotactic metastasis hypothesis. MMM cell lines expressed CCR7 receptors for the lymphatic chemokine CCL21 and CCL21 neutralizing antibodies prevented MMM chemotaxis in vitro. To test for chemotactic metastasis in vivo tumor cells were xenotransplanted into nude mice approximately 1 cm from an injected LEC depot. Two different MMM grew directionally towards the LECs, whereas non-metastatic melanomas did not. These observations support the hypothesis that MMM cells grow towards regions of high LEC density owing to chemotactic LEC secretions, including CCL21. This chemotactic metastasis may contribute to the close association between metastasizing tumor cells and peri-tumor lymphatic density and promote lymphatic invasion."

Because the mevalonate-independent pathway is absent in animals, it represents a promising target for the development of novel antibiotics, antimalarials, herbicides, and other drugs.

However, DXS is distinct from these other enzymes and represents a novel class of transketolase-like proteins (5Sprenger G.A. Schorken U. Wiegert T. Grolle S. de Graaf A.A. Taylor S.V. Begley T.P.

We report here the first crystal structures of DXS, from E. coli and Deinococcus radiodurans, in complex with the coenzyme TPP.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Expression and Purification—E. coli and D. radiodurans dxs were amplified from genomic DNA, inserted into vectors pET26b and pET28a, respectively, and overexpressed in E. coli at 20 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. E. coli DXS, with a C-terminal His tag, was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. D. radiodurans DXS, with an N-terminal His tag, was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The protein samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Selenomethionine-labeled E. coli DXS was produced in E. coli B834 cells (Novagen) grown in defined LeMaster medium (21Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) and purified following the same protocol as that for the native enzyme.Protein Crystallization—Crystals were obtained at room temperature with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Prior to crystallization, the DXS proteins were supplemented with 1 mm thiamine pyrophosphate and 5 mm MgCl2.Itwas discovered that the E. coli enzyme crystallized only after in situ proteolysis by a fungal protease, and SDS gels of the crystals showed two bands (at 20 and 40 kDa). The reservoir solution, containing 20% (w/v) PEG3350 and 200 mm Na,K-tartrate, had been infected by a fungus, and this in situ proteolysis was also crucial in the crystallization of two other proteins in our laboratory (22Mandel C.R. Gebauer D. Zhang H. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. 2006; F62: 1041-1045Google Scholar, 23Bai Y. Auperin T.C. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). The crystallization condition was optimized using this solution for the drop, and the reservoir solution contained 30% (w/v) PEG3350 and 200 mm Na,K-tartrate. The crystals were cryo-protected by 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K. They belong to space group P21 with cell parameters of a = 86.8 Å, b = 171.2 Å, c = 94.8 Å, and β = 107.2°. There are four molecules of DXS in the asymmetric unit.D. radiodurans DXS was crystallized against a reservoir solution containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm ammonium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, and 20% (w/v) PEG6000 or PEG8000. The crystals were cryo-protected by 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. They belong to space group P21 with cell parameters of a = 78.3 Å, b = 154.1 Å, c = 124.9 Å, and β = 98.9°. There are four molecules of DXS in the asymmetric unit.Data Collection and Processing—A selenomethionyl single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set to 2.4 Å resolution was collected at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source on a CCD detector. A native data set to 2.9 Å resolution was collected at the X4C beamline of National Synchrotron Light Source on a MarResearch image plate detector. The diffraction data were processed with the HKL package (see Table 1) (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Two sites were identified by the program Solve in the first cycle (25Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). By feeding these two sites back to Solve, six sites were identified. Starting with these six sites, Solve was able to locate 76 selenium atoms, and Resolve could automatically trace about 80% of the asymmetric unit after phase improvement. The atomic model was completed manually using O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar), and the structure refinement was carried out with CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The E. coli DXS structure, modified to have the same sequence as D. radiodurans DXS with the program Spdbv (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar), was used as the search model. The refinement was carried out with Refmac (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13781) Google Scholar), incorporating TLS refinements.DXS Assay—DXS activity was determined using an end point assay. The pyruvate substrate remaining after the reaction was converted to lactate with lactate dehydrogenase, and the concomitant consumption of NADH was determined by fluorescence. The assays were performed in 384-well microtiter plates (Greiner), and each well contained 25 μl of substrate solution (50 μm NADH, 60 μm pyruvate, 60 μm GAP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 600 μm TPP, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5)), 5 μl of water, and 20 μl of enzyme in a buffer of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 600 μm TPP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min at room temperature. Then 50 μl of 5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase was added, and NADH fluorescence was determined 5 min later.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure Determination—The crystal structure of E. coli DXS was determined at 2.4 Å resolution by the selenomethionyl single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method (Table 1) (31Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). We discovered that in situ proteolysis by a fungal protease was essential for the crystallization of this protein (22Mandel C.R. Gebauer D. Zhang H. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. 2006; F62: 1041-1045Google Scholar, 23Bai Y. Auperin T.C. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar), and two segments of the enzyme, residues 183–238 and 292–317, had no electron density. The remaining parts of the enzyme, 1–182, 239–291, and 318–620 are consistent with the 20- and 40-kDa species observed in SDS gels of the crystals (the 239–291 segment is too small to be visible in the gels), confirming that the two missing segments were removed by the fungal protease. Unfortunately, the first segment is located near the active site, and the second segment is the linker between two domains of the enzyme. Consequently, there was ambiguity about the active site and the domain organization of DXS based on this structure (see below).To determine the structure of unmodified DXS, we screened through six DXS proteins from other bacterial sources and found that the enzyme from D. radiodurans could be overexpressed in E. coli and purified. Moreover, this enzyme could be crystallized without the need for in situ proteolysis, which allowed us to determine the structure of full-length DXS (Table 1). Clear electron density was observed for the segment linking two domains in the structure (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Final 2Fo - Fc electron density for the linker between domains I and II of D. radiodurans DXS, contoured at 1 σ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The refined atomic models have good agreement with the observed diffraction data and the expected bond lengths and bond angles (Table 1). The majority of the residues are located in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot. The DXS monomers in both crystals have similar conformations, with root mean square distance of 0.4 Å among their equivalent Cα atoms. Moreover, the structures of the E. coli and D. radiodurans DXS enzymes are also similar, with root mean square distances of 0.7 Å among their equivalent Cα atoms, consistent with their significant sequence conservation (46% amino acid sequence identity; Fig. 1B).Structure of DXS—The structure of DXS monomer can be divided into three domains, I, II, and III (Fig. 3). All three domains have the α/β fold, with a central, mostly parallel β-sheet that is sandwiched by α-helices (supplemental Fig. S1). Domain I (residues 1–319) contains a five-stranded parallel β-sheet, and domain II (residues 320–495) contains a six-stranded parallel β-sheet. Domain III (residues 496–629) contains a five-stranded β-sheet, but the first strand is anti-parallel to the other four strands. The larger size of domain I is due to several extended surface segments (supplemental Fig. S1) at the N terminus (residues 1–49), after the first strand (residues 81–122), and in the connection between the fourth and fifth strands (residues 184–250). In fact, this connection is one of the two segments in E. coli DXS that were removed by proteolysis during crystallization (Fig. 3B). In the structure of D. radiodurans DXS, residues 199–242 in this connection are also disordered (Fig. 3A). However, the beginning of this connection is ordered in this structure, and some of these residues are located in the active site (especially residues Asn183 and Met185; see below).FIGURE 3Crystal structures of DXS.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Each monomer contributes more than 3,900 Å2 of surface area to the dimer interface, which is mostly hydrophobic in nature. The two DXS monomers are arranged side-by-side in the dimer, such that each domain of one monomer is in contact with its equivalent in the other monomer (Fig. 3A). The structure of the E. coli DXS dimer (Fig. 3B) is similar to that of the D. radiodurans DXS dimer (Fig. 3A), with root mean square distances of 1.0 Å among their equivalent Cα atoms.A Novel Dimer Organization in DXS—The domains of DXS bear significant structural similarity to that of several other proteins, as identified by the program Dali (34Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar). The closest structural homologs include transketolase (TK; Fig. 4A) (35Nikkola M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 subunit (Fig. 4B) (36Arjunan P. Nemeria N. Brunskill A. Chandrasekhar K. Sax M. Yan Y.

These proteins share roughly 20% amino acid sequence identity and catalyze similar biochemical reactions (5Sprenger G.A. Schorken U. Wiegert T. Grolle S. de Graaf A.A. Taylor S.V. Begley T.P.

The images were produced with PyMol (44DeLano W.L. PyMol. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, the three domains in the DXS monomer are arranged differently as compared with TK and PDH. As a result, the organization of the dimer is also different. In the DXS dimer, domain I of one monomer is located directly above domains II and III of the same monomer (Fig. 3A). In contrast, domain I in one monomer is located above domains II and III of the other monomer in the dimers of TK (Fig. 4A) and PDH (Fig. 4B). An important consequence of the difference in dimer organization is that the active site in DXS is located within the same monomer, whereas that in TK and PDH is located at the interface between two monomers (see below).One reason for the difference in domain organization may be the exceptionally long linker (95 residues) between domains I and II in TK (Fig. 4A) and PDH (Fig. 4B). In comparison, DXS contains only 20 residues in this linker (Fig. 3A), which is too short for DXS to assume the same domain organization as in TK and PDH. This linker was removed by proteolysis in the E. coli DXS structure (Fig. 3B). However, we observed clear electron density for this linker in the D. radiodurans DXS structure (Fig. 2), and there is no ambiguity in the connectivity between the two domains in DXS.Residues 199–243 in domain I of D. radiodurans DXS are not observed in the structure, very likely because of disorder. This missing segment is located close to the dimer interface (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the possibility of a domain-swapped connection in this segment between the two monomers, linking residue 198 in one domain with 244 in the other domain (supplemental Fig. S3), cannot be completely excluded based on the current structural information. With such a connection, the dimer organization of DXS would be similar to that in TK and PDH, although domain I would then have a novel, domain-swapped organization.The Active Site of DXS—The active site of DXS is located at the interface between domains I and II of the same monomer, with no direct contribution from residues in the other monomer of the dimer (Fig. 5A). The central parallel β-sheets of the two domains are oriented such that their C-terminal ends are pointed toward each other, and the TPP coenzyme is located at the bottom of a pocket in this interface (Fig. 5B). Residues in the active site are highly conserved among the DXS enzymes (Fig. 1B), and many of them are also conserved in TK and PDH (supplemental Table S1). This conservation is supported by observations that the dxs-null lethal phenotype in E. coli can be rescued by a PDH mutant (E636Q; see below) (38Sauret-Gueto S. Uros E.M. Ibanez E. Boronat A.

There are mixed reports on whether modification of the interaction with FcRn can be used as an engineering strategy to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of monoclonal antibodies. We tested whether the T250Q/M428L mutations, which improved the pharmacokinetics of humanized IgGs in the rhesus monkey, would translate to a pharmacokinetic benefit in both cynomolgus monkeys and mice when constructed on a different humanized IgG framework (anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)). The T250Q/M428L anti-TNFα variant displayed an ∼40-fold increase in binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey FcRn (C-FcRn) at pH 6.0, with maintenance of the pH binding dependence. We also constructed another anti-TNFα variant (P257I/Q311I) whose binding kinetics with the C-FcRn was similar to that of the T250Q/M428L variant. The binding affinity of the T250Q/M428L variant for murine FcRn was increased ∼500-fold, with maintenance of pH dependence. In contrast to the interaction with C-FcRn, this interaction was driven mainly by a decrease in the rate of dissociation. Despite the improved in vitro binding properties of the anti-TNFα T250Q/M428L and P257I/Q311I variants to C-FcRn, the pharmacokinetic profiles of these molecules were not differentiated from the wild-type antibody in cynomolgus monkeys after intravenous administration. When administered intravenously to mice, the T250Q/M428L anti-TNFα variant displayed improved pharmacokinetics, characterized by an ∼2-fold slower clearance than the wild-type antibody. The discrepancy between these data and previously reported benefits in rhesus monkeys and the inability of these mutations to translate to improved kinetics across species may be related to a number of factors. We propose extending consideration to differences in the absolute IgG-FcRn affinity, the kinetics of the IgG/FcRn interaction, and differences in the relative involvement of this pathway in the context of other factors influencing the disposition or elimination of monoclonal antibodies.

The proven efficacy of these molecular entities in combination with advances in protein engineering and directed evolution strategies has led to efforts to optimize the functional activity of these biologic agents. The goal of many of these approaches is to improve patient convenience and safety by reducing dose and/or dose frequency and potentially to improve efficacy (1Kim S.J. Park Y. Hong H.J. Mol. Cells. 2005; 20: 17-29PubMed Google Scholar). Many reports have suggested that improvement in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of humanized monoclonal antibodies may be gained through modification of the interaction of the Fc region of IgGs with FcRn (2Ghetie V.

It has been proposed that optimizing the properties of the receptor interaction may alter the intracellular trafficking of IgGs resulting in reduced clearance and increased half-life in vivo (7Ober R.J.

Because these pharmacokinetic improvements can translate to enhanced or broadened therapeutic utility of a particular mAb, it has been of primary interest to understand aspects of the IgG/FcRn interaction that can serve as the basis of a rational and universal protein engineering strategy. FcRn has been shown to be involved in the transcytosis of IgGs across epithelium allowing transfer of IgG from mother to offspring (10Cianga P. Medesan C. Richardson J.A. Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Eur. J.

Considerable evidence also exists to support the role of FcRn in regulating levels of circulating IgGs in rodents and higher species (2Ghetie V. Popov S. Borvak J. Radu C. Matesoi D. Medesan C.

Whereas IgG can bind to FcRn via the Fc region at pH 6.0, no direct binding occurs at neutral pH, and dissociation of the IgG·FcRn complex is also facilitated at neutral pH (13Wallace K.H. Rees A.R. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Raghavan M. Bonagura V.R. Morrison S.L. Bjorkman P.J.

The pH dependence of this interaction has served as the basis for the currently proposed mechanism of intracellular IgG trafficking and recycling. In short, it is believed that that IgG uptake into the cell occurs via fluid phase pinocytosis with IgG subsequently binding to FcRn in the acidified environment of the endosomal compartment (7Ober R.J.

FcRn-bound antibody is thought to be protected from degradation by following a recycling pathway to the cell surface where the neutral pH facilitates dissociation and release of IgG into the circulation (7Ober R.J. Martinez C. Lai X. Zhou J. Ward E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11076-11081Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Ober R.J. Martinez C. Vaccaro C. Zhou J. Ward E.S. J.

Unbound IgG, in contrast, is believed to be directed down a degradative pathway resulting in proteolysis in lysosomes (7Ober R.J. Martinez C. Lai X. Zhou J. Ward E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11076-11081Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Ober R.J. Martinez C. Vaccaro C. Zhou J. Ward E.S. J.

The proportion of IgG processed through the recycling versus degradative pathways is believed to be important in determining the persistence of an IgG in the circulation (8Ober R.J. Martinez C. Vaccaro C. Zhou J. Ward E.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2021-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Given the presumed mechanism of FcRn intracellular trafficking, the foundation of engineering strategies aimed at improving the pharmacokinetic characteristics of an antibody has been to increase the affinity of an IgG for FcRn at pH 6.0 while maintaining the pH dependence of the interaction (3Hinton P.R.

Several reports have suggested that Fc sequences or mutations in the Fc region associated with an increase in the affinity of the IgG/FcRn interaction at pH 6.0 directly relate to differences observed in the terminal phase half-life (t½β) of these antibodies in vivo (2Ghetie V.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, results from a number of more recent investigations have provided data that appear to contradict this premise, putting into question whether a direct relationship exists between FcRn affinity and in vivo clearance (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22Dall'Acqua W.F. Woods R.M. Ward E.S. Palaszynski S.R. Patel N.K.

Immunol. 2006; 43: 1462-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Given these discrepancies, the broader conclusions from these investigations remain equivocal. Adding to this ambiguity is the very limited data that have been published on the relevance of this receptor interaction to the in vivo kinetic properties of an antibody in primates. Recent reports have provided evidence that specific mutations (T250Q/M428L, M428L, and M252Y/S254T/T256E) 3Residues are numbered according to the Eu numbering system. T250Q/M428L indicates mutation of both Thr250 to Glu250 and Met428 to Leu428. M252Y/S254T/T256E indicates mutation of Met252 to Try252, Ser254 to Thr254, and Thr256 to Glu256. P257I/Q311I indicates mutation of both Pro257 to Ile257 and Glu311 to Ile311. M428L indicates mutation of Met428 to Leu428. to a humanized IgG1 and/or IgG2, which increased their affinity for FcRn at pH 6.0, resulted in a longer kinetic elimination phase half-life in either cynomolgus or rhesus monkeys (3Hinton P.R. Johlfs M.G. Xiong J.M. Hanestad K. Ong K.C. Bullock C. Keller S. Tang M.T. Tso J.Y. Vasquez M. Tsurushita N. J. Biol.

In a separate study, however, Fc mutations that imparted similar affinity improvements and in vitro binding properties to a humanized IgG1 did not translate to in vivo kinetic benefit in cynomolgus monkeys (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data do not convincingly support the notion that a rational engineering strategy to positively influence the in vivo kinetics of a broad range of antibody therapeutics can be based on modulating characteristics of the IgG/FcRn interaction. In this study, we tested whether the double Fc mutation (T250Q/M428L), which had been demonstrated previously to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of humanized IgGs in the rhesus monkey, would translate to a similar benefit when constructed on a different IgG framework. Fc variants were built on an anti-TNFα IgG1 antibody backbone with the intent of eliminating/limiting the influence of antigen binding on the kinetics or distribution of the antibody. We constructed the anti-TNFα T250Q/M428L variant along with a second variant, anti-TNFα (P257I/Q311I). 3Residues are numbered according to the Eu numbering system. T250Q/M428L indicates mutation of both Thr250 to Glu250 and Met428 to Leu428. M252Y/S254T/T256E indicates mutation of Met252 to Try252, Ser254 to Thr254, and Thr256 to Glu256. P257I/Q311I indicates mutation of both Pro257 to Ile257 and Glu311 to Ile311. M428L indicates mutation of Met428 to Leu428. The T250Q/M428L mutations resulted in an increased pH 6.0 binding affinity, with maintenance of pH binding dependence, in a fashion very similar to that reported previously (3Hinton P.R. Johlfs M.G. Xiong J.M. Hanestad K. Ong K.C. Bullock C. Keller S. Tang M.T. Tso J.Y. Vasquez M. Tsurushita N. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2006; 176: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, the in vitro binding characteristics of the anti-TNFα P257I/Q311I variant were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of the anti-TNFα T250Q/M428L variant. However, the pharmacokinetic profiles of the anti-TNFα T250Q/M428L and P257I/Q311I were not differentiated from the wild-type (WT) anti-TNFα molecule after intravenous administration to cynomolgus monkeys. These observations suggest that engineering strategies to improve the in vivo kinetic performance of an IgG need to consider the FcRn interaction in appropriate context with other factors (biophysical properties, antigen load, glycosylation, and proteolytic stability), which may influence the disposition or elimination of a particular monoclonal antibody therapeutic. Cell Culture—293EBNA cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5–8% CO2 conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml nucellin (Lilly), 0.4 μg/ml tropolone (Sigma), 0.075% (w/v) F68 (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml Geneticin (Sigma). Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The P257I/Q311I antibody variant was derived from a humanized IgG1 Fc variant library created using a Kunkel-based strategy (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) described earlier for other anti-TNFα Fc variants (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The T250Q/M428L variant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the WT anti-TNFα clone using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The WT, P257I/Q311I, and T250Q/M428L anti-TNFα IgGs were expressed in 293EBNA cells and purified from culture supernatants using protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography methods described previously for other anti-TNFα antibodies (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recombinant, soluble cynomolgus monkey FcRn (C-FcRn) and murine FcRn (M-FcRn) were expressed in 293EBNA cells transfected with the plasmids encoding for the soluble portion of each receptor species αFcRn and β2-microglobulin, and the proteins were purified as described previously (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Isolation of Endogenous Cynomolgus Monkey and Murine IgG—Recombinant protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) were used to isolate IgG from predose samples of cynomolgus monkey serum and CD-1 mouse plasma, respectively. Both protein A and G bind to each IgG subtype in the respective species. Briefly, columns were packed with either 2 ml of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose for isolation of primate or mouse IgG, respectively. Monkey serum or CD-1 mouse plasma (1 ml) was then allowed to flow over the column by gravity. The columns were washed with 1 mm potassium phosphate, 3 mm sodium phosphate, 0.150 m NaCl (pH 7.4) until the absorbance (A280) returned to base line. Bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 3.2), and fractions were neutralized using 40 μl of 1 m Tris (pH 8.0) per ml of elution buffer. Fractions containing the antibodies were pooled and characterized by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Coomassie Blue-stained gels indicated that the IgGs from both species were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity and displayed the characteristic heavy and light chain bands for each IgG. The purified IgGs were dialyzed into PBS, and the samples were sterile-filtered (0.22 μm) and stored at 4 °C. Quantification of the Endogenous (Steady-state) IgG Concentrations in Cynomolgus Monkeys and CD-1 Mice—Total IgG levels in cynomolgus monkey serum and CD-1 mouse plasma were determined by ELISA using pre-dose samples from the animals used in the pharmacokinetic studies. Briefly, for determining the IgG levels in mouse or primate, each well of an Immulon 4 microtiter plate (Thermo Electron Corp.) was coated overnight at 4 °C with either 0.2 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (heavy chain-specific; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or donkey anti-human IgG (Fcγ chain-specific; Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively. After washing and blocking, standards and samples were added to the wells in a volume of 0.1 ml and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Dilutions (1:10,000–1: 160,000) of cynomolgus monkey serum or mouse plasma samples were made in 1% (w/v) casein in PBS prior to addition to the appropriate wells. Bound mouse and monkey IgGs were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively. The goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) purified recombinant murine and human IgG1 were used to generate standard curves for determining the concentrations of endogenous IgG in CD-1 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. The dilutions for both the primate and murine samples displayed linearity indicating there was no assay interference with the reagents used for sample capture or detection. The concentration of isolated endogenous murine and cynomolgus monkey IgG was also determined by measuring the ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 1.4 mg/ml for each IgG. The endogenous murine and cynomolgus IgG concentrations determined by ELISA and ultraviolet spectrophotometry were equivalent, indicating the ELISA reagents used to quantify the IgG concentrations reacted adequately with the murine and cynomolgus monkey IgG. IgG/FcRn Binding Affinity Measurements with Surface Plasmon Resonance (BIAcore)—The interaction of WT anti-TNFα and the P257I/Q311I and T250Q/M428L variants with recombinant, immobilized human-FcRn, C-FcRn, and M-FcRn was monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore Inc.) as described previously (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The interactions with isolated endogenous C-IgG and endogenous M-IgG were characterized in the same fashion. In short, C-FcRn, and M-FcRn were immobilized to flow cells 3 and 4, respectively, of a CM5 sensor chip using amine-coupling chemistry. The surface density of each receptor species was 275–350 response units. The first flow cell was used as a blank control surface lacking FcRn and was prepared similarly to the other flow cells (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All binding experiments were performed with the WT and Fc variant IgGs dissolved in PBS (pH 6.0), 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 over a concentration range of 0.0033 to 4 μm as described for previous studies (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The binding data were obtained by subtracting the signal of flow cell 1 from the other two flow cells. Kinetic binding constants were determined through global fits of the average of two data sets collected on separate days using BIAevaluation, version 3.1. The kinetics (association and dissociation rates) were simultaneously fit to a heterogeneous binding model to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) value for each FcRn/IgG interaction (30Martin W.L. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12639-12647Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The data curves for each phase of the sensorgrams had low residuals and χ2 values. pH-dependent Dissociation ELISA for the WT, P257I/Q311I, and T250Q/M428L Anti-TNFα Antibodies—Biotinylated C-FcRn and M-FcRn for ELISAs were produced by reacting each purified soluble protein with EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) using the conditions supplied by the vendor, and the FcRn:biotin ratio was measured as 1.0 and 1.0, respectively, using the EZ™ biotin quantitation kit (Pierce). The pH-dependent ELISA for the interaction of each receptor species with the WT, P257I/Q311I, and T250Q/M428L anti-TNFα antibodies was performed as described in earlier studies with other variant anti-TNFα IgGs (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Optical density data were analyzed by the same four-parameter nonlinear regression fit as described previously (21Datta-Mannan A. Witcher D.R. Tang Y. Watkins J. Wroblewski V.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to determine the midpoint (pH50, where 50% of the FcRn-antibody complexes dissociate) of the titration curve (the pH at which 50% of the FcRn-antibody complexes dissociate). At each pH, data are expressed as the percentage of the total antibody bound at pH 6.0. Cynomolgus Monkey Pharmacokinetic Studies—Two independent cynomolgus monkey pharmacokinetic studies were performed. In both studies, six male cynomolgus monkeys (2.8–3.8 kg) were assig"

Here, we report a critical role for dual oxidase 1 (Duox1), a newly identified NADPH oxidase homolog within the tracheobronchial epithelium, in airway epithelial cell migration and repair following injury. Activation of Duox1 during epithelial injury is mediated by cellular release of ATP, which signals through purinergic receptors expressed on the epithelial cell surface. Purinergic receptor stimulation by extracellular ATP is a critical determinant of epithelial cell migration and repair following injury and is associated with activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Stimulation of these integral features of epithelial cell migration and repair processes was found to require the activation of Duox1.

Of the two known Duox isoforms, Duox1 is primarily expressed within the ciliated epithelium and believed to be responsible for epithelial H2O2 production after cell stimulation (5Forteza R. Salathe M. Miot F. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), whereas Duox2 has been localized to salivary or submucosal glands, thus constituting a functional host defense system with co-localized lactoperoxidase (4Geiszt M.

Science. 2005; 310: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), a direct role for Duox1/2 in host defense has not yet been directly demonstrated, and other functions of airway epithelial Duox1 have been postulated (6Schwarzer C.

Persson C.G. Thorax. 1997; 52: 1010-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have implicated ATP in in vitro cell migration and/or proliferation in various cell types through purinergic signaling (14Klepeis V.E. Weinger I. Kaczmarek E. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1115-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Dignass A.U. Becker A. Spiegler S. nd Goebell H. Eur J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 28: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, NADPH oxidases have been linked to endothelial or smooth muscle cell migration (22Moldovan L. Moldovan N.I. Sohn R.H. Parikh S.A. Gold-schmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether ATP release mediates airway epithelial cell migration and wound repair following injury and investigated the potential involvement of Duox1 activation in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human primary tracheobronchial epithelium (NHBE) cells were obtained from Clonetics (Cambrex Biosciences, Walkersville, MD) and used at passages 3-5. For experiments, NHBE cells were cultured to confluence in 24-well plates or 8-well chamber slides (Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE1), kindly provided by Drs. R. Wu and J. Yankaskas, were cultured in Ham's F-12 nutrient medium supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 μm), cholera toxin (10 ng/ml), and bovine hypothalamus extract (15 μg/ml), as described previously (23Okamoto T. Valacchi G. Gohil K. Akaike T. van der Vliet A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and grown to confluence in 24-well plates or chamber slides for experimentation, unless otherwise indicated.In Vitro Wound Assay—In vitro injury was induced in NHBE or HBE1 monolayers by creating 1-2 linear scratches of ±0.2 mm wide, after which detached cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium was added. Wound closure was followed over 24 h, using a phase contrast microscope interfaced with a digital camera, and initial and remaining wound areas were determined using NIH Image J software for calculation of the percentage of wound closure. Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents used in these studies were from Sigma.Transwell Cell Migration Assay—HBE1 cells (1 × 105) were placed in Boyden-like chambers containing 10-mm polycarbonate membrane inserts (8 μm pore size) (Nunc International), which were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen) for 60 min. Following incubation for 4 h at 37 °C to allow cell adhesion, test reagents were added or cells were transfected with Duox1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or negative siRNA control. Untreated and siRNA-treated cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, after which non-migrated cells were removed from the membranes with a cotton swab. The remaining migrated cells were stained with crystal violet and extracted in 200 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) for analysis of absorbance (A) at 540 nm.Total RNA Isolation and Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). The cDNAs synthesized from total RNA (2 μg) using superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used as templates for RT-PCR reaction. The primer set used for Duox1 amplification was 5′-GCA GGA CAT CAA CCC TGC ACT CTC-3′ and 5′-CTG CCA TCT ACC ACA CGG ATC TGC-3′ and for Duox2 amplification was 5′-GAT GGT GAC CGC TAC TGG TT-3′ and 5′-GCC ACC ACT CCA GAG AGA AG-3′. GAPDH amplification using the primer set 5′-ATC TTC CAG GAG CGA GAT CC-3′ and 5′-ACC ACT GAC ACG TTG GCA GT-3′ was used as the control. PCR amplifications were carried out in 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (58 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), and the products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels.Silencing of Duox1 Expression by RNA Interference Assay—Expression of Duox1 was silenced using predesigned siRNA (catalog number 16708) from Ambion RNA Company (Austin, TX). Negative control siRNAs that have no significant sequence similarity to mouse, rat, or human gene sequences and functionally proven to have minimal effects on cell proliferation and viability (silencer negative control number 1 siRNA, catalog number 4611, Ambion) were used as controls. HBE1 cells were transfected with 100 nm Duox1 and negative control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) 72 h prior to experimentation. Effects on Duox1 expression were verified by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis of Duox protein, which was detected using polyclonal antibodies against Duox (kindly provided by Drs. J. David Lambeth and Francoise Miot) and visualized using a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME).Measurement of ATP Release—ATP release into the medium was monitored using a luciferase/luciferin bioluminescence ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent HBE1 cell monolayers in 24-well plates were wounded and immediately placed in 1 ml of fresh medium. At various time points, aliquots (100 μl) were analyzed with luciferase/luciferin in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Oak Ridge, TN). The amount of ATP released was calculated using external ATP standards (1-1000 nm).Analysis of Epithelial H2O2 Production—Confluent HBE1 cell monolayers were incubated in the presence of l-tyrosine (1 mm) and lactoperoxidase (10 μg/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution and production of H2O2 was measured via lactoperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of tyrosine to o,o′-dityrosine, which was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (24van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). This assay is sensitive and allows detection of as little as 1 nm H2O2. For analysis of cellular H2O2 production in situ, confluent HBE1 cells in chamber slides were preincubated with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) for 15 min, after which the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and wounded. DCF fluorescence was monitored 30 min after wounding using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) connected to a RT Slider Spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Images were generated using the software SPOT, version 3.2.Analysis of ERK1/2 Activation—Confluent HBE1 cell monolayers in 24-well plates were wounded by creating several scratches in a cross pattern. Cell lysates were collected 10 min after wounding, and phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated ERK (ppERK) and total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), which were visualized using horseradish-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Alternatively, HBE1 cell monolayers in chamber slides were wounded and fixed after 10 min of incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min at room temperature), after which slides were blocked for 45 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained with a polyclonal antibody against phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technololgy; 1:100 dilution for 45 min) and a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (red) secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories). Phospho-ERK1/2 immunostaining was visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U).Analysis of MMP-9 Expression and Activity—MMP-9 expression in HBE1 cells was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR, as described previously (23Okamoto T. Valacchi G. Gohil K. Akaike T. van der Vliet A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gelatinase activity in injured HBE1 cells was determined using an in situ zymography procedure based on proteolytic cleavage of a fluorescently labeled gelatin substrate, DQ-gelatin (Invitrogen). Confluent HBE1 cells in multichamber slides were wounded and incubated for 24 h, after which cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml DQ-gelatin for 2 h at 37 °C, washed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.RESULTSATP Release Promotes Epithelial Cell Migration by Purinergic Signaling—To investigate the signaling mechanisms in epithelial cell migration and repair, we used an in vitro model of epithelial injury, which involves generating a linear scratch of ±0.2 mm width in confluent monolayers of either NHBE cells or immortalized human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (HBE1). Because chemical or mechanical epithelial cell injury is known to promote release of ATP by as yet incompletely defined mechanisms (19Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 25Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), we first determined ATP release in response to linear scratch injury in confluent HBE1 cell monolayers. Indeed, extracellular ATP levels rapidly increased following epithelial wounding and reached a maximum after 15-20 min, thereafter declining rapidly to near normal levels after 40 min (Fig. 1A). The gradual rise in extracellular ATP levels is indicative of an active mechanism of ATP release from remaining cells after linear wounding. The rapid decline in extracellular ATP is most likely due to its hydrolysis by cell surface ecto-ATPases (19Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Accordingly, extracellular ATP persisted longer in the presence of the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase inhibitor β,γ-methylene ATP (300 μm; data not shown), consistent with previous findings (26Joseph S.M. Pifer M.A. Przybylski R.J. Dubyak G.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 1002-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).We next determined the contribution of ATP to the rate or extent of wound closure after linear injury to NHBE or HBE1 monolayers. Although these cells normally rapidly migrate into the wound area to cause almost complete wound closure within 24 h (Fig. 1B, panels a and b), the extent of wound closure was markedly inhibited in the presence of two different P2 purinergic receptor antagonists, suramin and Cibracon blue (reactive blue 2) (Fig. 1, B (panel c) and C). Epithelial wound closure was also markedly attenuated in the presence of the ATPase/ADPase apyrase, indicating the involvement of extracellular ATP (Fig. 1, B (panel d) and C). In contrast, the addition of hexokinase, which converts ATP to ADP, did not affect wound closure, presumably because ADP is also an agonist for P2 receptors and capable of promoting epithelial migration. Consistent with a stimulatory role of released ATP on epithelial wound closure, the addition of exogenous ATP (1-10 μm) or its non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS (1 μm) also enhanced wound closure in HBE1 cells (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, higher concentrations of ATP or ATPγS inhibited wound closure, consistent with earlier findings in other cell types (14Klepeis V.E. Weinger I. Kaczmarek E. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1115-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), presumably because of nonspecific effects due to the persistent presence of higher extracellular concentrations of these purines. Because wound closure in this in vitro injury model is an integrated process of cell migration and proliferation, we used a Transwell cell migration assay to more directly determine the effects of ATP-dependent signaling on epithelial cell migration (27Wesley U.V. McGroarty M. Homoyouni A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, migration of HBE1 cells across the Transwell membrane was markedly inhibited by treatment with the P2 receptor antagonists suramin and reactive blue 2 and in the presence of apyrase (Fig. 1E). Moreover, HBE1 cell migration could be stimulated by the addition of exogenous ATP, an effect that could be reversed by suramin (Fig. 1F).Extracellular ATP Generates Epithelial H2O2 Production by Activation of Duox1—Recent studies have shown that P2 receptor stimulation by extracellular ATP enhances cellular H2O2 production in various cell types, including bronchial epithelial cells (5Forteza R.

To determine the contribution of P2 receptor activation to H2O2 generation in bronchial epithelial cells, we monitored cellular H2O2 production using a high pressure liquid chromatography-based assay. Consistent with earlier findings (5Forteza R. Salathe M. Miot F. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the addition of exogenous ATP (10-100 μm) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in H2O2 production by both NHBE cells or HBE1 cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the addition of exogenous ATP (10-100 μm) also enhanced fluorescence in HBE1 cells that were preloaded with the oxidant-sensitive fluorescence indicator 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), indicating increased H2O2 production (not shown). Moreover, epithelial production of extracellular H2O2 was enhanced after linear scratch injury in confluent HBE1 cell monolayers, and this was attenuated in the presence of the P2 receptor antagonist suramin or the ATPase/ADPase apyrase (Fig. 2B), consistent with involvement of ATP release and P2 receptor stimulation in cellular H2O2 production. Because only a small fraction of cells was expected to be stimulated in this scratch wound model, we determined localized H2O2 production in injured cell monolayers using fluorescence microscopy after cell preloading with H2DCF-DA prior to wounding. Indeed, we observed localized DCF fluorescence after linear wounding of H2DCF-DA-loaded cells primarily in cells at the wound edge (Fig. 2C, panels a-d). Again, this was largely suppressed in the presence of either suramin or apyrase (Fig. 2C, panels e-h), indicating the involvement of ATP/ADP-mediated P2 receptor activation.FIGURE 2ATP-mediated H2O2 production in bronchial epithelial cells. A, confluent NHBE (black bars) or HBE1 cells (white bars) in 24-well plates were placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mm l-tyrosine and 10 μg/ml lactoperoxidase. After 30 min, the cells were stimulated with the indicated concentration of ATP for an additional 30 min, and dityrosine in the medium was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as a measure of H2O2 production (24van der Vliet A.

Data (mean ± S.E.; n = 3) are presented relative to H2O2 production by unstimulated cells typically ranging from 0.1-0.5 nmol/30 min/106 cells (*, p < 0.05 compared with corresponding controls). B, confluent HBE1 monolayers in 24-well plates were wounded by two linear scratches, and H2O2 production was monitored 30 min after wounding in the absence or presence of suramin (100 μm) or apyrase (10 units/ml) (mean ± S.E.; n = 3; *, p < 0.05 compared with control). C, fluorescence analysis of cellular H2O2 production by HBE1 cells preloaded with the oxidant-sensitive probe H2DCF-DA (Molecular Probes; 10 μm for 30 min). HBE1 cell monolayers were wounded, and after removal of detached cells, the remaining cells were incubated for an additional 30 min in the absence (c and d) or presence of suramin (100 μm) (e and f) or apyrase (10 units/ml) (g and h). Representative bright field (a, c, e, and g) and fluorescence (b, d, f, and h) images of at least duplicate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)According to several recent studies, airway epithelial production of H2O2 originates primarily from activation of the recently identified NADPH oxidase homologs, Duox1 and Duox2 (3Harper R.W.

Biol. 2005; 32: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3A, NHBE or HBE1 cells express primarily Duox1 and to a lesser extent Duox2, consistent with previous findings suggesting that Duox1 is the major enzyme responsible for airway epithelial H2O2 production (5Forteza R. Salathe M. Miot F. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Schwarzer C. Machen T.E. Illek B. Fischer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36454-36461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate the contribution of Duox1 NADPH oxidase activation in ATP-mediated H2O2 production, we used the pharmacological NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or silenced Duox1 expression in HBE1 cells using siRNA. Transfection of HBE1 cells with Duox1 siRNA was found to suppress Duox1 expression by 60-70% without significantly affecting Duox2 expression (Fig. 3A) and resulted in markedly decreased Duox immunoreactivity (Fig. 3B). Both basal and ATP-stimulated H2O2 production by HBE1 cells was markedly reduced by DPI and after transfection with Duox1 siRNA (Fig. 3C), indicating that Duox1 is primarily responsible for epithelial H2O2 production. The extent of inhibition of H2O2 production by Duox1 siRNA was 50-70%, equivalent to the relative extent by which Duox1 expression was suppressed (Fig. 3A). In addition, DPI and Duox1 siRNA also markedly reduced localized H2O2 production after epithelial wounding, as measured by DCF fluorescence (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that epithelial injury results in localized ATP-mediated production of H2O2 due to the activation of Duox1.FIGURE 3Duox1 is primarily responsible for ATP-mediated H2O2 production in bronchial epithelial cells. A, analysis of Duox expression in NHBE and HBE1 cells and silencing of Duox1 expression in HBE1 cells by siRNA. HBE1 cells were transfected with Duox1-targeted siRNA (Ambion catalog number 16708) or control siRNA (Ambion catalog number 4611) for 72 h, and Duox1 and Duox2 mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and expressed quantitatively relative to GAPDH expression (mean ± S.E.; n = 3; *, p < 0.05 compared with control). B, immunohistochemical analysis of Duox protein in untreated HBE1 cells or cells transfected with either control or Duox1 siRNA using a polyclonal antibody against Duox1 (kindly provided by Dr. J. David Lambeth; used at 1:50 dilution for 45 min). C, HBE1 cells were preincubated with DPI (1 μm) for 15 min or transfected with Duox1-targeted siRNA 48 h prior to cell stimulation with 100 μm ATP in the presence of Tyr and lactoper-oxidase, and H2O2 production was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (mean ± S.E.; n = 3-4; *, p < 0.05 compared with corresponding control). D, fluorescence analysis of cellular H2O2 production by HBE1 cells transfected for 72 h with either control siRNA (a and b) or Duox1 siRNA (c and d) and preloaded with the oxidant-sensitive probe H2DCF-DA (Molecular Probes; 10 μm for 30 min) after linear scratch injury. Alternatively, HBE1 cells were preincubated with DPI (10 μm) (e and f) 30 min prior to wounding. DCF fluorescence was monitored 30 min after linear scratch injury, and representative results of two separate experiments are shown in comparison with corresponding bright field images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Duox1 Activation Contributes to Airway Epithelial Cell Migration and Repair—Based on the observed stimulatory effects of ATP on epithelial cell migration and wound repair, the localized ATP-mediated activation of Duox1 at the wound margin of injury in the epithelial monolayers, and the suggested involvement of NADPH oxidases in cell migration in other cell types (22Moldovan L.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase converts epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to their corresponding diols, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, modifying or eliminating the function of these oxylipins. To better understand the phenotypic impact of Ephx2 disruption, two independently derived colonies of soluble epoxide hydrolase-null mice were compared. We examined this genotype evaluating protein expression, biofluid oxylipin profile, tissue oxylipin production capacity, and blood pressure. Ephx2 gene disruption eliminated soluble epoxide hydrolase protein expression and activity in liver, kidney, and heart from each colony. Plasma levels of epoxy fatty acids were increased, and fatty acid diols levels were decreased, while measured levels of lipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-dependent oxylipins were unchanged. Liver and kidney homogenates also show elevated epoxide fatty acids. However, in whole kidney homogenate a 4-fold increase in the formation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was measured along with a 3-fold increase in lipoxygenase-derived hydroxylation and prostanoid production. Unlike previous reports, however, neither Ephx2-null colony showed alterations in basal blood pressure. Finally, the soluble epoxide hydrolase-null mice show a survival advantage following acute systemic inflammation. The data suggest that blood pressure homeostasis may be achieved by increasing production of the vasoconstrictor, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the kidney of the Ephx2-null mice. This shift in renal metabolism is likely a metabolic compensation for the loss of the soluble epoxide hydrolase gene.

French R.A. Thibodeau M.S. Grant D.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). sEH catalyzes the degradation of endogenous epoxy lipids such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) to their less active diols (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, DHETs) and hence plays a critical role in the control of EET levels (2Spector A.A. Fang X. Snyder G.D. Weintraub N.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These epoxy lipids are potent vasodilators, regulating cerebral and renal homodynamic and blood pressure (3Imig J.D. Navar L.G. Roman R.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. J. Am. Soc.

Zeldin D.C. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).The human Ephx2 gene encodes sEH and consists of 19 exons encoding 555 amino acids (12Sandberg M. Meijer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There is 73% homology between the human and mouse sEH protein sequences (13Beetham J.K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Each monomer of the homodimeric mouse sEH has two distinct domains (14Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4716-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain exhibits phosphatase activity, and the C-terminal domain is responsible for the epoxide hydrolase activities (16Cronin A. Mowbray S. Durk H. Homburg S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B.

Whereas the endogenous role of the phosphatase domain has yet to be elucidated, lipophilic phosphates appear to be excellent substrates (17Newman J.W. Morisseau C. Harris T.R. Hammock B.D. Proc.

Zeldin D.C. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The CYP-derived eicosanoids are synthesized throughout the body but act in a paracrine and autocrine fashion to regulate cellular function. In particular, the kidney and vascular endothelium produce significant levels of CYP-derived eicosanoids with effects on renal tubular transport function and vascular reactivity. Altered levels of renal EETs and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are associated with changes in blood pressure (20Su P. Kaushal K.M. Kroetz D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R426-R438PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yu Z. Xu F. Huse L.M. Morisseau C. Draper A.J. Newman J.W. Parker C. Graham L. Engler M.M. Hammock B.D. Zeldin D.C. Kroetz D.L. Circ.

Furthermore, CYP epoxygenase activity is increased in animal models of hypertension, including the spontaneously hypertensive rats (21Yu Z. Xu F. Huse L.M. Morisseau C. Draper A.J. Newman J.W. Parker C. Graham L. Engler M.M. Hammock B.D. Zeldin D.C. Kroetz D.L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and a high salt diet (23Makita K. Takahashi K. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The elevation in EET biosynthesis in these models could be a consequence of elevated blood pressure and might represent a compensatory response of the animal to deleterious increases in blood pressure. Moreover, inhibition of epoxygenases by clotrimazole leads to salt-dependent hypertension (24Holla V.R. Makita K. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and an inability to increase P450 epoxygenase activity with excess dietary salt intake in Dahl salt-sensitive rats might contribute to the hypertensive phenotype of these animals (23Makita K. Takahashi K. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, with the onset of obesity-related hypertension the renal expression of CYP epoxygenases declines, while CYP omega hydroxylase and cyclooxygenase 2 expression increase (25Dey A. Williams R.S. Pollock D.M. Stepp D.W. Newman J.W. Hammock B.D. Imig J.D. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Wang M.H. Smith A. Zhou Y. Chang H.H. Lin S. Zhao X. Imig J.D. Dorrance A.M. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would appear that the interplay of epoxygenase, ω-hydroxylases, and cyclooxygenase in the kidney are important determinants of blood pressure control.To expand on the phenotypic characterization of the Ephx2-null mouse, animals were obtained from two independently derived and housed colonies of mice. The two colonies were either derived at the National Institutes of Health (10Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M. Nagata K. Bend J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40504-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), or by Lexicon Genetics Inc. (The Woodlands, Texas). The latter, was exclusively for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Ridgefield, CT). Previous studies have shown that attenuation of endogenous EETs hydrolysis via sEH inhibition is a potentially useful pharmacological strategy for blood pressure regulation (4Imig J.D. Zhao X. Capdevila J.H. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 9Smith K.R. Pinkerton K.E. Watanabe T. Pedersen T.L. Ma S.J. Hammock B.D. Proc.

In this regard, our main goal for this study was to perform a broad profile of the Ephx2-null phenotype and subsequently to evaluate blood pressure regulation under resting state as well as stressed conditions. We hypothesized that elevated endogenous EETs would have an advantageous role in blood pressure homeostasis and protect the overall health of the animal under abnormal conditions in which blood pressure is compromised.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Genotypic Analysis—Mice on a 129X1/SvJ × C57BL/6 background with targeted disruption in the Ephx2 gene were obtained from Chris Sinal, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada under a National Cancer Institute Material Transfer Agreement 1-16268-04 (10Sinal C.J.

These mice backcrossed onto a C57BL6 genetic background three generations prior to use in this study. This colony is referred as the NIH colony, and was used to rederive a new colony by embryo transfer. Routine genotyping of sEH-null mice was performed as published (10Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M.

Primer F1/R2 predicts a 290-base pair product for the wild type allele (Fig. 1A). For the null allele, primers F1/R3 predict a 560-base pair product of a neomycin resistance sequence as described previously (Fig. 1A and Ref. 10Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M. Nagata K. Bend J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40504-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).A second colony of sEH-null mice was independently derived for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The heterozygous Ephx2 founder mice were created at Lexicon Genetics Inc. by gene trapping using random insertional mutagenesis with retroviral vector VICTR48 as described by Zambrowicz et al. (28Zambrowicz B.P. Friedrich G.A. Buxton E.C. Lilleberg S.L. Person C. Sands A.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The integration site of the targeting cassette is in intron two. The heterozygous Ephx2 mice were then mated to establish a colony in the C57BL/6 albino × 129Sv/Ev mixed genetic background. Once obtained, Ephx2-null homozygotes were paired for subsequent breeding. Mice were maintained on sterile normal rodent diet (PicoLab rodent 20 from LabDiet, Richmond, IN) and bottled water ad libitum. Mice at age of 12–20 weeks were used and matched wild type mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. These animals were housed and bred in the Department of Cardiovascular Disease at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and are referred to as the BI colony.BI Colony Blood Pressure—All procedures were conducted in accordance with approved IACUC protocols. Mean blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored continuously in conscious, unrestrained female (20 weeks old) and male (12–20 weeks old) wild type and sEH-null mice using DSI telemetry (St. Paul, MN). Mice were surgically implanted with DSI TA11PA-20 telemetry transmitters and allowed to recover for a minimum of 7 days prior to study. Following recovery, mice were singly housed in plastic boxes placed directly on top of the telemetry receiver. Mean BP and HR data were recorded for 60 s every 20 min for the duration of the monitoring period. Individual mean BP and HR data were averaged over a 12-h cycle.NIH Colony Blood Pressure and LPS Challenge—All procedures were conducted in accordance with approved IACUC protocols. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HR were measured in conscious, restrained wild type and Ephx2-null mice, starting at 8 weeks of age. Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail cuff plethysmography using a BP-2000 blood pressure analysis system (Visitech Systems, Apex, NC). Mice (n = 4 per genotype) were trained for 6 days to become acclimated to the Visitech System. For SBP and HR, twenty measurements were recorded daily and the last ten measurements averaged for a given mouse.Western Blot Analysis—The expression of sEH or CYP4A proteins were analyzed by homogenization of tissues as described earlier (29Newman J.W.

Briefly, protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Protein aliquots from each tissue were resolved on 10–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies against human sEH ((30Du Teaux S.B.

Chemiluminescent detection using ECL reagent from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ) was carried out on x-ray film.sEH Activity Assay—Soluble epoxide hydrolase activity was performed as previously described (29Newman J.W. Stok J.E. Vidal J.D. Corbin C.J. Huang Q. Hammock B.D. Conley A.J. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates were diluted with sodium phosphate (100 mm, pH 7.4; 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and chilled (on ice) until assayed. Assays were initiated by adding 1 μl of 5 mm [2-3H]-trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide (3H-tDPPO; [S]final = 50 μm) in N,N′-dimethyl-formamide to 100 μl of tissue homogenate. Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Reactions were quenched with 60 μl of methanol and 200 μl of isooctane (31Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Controls for interfering glutathione-transferase activity were prepared as described previously, but were quenched with 60 μl of methanol and 200 μl of hexanol (31Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A 40-μl aliquot of the aqueous phase was analyzed for the presence of the radioactive diol product by liquid scintillation counting. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Results are means ± S.D. of three separate experiments.Sample Collection and Oxylipin Extraction—Blood was collected from phenobarbital-anesthetized mice by cardiac puncture in EDTA-rinsed syringes. Each sample was immediately spun (10 min, 400 × g), and the plasma was separated and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Urine was collected from male Ephx2-null or wild type mice (n = 3) housed 24 h in metabolic chambers. Food and water were provided ad lib. Urine was collected into dry ice-chilled tubes containing butylated hydroxytoluene and EDTA at 0.2 mg and 10 mg of triphenylphosphine. Samples were stored at –80 °C until analysis. Oxylipins were extracted by solid phase extraction. Detailed protocols are provided as Supplemental Data under “Oxylipin extraction” (32Newman J.W. Watanabe T. Hammock B.D. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1563-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Oxylipin Production Assay—Polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidase activities were determined in S9 fractions using modifications of previously reported procedures (29Newman J.W. Stok J.E. Vidal J.D. Corbin C.J. Huang Q. Hammock B.D. Conley A.J. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fatty acid epoxygenase, ω-hydroxylase, mid-chain hydroxylase, and prostaglandin synthase activities were obtained simultaneously. Briefly, aliquots (2 mg of protein) were suspended in 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated (30 °C, 30 min) with or without arachidonic acid (100 μm) in the presence of an NADPH regenerating system. Reactions were halted with methanol containing analytical surrogates, and samples were centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. Arachidonate oxidation products were quantified in the isolated supernatant by HPLC/MS/MS. In the absence of arachidonic acid, no oxidation products were detected. Each reaction was performed in duplicate and mean specific activities were expressed in fmol/min/mg protein.Oxylipin Analysis—Epoxides, diols, alcohols, and ketones of linoleate and arachidonate were quantified in all samples. Thromboxanes and prostaglandins were also measured in plasma and tissue production assays, but not urine because of matrix-dependent ion suppression. These oxylipins were quantified by HPLC/MS/MS using internal standard methods (32Newman J.W. Watanabe T. Hammock B.D. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1563-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Detailed protocols including HPLC (supplemental Table S1) and mass spectroscopy (supplemental Table S2) parameters are provided as Supplemental Data. Plasma and urine epoxide and diol surrogate recoveries were acceptable in all samples (see supplemental Table S3). Recoveries of tetradeuterated 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α (d4–6-keto-PGF1 α) were acceptable in plasma (see supplemental Table S3) and used to quantify 6-keto-PGF1α. Epoxide surrogate hydrolysis was less than 3% for all assays. Reagent blanks showed background levels below detection limit, and analytical replicates showed precision to be within 15% for greater than 80% of the analytes present at levels greater than ten times the method detection limits.Statistics—Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. or S.E., as indicated. Data were analyzed by Student's t test or ANOVA, as indicated under the figure legends. Values were considered significantly different if p < 0.05.RESULTSsEH Gene, Protein Expression, and Activity—The sEH gene was not detected in either colony of Ephx2-null mice (Fig. 1A). Data are shown for the NIH colony. Identical results were obtained with the BI colony (data not shown). Evaluation of sEH protein expression was performed on tissues from representative animals from each colony. Polyclonal antibodies highly selective to sEH recognized a protein band of 62.5 kDa in liver, kidney, and heart of wild type sEH mice from the BI and NIH colonies (Fig. 1B), but not in Ephx2-null mice (Fig. 1B). sEH was also observed in the lungs, spleen, adipose, and testis (data not shown) as previously reported (1Enayetallah A.E. French R.A. Thibodeau M.S. Grant D.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The distribution of the sEH protein was in agreement with published data as previously summarized (33Newman J.W. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The results from the sEH tDPPO hydrolase activity assays are shown in Table 1. As expected based on the immunoblots, hydrolase activity was observed in wild type, but not in Ephx2-null tissues. Notably, the sEH activity measured in heart was significantly different between the Ephx2+/+ mice from the two colonies (Table 1). sEH activity was ten times higher in heart extract from the BI colony. However, the rank order activity in both colonies was the same.TABLE 1sEH specific activities in liver, kidney, and heart tissue homogenates from the wild-type and Ephx2-null miceGenotypeBI colonyNIH colonyEphx2+/+Ephx2-/-Ephx2+/+Ephx2-/-nmol diol produced × min-1 × mg protein-1nmol diol produced × min-1 × mg protein-1Liver32 ± 2<0.138 ± 5<0.01Kidney18 ± 3<0.116 ± 3<0.01Heart14 ± 2<0.11.4 ± 0.2<0.04 Open table in a new tab Blood Pressure—The initial description of the Ephx2-null mouse indicated a male-specific hypotensive phenotype (10Sinal C.J.

To assess the maintenance of this phenotype in the two new colonies, blood pressure and heart rate measurements were performed in NIH colony by tail cuff and in the BI colony by telemetry. In the BI colony, no physiologically relevant differences in mean blood pressure were noted between genotypes (Fig. 2A). There was a significant difference in mean blood pressure noted between female and male Ephx2-null mice but only on the first day of the 6-day monitoring period. Female wild type mice exhibited a trend toward higher overall heart rate levels compared with male wild type and Ephx2-null mice (Fig. 2A). These results are inconsistent with data published previously (10Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M. Nagata K. Bend J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40504-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To further investigate a potential strain difference, blood pressure was also assessed for 10 days in male Ephx2-null mice from the NIH-derived UC Davis colony compared with wild type. The NIH colony also failed to reveal a consistent difference in systolic blood pressure measurements between Ephx2-null and wild type mice (Fig. 2B). Several transient differences were measured on day 4 and 6, but were variable and not sustained. Therefore, no appreciable differences in resting blood pressure were detected between wild type and Ephx2-null genotypes from either of the two independently derived colonies.FIGURE 2Elimination of sEH protein expression fails to cause detectable alteration in blood pressure. A, mean blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded via telemetry (12-h averages) in wild type and Ephx2-null mice from the BI colony. B, mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HR were recorded by tail cuff measurements in the NIH colony. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. for: ♂ Ephx2+/+ (n = 9); ♂ Ephx2–/– (n = 11); ♀ Ephx2+/+ (n = 4) and ♀ Ephx2–/– (n = 5) in the BI colony and mean ± S.E. for: ♂ Ephx2+/+ (n = 4) and ♂ Ephx2–/– (n = 4) in the NIH colony. Significant differences are indicated by ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer for telemetry and single factor ANOVA for tail cuff plethysmography (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plasma Oxylipins—Plasma CYP- and sEH-dependent oxylipin profiles from wild type and Ephx2-null animals from each colony are shown in Table 2 and described graphically in supplemental Fig. S1A. Compared with their wild type counterparts, both the BI and NIH colony Ephx2-null mice showed elevated plasma levels of linoleate epoxides (EpOMEs) and 14(15)-EET. Levels of the linoleate diol 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecaenoic acid (12,13-DHOME) were reduced in these mice. Significant reductions in the 14,15-DHET were also observed in the BI colony Ephx2-null mice. Fig. 3 displays enzymatic substrate to product ratios of plasma oxylipins for wild type and Ephx2-null mice from the BI colony (see Ref. 34Seubert J.M. Sinal C.J. Graves J. Degraff L.M. Bradbury J.A.

Res. 2006; 99: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar for NIH-derived colony results). Whereas the CYP-epoxygenase/sEH-dependent epoxidediol ratios were altered by Ephx2 disruption, the sEH-independent, 9-HODE to 9-oxo-ODE ratio was unaffected in the Ephx2-null mice. In addition, the magnitude of the difference between the sEH-dependent substrate to product ratios was correlated with the distance of the oxidized center from the carboxyl carbon (n = 6, r > 0.81, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, inset). This trend mimics the substrate selectivity of the soluble epoxide hydrolase, which preferentially hydrolyzes epoxy fatty acids with epoxides positioned far from the carboxyl carbon as summarized in Newman et al. (33Newman J.W. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Changes observed in plasma levels of the measured lipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-dependent metabolites were less than 2-fold. The CYP4A met"

In particular, ephrin-A ligand stimulation of tumor cells induces EphA2 receptor internalization and degradation, a process that has been explored as a means to reduce tumor malignancy. However, the mechanism and regulation of ligand-induced Eph receptor internalization are not well understood. Here we show that SHIP2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase 2) is recruited to activated EphA2 via a heterotypic sterile α motif (SAM)-SAM domain interaction, leading to regulation of EphA2 internalization. Overexpression of SHIP2 inhibits EphA2 receptor endocytosis, whereas suppression of SHIP2 expression by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing promotes ligand-induced EphA2 internalization and degradation. SHIP2 regulates EphA2 endocytosis via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent Rac1 activation. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels are significantly elevated in SHIP2 knockdown cells, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor decreases phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels and suppresses increased EphA2 endocytosis. Ephrin-A1 stimulation activates Rac1 GTPase, and the Rac1-GTP levels are further increased in SHIP2 knockdown cells. A dominant negative Rac1 GTPase effectively inhibited ephrin-A1-induced EphA2 endocytosis. Together, our findings provide evidence that recruitment of SHIP2 to EphA2 attenuates a positive signal to receptor endocytosis mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Rac1 GTPase.

The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) and their ligands, the ephrins, regulate a diverse array of biological responses in development and disease (reviewed in Refs. 1Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 2Brantley-Sieders D. Schmidt S. Parker M. Chen J. Curr. Pharm.

Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). These receptors represent the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases in the genome, consisting of at least 16 receptors that interact with nine membrane-bound ephrin ligands (reviewed in Refs. 1Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar and 2Brantley-Sieders D. Schmidt S. Parker M. Chen J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 3431-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). They can be further divided into two groups, class A and class B, based on sequence homology and binding affinity (5Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Class A Eph receptors interact with multiple ligands of the ephrin-A family, a group of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane proteins, whereas class B Eph receptors bind to ephrin-B ligands, a family of transmembrane proteins. Binding of Eph receptors to their ligands induces receptor clustering, receptor transphosphorylation, and activation of kinase activity, followed by activation of signaling cascades that mediate multiple cellular responses (reviewed in Refs. 1Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar and 4Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Major advances have been made in recent years to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which Ephs/ephrins regulate biological processes. In particular, ligand-induced receptor endocytosis has been studied in a number of biological systems. Upon juxtacrine interaction of cell surface ephrin-B ligand and EphB receptor, ligand-receptor complexes are internalized bidirectionally (6Zimmer M. Palmer A. Kohler J. Klein R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Marston D.J. Dickinson S. Nobes C.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Parker M. Roberts R. Enriquez M. Zhao X. Takahashi T. Pat Cerretti D. Daniel T. Chen J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This bidirectional endocytosis of ephrin-B and EphB complexes appears to be sufficient to promote cell detachment in axon withdrawal during growth cone collapse (6Zimmer M. Palmer A. Kohler J. Klein R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Marston D.J. Dickinson S. Nobes C.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of EphA receptor also appears to be critical in converting an initial adhesive interaction into a repulsive event in growth cone collapse response (9Cowan C.W. Shao Y.R. Sahin M. Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Greer P.L. Gao S. Griffith E.C. Brugge J.S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2005; 46: 205-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Outside of the nervous system, ligand-induced phosphorylation of the Eph receptors in tumor cells has been shown to result in receptor endocytosis and down-regulation of surface receptors (10Walker-Daniels J. Riese D.J. Kinch M.S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2002; 1: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Ota S. Kataoka H. Kanamori M. Li Z. Band H. Tanaka M. Sugimura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Enhanced EphA2 endocytosis and subsequent degradation are associated with decreased malignant cell behavior. Activating EphA2 monoclonal antibodies (12Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2840-2847PubMed Google Scholar), ephrin-mimetic peptides (13Koolpe M. Dail M.

Shukla S. Knapp D.W. Mohammed S. Kinch M.S. Mittal S. Cancer Gene Ther. 2004; : 1-10PubMed Google Scholar) have been developed to induce receptor endocytosis as a means to reduce EphA2 activity. Despite the important roles that Eph receptor endocytosis plays in biological responses, relatively little is known about how this pathway is regulated. We have previously shown that activation of the EphA2 receptor regulates Rac1 GTPase activity through a PI 2The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; SH2, Src 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; SAM, sterile α motif; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; SH2, Src 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; SAM, sterile α motif; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 3-kinase-dependent pathway (15Brantley-Sieders D. Caughron J. Hicks D. Pozzi A. Ruiz J.C. Chen J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified two proteins that interact with the activated EphA2 receptor and are capable of regulating the level of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3): the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and SHIP2 (SH2-containing phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase 2). SHIP2 belongs to the SHIP family of lipid phosphatases that dephosphorylates PIP3 produced by PI 3-kinase (16Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). PIP3 has been shown to interact with pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins, such as the Ras and Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factors, leading to the membrane recruitment and activation of these proteins (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Although expression of SHIP1 is restricted to the hematopoietic cell lineage, SHIP2 is expressed in many cell types (18Schurmans S. Carrio R. Behrends J. Pouillon V. Merino J. Clement S. Genomics. 1999; 62: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data suggest that SHIP2, together with PI 3-kinase, may function downstream of the EphA2 receptor to regulate Rho family GTPases. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate ephrin-Eph endocytosis. We show that ligand stimulation induces EphA2 receptor internalization in MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells. In response to ephrin binding to EphA2, SHIP2 is recruited to the sterile α motif (SAM) domain of EphA2. Overexpression of SHIP2 inhibited ligand-induced receptor endocytosis. Conversely, suppression of SHIP2 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing increased EphA2 endocytosis and subsequent degradation. The mechanism of regulation of EphA2 endocytosis by SHIP2 involves down-regulation of cellular PIP3 levels and inhibition of Rac1 GTPase activity. These findings suggest that SHIP2 plays a central role in regulation of EphA2 receptor endocytosis. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The mouse EphA2 cytoplasmic domain was cloned into pBridge-LexA (BD Biosciences) (pSGS2) as a bait to screen a human placenta library consisting of 3.5 × 106 independent clones (Clontech) as described (19Hunter S.G. Zhuang G. Brantley-Sieders D.M. Swatt W. Cowan C.W. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4830-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strain L40 (MATa his3D200 trp1–901 leu2–3112 ade2 LYS2::(4lexAop-HIS3) URA3::(8lexAop-lacZ) GAL4) was transformed with pSGS2 and the placenta cDNA library. The resulting transformants were screened for histidine prototrophy and expression of LacZ. The His+/LacZ+ clones that did not interact with lamin C were subjected to PCR analyses to eliminate duplicate clones. Among 14 unique His+/LacZ+ clones, six overlapping clones encompassing the SAM domain of the SHIP2 gene were identified. Antibodies—Antibodies used for immunoblot or immunocytochemistry include anti-Myc (1:500; BD Biosciences), anti-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma), anti-EphA2 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine (1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), anti-Rac1 and anti-Cdc42 antibodies (1:250; Pharmingen), anti-PIP3 (1:250; Echelon), and anti-EEA1 (1:1000; BD Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, 1.5 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-SHIP2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Anti-SHIP2 polyclonal chick antibodies were made by Zymed Laboratories Inc., using the purified GST-SAM domain of the SHIP2 protein as antigen, and used in Western blot analysis. In Vitro Binding Assay—MBP-EphA2-SAM, the fusion of the intracellular portion of mouse EphA2 SAM domain and maltose-binding protein, was created from pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs) and purified on amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Escherichia coli lysate containing GST-SHIP2-SAM domains was incubated with amylose-bound MBP-EphA2-SAM or control MBP alone. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted and subjected to Western blot analyses using anti-EphA2 and anti-SHIP2 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—COS7 cells were co-transfected with 1 μg each of FLAG-tagged SHIP2 and EphA2 or Myc-tagged EphA2 mutants using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus 50 mm protease inhibitors). Anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used to immunoprecipitate SHIP2. The resulting proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot using anti-EphA2. 1.5 μg of anti-EphA2 antibody (sc-924; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also used in immunoprecipitation, and precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis by SHIP2 antibodies. For coimmunoprecipitation between SHIP2 and EphA2ΔSAM or SAM domain alone, Myc-agarose (Sigma) was used to immunoprecipitate EphA2 mutants. siRNA-mediated Silencing of SHIP2 in MDA-MB-231 Cells— SHIP2 knockdown was achieved by siRNA-mediated stable silencing of SHIP2 via retroviral transduction, as described (20Brantley-Sieders D. Fang W.B. Hwang Y. Hicks D. Chen J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10315-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, human SHIP2 siRNAs and control siRNA were designed using Invitrogen software according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 64-base pair oligonucleotide linker containing SHIP2-specific sense and corresponding antisense sequences, flanking a 6-base hairpin, was generated, PAGE-purified, and subcloned into retroviral vector pRS (a gift of R. Agami, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). pRS SHIP2 siRNA or control siRNA retrovirus were produced in the Phoenix cell packaging line. For siRNA expression, MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with pRS SHIP2 or control siRNA retroviruses and selected in the presence of 5 μg/ml puromycin. Pooled clones of MDA-MB-231, number 1, 2, 3, and 4, or single clone 2A expressing either SHIP2 or control siRNAs were analyzed. The level of SHIP2 knockdown in pooled clones was assessed by quantifying band intensity of SHIP2 over tubulin using Scion Image software. Confocal Microscopy Analysis—Control or SHIP2 knockdown cells were plated on coverslips in 6-well dishes and cultured to 50% confluence. Growth medium was replaced with 1 ml of starvation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% bovine serum albumin or Opti-MEM) per well. For immunofluorescence assays, cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml ephrin-A1 for 30 min and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Following fixation, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-EphA2, 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); monoclonal anti-EEA1, 1:1000 (BD Biosciences); monoclonal anti-Myc, 1:1000 (Cell Signaling); monoclonal anti-FLAG, 1:1000 (Sigma)) for 2 h at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C, followed by secondary antibodies (Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:3000) or Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:3000) from Molecular Probes). Images were recorded by confocal microscopy. Internalization was quantified by drawing an area under the cell membrane (within the cell but excluding cell membrane) of each cell on the confocal image, and pixels of internalized vesicles within the area were counted. Pixel density is calculated as total pixels per cell within the circled area using Metamorph computer software. Experiments were repeated three times, and 20–40 cells/experiment were analyzed. Data are presented as mean ± S.D., and statistical significance was assessed by a two-tailed, paired Student's t test. Biotinylation Assay for Endocytosis—MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by washing to quench free biotin. Cells were then incubated in normal medium at 37 °C for the indicated times in the presence of ephrin-A1-Fc or control IgG. Biotinylated cell surface proteins were removed by 0.01% trypsinization. Remaining biotinylated proteins were sequestered inside cells by endocytosis and were protected from trypsinization. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin beads, and biotinylated EphA2 proteins were visualized by anti-EphA2 coupled chemiluminescence detection using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). PIP3 ELISA—Confluent cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with ephrin-A1-Fc or control IgG for 10 min. PIP3 was extracted from cells and subjected to ELISA assay using a PIP3 mass ELISA kit (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT). Briefly, lipids were extracted with 2.25 ml of MeOH, CHCl3,12 m HCl (80:40:1) for 15 min at room temperature and partitioned by centrifugation after the addition of 0.75 ml of CHCl3 and 1.35 ml of 0.1 m HCl. The lower phase was vacuum-dried and dissolved in PIP3 buffer. Controls, standards and samples were incubated with PIP3 detector, secondary detection reagent, and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution sequentially. The reaction was terminated by adding stop solution (0.5 m H2SO4), and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Experiments were repeated twice, and all controls, standards, and samples were run in triplicate per experiment. Data are presented as mean ± S.D., and statistical significance was assessed by two-tailed, paired Student's t test. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—For Rac1 and Cdc42 activation assays, cells were serum-starved for 24 h in 1% fetal bovine serum followed by stimulation with ephrin-A1 (1 μg/ml). Lysates were prepared and incubated with Pak-1 binding domain-GST beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer's protocol to pull down GTP-bound Rac1 and/or Cdc42. Activated Rac1 and Cdc42 (or total Rac1 and Cdc42 in lysates) were detected by immunoblot using anti-Rac1 or anti-Cdc42 antibodies. Active Rac1-GTP or Cdc42-GTP levels were quantified by densitometry (Rac1-GTP/total Rac1) using Scion Image software. Experiments were repeated three times, and data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by a two-tailed, paired Student's t test. Activated EphA2 Receptor Interacts with SHIP2—A yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify EphA2 receptor-interacting proteins (19Hunter S.G. Zhuang G. Brantley-Sieders D.M. Swatt W. Cowan C.W. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4830-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The bait construct consisted of the intracellular portion of mouse EphA2 fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA. Upon screening a cDNA library from human placenta, we obtained six independent but overlapping interacting clones that contained the SAM domain of SHIP2. Interestingly, the binding of SHIP2 to the EphA2 receptor is quite specific, since it binds to neither EphB1 receptor nor other EphA receptors (data not shown). The observation that the SHIP2 SAM domain interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of EphA2 in yeast raised the possibility that SHIP2 and EphA2 interact in mammalian cells. To test this hypothesis, we transfected COS7 cells with a FLAG-tagged full-length SHIP2 expression construct and immunoprecipitated cell lysates with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, the EphA2 was readily detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates. The co-immunoprecipitation of EphA2 with the anti-FLAG antibody was dependent on the expression of SHIP2 and ephrin-A1 stimulation, since EphA2 was undetectable in the unstimulated samples and in immunoprecipitates in which a control vector was expressed. In the reverse direction, SHIP2 was easily detected in anti-EphA2 immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with SHIP2 and stimulated with ephrin-A1 (Fig. 1B). However, SHIP2 does not bind to EphA3 or EphA4 (Fig. 1E), demonstrating the binding specificity of SHIP2 to EphA2. To determine whether endogenous EphA2 receptor can bind to SHIP2, MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with ephrin-A1, and cell lysates were subjected to a GST-SHIP2-SAM pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, GST-SHIP2, but not control GST, binds to endogenously expressed EphA2 in response to ephrin-A1 ligand stimulation. In addition, EphA2 was detected in anti-SHIP2 immunoprecipitates upon ephrin-A1 stimulation in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that SHIP2 is recruited to activated EphA2 receptors in breast cancer cells. Mapping of Interaction Domains between EphA2 and SHIP2— To identify the domains within the EphA2 receptor that mediate the interaction with SHIP2, a panel of EphA2 constructs was generated in which portions of EphA2 were deleted. The resulting EphA2 mutants were expressed at comparable levels in the yeast two-hybrid assay and tested for their interaction with SHIP2 (Fig. 2A). EphA2 receptors lacking the juxtamembrane domain, kinase domain, or PDZ binding motif were capable of binding with SHIP2 as efficiently as the wild-type receptor. The interaction between the two proteins is disrupted in EphA2 mutants with a deletion of the SAM domain. The EphA2 SAM domain alone binds to SHIP2 as well as the wild-type receptor, indicating that the SAM-SAM interaction is required for binding to SHIP2. The original six independent and overlapping yeast two-hybrid interacting clones of SHIP2 all contained the SAM domain. As shown in Fig. 2B, the SAM domain of SHIP2 alone can bind to the EphA2 cytoplasmic domain, whereas the SHIP2 SH2 domain fails to bind to EphA2. The heterotypic interaction between the EphA2 SAM and the SHIP2 SAM domains was verified in mammalian cells. As predicted from the yeast two-hybrid assay, binding of EphA2 to SHIP2 is independent of EphA2 receptor phosphorylation, since a kinase-dead (D738N) mutant or three Tyr to Phe mutations (Y921F, Y929F, and Y959F) in the EphA2 SAM domain did not affect binding significantly (Fig. 2C); nor did the deletion of the SH2 domain in SHIP2 protein (Fig. 2E). In contrast, deletion of the EphA2 SAM domain abolished the ability to bind to SHIP2, whereas the EphA2 SAM domain alone was capable of interacting with SHIP2 (Fig. 2D). Conversely, deletion of the SHIP2 SAM domain also inhibited binding to the EphA2 receptor (Fig. 2E), confirming the heterotypic interaction between the two SAM domains. To test for a direct interaction between EphA2 and SHIP2, the SAM domains of SHIP2 and EphA2 were expressed as GST and MBP fusion proteins, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2F, GST-SHIP2-SAM bound to MBP-EphA2-SAM that was linked to amylose beads. After extensive washing, only GST-SHIP2-SAM and MBP-EphA2-SAM were eluted from the column. Although GST-SHIP2-SAM bound to MBP-EphA2-SAM, it failed to interact with MBP alone, indicating that the binding is specific to the EphA2-SAM in vitro and independent of phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that the EphA2 receptor binds to the SHIP2 phosphatase through a SAM-SAM heterotypic interaction. Overexpression of SHIP2 Inhibits Ligand-induced EphA2 Receptor Endocytosis—As a first step to determine the functional link between SHIP2 and EphA2 endocytosis, we analyzed the kinetics of ligand-induced EphA2 receptor internalization in MDA-MB-231 cells by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, upon stimulation with soluble ephrin-A1, EphA2 receptor (green) clusters rapidly and localizes in large patches, followed by internalization of the receptor. These internalized vesicles were costained with EEA1 (red), an early endosomal marker (21Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), suggesting that EphA2 receptor is internalized by endocytosis. Next, we over-expressed wild-type Myc-tagged SHIP2 in COS7 cells and examined ephrin-A1-induced receptor endocytosis. Anti-Myc antibodies detected cells expressing exogenous SHIP2 (red), whereas subcellular localization of the endogenous EphA2 receptor was detected by anti-EphA2 antibodies (green). Internalization of EphA2 receptor (green) was significantly inhibited in cells overexpressing SHIP2 (red) but not SHIP2ΔSAM (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that SHIP2 regulates ligand-induced EphA2 receptor endocytosis via its SAM domain. Although SHIP2 can function directly as a phosphoinositide phosphatase, it is interesting to note that it also contains multiple functional domains/motifs that may mediate the recruitment of other signaling molecules. To determine whether SHIP2 regulates EphA2 endocytosis via its phosphatase activity or acting as an adaptor protein, we transfected COS7 cells with a catalytic-inactive SHIP2 mutant, D607A (22Paternotte N. Zhang J. Vandenbroere I. Backers K. Blero D. Kioka N. Vanderwinden J.M. Pirson I. Erneux C. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6052-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Taylor V. Wong M. Brandts C. Reilly L. Dean N.M. Cowsert L.M. Moodie S. Stokoe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6860-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, the D607A mutant did not inhibit ephrin-A1-induced EphA2 receptor internalization, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of SHIP2 is required for regulation of EphA2 endocytosis. Enhanced EphA2 Receptor Endocytosis in SHIP2 Knockdown Cells—To understand the role of SHIP2 in EphA2 receptor endocytosis in breast cancer cells, we inhibited the endogenous SHIP2 expression by retrovirus-mediated siRNA knockdown. Four siRNA duplexes of sequence specific to SHIP2 were tested in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. These siRNAs were stably expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells by retroviral transduction. As shown in Fig. 4A, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing siRNA2 inhibited the expression of endogenous SHIP2 to greater than 80%. siRNAs 1, 3, and 4 also produced a target protein suppression but to a lesser degree (∼50%). A control siRNA with two mismatches in sequence 2 was completely inactive. To investigate whether ephrin-A1-induced EphA2 receptor endocytosis is affected by knockdown of SHIP2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, SHIP2 knockdown or control cells were treated with ephrin-A1, and EphA2 receptor localization was followed by confocal immunofluorescence analysis. As shown in Fig. 4B,in SHIP2 knockdown cells, ephrin-A1 stimulation enhanced the accumulation of internalized EphA2 vesicles, compared with parental MDA-MB-231 (data not shown) or control siRNA-expressing cells. Quantification of these vesicles revealed that there was an ∼2-fold increase in vesicle pixel density in SHIP2 knock down cells, compared with control siRNA-expressing cells, indicating that SHIP2 negatively regulates EphA2 endocytosis. Internalization of cell surface EphA2 was also tracked using a surface biotinylation assay described by Le et al. (24Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were surface-biotinylated at 4 °C and then returned to 37 °C following a time course to allow trafficking to resume. Cells were incubated briefly with a dilute trypsin solution to remove cell surface proteins. Internalized EphA2 was sequestered at 37 °C and therefore protected from trypsin digestion. Little if any EphA2 was detected in control cells (Fig. 4C, 0 min), confirming that under these conditions, biotinylated cell surface proteins were efficiently removed by trypsin. In contrast, after 10, 20, and 30 min at 37 °C, a biotinylated pool of EphA2 was detected in cells following trypsin treatment (Fig. 4C, 10, 20, and 30 min), indicating that EphA2 was internalized and protected from typsinization. Ephrin-A1 induced EphA2 internalization in both control and SHIP2 knockdown cells, but the level of internalized EphA2 was appreciably higher in SHIP2 knockdown cells compared with that in control cells (Fig. 4C). We also observed a basal level of EphA2 internalization in the absence of ligand stimulation (Fig. 4C, right). However, this level is significantly lower than that with ephrin-A1 stimulation. These data provide independent evidence that ephrin-A1 stimulation induces EphA2 internalization, and this process is regulated by SHIP2. To determine whether increased endocytic vesicles observed in SHIP2 knockdown cells affected ligand-induced receptor degradation, we performed Western blot analysis of EphA2 following ephrin-A1 treatment. The total level of EphA2 receptor decreased with increasing length of ephrin-A1 treatment, and this process was enhanced in SHIP2 knockdown cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that SHIP2 regulates EphA2 degradation. SHIP2 Regulates EphA2 Endocytosis through Modulation of Cellular PIP3 Levels—We next explored the mechanisms by which SHIP2 regulates EphA2 receptor endocytosis. As SHIP2 is a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase, we determi"

The addition of magnesium directs this molecule toward chlorophyll biosynthesis. The first step downstream from the branchpoint is catalyzed by the magnesium chelatase and is a highly regulated process. The corresponding product, magnesium protoporphyrin IX, has been proposed to play an important role as a signaling molecule implicated in plastid-to-nucleus communication. To get more information on the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and on magnesium protoporphyrin IX derivative functions, we have identified an magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM) knock-out mutant in Arabidopsis in which the mutation induces a blockage downstream from magnesium protoporphyrin IX and an accumulation of this chlorophyll biosynthesis intermediate. Our results demonstrate that the CHLM gene is essential for the formation of chlorophyll and subsequently for the formation of photosystems I and II and cytochrome b6f complexes. Analysis of gene expression in the chlm mutant provides an independent indication that magnesium protoporphyrin IX is a negative effector of nuclear photosynthetic gene expression, as previously reported. Moreover, it suggests the possible implication of magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester, the product of CHLM, in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. Finally, post-transcriptional up-regulation of the level of the CHLH subunit of the magnesium chelatase has been detected in the chlm mutant and most likely corresponds to specific accumulation of this protein inside plastids.

This result suggests that the CHLH subunit might play an important regulatory role when the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway is disrupted at this particular step. Chloroplast development depends on the coordinated synthesis of chlorophylls and cognate proteins and on their specific integration into photosynthetic complexes (for review, see Ref. 1Paulsen H. Aro E.M. Anderson B. in Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration: Regulation of Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 219-233Google Scholar). Chlorophylls are magnesium tetrapyrrole molecules resulting from condensation of ALA. 2The abbreviations used are: ALA, δ-aminolevulinic acid; MS, Murashige and Skoog; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; LHC, light-harvesting complex; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcription. Insertion of magnesium into protoporphyrin IX, the last common intermediate of hemes and chlorophylls, is catalyzed by magnesium chelatase, a membrane-interacting multisubunit enzyme containing 3 different soluble proteins: CHLH, CHLI, and CHLD (2Gibson L.C.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the next step, magnesium protoporphyrin IX is methylated by a membrane Ado-Met-dependent methyltransferase. In Arabidopsis the gene At4g25080 or CHLM has been identified as encoding the methyltransferase enzyme, and the product of this single gene has been reported to be present in the two chloroplast membrane systems; that is, the envelope and the thylakoids (6Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whereas a sequence homologous to CHLM has been identified in tobacco (7Alawady A. Reski R. Yaronskaya E. Grimm B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 57: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the existence in plants of an additional and quite dissimilar gene for magnesium protoporphyrin IX methylation has not been totally excluded. Expression analysis of tobacco CHLM revealed posttranslational activation of methyltransferase activity during greening and direct interaction of CHLM with the CHLH subunit of magnesium chelatase (7Alawady A. Reski R. Yaronskaya E. Grimm B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 57: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of tobacco plants expressing CHLM antisense or sense RNA led to the conclusion that methyltransferase activity is involved in the direct regulation of expression of some genes such as CHLH and LHCB (8Alawady A.E. Grimm B. Plant J. 2005; 41: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The meaning of the dual localization of the methyltransferase in the chloroplast envelope and the thylakoids is puzzling for different reasons. On one hand, chlorophylls are expected to be synthesized in the thylakoids where chlorophyll-binding proteins are inserted into photosystems. On the other hand, the envelope is devoid of chlorophyll but contains several chlorophyll precursors from protoporphyrin IX to protochlorophyllide (9Pineau B. Gerard-Hirne C. Douce R. Joyard J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition most of the enzymes of this part of the chlorophyll synthesis pathway, i.e. protoporphyrinogen oxidoreductase, magnesium chelatase, magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester cyclase, and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, are present in or interact with the envelope (10Matringe M.

Res. 2000; 64: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One reason for the occurrence of the chlorophyll intermediates in the envelope could be that some chlorophyll-binding proteins that are synthesized in the cytosol need to associate with chlorophyll or chlorophyll precursors during import through the envelope. Supporting this hypothesis, manipulation of Chlamydomonas in vivo systems, and mutagenesis of specific residues in the LHCB protein have shown that accumulation of physiological amounts of LHCB by plastids requires interaction of the protein with chlorophyll within the inner membrane of the envelope (14White R.A. Wolfe G.R. Komine Y. Hoober J.K. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Hoober J.K. Eggink L.L. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 197-215Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that chlorophyllide a oxygenase is involved in the regulated import and stabilization of the chlorophyllide b binding light-harvesting proteins LHCB1 (LHCII) and LHCB4 (CP29) in chloroplasts (16Reinbothe C. Bartsch S. Eggink L.L. Hoober J.K. Brusslan J. Andrade Paz R. Monnet J. Reinbothe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4777-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Beside their direct role in pigment synthesis, some chlorophyll intermediates have been proposed to play an additional role in intracellular signaling. In Chlamydomonas, magnesium protoporphyrin IX and magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester were shown to substitute for light in the induction of the nuclear gene HSP70 (17Kropat J. Oster U. Rudiger W. Beck C.F. Plant J. 2000; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, an increased accumulation of magnesium protoporphyrin IX has been reported in Norfluorazon-treated plants in which photooxidation of the plastid compartment leads to the repression of nuclear photosynthesis-related genes (18Mayfield S.P. Taylor W.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Strand A. Asami T. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Nature. 2003; 421: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a genetic screen based on the use of Norfluorazon has allowed the identification of a series of Arabidopsis gun (for genome-uncoupled) mutants that are deficient in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. Several of the corresponding mutations have been shown to affect genes coding for the protoporphyrin IX manipulating proteins CHLH, CHLD, and GUN4 (19Strand A. Asami T. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Nature. 2003; 421: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 20Mochizuki N. Brusslan J.A. Larkin R. Nagatani A. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In these mutants, Norfluorazon treatment induced only a moderate increase in magnesium protoporphyrin IX levels, correlated with partial derepression of transcription of the nuclear photosynthesis-related genes. This indicates a role of magnesium protoporphyrin IX accumulation in the repression of these genes (19Strand A. Asami T. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Nature. 2003; 421: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 22Susek R.E. Ausubel F.M. Chory J. Cell. 1993; 74: 787-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, this demonstration was based on manipulation of plants with Norflurazon that has obvious pleiotropic effects. Moreover, because of the possibility of substrate channeling occurring between magnesium chelatase and magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase, it was not possible to clearly distinguish the specific contributions of magnesium protoporphyrin IX and its methyl ester. Supporting the intricacy of the regulation, it has recently been shown that the barley xantha-l mutant, defective in the magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester cyclization step, has a non-gun phenotype in the presence of Norflurazon (23Rzeznicka K. Walker C.J. Westergren T. Kannangara C.G. Von Wettstein D. Merchant S. Gough S.P. Hansson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5886-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Gadjieva R. Axelsson E. Olsson U. Hansson M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the absence of Norflurazon, the mutant has a high level of LHCB gene expression despite the accumulation of magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester. In the present work, we identify a chlm null mutant and analyze the role of the methyltransferase enzyme in chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development. We also assess the ability of the mutant to carry out plastid-to-nucleus signaling. The results reveal a high level of repression of nuclear photosynthesis-related genes and a specific accumulation of the CHLH subunit of the magnesium chelatase. Functional implications of these results are discussed. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—The Arabidopsis thaliana chlm mutant (ABN42 line) of the ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) was obtained from the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Versailles, France. Plants were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS, Duchefa) agar containing 0.5% sucrose for 5 days under medium light (70 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) before transfer to dim light (5 μmol of photons m–2 s–1). Kanamycin selection of T-DNA containing seedlings was performed on medium supplemented with kanamycin (Sigma) at 50 mg liter–1. For Norflurazon treatment, seeds from CHLM/chlm heterozygous plants were germinated on standard MS-agar, and after 5 days of culture seedlings were transferred onto new plates including 5 μm Norflurazon and cultivated for 6 more days under strong light (100 μmol of photons m–2s–1). For complementation experiments, a pCambia derivative was obtained by cloning a EcoRI-HindIII fragment harboring the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-labeled promoter-GUS-NOST fusion from pBI221 (Clontech) in an EcoRI-HindIII-digested pCambia 1200 vector. The XbaI-EcoRI CHLM cDNA from the SK+ derivative obtained by Block et al. (6Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was then inserted into an SstI-XbaI-digested pCambia derivative using an EcoRI-SstI adaptor (5′-AATTAGCT-3′). The obtained binary vector was introduced into the GV3121 strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transform CHLM/chlm heterozygous plants. The transformed plants were PCR-screened to identify CHLM/chlm heterozygous plants and self-pollinated. The LHCII-LUC construct was introduced into the chlm mutant background by crossing a heterozygous CHLM/chlm plant with a homozygous CAB-LUC transgenic plant (25Millar A.J. Kay S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15491-15496Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The progeny was PCR-screened for the presence of chlm T-DNA, and seeds were collected from positive plants. The next generation segregates for both chlm T-DNA and the CAB-LUC transgene and was used for the experiment. The sequence encoding the putative CHLH transit peptide was amplified using TL350 (5′-GGATCCATGGCTTCGCTTGTGTATTCTCCATTC-3′) and TL352 (TCTAGAGACGATTTTCACCGTTCGGAAC-3′). The corresponding PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. The BamHI-XbaI fragment was then ligated in-frame with the XbaI-SacI EYFP gene (Clontech) into the BamHI-SacI sites of a binary vector derived from pCambia 1300 by introduction of a HindIII-EcoRI cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-labeled promoter and Nos-T terminator cassette from EL103 (26Mittler R. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1951-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The obtained binary vector was introduced into the GV3121 strain of A. tumefaciens to transform CHLM/chlm heterozygous plants. The transformed plants were PCR-screened to identify CHLM/chlm heterozygous plants and self-pollinated. PCR Analyses—Genomic DNA was amplified using the Tag6 primer (5′-CACTCAGTCTTTCATCTACGGCA-3′) and a specific primer (TL251 5′-GGAACAGCTTCGATGAGCCTAGAG-3′) to screen for the presence of chlm T-DNA insertion. The endogenous copy of the gene as well as the cDNA used for complementation were followed by PCR reactions using TL251 and TL252 (5′-GTGAGACTGATGAAGTGAATCG-3′). Standard PCR conditions were used. Pigment Analysis—Extraction was done according to Moran and Porath (27Moran R. Porath D.

The supernatant was collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and its absorbance in visible light was recorded. Tetrapyrole Intermediate Analysis—Approximately 20 mg of frozen leaf material was homogenized in 500 μl of acetone, 0.125 m NH4OH (9:1, v/v) in the dark and centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with 1 ml of grinding medium and extracted 3 times with 1 ml of hexane. After the complete elimination of the hexane phase, the acetone phase was either directly used for fluorescence measurement or dried under argon before solubilization in methanol, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate (70:30 v/v) for HPLC analysis. Florescence emission spectra were recorded with a spectrofluorometer MOS-450 from Biologic at room temperature from 570 to 690 nm upon excitation at either 402 nm for detection of protoporphyrin IX or 416 nm for detection of magnesium protoporphyrin IX and magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester or 440 nm for detection of chlorophyllide. HPLC analysis was as described in Block et al. (6Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) except that elution was monitored by absorbance detection at 420 nm and by fluorescence detection (λexcitation 420 nm/λemission 595 nm or λexcitation 420 nm/λemission 625 nm). Standards of protorporphyrin IX (Sigma), of magnesium protoporphyrin IX (Porphyrin Product Inc.), of magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester prepared and identified as described in Block et al. (6Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used. When required, plants were incubated overnight with 10 mm ALA and 5 mm magnesiumCl2 in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, before extraction. Protein Extraction and Immunoblot—Proteins were extracted from leaf material according to the method described by Hurkman and Tanaka (28Hurkman W.J. Tanaka C.K. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 802-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein analysis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (6Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilution: anti-CHLM 1/1000, anti-KARI 1/1000, anti-HSP70b 1/1000, anti-CF1 1/10000, anti-CRD1 1/1000, anti-IE37 1/3000, anti-OEP21 1/500, anti-PORA-PORB 1/1000, anti-PORC 1/1000, anti-LHCB2 (Agrisera) 1/5000, anti-LHCA2 (Agrisera) 1/2000, anti-cytochrome f 1/5000, anti-CP43 1/500, anti-D1 (Agrisera) 1/1000, anti-CHLH 1/200, anti-CHLD 1/500, anti-CHLI 1/200, anti-green fluorescent protein (Euromedex) 1/3000. Primary antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) and the chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR and Northern Blot Analysis—For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated using the Invisorb Spin Plant RNA Mini kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitek) followed by a DNase treatment using the RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). A PCR reaction was performed on RNA with primers for the RPL21 gene (5′-TCCACTGCGTCGACGTCTCG-3′ and 5′-CTCCAACTGCAACATTGGGCG-3′) to check for the absence of genomic DNA. Reverse transcription was performed on 500 ng of total RNA using the ProSTAR First-Strand RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was calibrated by non-saturating PCR reaction (22 cycles) using primers designed to amplify the EF1–4α cDNAs (5′-CTGCTAACTTCACCTCCCAG-3′ and 5′-TGGTGGGTACTCAGAGAAGG-3′). A parallel set of reactions without the addition of reverse transcriptase was run as a quality control. To analyze CHLM expression, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed with TL251 and TL252 primers (see above). The luciferase reporter gene expression was analyzed using two specific primers (5′-CCCGGCGCCATTCTATCC-3′ and 5′-TGAAATCCCTGGTAATCCG-3′). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted as described by Nagy et al. (29Nagy F. Boutry M. Hsu M.Y. Wong M. Chua N.H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA were separated on an agarose gel. RNA blot hybridization and membrane washing were performed on Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The IE37 probe was obtained by PCR amplification on a RT reaction by using specific primers (5′-CACCTAGACTCTCGGTGGC-3′ and 5′-TTTGGGAACGATCTGATCC-3′). The 25 S probe was used as a loading control (30Logemann J. Mayer J.E. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopy—Leaves were observed with an immersion 40× objective at room temperature by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP2 operating system. EYFP and chlorophyll fluorescence were excited, respectively, at 488 and 633 nm. Fluorescence emission was collected from 500 to 535 nm for EYFP and from 643 to 720 nm for chlorophyll. Characterization of a Magnesium Protoporphyrin IX Methyltransferase Null Mutant—An Arabidopsis chlm mutant line was identified by screening the flanking sequence tag data base derived from the T-DNA insertion lines of the Versailles collection (31Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar, 32Samson F. Brunaud V. Balzergue S. Dubreucq B. Lepiniec L. Pelletier G. Caboche M. Lecharny A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using the CHLM cDNA as query sequence (6Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). PCR genotyping and kanamycin selection resulted in the selection of plants that were heterozygous for insertion of a T-DNA in the CHLM gene. Sequencing of the PCR-genotyping product and further PCR analysis showed that the insertion of the T-DNA in the single intron present in the coding sequence resulted in the deletion of the 5′ part of the gene including the entire first exon (Fig. 1A). A mutant line with 3:1 kanamycin segregation as expected for a single genomic insertion was chosen for further analyses. Its progeny shows one-third of the kanamycin-resistant plants being non-green (Fig. 1B), and the yellow/white plants always exhibited a homozygous mutant genotype (Fig. 1C). Thus, the mutation in the CHLM gene is recessive and linked to the albino phenotype. In the homozygous mutant plants, RT-PCR indicated an absence of full-length CHLM transcript (Fig. 1A, middle) and immunoblotting confirmed the absence of CHLM protein (Fig. 1, A, right, and C). Because the yellow/white plants could not produce seeds, homozygous mutants were only obtained from heterozygous plants. During silique maturation, some white seeds were visible, suggesting the absence of chlorophyll in the cotyledons of the homozygous seeds (Fig. 1B). However, after desiccation, the seed color heterogeneity was no longer visible, making it impossible to visualize the mutant at this stage. When germinated on MS-agar containing 0.5% sucrose and under medium light (70 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), the homozygous seedlings turned white and stopped growth after cotyledon development. However, when the plants were transferred after 5 days in medium light to dim light (5 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), they could develop, although very slowly and with a stunted appearance; they then formed small yellow leaves (Fig. 1B). The absence of chlorophyll in the yellow homozygous plants was verified by spectrophotometry (Fig. 2A). Complementation of the mutant with the CHLM cDNA sequence resulted in expression of the CHLM protein and restoration of the green phenotype (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these results indicate that this chlm mutant is an magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase null mutant and that the CHLM gene plays a unique role in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in higher plants. Accumulation of Magnesium Protoporphyrin IX—Fluorescence analysis and HPLC separation of acetone extracts showed that magnesium protoporphyrin IX was the main chlorophyll intermediate present in the mutant (Fig. 2, B and C). When the mutant was fed with ALA to increase the synthesis of intermediates, we observed an increase of magnesium protoporphyrin IX, whereas magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester and other downstream chlorophyll intermediates were absent (Fig. 2C). Conversely, in the wild type, fluorescent spectra indicated the presence of downstream chlorophyll intermediates, and magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester was detected by HPLC when the wild type was fed with ALA. Altogether the data indicated that in the chlm mutant, the chlorophyll pathway is indeed blocked in the methyltransferase step, leading to accumulation of magnesium protoporphyrin IX. Absence of Chlorophyll-containing Protein Complexes in the chlm Mutant—To evaluate chloroplast development in the mutant, we analyzed the expression of a series of proteins in leaves of plants grown 20 days in medium/dim light conditions. After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, we observed that the profiles of total protein extracts from wild type and mutant were similar (Fig. 3A). The large subunit of Rubisco was apparently present at a similar level in both types of plants. However, a major difference was visible at the molecular size expected for LHCII proteins (Fig. 3A, arrow). Immunoblot detection confirmed considerable reduction in the accumulation of a number of major thylakoid-associated proteins including components of photosystem I (LHCI), photosystem II (LHCII, D1, CP43), and the cytochrome b6f complex (Cyt f) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, no significant change was visible in the levels of stromal proteins KARI and HSP70β, chloroplast envelope proteins IE37 and OEP21, or thylakoid protein CF1 from CF1-CF0 ATPase (Fig. 3B). The chlm null mutant was therefore devoid of the major chlorophyll-containing protein complexes. The chlm Mutant Behaves as a “Super Repressor” of Nuclear Photosynthesis Genes—Several processes can induce depletion in chlorophyll-containing proteins, from gene expression to protein turn over. Northern blot analysis indicated that very little change was observed for the expression of chloroplast genes PSBA, PSBD, and PETA, whereas the corresponding proteins (D1, CP43, and cytochrome f (Cyt f)) were absent (compare Figs. 3B and 4A, top). This result confirms that the accumulation of plastid-encoded chloroplast proteins is mostly regulated at a translational or posttranslational level. In contrast, the levels of LHCB transcripts and, to a lesser extent, RBCS transcripts, were reduced in the chlm mutant, whereas the levels of mRNA for the chloroplast inner envelope protein IE37 (33Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13281-13286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of 25 S cytosolic ribosomal RNA were not affected (Fig. 4A, bottom). To verify that the low amount of LHCB mRNA in the chlm mutant was related to transcriptional repression, we crossed a heterozygous CHLM/chlm plant with a line harboring an LHCB promoter-luciferase construct and compared the LHCB promoter-dependent expression of the luciferase reporter gene in the wild-type and chlm mutant backgrounds. We observed no luciferase mRNA in the chlm mutant (Fig. 4B), indicating that the decrease of LHCB mRNA accumulation in the mutant is due to transcriptional repression. Moreover, in an assay for the gun (genome uncoupled) phenotype as defined by Susek et al. (22Susek R.E. Ausubel F.M. Chory J. Cell. 1993; 74: 787-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), we compared LHCB mRNA accumulation in wild-type and chlm mutant plants grown either in the absence or in the presence of Norfluorazon (Fig. 4C). We observed that photobleaching by Norflurazon induced even stronger repression of the LHCB gene in the chlm mutant compared with the wild type, indicating that this mutant does not show a gun phenotype (compare Fig. 4C, second and fourth lanes). This is not surprising because this mutant is expected to accumulate greater amounts of magnesium protoporphyrin IX through a direct effect on the biosynthetic pathway. Interestingly, the extent of repression observed in the chlm mutant in the absence of Norflurazon is even stronger than that observed in wild-type plants treated with Norfluorazon. This indicates that the chlm mutant behaves more like a super repressor of LHCB gene expression. In conclusion, in the chlm null mutant, the chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling seems to be turned on without any additional treatment. Up-regulation of CHLH—Besides the role of magnesium protoporphyrin IX in the plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway, published data suggest an additional role for certain enzymes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway, such as the magnesium chelatase subunits (20Mochizuki N. Brusslan J.A. Larkin R. Nagatani A. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We analyzed how these proteins are affected in the chlm mutant. Immunoblot analysis showed that the CHLD and CHLI subunits of the magnesium chelatase, the CRD1 subunit of the cyclase, and the POR proteins are present in similar amounts, whereas the CHLH magnesium chelatase subunit is five to eight times more abundant in the mutant than in the wild type (Fig. 5A). In the chlm-complemented mutant, the level of CHLH protein is reduced, although not quite to the wild-type level (Fig. 5B), indicating that CHLM depletion leads to a specific increase in the level of the CHLH subunit of the magnesium chelatase. Northern blot analyses indicated that, in the chlm mutant compared with the wild type, there were similar or barely lower levels of CHLH and CHLD transcripts (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the up-regulation of the CHLH subunit occurs at a post-transcriptional level in the chlm mutant. CHLH Is Matured and Accumulates Inside Plastids—As an initial step to elucidate the regulatory mechanism leading to this accumulation, we checked if CHLH is located inside and/or outside plastids in the chlm mutant. Because isolation of plastids from these plants was not possible, we indirectly addressed this question by testing for the presence of a unprocessed CHLH precursor in the chlm mutant. The precursor protein was expected at 154 kDa and the mature protein at 144 kDa. When running on a high molecular weight-resolving gel, CHLH was visualized around 144 kDa, clearly below the 150-kDa marker, and the size of the protein was similar in both the wild type and the mutant, suggesting that most of the CHLH protein, if not all, is matured and most probably addressed to plastids. The accumulation of processed CHLH protein in the chlm mutant could be related either to an increased stability of the protein in the chlm plastids or a more efficient import of the precursor form into chlm plastids. To verify the capability of the CHLH transit peptide for sorting the protein to chloroplasts, we expressed this peptide fused to the N-terminal end of EYFP in wild-type and chlm plants and analyzed the localization of the fusion protein. In the wild-type, EYFP and chlorophyll fluorescence colocalized, indicating a chloroplast targeting of the EYFP protein. Aggregation of part of the EYFP in the chloroplasts is likely because additional highly fluorescent spots of EYFP were visible in the chlorophyll fluorescence area (Fig. 6B). In the chlm mutant where chlorophyll is absent, the same image of EYFP fluorescence was observed, suggesting the same plastid localization (data not shown). To discriminate between an increased stability of CHLH or a more efficient import into chlm plastids, we compared the accumulation of the EYFP fusion protein in CHLH transit peptide-EYFP transgenic plants cosegregating for the chlm T-DNA (Fig. 6C). The size of the EYFP fusion protein in each plant was similar and corresponded to EYFP without the transit peptide, and its accumulation was not different. Our conclusion is that the CHLH transit peptide is still capable of addressing the precursor protein into chloroplasts even in the chlm mutant context and that its import capacity is not modified in the chlm mutant. Therefore, the accumulation of the CHLH protein in the chlm mutant probably occurs at a posttranslocational level. CHLM Is a Key Gene for Chlorophyll Biosynthesis and Chloroplast Development—Our results show that chlorophyll formation is totally dependent on the CHLM gene product in Arabidopsis. The inactivation of this gene prevents setting up of chlorophyll-binding proteins in the thylakoids, whereas most other proteins in the chloroplast remain relatively stable. Not only photosystem I and II with their associated light harvesting complex are affected but also the cytochrome b6f complex that contains very low amounts of chlorophyll (34Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 35Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar, 36Pierre Y. Chabaud E. Herve P. Zito F. Popot J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll is required for maturation of chlorophyll-binding proteins, for correct folding of the complexes, and for their insertion in the thylakoids (for review, see Ref. 1Paulsen H. Aro E.M. Anderson B. in Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration: Regulation of Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 219-233Google Scholar). It also has a stabilizing effect on complexes; complexes lacking chlorophyll proteins becoming substrates for proteases. This was reported for chloroplast-encoded proteins such as D1, CP43, and cytochrome f (37Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rudiger W. Muller B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and it may explain the absence of these proteins in the mutant since we effectively observed that the corresponding mRNAs were expressed at relatively normal levels. Modification of Expression of Nuclear-encoded Photosynthetic Genes—On the opposite, the level of LHCB mRNAs is greatly decreased in the mutant due to transcriptional regulation. Because the mutant specifically accumulates magnesium protoporphyrin IX without any treatment, our result provides an independent indication that magnesium protoporphyrin IX is a negative effector of nuclear photosynthetic gene expression, as previously suggested in Norfluorazon-treated plants (19Strand A. Asami T. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Nature. 2003; 421: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Moreover, the chlm mutant behaves like a super repressor of the LHCB promoter and seems more efficient in repressing LHCB expression than plants treated with Norflurazon. The extent of repression may be due to a different level of accumulation of magnesium protoporphyrin IX in the plant. A second possibility may be linked to the complete absence of magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester and its derivatives in the mutant. This suggests that one of these components acts as a positive effector of nuclear photosynthetic gene expression. Magnesium protoporphyrin methyl ester itself may be a positive effector. In support of this latter hypothesis (24Gadjieva R. Axelsson E. Olsson U. Hansson M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), have shown that, in the absence of Norflurazon, the barley xantha l mutant that is defective in the magnesium protoporphyrin methyl ester cyclase, accumulates magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester and has a high level of LHCB expression. In addition, Alawady and Grimm (8Alawady A.E. Grimm B. Plant J. 2005; 41: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported positive correlation between LHCB expression and methyltransferase activity in tobacco CHLM antisense and sense RNA mutants. The activity of magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase is obviously dependent on the availability of magnesium protoporphyrin IX but is also certainly adjusted to levels of Ado-Met and Ado-Hcy in the chloroplast (see, for instance, Ref. 38Ravanel S. Block M.A. Rippert P. Jabrin S. Curien G. Rebeille F. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22548-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The differential effects of magnesium protoporphyrin IX and magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester on LHCB expression would consequently finely attune the synthesis of light-harvesting complexes to the one-carbon metabolism. Increase of CHLH Level—In the chlm mutant we observed a strong increase in the level of mature CHLH, whereas that of CHLH mRNA was slightly reduced. Our data indicate that stabilization of the protein inside chloroplasts probably occurs in the chlm mutant. One possible mechanistic explanation for this accumulation could be traced to the increased level of magnesium protoporphyrin IX in this mutant. Indeed, a tight channeling of substrate between the magnesium chelatase and the methyltransferase has been suspected for a long time due to the absence of detectable magnesium protoporphyrin intermediates in standard conditions (39Gorchein A. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, the physical interaction between CHLM and CHLH has been shown (40Hinchigeri S.B. Hundle B. Richards W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Alawady A. Reski R. Yaronskaya E. Grimm B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 57: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). During diurnal growth, the magnesium chelatase activity peaks during the transfer from dark to light, whereas the methyltransferase activity maximum follows only a few hours later. During this period, the magnesium protoporphyrin IX level is transiently higher than that of magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyl ester (7Alawady A. Reski R. Yaronskaya E. Grimm B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 57: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is possible that magnesium protophorphyrin IX binds to CHLH, preventing the transitory accumulation of free magnesium protoporphyrin IX when CHLM is not sufficiently present/active. This could both stabilize the rapidly turning over CHLH protein (5Nakayama M. Masuda T. Bando T. Yamagata H. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and protect it against major photooxidative damage generated by free magnesium protoporphyrin IX. Whatever the mechanism underlying CHLH accumulation, one can question whether its concomitant increase with magnesium protoporphyrin IX plays a role in mediating the plastid-to-nucleus regulatory pathway.

P2X7 receptors are ATP-gated cation channels that can induce formation of large membrane pores. Disruption of the gene encoding the P2X7 receptor leads to decreased periosteal bone formation and insensitivity of the skeleton to mechanical stimulation. Our purpose was to investigate signaling pathways coupled to P2X7 activation in osteoblasts. Live cell imaging showed that ATP or 2 ′,3 ′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP), but not UTP, UDP, or 2-methylthio-ADP, induced dynamic membrane blebbing in calvarial osteoblasts. Blebbing was observed in calvarial cells from wildtype but not P2X7 knock-out mice. P2X7 receptors coupled to activation of phospholipase D and A2, inhibition of which suppressed BzATP-induced blebbing. Activation of these phospholipases leads to production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA caused dynamic blebbing in osteoblasts from both wild-type and P2X7 knock-out mice, similar to that induced by BzATP in wildtype cells. However, LPA-induced blebbing was more rapid in onset and was not affected by inhibition of phospholipase D or A2. Blockade or desensitization of LPA receptors suppressed blebbing in response to LPA and BzATP, without affecting P2X7-stimulated pore formation. Thus, LPA functions downstream of P2X7 receptors to induce membrane blebbing. Furthermore, inhibition of Rho-associated kinase abolished blebbing induced by both BzATP and LPA. In summary, we propose a novel signaling axis that links P2X7 receptors through phospholipases to production of LPA and activation of Rho-associated kinase.

In response to the appropriate cues, cells of mesenchymal origin differentiate to become mature osteoblasts that lay down the organic matrix of bone, which subsequently mineralizes (1Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Some of these cells become osteocytes, trapped inside the matrix but still connected to each other by cell processes. This network of osteoblasts and osteocytes is suggested to be part of the mechanotransduction system in bone (2Turner C.H. Robling A.G. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 2629-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that extracellular nucleotides and their receptors on these cells mediate responses of the skeleton to mechanical loading.In many cell types, nucleotides are released in response to a variety of stimuli, including stretch, hypoxia, osmotic swelling. and cell lysis (3Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Fluid shear induces ATP release from osteoblast-like cells in vitro (4Genetos D.C. Geist D.J. Liu D. Donahue H.J. Duncan R.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that osteoblasts and osteocytes release nucleotides such as ATP in response to mechanical loading in vivo (5Dixon S.J.

Extracellular nucleotides bind to cell surface P2 receptors, either P2X, which are ATP-gated nonselective cation channels, or P2Y, which are G protein-coupled receptors. There are seven subtypes of P2X (P2X1-7) and eight subtypes of P2Y (P2Y1, -2, -4, -6, and -11-14) receptors currently identified in mammals.Osteoblasts express multiple subtypes of P2X and P2Y receptors (5Dixon S.J.

Interestingly, disruption of the gene encoding the P2X7 receptor results in an osteopenic phenotype involving decreased periosteal bone formation by osteoblasts and increased trabecular bone resorption by osteoclasts (7Ke H.Z.

Furthermore, stimulation of periosteal bone growth by mechanical loading is markedly attenuated in mice lacking the P2X7 receptor (8Li J. Liu D. Ke H.Z. Duncan R.L. Turner C.H. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 16: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the signaling pathways that may be activated by these receptors in osteoblasts are not known.Like other P2X receptors, P2X7 subunits consist of two transmembrane domains with an extracellular loop and intracellular N and C termini (11Khakh B.S. North R.A. Nature. 2006; 442: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Functional receptors are homomeric consisting of multiple P2X7 subunits. The P2X7 receptor behaves as a nonselective cation channel, and its activation can lead to the formation of pores permeable to hydrophilic molecules as large as 900 Da (12Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). It has remained controversial as to whether pore formation arises by dilation of the channel or activation of a separate pore complex (13Liang L. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C240-C242Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with recent evidence favoring the latter possibility (14Pelegrin P. Surprenant A.

The mechanism underlying membrane blebbing is thought to involve actomyosin contraction, but the initiating events are poorly understood. Interestingly, cell shape and tension generated by actomyosin have been shown to regulate osteoblast differentiation from human mesenchymal stem cells (21McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M.

The resulting lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) then acts on its receptors on osteoblasts to cause dynamic membrane blebbing via a pathway dependent on Rho-associated kinase. The P2X7-LPA axis may be of general significance for the formation of membrane blebs in other systems and for P2X7-mediated osteogenesis during skeletal development and mechanotransduction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—α-Minimum essential medium (α-MEM), heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, antibiotic solution (penicillin 10,000 units/ml; streptomycin 10,000 units/ml; amphotericin B 25 μg/ml), and phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Invitrogen. Bovine albumin (crystallized) was from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Nucleotides, LPA (1-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate), and collagenase type II were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2-AM and FM4-64 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 1-Butanol, Y-27632, and ethidium bromide were from EMD Bioscience, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). tert-Butanol was from Fisher. Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), arachidonyl methyl ketone (AACOCH3), and bromoenol lactone (BEL) were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [U-14C]Glycerol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. VPC-32183 was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Nucleotides were dissolved in the appropriate buffer, PLA2 inhibitors and Y-27632 were dissolved in Me2SO, and stock solutions of LPA and VPC-32183 were prepared in buffer containing 3% bovine albumin.Animals—Generation of the P2rx7-deficient mouse by targeted disruption of the gene encoding this receptor was described (22Solle M.

Mice were maintained in a mixed genetic background (129Ola × C57Bl/6 × DBA/2) by cross-breeding of P2rx7+/- mice (23Korcok J. Raimundo L.N. Ke H.Z. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These studies were approved by the Council on Animal Care at the University of Western Ontario.Osteoblast Isolation and Morphological Assessment—Calvarial cells were isolated from newborn rats and 5-7-day-old mice using sequential collagenase digestion as described (7Ke H.Z.

Cultures were characterized as osteoblast-enriched based on the following characteristics. Cells exhibited elevation of cAMP in response to parathyroid hormone and expressed transcripts for Runx2, Osterix, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin. Moreover, supplementation of cultures with ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate increased alkaline phosphatase activity and induced the formation of mineralized nodules (data not shown).After 1 week, undifferentiated calvarial cell cultures were trypsinized, plated at density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2, and further cultured for up to 3 days. To perform time-lapse recording, the culture medium was removed and replaced with nominally divalent cation-free buffer consisting of the following (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 5, NaHEPES 20, and glucose 10, pH 7.35 ± 0.02, 290 ± 5 mosmol/liter. In some experiments, cells were bathed in low Ca2+ buffer (containing 0.5 mm CaCl2) or in HEPES-buffered MEM (containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ and 0.8 mm Mg2+). Cells were placed on a heater stage and maintained at ∼35 °C. Time-lapse experiments were carried out using either an inverted phase contrast microscope (Nikon Plan-Fluor ×20 objective, 0.45 numerical aperture) or a Hoffman modulation contrast microscope (Zeiss Plan-NeoFluor ×20 objective, 0.4 numerical aperture or ×40 objective, 0.75 numerical aperture). Brightness, contrast, and gamma adjustments were applied to the images shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 5 using Adobe Photoshop and CorelDraw. For quantitative analyses, the percentages of cells in each field exhibiting zeiosis before and after addition of test substances were determined. Fields obtained using ×20 objectives contained a total of 22 ± 5 cells (mean ± S.D.), and three fields were analyzed from each cell preparation. Experiments were performed on at least three independent preparations (total numbers of cells analyzed for each condition were 198 ± 14, mean ± S.D.).FIGURE 2BzATP acts through P2X7 receptors to induce dynamic membrane blebbing.

Membranes were labeled by incubation with FM4-64 (2 μg/ml) in medium for 10 min at 35-37 °C. Medium was then replaced with nominally divalent cation-free buffer, and cells were observed by confocal microscopy at ∼30 °C (Zeiss model LSM 510, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired using Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×63 objective (1.4 numerical aperture) and 488 nm Ar+ ion laser excitation. The emission was filtered at 560 nm long pass, and images were captured using time-lapse mode. In some experiments, cells were scanned in multiple focal planes parallel to the substrate to create a z-stack.Extraction of Lipids and Thin Layer Chromatography—Primary cultures of rat calvarial cells were trypsinized and plated in supplemented α-MEM at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2. After 1 day, cultures were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [14C]glycerol in serum-free α-MEM for 18 h. Medium containing unincorporated radiolabel was then replaced with nominally divalent cation-free buffer at 37 °C containing inhibitors or vehicle. After 10 min, nucleotide was added. After a further 20 min, buffer was removed, and lipids were extracted from the cell layer by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar). Extracts were dried under a stream of N2 and dissolved in chloroform together with unlabeled reference membrane lipids. Silica gel plates (LK4D, Whatman Inc., Florham, NJ) were sprayed with a solution of magnesium acetate (0.1 m) and oxalic acid (0.2 m). After the plates were dried, samples were loaded and separated by thin layer chromatography using the following solvent system (by volume) 34:30:35:6.5 ethanol:chloroform:triethylamine:water. Following chromatography, plates were sprayed with primulin (0.1 mm) in 80% acetone and examined under UV light. Regions of silica gel defined by reference lipids were collected, and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Fluorescence Measurement of Cytosolic Free Calcium Concentration ([Ca2+]i)—Cells were loaded by incubation with fura-2-AM (2 μm) in culture medium without serum for 30 min at 37 °C. Cultures then were washed, superfused continuously with nominally divalent cation-free buffer, and examined using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon Fluor ×40 objective, 1.3 numerical aperture). The fluorescence emission at 510 nm with alternate excitation wavelengths of 345 and 380 nm was measured from individual cells using a Deltascan illumination system (Photon Technology International, London, Ontario, Canada). Fluorescence intensities at 345 and 380 nm were corrected for background by subtraction of values obtained from a region with no cells and the ratio used to calculate [Ca2+]i. Test substances were dissolved in nominally divalent cation-free buffer and superfused onto single osteoblasts using pressure ejection from micropipettes positioned 30-50 μm from the cell (Picospritzer II, General Valve Corp., Fairfield, NJ).Pore Formation Assay—To assess pore formation, we measured uptake of ethidium bromide as described (7Ke H.Z. Qi H. Weidema A.F. Zhang Q. Panupinthu N. Crawford D.T. Grasser W.A. Paralkar V.M. Li M. Audoly L.P. Gabel C.A. Jee W.S. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Thompson D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1356-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Calvarial cells were incubated in nominally divalent cation-free buffer for 10 min at 37 °C with inhibitors or vehicle. BzATP or its vehicle was then added for 12 min together with ethidium bromide (20 μg/ml). For some experiments, buffer was then replaced with fresh buffer containing Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) for 5 min to reveal nuclei. Cells were then washed and examined using an Axiovert S100 epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Other samples were washed and images acquired by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×25 objective (0.8 numerical aperture) and 543 nm HeNe laser excitation. The emission was filtered at 560 nm long pass. Total numbers of cells from the same fields were counted using transmitted light images. Four fields were analyzed from each cell preparation, and experiments were performed on at least three independent preparations.Statistical Analyses—Data are shown as means ± S.D. or S.E., as indicated. Differences between two groups were assessed using t tests. Differences among three or more groups were evaluated by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey or Bonferroni multiple comparison tests (respectively). Sigmoidal curves were fit by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism. Differences were accepted as statistically significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSThe P2X7 Agonist BzATP Induces Dynamic and Reversible Membrane Blebbing in Osteoblasts—Based on nucleotide-induced pore formation, we have shown previously that a subpopulation of calvarial cells expresses functional P2X7 receptors (7Ke H.Z. Qi H. Weidema A.F. Zhang Q. Panupinthu N. Crawford D.T. Grasser W.A. Paralkar V.M. Li M. Audoly L.P. Gabel C.A. Jee W.S. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Thompson D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1356-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Here we first monitored the morphology of murine osteoblasts using time-lapse Hoffman modulation contrast microscopy. Cultures were placed into a heater stage (∼35 °C) and recorded using time-lapse for 10 min in nominally divalent cation-free buffer (Fig. 1, Before). Within this period, few cells exhibited membrane blebs (Fig. 1A, Before). Cultures were then treated with either 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP, a relatively potent P2X7 agonist, 300 μm) or vehicle (Control) for 20 min. BzATP caused dramatic changes in osteoblast morphology, including initial cellular retraction followed by the formation of dynamic plasma membrane blebs (zeiosis) with latency to onset of 4-6 min (Fig. 1A, BzATP; see also supplemental Movie 1). Blebs enlarged and shrank in an asynchronous pattern with a mean lifetime of 1.2 ± 0.3 min (n = 8 blebs, three cells from three independent preparations). When BzATP was removed following 20 min, blebbing activity ceased within 5-10 min and cells respread (Fig. 1A, Wash), indicating reversibility.We quantified the percentage of cells exhibiting zeiosis before and during the 20-min treatment interval. Although vehicle alone did not induce a significant change in the percentage of blebbing cells, BzATP treatment induced dynamic membrane blebbing in ∼40% of cells in this series of experiments (Fig. 1B). Similar responses were observed in rat calvarial cells, indicating that blebbing is not restricted to murine osteoblasts.Because membrane blebbing can be associated with apoptosis, we quantified the reversibility of BzATP-induced blebbing in murine osteoblasts. In this series of experiments, BzATP (300 μm, 20 min) induced blebbing in 40% of cells. Within 60 min following removal of BzATP, only 9% of cells exhibited blebbing (Fig. 1C), which was not significantly different from pretreatment values. Thus, blebbing induced in response to short term treatment with BzATP is fully reversible, ruling out the possibility that BzATP induces acute cell death.We also examined the ability of BzATP to induce blebbing in the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+. Under these conditions, BzATP induced retraction and blebbing of murine osteoblasts (Fig. 1D). A similar percentage of cells exhibited blebbing in the presence of divalent cations (Fig. 1E) as in nominally divalent cation-free buffer (Fig. 1B). However, it should be noted that a higher concentration of BzATP (1 mm) was required to induce this response in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Subsequent studies were performed using nominally divalent cation-free or low Ca2+ buffers.Dynamic changes in morphology of individual cells were characterized using confocal microscopy. Murine osteoblasts were first loaded with the fluorescent dye FM4-64 to stain membranes. Cells were incubated in nominally divalent cationfree buffer and exposed to BzATP (300 μm). BzATP induced the formation of multiple dynamic blebs (Fig. 1F). Blebs enlarged and shrunk in an asynchronous pattern with maximum diameters up to ∼8 μm. Observation of a series of optical sections parallel to the substratum after a 10-min stimulation with BzATP revealed that blebbing occurred over the entire cell surface and that blebs did not contain FM4-64-stained intracellular membranes (Fig. 1G).P2X7 Activation Is Required for Nucleotide-induced Blebbing in Osteoblasts—BzATP can activate a number of P2 nucleotide receptors besides P2X7 (25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). To elucidate which subtype(s) of P2 receptors cause blebbing in osteoblasts, we tested the effects of a variety of P2X and P2Y agonists in murine and rat osteoblasts. Before stimulation with nucleotides, few murine cells exhibited membrane blebs (Fig. 2A, Before). UTP activates several P2Y receptors but does not activate any P2X receptors (3Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Although UTP (100 μm) did not induce blebbing, BzATP (300 μm) caused robust membrane blebbing (Fig. 2A).UDP (100 μm), which activates P2Y6 receptors, did not initiate blebbing (Fig. 2B). Similarly, 2-methylthio-ADP (a potent and selective P2Y1 receptor agonist) failed to induce blebbing, even at concentrations up to 3 mm (Fig. 2C). Concentrations of ATP (≤100 μm) that are sufficient to activate many P2X and P2Y receptors (but not P2X7) did not induce blebbing, whereas higher concentrations (≥300 μm) of ATP did. Consistent with the involvement of P2X7, BzATP was more potent than ATP (Fig. 2C; EC50 was 90 μm for BzATP versus 310 μm for ATP).To determine unambiguously whether P2X7 receptors mediate membrane blebbing in osteoblasts, we compared responses of calvarial cells isolated from wild-type (WT) and P2X7 knock-out (KO) mice. There was no difference in the appearance of WT and P2X7 KO osteoblasts before stimulation with BzATP (Fig. 2D, Before). Notably, BzATP (300 μm) induced robust membrane blebbing only in WT osteoblasts (Fig. 2D, BzATP). Approximately 40% of WT cells responded to BzATP with membrane blebbing, whereas there was no significant effect in P2X7 KO cells (Fig. 2E). Taken together, we conclude that nucleotide-induced blebbing in osteoblasts is induced specifically by activation of P2X7 receptors.Effects of Phospholipase Inhibitors on P2X7-mediated Membrane Blebbing—It is poorly understood how activation of P2X7 receptors ultimately leads to membrane blebbing. P2X7 activation stimulates PLD in several cell types, including the human THP-1 monocytic cell line (26Humph"

We recently reported that CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v) on LS174T colon carcinoma cells possess selectin binding activity. Here we extended those findings by showing that T84 and Colo205 colon carcinoma cells bind selectins via sialidase-sensitive O-linked glycans presented on CD44v, independent of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. To assess the functional role of CD44v in selectin-mediated binding, we quantified the adhesion to selectins of T84 cell subpopulations sorted based on their CD44 expression levels and stable LS174T cell lines generated using CD44 short hairpin RNA. High versus low CD44-expressing T84 cells tethered more efficiently to P- and L-selectin, but not E-selectin, and rolled more slowly on P- and E-selectin. Knocking down CD44 expression on LS174T cells inhibited binding to P-selectin and increased rolling velocities over P- and L-selectin relative to control-transfected cells, without affecting tethering and rolling on E-selectin, however. Blot rolling analysis revealed the presence of alternative sialylated glycoproteins with molecular masses of ∼170 and ∼130 kDa, which can mediate selectin binding in CD44-knockdown cells. Heparin diminishes the avidity of colon carcinoma cells for P- and L-selectin, which may compromise integrin-mediated firm adhesion to host cells and mitigate metastasis. Our finding that CD44v is a functional P-selectin ligand on colon carcinoma provides a novel perspective on the enhanced metastatic potential associated with tumor CD44v overexpression and the role of selectins in metastasis.

According to this model, free-flowing PMNs first loosely attach (tether) and roll on the layer of activated endothelial cells via selectin-ligand interactions, then stop, flatten, and squeeze between endothelial cells into the afflicted tissues in an integrin/immunoglobulin superfamily member-dependent manner (1Konstantopoulos K.

In particular, the paradigm of the coordinated action of a selectin-dependent tethering/rolling pathway followed by an integrin-mediated firm adhesion process has been extended to account for maximal binding of colon carcinoma cells to activated endothelium (3Burdick M.M.

Several lines of evidence suggest that selectins facilitate cancer metastasis and tumor cell arrest in the microvasculature by mediating specific interactions between selectin-expressing host cells and ligands on tumor cells. The most convincing evidence for the direct role of P- and L-selectin in the metastatic process is the pronounced inhibition of metastasis in P- and/or L-selectin-deficient mice (P-sel-null, L-sel-null, and PL-sel-double null) compared with wild-type controls in a colon carcinoma cell model (10Borsig L. Wong R. Feramisco J. Nadeau D.R. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3352-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 11Borsig L. Wong R. Hynes R.O. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2193-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Along these lines, enzymatic removal of O-linked mucin-like glycoproteins from colon carcinoma cells resulted in marked reduction of experimental metastasis in a wild-type mouse model (10Borsig L. Wong R. Feramisco J. Nadeau D.R. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3352-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Similarly, endothelial E-selectin has been shown to support metastatic spread in vivo (12Izumi Y. Taniuchi Y. Tsuji T. Smith C.W. Nakamori S. Fidler I.J. Irimura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Brodt P. Fallavollita L. Bresalier R.S. Meterissian S. Norton C.R. Wolitzky B.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Since the selectins are known to recognize HECA-452-reactive sialofucosylated oligosaccharides, such as sialyl Lewis x (sLex), and overexpression of these moieties on tumor cells correlates with poor prognosis and tumor progression (14Kannagi R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 15Kim Y.J. Varki A. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), it appears likely that selectin-mediated adhesion to sialofucosylated target molecules on tumor cells is an important determinant for metastatic spread. To date, the selectin ligands on colon carcinoma cells have yet to be identified and characterized other than by general classifications (i.e. sialofucosylated mucin-like glycoproteins). The binding affinity of selectins for isolated monovalent sLex and its isomer sLea is very low. Consequently, neither expression of the sLex nor the sLea groups per se correlates with the properties of endogenous selectin ligands on cellular targets. As has been argued appropriately in the literature (16Varki A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: S31-35PubMed Google Scholar), distinctions must be drawn between structures than can bind to selectins under certain conditions in vitro and structures that actually do interact with selectins in vivo. To this end, a “functional” selectin ligand should fulfill certain criteria (16Varki A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: S31-35PubMed Google Scholar) as follows: it should be expressed in the right place at the right time; the ligand should bind with some selectivity and relatively high affinity; and removal or absence of the ligand should prevent cell adhesive interactions. We recently reported that O-linked sialofucosylated glycans on CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v) on LS174T colon carcinoma cells possess selectin binding activity (17Hanley W.D. Burdick M.M. Konstantopoulos K. Sackstein R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not reveal a functional role for LS174T CD44v in selectin-mediated adhesion. Moreover, it is not clear whether the selectin binding activity of CD44v is shared by other metastatic colon carcinoma cells. Here we employ two distinct metastatic colon carcinoma cell lines, LS174T and T84, expressing similar surface levels of CD44, and two complementary strategies to modulate CD44 expression to assess whether CD44v is a functional selectin ligand on colon carcinoma cells under physiological shear conditions. By perfusing subsets of T84 cells, sorted based on their CD44 expression levels, over purified selectin substrates, we show that high versus low CD44-expressing cells (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), 1731 versus 364) bind more efficiently to P- and L- but not E-selectin and roll more slowly on P- and E-selectin. These data highlight the role of avidity in CD44v binding to P- or L-selectin and implicate CD44v as an auxiliary E-selectin ligand on colon carcinoma, which is engaged in the stabilization of tumor cell-endothelial cell adhesive interactions against fluid shear. Furthermore, stable LS174T cell lines generated using CD44 short hairpin (sh)-RNA display markedly reduced (>95%) CD44 surface expression and tether to P- but not L- or E-selectin with an ∼55% efficiency relative to untreated or control-transfected cells. Interestingly, this intervention did not alter the rolling velocity of CD44-knockdown LS174T cells relative to control cells on E-selectin. The lack of significant inhibition of cell tethering to L-selectin and the absence of modulation of the rolling velocity on E-selectin are attributed to the presence of sialofucosylated glycans on alternative selectin ligands with apparent molecular masses of ∼130 and ∼170 kDa in CD44-knockdown cells. Taken altogether, these data provide functional evidence that CD44v is a major functional P- but not L- or E-selectin ligand on colon carcinoma cells. Our findings offer a unifying perspective on the apparent enhanced metastatic potential associated with tumor cell CD44v overexpression and the critical role of selectins in metastasis. Adhesion Molecules, Antibodies, and Reagents—The chimeric forms of L-selectin-IgG Fc (L-selectin), P-selectin-IgG Fc (P-selectin), and E-selectin-IgG Fc (E-selectin), consisting of the lectin, epidermal growth factor, and consensus repeat domains for human L-, P-, or E-selectin linked to each arm of human IgG1, were generous gifts of Wyeth External Research (Cambridge, MA) (19Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Anti-CD44 (2C5) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Alkaline phosphatase (AP)- and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and AP-conjugated anti-rat IgM were from Southern Biotech Associates (Birmingham, AL). All other unlabeled and phycoerythrin (PE)- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies were from BD Biosciences. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—The human colorectal carcinoma cell lines T84, Colo205, and LS174T were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in the recommended media. Prior to cell lysis, colon carcinoma cells were detached from culture flasks using Enzyme Free Cell Dissociation Media (15 min at 37 °C; Chemicon, Phillipsburg, NJ). For flow cytometric/sorting and flow-based adhesion assays, T84 and LS174T cells were harvested by mild trypsinization (0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C) and subsequently incubated (107 cells/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h to allow regeneration of surface glycoproteins (7McCarty O.J.

CD44 was immunoprecipitated from colon carcinoma cell lysate with an anti-CD44 mAb, 2C5, using recombinant protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) (18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Whole cell lysate or immunopurified CD44 was diluted with reducing sample buffer and separated using 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) (17Hanley W.D. Burdick M.M. Konstantopoulos K. Sackstein R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K.

Resolved proteins were transferred to Sequi-blot or Immun-blot polyvinylidene difluoride or Sequi-blot nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked with StartingBlock (Pierce) for 15 min. Immunoblots were stained with HECA-452 or anti-CD44 (2C5) mAbs and rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. In all cases, duplicate immunoblots were stained in parallel with irrelevant isotype control primary antibodies to assess nonspecific binding to protein bands. Subsequently, blots were incubated with appropriate AP- or HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Western Blue AP substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) were used to develop the AP- and HRP-conjugated antibody-stained immunoblots, respectively. Blot Rolling Assay—Blots of immunopurified CD44 from T84 or Colo205 whole cell lysate or whole cell lysate from untreated, mammalian scramble, or CD44-knockdown LS174T cells were stained with anti-CD44 (2C5) or HECA-452 mAbs and rendered translucent by immersion in 90% D-PBS, 10% glycerol (23Fuhlbrigge R.C. King S.L. Dimitroff C.J. Kupper T.S. Sackstein R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5645-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The blots were placed under a parallel plate flow chamber, and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or CHO transfectants, resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 90% D-PBS, 10% glycerol, were perfused at the shear stress of 0.5 dyne/cm2. Molecular weight markers were used as guides to aid placement of the flow chamber over stained bands of interest. The number of interacting cells per lane was averaged over ×10 fields of view (0.55 mm2 each). Nonspecific adhesion was assessed by perfusion by adding 10 mm EDTA in the flow medium. Preparation of CD44-coated Microspheres—Immunoprecipitated CD44 from control and metabolically inhibited T84 whole cell lysate was diluted to desired concentrations with binding buffer (0.2 m carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.2), and incubated with 10-μm polystyrene microspheres (2.5 × 107 microspheres/ml; Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation (18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Microspheres were washed twice with D-PBS and subsequently blocked with D-PBS, 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Microspheres were resuspended (2 × 106 microspheres/ml) in D-PBS, 0.1% BSA for use in flow cytometric and flow chamber assays. Site densities of CD44-coated microspheres were determined by flow cytometry (18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Treatments—To remove terminal sialic acid residues, T84 CD44-coated microspheres were incubated with 0.1 unit/ml Vibrio cholerae sialidase (Roche Applied Science) for 90 min at 37 °C (18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In select experiments, CD44-coated microsphere suspensions were incubated for 6 h at 37°C with 3.6 units/ml Flavobacterium heparinum heparitinase to specifically digest heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (24Nader H.B.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). Site densities of CD44 adsorbed onto microspheres following enzymatic treatments were determined by flow cytometry and confirmed to be equivalent to untreated controls before use in adhesion assays. Inhibitor Treatments—Prior to metabolic inhibitor studies, T84 cell suspensions (107 cells/ml) were pretreated with 0.1 unit/ml V. cholerae sialidase for 60 min at 37 °C to remove terminal sialic acid residues and to ensure de novo synthesis of newly generated HECA-452 reactive carbohydrate structures (17Hanley W.D. Burdick M.M. Konstantopoulos K. Sackstein R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Complete removal of sialic acid was confirmed via flow cytometry using the mAb HECA-452 that recognizes sialic acid-bearing epitopes. Subsequently, T84 cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in medium containing either 2 mm benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (benzyl-GalNAc) to inhibit O-linked glycosylation (18Hanley W.D.

Sanford B.A. Molyneux R.J. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3975-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); D-PBS diluent was used for control untreated cells. Flow Cytometry—CD29, CD44, and HECA-452 expression levels on LS174T and T84 cells as well as CD44 and HECA-452 site densities on microspheres were quantified by single-color immunofluorescence and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences) using PE-conjugated anti-CD29 (MAR4), anti-CD44 (515), or HECA-452 antibodies. Background levels were determined by incubating cell or microsphere suspensions with properly matched PE-conjugated isotype control antibodies (18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cell Sorting by Flow Cytometry—T84 colon carcinoma cells (107 cells/ml) were incubated with an anti-CD44 mAb (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated G44-26 or PE-conjugated 515) or a fluorescently labeled isotype control antibody for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Using a flow cytometer/sorter (FACSAria; BD Biosciences), the highest and lowest (above isotype control staining) 10% of CD44-expressing T84 cells were collected into separate growth medium-filled centrifuge tubes. Subsequently, cell suspensions were centrifuged, resuspended to a concentration of 5 × 105/ml in D-PBS, 0.1% BSA, and immediately used in flow-based adhesion assays. Preparation of CD44 siRNA Oligonucleotides—Short interfering (si)RNA oligonucleotides (19 nucleotides) targeting exons 1–5 and 15–20 of CD44 were generated using the WI siRNA design program (Whitehead Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Identified target sequences were subjected to BLAST search of the human genome and subsequently filtered to remove sequences that were not specific to CD44. The siRNA sequences were used to construct 60-mer short hairpin (sh)RNA oligonucleotides, which were then synthesized (Operon, Inc., Huntsville, AL), and ligated into the pSUPER.neo.gfp expression vector (Oligoengine, Inc, Seattle, WA) under the control of the H1 promoter. The following oligonucleotide was used (underlined, sense and antisense sequences; boldface, restriction enzyme sites; lightface italics, polIII termination signals; boldface italics, loop with linker): (5′-GATCCCCTGTGCTACTGATTGTTTCATTCAAGAGATGAAACAATCAGTAGCACATTTTTC-3′). The ligated product was transformed into competent DH5α Escherichia coli cells, amplified in the presence of ampicillin, and the plasmid was purified using the EndoFree maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequence insertion was verified by restriction digestion and confirmed by direct sequencing. A tested mammalian scramble sequence (Oligoengine, Inc) was used as a negative control in all siRNA experiments. Generation of Stable CD44-Knockdown Colon Carcinoma Cell Lines—8 × 106 LS174T cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and grown overnight reaching an ∼50% confluency. The cells were then transfected with 32 μg of pSUPER.neo.gfp.CD44S using Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 h. Upon reaching confluency, transfected LS174T cells were passed and 5 × 106 cells seeded per Petri dish in growth medium in triplicate. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by a fresh aliquot containing 500 μg/ml neomycin. Cells were then grown continually without passaging for 15 days, replenishing the neomycin-containing medium every 2–3 days. Single cell colonies were isolated and cultured using standard techniques. Flow-based Adhesion Assays—To simulate the physiological shear environment of the vasculature, colon carcinoma cells or T84 CD44-coated microspheres suspended in D-PBS, 0.1% BSA were perfused over immobilized E-, P- or L-selectin-coated dishes at prescribed wall shear stresses using a parallel plate flow chamber (250 μm channel depth, 5.0 mm channel width) (4Burdick M.M.

Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The extent of adhesion was quantified by perfusing cells/microspheres at either 2 × 106/ml and averaging the total number of cells/beads interacting during 15-s intervals over six ×10 fields of view (0.55 mm2 each) or 1 × 106/ml and enumerating the total number of tethering events in a single ×10 field of view during a 5-min period. Average rolling velocities were computed as the distance traveled by the centroid of the translating cell/microsphere divided by the time interval at the given wall shear stress (4Burdick M.M.

In select experiments, LS174T cells were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with either 5 units/ml heparin or diluent (D-PBS, 0.1% BSA) and used in perfusion assays. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance of differences between means was determined by analysis of variance. If means were shown to be significantly different (p < 0.05), multiple comparisons were performed by the Tukey test. The Selectin Binding Determinants of CD44v on Colon Carcinoma Cells Are Displayed on Sialofucosylated O-Linked Glycans and Are Independent of GAGs—We recently reported that the colon carcinoma cell line LS174T expresses CD44 variant isoforms that display selectin binding activity, implicating these molecules as a link between the up-regulation of CD44v expression and increased metastatic potential (17Hanley W.D. Burdick M.M. Konstantopoulos K. Sackstein R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We sought to quantify the expression of these isoforms on other colon carcinoma cell lines, such as T84 and Colo205, to begin to reveal the breadth of its distribution as a selectin ligand as well as to further characterize its selectin binding characteristics. Western blot analysis of CD44 immunopurified from whole cell lysates of 5 × 106 T84 or Colo205 cells, using the anti-CD44 mAb 2C5, revealed the presence of a relatively weak level of CD44s at ∼100 kDa and a more prominent CD44 signal at ∼150 kDa, which corresponds to CD44v (Fig. 1A, T84, lane 1; Colo205, not shown). Fig. 1A, lane 2, stained with HECA-452, identified the presence of sialofucosylated epitopes, such as sLex, solely on the variant isoforms of CD44 (Fig. 1A, T84, lane 2; Colo205, not shown). A blot rolling assay was next employed to assess the ability of immunopurified CD44 to mediate selectin-dependent adhesion under physiologically relevant levels of shear stress. To this end, L-selectin-expressing human peripheral blood lymphocytes or P- or E-selectin-transfected CHO cells, perfused over SDS-PAGE-resolved immunopurified CD44 protein bands, tethered predominantly over the ∼150-kDa region that corresponds to sialofucosylated CD44v, whereas minimal binding was detected at the ∼100-kDa band of CD44s (T84, Fig. 1B; Colo205; data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that CD44v, but not CD44s, on T84 and Colo205 colon carcinoma cells is capable of interacting efficiently with selectins under physiological flow conditions. We next used a cell-free flow-based adhesion assay to evaluate the adhesion capabilities of microspheres coated with CD44 immunopurified from T84 cells over immobilized E-, P-, or L-selectin. This technique allows quantitative comparisons of CD44-mediated adhesion to purified selectin substrates at identical concentrations under physiological flow conditions. Microspheres, coated with T84 CD44, which displays strong HECA-452 reactivity (supplemental Table 1S), tethered and rolled over all three selectins, albeit with varying efficiencies which correlate with those of intact T84 cells, with E-selectin mediating the slowest rolling and L-selectin the fastest rolling (supplemental Fig. 1S).

https://openalex.org/W2140150081,"Large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels are important for regulating many essential cellular functions, from neuronal action potential shape and firing rate to smooth muscle contractility. In amphibians, reptiles, and birds, BK channels mediate the intrinsic frequency tuning of the cochlear hair cell by an electrical resonance mechanism. In contrast, inner hair cells of the mammalian cochlea are extrinsically tuned by accessory structures of the cochlea. Nevertheless, BK channels are present in inner hair cells and encode a fast activating outward current. To understand the role of the BK channel α and β subunits in mammalian inner hair cells, we analyzed the morphology, physiology, and function of these cells from mice lacking the BK channel α (Slo-/-) and also the β1 and β4 subunits (β1/4-/-). β1/4-/- mice showed normal subcellular localization, developmental acquisition, and expression of BK channels. β1/4-/- mice showed normal cochlear function as indicated by normal auditory brainstem responses and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Slo-/- mice also showed normal cochlear function despite the absence of the BKα subunit and the absence of fast activating outward current from the inner hair cells. Moreover, microarray analyses revealed no compensatory changes in transcripts encoding ion channels or transporters in the cochlea from Slo-/- mice. Slo-/- mice did, however, show increased resistance to noise-induced hearing loss. These findings reveal the fundamentally different contribution of BK channels to nonmammalian and mammalian hearing and suggest that BK channels should be considered a target in the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss. Large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels are important for regulating many essential cellular functions, from neuronal action potential shape and firing rate to smooth muscle contractility. In amphibians, reptiles, and birds, BK channels mediate the intrinsic frequency tuning of the cochlear hair cell by an electrical resonance mechanism. In contrast, inner hair cells of the mammalian cochlea are extrinsically tuned by accessory structures of the cochlea. Nevertheless, BK channels are present in inner hair cells and encode a fast activating outward current. To understand the role of the BK channel α and β subunits in mammalian inner hair cells, we analyzed the morphology, physiology, and function of these cells from mice lacking the BK channel α (Slo-/-) and also the β1 and β4 subunits (β1/4-/-). β1/4-/- mice showed normal subcellular localization, developmental acquisition, and expression of BK channels. β1/4-/- mice showed normal cochlear function as indicated by normal auditory brainstem responses and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Slo-/- mice also showed normal cochlear function despite the absence of the BKα subunit and the absence of fast activating outward current from the inner hair cells. Moreover, microarray analyses revealed no compensatory changes in transcripts encoding ion channels or transporters in the cochlea from Slo-/- mice. Slo-/- mice did, however, show increased resistance to noise-induced hearing loss. These findings reveal the fundamentally different contribution of BK channels to nonmammalian and mammalian hearing and suggest that BK channels should be considered a target in the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss. BK channels regulate many functions, from neuronal action potential shape (1Hu H. Shao L.R. Chavoshy S. Gu N. Trieb M. Behrens R. Laake P. Pongs O. Knaus H.G. Ottersen O.P. Storm J.F. J.

Additionally, transcripts for both the BKβ1 and β4 subunit have been identified in IHCs (22Langer P. Grunder S. Rusch A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 455: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The exact function of BK channels in IHCs is unknown and likely to be different from that in nonmammalian hair cells. Unlike nonmammalian hair cells, IHCs are extrinsically tuned by accessory structures of the cochlea (9Fettiplace R. Fuchs P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 809-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the BK current found in IHCs does not require external calcium for activation (18Kros C.J. Crawford A.C. J. Physiol.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the importance of BK channels for the expression of mammalian hearing has been suggested indirectly in mice: IK,f becomes expressed in mouse IHCs at the onset of hearing (approximately 2 weeks postnatal (19Kros C.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Rusch A. Nature. 1998; 394: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar)), and mice lacking the thyroid hormone receptor β show delayed acquisition of IK,f by the IHCs and dramatically elevated auditory thresholds (27Rusch A. Ng L. Goodyear R. Oliver D. Lisoukov I. Vennstrom B. Richardson G. Kelley M.W. Forrest D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9792-9800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To assess directly the contribution of the BKα and BKβ subunits to mammalian hearing, we analyzed the morphology, physiology, and function of IHCs cells from mice lacking the BKα subunit (Slo-/-) and the BKβ1 and BKβ4 subunits (β1/4-/-). We found normal cochlear function in both Slo-/- and β1/4-/- mice. Slo-/- mice, however, showed increased resistance to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). These findings reveal the fundamentally different contribution of BK channels to nonmammalian and mammalian hearing and suggest that BK channels may be an important target in the prevention of NIHL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Transgenic Mice—Slo-/- were generated as described previously (7Meredith A.L. Thorneloe K.S. Werner M.E. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36746-36752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and maintained on an inbred FVB/NJ background. All results shown are for Slo+/+, Slo+/-, and Slo-/- littermates. β1-/- mice were generated as described previously (6Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and maintained on an inbred C57BL/6 background. β4-/- mice were generated as described previously (28Brenner R. Chen Q.H. Vilaythong A. Toney G.M. Noebels J.L. Aldrich R.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1752-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). β1/4-/- double transgenic mice were generated by breeding inbred β1-/- with outbred β4-/- mice. All genotypes were verified by PCR on genomic tail DNA. Because β4-/- mice were on a mixed background, experiments involving electrophysiology, auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements, and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements were also performed on wild type 129X1/SvJ mice, although only data from wild type C57BL/6 (C57 WT) mice are shown. No differences were detected between β1/4-/- and C57 WT mice with electrophysiology, ABR, or DPOAE. No differences were detected between β1/4-/- and wild type 129X1/SvJ with electrophysiology or ABR. β1/4-/- did have significantly greater magnitude DPOAEs compared with wild type 129X1/SvJ (although noise floors were similar). However, because β1/4-/- mice are genetically more similar to C57 WT mice and because 129X1/SvJ mice are known to have large variations in the magnitudes of their DPOAEs (29Martin G.K. Vazquez A.E. Jimenez A.M. Koivisto D.L. Candreia C.M. Lonsbury-Martin B.L. Association for Research in Otolaryngology Abstracts, Abstr. 21416. Association for Research in Otolaryngology, Mt. Royal, NJ2001Google Scholar), this finding was not investigated further.Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Whole cochleae were dissected from mice and immediately perfused through the round window with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. Cochleae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 2 h at 4°C before being rinsed with PBS. Apical turns of the organs of Corti were excised from the cochleae and blocked in blocking buffer (PBS with 5% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 2 h at room temperature. Turns were incubated in the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, rinsed 3 times for 20 min each in PBT (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100), incubated in the secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 4 h at room temperature, rinsed 3 times for 20 min each in PBT, and rinsed in PBS before mounting on glass slides in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). All incubations and rinses were performed on a rocking table.The mouse monoclonal antibody against the BKα subunit was graciously provided by Dr. James S. Trimmer (University of California, Davis) and used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml as described previously (20Pyott S.J. Glowatzki E. Trimmer J.S. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against the BKα subunit (APC-021) was purchased from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel) and diluted 1:500. The monoclonal antibody against calretinin (diluted 1:1000), the polyclonal antibody against synapsin (diluted 1:300), and the polyclonal antibody against neurofilament-200 (NF200; diluted 1:200) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal antibody against NF200 was graciously provided by Novocastra Laboratories (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) and diluted 1:50. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (diluted 1:100) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and provided graciously by Dr. W. James Nelson (Stanford University). Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 633) were purchased from Molecular Probes and diluted 1:1000.Simultaneous one- or two-color fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica confocal SP2 AOBS (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) with a 63× oil immersion Leica HCX PL APO objective (numerical aperture = 1.4). Z-stacks (∼70 optical sections) were collected at 0.3 μm. Optical sections were combined, and three-dimensional reconstructions were performed through volume rendering using Volocity 2.0.1 (Improvision, Lexington, MA).Electrophysiology—Apical turns of the organ of Corti were excised from mice and used within 1 h of the dissection. Extracellular solution contained 155 mm NaCl, 5.8 mm KCl, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. For indicated experiments, 100 nm iberiotoxin (IBTX; Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK) was added to the extracellular solution and delivered locally via a gravity flow pipette. Pipette solution contained 150 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.2. Recording electrodes were pulled from micropipettes (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA) and coated with wax (KERR sticky wax, Romulus, MI) to minimize electrode capacitance. Pipette resistances in solution were 2-3 megaohms. Total series resistances (at most 5 megaohms) were compensated 70% on-line. The indicated test potentials are not corrected for liquid junction potentials (calculated to be ∼4 mV) or for the voltage drop across the remaining uncompensated series resistance (at most 1.5 megaohms). Experiments were done at room temperature. Data were acquired with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 10 kHz, and digitized at 50 kHz with a 16 bit A/D converter (InstruTech ITC-16; InstruTech, Port Washington, NY) under the control of pulse acquisition software (HEKA). All traces shown and used for analyses are averaged from at least five recordings. Analyses were performed with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and Microsoft Excel.ABR Measurements—Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. To record electrical potentials, the mouse was placed onto a 37 °C heating pad, and subdermal silver wire electrodes were inserted at the vertex (reference), ventrolateral to the measured ear (active), and at the back of the animal (ground). Electrical signals were then recorded in response to a 25-μs click (broadband) or pip (single frequency) sound stimuli presented to one ear from each mouse. Electrical signals were averaged (from at least 200 repetitions) and were collected from 10 to 100 dB SPL in 5-10-dB steps. Thresholds were defined as the sound pressure level where a stimulus-correlated response was clearly identified in the recorded signal.DPOAE Measurements—Mice were anesthetized as described above. DPOAEs were measured as described previously (30Jimenez A.M. Stagner B.B. Martin G.K. Lonsbury-Martin B.L. Hear. Res. 1999; 138: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The f1 and f2 primary tones were generated by a dual channel synthesizer (Hewlett-Packard 3326A) and attenuated using custom software that operated a digital signal processor on board a personal computer system. The f1 and f2 primaries (f2/f1 = 1.25) were then presented over two separate ear speakers (Radio Shack, Realistic, Dual Radial Horn Tweeters) and delivered to the outer ear canal through an acoustic probe fitted with a soft rubber tip (ER3-34 Infant Silicon Tip; Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL). Ear canal sound pressure levels, measured by an emissions microphone assembly (ER-10B+; Etymotic Research) embedded in the probe, were sampled, synchronously averaged, and processed using a fast Fourier transform for geometric mean (GM) frequencies ((f1 × f2)0.5) ranging from 5.6 to 17.2 kHz (f2 = 6.3-19.2 kHz). Corresponding noise floors (NFs) were computed by averaging the levels of the ear canal sound pressure for five frequency bins above and below the DPOAE frequency bin. For test frequencies above 20 kHz, a computer-controlled dynamic signal analyzer (Hewlett-Packard 3561A) was used. The related NFs were estimated by averaging the levels of the ear canal sound pressure for the two fast Fourier transform frequency bins below the DPOAE frequency. NFs were not found to be significantly different between Slo+/+, Slo+/-, Slo-/- mice or between C57 WT and β1/4-/- mice. Thus, only the group averaged NF is shown. For each genotype, the mean ± S.E. DPOAEs are presented as a function of the GM frequencies. Three GM frequencies (17.1, 18.4, and 19.7 kHz) were not included in the average plots shown due to artifacts related to the 1/4-wave cancellation effect in the mouse ear canal, which result in primary tones being more intense than their targeted levels (30Jimenez A.M. Stagner B.B. Martin G.K. Lonsbury-Martin B.L. Hear. Res. 1999; 138: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—In parallel experiments, total RNA was extracted from either the cochleae or cerebellum from between one and four 8-week-old Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the provided directions. Extracted RNA was further purified and concentrated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini and Micro Kits (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cochleae provided between 1 and 4 μg of total RNA; each halfcerebellum provided ∼10 μg of total RNA. Total RNA yield and purity were assessed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Mountain View, CA). All samples had A260/A280 ratios of 1.9-2.1 and showed two sharp peaks corresponding to the 18 and 28 S RNA on electropherograms. First strand synthesis was performed using either one-cycle or two-cycle cDNA synthesis kits (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).Microarrays—Affymetrix murine genome 430 2.0 GeneChips were processed at the Stanford University Microarray Core Facility. Each microarray contains ∼45,000 probe sets that include known genes, expressed sequence tags, and internal housekeeping and control genes. After target preparation, hybridization, and signal acquisition according to standard Affymetrix protocols (available on the World Wide Web www.affymetrix.com). Data were analyzed as described previously (31Meredith A.L. Wiler S.W. Miller B.H. Takahashi J.S. Fodor A.A. Ruby N.F. Aldrich R.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, data were normalized using dchip (available on the World Wide Web at biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip/) with the default parameters. Hybridization signals for each gene were reported as the median of the 11 perfect match probes in each probe set. To compare differences in the expression of channels and transporters between the cochleae of Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice, transcripts containing the keywords “channels” and “transporters” (ignoring case) in the Annotations in the Mouse430_2.gin file provided by Affymetrix were compared.NIHL Measurements—The octave band noise (OBN) was generated using white noise output by a USB-controlled digital signal processor system (Intelligent Hearing Systems, Miami, FL) connected to an IBM-compatible PC and filtered through a custom-made filter box (Intelligent Hearing Systems) using a four-pole band pass filter with a center frequency of 10 kHz and a bandwidth from 8 to 16 kHz. The signal was then amplified using a Crown D75A and transduced by four speakers (Radio Shack) placed in the walls of the sound chamber. The noise spectrum, analyzed with the dynamic signal analyzer in 1/3-octave frequency bands, ranged from 8 to 15 kHz, with the maximum energy of 105 dB SPL at 10 kHz.During the 1-h OBN exposure, one mouse was placed into each compartment (12 cm wide) of a custom-made, wire mesh cage consisting of four compartments with free access to food. During each free field exposure session, a maximum of four mice, each in an individual compartment, were exposed to the OBN. The wire mesh cage was positioned in the center of the sound isolation chamber, fitted with hard reflecting surfaces that ensure homogeneous exposure levels. The homogeneity of the sound field was confirmed using a Quest sound meter with the microphone placed in various places of the cage.One day after measuring base line ABR and DPOAE responses, mice were exposed to the 105-dB SPL stimulus for 1 h. Threshold shifts (TSs) for each genotype were determined by comparing the differences in the mean ABR and DPOAE responses measured 5 days after recovery with their prenoise-exposed values.Statistics—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the mean. Box plots are shown with the median line, whisker tops, and bottoms indicating the 90th and 10th percentile and box tops and bottoms indicating the 75th and 25th percentile. p values were calculated using a two-tailed paired or unpaired (as appropriate) t test assuming unequal variances.RESULTSInner Hair Cells from Slo-/- Mice Do Not Express the BKα Subunit and Have Normal Morphology and Synaptic Innervation—Immunostaining with antibodies against the BK channel was performed to confirm the absence of the BKα subunit from the IHCs of Slo-/- mice. Fig. 1 shows organs of Corti from 8-week-old Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice double immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against the hair cell marker calretinin (green) and a polyclonal antibody against the BK channel (red). IHCs from Slo+/+ mice show clustered expression of BK channels near the apex of the IHCs, as has been previously reported (17Hafidi A. Beurg M. Dulon D. Neuroscience. 2005; 130: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Pyott S.J. Glowatzki E. Trimmer J.S. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression is observed when staining with either the polyclonal (green) or monoclonal antibody (red) against the BK channel (each recognizing distinct epitopes of the BKα subunit). In contrast, IHCs from Slo-/- mice show no staining for BK channels in IHCs with either the polyclonal or monoclonal antibody. These data confirm the specificity of both the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for the BKα subunit and, more importantly, verify the absence of the BKα subunit from the IHCs from Slo-/- mice.Because mice with hearing deficits arising from the genetic deletion of ion channels can show hair cell degeneration (32Lee M.P.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10832-10840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), organs of Corti excised from 8-week-old Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice were immunostained to assess the morphology and synaptic architecture of the IHCs (Fig. 2). Immunostaining with either a polyclonal or monoclonal (data not shown) antibody against calretinin, an endogenous calcium buffer enriched in the sensory hair cells (36Zheng J.L. Gao W.Q. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8270-8282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shows that the IHCs from Slo-/- mice are intact and normally arranged compared with those from Slo+/+ mice. To assess the afferent innervation to the IHCs, organs of Corti were immunostained with an antibody against NF200, a known marker of afferent fibers in the organ of Corti (37Berglund A.M. Ryugo D.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 306: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). No gross differences in the arrangement or density of the afferent nerve fibers to the IHCs were observed between Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice across replicates (Fig. 2). Efferent innervation was assessed by staining for synapsin, a synaptic vesicle marker expressed only in the conventional (nonribbon) efferent synapses of the organ of Corti (38Von Kriegstein K.

Synapsin staining revealed no consistent differences in the arrangement or density of the efferent innervation of the OHCs and IHC afferent terminals between Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice across replicates (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Inner hair cells from Slo-/- mice have normal morphology and synaptic innervation. Intact organs of Corti from 8-week-old Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice were immunostained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The morphology of the IHCs and their synaptic innervation was assessed by immunostaining with antibodies against the hair cell marker calretinin, the afferent fiber marker NF200, and the efferent presynapse marker synapsin. Immunostaining with a monoclonal calretinin antibody reveals similar morphology of the IHCs from both Slo+/+ and Slo-/- mice.

The vertebrate C-P4Hs I, II, and III are [α(I)]<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>, [α(II)]<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>, and [α(III)]<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> tetramers with identical β subunits. We generated mice with targeted inactivation of the <i>P4ha1</i> gene encoding the catalytic α subunit of C-P4H I to analyze its specific functions. The null mice died after E10.5, showing an overall developmental delay and a dilated endoplasmic reticulum in their cells. The capillary walls were frequently ruptured, but the capillary density remained unchanged. The C-P4H activity level in the null embryos and fibroblasts cultured from them was 20% of that in the wild type, being evidently due to the other two isoenzymes. Collagen IV immunofluorescence was almost absent in the basement membranes of the null embryos, and electron microscopy revealed disrupted basement membranes, while immunoelectron microscopy showed a lack of collagen IV in them. The amount of soluble collagen IV was increased in the null embryos and cultured null fibroblasts, indicating a lack of assembly of collagen IV molecules into insoluble structures, probably due to their underhydroxylation and hence abnormal conformation. In contrast, the null embryos had collagen I and III fibrils with a typical cross-striation pattern but slightly increased diameters, and the null fibroblasts secreted fibril-forming collagens, although less efficiently than wild-type cells. The primary cause of death of the null embryos was thus most likely an abnormal assembly of collagen IV."
https://openalex.org/W1967293715,"Leukemic transformation often requires activation of protein kinase B (PKB/c-Akt) and is characterized by increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and a differentiation block. PKB phosphorylates and inactivates members of the FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors. It has been suggested that hyperactivation of PKB maintains the leukemic phenotype through actively repressing FOXO-mediated regulation of specific genes. We have found expression of the transcriptional repressor Id1 (inhibitor of DNA binding 1) to be abrogated by FOXO3a activation. Inhibition of PKB activation or growth factor deprivation also resulted in strong down-regulation of Id1 promoter activity, Id1 mRNA, and protein expression. Id1 is highly expressed in Bcr-Abl-transformed K562 cells, correlating with high PKB activation and FOXO3a phosphorylation. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl by the chemical inhibitor STI571 resulted in activation of FOXO3a and down-regulation of Id1 expression. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and promoter-mutation analysis, we demonstrate that FOXO3a acts as a transcriptional repressor by directly binding to the Id1 promoter. STI571 treatment, or expression of constitutively active FOXO3a, resulted in erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, which was inhibited by ectopic expression of Id1.

The bcr-abl fusion gene is known to be essential to the pathogenesis of CML, and the Bcr-Abl protein demonstrates constitutively active kinase activity, which is essential and sufficient for malignant transformation (9Deininger M.W.

Bcr-Abl exerts diverse actions on hematopoietic cells in terms of cellular transforming activity, inhibition of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, altered cell migration, and adhesion to extracellular matrix (9Deininger M.W.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8605-8611Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression of Bcr-Abl results in growth factor independence of cells and activates multiple signaling cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/c-Akt) signaling pathway (15Steelman L.S.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In non-malignant cells activation of the PI3K/PKB-signaling module is stimulated by growth factors and cytokines and has been linked to regulation of cellular proliferation and survival in a diverse variety of cell systems (17Datta S.R.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the members of the FOXO subfamily of transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4 are directly phosphorylated by PKB (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

Anat. 2000; 197: 571-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of growth or survival factors FOXOs are unphosphorylated, localized in the nucleus, and transcriptionally active. Upon stimulation with growth factors or cytokines, PKB activity is induced, and it translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates FOXOs, leading to inhibition of transcriptional activity and nuclear export (22Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated that FOXO transcription factors can regulate a variety of genes that influence cellular proliferation (e.g. p27Kip1 and cyclin D), survival (e.g. FasL and Bim), metabolism (e.g. PEPCK and glucose-6phosphatase), and responses to stress (e.g. MnSOD and catalase) (21Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Anat. 2000; 197: 571-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Myeloid leukemic cells are characterized not only by uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, but also by a block in differentiation (7Lowenberg B. Downing J.R. Burnett A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 10Bennett J.M. Catovsky D. Daniel M.T. Flandrin G. Galton D.A. Gralnick H.R. Sultan C. Br. J. Haematol. 1976; 33: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). Because the PI3K/PKB pathway is constitutively activated in leukemic cells (23Kharas M.G. Fruman D.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2047-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Birkenkamp K.U. Geugien M. Schepers H. Westra J. Lemmink H.H. Vellenga E. Leukemia. 2004; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), this suggests that hyperactivation of the PI3K/PKB pathway maintains the leukemic phenotype not only by regulating proliferation and apoptosis but also by actively repressing a set of genes regulating hematopoiesis. Importantly, PI3K signaling is crucial for transformation of Bcr-Abl. Skorski et al. (25Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K downstream signaling by ectopic expression of dominant-negative PKB inhibited Bcr-Abl-dependent transformation of murine bone marrow cells in vitro and suppressed leukemia development in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice. In addition, recently it has been shown that FOXO3a was constitutively phosphorylated and therefore inactive in cell lines expressing Bcr-Abl (26Komatsu N. Watanabe T. Uchida M. Mori M. Kirito K.

Signoretti S. Loda M. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39223-39230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This suggests that inhibition of FOXO3a transcriptional activity may be required to maintain the leukemic phenotype. Therefore, we looked for novel target genes of FOXO3a that might indeed play a role in regulating hematopoiesis. To identify novel transcriptional target genes of the FOXO transcription factor FOXO3a, cDNA microarray analysis was performed using a bone marrow-derived cell line stably expressing an inducible active FOXO3a mutant. We found the transcriptional repressor Id1 (inhibitor of differentiation) (28Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be a direct transcriptional target of FOXO3a. Here we show that the transcriptional down-regulation of Id1 by FOXO3a is required for the induction of differentiation of leukemic cells. We show that expression of a constitutively active FOXO3a mutant induced differentiation of Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. Conversely, constitutive expression of Id1 inhibited differentiation. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the high expression of Id1, through a PI3K/PKB-mediated inhibition of FOXO3a, is critical for maintaining the leukemic phenotype. Cell Culture—Ba/F3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 8% HyClone serum (Invitrogen) and recombinant mouse IL-3 produced in COS cells (29Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). BaF3-FOXO3a(A3):ER* cells were previously described (29Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For the generation of clonal Ba/F3 cells stably expressing FOXO3a(A3):ER*, the pcDNA3-FOXO3a(A3):ER* construct was electroporated into Ba/F3 cells and maintained in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Clonal cell lines were generated by limited dilution. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 8% HyClone serum (Invitrogen). COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For cytokine withdrawal experiments, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in AimV medium. For the generation of clonal K562 cells stably expressing FOXO3a(A3):ER*, 10 μg of pBabe-puromycin-FOXO3a(A3)ER vector or empty vector was electroporated into K562 cells at 0.35 V and 950 microfarads using a Bio-Rad GenePulser. Cells were selected and maintained in the presence of 1 μg/ml Puromycin (InvivoGen, UK), and clonal cell lines were generated. Single cell clones were obtained with serial dilution and tested by Western blotting after addition of 200 nm tamoxifen (Sigma) at 5 × 105 cells/ml for 24 h (Invitrogen). Transfection of psiRNA-h7Skzeo:FOXO3a into K562—To obtain stable cells lines, the mammalian expression vector psiRNA-h7Skzeo (InvivoGen) was used for gene silencing of FOXO3a in K562 cells. The psiRNA plasmid (InvivoGen) is specifically designed for the cloning of small synthetic oligonucleotides that encode two complementary sequences of 19 nucleotides, separated by the used hairpin sequence: TCACTGCATAGTCGATTCA. The cells were split 24 h prior to the transfection and were ∼0.8 to 1 × 106 cells/ml. 10 μg of the construct was transiently transfected into K562 cells by electroporation using the BioRad GenePulser (950 microfarads and 0.350 kV). The transfected cells were carefully resuspended in conditioned medium and left to grow overnight. 24 h post transfection, cells were checked and carefully washed, and then selection was started according to the siRNA manufacturer recommendation. During the first week, the cells were selected in growth medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml Zeocin, followed by single cell cloning and expansion for another 2 weeks. The cells were tested for the efficiency of siRNA silencing by Western blotting. Antibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal antibodies against PKB and phospho-Ser-473 PKB were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Hitchin, UK). Anti-p27Kip1 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies against Id1 and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Total and Phospho-Thr-32 FOXO3a were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). STI571 was a kind gift from Dr. S. Ebeling (Dept. Hematology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands). The pLZRS-FOXO3a(A3) construct was generated as follows. First, the Xba/HindIII FOXO3a(A3) fragment from the pECE-FOXO3a(A3) vector was ligated into Xba/HindIII, cut and dephosphorylated pBluescript. Subsequently, pLZRS-FOXO3a(A3) was created by ligating a Xho/NotI fragment from pBluescript into Xho/NotI cut pLZRS. The pGL3-Id1 promoter construct was obtained by amplifying a 1692-bp fragment of the Id1 promoter from human chromosomal DNA, which was ligated into pGL3 (pGL3-basic from Promega) cut with SmaI and XhoI. The FOXO3a binding site 1 was mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with primer 5′-GGGGGCCGTGGCGTGCGTATAAAAGACAAGC-3′ and its complementary sequence. Viral Transduction—A bicistronic retroviral DNA construct was utilized, expressing Id1 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Spits, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and an internal ribosomal entry site followed by the gene encoding eGFP (30Buitenhuis M. van Deutekom H.W. Verhagen L.P. Castor A. Jacobsen S.E. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Retrovirus was produced by transient transfection of 293T cells by FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science). 0.6 × 106 cells were seeded in 9-cm dishes. The following day, 20 min before transfection the medium of the cells was refreshed. 12 μl of FuGENE-6, 2 μgof pCL-ampho, and 2 μg of pLZRS-eGFP, pLZRS-Id1, or pLZRS-FOXO3a(A3) were added to 184 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and subsequently added to the cells. Again after 24 h the medium was replaced with RRMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 8% HyClone). After again 24 h later the viral supernatants were collected, filtered through a 0.22-μm Acrodisc filter, and stored at –80 °C. Before transduction K562 cells were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. The next day K562 cells were transduced by resuspending 106 cells in 0.5 ml of RPMI. After addition of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 ml of viral supernatant, the cells were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 1.5 h at room temperature. After 24 h the cells were washed once and transduced for a second time. Two days after transduction, eGFP-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and treated with or without STI571. Western Blotting—For the detection of Id1, p27, phospho-PKB, and phospho-FOXO3a, cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer, and the protein concentration was determined. Equal amounts of each protein sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with the respective antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Assays—For transient transfections Ba/F3 cells were electroporated (0.28 kV, capacitance 950 microfarads) with 16 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the Id1 promoter. Cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of a Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega, Madison, WI) to normalize for transfection efficiency. After transfection cells were cultured with or without IL-3 or in the presence of IL-3 with or without 4-hydroxytamoxifen (100 nm) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in commercially available luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined as in a previous study (29Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W.

COS cells were transiently transfected with the pGL3-Id1 luciferase promoter construct, together with pECE-FOXO3a(A3) (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J.

Values were corrected for transfection efficiency and represent the mean of at least three independent experiments (± S.E.). RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Cells were stimulated as indicated and at the respective times harvested. 5 × 106 cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and stored at –20 °C. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and cDNA was generated as previously described (31Oudijk E.J. Nijhuis E.H. Zwank M.D. van de Graaf E.A. Mager H.J. Coffer P.J. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Thorax. 2005; 60: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 10 μg of RNA was treated with DNase according to the manufacturer's protocol (DNAfree, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers. Samples containing 1 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 12.5 μl were heated for 3 min at 65 °C and quickly chilled on ice. A mixture of 12.5 μl containing 20 μg/ml oligo(dT) primers, 2.5 μl5× iScript Reaction Mix (BioRad), 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm dNTPs, 0.8 unit/μl of RNase inhibitor, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was added. The total mixture was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase for 10 min at 65 °C. cDNA was stored at –20 °C before further use. All reagents used for cDNA synthesis were obtained from Invitrogen. Real-time PCR—Id1, β-actin, and GAPDH mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR using SYBR green I (Nieuwekerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands). Primers were designed using Primer 3 software from the Whitehead Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genome Research (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi). For mouse Id1 a 86-bp fragment was amplified using the FW primer 5′-ACGACATGAACGGCTGCTAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CAGGATCTCCACCTTGCTCAC-3′. For human Id1 a 68-bp fragment was amplified using the FW primer 5′-CTGGACGAGCAGCAGGTAAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGCTCCTTGAGGCGTGAGTAA-3′. For mouse GAPDH as a control a 191-bp fragment was amplified using the FW primer 5′-AACGACCCCTTCATTGAC-3′ and RV primer 5′-TCCACGACATACTCAGCAC-3′ were used. For human GAPDH a 135-bp fragment was amplified using the FW primer 5′-AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT-3′ and RV primer 5′-GAGGCATTGCTGATGATCTTG-3′, and a 174-bp fragment of β-actin was amplified using FW primer 5′-AGCCTCGCCTTTGCCGA-3′ and RV primer 5′-CTGGTGCCTGGGGCG-3′ (32Kreuzer K.A.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—K562 cells cultured at 106 cells/ml were either untreated or stimulated with 5 μm STI571 for 4 or 8 h, and then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described by Fernandez de Mattos et al. (33Fernandez de M.S. Essafi A. Soeiro I. Pietersen A.M. Birkenkamp K.U. Edwards C.S. Martino A. Nelson B.H. Francis J.M. Jones M.C. Brosens J.J. Coffer P.J. Lam E.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10058-10071Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were formaldehyde-cross-linked and immunoprecipitated with either the FOXO3a (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or an isotype control antibody (BabCO). PCRs were then performed on the purified DNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol, in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2, at 55 °C, for 28 cycles, using the FOXO3a primers sense (Primer1: 5′-CAGAGGAGCCCAGTGCGG; Primer2: 5′-CAGCCCCAAACTTACTAGACTTTCC; and Primer3: 5′-CAGGCGAACGCTACCATGC); antisense (Primer1: 5′-AAGTGGAAGCCCGAAGCA; Primer2: 5′-TCTCACTTCTCCAGCTCCATTT; and Primer3: 5′-CCTAATATTTAATATCTGCTTGGTGTTTAA). Analysis of the PCR products was performed on a standard 2% (w/v) agarose gel, by electrophoresis in Tris acetate EDTA buffer. Measurement of Hemoglobin Expression—The benzidine oxidation test was performed as described (34Kaiho S. Mizuno K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In short, cells (0.2–3 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with STI571 for 24, 48, or 72 h, then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline at low speeds for 10 min, and finally resuspended in 0.9% NaCl-benzidine reagent solution (to 1 ml of 0.2% tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) in 0.5 m acetic acid, 20 ml of 30% H2O2 was added just prior to use), which was added to start the reaction. After incubation for 30 min in darkness at room temperature, 200 cells were counted in a Burker chamber. The number of cells containing blue crystals indicative of oxidized tetramethylbenzidine and reflecting hemoglobin production was determined. Extraction of DNA-binding Proteins—Briefly, 25 × 106 cells were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 400 μl of cold low salt buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) by gently flicking the tube. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min. After a brief vortex, samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in 30–40 μl of cold high salt buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% v/v glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). The supernatant fraction contains the DNA-binding proteins. Protein yield was quantified by using a Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotide “Pull-down” Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells using the high salt buffer as described. After diluting with 2 volumes of low salt lysis buffer, 50 μg of the cell extracts was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with either 0.5 nmol of the 5′-biotinylated double-stranded wild-type (5′-TGGCGTGTTTATAAAAGACAAGCTGTGGCT-3′) or mutant (5′-TGGCGAATTCATAAAGGGCCCGCTGTGGCT-3′) oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) previously coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma). All the pull-down experiments were performed with exactly equal aliquots from the same sample of either untreated or STI571-treated nuclear extracts. The wild-type oligonucleotide corresponded to the region of –114 to –144 of the human Id1 promoter. After incubation, the biotinylated oligonucleotide-coupled streptavidin beads were washed at least six times with low salt buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and denatured in SDS-sample buffer before being run on an SDS-acrylamide gel. The separated proteins were then Western-blotted for FOXO3a using specific antibodies. For competition experiments, the extracts were incubated with the wild-type oligonucleotide-coupled beads in the presence of 1×, 5×, or 50× molar excess of either the wild-type or mutant non-biotinylated oligonucleotide. Identification of Id1 as a Novel Transcriptional Target of FOXO3a—We and others have found that enforced expression of FOXO activity can induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the cell type (22Birkenkamp K.U.

To identify novel transcriptional targets of FOXO3a that might be involved in hematopoiesis, we made use of a bone marrow-derived cell line (Ba/F3 cells) stably expressing an inducible form of active FOXO3a, in which all three PKB-phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine, FOXO3a(A3):ER* (29Dijkers P.F.

It is also noteworthy that neurotoxicities induced by soluble Aβ assemblies are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of signal transduction pathways, including those involving Src family kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or sphingomyelinases (7Lambert M.P.

Furthermore, the inhibition of long term potentiation and the impairment of cognitive function in vivo can be induced by natural Aβ oligomers (9Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R.

Additionally, recent studies using AD mouse models revealed that soluble Aβ assemblies may play a role in the induction of tau pathology (26Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tran L. Lambert M.P. Glabe C.G. Klein W.L. LaFerla F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1599-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and that the genetic deletion of β-secretase, which is responsible for Aβ production, rescues temporal memory deficit in conjunction with the suppression of the increase in the levels of cerebral Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (27Ohno M.

These lines of evidence indicate the pathological relevance of these soluble Aβ assemblies in AD development. However, it remains to be elucidated how these assemblies are formed in vivo. Several mutations within the Aβ sequence have been reported to be responsible for the development of familial AD and hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (28Levy E. Carman M.D. Fernandez-Madrid I.J. Power M.D. Lieberburg I. van Duinen S.G. Bots G.T. Luyendijk W. Frangione B.

Neurol. 2001; 49: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Among these mutations, the Arctic mutation, unlike other mutations, accelerates the development of clinical and neuropathological features indistinguishable from those of sporadic AD, although it does not increase Aβ42 level or Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (30Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Naslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The pathological features induced by the Arctic mutation, including predominant Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma, have also been confirmed in transgenic mice (33Cheng I.H. Palop J.J. Esposito L.A. Bien-Ly N. Yan F. Mucke L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1190-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Notably, Aβ bearing the Arctic mutation shows a propensity to form neurotoxic nonamyloid assemblies, including protofibrils, amyloid pores, and small nonfibrillar assemblies (13Whalen B.M. Selkoe D.J. Hartley D.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C.

Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Thus, researchers have focused on the Arctic mutation in terms of the mechanisms underlying the formation of soluble and insoluble Aβ assemblies. In regard to the assembly of wild-type and hereditary variant-type Aβs, we have recently observed that Arctic-type Aβ, unlike other hereditary variant-type Aβs(i.e. Dutch-type, Italian-type, and Flemish-type Aβs), preferably assembles in the presence of GM1 ganglioside, as does wild-type Aβ (35Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 36Yamamoto N. Hasegawa K. Matsuzaki K. Naiki H. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also reported that GM1 ganglioside level increases in synaptosomes prepared from aged, human apolipoprotein E4 knock-in mice (37Yamamoto N. Igbabvoa U. Shimada Y. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Kobayashi M. Wood W.G. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that an alteration in the expression or distribution of GM1 ganglioside is the background to the assembly and deposition of Aβ in the brain parenchyma. This possibility has been supported by findings of recent studies as follows: 1) GM1 ganglioside level increases in membrane microdomains isolated from the frontal cortex but not from the temporal cortex, reflecting earlier and later stages of AD pathology, respectively (38Molander-Melin M. Blennow K. Bogdanovic N. Dellheden B. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and 2) GM1 ganglioside level also increases in amyloid-positive nerve terminals obtained from the AD cortex (39Gylys K.H. Fein J.A. Yang F. Miller C.A. Cole G.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2007; 28: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to characterize the toxicity of assemblies formed from Arctic-type Aβ in the presence of GM1 ganglioside. We found that a toxic soluble Aβ assembly (TAβ) is formed more rapidly and to a greater extent from Arctic-type Aβ in the presence of GM1 ganglioside than from wild-type Aβ. Furthermore, our results suggest that TAβ induces nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor-mediated neuronal death. Thus, we propose that soluble Aβ assemblies, such as TAβ, are responsible for plaque-independent neuronal death that favorably occurs in NGF-dependent neurons in AD. Preparation of Seed-free Aβ Solutions and Liposomes—Synthetic wild-type Aβ (Aβ40) and Arctic-type Aβ (Aβ40) (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) were dissolved in 0.02% ammonia solution at 500 μm. To obtain seed-free Aβ solutions, the prepared solutions were centrifuged at 540,000 × g for 3 h using an Optima TL ultracentrifuge (Beckman) to remove undissolved peptides that can act as preexisting seeds. The supernatant was collected and stored in aliquots at -80 °C until use. Immediately before use, the aliquots were thawed and diluted with Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). To prepare liposomes, cholesterol (Sigma), sphingomyelin (Sigma), and GM1 ganglioside (Matreya LLC) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol at a molar lipid ratio of 50:50:0, 45:45:10, 42.5:42.5:15, or 40:40:20. The mixtures were stored at -80 °C until use. Immediately before use, the lipids were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline at a ganglioside concentration of 2.5 mm, and the suspension was subjected to freezing and thawing and sonication. Cell Culture—Cerebral cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in a serum-free medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture and N2 supplement. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 (PC12) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen) and 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For their differentiation, PC12 cells were plated on 2-cm2 poly-l-lysine-coated (10 mg/ml) dishes at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 and cultured for 6 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml NGF (PC12N) (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (SY5Y) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the cells were cultured in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Aβ Incubation in the Presence of GM1 Ganglioside—A seed-free Aβ solution was incubated at 37 °C and 50 μm, unless otherwise indicated, in the presence or absence of GM1 ganglioside-containing liposomes, as previously reported (40Hayashi H. Kimura N. Yamaguchi H. Hasegawa K. Yokoseki T. Shibata M. Yamamoto N. Michikawa M. Yoshikawa Y. Terao K. Matsuzaki K. Lemere C.A. Selkoe D.J. Naiki H. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The concentration of GM1 ganglioside in the incubation mixtures was 500 μm, and the molar ratio of GM1 ganglioside in the liposomes varied, as indicated in each figure. ThT Assay—Aβ solutions were incubated in the presence of liposomes at 50 μm and 37 °C for various durations. The ThT fluorescence intensity of the incubation mixtures was determined using a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5300PC) (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). The optimum fluorescence intensity of amyloid fibrils was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 446 and 490 nm, respectively, with the reaction mixture (1.0 ml) containing 5 μm ThT and 50 mm glycine-NaOH at pH 8.5. The fluorescence intensity was measured immediately after preparing the mixture. LDH Release Assay—The LDH assay was performed on medium using an LDH assay toxicity kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The degree of LDH release in each sample was assessed by measuring absorbance at 490 nm using an Emax precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Background absorbances, as assessed using cell-free wells, were subtracted from the absorbances of each test sample. Absorbances measured from three wells were averaged, and the percentage degree of LDH release was calculated by dividing the absorbance measured from each test sample following treatment with 1% Triton X-100 to induce the release of intracellular LDH according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Electron and Atomic Force Microscopies—For electron microscopy, the samples were diluted with distilled water and spread onto carbon-coated grids. The grids were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate and examined under a JEM-2000EX transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) assessment was performed as described elsewhere (41Maeda S. Sahara N. Saito Y. Murayama S. Ikai A. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 54: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were dropped onto a freshly cleaved mica. After leaving them to stand for 3 min and then washing with water, the samples were assessed in a solution using a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) set in the tapping mode (42Hansma H.G. Laney D.E. Bezanilla M. Sinsheimer R.L. Hansma P.K. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1672-1677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). OMCL-TR400PSA (Olympus, Japan) was used as a cantilever. The resonant frequency was ∼9 kHz. Size Exclusion Chromatography—The molecular mass of TAβ was determined using a Superose 12 size exclusion column (1 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Thirty-five fractions were collected and analyzed by dot blotting using anti-Oligo. Preparation of Synaptosomes—Synaptosomes were prepared as previously described (43Schroeder F. Morrison W.J. Gorka C. Wood W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A hippocampus or a whole brain minus the hippocampus was homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose buffer containing 0.25 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 580 × g for 8 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 145,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was suspended in 0.32 m sucrose buffer without EDTA and layered over Ficoll in sucrose buffer. Following centrifugation at 87,000 × g for 30 min, the synaptosome-rich interface was removed and recentrifuged to remove any remaining Ficoll. RNA Interference—Stealth™ small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex oligoribonucleotides against PC12 cell TrkA (GenBank™ number NM_021589) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) (GenBank™ number NM_012610) were synthesized by Invitrogen. The siRNA sequences used were as follows: rTrkA-siRNA (position 1370) sense (5′-GCCCUCCUCCUAGUGCUCAACAAAU-3′) and antisense (5′-AUUUGUUGAGCACUAGGAGGAGGGC-3′); rTrkA-siRNA-control sense (5′-GCCCUCCGAUCUCGUCAACAUCAAU-3′) and antisense (5′-AUUGAUGUUGACGAGAUCGGAGGGC-3′); rp75-siRNA (position 1212) sense (5′-CAGCCUGAACAUAUAGACUCCUUUA-3′) and antisense (5′-UAAAGGAGUCUUAUAUGUUCAGGCUG-3′); rp75-siRNA-control sense (5′-CAGGUAAACAUAUAGUCCCUCCUUA-3′) and antisense (5′-UAAGGAGGGACUAUAUGUUUACCUG-3′). The control siRNA had a random sequence. siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected into PC12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Toxicity of Aβ Assembly Formed from Arctic-type Aβ—We treated primary neurons with seed-free wild- or Arctic-type Aβ, which had been preincubated for 2 h in the absence or presence of GM1 ganglioside (10 or 20% molar ratio in the lipids composing liposomes). Unexpectedly, extensive neuronal death was observed in the culture treated with Arctic-type Aβ, which had been preincubated for 2 h in the presence of GM1 ganglioside at a 10% molar ratio in liposomes (Fig. 1A). The extent of neuronal death under this condition was greater than that under any other conditions examined in this study (Fig. 1, A and B). To quantitatively characterize the toxic Aβ assembly, we examined its toxicity against NGF-treated PC12 cells (PC12N cells). We found that PC12N cells are also sensitive to the toxic Aβ assembly formed from Arctic-type Aβ (Fig. 1C). We performed an LDH release assay of cultures of PC12N cells under various conditions. The level of LDH released from the PC12N cells, which were treated with the toxic Aβ assembly, increased depending on Aβ dose (Fig. 1D), GM1 ganglioside dose (Fig. 1E), and the duration of the exposure of the cells to the toxic Aβ assembly (Fig. 1F). In regard to the time course of Aβ preincubation with GM1 ganglioside, the level of released LDH increased with peak value at 2 h and then decreased in conjunction with an increase in the ThT fluorescence intensity of the incubation mixtures (Fig. 1G). The Toxic Aβ Assembly Is Soluble—Importantly, the toxicity of the Aβ incubated in the presence of GM1 ganglioside was observed exclusively in the supernatant obtained by ultracentrifuging the incubation mixture (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the toxic Aβ assembly is soluble. To examine the possibility that a TAβ is formed in the presence GM1 ganglioside, we performed dot blotting using an oligomer-specific antibody (anti-Oligo) (23Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). TAβ in the incubation mixtures was readily recognized by anti-Oligo (Fig. 2B). The specificity of TAβ recognition by anti-Oligo was confirmed by the finding that TAβ toxicity was significantly neutralized by coincubating the mixtures with anti-Oligo in the cultures of PC12N cells and primary neurons (Fig. 2C). However, coincubation with a monoclonal antibody (4396C), which inhibits Aβ fibrillogenesis through binding to GM1 ganglioside-bound Aβ as a seed (40Hayashi H. Kimura N. Yamaguchi H. Hasegawa K. Yokoseki T. Shibata M. Yamamoto N. Michikawa M. Yoshikawa Y. Terao K. Matsuzaki K. Lemere C.A. Selkoe D.J. Naiki H. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit the induction of TAβ toxicity (Fig. 2D). TAβ Formation from Wild-type Aβ—We then examined whether TAβ is also formed from wild-type Aβ (Aβ40). We first investigated how TAβ is formed from wild-type Aβ in the presence of liposomes containing GM1 ganglioside. Interestingly, TAβ is favorably formed from wild-type Aβ in the presence of GM1 ganglioside at a 15% molar ratio in liposomes (Fig. 3A). TAβ toxicity was not significant in the nanomolar range of Aβ (Fig. 3B). Biophysical and Structural Features of TAβ—To determine the biophysical and structural features of TAβ, we performed SDS-PAGE of the incubation mixtures containing TAβ. However, no high molecular weight bands corresponding to possible Aβ assemblies were detected. Bands were observed only after cross-linking pretreatment with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 4A), consistent with previous findings showing that soluble Aβ assemblies are probably degraded by denaturing gel electrophoresis (6Walsh D.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A morphological analysis of TAβ by electron microscopy failed to detect any definite structure under conditions in which protofibrils, which had been prepared as previously reported (30Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Naslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), were readily detectable (Fig. 4B). In contrast, spherical particles with diameters of 10–20 nm, along with rod-shaped structures, were observed by AFM in the supernatant obtained by ultracentrifuging the incubation mixtures containing TAβ (Fig. 4C). We then determined the molecular mass of TAβ by size exclusion chromatography, which was followed by dot blotting using anti-Oligo. The immunoreactivity was recovered as a single peak with relative molecular masses of 200–300 kDa (Fig. 4D). The recovery of TAβ immunoreactivity in the same fraction was also observed in the incubation mixture containing wild-type Aβ (Aβ40) and GM1 ganglioside at a 15% molar ratio in liposomes (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the collected peak showed a significant toxicity against PC12N cells (Fig. 4E). TAβ Formation in the Presence of Natural Neuronal Membranes—Next, we tested whether TAβ can be formed in the presence of natural neuronal membranes. We incubated Arctic-type Aβ in the presence of synaptosomes prepared from brains of mice from three different age groups. The degree of TAβ formation was significantly higher in the incubation mixture containing synaptosomes prepared from the hippocampus of aged (2-year-old) mouse brains than in any other incubation mixtures, including those containing synaptosomes from the hippocampus or the whole brain minus the hippocampus from younger (1-month-old and 1-year-old) mouse brains (Fig. 5A). To determine the possibility that an alteration in the lipid composition of neuronal membranes, particularly GM1 ganglioside, underlies the acceleration of TAβ formation, we determined the levels of GM1 ganglioside, cholesterol, and phospholipids in synaptosomes prepared from hippocampi of young (1-month-old) and aged (2-year-old) mouse brains. Notably, the GM1 ganglioside level significantly increased, whereas cholesterol level significantly decreased with age (Fig. 5B). Putative Mechanism Underlying TAβ-induced Neuronal Death—To characterize cell death induced by TAβ, we performed nuclear staining with a membrane-permeable dye, Hoechst 33258. PC12N cells, which were treated with incubation mixtures containing TAβ for 12 h, showed characteristics of apoptotic changes, including retracted neurites, shrunken cell bodies, and the condensation and fragmentation of nuclei in conjunction with an increase in the level of LDH released from TAβ-treated PC12N cells (data not shown). To determine if TAβ toxicity is mediated by NGF receptors, we first treated PC12N cells, native PC12 cells, and primary neurons with TAβ in the presence of exogenous NGF. In these cultures, cell death was markedly prevented (Fig. 6). We then knocked down the NGF receptors, including Trk"

In this study, we show that wortmannin also strongly inhibits Polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3). To further characterize this inhibition, we identified the sites of labeling on Plk1 and Plk3 targeted by AX7503, a tetramethylrhodamine-wortmannin conjugate. AX7503 labeling on Plk1 and Plk3 was found to occur on a conserved ATP binding site residue. In addition, we show that wortmannin inhibits Plk3 activity in live cells at concentrations commonly used to inhibit the more well known targets of wortmannin, the phosphoinositide 3-kinases. Importantly, we found that inhibition of Plk3 by wortmannin lead to a decrease in phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 induced by DNA damage, demonstrating the effect of wortmannin on a downstream Plk3 target. Taken together, our results suggest that wortmannin can affect multiple functions of Plk3 in cell cycle progression and at the DNA damage check point. The identification of the labeling sites of Plk1 and Plk3 by AX7503 may be useful in designing more effective compounds to target Polo-like kinases for cancer treatment and also may be useful for the structural study of Plk domains.

Polo-like kinases (Plks) 4The abbreviations used are: Plk, Polo-like kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; PI, phosphoinositide; PIKK, PI 3-kinase-related kinase; LC, liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. are a conserved family of serinethreonine protein kinases that play many important roles during multiple stages of the cell cycle, especially in mitosis (1Barr F.A.

Subsequent studies showed that this protein is functionally conserved and involved in the regulation of mitosis (19Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Plk3 functions differently from Plk1 in human cells in terms of its regulation during the cell cycle and response to stimulation by growth factors and stresses (18Li B. Ouyang B.

The levels of Plk3 protein remain relatively constant during the cell cycle, and its kinase activity peaks during late S and G2 phases (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Plk3 or its mutants perturbs microtubule integrity, resulting in dramatic morphological changes, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6826-6831PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that has been used widely as a potent, selective, and cell-permeable inhibitor of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases (24Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 25Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a Medline search of “wortmannin and PI 3-kinase” results in thousands of references. We previously reported that wortmannin potently inhibits Plk1 in addition to the PI 3-kinase superfamily (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unlike Polo-like kinases, which phosphorylate proteins, PI 3-kinases are lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-hydroxyl position of the inositol head group of member phosphoinositides. PI 3-kinases and Polo-like kinases do not bear significant sequence similarity other than the basic requirements for being kinases. Therefore, it was surprising to find that wortmannin, in addition to inhibiting PI 3-kinases, is a potent inhibitor of Plk1. Here, we show that wortmannin is also a potent inhibitor of Plk3. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods (27Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem.

AX7503 labeling on Plk1 and Plk3 was found to occur on a conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding site. Additionally, we show that wortmannin inhibits Plk3 activity in an in vitro kinase assay and when incubated with intact cells. Importantly, we found that inhibition of Plk3 by wortmannin lead to a decrease in the Plk3-mediated downstream phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 induced by DNA damage checkpoint.

Cell Culture—HeLa, Jurkat, and A549 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The GM00637 cell line (human fibroblast) was originally obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. Cells were cultured in dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 μg/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) with 5% CO2. Jurkat cells were cultured in dishes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with 5% CO2. To obtain G2/M-arrested cells, Jurkat cells were treated with 3 mm hydroxyurea for 15 h as described previously (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem.

Transfection and Cell Treatment—HeLa and GM00637 cells were transfected with plasmid constructs for 16 h using the Lipofectamine method. HeLa cells were transfected with pCR259-Plk3-A, pCR259-Plk3K91R, or the empty vector, and GM00637 cells were transfected with pCR259-Plk3-A or the empty vector (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K.

The transfected GM00637 cells were first treated with or without 1 μm wortmannin for 30 min and then exposed to 0 or 0.5 mm H2O2 for 60 min.

The whole cell lysate was subjected to centrifugation and the supernatant was collected. The G2/M-arrested Jurkat cells were collected and lysed as described previously (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Labeling and Detection of Plk3 with AX7503—Cell lysates from HeLa cells transfected with empty vector, a wild-type Plk3 construct, and the mutant K91R Plk3 construct were adjusted to 1.5 mg/ml and then treated with AX7503 (75 nm) for 60 min. For labeling of recombinant Plk3, 1 μl (500 units/mg) of recombinant Plk3 was first mixed with 19 μl of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 400 nm β-glycerol phosphate, 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 500 mm sodium sulfate. The recombinant Plk3 was preincubated with or without wortmannin (0.5 μm) for 10 min and then treated with AX7503 (75 nm) for 60 min at room temperature. Reactions were quenched with 1 volume of standard 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (reducing) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins labeled with AX7503 were visualized in-gel with a flatbed laser scanner (Hitachi FM BioII). Polo-like Kinase 3 Activity Assay—Plk3 kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (20Xie S. Wang Q. Wu H. Cogswell J. Lu L. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36194-36199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For in vitro kinase assay, 0.25 μl (31.25 milliunits) of recombinant Plk3 was first mixed with 33 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 μm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2), 1 μlof400 μm cold ATP, and wortmannin or LY294002 at the indicated concentration. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi) and 5 μlof4 μg/μl α-casein. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The density of signals was measured with Chemilmager™ 5500 (Alpha Innotech) and analyzed by AlphaEaseFC software. The procedure of in vivo kinase assay is the same as that of in vitro kinase assay except that the recombinant Plk3 was replaced with Plk3 immunocomplex and the kinase reaction was set up in the absence of inhibitors. In brief, A549 cells were exposed to wortmannin at the indicated concentration for 30 min, washed, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody to Plk3 (19Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The resulting precipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer and subjected to kinase assay. A portion of SDS-PAGE gel from in vivo kinase assay containing Plk3 protein was used for Western blot of Plk3. The density of Plk3 bands was used for normalization of Plk3 kinase activity. Western Blot Analysis—Quenched AX7503 reactions were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to His6 or Plk3. For transfected GM00637 cells treated with or without wortmannin and H2O2, equal amounts (40 μg) of protein lysates from the treated cells were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to serine 20-phosphorylated p53. The same blots were also stripped and reprobed with antibody that recognizes p53 regardless of phosphorylation state. Signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents as described previously (20Xie S. Wang Q. Wu H. Cogswell J. Lu L. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36194-36199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation, Digestion, and Affinity Capture of AX7503-labeled Peptides—Soluble fractions from the G2/M-arrested Jurkat cells or recombinant Plk3 were labeled with 250 nm AX7503 for 60 min. The AX7503-labeled recombinant Plk3 was then added to preboiled mouse brain soluble fraction (0.5 mg/ml). The samples were then denatured with urea, incubated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin as described previously (27Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After digestion, peptides were captured by agarose beads conjugated to monoclonal anti-tetramethylrhodamine antibody. The enriched, labeled peptides were eluted from the capture beads with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as described previously (27Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Identification of AX7503 Labeling Sites on Plks—Peptides were analyzed in a combination system of a capillary HPLC Micro Autosampler (Agilent Technologies) and LTQ-linear ion trap mass spectrometer with nano-ESI source (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) and were identified with TurboSEQUEST (Thermo Finnigan). 5 μl of labeled tryptic peptides was injected through a micro autosampler, desalted, and concentrated on a peptide capTrap (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). The tagged peptides were then separated in a 0.18 × 100-mm, C18, 5-mm reversed-phase column with a gradient of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid to 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid for 2 h with a column flow of 1.5 ml/min and injected into the LTQ mass spectrometer. Data were acquired in data-dependent MS/MS on the top nine ions on a full scan in the range of 500 to 1800 m/z with the following settings: spray voltage, 1.8 kV; capillary temperature, 200 °C; capillary voltage, 46 V; tube lens voltage, 120 V; relative collision energy, 35%. LC-MS/MS data were searched against protein data bases by using the SEQUEST algorithm as described previously (27Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Polo-like Kinase 3 by Wortmannin—We recently showed that wortmannin is a potent inhibitor of Plk1 and AX7503, a tetramethylrhodamine-wortmannin conjugate, is an activity-dependent probe for labeling Plk1 (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To determine whether AX7503 could also label Plk3, another member of the Polo family, we incubated recombinant human His6-tagged Plk3 with AX7503 in the presence or absence of preincubation with wortmannin. As seen in Fig. 1, AX7503 strongly labeled Plk3. This labeling of Plk3 by AX7503 was totally blocked by preincubation of Plk3 with wortmannin. Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-His6 antibody showed the presence of equivalent levels of His6 tagged-Plk3 in both wortmannin-treated and untreated samples. These results indicated that AX7503 is an effective probe for Plk3 as well as for Plk1. To determine the potency of wortmannin as an inhibitor of Plk3, we quantified competition between AX7503 and wortmannin for Plk3. As seen in Fig. 2A, wortmannin inhibited Plk3 reacting with AX7503 in a dose-dependent manner. By fitting the dose-response data in Fig. 2B, the IC50 value of wortmannin for inhibiting labeling of Plk3 by AX7503 was determined to be 49 nm. We also determined the potency of LY294002 as an inhibitor of Plk3-AX7503 reactivity (Fig. 2B). LY294002 is a less potent noncovalent inhibitor of PI 3-kinases; it has been shown to inhibit Plk1 with a potency similar to that of PI 3-kinases (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We found that LY294002 prevented Plk3 labeling with AX7503. The LY294002 IC50 value for inhibiting Plk3-AX7503 reactivity was determined to be 3.0 μm. These results demonstrated that wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited Plk3-AX7503 reactivity with a potency similar to their inhibition of Plk1-AX7503 reactivity; their IC50 values for inhibiting Plk1-AX7503 reactivity were 5.8 nm and 2.1 μm, respectively (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We previously reported that wortmannin and LY294002 were able to inhibit Plk1 activity in an in vitro substrate-based assay (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To determine whether wortmannin and LY294002 could inhibit Plk3 substrate phosphorylation, we performed in vitro kinase assays using casein as a substrate. By fitting the dose-response data in Fig. 3, the in vitro kinase result showed that wortmannin could potently inhibit the activity of purified Plk3 with an IC50 of 48 nm, consistent with the results obtained from the AX7503 reactivity assay (Fig. 2). As in the AX7503 assay, LY294002 was a much less potent inhibitor of Plk3 than wortmannin; in the substrate assay the IC50 value for inhibiting Plk3 was 88 μm. Identification of AX7503 Labeling Sites on Plk1 and Plk3—To identify the site of labeling on Plks targeted by AX7503, we applied an LC-MS/MS platform (27Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W.

Patricelli M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4996-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The AX7503-labeled purified Plk3 was added to heat-denatured mouse brain proteome as carrier. The sample was denatured, reduced, alkylated, and digested as described previously (27Adam G.C.

For identification of the labeling site on Plk1, Jurkat cells were first chemically synchronized at G2/M, where the level and activity of Plk1 reach maximal during the cell cycle (4Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Soluble protein extracts from the G2/M-arrested cells were labeled with AX7503, denatured, reduced, alkylated, and digested as described previously (27Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W.

Analysis of the labeling site of AX7503 on Plk3 by using LC-MS/MS and the SEQUEST search algorithms identified a single AX7503-modified peptide spanning cysteine 76 to arginine 97 (Fig. 4). Lysine 91 was identified to be the probe-labeled residue (Fig. 4). Similarly, analysis of the labeling site of AX7503 on Plk1 also identified a single AX7503-modified peptide spanning cysteine 67 to lysine 86 where lysine 82 was identified to be the probe-labeled residue (data not shown). Table 1 summarizes the sites of labeling of Plk1 and Plk3 by AX7503. As seen in Table 1, a single AX7503-modified peptide was identified for each enzyme, and MS/MS analysis identified a specific site of AX7503 labeling on each peptide (shown by asterisks in Table 1). Sequence alignment of human Polo subfamily members revealed that the labeling sites of AX7503 on Plk1 and Plk3 occurred on a conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding site (Fig. 5).TABLE 1Sites of labeling of Plk1 and Plk3 for AX7503EnzymeLabeled peptideaAn asterisk follows the amino acid labeled by AX7503Labeling siteResiduePlk1CFEISDADTKEVFAGK*IVPKLys-82ATP bindingPlk3CYEATDTETGSAYAVK*VIPQSRLys-91ATP bindinga An asterisk follows the amino acid labeled by AX7503 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5Sequence alignment of human Polo subfamily members in the local region surrounding their ATP binding site (marked by anasterisk).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next explored the impact on AX7503 reactivity of replacing lysine 91 with arginine. Mutation of lysine 91 has been shown to inactivate Plk3 kinase activity (21Xie S. Wu H. Wang Q. Cogswell J.P. Husain I. Conn C. Stambrook P. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43305-43312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mutant Plk3 (K91R) and wild-type Plk3 were expressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection. As seen in Fig. 6A, AX7503 labeled wide-type Plk3, but labeling of mutant Plk3 was either completely abolished or vastly reduced. Western blot analysis confirmed equivalent expression levels for both wide-type and mutant Plk3 (Fig. 6B). These results agree with our previous findings that AX7503 reacts with wide-type Plk1 but not with the mutant Plk1 (K82R) (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In Vivo Inhibition of Plk3 by Wortmannin—Wortmannin is widely used to inhibit PI 3-kinases. Recent studies showed that wortmannin was able to inhibit Plk1 activity in intact Jurkat cells at concentrations commonly used to inhibit PI-3 kinases (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To determine whether wortmannin could also inhibit Plk3 in live cells, we performed an in vivo kinase assay using A549 cells (Fig. 7). First, A549 cells were exposed to wortmannin for 30 min at the indicated concentrations and then cells were collected, washed, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Plk3 antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes were used for in vitro kinase assay with casein as substrate. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of the living A549 cells with wortmannin led to a decrease in the activity of Plk3. The IC50 value of wortmannin for inhibiting Plk3 by the in vivo assay was determined to be 0.22 μm. The in vivo potency was within 5-fold of the cell free potency (Fig. 7). Western blot analysis with a monoclonal Plk3 antibody confirmed that the expression of Plk3 did not change upon treating cells with wortmannin (data not shown). These results indicate that wortmannin inhibits both Plk3 and Plk1 in experiments where its use is intended to inhibit PI 3-kinases. Inhibition of Plk3-mediated Phosphorylation of p53 by Wortmannin—We next conducted experiments to determine the impact of wortmannin treatment on a representative Plk3 biological function, the response to a DNA damage checkpoint. Plk3 was transfected into GM00637 cells for 16 h followed by treatment with or without wortmannin (1 μm) prior to H2O2 treatment. As expected, H2O2 significantly increased the level of serine 20-phosphorylated p53 in the Plk3-transfected cells (Fig. 8) (20Xie S. Wang Q. Wu H. Cogswell J. Lu L. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36194-36199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, preincubation with wortmannin at 1 μm, which inhibited 75% of Plk3 activity in A549 cells, largely impaired the up-regulation of p53 serine 20 phosphorylation (Figs. 7 and 8). This result indicated that wortmannin was able to suppress cellular Plk3 activity and, consequently, decrease the downstream p53 phosphorylation induced by the DNA damage checkpoint. In this study, we show that wortmannin covalently labels Plk1 and Plk3 by targeting conserved lysine residues in their ATP binding sites. Wortmannin inhibits Plk1 and Plk3 with a potency similar to its inhibition of PI 3-kinases (Figs. 2 and 3) (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Wortmannin was found to inhibit Plk3 activity within cells, and it suppressed the Plk3-mediated phosphorylation of p53 on the serine 20 residue induced by H2O2, demonstrating an effect of wortmannin on a downstream Plk target. The Plk family consists of four members, Plk1–Plk4. Because the kinase domains of Plks are highly conserved (29% amino acid identity for all four enzymes, 48% amino acid identity among Plk1, Plk2, and Plk3), our results suggest that wortmannin should also inhibit Plk2 and Plk4. Indeed, preliminary experiments indicate that AX7503 labels recombinant Plk2 (data not shown). This labeling was strongly inhibited by prior incubation of Plk2 with 1 μm wortmannin (data not shown), suggesting that it is specific. The finding that wortmannin inhibits Plks is significant because there is a very low level of sequence similarity between PI 3-kinases and Plks. Even within the kinase domain, Plk1 and PI 3-kinase share only 11% pairwise amino acid identity. Thus, it is interesting to understand the molecular mechanism of the interaction between wortmannin and Plks. Wortmannin irreversibly reacts with PI 3-kinases and PI 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM, ATR (ATM and rad3-related), and DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) on a conserved lysine residue in the kinase domain (29Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Our results show that wortmannin also labels Plk1 and Plk3 on a lysine residue in the ATP binding sites. These findings reinforce previous observations that enzymes with no apparent sequence identity may have related active site structures to perform their molecular functions and that chemical probes like AX7503 can be used to discover such relatedness (30Adam G.C. Cravatt B.F. Sorensen E.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 81-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additionally, because kinases are popular targets for drug discovery, this work highlights the need for new methods to determine kinase inhibitor specificity. Currently, most selectivity screening is either performed in-house against a panel of kinases with sequence similarity to the drug target (for example containing either PI 3-kinases or Plks but not both) or outsourced against a panel of recombinant kinases for which in vitro assays have been developed. Proteomic methods such as the one presented in this work have the distinct advantage that selectivity screening can be performed broadly against relevant enzymes in a particular system rather than only against enzymes that can be recombinantly expressed and for which appropriate substrates are known. Because wortmannin has been used extensively to experimentally inhibit PI 3-kinases, it is of interest to know whether Plks are also inhibited by wortmannin in vivo. Our current and previous studies have showed that wortmannin significantly inhibits Plk1 and Plk3 activity at the concentrations (50–500 nm) of wortmannin commonly used for inhibiting PI 3-kinases in live cells (26Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinases play a central role in many physiological and pathological processes related to cancer, inflammation, immunology, and cardiovascular disease (31Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that some of the pharmacological effects of wortmannin, originally assumed to reflect the inhibition of PI 3-kinases, might be because of the inactivation of Plks. Moreover, wortmannin is also used to inhibit PIKKs such as ATM in live cells at higher concentrations (micromolar) of wortmannin because of the reduced potency of wortmannin in inhibiting members of these kinases (32Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). PIKKs play central roles in stress-induced signaling pathways (33Abraham R.T. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 34Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2004; 118: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that wortmannin should lead to complete inhibition of Plk1 and Plk3 at the concentrations that are used to inhibit PIKKs. Therefore, some effects of wortmannin that were originally assumed to reflect the inactivation of PIKKs may be due to inhibition of Plks. We thank John W. Kozarich and Benjamin F. Cravatt for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2008157099,"The predominant product of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in the colon, prostaglandin (PG) E2 promotes intestinal tumorigenesis. Expression of the PGE2 receptor EP4 is upregulated during colorectal carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the role of elevated PGE2-EP4 receptor signalling in the protumorigenic activity of PGE2 by increasing EP4 receptor expression in HT-29 human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (HT-29-EP4) by stable transfection. Elevated PGE2-induced EP4 receptor activity in HT-29 cells increased resistance to spontaneous apoptosis and promoted anchorage-independent growth, but had no effect on proliferation of HT-29-EP4 cells. EP4 receptor activation by PGE2 in HT-29-EP4 cells also led to development of fluid-filled cysts, which was associated with increased tight junction protein (occludin and zonula occludens-1) expression. Overexpression of the EP4 receptor in HT-29 cells led to basal EP4 receptor signalling in the absence of exogenous PGE2, which was explained by autocrine activity of endogenous, COX-2-derived PGE2 and constitutive, ligand-independent EP4 receptor activity. The predominant signalling pathway mediating antiapoptotic activity downstream of PGE2-EP4 receptor activation in HT-29-EP4 cells was elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which was associated with phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein. EP4 receptor activation led to a small increase in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 protein levels but inhibition of ERK phosphorylation did not abrogate the antiapoptotic activity of PGE2. However, PGE2-EP4 receptor signalling did not lead to trans-activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in HT-29 cells. Inhibition of protumorigenic PGE2-EP4 receptor signalling represents a potential strategy for anti-CRC therapy that may avoid the toxicity associated with systemic COX inhibition."

Bayer A.S. Xiong Y.Q. Yeaman M.R. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 435-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that cathelicidins and defensins (for review, see Refs. 6Yount N.Y. Bayer A.S. Xiong Y.Q. Yeaman M.R.

Lambris J.D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2001; 25: 745-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) identified in the deuterostome Ciona intestinalis (13Pinto M.R. Chinnici C.M. Kimura Y. Melillo D. Marino R. Spruce L.A. De Santis R. Parrinello N. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5521-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as in the horse-shoe crab Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, a protostome considered a “living fossil” originating over 500 million years ago (14Zhu Y. Thangamani S. Ho B. Ding J.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These animals, which lack adaptive immunity, mount an effective antimicrobial defense in response to pathogens. In this work utilizing a combination of phylogenetic studies and structural and sequence alignments paired with biophysical and functional analyses, we have shown that structural prerequisites governing antimicrobial activity can be traced from the human C3a molecule back to the C3a molecules of invertebrates, such as those found in C. rotundicauda. Microorganisms—Escherichia coli 37.4, Enterococcus faecalis 2374, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27.1, E. coli American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25922, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and Candida albicans ATCC 90028 were obtained from the Department of Microbiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. Peptides and Proteins—C3a and C4a were obtained from The Binding Site, Inc. (San Diego, CA), whereas C5a-desArg was from Calbiochem. The peptides GKE31, LGE33, CNY21, CQF20, CVV20 (for sequences, see Fig. 2), and tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-conjugated CNY21 and CQF20 were synthesized by Innovagen (Lund, Sweden). The purity (>95%) and molecular weight of these peptides were confirmed by mass spectral analysis (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, Voyager). 20-mer peptides corresponding to various regions of C3a (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 2) were from Sigma (PEPscreen®, Custom Peptide Libraries, SigmaGenosys). Phylogenetic Analyses—C3a, C4a, and C5a amino acid sequences were retrieved from the NCBI site. Each sequence was analyzed with Psi-Blast (NCBI) (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) to find the ortholog and paralog sequences. Sequences that showed structural homology >70% were selected. These sequences were aligned using ClustalW (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) using Blosum 69 protein weight matrix settings (17Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4330) Google Scholar). Internal adjustments were made taking the structural alignment into account utilizing the ClustalW interface. The level of consistency of each position within the alignment was estimated by using the alignment-evaluating software Tcoffee (18Poirot O. Suhre K. Abergel C. O'Toole E. Notredame C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W37-W40Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). C3a, C4a, and C5a sequences were used for phylogenetic tree construction by using the neighbor-joining method (19Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). The generated tree was rooted with human C3a, and the reliability of each branch was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replications. For determination of non-synonymous (amino acid-altering) and synonymous (silent) nucleotide substitutions (dN and dS) (20Tennessen J.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) we used the codeml PAML software. cDNA sequences corresponding to the various C3a peptides of vertebrates were downloaded from the NCBI site (supplemental Table 1). Molecular Modeling—A comparative homology model of C. rotundicauda C3a was created based on the structure of human C3a (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2A73 (21Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar)). The sequence of human C3a (residues 651–719 in C3, corresponding to 2–70 in C3a) was aligned against the sequence of C. rotundicauda C3a using the alignment in Fig. 2. For clarity, amino acid numbering in the text below is based on the position in the respective anaphylatoxin peptide, defining the N terminus after the RKKR processing site. Structural alignment of C3a and C5a structures revealed that the regions corresponding to Arg8–Tyr15, Leu19–Met27, and Lys50–Leu63 in human C3a (Fig. 2) correspond to structure-conserved regions. Residues Ile2–Asn67 of C. rotundicauda C3a were built using the Prime module (22Jacobson M.P. Pincus D.L. Rapp C.S. Day T.J. Honig B. Shaw D.E. Friesner R.A. Proteins. 2004; 55: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) from the Schrödinger computational chemistry suite of programs (Schrödinger, L.L.C., Portland, OR). The sequence identity was 26% (similarity 38%), and rotamers from the conserved residues were retained. Terminal tails beyond secondary structure elements were not built. Loops 1 (Glu11–Arg13) and 2 (Asp27–Arg29) were refined one at a time using default sampling in the loop refinement protocol built into Prime, except the long inserted loop 3 (Glu39–Glu47) where extended medium sampling was used. Disulfur bridges Cys17–Cys49, Cys18–Cys56, and Cys31–Cys57 were built and minimized prior to refinement. A stepwise refinement protocol involving minimization of (a) side chains from non-structure-conserved regions, (b) both backbone and side chains from non-structure-conserved regions, and (c) all side chains were employed. The refined comparative model of C. rotundicauda C3a was extended in the C terminus by residues Ile68–Arg75. These residues were added in an α-helical conformation and minimized. Some adjustment of the Ψ/ϕ values of Leu64, Leu65, Lys66, and Asn67 to helical values were necessary prior to minimization. All atoms of residues Leu64–Arg75 were minimized of this extended model. Finally, all side chains were minimized resulting in the described model. Minimization was performed using the MacroModel module from the Schrödinger computational chemistry suite of programs using a dielectric constant of 1 and the OPLS2005 force field. Comparative homology models of human C4a (residues 1–77) and C. intestinalis C3a (residues 2–76) were constructed using the same template, refinement protocol, and minimization as above and the alignment in Fig. 2. The last seven and five residues, respectively, were added in α-helical conformations and minimized. Sequence identities were 29% (51% similarity) for human C4a and 17% (37% similarity) for C. intestinalis C3a when compared with human C3a. Radial Diffusion Assay—Essentially as described earlier (23Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), bacteria were grown to mid-log phase in 10 ml of full-strength (3% w/v) trypticase soy broth (TSB) (BD Biosciences). The microorganisms were washed once with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. 4 × 106 bacterial colony-forming units were added to 5 ml of the underlay-agarose gel (0.03% TSB, 1% low electroendosmosis-type agarose (Sigma) and 0.02% Tween 20 (Sigma)). The underlay was poured into an 85-mm-diameter Petri dish (or 144 mm diameter for the experiment with PEPscreen peptides). After agarose solidification, 4-mm-diameter wells were punched, and 6 μl of test peptide was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow diffusion of the peptides. The underlay gel was then covered with 5 ml of molten overlay (6% TSB and 1% low electroendosmosis-type agarose in distilled H2O). The antimicrobial activity of a peptide was visualized as a zone of clearing around each well after incubating 18–24 h at 37 °C. The activity of the human complement-derived peptides LGE33, CNY21, CQF21, and CVV20 as well as GKE31 of C. rotundicauda (at 50 and/or 100 μm) were compared with the activity of the peptide LL-37. In all cases, triplicate samples were used. Viable Count Analysis—P. aeruginosa 27.1 or E. faecalis 2374 bacteria were grown to mid-log phase in Todd-Hewitt medium. Bacteria were washed and diluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm glucose. For dose-response experiments, P. aeruginosa (50 μl; 2 × 106 colony-forming units/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with the peptides GKE31 and LGE33 (P. aeruginosa) at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 60 μm. For analysis of the effects of C3a, C4a, and C5a-desArg (see Fig. 7A), P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis 2374 were used, and the peptide concentration was 3 μm. To quantify the bactericidal activity, serial dilutions of the incubation mixture were plated on Todd-Hewitt agar followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight, and the number of colony-forming units was determined. Electron Microscopy—P. aeruginosa 27.1 (1–2 × 107/sample) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the peptides GKE31 or LGE33 at ∼90% of their required bactericidal concentration (6 μm), as judged by dose-response experiments using viable count assays (not shown). LL-37 (6 μm) was included as a control. Samples of P. aeruginosa bacteria suspensions were adsorbed onto carbon-coated copper grids for 2 min, washed briefly on two drops of water, and negatively stained on two drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in ambient air. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at 60 kV of accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 charge-coupled device camera. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—The CD spectra of the peptides in solution were measured on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). The measurements were performed at 37 °C in a 10-mm quartz cuvette under stirring, and the effect on peptide secondary structure was monitored in the range of 200–250 nm. The background value (detected at 250 nm, where no peptide signal is present) was subtracted, and signals from the bulk solution were corrected. The peptide secondary structure was monitored at a peptide concentration of 10 μm both in Tris buffer and in the presence of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (0.02% w/w) (E. coli 0111:B4, highly purified, <1% protein/RNA; Sigma). Liposome Preparation and Leakage Assay—Dry lipid films were prepared by dissolving either dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) (60 mol %) and cholesterol (Sigma, St Louis, MO) (40 mol %) or dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (30 mol %), dioleoylphosphatidic acid (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) (30 mol %), and cholesterol (40 mol %) in chloroform and then removing the solvent by evaporation under vacuum overnight. Subsequently, buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) was added together with 0.1 m carboxyfluorescein (CF) (Sigma). After hydration, the lipid mixture was subjected to eight freeze-thaw cycles consisting of freezing in liquid nitrogen and heating to 60 °C. Unilamellar liposomes of ∼100 nm diameter were generated by multiple extrusions through polycarbonate filters (pore size 100 nm) mounted in a LipoFast miniextruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) at 22 °C. Untrapped CF was then removed by two gel filtrations (Sephadex G-50) at 22 °C with the Tris buffer as eluent. The CF release was determined by monitoring the emitted fluorescence at 520 nm from a liposome dispersion (10 mm lipid in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). An absolute leakage scale was obtained by disrupting the liposomes at the end of the experiment through the addition of 0.8 mm Triton X-100 (Sigma), thereby causing 100% release and dequenching of CF. A SPEX-fluorolog 1650 0.22 monochromatic double spectrometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) was used for the liposome leakage assay. Fluorescence Microscopy—P. aeruginosa 27.1 bacteria were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in Todd-Hewitt medium. The bacteria were washed twice in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The pellet was dissolved to yield a suspension of 5 × 106 colony-forming units/ml in the same buffer. Two hundred microliters of the bacterial suspension were incubated with either 1 μl of TAMRA-CNY21 or TAMRA-CQF21 (2 mg/ml) on ice for 5 min and washed twice in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The bacteria were then fixed by incubation on ice for 15 min and in room temperature for 45 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The suspension was applied onto poly-l-lysine-coated cover glass, and bacteria were left to attach for 30 min. The liquid was poured away, and the cover glass was mounted on a slide by Dako mounting medium (Carpinteria, CA). This was performed using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 cooled charge-coupled device camera, a Plan Apochromat 60× objective, and a high numerical aperture oil condenser. Sequence Analyses of Anaphylatoxin Homologs—Phylogenetic analysis of representative C3a peptides from invertebrates as well as vertebrates (Fig. 1) yielded valuable information. Consistent with a common ancestor, the C3a molecules all colocalized to a single group, suggesting that C3a has evolved via multiple changes in the protogene, a finding consistent with previous analyses of the evolution of the complement system (14Zhu Y. Thangamani S. Ho B. Ding J.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 24Nonaka M. Yoshizaki F. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, C4a and C5a formed separate clades, C5a being most distant from the C3a. This pattern suggests that C5a and C4a likely evolved from C3a and that C5a is the paralog to C4a and C3a (14Zhu Y. Thangamani S. Ho B. Ding J.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Comparisons of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates are useful for studying the mechanisms of gene evolution. Analysis of evolutionarily distant sequences, however, is not useful because of the saturation of amino acid changes. Nevertheless, to get useful information on possible positive selection of C3a, relevant and homologous vertebrate sequences were compared. The dS values (indicating synonymous nucleotide substitutions) ranged from 0.7 to 1.0, except for Macropus eugenii, which showed a higher substitution rate ∼2.7, whereas the dN (indicating non-synonymous substitutions) ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 (supplemental Table 1). Thus, although there was the existence of an extensive variability of certain amino acids in C3a (Fig. 2), the results from the analysis of vertebrate sequences indicated that the selection pressure imposed on the C3a molecules results in a high degree of conservation. Given this phylogenetic relationship, it was of interest to examine this molecular family closer, both from a structural as well as a functional perspective. Several common structural features exist for the corresponding C3a, C4a, and C5a sequences of various organisms crucial for the integrity and stability of the molecules (Fig. 2). A most notable feature is the existence of six disulfide-bonded cysteines, which are conserved not only in C3a but also in C4a and C5a. The three disulfide bonds stabilize the conformation of the internal “core” portion of the molecules represented by residues 22–57 in the human C3a sequence. The C3a of C. intestinalis lacks one disulfide pair (Fig. 2) and will be discussed separately below. Focusing on C3a, it is evident that, apart from cysteines, the four glycines (positions 13, 26, 46, and 74), phenylalanine (53), as well as lysines and arginines (21, 64, 77) constitute additional conserved features, suggesting their importance for the structural stability as well as function of C3a. Structural Modeling of Anaphylatoxin Peptides—Computational modeling utilizing available structural data on human C3a (21Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R.

Chem. 1980; 361: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as well as C5a peptides (26Williamson M.P. Madison V.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2895-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Zhang X. Boyar W. Toth M.J. Wennogle L. Gonnella N.C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was employed to provide further structural information. Considering the recent identification of C3 and a putative anaphylactic peptide in the arthropod C. rotundicauda (14Zhu Y. Thangamani S. Ho B. Ding J.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we decided to compare these two molecules. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, the similarity at the three-dimensional level between human C3a and the predicted C. rotundicauda C3a peptide is apparent, although having an extensive overall sequence discrepancy (26% sequence identity and 38% similarity). Both peptides share a striking similarity in the four helical regions and in the two first loops located before the cysteines at positions 22 and 36 and positions 17 and 31 in the human and C. rotundicauda peptides, respectively. The C. rotundicauda C3a has a five-amino-acid-long insert in the third loop region between the cysteines at positions 31 and 49, a feature only shared with C3a from C. intestinalis. Analogous to human C3a, the C. rotundicauda peptide contains a prominent cationic and amphipathic helical C terminus predicted to extend a few residues further than in human C3a. In human C3a, the C-terminal part of this region, being flexible in solution, strongly conforms to an α-helical conformation in anisotropic environments (1Hugli T.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 153: 181-208PubMed Google Scholar). Helical wheel diagrams (Edmundson projection) illustrate the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal helices (given a helical conformation) (Fig. 3B), as defined by the peptides GKE31 and LGE33, which encompass this region of C. rotundicauda and human C3a, respectively (see Fig. 2 for sequence). The amphipathic organization of these helices is also seen in the three-dimensional models of C. rotundicauda and human C3a (Fig. 3A). Antimicrobial Activities of C3a Peptides—To explore the structure-function relationships of C3a epitopes, overlapping peptide sequences comprising 20-mers (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 2) were synthesized and screened for antimicrobial activities against P. aeruginosa, a ubiquitous pathogen found among both vertebrates as well as invertebrates. The experiments showed that, particularly, peptides derived from the C-terminal regions of C. rotundicauda, Ciona, and Branchiostoma as well as from the vertebrates Homo, Sus, Mus, Rattus, and Guinea, were antimicrobial (Fig. 4), whereas peptides originating from Cobra, Paralicchtys, Onchorhyncus, Eptatretus, Xenopus, and Gallus did not show any activity against bacteria (Fig. 4). Properties common for most AMPs include minimum levels of cationicity, amphipathicity, and hydrophobicity (6Yount N.Y. Bayer A.S. Xiong Y.Q. Yeaman M.R. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 435-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was interesting to note that C-terminal regions of the two former groups comprised cationic peptides, whereas the latter group comprised negatively charged peptides (illustrated by colors in Fig. 4). These results corresponded well with the phylogenetic analysis, which showed that these animals belong to different subclades, and with single nodes of divergence (Fig. 1). The global analysis of biophysical parameters showed that, in general, peptides displaying antimicrobial activity had a net charge of +2 to +4 and ∼20–40% hydrophobic amino acids. The degree of amphipathicity, as judged by the relative hydrophobic moment (μHrel), ranged from ∼0.2 to 0.4, values comparable with those observed in many helical AMPs (28Zelezetsky I. Tossi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although intuitively apparent (Fig. 4), the results confirmed that net charge correlates to antimicrobial activity (supplemental Fig. 1). Considering these findings, it is notable that a disproportionate alteration of charge appears to characterize the evolution of β-defensins (9Maxwell A.I. Morrison G.M. Dorin J.R. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Tennessen J.A. J. Evol. Biol. 2005; 18: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Analogous relationships were recently reported to apply to the evolution of primate cathelicidin, showing positive selection affecting charge while keeping hydrophobicity and amphipathicity fairly constant (11Zelezetsky I. Pontillo A. Puzzi L. Antcheva N. Segat L. Pacor S. Crovella S. Tossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19861-19871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Structural and Functional Congruence of C Termini of C3a—In humans, peptides derived from the well defined C-terminal region of C3a exert antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, human neutrophilic enzymes release similar C3a-derived peptides exerting antimicrobial effects, proving the physiological importance of this helical and antimicrobial region of C3a (2Nordahl E.A. Rydengård V. Nyberg P. Nitsche D.P. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Björck L. Schmidtchen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16879-16884Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Considering this, the following experimental analyses focused on the C-terminal region of human C3a as well as the related peptide “ancestor” from C. rotundicauda (see Figs. 2 and 3B). Indeed, the experiments showed that the C. rotundicauda peptide GKE31, spanning the whole C-terminal part of C. rotundicauda C3a, exerted similar antibacterial effects as the human homolog LGE33 against both the Gram-negative P. aeruginosa and E. coli and the Gram-positive B. subtilis (Fig. 5A). The “classical” human cathelicidin LL-37 yielded similar effects as the two C3a-derived peptides. The C. rotundicauda peptide was not active against C. albicans. To examine whether the GKE31 and LGE33 peptides interact with and permeabilize bacterial plasma membranes, P. aeruginosa was incubated with each of the two peptides at concentrations yielding ∼90% bacterial killing (6 μm) and analyzed by electron microscopy (Fig. 5B). Clear differences in the morphology of peptide-treated bacteria in comparison with the control were demonstrated by this approach. The peptides caused local perturbations and breaks along P. aeruginosa plasma membranes, and occasionally intracellular material was found extracellularly. These findings were similar to those seen after treatment with the antimicrobial human cathelicidin LL-37 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, CD spectroscopy was used to study the structure and the organization of the GKE31 and LGE33 peptides in solution and upon interaction with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Fig. 5C). Neither GKE31 nor LGE33 adopted an ordered conformation in aqueous solution; however, the CD spectra revealed that a significant and almost identical structural change, largely indicating an induction of helicity, taking place in the presence of E. coli LPS (Fig. 5C). The remarkably similar profile of both peptides indicates that, despite a marked difference in primary sequence, the peptides structure themselves in a similar way in the presence of negatively charged LPS-rich bacterial membranes. Both of the peptides also induced leaking of liposomes, thus establishing their membrane-breaking activities (Fig. 5D). Kinetic analysis showed that ∼80% of the maximum fluorescence was reached within ∼200 s for both peptides (at 1 μm) (Fig. 5E). The results therefore indicate that the GKE31 and LGE33 peptides indeed function similar to most helical AMPs, such as LL-37 (6Yount N.Y. Bayer A.S. Xiong Y.Q. Yeaman M.R. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 435-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 28Zelezetsky I. Tossi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), by interactions with LPS and most likely peptidoglycan at bacterial surfaces, leading to induction of an α-helical conformation, which in turn facilitates membrane interactions, membrane destabilization, and, finally, bacterial killing. The fact that the two C3a-derived peptides are separated by as much as over a half-billion years of evolutionary distance elegantly demonstrates the remarkable structural and functional conservation of this C-terminal peptide region. Comparison of C3a Molecules of C. rotundicauda and C. intestinalis—The C3a molecule of Ciona is functionally active; it exerts chemotactic effects (13Pinto M.R. Chinnici C.M. Kimura Y. Melillo D. Marino R. Spruce L.A. De Santis R. Parrinello N. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5521-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and, as shown here, has a C-terminal antibacterial part (Fig. 4). However, in contrast to the other C3a molecules, C3a of Ciona lacks one disulfide bridge (Fig. 2). Despite this, and a sequence identity of only 17% (37% similarity) with human C3a, molecular modeling and conformational analysis show that Ciona C3a adopts a predicted conformation similar to other C3a molecules (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the first missing cysteine in Ciona C3a is replaced by a glycine residue (Gly18), whereas the second cysteine is replaced by a glutamate residue (Glu57). Hypothetically, these changes could enable the second helix to approach and interact with the C-terminal helix by formation of a salt bridge between Glu57 and Lys22, thus compensating for the loss of a disulfide bond. These interactions, together with main structural constraints imposed by the remaining two disulfide pairs preserve the overall topology of Ciona C3a (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, it is notable that residues forming the inner core throughout the anaphylatoxin family (Gly21, Ile/Val39, and Phe54) are all conserved in Ciona C3a (Fig. 2). Taken together, these structural considerations, combined with the functional data, further underscore the conservation of C3a. Structure and Activities of C4a and C5a—The phylogenetic analysis indicated that C5a evolved separately from the family of C3a as well as C4a molecules (Fig. 1). To address whether this also reflected a functional difference, we compared the antibacterial activities of human C3a with C4a, and C5a (the latter only available in desArg form) and their corresponding peptides from the C terminus. C3a and C4a both exerted antibacterial effects, whereas the C5a peptide was inactive (Fig. 7A). Corroborating results were obtained with the corresponding C-terminal peptides (Fig. 7B; for sequences, see Fig. 2). Although the C3a-and C4a-derived peptides (CNY21 and CQF21, respectively) killed the Gram-negative P. aeruginosa and E. coli, the Gram-positive B. subtilis, as well as the fungus C. albicans, the C5a peptide (CVV20) was inactive against these microbes. The fact that the C5a-derived peptide CVV20 contained a terminal arginine and that there is no difference in antimicrobial activity between C3a and C3adesArg as well as the corresponding C3a-derived peptides CNY21 and CNY20 (2Nordahl E.A. Rydengård V. Nyberg P. Nitsche D.P. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Björck L. Schmidtchen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16879-16884Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the terminal arginine is dispensable for antimicrobial activity of these peptides. Finally, the interaction between the antimicrobial peptides CNY21 (C3a) and CQF21 (C4a) and bacterial plasma membranes was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The peptides were labeled with the fluorescent dye TAMRA and incubated with P. aeruginosa. As demonstrated, the peptides bound to the bacterial surface, and the binding was completely blocked by the negatively charged glycosaminoglycan heparin (Fig. 7C). As seen in the three-dimensional models, the last ten residues in C5a form a short α-helix that is bent backwards through a short loop positioning the carboxyl terminal arginine (Arg74) in close proximity to arginine 62 (Fig. 3A), a feature that is believed to be important for receptor binding (27Zhang X. Boyar W. Toth M.J. Wennogle L. Gonnella N.C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, C5a display a significantly different structure when compared with both C4a and C3a, lacking the typical C-terminal and antimicrobial protruding peptide (Fig. 3A), thus compatible with the experimental results presented herein. This observation, paired with the separate evolutionary development of C5a, indicate that this molecule has evolved separately in higher organisms into a purely chemotactic and highly spasmogenic molecule. In conclusion, the combination of phylogenetic, structural, biophysical, and biological analyses point at a preservation of structures crucial for antimicrobial activity of C3a in invertebrates as well as vertebrate lineages. Although speculative, the difference noted in C3a of jawless fishes, likely abolishing the antimicrobial activity of C3a, may not only reflect the multifunctional role of C3a but could also indicate a gain of other functions during the separation from invertebrates in the ordovician period (500 million years ago). The observation that anaphylatoxins have unforeseen biological effects in fish is compatible with this hypothesis (30Sunyer J.O. Boshra H. Li J. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2005; 108: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, significant changes in cationicity are observed in defensins as well as cathelicidins, even in closely related species (such as primates) (11Zelezetsky I. Pontillo A. Puzzi L. Antcheva N. Segat L. Pacor S. Crovella S. Tossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19861-19871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Semple C.A. Rolfe M. Dorin J.R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, indicative of a strong non-neutral evolution, gene duplications and subsequent variations have led to further generation of different AMPs (29Tennessen J.A. J. Evol. Biol. 2005; 18: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For example, the C-terminal domains of cathelicidins may range from a dozen to over eighty residues forming cysteine-bridged hairpins (bovine bactenecin) and tryptophan-rich (bovine indolicidin), proline-rich (porcine PR-39), or α-helical molecules (human LL-37) (8Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this context, it is interesting to note that a unifying structural motif (γ-core) was recently revealed in many diverse AMPs, such as protegrins, defensins, and chemokines, thus indicating the existence of previously unprecedented higher level structural motifs that govern antimicrobial functions (6Yount N.Y. Bayer A.S. Xiong Y.Q. Yeaman M.R. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 435-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Being multifunctional, also acting as immune modulators, the generation of many structurally diverse AMPs likely reflects an evolutionary adaptation to the microbial environment as well as introduction of novel biological functions in a given organism. Contrasting to this, C3a has maintained strikingly similar features governing antimicrobial activity, despite a significant primary sequence variation. Thus, in addition to the “innovative” generation of AMPs in nature, our findings on C3a illustrate an alternative concept where molecules are subjected to strong and precise selection forces aiming at maintaining a robust and structurally intact innate defense system.

Pancreatic β cells express multiple isoforms of PKCs; however, the role of each isoform in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion remains controversial. In this study we investigated the role of PKCδ, a major isoform expressed in pancreatic β cells on β cell function. Here, we showed that PKCδ null mice manifested glucose intolerance with impaired insulin secretion. Insulin tolerance test showed no decrease in insulin sensitivity in PKCδ null mice. Studies using islets isolated from these mice demonstrated decreased glucose- and KCl-stimulated insulin secretion. Perifusion studies indicated that mainly the second phase of insulin secretion was decreased. On the other hand, glucose-induced influx of Ca2+ into β cells was not altered. Immunohistochemistry using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopic analysis showed an increased number of insulin granules close to the plasma membrane in β cells of PKCδ null mice. Although PKC is thought to phosphorylate Munc18-1 and facilitate soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors complex formation, the phosphorylation of Munc18-1 by glucose stimulation was decreased in islets of PKCδ null mice. We conclude that PKCδ plays a non-redundant role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The impaired insulin secretion in PKCδ null mice is associated with reduced phosphorylation of Munc18-1.

We conclude that PKCδ plays a non-redundant role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The impaired insulin secretion in PKCδ null mice is associated with reduced phosphorylation of Munc18-1. Altered regulation of insulin secretion is a common feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The mechanism of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion involves closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels by increased levels of glucose metabolites followed by depolarization of the plasma membrane and increased influx of Ca2+ via voltage-dependent gating of Ca2+ channels. The resultant elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) triggers transport of insulin into the plasma membrane and exocytosis (1Nesher R. Anteby E. Yedovizky M. Warwar N. Kaiser N. Cerasi E. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 68-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the events involved in initiating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion are well studied, those of regulated exocytosis are considerably less clear, although it is reported that several molecules expressed in β cells play a crucial role in exocytosis (2Gerber S.H. Sudhof T.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various protein kinases are activated by downstream signals of glucose metabolism; however, their precise contribution to insulin secretion is not clear yet (3Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) 2The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; SNAP25, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; KRS, Krebs-Ringer solution; VAMP2, vesicular-associated membrane protein 2; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; RT, reverse transcription. is one such protein kinase. Previous studies revealed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which activates PKC, could trigger insulin secretion (4Komatsu M. Schermerhorn T. Aizawa T. Sharp G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PKC is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by molecular structure and activation requirement. The isoforms consist of the conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ), which are sensitive to Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG), novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), which are sensitive to DAG only, and atypical PKCs (ζ, ι), which do not respond to either Ca2+ or DAG (11Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Idris I. Gray S. Donnelly R. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 659-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The β cells express PKCα and -δ as major isoforms of PKC. However, other isoforms of PKC are also expressed in β cells (7Carpenter L. Mitchell C.J. Xu Z.Z. Poronnik P. Both G.W. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Knutson K.L. Hoenig M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Knutson K.L. Hoenig M.

The importance of each PKC isoform in β cell function is not clear yet, mainly due to the scarcity of true isoform-specific inhibitors. Pancreatic β cells express the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins such as vesicular-associated membrane protein (VAMP), synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25), and syntaxin-1A, which form the core machinery for vesicular docking on target membrane and membrane fusion (17Nagamatsu S. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Matsushima S. Watanabe T. Ozawa S. Furukawa H. Ishida H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2367-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the machinery of regulated exocytosis, additional families of other proteins function as SNARE regulators, such as Sec/Munc18 proteins (19Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Munc18-1, a family member of Munc18, binds with high affinity to syntaxin-1A. In the Munc18-1-syntaxin-1A complex, syntaxin is in a closed conformation, whereby its N-terminal helices are folded back onto the C-terminal SNARE motif. Release of syntaxin into an open conformation seems to be required for the association of syntaxin with the SNARE complex (19Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that Munc18-1 must be released from syntaxin-1 for the fusion event. Previous data showed that PKC could phosphorylate Munc18-1 and allow it to be released for binding with syntaxin-1A (20Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, several studies have cast doubt on the role of Munc18-1 and its modulators (19Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In addition, the involvement of these events in β cell is not fully elucidated yet. In the present study, as a first step to elucidate the involvement of PKCδ inβ cell function, we investigated the function of PKCδ in β cells using mice with disruption of the PKCδ gene (PKCδ-/-). The results showed that disruption of the PKCδ gene impaired exocytosis of insulin containing granules, concomitant with decreased glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of Munc18-1. Animals—The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Juntendo University. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities, maintained 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard rodent food (Oriental Yeast Co., Osaka, Japan) and provided with water ad libitum. In this study, we used 8–20-week-old male mice with C57BL/6J background. We mated PKCδ+/- mice to generate PKCδ-/- mice, PKCδ+/- mice, and wild type mice. Then these mice were used for further analyses. PCR analysis for determination of genotype was performed as described previously (21Miyamoto A. Nakayama K. Imaki H. Hirose S. Jiang Y. Abe M. Tsukiyama T. Nagahama H. Ohno S. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. Nature. 2002; 416: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Measurement of Blood Glucose and Insulin Levels for Phenotypic Characterization—After an overnight fast (16 h), age-matched 8-, 12-, 16-, and 20-week-old male mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose at 1.0 g/kg of body weight. For the insulin tolerance test, age-matched 12-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with insulin (0.75 units/kg). A few microliters of blood samples were taken from the tail vein in awake mice, and glucose levels were measured using whole blood with a compact glucose analyzer (Free Style®, KISSEI Pharmaceutical Co., Nagano, Japan) at the indicated time points. To measure insulin levels, whole blood samples were collected and centrifuged with EDTA and aprotinin. After centrifugation, plasma was stored at -80 °C until analysis. Insulin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Morinaga Co., Kanagawa, Japan). Assay of Insulin Secretion from Isolated Islets and Islet Insulin Content—Pancreatic islets were isolated from 12-week-old mice by collagenase digestion, as described previously (17Nagamatsu S. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Matsushima S. Watanabe T. Ozawa S. Furukawa H. Ishida H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2367-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The islets were preincubated for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer solution (KRS) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and saturated humidity. Size-matched 5 islets were incubated in 400 μl of KRS containing various insulinotrophic agents for 30 min at 37 °C. For measurement of islet insulin content, islets were solubilized in acid-ethanol solution overnight at 4 °C. All samples were stored at -80 °C until assay. Insulin concentration using isolated islets was analyzed by radioimmunoassay (LINCO insulin kit, LINCO Research Inc., St. Charles, MO). Islet insulin content was calculated after correction by DNA contents. Islet Perifusion—Pancreatic islets were isolated as mentioned above and preincubated for 30 min in KRS. Size-matched 50 islets were placed in each column. Then, the kinetics of insulin release was studied using the perfusion system described previously (22Gorogawa S. Fujitani Y. Kaneto H. Hazama Y. Watada H. Miyamoto Y. Takeda K. Akira S. Magnuson M.A. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Hori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Analysis and Quantification of β Cell Area—After anesthetization, 12-week-old mice were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the pancreas was removed and fixed overnight in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. The fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and then cut into 5-μm-thick sections and mounted on slides. The sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for insulin using guinea pig anti-human insulin antibody (Linco Inc.) as described previously (23Choi J.B. Uchino H. Azuma K. Iwashita N. Tanaka Y. Mochizuki H. Migita M. Shimada T. Kawamori R. Watada H. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1366-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The β cell area was determined in 10 insulin-stained sections separated by 200 μm by evaluating the mean area of the individual cell. Images were captured with a microscope (E800; Nikon, Tokyo) connected to a digital camera (Sony, Tokyo). The area of insulin-stained pancreatic islets was determined automatically using image analysis software Pro4.5J Planetron (Tokyo). β cell area was calculated using the following formula: islet β cell area (%) = (area stained by insulin antibody/whole pancreatic area) × 100. Nonspecific insulin staining was excluded from quantification of β cell area. Measurement of [Ca2+]i in Single Mouse β Cells—Isolated islets were placed in 100 μl of Ca2+-free KRS containing 1 mm EGTA and gently agitated till turbidity due to the floating dispersed islets. After centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min, 50 μlof the supernatant was discarded, and 150 μl fresh KRS was decanted for washing. Finally, 50 μl of residual dispersed islets were again gently agitated and incubated on 0.04 mg/ml fibronectin-coated (Koken Co., Tokyo) Petri dishes with a 35-mm cover glass in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and under 5% CO2 for 3 days. Cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 200 μl of KRS containing 2.8 mm glucose for 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation, Fura2-loaded cells were placed in KRS supplemented with 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose on a micro-warm plate (Kitazato Co., Shizuoka, Japan) maintained at 37 °C and mounted on the stage of TE300 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo). The loaded cells were excited at 340 and 380 nm; the florescence emitted at 510 nm was captured by an intensified charge-couple device camera. The images were analyzed by ARGUS/HiSCA system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka). Electron Microscopy—Each mouse at 12 weeks of age was anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and the pancreas was removed after cardiac perfusion and fixed in a solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The pancreas was cut into pieces of ∼1 mm3. The pieces were fixed for 2 h in 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffered to pH 7.4 with phosphate buffer and treated with osmium tetroxide for 2 h at 4 °C. The tissues were dehydrated with graded concentrations of ethanol solutions and then embedded with Epon 812. Thin sections were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT using a diamond knife and then stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. Electron micrographs were taken with a JEOL JEM-1200EX electron microscope operated at 80 kV. To measure the number of insulin granules according to their distance from the granule center, isolated islets obtained from 5 mice were incubated in KRBB (2.8 or 16.7 mmol/liter glucose) at 37 °C for 60 min. After incubation, islets were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 90 min at room temperature. Fixed islets were further treated by osmium tetroxide and then embedded in epoxy-resin. Micrographs were taken randomly at a ×3000 magnification. Using image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus Version 4.0, Planetron), we counted the total number of insulin granules that resided within 500 nm of the plasma membrane. Then, the insulin granules were categorized according to their distance from the granule center to the plasma membrane (0–100, 100–200, 200–300, 300–500 nm), and the number of insulin granules in each fraction was counted. Data were presented as % distribution below the plasma membrane. In these experiments, 100% corresponds to total counts of insulin granules that resided within 500 nm of the plasma membrane. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Imaging Study— The Olympus total internal reflection system (Olympus, Tokyo) was used for counting the number of insulin granules 80 nm from the plasma membrane in β cells after immunostaining of insulin as described previously (24Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nishiwaki C. Kikuta T. Nagai S. Nakamichi Y. Nagamatsu S. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Tissue RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR— Total RNA was isolated from ∼200 islets using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and first strand cDNA was synthesized using 3 μg of total RNA with Oligo(dT) primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For quantitative SYBR Green real-time PCR, cDNA was analyzed by ABI 7700 PCR with 2×SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and specific primers. Thermal cycle for amplification was set as follows; 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Using this protocol, neither nonspecific primer-dimmer amplification nor PCR products were observed in no-template control samples. Single-band PCR products were detected by 1% agarose gels with end reaction products. The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated by the cycle threshold (Ct) method with standard cDNA. As an internal invariant standard, we used β-actin mRNA. The primers used were as follows: PKCα, forward, 5′-GAAGGTGATGCTTGCTGACA-3′, reverse, 5′-CGTTGACGTATTCCATGACG-3′; PKCβ2, forward, 5′-TTCTGTCATTCAAGCGCAAC-3′, reverse, 5′-GTCTGTGAGCCGACATGCTA-3′; PKCϵ, forward, 5′-AGCTGACAACGAGGACGACT-3′, reverse, 5′-CTTCTGCTCCAGCAGTACCC-3′; VAMP2, forward, 5′-TGAGGTTCCCATCACCTCTC-3′, reverse, 5′-CTGTGGGGTTTGCTTTTGTT-3′; SNAP25, forward, 5′-CAACGTGCAACAAAGATGCT-3′, reverse, 5′-GGGGGTGACTGACTCTGTGT-3′; syntaxin 1A, forward, 5′-GAACAAAGTTCGCTCCAAGC-3′, reverse, 5′-ATTCCTCACTGGTCGTGGTC-3′; synaptotagmin 3, forward, 5′-GTGGTTTTGGACAACCTGCT-3′, reverse, 5′-AAACCAGTGAGGTCCATTGC-3′; synaptotagmin 7, forward, 5′-GAGGTGTCCATCCCTCTGAA-3′, reverse, 5′-AGCCACACCTTCACATAGGG-3′; Rab27a, forward, 5′-TTGGAAAGGGGATCAGTCAG-3′, reverse, 5′-TGGCAGTCTCCAGACAAGTG-3′; Rab3a, forward, 5′-AAACCATCTACCGCAACGAC-3′, reverse, 5′-CTCGCTCATCTTCCATGTCA-3′; Munc18-1, forward, 5′-ACTCCGCTGACTCTTTCCAA-3′, reverse, 5′-TGGATCGTCGGCTTTATAGG-3′; Munc13-1, forward, 5′ GATCAAAGGGGAGGAGAAGG-3′, reverse, 5-AGTGGGTCATGGCTTGGTAG-3′; β-actin, forward, 5′-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC-3′, reverse, 5′-CTCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAA-3′. In Vitro Pulldown Assay—Plasmid coding His6-fused Munc18-1 protein (pQE-Munc18-1) (20Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Y. Takai (Osaka University), was transformed into BL-21 cells. His6 fusion protein was prepared as the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose bead (Qiagen, Tokyo)-bound form as described previously (25Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mouse full-length PKCδ cDNA was amplified using RNA from mouse cerebrum by the RT-PCR method and cloned into pBSK vector containing T7 promoter. Then, [35S]methionine-labeled PKCδ protein was synthesized using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Next 25 μlof 35S-labeled protein was mixed with 10 μg of His6 fusion Munc18-1 bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads in a total volume of 600 μl of interaction buffer (40 mm, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 m% Nonidet P-40). Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking, and the beads were washed 3 times with interaction buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 2× sample buffer, fractionated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—HIT cells were cultured as described previously (26Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (27Nomiyama T. Igarashi Y. Taka H. Mineki R. Uchida T. Ogihara T. Choi J.B. Uchino H. Tanaka Y. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Murayama K. Kawamori R. Watada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Anti-PKCα,-β2, -δ, and -ϵ, anti-Munc18-1, anti-Rab3, and anti-SNAP25 antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-syntaxin-1a antibody was purchased from Sigma. To detect phosphorylated Munc18-1 and SNAP25, we collected phosphorylated protein using PhosphoProtein purification kit (Qiagen), which is based on affinity chromatography, a technique that delivers complete separation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins from a cell lysate. Approximately 1000 islets were used to collect phosphorylated proteins as a sample. Then, 20 μg of each sample was used for immunoblotting using anti-Munc18-1 or anti-SNAP25 antibody. Immunoreactivity was visualized and quantitated using Fuji LAS 1000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Data Analysis—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using the unpaired Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. PKCδ-/- Mice Exhibit Glucose Intolerance and Impaired Insulin Secretion—As reported previously (21Miyamoto A. Nakayama K. Imaki H. Hirose S. Jiang Y. Abe M. Tsukiyama T. Nagahama H. Ohno S. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. Nature. 2002; 416: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), PKCδ-/- mice are born normal and fertile with no apparent abnormalities in general appearance or behavior, but they start to develop B lymphocytic autoimmune disease after the age 24 weeks. Body weight of PKCδ-/- mice increased with age, but the gain was modestly lower than that of PKCδ+/- and wild type mice (Fig. 1a). Although fasting glucose level was comparable among the three groups (Fig. 1b), intraperitoneal glucose challenge at the age of 12 weeks identified glucose intolerance with reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- mice (Fig. 1, c and d). The glucose intolerance was continuously observed from 8 to 20 weeks of age, but no obvious deterioration was observed with aging (Fig. 1e). An insulin tolerance test did not demonstrate a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity in PKCδ-/- mice (Fig. 1f). These results suggest that the impaired glucose tolerance observed in PKCδ-/- mice is mainly due to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To search for the mechanism of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release in PKCδ-/- mice, we investigated islet morphology and β cell area by immunohistochemistry. However, we could not find any obvious changes in islet morphology or significant differences in β cell area between PKCδ-/- mice and wild type (Fig. 2, a and b). The insulin content of isolated islets was also comparable (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, electron microscopic analysis demonstrated no apparent abnormalities of β cell and endothelial cells in PKCδ-/- islets (Fig. 2d) (28Lammert E. Gu G. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Brekken R. Murtaugh L.C. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Melton D.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1070-1074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- mice was not associated with any apparent reduction in insulin-containing granules or abnormal β cell morphology. Characterization of Impaired Insulin Secretion in Islets of PKCδ-/- Mice—To elucidate whether the deletion of PKCδ gene in islets resulted in compensatory increases in the expression of other PKC family members, we investigated mRNA and protein expression levels of conventional and novel PKC family members that are known to be expressed in β cells (29Kaneto H. Suzuma K. Sharma A. Bonner-Weir S. King G.L. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3680-3685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, we could not find any significant increase in the expression of PKCα, PKCβ2, and PKCϵ investigated in the present study (Fig. 3, a and b). In further search for the mechanism of decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- mice, we investigated insulin secretion using several secretagogues in isolated PKCδ-/- islets. Insulin secretion stimulated by high glucose was modestly but significantly lower in PKCδ-/- islets than the wild type (Fig. 3c). We further investigated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- islets in a set of perfusion studies (Fig. 3d). The second phases of insulin secretion by stimulation with high glucose (16.7 mm) was significantly decreased in PKCδ-/- islets (Fig. 3e). In addition, insulin secretion in response to depolarization induced by KCl was also reduced in PKCδ-/- islets (Fig. 3c). Arginine, an insulinotrophic agent thought to depolarize β cell membrane to activate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel by its positively charged form (30Hellman B. Sehlin J. Taljedal I.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Blachier F. Leclercq-Meyer V. Marchand J. Woussen-Colle M.C. Mathias P.C. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1013: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), also failed to stimulate insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- islets to levels comparable with those in wild type islets. These results suggest impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- islets after membrane depolarization. Insulin secretion was also significantly decreased in PKCδ-/- islets in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of PKC, and to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and forskolin, activators of adenylate cyclase. Thus, the decrease in insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- islets is observed even after application of various secretagogues. Characterization of Insulin Granules in PKCδ-/- Islets—Next, we determined changes in [Ca2+]i in response to glucose stimulation in single β cells by using fura-2, a Ca2+ indicator. As shown in Fig. 4, the amplitude and time course of a glucose-induced rise in Ca2+ concentration was not different between PKCδ-/- β cells and wild type. These results suggest normal glucose metabolism and ATP production in PKCδ-/- β cells. This finding together with the experiments of insulin secretion indicates that the decrease in insulin secretion in PKCδ-/- islets might be simply due to a decrease in the releasable pool of insulin granules. Thus, to investigate the number of insulin granules that are located close to the plasma membrane, pancreatic β cells isolated from PKCδ-/- mice were immunostained with insulin and visualized by TIRF microscopy. TIRF imaging can identify single insulin granules within <100 nm from underneath the plasma membrane (32Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Counting the number of insulin granules in the obtained image indicated that the density of insulin granules in PKCδ null β cells was not decreased but, rather, was increased (Fig. 5, a and b). To confirm this finding, we counted the relative number of insulin granules according to their distance from the granule center to the plasma membrane in wild type and PKCδ-/- islets after incubation with low and high glucose. As shown in Fig. 5c, the number of granules residing within 100 nm of the plasma membrane was much lower than those located at other distances from the membrane as described previously (33Kasai K. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Takahashi N. Mizutani S. Zhao S. Kikuta T. Kasai H. Nagamatsu S. Gomi H. Izumi T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The number of insulin granules in this fraction was significantly increased in PKCδ-/- islets treated with low glucose. In addition, the number of insulin granules located 100–200 nm from the membrane was increased in PKCδ-/- islets treated with low glucose. On the other hand, the number of insulin granules in other fractions was not significantly different between wild type and PKCδ-/- islets. Probably the increased number of insulin granules close to the plasma membrane reflects the increase in granular backup in trafficking. Next, we investigated the gene expression level of molecules implicated in regulated exocytosis such as Rab3a (34Regazzi R. Ravazzola M. Iezzi M. Lang J. Zahraoui A. Andereggen E. Morel P. Takai Y.

https://openalex.org/W2019611548,"The human C-type lectin-like molecule CLEC-2 is expressed on the surface of platelets and signaling through CLEC-2 causes platelet activation and aggregation. CLEC-2 is a receptor for the platelet-aggregating snake venom protein rhodocytin. It is also a newly identified co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). An endogenous ligand has not yet been identified. We have solved the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of CLEC-2 to 1.6-A resolution, and identified the key structural features involved in ligand binding. A semi-helical loop region and flanking residues dominate the surface that is available for ligand binding. The precise distribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic features in this loop will determine the nature of any endogenous ligand with which it can interact. Major ligand-induced conformational change in CLEC-2 is unlikely as its overall fold is compact and robust. However, ligand binding could induce a tilt of a 3-10 helical portion of the long loop region. Mutational analysis and surface plasmon resonance binding studies support these observations. This study provides a framework for understanding the effects of rhodocytin venom binding on CLEC-2 and for understanding the nature of likely endogenous ligands and will provide a basis for rational design of drugs to block ligand binding."

https://openalex.org/W2081040286,"Phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) has been implicated in tumor cell motility required for invasiveness and metastasis. Diminished tumor dissemination has been demonstrated in xenograft models, but studies in naturally-occurring tumors are lacking, having been limited by the timing of the interventions. Therefore, we generated mice that express a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible dominant-negative fragment of PLCγ, PLCz; this approach avoids the in utero lethality caused by the absence of PLCγ. As we targeted two de novo-occurring carcinomas of the mammary (MMTV-driven polyoma middle T antigen model, PyVmT) and prostate (TRAMP model) glands, we limited expression to these epithelial cells by driving DOX transactivator from the prostatein C3 promoter. This avoids the confounding variable of potentially abrogating motility in stromal and endothelial cells. These mice developed normally in the presence of DOX, except for limited mammary development if treated before 6 weeks and immaturity of the prostate gland if treated before 2 weeks of age. DOX-mediated induction of PLCz from age 8 to 16 weeks in PyVmT mice decreased the number of lung metastases by >10-fold (P<0.06) without a detectable effect on in situ tumor cell proliferation or tumor size. Lung metastases were also significantly decreased in the TRAMP model in which the mice expressed the PLCz fragment (P<0.05). DOX treatment itself had no effect on tumor size or metastasis in control mice, nor did it affect tumor dissemination in nontransgenic littermates. In conclusion, abrogation of the PLCγ signaling pathway can limit the metastatic potential of carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2073914642,"The contribution of different proteolytic systems, in particular calpains and effector caspases, in apoptotic cell death is still controversial. In this paper, we show that during cisplatin-induced apoptosis of human metastatic melanoma cells, calpain activation, as measured in intact cells by two different fluorescent substrates, is an early event, taking place well before caspase-3/-7 activation, and progressively increasing during 48 h of treatment. Such activation appears to be independent from any intracellular calcium imbalance; in fact, an increase of cytosolic calcium along with emptying of the reticular stores occur only at very late stages, uniquely in frankly apoptotic, detached cells. Calpain activation proves to be an early and crucial event in the apoptotic machinery, as demonstrated by the significant protection of cell death in samples co-treated with the calpain inhibitors, MDL 28170, calpeptin and PD 150606, where a variable but significant reduction of both caspase-3/-7 activity and cell detachment is observed. Consistently, such a protective effect can be at least partially due to the impairment of cisplatin-induced p53 activation, occurring early in committed, preapoptotic cells. Furthermore, in late apoptotic cells, calpain activity is also responsible for the formation of a novel p53 proteolytic fragment (approximately 26 kDa), whose function is so far to be elucidated."

Protein kinases are enzymes that serve as key components of signal transduction pathways by catalyzing the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues of proteins. The overexpression or inappropriate expression of normal or mutant protein kinases in mammals has been linked to the development of many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases.Protein kinases can be divided into two classes: those which preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues (protein-tyrosine kinases), and those which preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues (protein serine/threonine kinases). Protein-tyrosine kinases perform diverse functions ranging from stimulation of cell growth and differentiation to arrest of cell proliferation. They can be classified as either receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 2The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor-tyrosine kinase; cABL, proto-on-cogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1; cFMS, macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor; CSF-1, MCSF-1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EphB2, ephrin type-B receptor 2; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; FLT3, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IRK, insulin receptor-tyrosine kinase; JM, juxtamembrane; KID, kinase insert domain; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; PDBID, Protein Databank Identifier; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TIE-2, angiopoietin-1 receptor. 2The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor-tyrosine kinase; cABL, proto-on-cogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1; cFMS, macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor; CSF-1, MCSF-1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EphB2, ephrin type-B receptor 2; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; FLT3, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IRK, insulin receptor-tyrosine kinase; JM, juxtamembrane; KID, kinase insert domain; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; PDBID, Protein Databank Identifier; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TIE-2, angiopoietin-1 receptor. or intracellular protein-tyrosine kinases. The FMS or CSF-1-R proto-oncogene encodes the receptor-tyrosine kinase cFMS (CSF-1-R), which is the cell surface receptor for the (macrophage) colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1 or M-CSF) (1Sherr C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 225-243PubMed Google Scholar). cFMS is part of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor family, which includes PDGFR-α and -β, the stem cell factor receptor (cKIT), and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) (2Robinson D.R. Wu Y.M. Lin S.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5548-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). This family shares a common architecture consisting of an extracellular ligand-binding domain comprised of five immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane segment, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain and a kinase domain divided by a kinase insert domain (KID).Binding of the ligand to the ligand binding domain induces a conformational change, which leads to receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in trans, and activation of the kinase. The phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for a wide variety of signaling molecules through their phosphotyrosine binding domains (3Pixley F.J. Stanley E.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 628-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).CSF-1 is a polypeptide growth factor that stimulates the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells of the monocyte-macrophage series. Multiple forms of soluble CSF-1 are produced through proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound precursors, some of which are stably expressed at the cell surface (4Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 9: 27-44Crossref Google Scholar).Valuable insight into the signaling role of CSF-1 and its receptor cFMS comes from a CSF-1-deficient mouse strain (Csf1op/Csf1op) (5Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W. Bartocci A. Ferrante Jr., A.W. Ahmed-Ansari A. Sell K.W. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4828-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). These mice exhibit a selective reduction of monocytes, osteoclasts, and macrophages in muscle, joint, and other tissues. Furthermore, these mice are osteopetrotic and exhibit reduced fertility, but the incapability to produce functional CSF-1 appears not to be life threatening per se; Csf1op/Csf1op mice are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis and show a reduced rate of mammary tumor progression into metastasis (6Lin E.Y. Nguyen A.V. Russell R.G. Pollard J.W. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Similar, but more pronounced effects, were observed with a mouse model in which the cFMS gene had been inactivated (Csfr-/Csfr-) (7Dai X.M. Ryan G.R. Hapel A.J. Dominguez M.G. Russell R.G. Kapp S. Sylvestre V. Stanley E.R. Blood. 2002; 99: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar).CSF-1 has been shown to exacerbate collagen-induced arthritis in mouse models, an effect that could be suppressed with M-CSF-blocking antibodies (8Campbell I.K. Rich M.J. Bischof R.J. Hamilton J.A. J. Leukoc Biol. 2000; 68: 144-150PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, CSF-1 and GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) induced prolonged inflammation and recruitment of macrophages in an mBSA-induced arthritis model (9Bischof R.J. Zafiropoulos D. Hamilton J.A. Campbell I.K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that CSF-1 and GM-CSF could exacerbate and prolong the histopathology of acute inflammatory arthritis and lend support to the hypothesis that monocytes/macrophages are a driving influence in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. The data shown in these studies suggest that either CSF-1 or its cognate receptor cFMS are suitable targets for treating arthritis or other macrophage-induced inflammatory diseases.In a recent study, expression of cFMS in various tumors was linked to poor survivability and increased tumor size (10Kluger H.M. Dolled-Filhart M. Rodov S. Kacinski B.M. Camp R.L. Rimm D.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CSF-1 and cFMS are also expressed in some types of breast carcinomas and other epithelia of the female reproductive tract, where activation of the receptor by ligand, produced either by the tumor cells or by stromal elements, stimulates tumor cell invasion through a urokinase-dependent mechanism (11Kacinski B.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These results support other preclinical findings that the CSF-1-signaling pathway may be involved in local invasion and metastasis, rendering cFMS a putative anti-cancer target.In this study, we present the structures of two chimeric kinase domains of non-phosphorylated cFMS in complex with two inhibitors. The kinase domain is arranged in the bi-lobal kinase fold typical for protein kinases. Both compounds are competitive inhibitors and occupy the ATP pocket of cFMS. They form a typical kinase binding motif, in which one or more hydrogen bonds to backbone atoms of the hinge region of cFMS are formed. The compounds also prevent cFMS from switching into an active state by preventing the conserved kinase Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif from reaching a productive conformation. To facilitate crystallization, we performed extensive studies on designing the most suitable construct for crystallization, which is outlined in detail in the accompanying article (Schalk-Hihi et al., 33). Additionally, we investigated the structural basis for the partial autoinhibition of cFMS via its juxtamembrane (JM) domain and compared it to the autoinhibitory mechanisms employed by the homologous kinases cKIT (12Mol C.D. Dougan D.R. Schneider T.R. Skene R.J. Kraus M.L. Scheibe D.N. Snell G.P. Zou H. Sang B.C. Wilson K.P. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 13: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning/Protein Purification—The construct design and purification of cFMS have been described in more detail elsewhere (Schalk-Hihi et al., 33). Briefly, all constructs used in the crystallization of cFMS encompass the JM domain and the kinase domain, beginning at amino acid 538 of cFMS and ending at amino acid 922. The chimeras were created by replacing the cFMS KID with the KID sequences from the FGF receptor and TIE2 receptor. For expression in Sf9 cells, a recombinant baculovirus was generated by subcloning the cFMS chimeras into a modified Invitrogen GATEWAY pDEST8 vector. Further steps followed the protocol for baculovirus expression according to the Bac-to-Bac (Invitrogen) manual. cFMS was purified by affinity chromatography on BD Talon resin, TEV protease cleavage to remove the histidine tag, and gel filtration chromatography. The apo form was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml and subjected to crystallization trials. For crystallization trials with inhibitors present, the inhibitors (10 mm in Me2SO) were added to a diluted solution of cFMS (1 mg/ml) and co-concentrated to 7-11 mg/ml.Crystallization and Structure Determination—In a typical crystallization experiment, 1-2 μl of cFMS protein complexed with the inhibitor of interest and concentrated to 7-10 mg/ml was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with well solution (15-28% PEG3350 (Hampton Research), 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0-5.6, 200 mm Li2SO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0-3% glycerol) and placed on a glass coverslip. The coverslip was inverted and sealed over a reservoir of 500-1000 μl of well solution and incubated at 22 °C. Crystals of the complex with compound 1 (arylamide) usually appeared spontaneously overnight; for other complexes, μ-seeding was used to induce crystallization. For data collection, the crystals were quickly transferred to cryo-solution (27% PEG 3350, 100 mm sodium acetate pH 5.5, 200 mm Li2SO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol) and frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100 K on a Bruker AXS MO6XCE rotating anode and a SMART 6000 CCD detector or at the IMCA-CAT ID-17 beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory. The diffraction data were processed with the Bruker Proteum suite or the HKL suite. The initial cFMS structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the FGFR kinase domain (1FGK, (14Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar)) as a search model in CNX. Density modification as implemented in CNX was used to reduce model bias. Structure refinement and model building were carried out according to standard protocols using CNX (15Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S.

Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverview of the cFMS Structure—This structure of cFMS was obtained by utilizing a construct of cFMS, which included the whole JM domain and the catalytic kinase domain minus the C-terminal tail of cFMS. Early protein constructs that represented the kinase domain, including the full KID (residues 680-751), did not yield any crystals. This is probably because the KID is mostly unstructured and interferes with crystallization. A design strategy in which the kinase insert domain was replaced with the significantly shorter KIDs of previously solved RTKs (FGFR, TIE2, and IRK) proved to be successful. We were able to obtain crystals from the cFMS-FGFR and the cFMS-TIE2 chimeras. The cFMS-IRK chimera did not express well and was not pursued further. Choice of the cFMS ligand also proved to be critical for crystallization, because neither apo-cFMS nor nucleotide-complexed cFMS yielded usable crystals. Co-crystallization with the arylamide series inhibitor 1 proved to be a reliable tool for obtaining diffraction quality crystals.The structure of the cFMS kinase domain closely resembles other receptor-tyrosine kinase domain structures in the inactive form determined so far (12Mol C.D.

The protein is organized in a two-lobe structure (Fig. 1A), whereby the N-lobe, comprised of five twisted β-sheets and a single α-helix, is connected to the mostly α-helical C-lobe by a hinge region. The N-lobe and hinge regions are mainly responsible for nucleotide or inhibitor binding and provide part of the catalytic residues, whereas the C-lobe is responsible for substrate binding and catalysis.Nucleotide or inhibitor binding takes place in a deep cleft between the N- and C-lobe. Further important structural motifs are the glycine-rich nucleotide binding loop or P-loop (residues 590-594), the activation loop (residues 796-825), and the catalytic loop (residues 776-783). The native cFMS kinase insert domain (residues 680-751), which has been replaced by the TIE2-KID or FGFR-KID, is located between α-helix-D and α-helix-E and is mostly disordered. The juxtamembrane domain (residues 538-581) loops from the cleft between the N- and C-lobe over the α-helix C to the N-lobe portion of the molecule.Activation Loop—The activation loop is an essential element for the regulation of kinase activity. In RTKs the activation loop is ∼22 amino acids long, begins with a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, and ends with a Pro that is conserved among tyrosine kinases (17Hubbard S.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d330-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of tyrosines present in the activation loop has been shown to be essential for stimulation of activity for RTKs. In the absence of phosphorylation, the activation loop is not properly positioned for catalysis and prevents binding of ATP and/or substrate. Phosphorylation events in the activation loop cause a significant structural change and stabilize a conformation in which the active site is accessible to substrates, and residues important for catalysis are positioned properly.The cFMS activation loop is present in the canonical inactive or closed conformation, examples of which can also be found in FLT3 (PDBID 1RJB) or IRK (PDBID 1IRK). A typical short anti-parallel β-strand, observed in many inactive RTKs, is also present in the structure.Tyr809 is the single tyrosine in the cFMS activation loop and is one of several tyrosines that are phosphorylated in response to ligand binding. Tyr809 is bound in the active site in a manner very similar to that of Tyr1162 of the inactive form of IRK (18Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and Tyr842 of FLT3 (13Griffith J. Black J. Faerman C. Swenson L. Wynn M. Lu F. Lippke J. Saxena K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The phenol group of Tyr809 forms hydrogen bonding interactions with Asp778 and Arg782 of the catalytic loop, which stabilize the inactive conformation of the activation loop.The effect of phosphorylation on this critical residue in the activation loop has been established by several mutagenesis studies. For instance, a Y809F mutation prevents differentiation of CSF-1-dependent bone marrow macrophages into osteoclasts (19Feng X. Takeshita S. Namba N. Wei S. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a rat cell line model, Y809G abolished kinase activity and Y809F reduced kinase activity by 40-60% (20van der Geer P. Hunter T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 4698-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In a previous study, the same Y809F mutation was shown to retain activity as a tyrosine kinase in vitro and in vivo, was able to undergo CSF-1-dependent association with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and induced expression of the proto-oncogenes c-Fos and JunB, underscoring its ability to trigger some of the known cellular responses to CSF-1 (21Roussel M.F. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6738-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mutated receptor failed to induce mitogenesis.The DFG motif in cFMS (Asp796, Phe797, Gly798) signifies the beginning of the activation loop. Asp796 is conserved in kinases, and serves as the catalytic base in the phosphotransfer reaction. Depending on the activation state of the kinase, the DFG motif can be present in two distinct conformations. Activated kinases in a catalytically competent state display the so-called “DFG-in” conformation, in which the aspartic acid points toward the β-phosphate of the bound ATP and helps to coordinate a catalytically important Mg2+ ion. The phenylalanine points away from the ATP and is tucked away under α-helix C. In the “DFG-out” conformation, which is exhibited by cFMS, the aspartic acid and phenylalanine switch sides, i.e. the aspartic acid is pointing away from the location where ATP would be bound. This conformational change renders the kinase inactive.Juxtamembrane Domain—JM domains in RTKs constitute important regulatory elements. The cFMS JM domain corresponds to residues 538-581 3In this article, we refer to the JM domain as the sequence from the first residue past the transmembrane segment to the last residue before β-sheet 1 in the structures. The resulting residue ranges are: cFMS-(538-581), cKIT-(547-588), and FLT3-(564-609). and contains two tyrosines, which upon phosphorylation mediate association of cFMS with partner proteins. Tyr546 was shown to be a major autophosphorylation site and binds to a yet unidentified 55-kDa phosphoprotein (22Joos H. Trouliaris S. Helftenbein G. Niemann H. Tamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24476-24481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A phosphopeptide modeled on the sequence of Tyr561 and surrounding residues competed with the association of Fyn with cFMS (23Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutational analysis demonstrated that this and other sequences were required for the efficient association of Src family kinases with activated cFMS in vivo. In addition to their role as substrates for phosphorylation, the JM domains also serve as autoinhibitory elements for RTKs. Mutations in the JM domain of cKIT and FLT3, for instance, are associated with loss of autoinhibitory function and lead to tumorgenesis. Details of this function were revealed by the recent structures of cKIT and FLT3 (12Mol C.D. Dougan D.R. Schneider T.R. Skene R.J. Kraus M.L. Scheibe D.N. Snell G.P. Zou H. Sang B.C. Wilson K.P. J.

Cell. 2004; 13: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), which belong to the same family of type III receptor-tyrosine kinases. In both structures, aromatic residues of the JM domain protrude into the interface between the N- and C-lobe of the kinase and prevent the DFG motif and the activation loop from achieving a catalytically active conformation. This mode of inhibition differs from the one observed in the case of EphB2 (24Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Cell. 2001; 106: 745-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), where the JM domain forms an α-helix, which distorts the conformation of the catalytically important α-helix C, and prevents activation of the enzyme.Structurally, the cFMS JM domain adopts a very similar arrangement as the JM domains observed in the autoinhibited FLT3 and cKIT kinase structures (Fig. 2). It forms a hairpin-like loop, interrupted in part by disordered residues, and is tightly connected to the interface between the N- and C-lobe. In all complex structures of cFMS with various inhibitors, twelve residues N-terminal to Gln547 do not show any electron density and are disordered. In some of the structures presented in this report, intermediate parts of the JM domain are also disordered; this is in contrast to the FLT3 and cKIT structures in which the corresponding residues could be traced without interruptions.FIGURE 2Comparison of the juxtamembrane domains between cFMS (A), cKIT (B), and FLT3 (C). Proteins are depicted in surface representation. The JM domain was excluded from the surface calculation and is shown as a yellow tube with the thermal displacement factors (B-factors) encoded proportional to the diameter of the tube. Important anchoring residues for the JM domains are depicted in stick representation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is unlikely that the individual lengths of the JM domains are responsible for the observed difference in structural order between the JM domains, because all of them share a similar length. The cFMS JM domain is 44 amino acids long, whereas the FLT3 JM domain (residues 564-609) and cKIT JM domain (residues 547-588) are 46 and 42 amino acids long, respectively. More likely in the case of cFMS, the difference in order can be explained by slight variations of crystal packing from structure to structure. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that the variations of structural order are of biological significance. For instance, one could speculate that the more ordered JM domains bind tighter to the respective kinases and therefore have higher autoinhibitory ability.Residues 548-552 are wedged between the catalytically important α-helix C and a β-sheet like loop region (residues 772-776) just preceding the catalytic loop. Trp550 serves as the main anchor for the JM domain, and its indole sidechain is inserted deep into a cleft under α-helix C. The residue is located in a hydrophobic pocket formed by (Ile636, Met637, Leu640, Ile646, Leu769, Cys774, and Ile794). The indole ring of Trp550 forms a π face-to-edge interaction with His776. The backbone participates in hydrogen bonding interactions with the sidechains of Arg777 and Asp796. Asp796 is part of the DFG motif and signifies the start of the activation loop. The DFG motif is present in the catalytically inactive DFG-out conformation, in which the aspartate points away from the active site and is unable to coordinate the catalytically important Mg+2 ion. The backbone interaction of the carbonyl group of Asp796 with Trp550 stabilizes the DFG-out conformation of the activation loop, and prevents cFMS from obtaining a catalytically competent conformation.Superposition of cFMS onto the structure of the auto-inhibited form of cKIT (PDB-ID 1T45) shows that these structural motifs are closely shared between these two proteins, and to a lesser extent with the homologous FLT3 (Fig. 2). By comparing the autoinhibited form of cKIT with the activated form of cKIT (12Mol C.D. Dougan D.R. Schneider T.R. Skene R.J. Kraus M.L. Scheibe D.N. Snell G.P. Zou H. Sang B.C. Wilson K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31655-31663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), the authors were able to show that the equivalent residue to Trp550 in cKIT (Trp557) prevents the phenylalanine of the DFG motif to switch into a catalytically active conformation by occluding the necessary space. A similar structural comparison for c-FMS is not possible, since no structure of cFMS in the activated form has been reported. On the other hand, based on the close structural similarities between cKIT and cFMS, one can reasonably assume that Trp550 plays the same role as its counterpart in cKIT, and is therefore a crucial element in the autoinhibitory mechanism of cFMS by ultimately preventing cFMS from switching into the active conformation (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Role of the JM domain in stabilizing the inactive form of cFMS. cFMS is shown in a white surface representation, the activation loop (red) and the JM domain (yellow) were excluded from the surface calculation and are represented as red and yellow schemes, respectively.

In the horseshoe crab, stimulation of hemocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes the activation of its innate immune response, and Factor C, a serine protease zymogen, plays an important role in this event. Here, we report that Factor C associates with LPS on the hemocyte surface and directly recognizes Gram-negative bacteria. Structure-function analyses reveal that the LPS binding site is present in the N-terminal cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) region of the molecule and that it contains a tripeptide sequence consisting of an aromatic residue flanked by two basic residues that is conserved in other mammalian LPS-recognizing proteins. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the Cys-rich region specifically binds to LPS on Gram-negative bacteria and that mutations in the tripeptide motif abrogate its association with both LPS and Gram-negative bacteria, underscoring the importance of the tripeptide in LPS interaction. Although the innate immune response to LPS in the horseshoe crab is distinct from that of mammals, it appears to rely on structural features that are conserved among LPS-recognizing proteins from diverse species.

Although the innate immune response to LPS in the horseshoe crab is distinct from that of mammals, it appears to rely on structural features that are conserved among LPS-recognizing proteins from diverse species. Innate immunity, which defends the host against infectious microorganisms, is an ancient and ubiquitous system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Although different organisms employ a variety of environment-specific adaptations to ensure host defense, several generalized features underlie the innate immune response. First, germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 2The abbreviations used are: PRR, pattern recognition receptor; ALF, anti-LPS factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CCP, complement control protein. 2The abbreviations used are: PRR, pattern recognition receptor; ALF, anti-LPS factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CCP, complement control protein. of the host recognize broadly conserved microbial components known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, β-1,3-glucans of fungi, and peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A.

Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). For example, the Drosophila peptidoglycan recognition protein family members and vertebrate Toll-like receptors have been well characterized as PRRs (4Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3911) Google Scholar, 5Dziarski R. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Second, the stimulation of PRRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns activates intracellular signaling cascades that result in transcriptional activation (6Hultmark D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Finally, phagocytosis and the production of antimicrobial peptides by the host are essential for the clearance and killing of infectious microbes (7Lehrer R.I. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 8Stuart L.M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Immunity. 2005; 22: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Hemocytes play a fundamental role in the invertebrate innate immune system both as the initial determinants of non-self-recognition and subsequently as the mediators of phagocytosis, encapsulation, and melanization (9Rowley A.F. Ratcliffe N.A. Ratcliffe N.A. Rowley A.F. Invertebrate Blood Cells. Academic Press, London1981: 421-488Google Scholar). Granular hemocytes predominate in the hemolymph of the horseshoe crab (accounting for >99% of total hemocytes) and constitute a key component of the host defense against infectious microorganisms, as they contain an array of defense molecules that are deployed to protect against infectious microorganisms (10Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Horseshoe crab granular hemocytes are especially sensitive to LPS, a major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. Stimulation of the granular hemocytes with LPS causes the activation of hemolymph coagulation within a few seconds, leading to the immobilization and engulfment invading microorganisms. Hemocytes concurrently release defense molecules by LPS-induced exocytosis, thereby killing infectious microbes (10Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Armstrong P.B. Cohen W.D. Blood Cells of Marine Invertebrate. Liss, New York1985: 77-124Google Scholar). Because of their sensitivity to LPS, it has been thought that granular hemocytes express LPS receptors on their surfaces and that binding of LPS to these receptors could initiate a series of signaling processes important for the innate immunity, as has been observed in vertebrate. A close homolog of vertebrate Toll-like receptors, designated tToll, was identified in the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus. However, the apparent absence of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern binding domain in tToll as well as its relatively nonspecific tissue expression pattern (12Inamori K. Ariki S. Kawabata S. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) cast doubt upon the idea that tToll itself functions as an LPS receptor in horseshoe crab hemocytes. Another candidate for the putative LPS receptor is Factor C, a serine protease zymogen predominantly stored in hemocyte intracellular granules that initiates the hemolymph coagulation cascade following proteolytic activation. Features of Factor C that are consistent with its potential role as an LPS receptor include its high sensitivity toward LPS (13Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Nakamura T. Tokunaga F. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Kobayashi T. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and its restricted hemocyte-specific expression pattern (see supplemental Fig. S1). We recently proposed that a portion of Factor C might localize to the hemocyte surface and undergo autocatalytic activation upon association with LPS, thereby initiating signal transduction via protease-activated receptors coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (15Ariki S. Koori K. Osaki T. Motoyama K. Inamori K. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, we have established the essential involvement of the N-terminal Cys-rich region of Factor C in LPS recognition and determined the importance of a tripeptide motif contained within this region of the molecule. Based on these findings, we propose a mode of LPS recognition by Factor C that employs this motif. Materials—Salmonella minnesota Re595 LPS and biotinylated ultrapure Escherichia coli O111:B4 LPS were obtained from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA) and Invivo-Gen (San Diego, CA), respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated LPS (E. coli O111:B4) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Biotinylation of S. minnesota Re595 LPS was performed with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Pierce). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—One milliliter of T. tridentatus hemolymph was collected into 50 ml of pyrogen-free 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, and the diluted hemolymph (200 μl) was plated on coverslips. After a 20-min incubation to allow attachment, hemocytes were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For LPS treatment, the attached cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml FITC-conjugated LPS for 30 min and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. The cells were blocked with 5% bovine calf serum and incubated for 1 h with anti-Factor C monoclonal antibody 2C12 (16Miura Y. Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Moriyasu M. Yoshikawa K. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) diluted in blocking buffer. For detection, Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used. Cells were imaged with an Olympus BX-FLA fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Cloning and Mutagenesis—To construct Factor C variants with Myc epitope tags, plasmid pMT/FC725, which contains a cDNA encoding the heavy chain of T. tridentatus Factor C, or plasmid pMT/FC410–994, which contains a cDNA encoding the light chain of T. tridentatus Factor C, was used as a template to amplify regions of cDNAs encoding residues 1–723 (heavy chain), 1–296 (Cys/EGF/CCP123), 1–116 (Cys/EGF), 117–296 (CCP123), 300–543 (LCCL/Lectin), 551–609 (CCP4), 669–723 (CCP5), and 738–994 (Ser protease domain) by PCR by using 5′ primers containing a 5′ AscI site and 3′ primers containing a 3′ KpnI site. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the vector pSecTag2A (Invitrogen). Three tandem copies of the Myc epitope tag derived from p5-Helix/3Myc (17Koshiba T. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were then inserted into the 5′ KpnI site (3′ XhoI site) to generate constructs pFC-(1–723)/3Myc, pFC-(1–296)/3Myc, pFC-(1–116)/3Myc, pFC-(117–296)/3Myc, pFC-(300–543)/3Myc, pFC-(551–609)/3Myc, pFC-(669–723)/3Myc, and pFC-(738–994)/3Myc. Mutations (R36E/R38E, K55E/K57E, and W37A) in pFC-(1–116)/3Myc were introduced by standard site-directed mutagenesis (18Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The T. tridentatus ALF gene was amplified from a hemocyte cDNA library using the oligonucleotides TK260 (5′-aaaaaGGCGCGCCcaaggtggtatatggactcaacttgc-3′) and TK261 (5′-tttttGGTACCttgatattgagagatgaacgtttgtgc-3′) to generate an AscI/KpnI fragment that was used to produce a Myc epitope-tagged construct corresponding to those of Factor C. Co-immunoprecipitation—3Myc-tagged Factor C variants and anti-LPS factor (ALF) proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and secreted into the culture medium. HEK293 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% bovine calf serum, respectively, at 5% CO2 and 37° C. Four micrograms of the 3Myc-tagged Factor C variants and ALF expression plasmids were used to transfect HEK293 cells at 50% confluence in a six-well plate using the calcium phosphate method. Conditioned media were collected 2 days after transfection, and the protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Covance, Berkeley, CA). The clarified supernatants were incubated with 3 μg of biotinylated-Re595 LPS (for the E. coli O111:B4 LPS co-immunoprecipitation experiment, 5 μg of biotinylated-LPS was used) at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated 6 h with 20 μl of agarose beads coupled to the anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). After four washes with PBS, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10. Microbial Organisms and Bacteria Binding Assay—Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae, E. coli B, and K12 were cultured in 3% tryptosoy broth at 37 °C overnight. For bacterial immunoprecipitation experiments, 150 μl of the overnight cultures were centrifuged at 12,000 revolutions/min for 2 min and washed twice with PBS. The washed cells were resuspended in conditioned medium from HEK293 cells expressing Factor C variants and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After four washes with PBS, the bacteria were directly resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, and subsequently developed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad). For flow cytometric analysis, Myc-tagged protein bound to bacteria (E. coli K12) were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h and washed twice with PBS, and the FITC-labeled bacteria were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Factor C Is a Membrane-bound LPS Receptor on the Hemocyte Surface—At least two proteins, ALF and Factor C, have been determined to associate with LPS in the horseshoe crab. We recently reported that Factor C, an LPS-sensitive serine protease zymogen, exists on the surface of hemocytes and initiates signaling through heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (15Ariki S. Koori K. Osaki T. Motoyama K. Inamori K. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We reasoned that hemocyte surface-bound Factor C could serve as an LPS receptor, and if so, it would be a likely candidate for the LPS-responsive PRR that induces exocytosis of granular components. To address this issue, we morphologically investigated whether Factor C and LPS co-localize on the hemocyte surface (Fig. 1). Immunostaining of hemocytes with an antibody to Factor C (red) demonstrated that endogenous Factor C was present in a punctate distribution on the hemocyte surface (Fig. 1B, arrows). We next tested whether the surface-localized Factor C could bind to LPS. Hemocytes were incubated with FITC-labeled LPS (E. coli O111:B4). FITC-LPS accumulated on the cell surface of hemocyte (Fig. 1G) and co-localized with Factor C (Fig. 1, H and I, arrowheads). Interestingly, FITC-LPS accumulation was not observed in fixed hemocytes (supplemental Fig. S2), which would be expected to undergo chemical modification and inactivation of surface proteins. These results suggest that Factor C is a membrane-bound LPS receptor in horseshoe crab hemocytes. Factor C can bind to cholesterol and acidic phospholipids with high affinity (14Nakamura T. Tokunaga F. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Kobayashi T. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Ariki S. Koori K. Osaki T. Motoyama K. Inamori K. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) likely through a different site (19Kurata S. Ariki S. Kawabata S. Immunology. 2006; 211: 237-249Google Scholar), suggesting that it might associate with plasma membrane lipid rafts enriched with cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8054) Google Scholar) or microdomains and subsequently initiate signaling processes through protease-activated receptors following LPS-induced autocatalytic activation. Identification of the Factor C Domain Essential for LPS Recognition—We therefore attempted to identify the region of Factor C responsible for LPS recognition. Factor C is a multidomain glycoprotein with an estimated molecular mass of ∼120 kDa. In addition to the typical serine protease domain at its C terminus, it also contains a Cys-rich region, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, five complement control protein (CCP) modules, an LCCL module (derived from a conserved domain of Limulus Factor C, Coch-5b2, and Lg11 (21Trexler M. Banyai L. Patthy L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5751-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)), and lectin-like domains (supplemental Fig. S3) (22Muta T. Miyata T. Misumi Y. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Toh Y. Ikehara Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6554-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed five Factor C variants in HEK293 cells, each containing three copies of the Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) at its C termini, and tested whether these proteins could form a complex with LPS (Fig. 2A). As a positive control, we constructed Myc-tagged ALF, which is known to be an LPS-recognizing protein (23Aketagawa J. Miyata T. Ohtsubo S. Nakamura T. Morita T. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In co-immunoprecipitation assays, both ALF/3Myc and Factor C-(1–723)/3Myc bound to biotinylated E. coli O111:B4 LPS as expected (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). The N-terminal fragment, Factor C-(1–296)/3Myc, also bound to LPS (lane 6). In contrast, constructs that lacked this N-terminal region, namely Factor C-(300–543)/3Myc, Factor C-(551–609)/3Myc, Factor C-(669–723)/3Myc, and Factor C-(738–994)/3Myc, did not bind to LPS (lanes 8, 10, 12, and 14). Consistent with these results, Factor C-(1–296)/3Myc also showed significant binding to biotinylated S. minnesota Re595 LPS to an extent that was similar to that of positive controls (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). We also investigated the specificity of the Factor C-(1–296)/3Myc-LPS complex (Fig. 2C). For both ALF/3Myc and Factor C-(1–296)/3Myc, complex formation with biotinylated LPS was diminished with increasing amounts of unlabeled Re595 LPS, with complex formation completely disrupted by the addition of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled competitor (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6). Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal region of Factor C is sufficient for LPS recognition. The Cys-rich/EGF-like Domain Encompasses the LPS-recognizing Domain—We performed structure-function analyses to further define the LPS-recognizing sequence within the N-terminal region of Factor C. Two fragments of the previously identified LPS-recognizing domain, Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc and Factor C-(117–296)/3Myc, were generated and tested for their ability to bind to LPS (Fig. 3A). Of these two, only the most N-terminal fragment (Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc), which contains the tandem Cys-rich region and EGF-like domain, was capable of forming a complex with biotinylated S. minnesota Re595 LPS (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The interaction between Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc and LPS was determined to be specific, because the complex was disrupted by the addition of excess competing LPS (unlabeled Re595 LPS), as was previously observed for Factor C-(1–296)/3Myc (Fig. 3B). The specific interaction between Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc and LPS was further demonstrated by the inability of either cholesterol or acidic phospholipids to disrupt the complex (Fig. 3C, lanes 3–5). Our results contrast with those presented in a previous study of the Factor C ortholog from the Southeast Asian horseshoe crab Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, which defined a region within the tandem CCP domains as important for LPS binding (24Tan N.S. Ng M.L. Yau Y.H. Chong P.K. Ho B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1801-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, these authors did not specifically investigate the role of the N-terminal region identified in the present study, nor did they include negative controls similar to those described in the following sections. Mutations within the Cys-rich Region Abolish LPS Binding— From the present study, it is clear that the potential LPS recognition domain in Factor C is located in its N-terminal region, which consists of a Cys-rich region and an EGF-like domain. An interesting feature of the Cys-rich region is the presence of a unique conserved tripeptide motif, namely an aromatic residue immediately flanked by two basic residues, which appears in five other known LPS-recognizing proteins (Fig. 4A, bottom). This sequence motif is present in two copies within the LPS-recognizing domain of Factor C from Arg36 to Arg38 and from Lys55 to Lys57 (Fig. 4A, top). To test whether these tripeptide motifs are essential for the LPS binding ability, we introduced paired glutamate substitutions into Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc at locations corresponding to basic residue pairs (Arg36/Arg38 and Lys55/Lys57). The results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the R36E/R38E mutant is incapable of binding to LPS (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 2), whereas the K55E/K57E mutant retains the ability to bind LPS (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 3). We also substituted an alanine residue for Trp37 to assess the importance of an aromatic residue at this position and found that the resulting W37A mutant also lacked the ability to bind LPS (supplemental Fig. S4). These results establish the essential nature of the Cys-rich region for LPS recognition by Factor C and further highlight the importance of the Arg36-Trp37-Arg38 motif. The Cys-rich/EGF-like Domain of Factor C Binds to Gram-negative Bacteria—The preservation of LPS binding activity in Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc allowed us to explore the direct LPS-dependent recognition of live bacteria. Using bacterial immunoprecipitation, we investigated whether Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc could selectively recognize Gram-negative bacteria, which are rich in LPS on their surface. Four types of live bacteria (two Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus and E. hirae, and two Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli B and K12) were incubated with Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc, and the association of the protein with the bacteria was assessed by Western blotting with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10. Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc was specific for Gram-negative bacteria, showing significant binding to E. coli B and K12 but no binding to Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 5A). In addition, the binding of Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc to Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5C). Finally, the R36E/R38E mutant was incapable of binding to E. coli, as judged by both bacterial immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5B) and flow cytometry (Fig. 5C), indicating that the association between Factor C-(1–116)/3Myc and bacteria is LPS-dependent. Implications for Innate Immunity—Factor C associates with LPS on the hemocyte surface, and the N-terminal Cys-rich region can selectively bind Gram-negative bacteria in an LPS-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that Factor C may serve as a membrane-bound LPS receptor capable of tethering invading bacteria to the hemocyte surface (Fig. 6), ultimately leading to hemolymph coagulation by Factor C secreted from granules. We propose that the first conserved tripeptide motif (Arg36-Trp37-Arg38) in the Cys-rich region of Factor C plays an important role in the recognition of LPS, an assumption that is consistent with a modeling study of ALF that predicts direct docking of the corresponding tripeptide motif with LPS (25Pristovsek P. Feher K. Szilagyi L. Kidric J. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 1666-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this model, two lysine residues that correspond to Arg36 and Arg38 of Factor C interact with glucosamine (GlcN) I-1-phosphate in lipid A, and a tryptophan residue, which corresponds to Trp37 of Factor C, interacts with a hydrophobic portion of lipid A (Fig. 6, right panel). Our results are consistent with such a model and underscore the importance of these elements within the Cys-rich region of Factor C for mediating its association with LPS, an essential structural characteristic that appears to be conserved among other LPS-recognizing proteins. Finally, these findings imply that Factor C acts as a PRR for Gram-negative bacteria in the horseshoe crab and lay the groundwork for future studies to elucidate the mechanism whereby hemocyte-bound Factor C potentiates LPS-induced exocytosis degranulation.

It induces cancer cell death mainly through generation of reactive oxygen species by a laser light-activated photosensitizer. It has been suggested that the p53 tumor suppressor protein sensitizes some human cancer cells to PDT. However, there is still no direct evidence for this. We have demonstrated here for the first time that the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) binds to p53 and disrupts the interaction between p53 tumor suppressor protein and its negative regulator HDM2 in vitro and in cells. Moreover, HCT116 colon cancer cells exhibited a p53-dependent sensitivity to PpIX in a dose-dependent manner, as was demonstrated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of cell cycle profiles. We have also observed induction of p53 target pro-apoptotic genes, e.g. puma (p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), and bak in PpIX-treated cells. In addition, p53-independent growth suppression by PpIX was detected in p53-negative cells.

PDT treatment (2 J/cm2) of HCT116 cells induced p53-dependent activation of pro-apoptotic gene expression followed by growth suppression and induction of apoptosis. A variety of stress stimuli, e.g. DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation, trigger cellular responses, such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, in which the p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a crucial role (1Selivanova G.

Academic Press, San-Diego, CA2001: 397-415Google Scholar). In normal cells, the p53 level is very low due to HDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation in which the recently discovered HDM4 protein also plays a role (3Marine J.C. Jochemsen A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 750-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas in stressed cells, p53 accumulates because of disruption of the interaction with HDM2 and induction of growth arrest or apoptosis (4Bond G.L. Hu W. Levine A.J. Curr. Can. Drug. Targets. 2005; 5: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).

Soussi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such tumor cells exhibit an additional mechanism of p53 inactivation mainly via deregulation of HDM2 due to HDM2 gene amplification or loss of p14ARF expression. Rescue of p53 function by inhibition of the HDM2-p53 interaction is currently considered a very promising anti-cancer strategy (4Bond G.L. Hu W. Levine A.J. Curr. Can. Drug. Targets. 2005; 5: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6Lane D.P. Hall P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the HDM2-p53 interaction is expected to induce accumulation of p53 and induction of massive cell death in cancer cells, which are sensitive to apoptosis because of oncogene activation, whereas normal cells should not be affected because of the absence of stress signaling (1Selivanova G. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 8: 1136-1141Google Scholar, 2Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Maruta H. Tumor Suppressing Viruses, Genes, and Drugs. Academic Press, San-Diego, CA2001: 397-415Google Scholar). We have reported recently that the small cyclic compound RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis) is a promising inhibitor of the HDM2-p53 interaction. It can reactivate the tumor suppressor function of wild-type p53 both in vitro and in tumor xenographs in vivo (7Issaeva N. Bozko P. Enge M. Protopopova M. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M. Pramanik A. Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Other examples of HDM2-p53-inhibiting agents are the small synthetic AP peptide (8Chène P. Fuchs J. Bohn J. Garcìa-Echeverría C. Furet P. Fabbro D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the 3G5 HDM2 binding antibody (9Blaydes J.P. Gire V. Rowson J.M. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the peptidic inhibitor bound to GST (10Wasylyk C. Salvi R. Argentini M. Dureuil C. Delumeau I. Abecassis J. Debussche L. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1921-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the recently described small molecule nutlin (11Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D.

We have also shown previously that the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) binds to the tumor suppressor protein Fhit and suppresses HeLa cell growth in a Fhit-dependent manner (12Zawacka-Pankau J. Kowalska A. Issaeva N. Burcza A. Kwiek P. Bednarz N. Pramanik A. Banecki B. Podhajska A.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2007; 86: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have addressed the question of whether PpIX can activate p53 and induce cell death in a p53-dependent manner. Protoporphyrin IX, a heme precursor, is now applied successfully in photodynamic diagnosis and photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Application of derivatives of the heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid causes massive accumulation of porphyrins in cancer cells due to the aberrant heme biosynthesis (13Uehlinger P. Zellweger M. Wagnieres G. Juillerat-Jeanneret L. van den Bergh H. Lange N. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2000; 54: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Photodynamic therapy is at present an alternative treatment of a variety of solid tumors (14Evans H.H. Horng M.F. Ricanati M. Deahl J.T. Oleinick N.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Srivastava M. Ahmad N. Gupta S. Mukhtar H. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7479) Google Scholar). PDT is based on the fluorescent compounds (photosensitizers), laser light of appropriate wavelength, and oxygen present in cancer cells. The excited photosensitizer, selectively accumulated in tumor, activates the generation of reactive oxygen species, which causes cancer cell death via necrosis and/or apoptosis (17Moan J. Berg K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 931-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 18Luo Y. Chang C.K. Kessel D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Brown S.B. Brown E.A. Walker I. Lancet Oncol. 2004; 5: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cancer cell death depends on the chemical properties of the photosensitizer, the light dose, and the genetic background of the cancer (20Dougherty T.J. Gomer C.J. Henderson B.W. Jori G. Kessel D. Korbelik M. Moan J. Peng Q. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 889-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (4723) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been shown that porphyrogenic sensitizers show affinity to receptors of the mitochondrial membrane-PBR (peripheral benzodizapine receptor) and induce apoptosis very rapidly after PDT treatment mainly by releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria (21Kessel D. Luo Y. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1998; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Dahle J. Steen H.B. Moan J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This may suggest that the sensitizers themselves, without laser excitation, can cause cancer cell death. Furthermore, the fact that human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells expressing wt-p53 were more sensitive to Photofrin/SnET2-mediated PDT than the HL60 cells expressing mutated or deleted p53 gene clearly indicates the relevance of wild-type p53 in the response of cancer cells to porphyrin-mediated PDT (23Fisher A.M. Danenberg K. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. Danenberg P. Gomer C.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the cellular mechanisms of PDT action are still poorly understood. The present study addresses the question whether PpIX affects p53 activity and whether p53 plays a role in the PpIX-mediated photodynamic therapy. Cells, Reagents, and Chemicals—The human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells carrying wild-type p53 (p53+/+) and the isogenic HCT116 p53–/– cell line with both p53 alleles deleted by means of homologous recombination were kindly provided by Prof. Bert Vogelstein, Baltimore, MD. LIM1215 cell line stably transfected with p53-dependent lacZ reporter was a gift from Prof. P. Chumakov, Moscow, Russia. Cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (0.1 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin). Because there was no statistically relevant (p > 0.05, n = 9, Student's t test) impact of fetal bovine serum on the uptake of PpIX by HCT116 cells, all experiments were done in medium supplemented with serum (10%). The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere. PpIX was from Sigma-Aldrich reconstituted in 100% Me2SO (Sigma-Aldrich) to 2 mg/ml and stored at room temperature. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen. Viability Assay—The viability of HCT116 colon carcinoma cells after treatment with PpIX and PpIX-mediated PDT was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells (1 × 104/well or 1 × 105/well) were allowed to adhere in 24-well plates overnight. Increasing concentrations of PpIX in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Me2SO) were added to cells for 3 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in fresh medium for 48 h or exposed to the red light generated by the He-Ne laser (632.8 nm, the maximum of PpIX absorbance in Q band) (Department of Acousto-optics and Laser Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland). The cells were further incubated in fresh medium under standard conditions for 18 h. Following the treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with MTT reagent diluted in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (5 mg/ml) at 37 °C. After 3 h, the obtained formazan crystals were reconstituted in 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol. The reduction of MTT by viable cells was measured at 540 nm. Non-treated HCT116 cells and the cells treated with 1% Me2SO in medium or irradiated with the laser light itself were used as a control. The experiments were done in triplicates and in at least three independent experiments. Colony Formation Assay—The cells, seeded as described above, were treated with different concentrations of PpIX in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium for 3 h, trypsinized, and plated in 6-well plates at a density of 400 cells/well. Thereafter, the cells were incubated under standard conditions for 10 days. The obtained colonies were then fixed with 3.4% formaldehyde and stained with Giemsa dye (1% bromphenol blue in 0.4 m borate buffer, pH 8.6). FACS Analysis—Cells were grown in a 25-cm2 dish to 80% confluency, treated with various concentrations of PpIX, and/or irradiated with red light (2 J/cm2). 24 and 48 h post-treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A (0.25 mg/ml), and stained with propidium iodide (0.02 mg/ml). Samples were further analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan. Data were analyzed by the WinMDI software version 2.8. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)—FCS was carried out in ConfoCor equipment (Carl Zeiss) (24Rigler R. Pramanik A. Jonasson P. Kratz G. Jansson O.T. Nygren P. Stahl S. Ekberg K. Johansson B.

The excited and emitted radiation was separated by means of dichroic (Omega 540 DRL PO2; Omega Optical) and band-pass (Omega 565 DR 50) filters. The changes of intensity were detected by an avalanche photodiode (SPCM 200; EG&G) and processed with the digital correlator (ALV 5000; ALV). We used PpIX and His-tagged wt-p53-(1–393) both at concentrations of 2 μm. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (MaxiSorb, Nunc) were coated with 100 ng of His-tagged HDM2 in buffer B (24 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed three times with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and blocked with buffer B with 5% skim milk for 1 h at 4 °C. 100 ng of His-tagged wt-p53 (1–393), glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p53N (1–100), GST-dNp53 (1–63), or GST were incubated with or without 100 μm PpIX in buffer B supplemented with 5% skim milk for 30 min at 37 °C. As a positive control, we used RITA as previously described (10 μm) (7Issaeva N. Bozko P. Enge M. Protopopova M. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M. Pramanik A. Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). After incubation, the samples were applied to the HDM2-coated wells, incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and then washed three times with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, followed by the addition of anti-p53 DO1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:300 in buffer B with 5% skim milk. The plate was further incubated at 4 °C overnight, and wells were rinsed with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (anti-mouse conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) 1:200 (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, plates were washed three times with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and a peroxidase substrate (Pierce) was added. Absorbance was read at a wavelength of 405 nm in a microplate reader. Co-immunoprecipitation—p53 was captured from HCT116 cells or cells treated with PpIX for 3 h with DO-1-coated protein A DynaBeads (Invitrogen). HDM2 bound to p53 was detected by Western blotting using anti-HDM2 antibody SMP14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200. Western Blot Analysis—Following the treatment (PpIX or PDT), the cells (5 × 106) in a 25-cm2 dish were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation at the indicated time points (Fig. 1D) and then subjected to lysis in buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C. The proteins were detected with the following antibodies: anti-p53 DO-1 (dilution 1:500), anti-HDM2 (1:200), anti-Bax (1:200), anti-Bak (1:200), anti-p21 (1:200), anti-PUMA (1:300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin AC-15 (1:1000) (Sigma), and anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies diluted 1:200 (Pierce). As a control, we used cells treated with 1% Me2SO and the cells irradiated with the laser light only. β-Galactosidase Staining—LIM1215 cells stably transfected with the p53-responisive LacZ reporter were treated with PDT for 8 h, washed on dishes with PBS once, and then fixed for 15 min with 1.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Afterward, the cells were washed three times with PBS and stained with 5 mm potassium ferric ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide in PBS with 0.04% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in dimethylformamide and 1 mm MgCl2. The staining solution was left on the cells overnight at 37 °C. To address the question of whether p53 plays a role in PpIX-induced growth suppression, we tested the sensitivity to PpIX of two isogenic colon carcinoma cell lines that differ only in their p53 status, i.e. wild-type p53 expressing HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-null HCT116 p53–/–. The cells were treated with various concentrations of PpIX, and the growth suppression was analyzed using MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, PpIX inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells in a concentration- and p53-dependent manner (p ≤ 0.05, n = 9, Student's t test). To confirm further the p53 dependence of HCT116 susceptibility to PpIX treatment, we performed a long term assay, namely, colony formation. Analysis of the colonies that grew after three hours of treatment with PpIX revealed concentration and p53 dependence of the growth suppression effect of PpIX in colon cancer cells (Fig. 1B). Next, we tested whether growth suppression induced by PpIX is because of cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis. We examined the DNA content of HCT116 cells treated with PpIX using FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells (Fig. 1C). We showed that treatment with 1 or 5 μg/ml of protoporphyrin IX resulted in a significantly higher accumulation of wt-p53-expressing HCT116 cells in the sub-G1 fraction compared with p53-negative cells. This result suggests that PpIX induced cancer cell death in a p53-dependent manner. To further investigate the effect of PpIX in p53-positive and -negative cells, we analyzed the levels of p53 and the products of its target genes using Western blot analysis. We observed the induction of p53 accumulation by PpIX shortly after 30 min of treatment followed by the induction of HDM2 levels (Fig. 1D). This result suggests that p53 induced by PpIX is transcriptionally active, because HDM2 was induced by PpIX in a p53-dependent manner. Both p53 and HDM2 levels oscillated during the 48-h time period, which is in agreement with the published data (28Lev Bar-Or R. Maya R. Segel L.A. Alon U. Levine A.J. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11250-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 29Fu L. Minden M.D. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4392-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Collister M.

Res. 1999; 151: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results show that PpIX induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 (Fig. 1D). It has been shown previously that Ser-15 is phosphorylated by checkpoint ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated protein/ATM- and Rad3-related protein) kinases and that it enhances the p53 transcriptional function (32Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed the induction of two p53 pro-apoptotic target genes Bak and PUMA (Fig. 1D) by PpIX. Induction of Bak was p53-dependent, whereas PUMA was induced in both p53-positive and -negative cells, although with different kinetics. Bax levels were not affected in these cells (data not shown). Neither were affected p21 levels, which is in agreement with the absence of induction of growth arrest by PpIX. Because we observed a p53-dependent effect of PpIX in cells, we addressed the question of whether protoporphyrin IX directly targets p53. To examine the p53-PpIX interaction, we used FCS, previously applied to study p53-RITA and Fhit-PpIX interactions (7Issaeva N. Bozko P. Enge M. Protopopova M. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M. Pramanik A. Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 12Zawacka-Pankau J. Kowalska A. Issaeva N. Burcza A. Kwiek P. Bednarz N. Pramanik A. Banecki B. Podhajska A.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2007; 86: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PpIX was excited with a 588-nm wavelength laser beam (see “Experimental Procedures”), and its diffusion time was detected in the presence or absence of p53 by a digital signal correlator (Fig. 2A). As a result of interaction of PpIX with the target protein, we observed an increase in the diffusion time, which was analyzed by FCS through the autocorrelation function G(τ) of the fluorescence intensity fluctuations. Incubation of PpIX with wt-p53 resulted in a significant shift in the diffusion time, from τD1 = 0.082 ms to τD2 = 49.75 ms. Because the τD2 (49.75 ms) is much longer compared with the τD1 (0.082 ms), it shows that there is an interaction between PpIX and p53. We also estimated that ∼30% of PpIX present in the reaction mixture forms a complex with p53 protein. Next, we addressed the question of whether the binding of PpIX to p53 might affect its interaction with the negative regulator HDM2 of p53. As shown in Fig. 2B, protoporphyrin IX partially blocked the interaction between His-tagged HDM2 and p53 proteins His-tagged wt-p53 (residues 1–393), GST-Np53 (residues 1–100) (Np53), and GST-ΔNp53 (residues 1–63) (dNp53) as was determined by two-site ELISA. Because preincubation of PpIX with p53 for 30 min at 37 °C was required to prevent the HDM2-p53 interaction, it is possible that PpIX binding induces a conformational change in p53, which in turn prevents HDM2 binding. However, the exact molecular mechanism of protoporphyrin IX-mediated prevention of HDM2 binding to p53 remains to be elucidated by further studies. To test whether PpIX can affect the HDM2-p53 interaction in cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay. Results shown in Fig. 2C demonstrate that the binding of p53 to HDM2 is indeed disrupted in cells upon treatment with PpIX for 3 h. Taken together, our results suggest that PpIX binds to p53 and disrupts its interaction with HDM2 in cells leading to p53 accumulation and activation of its pro-apoptotic activity. p53 is a very important prognostic factor in radio- and chemotherapy and, as has recently been shown, also in photodynamic therapy (1Selivanova G.

Previous studies suggest the involvement of p53 in cancer cell death induced by porphyrinogenic mediated photodynamic therapy (33Tong Z. Singh G. Rainbow A.J. Photochem.

Therefore, we investigated the involvement of p53 protein in the susceptibility of colon cancer cells to PpIX-mediated photodynamic therapy. Cancer cells were treated with PpIX in medium and then subjected to laser irradiation (2 J/cm2). The viability of the treated cells was estimated by MTT assay (Fig. 3A). The growth of the control cells was not affected by irradiation with the laser light in the absence of PpIX (data not shown). In contrast, cells exposed to a combination of light irradiation and PpIX exhibited statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05, n = 9, Student's t test), p53-dependent growth suppression. At 1 μg/ml PpIX the fraction of p53-expressing cells undergoing growth suppression (72%) was nearly 14 times higher than that of p53-null cells (5%). At higher doses of PpIX, the growth of both cell lines was inhibited, although p53-positive cells were affected more than p53-negative. Moreover, PDT (2 J/cm2) with protoporphyrin IX induced the wild-type p53-responsive LacZ reporter in LIM1215 cells (40% of β-galactosidase-positive cells for 1 μg/mg PpIX, 23% positive cells for 5 μg/mg PpIX), which demonstrates the induction of p53 transcription transactivation function (Fig. 3B) 8 h post-treatment, and p53-dependent induction of apoptosis was manifested as a strong accumulation of p53-positive HCT116 cells in the sub-G1 fraction upon PDT (Fig. 3C). In addition, PDT also induced apoptosis in p53-negative cells, although less efficiently. Next, we examined the accumulation of p53 and induction of its target genes upon PDT. Fig. 3D shows p53 accumulation and induction of p53 phosphorylated at Ser-15 in PDT-treated HCT116 p53+/+ cells. Induction of p53 was followed by increased expression of its target gene products Bak and PUMA. Interestingly, the level of PUMA was also up-regulated in p53-negative cells, although with different kinetics. Taken together, our results suggest that protoporphyrin IX activates p53 in cells by disrupting its interaction with HDM2 and induces p53-dependent death of cancer cells. However, p53-independent growth suppression is also triggered by this photosensitizer. Also, our studies on PpIX-mediated photodynamic therapy revealed both p53-dependent and -independent cancer cell death. PDT is a novel and very promising anti-cancer therapy. The cellular and molecular responses associated with PDT are only partially understood. In the present study, we have reported for the first time that the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX binds to the p53 tumor suppressor protein in vitro and inhibits the HDM2-p53 interaction in vitro and in cells. The MTT assay with HCT116 isogenic tumor cell lines, which differ in p53 status revealed a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) p53 dependence of inhibition of cell viability after treatment with different concentrations of protoporphyrin IX (Fig. 1A). Further, FACS analysis revealed accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 fraction in a p53-dependent manner after treatment with PpIX. In addition, PpIX (1 μg/ml) caused the accumulation of HCT p53–/– cells in the sub-G1 fraction. It is possible that the induction of p53-independent apoptosis occurs via rapid release of cytochrome c triggered by direct binding of the photosensitizer to receptors on mitochondrial membrane, namely PBR (21Kessel D. Luo Y. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1998; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Dahle J. Steen H.B. Moan J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). We showed the induction of p53 levels after treatment with PpIX. Our data also showed slight phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 accompanying the increase in p53 levels upon treatment with PpIX. Phosphorylation of Ser-15 is known to enhance the interaction of p53 with its transcriptional co-factors (39Thompson T. Tovar C. Yang H. Carvajal D. Vu B.T. Xu Q. Wahl G.M. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53015-53022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed the induction of several p53 target genes upon accumulation of p53. Interestingly, both p53 and HDM2 levels oscillated upon PpIX treatment. Because p53 and HDM2 can regulate each other, our observations are in agreement with previous data (40Lahav G. Rosenfeld N. Sigal A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Levine A.J. Elowitz M.B. Alon U. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). In PpIX-treated cells, pro-apoptotic protein PUMA was induced both in p53-positive and -negative cells, although at different time points. A similar pattern has been observed for PDT-treated HCT116 cells. Puma is one of the p53-target genes and plays a role in mediating p53-induced cell death through the cytochrome c/Apaf-1-dependent pathway (41Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the p73 protein, a p53 homologous nuclear transcription factor (42Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

Yee K. Zong W.X. Corazzari M. Knight R.A. Green D.R. Thompson C. Vousden K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8076-8083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Because p73 is expressed in both HCT116 isogenic cell lines, it is possible that PpIX might also induce apoptosis in a p73-dependent manner. Transcriptionally active TAp73 bears a high homology in its N-terminal region with the HDM2-binding pocket of p53 (46Dobbelstein M. Wienzek S. König C. Roth J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). According to our FCS data and two-site ELISA, PpIX binds to the N-terminal region of p53 and disrupts the HDM2-p53 complex in cells. Therefore, we speculate that PpIX might bind and activate TAp73 protein as well. Further studies are required to investigate this possibility. We also observed that Bak levels are increased in a p53-dependent manner upon both PpIX and photodynamic treatment. Bak, a multidomain protein located at the mitochondrial outer membrane as an inactive monomer, undergoes a conformational change upon stress, which leads to the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria into the cytosol (47Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 8: 903-914Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 48Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T.

Because bak is a known p53 target gene (49Kannan K. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Kela I. Kaminski N. Getz G. Domany E. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), it is possible that p53 released from HDM2 by PpIX might activate apoptosis via Bak along with PUMA. The in vitro examination of the direct binding of PpIX to p53 protein supports our observation that PpIX might disrupt HDM2-p53 complex. FCS experiments revealed the binding of protoporphyrin IX to the full-length wt-p53 protein (residues 1–393) (Fig. 2A) as well as to the p53 N-terminal domain. Because the p53 N-terminal domain contains the binding site for HDM2 protein (4Bond G.L. Hu W. Levine A.J. Curr. Can. Drug. Targets. 2005; 5: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether protoporphyrin IX bound to p53 may affect HDM2-p53 interaction. ELISA assay indeed showed that PpIX inhibits the interaction of HDM2 with both wt-p53 and p53 N-terminal domain proteins (Fig. 2B). Importantly, we observed the inhibition of HDM2-p53 interaction in vitro as well as in cells using co-immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that PpIX does indeed target p53 directly. Interestingly, we have observed a similar mechanism of action for previously reported p53-targeting molecule RITA (7Issaeva N. Bozko P. Enge M. Protopopova M. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M. Pramanik A. Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Our data on PDT-treated cells have revealed the induction of both p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis, as discussed above. p53 accumulates in cells due to DNA damage caused by a variety of factors, e.g. ionizing and UV radiation, alkylating agents, and nucleases (50Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar). Photodynamic reaction activates many signal-transducing molecules, such as fos, jun, and myc. Nevertheless, there is limited data on p53 induction in PDT (33Tong Z. Singh G. Rainbow A.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that PpIX interacts with the tumor suppressor Fhit protein and that its expression in HeLa cells sensitizes the cells to PpIX-mediated photodynamic therapy (12Zawacka-Pankau J. Kowalska A. Issaeva N. Burcza A. Kwiek P. Bednarz N. Pramanik A. Banecki B. Podhajska A.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2007; 86: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we observed that protoporphyrin IX-mediated photodynamic therapy reduces cancer cell viability in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Application of cells stably expressing the wild-type p53-responsive LacZ reporter allowed us to detect p53 activation upon PDT (Fig. 3B). FACS analysis further showed that PDT induces apoptosis in HCT p53+/+ cells more efficiently than in p53-null cells. Western blot indeed revealed p53 accumulation in treated cells and induction of pro-apoptotic proteins PUMA and Bak. In addition, the induction of PUMA and the slight increase of Bak in p53-negative cells support our conclusion that PDT induces both p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis. Our data are in agreement with the previously reported observations that adenovirus-mediated p53 gene delivery enhances the photodynamic response of cancer cells (38Lim D.S. Bae S.M. Kwak S.Y. Park E.K. Kim J.K. Han S.J. Oh C.H. Lee C.H. Lee W.Y. Ahn W.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 2006; 17: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because p53 has several dozen target genes involved in apoptosis, more systematic analysis of gene expression profiles (for example, DNA microarray analysis) is required to elucidate the involvement of p53 target genes in the response of cancer cells to photodynamic therapy with protoporphyrin IX. Identification of the photosensitizer, which can interact with tumor suppressor proteins, thus enhancing the response of cancer cells to photodynamic therapy, provides new insights into the basic cellular mechanism of action of this anti-cancer therapy and opens up new perspectives for the development of better types of therapy.

Recently, however, investigators have begun to explore the development of theoretical databases and algorithms based on virtual liquid chromatography-UV spectroscopy-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra and chromatograms for identifying potential lipid mediators without synthetic or authentic products as standards (12Lu Y. Hong S. Tjonanhen E. Serhan C.N. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 790-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Systems biology approaches include a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the manner in which all the components of a biological system interact functionally over time (13Aderem A. Cell. 2005; 121: 511-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and offer the promise of revolutionizing our understanding of cellular biology, personalized medicine, and drug design. A vital component of a systems biology approach is the global quantification of the spatial and temporal changes in lipid metabolites that occur with cellular metabolism, and no such strategy has yet to emerge. We have begun to address such a strategy using a single cell type, the RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell, and a single stimulus, the high purity saccharolipid Kdo2-Lipid A component of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (14Raetz C.R.H.

Specifically, a set of dose-response and time-course studies was carried out measuring eicosanoid release from Kdo2-Lipid A-stimulated RAW cells. Eicosanoids 3For clarity, it should be noted that “eicosanoids” generally refer to the bioactive mediators derived from arachidonic acid and are active in the picoto nanomolar range in vitro and in vivo (i.e. PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α). These bioactive mediators can be further metabolized to inactive end products (i.e. 15-keto-PGE2) and are then generally referred to as “metabolites of bioactive eicosanoids.” For simplicity, in the present work both the bioactive mediators and their metabolites are occasionally referred to as “eicosanoids.” were detecting employing liquid chromatography coupled with MS and by operating the mass spectrometer in the ultrasensitive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, we had the capability to detect over 70 different eicosanoid and inactivation metabolite molecular species in a single analysis should they be present. Although this method does offer the capability for detecting a large number of diverse eicosanoid species, similarly it carries the limitations of the methods cited earlier (4Margalit A. Duffin K.L.

With our goal being to conduct a global survey of the eicosanoids produced by the stimulated RAW cells, we now address the question: Are biologically significant eicosanoids being overlooked? That is, are there species for which we have no prior knowledge of or expectation of their presence and, hence, no available MRM pairs that would be required for their detection? In the present work, an MS-based general stable isotope exogenous substrate labeling strategy, which we coin “DIMPLES/MS” for diverse isotope metabolic profiling of labeled exogenous substrates using mass spectrometry, approaching a global metabolite survey is illustrated. Herein we demonstrate the DIMPLES/MS approach using one substrate, arachidonic acid (AA), and its RAW cell generated eicosanoids and related metabolites. RAW cells are incubated in medium supplemented with deuterium-labeled arachidonic acid (AA-d8) and then stimulated with Kdo2-Lipid A. Two sets of eicosanoid generation result, one set from endogenous AA, the other from the supplemented exogenous AA-d8. This results in a “doublet” pattern, resolvable with mass spectrometry, allowing for a sensitive and comprehensive eicosanoid search without any previous knowledge or assumptions as to what these species may be, in contrast to traditional methods. Additionally, the AA-d8-generated metabolites exhibit particular mass spectral patterns that may aid in determining possible functional groups and biosynthetic pathways, this being particularly useful when exploring for novel eicosanoids. Although DIMPLES/MS is demonstrated in this work for AA and eicosanoids, its utility should prove equally valuable for other substrates and the diverse analysis of their corresponding metabolites. Using DIMPLES/MS we report herein observing unidentified metabolic products of AA generated by Kdo2-Lipid A-stimulated RAW cells, which have the potential for being novel eicosanoids. If these unidentified species do exhibit particularly interesting and biologically relevant properties, the labor-intensive work required to determine their specific molecular details can be undertaken. Additionally, this approach reveals different detailed biosynthetic pathways for isomeric prostaglandins produced in these cells. Unexpectedly and of particular interest, we report observing a number of 22-carbon 1a, 1b-dihomologue prostaglandins (dihomoprostaglandins), products of adrenic acid (22:4(n-6)) resulting from the two-carbon elongation of AA by the RAW cells. Although previously it has been observed that adrenic acid can serve as a COX substrate when added to cells, resulting in the production of dihomoprostaglandins (15Sprecher H. VanRollins M. Sun F.

Acta. 1985; 837: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), there has been no demonstration of its formation de novo from an arachidonate precursor. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin/streptomycin, the Quant-iT DNA assay kit and the Vybrant Cytotoxicity assay kit were purchased from Invitrogen. Heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). Kdo2-Lipid A (Lipid MAPS ID no. LMSL02000001; Avanti catalog no. 699500) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All the standards used to compile our library of eicosanoid standards, including octa-deuterated AA (AA-d8) used for supplementation, were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Strata-X polymeric sorbent solid-phase extraction columns (catalogue no. 8B-S100-UBJ) were purchased from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA), and the vacuum manifold used with these extraction columns was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). All reagents were chromatography grade and purchased from OmniSolv (Gibbstown, NJ). Tissue Culture and AA-d8 Supplementation—RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage-like cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum with low endotoxin content, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an incubator at 37 °C and 10% CO2. 4 × 106 of these cells were plated in T-25 flasks with 4 ml of the same medium supplemented with and without 12.5 μg/ml (40 μm) of AA-d8 for a 24-h period. Both sets of cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml of Kdo2-Lipid A or an equivalent amount of Me2SO-containing medium as a vehicle control for an additional 24 h. Thus four cell sample types were generated: Kdo2-Lipid A treated with and without AA-d8 supplementation and non-treated with and without AA-d8 supplementation. The cultured medium from each set was then collected, centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g to remove any floating cells, supplemented with 10% methanol, and subjected to an eicosanoid extraction procedure. Eicosanoid/Fatty Acid Extraction Procedure—Solid-phase extraction of eicosanoids and fatty acids was performed using Strata-X polymeric sorbent columns connected to a vacuum manifold. Columns were pre-washed using 2 ml of methanol followed by 2 ml of water. Samples were loaded onto columns, washed with 2 ml of 90/10 water/methanol, then eluted with 1 ml of 100% methanol. The methanol was then evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac, and the remaining sample was reconstituted with 100 μl of liquid chromatography buffer A. Reversed-phase Liquid Chromatography—High-performance liquid chromatography was carried out using two Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) LC-10AD high performance pumps interfaced with a Shimadzu SCL-10A controller. Separation was performed using a 2.1- × 250-mm Vydac (Hesperia, CA) reversed-phase C18 column (catalogue no. 201TP52) equipped with a guard column (Vydac, catalogue no. 201GD52T) held at 35 °C. LC buffer A was water/acetonitrile/formic acid: 63/37/0.02, v/v; buffer B was acetonitrile/isopropanol: 50/50, v/v. Gradient elution was achieved using 100/0, A/B at 0 min and linearly ramped to 80/20, A/B by 6 min; linearly ramped to 45/55, A/B by 6.5 min and held until 11 min, linearly ramped to 28/72, A/B by 11.5 min and held until 16 min, then linearly ramped back to 100/0, A:B by 18 min and held there until 25 min to achieve column re-equilibration. In some cases (details listed later) a second gradient was employed using 100/0, A/B at 0 min and linearly ramped to 25/75, A/B by 16 min and held until 20 min, then linearly ramped back to 100/0, A:B by 22 min and held there until 30 min to achieve column re-equilibration. The buffer flow rate was 0.3 ml/min for both gradients. 10 and 30 μl of sample were injected onto the column using a Leap Technologies (Carrboro, NC) PAL autosampler. The liquid chromatography effluent was coupled to a mass spectrometer for further analysis. Chiral Chromatography—Liquid normal phase chiral chromatography was carried out using the same pumping system described above for reversed-phase chromatography. Separation was carried out on a 4.6- × 250-mm Chiral Technologies (West Chester, PA) derivatized amylose column (Chiralpak® AD-H) equipped with a guard column (Chiralpak® AD-H guard column) held at 35 °C. Buffer A was hexane/anhydrous ethanol/water/formic acid: 96/4/0.08/0.02, v/v; buffer B was 100% anhydrous ethanol. This small amount of water in buffer A is miscible in the hexane/anhydrous ethanol mix and was found to be vital for satisfactory chiral separation and peak shape. Gradient elution was achieved using 100/0, A/B at 0 min and linearly ramped to 90/10, A/B by 13 min; linearly ramped to 75/25, A/B by 15 min and held until 25 min, then linearly ramped back to 100/0, A:B by 27 min and held there until 42 min to achieve column re-equilibration. The chiral chromatography effluent was coupled to a mass spectrometer for further analysis. MS—All mass spectral analyses were performed using an Applied Bioscience (Foster City, CA) 4000 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a Turbo V ion source and operated in full-scan, MS/MS, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes. Details regarding parameters specific to each mode of operation are provided below. For all experiments the Turbo V ion source was operated in negative electrospray mode (chiral chromatography utilized the ion source in chemical ionization mode; see below), and the QTRAP was set as follows: CUR = 10 p.s.i., GS1 = 40 p.s.i., GS2 = 40 p.s.i., IS =–4200 V, collisional activated dissociation = HIGH, TEM = 525 °C, ihe = ON, DP =–30 V, EP =–15 V and CXP =–10 V. The voltage used for collisional activated dissociation varied according to molecular species and ranged from –20 to –45 V. The Turbo V ion source was operated in atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode when employing chiral chromatography using the following settings: CUR = 10 p.s.i., GS1 = 45 p.s.i., GS2 = 60 p.s.i., NC =–3.0 μA, collisional activated dissociation = HIGH, temperature = 400 °C, ihe = ON, DP = –60 V, EP =–15 V, and CXP =–10 V. Doublet Peak-picking Software—Raw mass spectral generated data files (ABI*.wiff) were acquired at an m/z resolution of 0.1 atomic mass unit and then converted to mzXML format (18Pedrioli P.G.A. Eng J.K. Hubley R. Vogelzang M. Deutsch E.W. Raught B. Pratt B. Nilsson E. Angeletti R. Apweiler R. Cheung K. Costello C.E. Hermjakob H. Huang S. Julian Jr., R.K. Kapp E. McComb M.E. Oliver S.G. Omenn G. Paton N.W. Simpson R. Smith R. Taylor C.F. Zhu W. Aebersold R.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) using the mzStar utility (www.sashimi.sourceforge.net/). The mzXML files were processed with a custom in-house program to integrate peaks in each full mass scan over a 0.6-atomic mass unit window and generate a formatted array of quantitated data for each mass spectral sample run. A set of customized Excel Visual Basic macros was then used to load a pair of array files (AA-d8 supplemented and control), perform data normalization and subtractive analyses, view peaks of interest, and generate a list of detected mass spectral “doublets,” according to user-defined criteria. AA-d8 Incorporation—A timeline depicting the supplementation of AA-d8 to plated cells, Kdo2-Lipid A stimulation, medium collection and extraction, and lastly LC-MS analysis is shown in Fig. 1A. The uptake of AA-d8 by RAW cells as a function of time was determined by drawing an aliquot of medium from a plate of cells in 4 ml of medium supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml (∼40 μm) AA-d8 at 0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 18 h after initial supplementation, carrying out eicosanoid/fatty acid extraction, and measuring the relative amount of AA-d8; this was also done for a sample identical to the above, however, containing no cells (control). A comparison of these two measurements permitted a determination of the amount of AA-d8 remaining in the cell-containing medium at the different time periods, and the decrease could be attributed to uptake by the cells (Fig. 1B). LC-MRM-MS/MS (MRM pair of 311/267) was used to determine the relative amount of AA-d8 in the medium, as defined by the area under its chromatographic peak, and its retention time was consistent with a standard. Triplicate samples were measured to determine the error shown in Fig. 1B. Note that at 18 h only a few percent of the initial AA-d8 remained in the medium indicating that by the time of Kdo2-Lipid A stimulation (after a 24-h incubation period) virtually all the AA-d8 was incorporated into the cells. AA/AA-d8 Mass Spectral Doublet—The media from the four cell sample types (Kdo2-Lipid A stimulation with and without AA-d8 (control), and no stimulation with and without AA-d8) were separately collected, extracted for eicosanoids/fatty acids, and resuspended in 100 μl of LC buffer A. A separate LC-MS analysis was performed for each, injecting 30 μl of sample onto the LC column and operating the mass spectrometer in full scan mode (m/z 280–400). The spectrum obtained for the stimulated/control sample (without AA-d8) produced a number of peaks at various m/z values, most noticeably a very intense peak at m/z 351 accompanied by its C13 isotopic peaks at 352 and 353 (Fig. 2A, solid line plot) that had an LC retention time consistent with that of a prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) standard. The intensity of this peak was consistent with our previous Kdo2-Lipid A stimulated RAW cell results (14Raetz C.R.H. Garrett T.A. Reynolds C.M. Shaw W.A. Moore J.D. Smith D.C. Riberio A.A. Murphy R.C. Ulevitch R.J. Fearns C. Reichart D. Glass C.K. Benner C. Subramaniam S. Harkewicz R. Bowers-Gentry R.C. Buczynski M.W. Cooper J.A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 969-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in which PGD2 has repeatedly been an eicosanoid produced in high abundance, typically 50–100 ng/106 cells. A spectrum obtained for the stimulated/AA-d8 sample (Fig. 2A, dashed line plot) contained peaks at m/z 351, 352, as 353 as before, but additionally a peak pattern offset 4–8 atomic mass units up from the 351 peak. Overlaying these two spectra (Fig. 2A) produces a conspicuous “doublet” pattern characterized by the peaks at 351, 352, and 353 present in both the AA-d8 and control samples, and the higher offset peaks at 355–359 present only in the AA-d8 sample and noticeably absent in the control sample. The higher offset peaks have a peculiar distribution shape, different from their non-deuterated counterpart, and we speculate that this is partly due to the actual number of deuterium atoms present on the deuterated-AA molecule used for supplementation; Fig. 1C shows the molecular structure of deprotonated AA-d8 and the location of its deuterium atoms. A direct-infusion (sample was not run through an LC column) mass spectral analysis of the AA-d8 stock solution used for the supplementation shows a portion of the molecules contained not only the maximal 8 deuterium atoms, but 7 (AA-d7) and 6 (AA-d6) as well in the ratio of ∼65%, 30, and 5%, respectively (Fig. 1D). This ratio was determined using the integrated area under the three peaks, and any C13 contribution was ignored in this estimation. It is additionally noted that when the deuterated-AA was placed in cell medium (with serum) for a 48-h period, this produced no noticeable change in its deuterium atom containing distribution (data not shown). It is important to note that, while the majority of the supplemented deuterated AA contains 8 deuterium atoms, the majority of the generated PGD2 contains 6 deuterium atoms (PGD2+d6, m/z = 357, Fig. 2A). The formation of a ketone group on C-11 of PGD2 (Fig. 2B) requires the loss of a deuterium atom from this position of its AA-d8 precursor (Fig. 1C); however, because the peak at m/z = 357 in Fig. 2A (PGD2+d6) is so strongly present it is likely that another deuterium atom is being lost from AA-d8 during its conversion into PGD2, i.e. from C-8, C-12, C-15, or any of the other four remaining locations. It should be noted, however, that, because the peak at m/z 358 in Fig. 2A is present at a higher level than can be accounted for solely from a C13 isotopic contribution, PGD2+d7 is also formed (if the peak at m/z = 358 was solely due to a C13 contribution one would expect its intensity to be ∼20% the intensity observed in the peak at m/z = 357). Therefore, the loss of this second deuterium atom appears to not be an absolute occurrence, as is the C-11 deuterium atom loss, but a loss that occurs a significant portion of the time during the AA-d8 conversion to PGD2. Comparison of the two non-stimulated cell sample types (with/without AA-d8 supplementation) shows a similar pattern as described above, the doublet pattern in the AA-d8-supplemented sample compared with a major single peak at m/z 351, accompanied by its C13 isotopic peaks, in the non-supplemented sample. These were at basal levels in both samples, roughly 100-fold below stimulated intensity levels, a trend that has been previously observed (14Raetz C.R.H. Garrett T.A. Reynolds C.M. Shaw W.A. Moore J.D. Smith D.C. Riberio A.A. Murphy R.C. Ulevitch R.J. Fearns C. Reichart D. Glass C.K. Benner C. Subramaniam S. Harkewicz R. Bowers-Gentry R.C. Buczynski M.W. Cooper J.A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 969-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This would indicate that the AA-d8 supplementation per se does not noticeably up-regulate eicosanoid production in the cell. Fig. 3 (A–D) shows the profiles generated during an LC-full mass scan for some of the other known eicosanoids produced by the AA-d8 supplemented, Kdo2-Lipid A-stimulated cells. It should be noted that for some of these metabolites (i.e. PGF2α and 11-HETE) the most abundant AA-d8-generated products contain 8 deuterium atoms, whereas for others (PGD2, PGE2, and 11β-PGF2α) 6 deuterium atoms are contained in the most abundant product. The significance of these differences is addressed under “Discussion.” Chiral chromatography (19Lee S.H. Williams M.V. Blair I.A. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2005; 77: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) coupled to MRM mass spectrometry showed the 11-HETE species to be exclusively 11(R)-HETE (Fig. 4, A and B).FIGURE 4Chiral chromatography confirms exclusive 11(R)-HETE production.

In addition, B. thuringiensis crystal proteins are now also being explored for their possible use in the control of nematode parasites (7Wei J.Z. Hale K. Carta L. Platzer E. Wong C. Fang S.C.

Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four of these bre genes have been cloned and characterized. These genes, bre-2, bre-3, bre-4, and bre-5, encode glycosyltransferase genes that catalyze the addition of monosaccharides onto invertebrate-specific glycolipids (10Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11Griffitts J.S. Haslam S.M. Yang T. Garczynski S.F. Mulloy B. Morris H. Cremer P.S. Dell A.

The resulting oligosaccharide chain is a receptor for the Cry protein (11Griffitts J.S. Haslam S.M. Yang T. Garczynski S.F. Mulloy B. Morris H. Cremer P.S. Dell A. Adang M.J. Aroian R.V. Science. 2005; 307: 922-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, loss of any one of these genes results in loss of the receptor for the toxin and a high level of resistance.Here we clone the fifth bre gene, bre-1, and characterize its phenotype. bre-1 mutant animals are resistant to Cry5B but at a lower level than the other bre mutants. Mutation of the bre-1 gene comes at a significant cost to the animal and includes a small brood size at 25 °C. bre-1 encodes a protein with significant homology to GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD), a cytosolic enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose. This inferred enzymatic function is supported by fucose rescue experiments that also demonstrate that C. elegans lacks an alternative pathway for production of GDP-fucose, the fucose salvage pathway. bre-1 mutant animals show qualitative and quantitative defects in the production of glycolipid receptors for Cry5B, explaining its resistance phenotype. bre-1 mutant animals have overall very low levels of fucose and appear to be lacking fucosylated N- and O-glycans. C. elegans can evidently survive with little protein fucosylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESC. elegans Maintenance and Microscopy—C. elegans N2 and other strains were maintained on standard NG plates spread with the Escherichia coli strain OP50 (13Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). bre-1(ye4) was outcrossed six times to N2 prior to the work conducted here. All nematode assays were carried out at 20 °C unless otherwise noted. Nematodes were mounted for microscopy on 2% agarose pads with 0.1% sodium azide. Images were acquired using an Olympus BX60 microscope using the ×10 objective linked to a ×0.5 camera mount and a DVC Co. camera.Brood Size Assay—L4 stage worms from N2 and bre-1(ye4) were picked one each to three plates and incubated at 25 °C for 24-h periods. After each period, the originally picked worms would be picked to a new plate. Progeny from the original parent worms were allowed to grow an additional 24 h at 25 °C before they were counted. This process was continued every 24 h until the original parents ceased to produce additional progeny. The results for this assay include three independent replicates (total of nine worms).Cloning bre-1(ye4)—bre-1(ye4) was mapped between unc-24(e138) and dpy-20(e1282) using standard three-factor mapping. An unc-24(e138)bre-1(ye4)dpy-20(e1282) triple mutant was then made in order to perform single nucleotide polymorphism mapping with the Hawaiian strain (CB4856) (14Wicks S.R. Yeh R.T. Gish W.R. Waterston R.H. Plasterk R.H. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Single nucleotide polymorphism mapping narrowed the search to a region covered by three cosmids (D1046, C53B4, and C53D6). Purified cosmid from the three cosmid strains were injected with the rol-6 marker (pRF4) into bre-1(ye4) young adults. All injection experiments were performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope using an Eppendorf microinjector. rol-6 alone was used to inject N2 and bre-1 worms to control for any other possible phenotypes produced by this marker. These controls showed no deviation from expected phenotypes. Stable lines obtained from injections were tested for rescue from resistance to Cry5B by plating onto NG plates containing 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin spread with E. coli strain JM103 with a pQE9 vector expressing a form of the Cry5B toxin called Cry5Bm. Cry5Bm is a slightly attenuated form of Cry5B that contains two mutations in the toxin domain (N172I and E248K). bre-1 mutant animals (as well as bre-2, -3, -4, and -5 mutant animals) are resistant to both wild type and attenuated forms of Cry5B. However, because the level of resistance of bre-1 mutant animals is lower than that of the other bre mutants, we found it simpler to score bre-1 resistance using attenuated Cry5Bm when the number of worms to assay was limited, i.e. following injections for RNAi and following injections for sugars rescue experiments (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3).FIGURE 3bre-1(ye4) resistance to Cry5B can be rescued with GDP-fucose. A, N2 (wild type) control worms plated at a life stage similar to injected bre-1 and bre-2 worms. B-E, bre-1 or bre-2 worms injected with fucose or GDP-fucose before being plated on empty vector E. coli (left panels, no toxin) or E. coli expressing Cry5Bm (right panels, toxin). The injected worms did not exhibit a reduction in overall health as a result of injection trauma (see no toxin panels). Injection of GDP-fucose into the intestine of bre-1(ye4) animals is the only condition tested that restores wild-type susceptibility to toxin (compare right panels in C to right panels in A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After finding C53B4 as the only one of the three cosmids capable of rescuing the bre-1 phenotype (6/6 lines), each of the open reading frames from the cosmid were PCR-amplified, using the primers listed in Table 1, and tested for their ability to rescue bre-1(ye4) as described above. C53B4.7 was found to be the only gene capable of rescue (8/8 lines). For final rescue experiments, animals were placed on a isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside/carbenicillin NG plate spread with a 60/40 dilution of E. coli expressing Cry5B(without mutation):E. coli transformed with vector alone. cDNA was isolated from total bre-1(ye4) RNA and used for sequencing the bre-1(ye4) gene. SL-1 was used as the leading primer for 5′ sequencing, and oligo(dT) was used as the reverse primer for 3′ sequencing.TABLE 1Primers used to create PCR constructs for bre-1 rescue experimentsGenePrimer 1 locationPrimer 2 locationOpen reading frameUpstreamDownstreamkbkbkbC53B4.1IV 8967784IV 89736942.30.343.1cgtcgagatggaagatgaagtattcgactaggattccccaattgatttcC53B4.2IV 8964987IV 89682281.71.10.34catttaaaaggacttggaccacaacaaaatgtccgtgcaaagtcaC53B4.3IV 8968814IV 89756802.322ggcctaaatgggtgattttcaatggcccactcaatttcctgaaC53B4.4IV 8970446IV 898550910.43.10.75gaaaatgattggacaaacgaatgatgtagtgtgccctgaatgtttgattC53B4.5IV 8976751IV 89818290.922caatattccaggcttcaccaccggagttgatggtgttgcatttgC53B4.6IV 8984094IV 89872461.80.750.59gcccattcctaaatgttttcttattcattttgatcagccatttttactctC53B4.7IV 8986609IV 89932293.00.62.9ccgcatttgttttcattggagaccaaccacaaatacaaagctactC53B4.9IV 8992651IV 89955300.1222gggcgcgagtaggactaattataaagaacatttcttttcactctcttctttctt Open table in a new tab Cry5B Lethal Concentration Assay—Cry5B was purified from B. thuringiensis using a sucrose gradient as described (15Cappello M. Bungiro R.D. Harrison L.M. Bischof L.J. Griffitts J.S. Barrows B.D. Aroian R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15154-15159Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) just prior to setting up the lethality assay. The Cry5B lethality assay was performed as described (16Bischof L.J. Huffman D.L. Aroian R.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 351: 139-154PubMed Google Scholar). Cry5B was tested with N2 and bre-1(ye4) worms at the L4 stage using a range of Cry5B from 0.312 to 120 μg of Cry5B/ml. Worm viability was scored after 8 days at 20 °C. Each individual assay was set up in triplicate for each concentration of Cry5B. Three independent individual assays were performed. Probit analysis (17Finney D.J. Probit Analysis. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1971: 333Google Scholar) was used to calculate the lethal concentration (LC) of Cry5B that killed 50 and 90% of the worms (LC50 and LC90, respectively). The mean values from the individual assays were compared using a paired t test to determine statistical significance. A probability value of less than 0.05 was set as significant. For graphical representation of the lethality assays, a nonlinear regression analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego).RNA-mediated Interference (RNAi) by Injection—20 rrf-3(pk1426) L4 worms were plated and incubated 12 h for each of the injection samples. After the 12-h incubation, 10 worms were injected for each of the injection samples. Injections were performed as described previously. Each injected worm was plated individually and allowed 24 h of recovery time at 15 °C. At this point the worms were transferred to new individual plates and incubated at 20 °C for an additional 24 h. Progeny obtained more than 48 h after injection were allowed to grow to the L4 stage at which point 20 were transferred to plates seeded with E. coli expressing Cry5Bm. After an additional 48 h, the response to toxin was observed. In addition, three L4 worms were picked out to individual plates for each injection sample and tested for brood size. The brood size assay was performed as described above. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) fragments were made from RNA purified from N2 worms. The dsRNA fragments were amplified using T7-linked primers (see Table 2) with an Ambion T7 polymerase kit. dsRNAs were injected at a concentration of 2 mg/ml.TABLE 2Primers used to prepare dsRNA from bre-1 and F56H6.5 for RNAi injection experimentsGenePrimer 1 locationPrimer 2 locationPCR productkbC53B4.7IV 8987281IV 89902191.230taatacgactcactatagggtaatacgactcactatagggatgcgaaaattgagggtcttgatgtcgcttgcaaccatctctF56H6.5I 12292533I 122923150.235taatacgactcactatagggtaatacgactcactatagggggtttgggaaggcgaaggtgtcgctagccaccatttctttgac Open table in a new tab Fucose Rescue Experiments—12 worms were injected for each sugar. bre-1(ye4) and bre-2(ye31) L4 worms were injected with 2.5 mm solutions of either l-fucose (F1395; Sigma) or GDP-β-l-fucose (371443; Calbiochem) in water. All of the injected worms were then transferred to NG OP50 plates and allowed to recover for 2 h at 15°C. After recovery, eight worms were transferred to Cry5Bm toxin plates prepared as described above. The other four worms were transferred to similar plates spread with the same strain of bacteria with an empty vector. After 48 h worms were mounted and imaged as described above. This experiment was independently repeated three times.Preparation of Lipids and TLC Analyses—Lipids were prepared, separated by TLC, and probed with biotinylated Cry5B as described (11Griffitts J.S. Haslam S.M. Yang T. Garczynski S.F. Mulloy B. Morris H. Cremer P.S. Dell A. Adang M.J. Aroian R.V. Science. 2005; 307: 922-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 18Schnaar R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 348-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Ulex europaeus Fucose-binding Lectin Overlay—Plates of resolved glycolipids were fixed with polyisobutylmethacrylate and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% Tween 20 for 30 min. After blocking, the plate was washed for 1 min and again for 5 min with a tissue-staining buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl). The plate was then probed with a 10 μg/ml solution of biotinylated U. europaeus lectin (B-1065; Vector Laboratories) in tissue staining buffer for a period of 2 h. The remaining steps are the same as those performed for the Cry5B overlay experiments (11Griffitts J.S. Haslam S.M. Yang T. Garczynski S.F. Mulloy B. Morris H. Cremer P.S. Dell A. Adang M.J. Aroian R.V. Science. 2005; 307: 922-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).Analysis of Glycolipid Affinity for Cry5B—Glycolipids were purified as described (11Griffitts J.S. Haslam S.M. Yang T. Garczynski S.F. Mulloy B. Morris H. Cremer P.S. Dell A. Adang M.J. Aroian R.V. Science. 2005; 307: 922-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) from mixed stage worm pellets in which the total number of worms was quantitated by sampling worm quantities in several small aliquots. Upper phase glycolipids were dissolved in a solution of 1/1 (methanol:water). Solution volumes, representative of a specific number of worms, were then transferred to a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate (Costar 9017, medium binding). This solution was allowed to evaporate at room temperature for a period of 135 min. Any remaining solution was removed and replaced with blocking solution (42 mm Na2HPO4, 85 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2% defatted bovine serum albumin) and allowed to block for 30 min. The wells were then probed with 22 nm elastase-activated, biotinylated Cry5B in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cry5B protoxin was activated and labeled as described (11Griffitts J.S. Haslam S.M. Yang T. Garczynski S.F. Mulloy B. Morris H. Cremer P.S. Dell A. Adang M.J. Aroian R.V. Science. 2005; 307: 922-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The wells were then washed twice with blocking buffer and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase solution in blocking buffer for 45 min. Wells were washed twice with bovine serum albumin-free block solution and once with water. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (PnPP) was then added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PnPP buffer (50 mm HCO3, 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 10)). After positive control wells reached an A405 of 1, 3 m NaOH was added to each well to stop the color reaction. Three control wells were used to determine the A405 at three 10-min time points (10, 20, and 30 min) during the PnPP incubation. Control wells generally reached an A405 of 1 after 30 min with PnPP. A405 measurements were then taken for all wells. Background was determined by setting up duplicate wells with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled activated toxin for all worm numbers. Each condition was represented by three wells in each of three replicates.Monosaccharide Analysis of Worm Pellets—Large populations of worms were grown on 100-mm ENG plates spread with E. coli strain OP50. Before the populations starved, they were washed from the plates with water and transferred to a Falcon tube producing a pellet volume of ∼1 ml. Collected worm pellets were washed eight times with water. Pellets were then treated using standard protocols (40Dionex Corp. Analysis of Carbohydrates by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAE-PAD). 1993; (Technical Note 20): 1-12Google Scholar).Structural Analysis of Glycoproteins—Worm pellets were acquired as described above under “Monosaccharide Analysis of Worm Pellets.” The worm pellets were sonicated in an extraction buffer consisting of 0.5% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4). Material for analysis was extracted for an additional 24 h on a rocker at 4 °C. Solid debris was removed by centrifugation at 1400 × g for 10 min. Detergent was removed by extensive dialysis against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.6). After dialysis the samples were lyophilized. Reduction and protection of the disulfide bridges of the extracted proteins were carried out as described (19Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The reduced carboxymethylated proteins were trypsinized and digested with PNGase F (EC 3.5.1.52; Roche Applied Science) as described (20Morelle W. Haslam S.M. Olivier V. Appleton J.A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glycopeptides remaining after PNGase F digestion were further digested with PNGase A (EC 3.5.1.52; Roche Applied Science), in ammonium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.0), for 16 h at 37 °C using 0.2 milliunits of the enzyme. The reaction was terminated by lyophilization, and the products were purified on a C18 cartridge. O-Linked oligosaccharides were liberated from glycopeptides after PNGase F and A digestion by reductive elimination (400 μl of 1 m NaBH4 in 0.05 m NaOH at 45 °C for 16 h) and desalted through a Dowex 50W-X8(H) column. Excess borates were removed by coevaporation with 10% (v/v) acetic acid in methanol under a stream of nitrogen.Chemical Derivatization for MALDI-MS—Permethylation using the sodium hydroxide procedure was performed as described (19Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). After derivatization, the reaction products were purified on a Sep-Pak C18 (Waters) as described (19Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). MALDI data were acquired using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DETM STR mass spectrometer in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction. Derivatized glycans were dissolved in 10 μl of methanol, and 1 μl of dissolved sample was premixed with 1 μl of matrix (2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid) before loading onto a target plate.Structural Analysis of Freed Glycans from Glycosphingolipid—Upper phase glycosphingolipids were collected from bre-1 worms as described under “Preparation of Lipids and TLC Analyses.” Upper phase glycosphingolipid head groups were enzymatically released as described (11Griffitts J.S. Haslam S.M. Yang T. Garczynski S.F. Mulloy B. Morris H. Cremer P.S. Dell A. Adang M.J. Aroian R.V. Science. 2005; 307: 922-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Pure bre-1 glycans in water were then lyophilized, permethylated, and analyzed by MALDI-MS as described above.RESULTSA single allele of bre-1, bre-1(ye4), was isolated in genetic screens for C. elegans mutants resistant to Cry5B toxin made by the invertebrate Gram-positive pathogen B. thuringiensis (9Marroquin L.D. Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the same screens, multiple mutant alleles in each of four other genes, bre-2, -3, -4, and -5, were also isolated. Resistance of bre-1(ye4) animals relative to wild-type animals can be readily seen at a 60% dose of Cry5B-expressing E. coli (Fig. 1, A and B). As demonstrated previously (9Marroquin L.D. Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resistance of bre-1 mutant animals is less than that of animals mutant for the other four bre genes, such as bre-2 (Fig. 1C). Based on LC90 and LC50 values, bre-1(ye4) mutant animals are 3.2- and 2.2-fold, respectively, more resistant to purified Cry5B than wild type (Fig. 1D; p = 0.036 for LC90 and 0.0173 for LC50). bre-1(ye4) mutant animals also produce small brood sizes at 25 °C (Table 3). There thus appears to be a steeper cost to the nematode for mutation of the bre-1 gene when compared with most of the other bre mutants (Table 3). Interestingly, bre-3 mutant animals also display low progeny production at 25 °C (Table 3). The lower level of resistance and the brood size defects associated with the bre-1 mutant suggested that the bre-1 gene could encode a protein that is dissimilar to the four other bre genes, all of which encode glycosyltransferases.FIGURE 1bre-1(ye4) animals are resistant to Cry5B. A-C, left panels, L4 worms from each strain after feeding on E. coli transformed with an empty vector and pictured at 48 h. A-C, right panels, worms from each strain pictured after 48 h on toxin plates, which were spread with a mixed culture consisting of 60% E. coli expressing Cry5B and 40% E. coli transformed with an empty vector.

All three cosmids were injected into bre-1(ye4) animals, and only one, C53B4, resulted in rescue of bre-1 resistance to toxin phenotype. Injection of PCR fragments that contain all open reading frames, including their putative promoters and 3′-untranslated regions on C53B4, identified C53B4.7 as the only rescuing gene (Fig. 2A). Further confirmation that C53B4.7 and bre-1 are synonymous is provided by the following facts: 1) injection of double-stranded C53B4.7 RNA into rrf-3(pk1426) animals recapitulates the bre-1 resistance to toxin phenotype (Fig. 2B; rrf-3(pk1426) animals show normal response to Cry5B (21Huffman D.L. Abrami L. Sasik R. Corbeil J. van der Goot F.G. Aroian R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10995-11000Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and are more sensitive to dsRNA), and 2) bre-1(ye4) animals show a mutation of Gly217 to Glu in the C53B4.7 open reading frames (Fig. 2C). Injection of the C53B4.7 fragment also rescues the reduced brood size phenotype associated with bre-1(ye4) (not shown).bre-1 encodes a putative enzyme with significant homology to GMD. This enzyme has been characterized in humans as working upstream of GDP-keto-6-deoxymannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase (FX protein) to convert GDP-mannose into GDP-fucose (22Sullivan F.X. Kumar R. Kriz R. Stahl M. Xu G.Y. Rouse J. Chang X.J. Boodhoo A. Potvin B. Cumming D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8193-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Human GMD maintains 64% amino acid identity to the BRE-1 protein (Fig. 2C). Wormbase shows two alternatively spliced variants for bre-1, C53B4.7a and C53B4.7b. We confirmed both of these variants by sequencing reverse transcription-PCR products from wild-type RNA. C53B4.7b is 15 amino acids longer than C53B4.7a at its N terminus, and the first eight amino acids of C53B4.7a differ as well. Otherwise, starting at amino acid 9 for C53B4.7a and 24 for C53B4.7b, the protein sequences are the same. The bre-1(ye4) mutation results from a base pair change in exon 4 and affects both splice variants of the gene. The glycine that is converted to glutamic acid in ye4 is conserved in GMDs from other organisms (e.g. E. coli, Arabidopsis, and humans) and is located in helix 7, which is very close to the predicted catalytic domains of the GMD protein (23Somoza J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2032123758,"Senescence is a permanent growth arrest that restricts the lifespan of primary cells in culture, and represents an in vitro model for aging. Senescence functions as a tumor suppressor mechanism that can be induced independent of replicative crisis by diverse stress stimuli. RNase-L mediates antiproliferative activities and functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, therefore, we examined a role for RNase-L in cellular senescence and aging. Ectopic expression of RNase-L induced a senescent morphology, a decrease in DNA synthesis, an increase in senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, and accelerated replicative senescence. In contrast, senescence was retarded in RNase-L-null fibroblasts compared with wild-type fibroblasts. Activation of endogenous RNase-L by 2-5A transfection induced distinct senescent and apoptotic responses in parental and Simian virus 40-transformed WI38 fibroblasts, respectively, demonstrating cell type specific differences in the antiproliferative response to RNase-L activation. Replicative senescence is a model for in vivo aging; therefore, genetic disruption of senescence effectors may impact lifespan. RNase-L-/- mice survived 31.7% (P<0.0001) longer than strain-matched RNase-L+/+ mice providing evidence for a physiological role for RNase-L in aging. These findings identify a novel role for RNase-L in senescence that may contribute to its tumor suppressive function and to the enhanced longevity of RNase-L-/- mice."

Here we study the formation of transcription complexes at stable reporters under the control of an inducible Tet-VP16 activator in living cells. In this simplified model for gene activation VP16 recruits the general factors and the cofactors Mediator, GCN5, CBP, and PC4, within minutes to the promoter region. Activation is accompanied by only minor changes in histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation but induces a marked promoter-specific increase in H3K79 methylation. Mediated through contacts with VP16 several subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPSF/CstF) are concentrated at the promoter region. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that VP16 activates transcription through a specific MED25-associated Mediator, which is deficient in CDK8.

The herpes simplex virus-encoded protein VP16 is a potent activator that controls the transcription of immediate early viral genes through the interaction with host cell factors (1Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). VP16 harbors a strong activation domain that functions well in both yeast and human cells when tethered to independent DNA-binding domains (2Cousens D.J. Greaves R. Goding C.R. O'Hare P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2337-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M.

Based on these properties, fusion proteins of VP16 with GAL4 or DNA-binding domains of other transactivators have been widely used as models to investigate the basic principles of transcription activation.

Furthermore, VP16 stimulates open complex formation, which relates to interactions with the p62 subunit of TFIIH and the general cofactor PC4 (10Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M.

Comparative binding studies and functional experiments pointed to a key role for the cofactors CBP, STAGA/TFTC, and Mediator (11Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32875-32882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CBP interacts specifically with the C-terminal (H2) region of VP16, whereas Mediator binds tightly to both the N-terminal (H1) and C-terminal (H2) regions of the activation domain (18Ikeda K. Stuehler T. Meisterernst M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Mittler G. Stuhler T. Santolin L. Uhlmann T. Kremmer E. Lottspeich F. Berti L. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP (p300) is critical for activation by VP16 in chromatin (20Kraus W.L.

The other major histone acetyltransferase, GCN5, which is part of the SAGA-STAGA/TFTC complex, is also recognized by VP16 (17Hardy S. Brand M. Mittler G. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Meisterernst M. Tora L.

Further related to chromatin accessibility, the remodeling Swi/Snf complex interacts with VP16 (24Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Wallberg A.E. Steger D.J. Cairns B.R. Wright A.P. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). VP16 binds Mediator tightly and specifically through the MED17 and the MED25 subunits (19Mittler G. Stuhler T. Santolin L. Uhlmann T. Kremmer E. Lottspeich F. Berti L. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Ito M. Yuan C.X. Malik S. Gu W.

Overexpression of the MED25 Mediator-binding domain has a dominant negative effect on VP16 activation, which substantiates the critical influence of a MED25-associated Mediator (19Mittler G. Stuhler T. Santolin L. Uhlmann T. Kremmer E. Lottspeich F. Berti L. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mediator apparently functions synergistically with other target proteins such as the histone acetyltransferases, CBP and GCN5, that are also necessary for activation by VP16 in living cells (17Hardy S. Brand M. Mittler G. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Meisterernst M. Tora L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32875-32882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we use an inducible Tet-VP16 in combination with stable reporter plasmids in HeLa cells and conducted a comprehensive molecular in vivo analysis of VP16 transcription activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies revealed the binding of many of the previously identified targets of VP16, among them GTFs, Mediator, CBP, GCN5, and PC4. We describe, for the first time, that VP16 binds to and recruits cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPSF/CstF) to regulatory regions in vivo. Also novel, we observed in the chromatin a marked influence of VP16 on dimethylation of lysine 79 in histone H3. The ChIP and biochemical analyses point to the use of a specific active Mediator by VP16, carrying MED25 and lacking the CDK8 module. Solid-phase assays further support the notion that Mediator composition is dynamically affected on genes, in an ATP-dependent manner. This apparently leads to the establishment of a variant Mediator enriched in core subunits and MED25 and lacking CDK8. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid pTU10 contains the EBV origin, an EBNA1 expression cassette, the hygromycin resistance gene as a genetic selection marker, and the luciferase gene under the control of a Tet-operator (tetO) linked to the Vβ12-3 promoter. The tetO sequence comprises seven repeats of a 42-bp motif that is specifically bound by the prokaryotic tetracycline repressor. For cloning of pTU10, the Vβ12-3 wt promoter was amplified by PCR (primers VBWTP1: GGG AGA TCT TTC TCT CAG CTT TCC and VBWTP3: GGG AAG CTT CTA GAC CAG GCC CTC TG) and ligated into the BglII and HindIII sites of pGL2-basic. The promoter and the 3′-located luciferase gene were transferred into the XbaI and SalI sites of pREP4, generating plasmid pPH273. The latter was linearized with XhoI, followed by insertion of the tetO sites generated by PCR on the pTRE2 vector (Clontech), using the following primers: 5′-GCCCTTTCGTCTCGAGTTTAC-3′ and 5′-TATCTCGAGCTCGACCCGGGTACC-3′. The CMV control vector (pEBNA-SVP-GL-EμCAG-rtTA, subsequently called pML53) carries an expression cassette for enhanced green fluorescence protein and the luciferase gene under the control of a bi-directional minimal CMV promoter with a central 7xtetO element in between. The CMV vector also harbors a constitutive expression cassette for the Tet repressor fused to three repeats of a minimal VP16 activation domain. Cell Transfection and Selection—2.5 × 106 HeLa Tet-On cells (Clontech) containing an integrated expression cassette for Tet-VP16 fusion protein were transfected with pTU10, or a laboratory stock of non-engineered HeLa cells were transfected with pML53, using PolyFect (Qiagen) reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were selected for 2 weeks to yield stable polyclonal cells that episomally replicate pTU10 or pML53 by using 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) or 3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), respectively, until the cells resumed a normal growth rate. For their maintenance the hygromycin concentration was reduced to 125 μg/ml and puromycin to 0.5 μg/ml. Typical copy numbers of the EBV plasmids are in the range of 1–10 in HeLa cells. Luciferase and Transcription Assays—Cells were grown in 6-well plates and induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma). 12 h after doxycycline induction, the cells were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of Lysis buffer (Promega). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation in a table-top centrifuge. 20 μl was used for the luciferase reporter assay (Promega), another 1 μl was used to determine the protein concentration according to Bradford (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were used to normalize luciferase values. In vitro transcription reactions were conducted using standard conditions and Jurkat nuclear extracts as described previously (19Mittler G. Stuhler T. Santolin L. Uhlmann T. Kremmer E. Lottspeich F. Berti L. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ChIP—ChIP assays were conducted mainly as described previously (26Gilfillan S. Stelzer G. Piaia E. Hofmann M.G. Meisterernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6222-6230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 60–80% confluency and were regularly tested for luciferase induction. In detail, the following procedure was applied: 1 × 108 HeLa cells were cross-linked by formaldehyde (Roth) at a final concentration of 1% added directly to the cell culture medium. The cross-linking reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was then blocked by addition of 2.5 m glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of sonification buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF), and the DNA was sheered to an average size of ∼500 bp using a Branson 250-D sonifier equipped with a Microtip (duty cycle: 30% output, 15 s on, 45 s off). 0.2% Sarkosyl (Sigma) and 5.67 g of CsCl (ICN Biochemicals) were added to 10 ml of chromatin solution and centrifuged at 18 °C in an SW40 rotor at 38,000 rpm for 36–48 h. The gradient was harvested, and the collected 1-ml fractions were analyzed directly in agarose gels. Fractions containing DNA with high mobility (below a size of ∼250 bp) and low mobility (containing highly cross-linked DNA-protein complexes that do not enter the gel) were omitted. CsCl fractions harboring intermediate-size fragments were pooled and dialyzed against TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), including 5% glycerol. To remove precipitates the dialyzed sample was subjected to high speed table-top centrifugation. The sample was further pre-cleared for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma, fraction V). For the immunoprecipitation 2 A260 units of cross-linked DNA were incubated over night with 2–5 μg of antibody and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA in a final volume of 1 ml of NET buffer (55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The sample was centrifuged and transferred to a new tube containing 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose beads equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 μg of BSA and then incubated for 4 h on a rotating platform at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with 500 μl of wash buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100); twice with wash buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 (DetI) or 1% Triton X-100 (DetII)); once in wash buffer III (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate) and twice in TE. The detergent conditions in wash buffer II for the specific antibodies used were the following: CBP (sc-369) DetI; GCN5 (sc-6303) DetI; PolII (sc-899) DetII; TFIIB (sc-225) DetI; TFIIH (sc-292) DetI; MED1 (sc-5334) DetII; MED23 (sc-5378) DetII; CDK8 (sc-1521) DetII; MED13 DetII; MED17 (sc-12453) DetII; MED25 (9C2) DetII; CPSF (sc-17289) DetII; CstF-64 (sc-16473) DetII; Ac-H4 (06–866) DetI; Ac-H3K9 (06–942) DetI; trimethyl-H3K4 (07–523) DetI; and dimethyl-H3K79 (07–366) DetI. Bound protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 150 μlof TE/1% SDS, and the formaldehyde cross-link was reversed at 65 °C overnight followed by addition of 1 μl of Proteinase K (Roche Applied Science, 15 mg/ml) and incubation for 1 h at 56 °C. After phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation using glycogen (Sigma, 10 μg) as a carrier. After 30 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, the DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried for 15 min, and resuspended in 40 μl of TE. The precipitated DNA was generally analyzed by radioactive PCR. 4 μl of template was used in a 50-μl reaction that included 0.1 μl of radioactive [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences, 3,000 Ci/mmol, final dNTP concentrations in the PCR were 16 μm). 1% of input DNA was subjected to PCR amplification as a reference. The PCR reaction optimized for a read-out in the linear range consisted of 27 duty cycles with 30 s for denaturing, annealing, and elongation steps, with the exception of the last cycle when the elongation time was prolonged to 5 min. The amplicons were separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The primers used for Vβ12-3 to analyze the promoter were 5′-TGCCAACTATATCCATCTGCACC and 5′-GAGTGGTAAACTCGAGTCTAACT. 5′-AGGCGTGTACGGTGGGAGGCC and 5′-AGGCTGGATCGGTCCCGGTGT were used on the CMV promoter. Proteins on the luciferase open reading frame were detected with 5′-TTCATAGCTTCTGCCAACCGA and 5′-AATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACAT. 5′-TGATACCCAGTAGTAGAGTGG and 5′-CAGCAGGAAAAGGACAAGCAG were used on the oriP. For real-time PCR analysis a GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system instrument (Applied Biosystems) was employed using a standard program for primers with a melting temperature of ∼60 °C. Levels of immunoprecipitated DNA are given relative to input DNA as determined by a calibration function. GST Pulldown Assay—VP16 pulldown assays were performed essentially as described previously (18Ikeda K. Stuehler T. Meisterernst M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HeLaS3 extracts were adjusted to 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF and incubated in siliconized Eppendorf tubes with VP16 derivatives fused to GST and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose at concentrations of 1 mg/ml for 16 h at 4 °C. After four washes with 50 column volumes of HEGN100 buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF) the bound proteins were eluted with SDS buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunodepletion of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were depleted using anti-MED15 and anti-MED25 rat monoclonal antibodies, MED1 rabbit antiserum (sc-8998, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and CDK8 goat antiserum (Santa Cruz sc-1521) cross-linked with dimethyl pimelimelidate to protein A-Sepharose beads (MED1) or protein G-Sepharose beads (MED15, MED25, and CDK8), essentially as described (27Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 100 μl of nuclear extracts was adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF and incubated twice for 3 h with 20 μl of antibody-bound protein A- or G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The protein concentration in HeLa nuclear extracts was 8–12 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml in Jurkat nuclear extracts (prepared by standard procedures). The different cell extracts yielded very similar results. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa nuclear extracts were adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF and incubated with the respective antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads for 16 h at 4 °C (MED15 and MED25 (as described in Refs. 19Mittler G. Stuhler T. Santolin L. Uhlmann T. Kremmer E. Lottspeich F. Berti L. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 27Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, respectively) and CstF64 (Santa Cruz sc-16473)). The rat monoclonal antibody 83M-9A12 was used (provided by E. Kremmer) as an isotype control for the rat monoclonal antibodies (MED15 and MED25). Normal goat serum (Santa Cruz sc-2043) was used as an isotype control for the goat polyclonal CDK8 antibody. Beads were washed three times with 50 column volumes of IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF), and bound proteins were analyzed on Western blots. Solid-phase Assay—The DNA template was amplified by PCR from the vector pGLMRG5, which stems from pMRG5, but contains a luciferase gene in place of the G-free cassette. The promoter comprises five GAL4 binding sites immediately upstream of a synthetic human immunodeficiency virus/major late core promoter, as described previously (28Xie J. Collart M. Lemaire M. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Primers: 5′-GCATTCTAGTTGTGGTTTGTCCAA (biotinylated) and 5′-GCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATGTT. The 412-bp template contains the core promoter downstream of the five GAL4 sites flanked by an upstream linker region (5′) and 91 bp of the luciferase coding region (3′). The template was purified on 1% agarose gels and recovered using a gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Biotinylated DNA templates were coupled to paramagnetic Streptavidin beads (Promega) as follows: the beads were washed twice in B&W buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.003% Nonidet P-40), then resuspended in B&W buffer, and 8.5 ng of biotinylated DNA (in TE with 1 m NaCl) template was added for each microgram of magnetic beads. After shaking for 30 min at room temperature, beads were washed once in B&W buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA (Sigma, fraction V). Beads were resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in buffer A (150 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml BSA (Sigma, fraction V), 0.2 mm PMSF) plus extra 5 mg/ml BSA (Sigma, fraction V) and 5 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with buffer A. A typical pre-initiation complex assembly reaction was conducted in a total volume of 100 μl containing: beads bound to 600 ng of DNA (2.4 pmol), 200 ng of Gal4-VP16 (2 μl in BC400 containing 100 μm Zn2+), comprising the C-terminal 147 amino acids of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, linked to the complete VP16 activation domain (amino acids 411–490), 2 μg of poly(dGdC), and 500 μg of HeLa or 200 μg of Jurkat nuclear extract, in transcription buffer (27Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in which the potassium ions were adjusted with 1 m potassium glutamate to 150 mm. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C the complexes bound to the DNA template were concentrated with a magnet and washed twice with 200 μl of buffer A. Nucleotides were added in a volume of 100 μl of buffer A at a final concentration of 500 μm to 1 mm. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min bead samples were concentrated with a magnet and washed twice with 200 μl of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed by Western blotting. An Inducible Tet-VP16-based in Vivo System as a Model for Transcription Complex Assembly at Class II Genes—The Tet-VP16 system was employed as a model to dissect the molecular processes during gene activation (29Gossen M. Bujard H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19 (discussion 216–217): 213-216PubMed Google Scholar). The version employed here includes a mutated Tet Repressor (tetR′) moiety that recognizes Tet operator sites (tetO) upon interaction with the antibiotic effector doxycycline (Tet-on). EBV-derived vectors carrying the viral origin of replication (oriP) and an expression cassette for the viral EBNA1 protein served as reporters (schematically shown in Fig. 1A). These features facilitate stable replication of low copy numbers of the plasmid in phase with the mammalian cell cycle in human cells (30Zhou J. Chau C.M. Deng Z. Shiekhattar R. Spindler M.P. Schepers A. Lieberman P.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1406-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two alternative promoters were employed in this investigation. The plasmid pTU10 contains seven multimerized Tet-operator sites 500 bp upstream of a rearranged T-cell receptor Vβ promoter subtype 12-3 (Fig. 1A). In previous investigations the Vβ12-3 promoter was shown to display moderate activity in T- and HeLa cells (31Halle J.P. Haus-Seuffert P. Woltering C. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A HeLa cell line stably replicating pTU10 and constitutively expressing a Tet repressor fused to the intact C-terminal activation domain of VP16 was generated. Doxycycline treatment induced luciferase expression (Fig. 1B) without detectable toxic effects on cell growth in the range of 0.01–10 μg (per milliliter of medium). Nearly saturating luciferase levels were consistently observed at concentrations of 1 μg/ml, with a further slight increase at 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1B). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of luciferase mRNA showed detectable levels after 15 min of induction that reached steady-state levels after ∼30 min (Fig. 1C). The second EBV-based vector carries two bidirectional CMV core promoter regions, with a central Tet-operator element in between, driving expression of luciferase and enhanced green fluorescence protein in opposite directions. This plasmid also expresses a Tet-VP16 molecule comprising multimerized minimal activation elements of VP16 (32Seipel K. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Induction levels were in the range of 100- to 400-fold at the CMV promoter (an example is shown in supplemental Fig. S1). VP16-dependent Assembly of Pre-initiation and Post-initiation Complexes—Having functionally established a rapid response to VP16, we next investigated the consequences at the level of transcription complex formation using a ChIP assay. The primer pairs used for ChIP-amplified fragments were located between the Tet sites and the Vβ12-3 core promoter (positions –430 to –247) or directly at the CMV core promoter region. These amplicons, subsequently referred to as promoter amplicons, thus monitor binding of transcription factors to both the regulatory and the core promoter region. Regulatory sites and the promoter are too close to each other on the EBV plasmids to be unambiguously distinguished within the resolution of the preparations (note that the plasmids tend to be more resistant to sonification than chromosomal DNA). In addition, control amplicons were established in the luciferase gene (luc, positions +532 to +735) and in the origin of replication (ori, located adjacent to the family of repeat element) present in both plasmids (see Fig. 1A). Conditions were established for these three primer pairs that generated PCR amplicons in the linear range at a defined input DNA concentration. All subsequent ChIP experiments were conducted under standardized conditions as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” ChIP experiments were repeated at least three times with independent biological samples. The Vβ12-3 and CMV cell lines were induced with doxycycline for 30 min, and the assembly of the RNA polymerase II machinery was monitored by ChIP. We initially used antibodies directed against TFIIB, TFIIH, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and the Mediator subunit MED25. RNAPII is expected to associate with the promoter and coding regions. TFIIB serves as a marker for active early pre-initiation complexes, whereas TFIIH monitors the late phase of PIC formation, when the promoter is opened and RNAPII moves from the start site into coding regions. We observed significant binding of GTFs, RNAPII and MED25, to promoters in the induced situation (Fig. 2A). Before induction, GTFs and RNAPII were undetectable. One exception to this is the low levels of TFIIH seen at the basal Vβ12-3 promoter. Furthermore, RNAPII was detected in the luciferase-coding region at Vβ12-3 and to a lesser extent in the CMV plasmid. This presumably relates to the higher basal activity of Vβ12-3 compared with CMV. RNAPII, but none of the general factors or Mediator, was detected in the coding region after induction with doxycycline (middle panel of Fig. 2A). Unfortunately, the available antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate Tet-VP16 at the Tet DNA element. This is presumably due to the tight packing of the small activation domain into target protein complexes. Based upon (i) the ChIP analysis and (ii) the doxycycline dependence of transcription activation (Fig. 1, B and C), we nevertheless conclude that Tet-VP16 binds to the gene. The activation domain of VP16 is known to act promiscuously and over large distances. This may explain why minor amounts of RNAPII were detected at the (∼2 kb distant) oriP control region (right panel, Fig. 2A). A reason for this may be the presence of cryptic promoters. In an attempt to obtain quantitative information about the different levels of RNAPII at promoter versus origin regions, real-time PCR analyses were performed. It revealed low but detectable amounts of RNAPII at both the origin and the promoter region in the non-induced situation (Fig. 2B). These low levels of RNAPII were not detectable in the more qualitative and less sensitive gel-based PCR analysis (Fig. 2A). Activation by doxycycline led to an ∼2-fold increase of binding at oriP as compared with a 9-fold enhancement at the promoter region (Fig. 2B). The quantitative experiment clearly shows that VP16 predominantly activates the"

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is a transcription factor that can be activated by a variety of stress signals, including DNA damage (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev.

Upon activation, p53 forms a homotetramer that binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoter of p53-regulated genes (4Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These p53 target genes subsequently regulate cell cycle progression, cell death, DNA repair, and DNA replication to maintain genomic stability and to prevent tumorigenesis. Mutations in p53 are found in ∼50% of all human cancers, and inactivation of p53 leads to cancer predisposition in animal models (7Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7457) Google Scholar). A key element for the tumor suppressor function of p53 is its transactivation activity (5Jimenez G.S. Nister M. Stommel J.M.

In cancers harboring wild type p53, the p53 tumor suppression activity may be circumvented by other genetic alternations that impair the transcription activity. For example, overexpression of mouse double minute 2 gene (MDM2), 2The abbreviations used are: MDM2, mouse double minute 2 gene; HDM2, human homologue of MDM2; BCCIP, BRCA2 and CDKN1A-interacting protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; Gy, gray. or its human homologue (HMD2), promotes the degradation of wild type p53, thus inhibiting the transcription activity of p53 (10Bond G.L. Hu W. Levine A.J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2005; 5: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In some cancer types, such as breast cancer, p53 mutation is detected in only ∼20% of the total cases. Therefore, identification of alternative mechanisms by which p53 transactivation function is impaired may provide further insights into the molecular etiology of the human cancers harboring wild type p53. BCCIPα is a BRCA2 and CDKN1A (p21, Cip1, and Waf1)-interacting protein, which has also been named Tok-1α (11Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z.

A second isoform, BCCIPβ, sharing an N-terminal acidic domain and a central conserved domain but with a distinct C-terminal domain, also interacts with BRCA2 and p21 (13Lu H. Guo X. Meng X. Liu J.

Gene. 2003; 302: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). More than 70% of astrocytic brain tumors lack BCCIP expression, and the lack of BCCIP expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of astrocytic brain tumors. 3J. Liu, H. Lu, H. Ohgaki, A. Merlo, and Z. Shen, manuscript in preparation. In this report, we found that down-regulation of BCCIP overrides the transcriptional activity of wild type p53, suggesting a novel mechanism by which the p53 transactivation function can be compromised. It has significant implication for the understanding of tumorigenesis in cancers harboring wild type p53. Cell Culture—HCT116 and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 20 mm glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Plasmids were transfected into cells using the Geneporter transfection kit (Gene Therapy Systems Inc., San Diego, CA). Antibodies and Western Blot—Rabbit anti-BCCIPα/β antibodies were reported previously (11Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Anti-HDM2, anti-GST, and anti-p53 (No. 1801) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p53 (Ab-6) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma. Protein extracts were prepared from cells lysed with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described (11Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Knock Down of BCCIP Expression by Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA)—Two vectors were used to express shRNA to knock down BCCIP expression. The plasmid pPUR/U6 (17Meng X. Yuan Y. Maestas A. Shen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6098-6105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) uses a puromycin resistance cassette, while the pSilencer2.1Hyg (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) uses hygromycin B as the selection marker. The control vectors express either a scrambled sequence 5′-ACT ACC GTT GTT ATA GGT G-3′ (Ambion Inc.) in pSilencer2.1Hygomycin or a green fluorescent protein cDNA sequence 5′-GGT TAT GTA CAG GAA CGC A-3′ in pPUR/U6. To knock down both BCCIPα and BCCIPβ isoforms, several shRNA sequences targeted at the shared region of BCCIPα and BCCIPβ were used, including shRNA-αβ311 (5′-GTG TGA TTA AGC AAA CGG ATG-3′), shRNA-αβ633 (5′-GCC ATG TGG GAA GTG CTA C-3′), and shRNA-αβ730 (5′-GCT GCG TTA ATG TTT GCA AAT-3′). We found that application of a single shRNA can only cause ∼50% down-regulation of BCCIP. To further knock down BCCIPα/β, we combined two shRNAs, αβ311 and αβ633, or αβ311 and αβ730, creating ∼95% down-regulation of BCCIP. This is feasible because pPUR/U6 and pSilencer use different selection markers, puromycin and hygromycin B, respectively. Radiation Survival Assays—The radiation sensitivities of HCT116 and HCT116 cells with BCCIP down-regulations were determined by colony formation assays. The numbers of cells to be plated for each radiation dosage group were determined by a pilot experiment in order to yield 50–150 surviving colonies/100-mm plate. Cells in each dosage group were plated in triplicate. After the appropriate number of cells were plated for 18 h, cells were irradiated with Cs-137 γ-rays (dose rate, 0.893 Gy/min), and colonies were grown for 12–14 days after which the colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with 1% crystal violet. The number of colonies was normalized to the number of cells plated to calculate the survival fraction. The experiments were repeated at least twice. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—A p53 reporter plasmid p53-Luc was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). This reporter plasmid p53-Luc confers p53-dependent expression of luciferase. MG15-luc (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein) was a negative control with the mutation at p53 binding sites (18el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). WWP-luc (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein) was a reporter gene with 2.4-kb p21WAF1 promoter region (19el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7933) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay to Detect the Binding of p53 with p21 and HDM2 Promoters—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed with the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after cells were cross-linked and their chromatin sheared, extract from an equal number of cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation with agarose-conjugated monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies or agarose-conjugated control mouse IgG. The amounts of input and precipitated p53 in each sample were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-p53 polyclonal antibody. After the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, the precipitated p53-bound p21 or HDM2 promoter DNAs were detected by PCR and quantified with the DNA Engine Opticon™ 2 Real-time Detection System (M J Research Inc., Reno, NV). The primers for the p21 promoter were 5′-TCC ACC TTT CAC CAT TCC CCT ACC C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAG CCC AAG GAC AAA ATA GCC ACC A-3′ (reverse). The primers for HDM2 promoter were 5′-CGG GAG GTC CGG ATG ATC GCA GG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTC GGT GCT TAC CTG GAT CAG C-3′ (reverse). Binding of p53 with Its Consensus Binding Sequence Detected by a Biotin-Streptavidin Pulldown Assay—One palindrome oligonucleotide, containing biotin on the nucleotide at the 5′-position, was used in the pulldown assays. The sequence of the oligonucleotide was 5′-biotin-GGA CAT GCC CGG GCA TGT CC-3′. The sequence has been reported to be the strongest p53 binding consensus (20Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. Briefly, the cells were suspended in three packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol with protease inhibitors) and allowed to swell for 10 min on ice. The cells were homogenized and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The released nuclei were suspended in half the packed cell volume of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture of protease inhibitors), followed by the dropwise addition of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.6 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture of protease inhibitors). The nuclear suspensions were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants (nuclear extracts) were stored at –80 °C in aliquots. One microgram of each double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with 300 μg of nuclear protein for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris. pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) competitor. Following the incubation, 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Pierce Biotechnology) was added to the reaction and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Prior to this step, 300 μl of the original streptavidin-agarose bead preparation was preabsorbed with 500 μl of bovine serum albumin, 50 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 25 °C. The streptavidin-agarose beads were washed three times and resuspended in 300 μl of the binding buffer. The protein-DNA-streptavidin-agarose complex was washed three times with binding buffer and loaded onto an SDS gel. The bound proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted with p53 antibody. p53 Tetramer Formation—To test whether BCCIP promotes p53 tetramer formation in vitro, 1 μg of recombinant p53 was incubated for 30 min with 1 μg of recombinant BCCIP (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 20% (v/v) glycerol) followed by addition of 10 mm diamide (Sigma) to cross-link interacting proteins as described previously by others (21Hanson S. Kim E. Deppert W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After 20 min, the incubation reaction mixtures were separated in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection of p53 was performed by using p53 Ab6 antibody. Lack of p21 and HDM2 Expressions in BCCIP Knockdown Cells—Our previous work showed that overexpression of either BCCIPα or BCCIPβ increases p21 level and partial knock down of BCCIPα or/and BCCIPβ by RNA interference reduces p21 mRNA levels (15Meng X. Lu H. Shen Z. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that the induction of p21 by BCCIP overexpression is dependent on p53 and that the p53 transactivation activity is enhanced by BCCIP overexpression (15Meng X. Lu H. Shen Z. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To further identify the mechanism by which BCCIP regulates p21 expression, BCCIP expression was reduced by expression of shRNA targeted at several common regions of BCCIPα and BCCIPβ (Fig. 1A). Because a single shRNA can only reduce the level of BCCIP by ∼50%, we applied two independent BCCIP shRNAs in HCT116 cells, BCCIP shRNA-αβ633 and shRNA-αβ311 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This resulted in >95% down-regulation of BCCIP. The cells were exposed to 3 or 10 Gy of γ-irradiation. At 1, 6, and 16 h after the irradiation, we observed down-regulation of p21 in BCCIP knockdown cells (Fig. 1B). A previous report has shown that partial knock down of BCCIP also results in reduced mRNA level of p21 (15Meng X. Lu H. Shen Z. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expression of another p53 target gene, HDM2, is also inhibited in BCCIP knockdown cells. It is critical to point out that BCCIP knock down resulted in the down-regulation of p21 and HDM2 but p53 protein level was not reduced (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the transcription activity of p53 in BCCIP knockdown cells is impaired. To confirm this, combination of BCCIP shRNA-αβ730 and shRNA-αβ311 was used to down-regulate BCCIP (Fig. 1C). Again in these BCCIP knockdown cells, we observed significant down-regulation of p21 and HDM2 proteins (Fig. 1C), although p53 expression increased. These data strongly suggest that, in the absence of BCCIP, the expression of p53 downstream target genes p21 and HDM2 is severely impaired, suggesting an abrogation of p53 transcription activity in BCCIP knockdown cells. In this report, we focus on the mechanism by which BCCIP down-regulation abolishes p21 and HDM2 expression. The mechanism by which BCCIP knock down induces p53 is not the focus of this report but will be discussed (see “Discussion”). Inhibition of p53 Transactivation Activity in BCCIP Knockdown Cells—Because the expression of p21 and HDM2 is regulated by p53, we hypothesized that the transactivation activity of p53 is impaired in the BCCIP knockdown cells. To test this, a plasmid (p53-luc) containing 13 copies of the p53 binding consensus sequence upstream of a luciferase reporter gene was transfected into cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the reporter activity was induced by γ-irradiation in control cells. However, the p53 reporter activity was significantly reduced in BCCIP knockdown cells, suggesting a lack of p53 protein transcription activity. To confirm this, the expression of another luciferase reporter (WWP-Luc) that is regulated by a 2.4-kb promoter DNA sequence of the p21 gene was transfected into the HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the p21 promoter activity was also severely inhibited in the absence of BCCIP. The activity of a control reporter (pGal4-Luc) that is driven by the Gal4 promoter and independent of p53 was not altered in BCCIP knockdown cells (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the p53 transactivation activity is impaired in BCCIP knockdown cells, even though p53 protein level is increased (Fig. 1, B and C). Defective p53 Binding with Its Targeting Promoter Sequences in BCCIP Knockdown Cells—p53 transactivates its downstream target genes by binding with their promoter sequences (19el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7933) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanism by which BCCIP knock down inhibits the p53 transactivation activity, we hypothesized that the binding of p53 to its target DNA sequences is hindered in BCCIP knockdown cells. To test this, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to measure the binding of p53 to the p21 and HDM2 promoters. After the p53 protein was precipitated, the p53-associated p21 and HDM2 promoter DNAs were detected by PCR. As shown in Fig. 3A, the binding of p53 with p21 and HDM2 promoter DNA was enhanced after γ-irradiation in control cells. However, the amounts of p53-co-precipitated p21 and HDM2 promoter DNA were significantly reduced in BCCIP knockdown cells (Fig. 3A), although no less amount of p53 proteins were precipitated in BCCIP knockdown cells than the control (Fig. 3B). Nonspecific IgG did not precipitate p53 protein nor did p21 and HDM2 promoters (data not shown). Based on real-time PCR quantification, the binding of p53 with p21 and HDM2 promoters was reduced by 4–5-folds in irradiated BCCIP knockdown cells (Fig. 3, C and D). To confirm that the wild type p53 failed to bind with the consensus sequence in BCCIP knockdown cells, biotin-labeled p53 consensus (20Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) double-stranded DNA was incubated with cell extracts. The cellular proteins bound with these sequences were precipitated by streptavidin resins and detected by anti-p53 blot (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). As shown in Fig. 3E, binding of p53 protein with this DNA sequence is increased by irradiation in control cells but significantly less p53 protein was co-precipitated with the consensus p53 binding DNA in BCCIP knockdown cells. These data confirm an inhibition of p53 binding with its target DNA sequence in BCCIP knockdown cells, suggesting that the reduction of p53 transcription activity in BCCIP knockdown cells is due to a role of BCCIP in regulating p53 binding to its target DNA sequences. However, BCCIP appears unable to directly bind with p21 or HDM2 promoter DNA (data not shown). Down-regulation of BCCIP in Wild Type p53 Cells Confers Radiation Resistance—Lack of p53 transactivation activity is associated with radiation resistance and cell cycle checkpoint defects. We have previously shown that BCCIP down-regulation abrogates DNA damage-induced G1/S checkpoint activation in p53 wild type HT1080 cells (14Meng X. Liu J. Shen Z. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To confirm that BCCIP defect confers radiation resistance, the BCCIP expression in HCT116 was knocked down by BCCIP-shRNA and radiation sensitivities were measured by colony formation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 4, down-regulation of BCCIP in HCT116 cells confers radiation resistance to the same level as that of HCT116 (p53–) cells. These data, in combination with previously published results (14Meng X. Liu J. Shen Z. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), further support a role of BCCIP in p53-related functions. BCCIP Promotes p53 Tetramer Formation—Having shown that BCCIP is required for the binding of p53 with the promoters of its target genes, we further investigated the potential mechanisms underlining this observation. Several factors, including Ser-15 phosphorylation in the N-terminal transactivation domain (23Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar) and p53 acetylation in the p53 C-terminal domain (24Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar), have been shown to regulate p53 transactivation activity. However, we did not find significant alterations of Ser-15 phosphorylation or p53 acetylation in BCCIP knockdown cells (data not shown). In addition, p53 remains in the nucleus in BCCIP knockdown cells (data not shown). Because it is the tetrameric form of p53 that binds with its target DNA sequences (4Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we tested whether BCCIP is required for the formation of tetrameric p53. After incubation of recombinant p53 protein with purified BCCIPα and BCCIPβ, the protein solution was cross-linked by diamide (21Hanson S. Kim E. Deppert W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5, incubation of p53 with either BCCIPα or BCCIPβ significantly increases the formation of tetrameric p53 protein. Therefore, we suggest that BCCIP is required for the formation of p53 tetramer, which is the transcriptionally active conformation of p53. These data suggest that BCCIP may promote p53 transcription activity by facilitating the formation of p53 tetramers, which then bind to promoter DNA sequences to activate target gene transcription. Although BCCIP is required for the p53 tetramer formation, we did not observe a cross-link between p53 and BCCIP (Fig. 5), suggesting that BCCIP may promote p53 tetramer formation without a stable interaction between them. BCCIP Weakly Interacts with the p53—We next addressed the potential mechanisms by which BCCIP may regulate p53 tetramerization. Because acetylation and phosphorylation of p53 (modification that may regulate p53 transcription activity) were not altered in BCCIP knockdown cells (data not shown), we focused on whether BCCIP may interact with p53, although we anticipated that this interaction, if any, would be transient or weak. Recombinant GST-tagged BCCIPα, BCCIPβ, and GST (negative control) were incubated with His-tagged p53 recombinant protein. We found that pull down of GST-BCCIPα and GST-BCCIPβ fusion protein (but not GST alone) with glutathione beads co-precipitates with p53 (Fig. 6A), suggesting a direct interaction between BCCIP and p53. We also expressed Myc-tagged p53 in HCT116 (p53–/–) cells (Myc-UBC9 was transfected as a control). After the Myc-p53 and Myc-UBC9 were precipitated by anti-Myc resin, we detected a small portion of endogenous BCCIPα and BCCIPβ co-precipitated with p53 (Fig. 6B). In addition, when Myc-p53 and Myc-UBC9 were co-expressed with FLAG-tagged BCCIPα and BCCIPβ, we found that a small amount of p53 was co-precipitated with FLAG-BCCIP, but not UBC9 (Fig. 6C). These data suggest an interaction between the full-length p53 and BCCIP. As shown in Fig. 5, diamide, which cross-links protein by forming a disulfate link, did not cause cross-link between p53 and BCCIP (Fig. 5), and we were not able to precipitate endogenous p53 with BCCIP (data not shown). Thus, the interaction between full-length p53 and BCCIP is likely to be transient or weak. In this report, we show that BCCIP weakly associates with p53. Without BCCIP, wild type p53 fails to form tetramers (Fig. 5), cannot bind with its target promoter sequences (Fig. 3), and is defective in transactivation function (Fig. 2). Furthermore, down-regulation of BCCIP confers resistance of HCT116 cells to radiation damage to the same level as p53 defect (Fig. 4). Thus, BCCIP defects override the wild type p53 transactivation activity, suggesting a critical role of BCCIP in maintaining the wild type p53 transactivation function and p53 tumor suppression activity. It has been reported that a reductase, Ref1/APE1, transiently interacts with p53 and is required for p53 tetramer formation (21Hanson S. Kim E. Deppert W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar to APE1/Ref1 and p53 interaction, the interaction between BCCIP and p53 is likely transient and weak, as diamide cannot cross-link purified APE1 with p53 in vitro yet it promotes the tetramer formation (21Hanson S. Kim E. Deppert W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The function of Ref1/APE in promoting p53 activity is dependent on the APE1 reductase activity mediated by critical cysteine residues (21Hanson S. Kim E. Deppert W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We also tested whether BCCIP may act as a reductase to promote p53 tetramer formation. Mutation of cysteine residues 153, 157, 213, and 216 in the common region between BCCIPα and BCCIPβ did not affect the role of BCCIP in promoting p53 tetramerization (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that BCCIP may regulate p53 tetramer formation by a distinct mechanism, such as by serving as a p53 chaperone. This prediction is subject to further investigation. Although our data suggest that BCCIP may regulate p53 transcription activity by promoting tetramer formation, the potential contribution of alternative mechanisms cannot be ruled out. First, Gottifredi et al. (25Gottifredi V. Shieh S. Taya Y. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have shown that replication blockage by hydroxyurea results in binding of p53 to the stalled replication sites, which sequesters p53 away from the promoter, thus limiting the transcription activity of p53 (25Gottifredi V. Shieh S. Taya Y. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26Takimoto R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When there are a large number of stalled replication forks, p53 binding to stalled replication forks may lead to down-regulation of its transcription activity (25Gottifredi V. Shieh S. Taya Y. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26Takimoto R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because BCCIP is involved in homologous recombinational repair (13Lu H. Guo X. Meng X. Liu J. Allen C. Wray J. Nickoloff J.A. Shen Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is possible that the BCCIP defect produces an excessive level of stalled replication forks that then sequester p53 away from the promoters. Second, a nonspecific DNA binding domain is located in the p53 C terminus (27Robles A.I. Linke S.P. Harris C.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6898-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). According to one model, this C-terminal domain may bind to DNA non-specifically and then slide along the linear DNA to locate the specific binding motif (28Liu Y. Lagowski J.P. Vanderbeek G.E. Kulesz-Martin M.F. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is possible that the interaction of BCCIP with the p53 affects the initiation of the nonspecific DNA binding of p53, which affects the localization of p53 to the consensus binding motif. Third, it has been reported that overexpression of BRCA2 inhibits p53 transcription activity (22Marmorstein L.Y. Ouchi T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Because BCCIP interacts with BRCA2, it is possible that BCCIP may regulate p53 transcription activity via BRCA2. In addition, although our data suggest that lack of p53 transcription activity significantly contributes to the down-regulation of p21, we cannot exclude that alternative mechanisms may also contribute to the down-regulation of p21 in BCCIP knockdown cells, as BCCIP directly interacts with p21 and basal level of p21 expression can still be observed in some-p53 deficient cells. One consistent observation is that down-regulation of BCCIP increases p53 protein level, although this increased p53 does not confer enhanced transactivation activity due to the failure of p53 to bind with target promoters. Although the mechanism by which BCCIP knock down increases p53 is not the focus of this report and remains to be determined in the future, two explanations are plausible. First, because of the lack of p53 transactivation activity, HDM2 expression is significantly inhibited. This may provide a feedback mechanism to increase p53 protein level. Second, it has been reported that defect of BRCA2 results in elevated p53 protein level. Because BCCIP interacts with BRCA2 and BCCIP is involved in recombinational repair (13Lu H. Guo X. Meng X. Liu J. Allen C. Wray J. Nickoloff J.A. Shen Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is possible that lack of BCCIP results in accumulation of endogenous DNA damage, which in turn may stabilize the p53 protein. Nevertheless, the elevated p53 protein level in BCCIP knockdown cells does not confer transactivation activity of p53 as demonstrated in our report. A previous report has shown a role of BCCIP in homologous recombinational DNA repair (13Lu H. Guo X. Meng X. Liu J. Allen C. Wray J. Nickoloff J.A. Shen Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which implies that down-regulation of BCCIP would sensitize cells to radiation. On the other hand, defective BCCIP abrogates the p53 function and thus may confer resistance to DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 4, the overall outcome of these apparently opposite effects is radiation resistance in HCT116 cells. This has potential implications in tumor progression and radiation therapy: the reduced homologous recombinational repair combined with resistance to DNA damage would promote further genomic instability and tumor progression, while the resistance to radiation in BCCIP down-regulated cells may imply a poor outcome of radiation therapy for cancers with defective BCCIP but wild type p53. We have previously reported that expression of BCCIP is down-regulated in kidney cancer (16Meng X. Liu J. Shen Z. Gene. 2003; 302: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression of BCCIP is absent in >70% of astrocytic brain tumor, and the lack of BCCIP expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of astrocytic brain tumors,3 suggesting an etiological role of BCCIP in cancer. Data shown in this report have demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of wild type p53 can be compromised due to BCCIP down-regulation. Thus, BCCIP defect may contribute to tumorigenesis by overruling the p53 transactivation activity in cancers harboring wild type p53. We thank Jingmei Liu (UMDNJ) for critical reading of the manuscript and Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University) for providing the HCT116 cells and p53 target gene expression reporters."

https://openalex.org/W2010326165,"Activating mutations in members of the RAS family of genes are among the most common genetic events in human tumorigenesis. Once thought to be functionally interchangeable, it is increasingly recognized that the classical members of this protein family (H-RAS, N-RAS and K-RAS4B) exhibit unique and shared functions that are highly context-dependent. Herein, we demonstrate that the presence of an oncogenic KRAS allele results in elevated levels of GTP-bound N-RAS (N-RAS·GTP) in two human colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT 116 and DLD-1, compared to their isogenic counterparts in which the mutant KRAS allele has been disrupted by homologous recombination. N-RAS subserves an antiapoptotic role in cells expressing wild-type K-RAS; this function is compromised, however, by the presence of mutant K-RAS, and these cells display increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. We additionally identify a physical interaction between N-RAS and gelsolin, a factor that has been shown to promote survival and show that the N-RAS:gelsolin complex is modulated differently in wild-type and mutant K-RAS environments following apoptotic challenge. These findings represent the first biochemical evidence of a functional relationship between endogenous RAS proteins and identify a dynamic physical interaction between endogenous N-RAS and gelsolin that correlates with survival."
https://openalex.org/W2060337518,"The Six1 homeoprotein is an important mediator of normal development, where it is critical for the proliferation of precursor cell populations that ultimately constitute the muscle, kidney and inner ear, among other organs. Interestingly, its overexpression has been observed in numerous cancers, where it contributes to the proliferative and metastatic ability of the cancer cells. Here we show that Six1 not only regulates the cell cycle, but is itself regulated throughout the cell cycle via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The protein is present from the G1/S boundary until mitosis, when it is degraded via the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) with its activating subunit Cdh1. However, unlike most identified APCCdh1 targets, Six1 does not contain functional destruction or KEN box motifs that are necessary for its degradation. Instead, the Six1 protein contains multiple, as yet undefined, sequences within its N- and C-termini responsible for its degradation, including an N-terminal region that binds to Cdh1. Cell cycle regulation of Six1 occurs both transcriptionally and post-translationally via phosphorylation; therefore, this study demonstrates a third and novel mechanism of cell cycle-specific regulation of Six1, underscoring the importance of confining its activity to a defined cell cycle window from the G1/S boundary to early mitosis."

The resulting sequential events have been monitored in the brain of normal and hypertensive rats of the Milan strain, diverging for a constitutive alteration in the level of [Ca2+]i found to be present in nerve cells of hypertensive animals. After 2 weeks of treatment, the levels of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and of native calpastatin are profoundly decreased. These degradative processes, more pronounced in the brain of hypertensive rats, are progressively and efficiently compensated in the brain of both rat strains by different incoming mechanisms. Along with calpastatin degradation, 15-kDa still-active inhibitory fragments are accumulated, capable of efficiently replacing the loss of native inhibitor molecules. A partial return to a more efficient control of Ca2+ homeostasis occurs in parallel, assured by an early increase in the expression of Ca2+-ATPase and of calpastatin, both producing, after 12 weeks of a high salt (sodium) diet, the restoration of almost original levels of the Ca2+ pump and of significant amounts of native inhibitor molecules. Thus, conservative calpastatin fragmentation, associated with an increased expression of Ca2+-ATPase and of the calpain natural inhibitor, has been demonstrated to occur in vivo in rat brain.

However, in these reports, the fact that a large excess of calpastatin is normally present in brain is not considered, and no explanation has been given on the possible ineffectiveness of the inhibitor under the experimental conditions used (31Shields D.C.

It must also be considered that the severe and irreversible cell damage observed under these pathological conditions occurs in the presence of a massive Ca2+ influx, associated with the collapse of the membrane potential. On the basis of these considerations, it seems therefore reasonable to assume that in brain cells, as well as in other cell types, a moderate alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis, even prolonged for a long period of time, could evoke adaptive compensatory defense mechanisms capable of preserving cell integrity.To explore in vivo the existence in the brain of such mechanisms and to characterize their molecular aspects, we have treated normal normotensive Milan strain rats (NMS) 2The abbreviations used are: NMS, normotensive Milan strain rats; HMS, hypertensive Milan strain rats; CI-1, calpain inhibitor 1; PM, plasma membrane; HSD, high salt (sodium) diet; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 2The abbreviations used are: NMS, normotensive Milan strain rats; HMS, hypertensive Milan strain rats; CI-1, calpain inhibitor 1; PM, plasma membrane; HSD, high salt (sodium) diet; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. with a high salt (sodium) diet (HSD) known to promote elevation in blood pressure in response to a mild increase in intracellular free [Ca2+] in vascular smooth muscle, via an alteration in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (41Aviv A.

A role of the exchanger in the alteration of calcium homeostasis in brain has been previously suggested (44Zeitz O. Maass A.E. Van Nguyen P. Hensmann G. Kogler H. Moller K. Hasenfuss G.

To amplify the effects of this treatment we have exposed hypertensive rats (HMS) of the same Milan strain (46Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Berber B.R. de Jong W Handbook of Hypertension. 4. Elsevier, 1984: 328-349Google Scholar) to the same diet, because these animals are characterized by an unbalanced calpain-calpastatin system in heart, kidney, and erythrocytes (13Averna M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38426-38432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), probably due to a genetically determined deregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.In the present study, we report that after 2 weeks of HSD treatment, as expected, [Ca2+]i increases in the aorta and also in brain cells of NMS rats. These modifications induced upon HSD treatment are more pronounced in the brain of HMS rats, probably because of a constitutively slightly elevated basal level of [Ca2+]i.Thus, on the basis of these differences, both animals represent appropriate models to study in vivo the effects of the increase in [Ca2+]i on the calpain-calpastatin system. This relationship has been explored on the basis of: (i) changes in the level of calpain activity during HSD treatment; (ii) appearance of the activated calpain form; (iii) degradation of calpain protein substrate such as plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and fodrin; and (iv) levels and molecular properties of calpastatin. The results obtained provide a new understanding of how the activity of the calpain-calpastatin system is regulated in vivo to prevent irreversible cell damage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Leupeptin, aprotinin, calpain inhibitor 1 (CI-1), monoclonal anti-fodrin antibody, and monoclonal anti-m-calpain (Domain III/IV) were purchased from Sigma.

Calcium Green-1/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes.Animals—To induce experimental hypertension, adult male normotensive (NMS) and hypertensive (HMS) Milan strain rats (46Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Berber B.R. de Jong W Handbook of Hypertension. 4. Elsevier, 1984: 328-349Google Scholar) of about 60 days old were housed under controlled conditions (22 °C ± 1; humidity 50% ± 5%; lighting 8–20 h), were fed on a standard rat chow, and drank ad libitum NaCl dissolved in tap water at a concentration of 10 g/liter for 15, 30, or 90 days. Each rat received ∼0.7 g of NaCl every day. Alternatively, 25 μm CI-1 was dissolved in tap water in the presence or in the absence of 10 g/liter NaCl and administrated to NMS and HMS rats at the beginning of the experiment for 2 or 4 weeks. Each rat received ∼0.7 mg of CI-1 every day. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional ethical guidelines. During the course of the experiments, no appreciable changes were observed either in food consumption or body weight.Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography (W + W Electronic, BP recorder 8005) on preheated rats (37 °C) following the procedure originally described by Byrom and Wilson (49Byrom F.B. Wilson C.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1938; 93: 301-304Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using five animals for each treatment.Ca2+ Imaging—NMS and HMS rats untreated and treated with HSD (high salt diet) for 2 weeks, were sacrificed by decapitation. Brains were immediately collected, and the tissue was dispersed by gently squeezing in 10 mm oxygenated HEPES containing 0.14 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (buffer A). The suspensions were then filtered trough a gauze, and the tissue fragments were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 15 μm calcium green 1-AM (50Martínez-Zaguilán R. Parnami G. Lynch R.M. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with buffer, A to remove the flourophore excess, and fluorescence was detected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope, connected to a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope equipped with an N.A. 0.75 objective (×40).Thoracic aorta were rapidly excised from the same animals, placed in oxygenated buffer A and stripped of connective tissue. Arterial segments (0.2 × 0.5 cm) were incubated in buffer A with 15 μm calcium green 1-AM.

Each image was divided in ten sections, and the fluorescence value of each part was determined and the arithmetical mean was evaluated. The mean intensity value for each animal tissue utilized for these were calculated from the analysis of ten different images. Variation of the values was taken as an indication of corresponding changes in [Ca2+]i.Determination of Ca2+-ATPase Activity in Rat Brain—NMS and HMS rats were sacrificed by decapitation, the brains were rapidly removed, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. To detect both plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activities, aliquots (0.3 g) were minced and re-suspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm AEBSF. The samples were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and lysed by sonication, and the particulate material was collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 10 min). Membranes were washed, and Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured as described (52Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Arch. Biochem.

The particulate material was discarded by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 10 min), the clear supernatant (crude extract) was heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble material (heated extract) was collected and loaded onto a Source 15 Q (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.5 × 3 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (40 ml) 0–0.35 m NaCl and collected in 1-ml fractions. Calpastatin activity was measured on aliquots of each fraction, as previously described (48Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem.

One unit of calpastatin activity is defined as the amount of inhibitor required to inhibit one unit of human erythrocyte calpain.Separation of Calpain Isoforms by Ion-exchange Chromatography—Freshly collected brains (2 g) from NMS and HMS rats were minced, homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and lysed by sonication in 3 volumes of chilled buffer B without proteases inhibitors. Crude extracts prepared as described above were collected and loaded onto a Source 15 Q under the same conditions described for calpastatin ion-exchange chromatography.

Calpain activity was measured directly on samples of each crude extract in the usual assay mixture containing 1 mm CaCl2 (56Melloni E. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Michetti M. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Alternatively, to determine total calpain activity, 25 mg of the same samples were immediately loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). This chromatographic step separates calpastatin from calpain (57De Tullio R. Stifanese R. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem.

Am. J. Hypertens. 1996; 9: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 43Iwamoto T.

In parallel we have submitted the same treatment to genetically determined hypertensive rats of the same strain (HMS).According to previous reports (43Iwamoto T. Kita S. Zhang J. Blaustein M. Arai Y. Yoshida S. Wakimoto K. Komuro I. Katsuragi T. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we have observed that in NMS rats, HSD treatment produces elevation in blood pressure (Fig. 1A) from 105 to 145–150 mm Hg, accompanied by a 1.4–1.5 increase in fluorescence recorded following exposure of aorta slices to calcium green fluorescence (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that HSD treatment promotes a contraction of aorta smooth muscle mediated by an alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis. In HMS rats the elevated blood pressure (Fig. 1A) is associated to a constitutively increased [Ca2+] ranging from 1.8–1.9-fold (Fig. 1B). This calcium concentration is further increased (2.3-fold) by 2-week treatment with HSD (Fig. 1B).Because the calcium green loading of aorta slice"

Here, we report that a senescence-like growth inhibition is also achieved in human carcinoma cells upon the transduction of H-RasV12. Ras-induced tumor senescence can be recapitulated by the transduction of activated, but not wild-type, MEK. The ability for H-RasV12 to suppress tumor cell growth is drastically compromised in cells that harbor endogenous activating ras mutations. Notably, growth inhibition of tumor cells containing ras mutations can be achieved through the introduction of activated MEK. Tumor senescence induced by Ras signaling can occur in the absence of p16 or Rb and is not interrupted by the inactivation of Rb, p107, or p130 via short hairpin RNA or the transduction with HPV16 E7. In contrast, inactivation of p21 via short hairpin RNA disrupts Ras-induced tumor senescence. In summary, this study uncovers a senescence-like program activated by Ras signaling to inhibit cancer cell growth. This program appears to be intact in cancer cells that do not harbor ras mutations. Moreover, cancer cells that carry ras mutations remain susceptible to tumor senescence induced by activated MEK. These novel findings can potentially lead to the development of innovative cancer intervention. Activated Ras signaling can induce a permanent growth arrest in osteosarcoma cells.

Current strategies for treating cancer largely rely on inducing apoptosis to eradicate tumor cells (1Dlamini Z. Mbita Z. Ledwaba T. Future Oncol. 2005; 1: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Indeed, many cancer therapeutic agents are useful due to their ability to induce cell death or apoptosis in tumor cells. Despite the promising outcomes, apoptosis-based therapeutic strategies can be limited by high toxicity and lack of selectivity (2Leszczyniecka M. Roberts T. Dent P. Grant S. Fisher P.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 90: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition, many cancer cells are refractory to chemotherapeutic agents intended to induce apoptosis (3Lee S. Schmitt C.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Viktorsson K. Lewensohn R. Zhivotovsky B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2005; 94: 143-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is necessary, therefore, to explore alternative means of tumor suppression. Senescence was originally defined as the limited replicative capacity of normal human diploid fibroblasts in culture (hence, termed replicative senescence) (5Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). It is now understood that replicative senescence occurs as a result of progressive telomere shortening, leading to permanent growth arrest of cells and a defined lifespan (6Greider C.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R178-R181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shay J.W. J. Clin. Pathol. 1997; 50: 799-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Blasco M.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence, however, suggests that a senescence phenotype can also be triggered through mechanisms independent of telomere shortening, such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, ionizing radiation, and oncogene activation (9Serrano M.

A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Importantly, several recent in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that tumor cells also undergo senescence in response to various cancer treatments (17te Poele R.H. Okorokov A.L. Jardine L. Cummings J. Joel S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1876-1883PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gewirtz D.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Shay J.W. Roninson I.B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2919-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that senescence might be a useful therapeutic option to treat cancer. The molecular mechanisms involved in tumor senescence, however, remain poorly understood. Senescence is a signaling program that can be activated through various stimuli to induce permanent growth arrest of cells (18Gewirtz D.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ras proteins are vital signaling molecules that mediate various cellular responses (20Wennerberg K. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The ras family comprises three genes that encode highly homologous protein isoforms: H-, N-, and K-Ras (21Harvey J.J.

Activated Ras proteins can transform many immortal cells to a tumorigenic state and are thus known to have oncogenic potential (26Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A.

Indeed, activating mutations in ras are found in >30% of human cancers (24Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Despite its role as an oncogene, transduction of H-RasV12 induces a senescence program in normal human and rodent cells (9Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

H-RasV12-induced senescent cells share many features with cells that have undergone replicative senescence. These include flat and enlarged morphology, the induction of specific markers associated with senescence, including elevated senescence-associated (SA) 2The abbreviations used are: SA, senescence-associated; SAHF, senescence-associated heterochromatic foci; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; WT, wild type; GOFp53, gain-of-function p53. -β-galactosidase and senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) formation, as well as the induction of cell cycle regulators, such as p16, p53, and p21 (9Serrano M.

These studies indicate that the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway is linked to a senescence program in normal human cells. Moreover, the p16/Rb tumor suppressor pathway is crucial for Ras-mediated senescence in normal human fibroblasts. We have recently shown that transduction of H-RasV12 induces a permanent growth inhibition in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (36Bihani T. Mason D.X. Jackson T.J. Chen S.C. Boettner B. Lin A.W. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to normal human fibroblasts, U2OS cells undergo H-RasV12-induced growth inhibition in the absence of p16 (34Brookes S. Rowe J. Ruas M. Llanos S. Clark P.A. Lomax M. James M.C. Vatcheva R.

Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 715-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggest that an alternative senescence-like program can be activated by Ras signaling to suppress tumor cell growth (36Bihani T. Mason D.X. Jackson T.J. Chen S.C. Boettner B. Lin A.W. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the current study, the potential for activated Ras signaling to induce tumor senescence is investigated in various human carcinoma cell lines. To gain insight into the molecular basis of Ras-induced tumor senescence, an RNA interference approach was used to determine the roles of important cell cycle regulators involved. Our findings uncover a potentially novel tumor suppression program induced by activated Ras signaling. Cell Culture—Phoenix retrovirus packaging cell line (ATCC), human breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB468 (ATCC), MDA-MB231 (ATCC), and MCF7 (ATCC) and human pancreatic carcinoma cells MIA-PaCa2 (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and antibiotics. Human colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line (ATCC) and human bladder carcinoma T24 cell line (ATCC) were cultured in McCoy's 5A (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Retroviral Gene Transfer—The following retroviral vectors were used: pBabe-puro and its derivatives expressing H-RasV12 (9Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar), MEKQ56P, or wild-type MEK. Retroviral gene transfer was performed as previously described (28Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Retroviral constructs (pLXSN.neo) expressing E7 or an empty vector control were kindly provided by Dr. G. Ferbeyre at the University of Montreal (38Mallette F.A. Goumard S. Gaumont-Leclerc M.F. Moiseeva O. Ferbeyre G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, helper virus-free retroviruses were produced by Phoenix retrovirus packaging cells and were used to infect target cells. Stably transduced cell populations were established by selection in puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) or G418 (400 μg/ml). For RNA interference, the following retroviral vectors containing shRNAs were used: MSCV and its derivatives expressing p21shRNA, p130shRNA, and RbshRNA (31Narita M. Nunez S. Heard E. Narita M.

Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Following selection in puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) and verification of knockdown, cells were transduced with H-RasV12 (H-RasV12-pWzl-hygro) or an empty vector control (pWzl-hygro) followed by selection in hygromycin (200 μg/ml for MCF7 cells and 100 μg/ml for MDA-MB468 cells). Growth Curve Analyses—Growth curves were generated by plating cells (in duplicate) in 12-well dishes at 2 × 104 cells/well on day 0 post-selection. Total viable cell number was counted at 2, 4, and 8 days post-plating using a Coulter Counter (Beckman). To obtain a value for time zero, cells were trypsinized 6 h after plating and counted. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and results are displayed as a line graph (with standard deviation) showing the -fold increase in total cell number as compared with values obtained at time zero. BrdUrd Incorporation Assays—BrdUrd incorporation was carried out as previously described with minor modifications (29Lin A.W. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5025-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from each cell type were plated into chamber culture slides (Falcon). The next day, cells were pulsed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) for 30 min. After pulsing, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and denatured. BrdUrd incorporation was measured by immunofluorescence using an anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Pharmingen). Alexa Fluor Conjugate 488 (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody, and the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). The stained cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss), and at least 200 cells were scored for BrdUrd incorporation. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the results are displayed as percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells (with standard deviation) in a histogram. Colony Formation Assay—Cells of each cell type were plated in 6-well dishes (5 × 103 cells/well for MCF7 cells and MDA-MB231 cells, 1 × 103 cells/well for MDA-MB468, HCT116, and T24 cells) and cultured for at least 2 weeks prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma). Each cell type was plated in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times independently. Representative data are presented. SA-β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—SA-β-galactosidase activity was measured as previously described (30Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde. After fixation, cells were incubated in a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining solution at pH 6.0. The results were documented using a charge-coupled device camera attached to a phase-contrast microscope. SAHF Formation—SAHF formation was detected as previously described (31Narita M. Nunez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in chamber slides with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with DAPI, and documented using a charge-coupled device camera attached to a fluorescence microscope. Western Blot Analyses—Western blot analysis was carried out using total cell lysates resuspended in Laemmli buffer as previously described (9Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit. Samples containing 20 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE analysis and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.2% Tween-phosphate-buffered saline and blotted with the indicated antibodies. The following antibodies were used: p16 (C20, Delta BioLabs), p21 (C19, Santa Cruz), p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz), Rb (BD Pharmingen), Cyclin A (BF683, Santa Cruz), c-H-ras (Oncogene), pMAPK (E10 and p44/42, New England Biolabs), MEK (12-B, Santa Cruz), topoisomerase IIα (Oncogene), p107 (C18, Santa Cruz), p130 (C20, Santa Cruz), and α-tubulin (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) or anti-rabbit antibodies (Pierce) were used as secondary antibodies. The signals were detected using chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce). All Western blot analyses were repeated at least three times independently. Representative data are presented. Human Breast Carcinoma Cell Lines Undergo a Permanent Growth Arrest upon the Activation of the Ras/MEK/MAPK Pathway—Our recent studies demonstrated that human U2OS osteosarcoma cells undergo permanent growth arrest upon the transduction of H-RasV12, raising the possibility that Ras signaling can activate a cell cycle control program to inhibit the growth of tumor cells (36Bihani T. Mason D.X. Jackson T.J. Chen S.C. Boettner B. Lin A.W. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Considering that >90% of human cancers are carcinomas, it is important to determine whether this growth inhibition can also be achieved in human carcinoma cells. To address this question, human breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB468 and MCF7, were transduced with H-RasV12 or an empty vector via retroviral gene transfer, as previously described (9Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar, 28Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 29Lin A.W. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5025-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in contrast to the vector controls, both MDA-MB468 and MCF7 cells transduced with H-RasV12 exhibit senescence-like flat and enlarged cell morphology, 4 days after selection (Fig. 1A). Cells transduced with H-RasV12 also exhibit reduced BrdUrd incorporation when compared with the vector controls, suggesting that DNA synthesis is inhibited in these cells (Fig. 1B). Colony formation assays show that both MDA-MB468 and MCF7 cells transduced with H-RasV12 fail to form colonies in comparison with cells transduced with the vector controls (Fig. 1C). All of the cells remain viable in culture for several weeks, without significant cell death (data not shown). Furthermore, both MDA-MB468 cells and MCF7 cells transduced with H-RasV12 exhibit elevated SA-β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that both human breast carcinoma cell lines undergo a senescence-like permanent growth arrest upon the transduction of H-RasV12. To gain insight into the molecular basis of H-RasV12-induced permanent growth arrest in human breast carcinoma cells, we performed Western blot analyses to examine the expression pattern of important cell cycle regulators in these cells (Fig. 1E). The Rb tumor suppressor plays an essential role in regulating G1-S transition during cell cycle progression (43Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) and is crucial for H-RasV12-mediated senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts (31Narita M.

Wei S. Dutriaux A. Sedivy J.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MDA-MB468 cells do not express Rb, while the expression of Rb proteins is dramatically reduced in MCF7 cells transduced with H-RasV12, when compared with the vector control (Fig. 1E). The p16 CDK inhibitor regulates cell cycle progression through the Rb pathway (45Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 46Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G. Bartek J. Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). In normal human cells, p16 plays an essential role in senescence, including replicative senescence and H-Ras V12-induced senescence (34Brookes S. Rowe J. Ruas M. Llanos S. Clark P.A. Lomax M.

Peters G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MCF7 cells do not express p16, whereas the expression levels of wild-type p16 in MDA-MB468 cells is not up-regulated but, in fact, slightly down-regulated upon the transduction of H-RasV12 (Fig. 1E). These data are in stark contrast to H-RasV12-induced senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts, and demonstrate that H-RasV12-mediated tumor senescence can occur in the absence of p16 or Rb. Topoisomerase IIα is essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation (49Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1987; 50: 917-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 50Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), and a marked reduction of topoisomerase IIα is highly specific in senescent cells (51Mason D.X. Jackson T.J. Lin A.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observed growth inhibition, both MDA-MB468 and MCF7 cells transduced with H-RasV12 express reduced levels of topoisomerase IIα when compared with the vector controls (Fig. 1E). The p53 protein plays a crucial role in transcription and cell cycle control (52Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) and is the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor in human cancers (53Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C.

MDA-MB468 cells harbor a hemizygous “gain-of-function” mutant p53 (GOFp53), which is highly expressed and is considered to be an oncoprotein associated with malignancy (55van Oijen M.G. Slootweg P.J.

Interestingly, transduction of H-RasV12 in MDA-MB468 cells results in a significant down-regulation of the GOFp53 (Fig. 1E).

To identify residues on the intracellular face of the human C5a receptor that are involved in G protein activation, we performed a genetic analysis of each of the three intracellular loops and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptor. Amino acid substitutions were randomly incorporated into each loop, and functional receptors were identified in yeast. The third intracellular loop contains the largest number of preserved residues (positions resistant to amino acid substitutions), followed by the second loop, the first loop, and lastly the carboxyl terminus. Surprisingly, complete removal of the carboxyl-terminal tail did not impair C5a receptor signaling. When mapped onto a three-dimensional structural model of the inactive state of the C5a receptor, the preserved residues reside on one half of the intracellular surface of the receptor, creating a potential activation face.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; 3AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; C5a, complement factor 5a; C5aR, complement factor 5a receptor; CT, carboxyl terminus; CT1, first half of the carboxyl terminus; CT2, second half of the carboxyl terminus; CXCR4, chemokine receptor 4; Endo-Hf, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IC1, intracellular loop 1; IC2, intracellular loop 2; IC3, intracellular loop 3; IP3, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate; m5R, m5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RSM, random saturation mutagenesis; TM, transmembrane; W5Cha, hexapeptide agonist of the C5a receptor; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. are seven transmembrane (TM)-spanning proteins that play important roles in many diverse signaling processes, including olfaction, vision, taste, chemotaxis, and yeast cell mating. GPCRs activate signaling cascades by transmitting a signal to heterotrimeric G proteins composed of a Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunit. Upon ligand binding, the GPCR acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor through a conformational change that is transmitted to Gα-GDP, leading to GTP exchange for GDP. Gα-GTP then dissociates from Gβγ, and both Gα-GTP and Gβγ can transmit the signal to downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and ion channels. Activation of these second messengers can lead to a wide variety of physiological responses. GPCRs are one of the largest protein families in nature and are found in nearly all organisms from yeast to human. An estimated 1% of the human genome encodes GPCRs and ∼30% of all pharmaceutical drugs target these receptors (1Miller K.J. Murphy B.J. Pelleymounter M.A. Curr. Drug. Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2004; 3: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The GPCR family of proteins can be divided into three major subgroups based on sequence similarity (2Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The largest subgroup is the rhodopsin-like family (class A), whose prototypical member, rhodopsin, is the only GPCR for which a crystal structure has been solved (3Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T.

Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). This family of receptors is distinguished by a set of 20 highly conserved amino acids near the cytoplasmic side of the TM core. The DRY motif, found in this region at the TM3-second intracellular loop junction, is essential for G protein activation (8Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

The intracellular and extracellular loop regions of GPCRs within the same family contain the most sequence diversity. The extracellular loops presumably require distinct sequences to accommodate a diverse set of ligands. However, the reason for the lack of homology among intracellular loops of receptors that couple to similar G proteins, and presumably activate them through a similar mechanism, is less clear. This lack of homology makes it extremely difficult to use bioinformatics to predict residues required for signaling as well as the G protein(s) to which a given receptor may couple. Thus, a large scale genetic approach is necessary to understand G protein coupling and activation. Despite intense focus on GPCRs it is still not known how they dock to G proteins and catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP. A wide variety of techniques have been applied to the study of how GPCRs function as receptor switches for G protein binding and activation. These include peptide competition (11Konig B. Arendt A.

Although results differ depending on which GPCR is studied, the consensus is that intracellular loops 2 and 3 (IC2 and IC3) are critical for signaling and that the DRY motif of rhodopsin-like receptors is essential (8Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intracellular structural determinants that mediate GPCR signaling, we performed random saturation mutagenesis (RSM) screens targeting each of the individual intracellular loops (IC1, IC2, and IC3) as well as the carboxyl terminus (CT) of the human C5a receptor (C5aR). The C5aR, a member of the rhodopsinlike family, binds the 74-amino acid complement-derived C5a peptide and is involved in chemotaxis and activation of leukocytes. The C5aR exhibits 20% sequence identity and 35% sequence homology with bovine rhodopsin and has similarly sized loop regions, indicating that it may adopt a similar structure. We have previously used RSM to identify functional residues in the C5aR extracellular loops (29Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Klco J.M. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol.

RSM is a powerful structure-function analysis tool, because it introduces many unbiased amino acid substitutions and allows one to infer the relative importance of each residue within a region judged by the ability of that position to tolerate mutations. This study provides one of the most comprehensive functional maps of the intracellular face of any GPCR. In addition, these data, combined with our previous RSM screens of the extracellular loops (29Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Klco J.M. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol.

Library Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Silent restriction sites were engineered at the approximate boundaries of the intracellular loops IC1 (MluI and NdeI), IC2 (PstI and SfiI), or IC3 (BspEI and HindIII) of the C5aR ORF cloned into the pBS-SK Bluescript vector. The carboxyl terminus was divided into two regions, CT1 (FseI and BspEI) and CT2 (BspEI and XbaI), because of its large size. To prevent contamination by wild-type receptor in the libraries, a piece of non-receptor DNA was inserted between MluI and NdeI for IC1 and PstI and SfiI for IC2, and premature stop codons were inserted into the IC3 loop and the CT1 and CT2 regions. The following oligonucleotides were used (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), where the underlined region denotes bases randomly doped at a 20% non-wild-type nucleotide substitution rate: IC1, 5′-TATAACGCGTTGGTTGTTTGGGTTACTGCTTTTGAAGCTAAAAGAACTATTAATGCCATATGG-3′; IC2, 5′-TATACTGCAGATCGTTTTCTACTAGTTTTTAAACCAATTTGGTGTCAAAATTTTCGTGGGGCCGGCTTGGCCAAG-3′; IC3, 5′-TATATCCGGACTTGGTCTAGAAGAGCTACTAGATCTACTAAAACTTTGAAAGTTGTTGTTGCTGTTGTTGCAAGCTTG-3′; CT1, 5′-ATAGTGGCCGGCCAAGGTTTTCAAGGTAGATTGAGAAAATCTTTGCCATCTTTGCTCCGGAG-3′; and CT2, 5′-ATACTCCGGAATGTTTTGACTGAAGAATCTGTTGTTAGAGAATCTAAATCTTTTACTAGATCTACTGTTGATACTATGGCTCAAAAAACTCAAGCTGTCTAGACA-3′. Oligonucleotides were mutually primed by palendromic sequences at their 3′-ends, and complementary sequences were generated by Klenow extension. The double-stranded regions were then cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the C5aR gene in the pBS-SK Bluescript vector. The complexity and quality of the libraries were then determined by sequencing ten unselected receptors. The mutant receptors were subsequently subcloned into an ADE2 yeast expression vector. Single point mutations were made by designing complementary oligonucleotides encoding the desired mutation. A two-step PCR strategy was used to introduce the point mutation into the wild-type C5aR coding sequence in an ADE2 yeast expression vector. YFP-tagged receptors were made by subcloning point mutations into a C5aR-YFP fusion construct containing YFP at the carboxyl terminus. All point mutations were confirmed by sequencing at the Washington University Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory. The RGS4 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Maurine Linder. Yeast Strains—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY1142 has been previously described (32Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, the genotype is MATα far1Δ1442 tbt1-1 fus1::PFUS1-HIS3 can1 ste14:: trp1::LYS2 ste3Δ1156 gpa1 (41)-Gαi3 lys2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2. This strain, modified from CY1141 (34Klein C. Paul J.I. Sauve K. Schmidt M.M. Arcangeli L. Ransom J. Trueheart J. Manfredi J.P. Broach J.R. Murphy A.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1334-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), expresses a fusion of the amino-terminal 41 amino acids of the yeast Gα protein, Gpa1, followed by residues 34–354 of human Gαi3. Activation of the C5aR leads to signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and expression of the PFUS1-HIS3 reporter gene, allowing the yeast to grow in the absence of histidine. The BY1143 strain was created by transforming the BY1142 strain with a URA3 plasmid encoding C5a (pBN444) as previously described (29Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The BY1144 strain was created by transforming the BY1142 strain with an empty URA3 vector (pBN443). BY1173 has the genotype MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 can1 gpa1Δ::ade2Δ::3XHA far1Δ::ura3Δ fus1Δ::PFUS1-HIS3 LEU2::PFUS1-lacZ sst2Δ::ura3Δ ste2Δ::G418R trp1::GPA1/Gαi3 and has been previously described (35Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H. Watson M.A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). BY1173 contains a fusion of amino acids 1–467 of the yeast Gα protein, Gpa1, followed by the last 5 amino acids of human Gαi3. Activation of the C5aR leads to expression of a PFUS1-β-galactosidase reporter gene. Yeast Transformation and Functional Receptor Selection— Yeast transformations were done according to standard lithium acetate or electroporation protocols. Mutant receptors were screened by transforming BY1143 with the various ADE2 mutant libraries and plating on non-selective medium for 1 day. Functional receptors were then selected by replica plating onto histidine-deficient medium containing either 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) (Sigma) for IC1, IC2, and IC3 or 100 mm 3AT for the CT1 and CT2 libraries. The higher concentration of 3AT was used for the carboxyl terminus to try to isolate receptors that signal at a high level, because many mutations were tolerated in this region. Receptor-encoding plasmids were recovered from the yeast and retested for signaling by retransforming into BY1143. Approximately 30 functional receptors were selected in each screen, because this number has been shown to be sufficient to determine critical residues (29Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Klco J.M. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol.

Relative signaling abilities were assayed by restreaking three transformants of each mutant onto histidine-deficient medium containing varying amounts of 3AT (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm). Signaling levels were compared with wild-type C5aR expressed from an ADE2 plasmid, pBN482 (grows on up to 5 mm 3AT), and a non-functional mutant C5aR containing a stop codon in TM3, pBN483 (does not grow on 1 mm 3AT), which were previously described (32Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Growth in the absence of histidine was inferred to be dependent on C5aR signaling based on colony color (red colonies lack the C5aR ADE2 plasmid). Plasmids encoding functional receptors were sequenced at the Washington University Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory. All functional mutants were assessed for constitutive activity by expressing them in BY1144, which lacks a ligand, and replica plating on varying amounts of 3AT (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm). Receptor Expression Levels—Expression levels of RSM mutants and single point mutants were determined by Western blot. Overnight cultures of yeast carrying an empty ADE2 vector, or pBN482 encoding the wild-type C5aR, or plasmids encoding mutants were grown in liquid synthetic dropout medium-Ade. The A600 was determined and cultures were adjusted to A600 = 10.0. Cells harvested from 1 ml of adjusted cultures were lysed in 200 μl of 1 × sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol supplemented with 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with glass beads by vortexing for 5 min at room temperature. Lysates were heated for 5 min at 50 °C. 25 μl of each lysate was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-C5aR antibody raised against residues 9–29 of the amino terminus. Blots of YFP-tagged receptors were immunoblotted instead with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All blots were then stripped in 0.2 n NaOH for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (AbCam) as a loading control. Fluorescent Microscopy—BY1142-expressing YFP-tagged receptors was grown in liquid culture overnight, and live yeast were placed on a microscope slide. Images were recorded using a Zeiss color AxioCam HRc mounted on a Zeiss Axioscope microscope equipped with a Zeiss CP-Achromat 100× objective using a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. β-Galactosidase Assays—BY1173 was transformed with wild-type or single point mutant receptors and treated with a range of concentrations (10-10 m to 10-5 m) of the C5aR hexapeptide agonist W5Cha (Genscript), which unlike C5a can cross the yeast cell wall. Three independent transformants were used for each receptor, and assays were performed in triplicate as previously described (29Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase Treatment and Western Blots—Single point mutants that showed impaired signaling in the yeast system were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and transiently transfected into HEK293 cells by standard calcium phosphate methods. Cells were lysed 2 days after transfection in 250 μl of 1 × sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by shearing through a 27-gauge syringe. Lysates were heated for 5 min at 50 °C. 27 μl of each lysate was treated with 1000 units of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-maltose-binding protein fusion (Endo-Hf, New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 3 h. Samples were heated for 5 min at 50 °C, resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-C5aR antibody raised against residues 9–29 of the amino terminus. Blots were then stripped in 0.2 n NaOH for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (AbCam) as a loading control. Inositol 1,4,5-Triphosphate Accumulation—Single point mutants in pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and human Gα16 in pcDNA3.1(+) were transiently co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with 0.1 μm or 1 μm W5Cha (GenScript) or no ligand, and IP3 levels were measured as previously described (29Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined using a one-way analysis of variance test with Dunnett's post test and a 95% confidence level (GraphPad). Molecular Modeling—Generally, molecular modeling procedures were as described earlier (36Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3780-3789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All loops were mounted on the “template,” i.e. on a three-dimensional structure of the TM region of C5aR based on the x-ray structure of rhodopsin (PDB entry 1F88). TM helical fragments of C5aR were defined by sequence homology to the rhodopsin helices found by the ClustalW procedure (ca.expasy.org/tools) as follows: TM1, Ile38–Val50–Ala63 (the first, middle, and last residues, respectively); TM2, Asn71–Leu84–Gln98; TM3, Ala107–Ala122–Val138; TM4, Ala150–Trp161–Phe172; TM5, Glu199–Phe211–Phe224; TM6, Arg236–Phe251–Phe267; and TM7, Leu281–Tyr290–Tyr300. The helical fragments were assembled into a TM helical bundle by following the procedure of “enhanced homology modeling” previously described in detail (37Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R.

Only trans conformations of Pro residues were considered, and residues Arg, Lys, Glu, and Asp were present as charged species. Geometrical sampling of the individual loops was performed from the smallest loop to the largest, i.e. from IC1 to IC2 to IC3. As soon as the resulting structures of the smaller loops were selected, the loop structure closest to the average spatial positions of the Cα atoms was included in the template, providing additional geometrical limitations for the larger loops. The sampling was, basically, a stepwise elongation of the loop covering all combinations of the possible backbone conformations for the stepwise growing loops, i.e. fragments 63–71 (IC1), 138–150 (IC2), 224–236 (IC3), and 300–310, the latter fragment representing the “minimal-length” carboxyl terminus as was found by the carboxyl-terminal screen (Fig. 6). Starting conformations of individual residues and overall sampling procedure were as described earlier (36Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3780-3789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with limitations on the residue-residue contacts within the loop (Cα–Cα distances ≥4 Å), on the contacts between the loop and the template (Cα–Cα distances ≥6 Å); the values of coefficients EL and DEL were 3.0 and 0.0, respectively (see Ref. 36Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3780-3789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Elongation steps were as follows: a single step from residue 60 to residue 74 for IC1; from 138 to 146 to 148 to 150 for IC2, from 224 to 232 to 234 to 236 for IC3, and from 300 to 310 for the last fragment. After geometrical sampling selected all potentially loop-closing conformations for a specific loop, the selected structures were subjected to energy minimization employing the ECEPP/2 force field; the dielectric constant was set at 80 to mimic to some extent the water environment of the protruding loops. All parameters employed for energy minimization were as described previously (36Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3780-3789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Energy calculations yielded 23 low energy structures (those with relative energy ΔE = E - Emin ≤ 10 kcal/mol), which formed a single cluster of similar structures (defined by an r.m.s.d. value of ≤2 Å, Cα atoms only) for IC1; 90 structures within ΔE ≤ 18 kcal/mol falling into 21 different clusters for IC2; 25 structures within ΔE ≤ 12 kcal/mol falling into 3 different clusters for IC3; and 3 clusters for possible spatial arrangements of fragment 300–310. The elevated energy cut-off for IC2 was used to compensate for an energy gap of ∼6 kcal/mol between the lowest energy structure and the second lowest energy one, which otherwise might cause a drastic decrease of the number of selected low energy conformations. The lowest energy conformers in each cluster were selected as representatives for further consideration in the intracellular package comprising all combinations of conformations for IC1 + IC2 + IC3 + fragment 300–310 (189 combinations). Then, for all combinations of representatives, energy calculations were performed with the same limitations as those described earlier (36Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3780-3789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fifty-six combinations were finally selected by an energy cut-off of 30 kcal/mol; they were div"

In addition, overexpression of M-CSF and FMS results in the development of preneoplastic changes and has been associated with several types of human cancers, e.g. breast, uterine, and ovarian (6Kirma N.

These studies strongly suggest that small molecule inhibitors of FMS may prevent macrophage accumulation and suppress inflammatory responses in therapeutically important diseases. FMS is a member of the receptor-tyrosine kinase family (RTK) and is comprised of an extracellular ligand-binding domain joined through a single membrane spanning helix to a cytoplasmic domain, composed of a juxtamembrane domain and a kinase domain (Fig. 1). The kinase domain is split by a large insertion of about 70 amino acids termed the kinase insert domain (KID). Deletion or mutation of this region in FMS revealed that the KID is not necessary for intrinsic activity but may be important for receptor internalization and degradation and for protein-protein interaction during signal transduction (10Reedijk M.

Binding of M-CSF to the extracellular domain of FMS induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop and in non-catalytic regions. Tyr807 (Tyr809 in human) constitutes a major autophosphorylation site and may be important for full activation of the receptor (12Roussel M.F. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Flexible domains can be a hindrance to crystallization and have often been deleted to generate a non-physiological subdomain more likely to crystallize. Deletion of the large KID of VEGFR2 and of FLT3 did not affect intrinsic activity but was crucial in obtaining quality diffracting crystals (20McTigue M.A. Wickersham J.A. Pinko C. Showalter R.E.

In a different approach, a flexible domain can be replaced with the more structurally characterized domain of a homolog protein by protein engineering, resulting in a chimera more suitable for structural studies. Replacement of the membrane anchoring domain of thromboxane A2 with the corresponding region of the structurally characterized P450 2C5 has been very successful in converting a membrane bound protein into a soluble chimera suitable for crystallization trials (31Hsu P.Y. Wang L.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 416: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Several human chimera hemoglobin subunits have also been engineered and made structural studies successful (32Shirai T. Fujikake M. Yamane T. Inaba K. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Mol.

This article describes the strategy used to design optimal constructs for the crystallization and structure determination of the cytoplasmic domain of FMS. FMS was engineered into chimera proteins more suitable for crystallization trials. The modification included deletion of residues 922-972 and replacement of the FMS KID with the shorter KID of the previously crystallized RTKs, FGFR and TIE2. In addition to protein engineering, a thermal stability assay was conducted to monitor solution-dependent changes in protein stability and aggregation. The stabilizing conditions that were identified were incorporated into the FMS purification protocol to limit aggregation and improve yields. This work resulted in the successful crystal structure determination of FMS for use in the design and identification of FMS inhibitors. As inhibition of FMS kinase has broad clinical potential, the structure of this receptor will provide an important tool for structure-based design of FMS inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Materials—Oxindole, Indiburin-3′ monoxime, and AG1433 were purchased from Calbiochem. AG213 and SU4312 were purchased from Tocris. Cloning—All polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed with PfuUltra Hotstart DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). The products were separated on 8% agarose, gel-purified with GENECLEAN SPIN kits (Qbiogene, Inc) and cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). After sequence confirmation, the inserts were subcloned into pDEST vector for baculovirus expression (Invitrogen). The cytoplasmic domains of human FMS from amino acids 538-972 and 538-922 were cloned from human PC-3 cells by reverse transcriptase PCR. Oligos for PCR were designed with a SalI site and start Met prior to the FMS sequence at the 5′-end and a NotI site at the 3′-end for subcloning. PCR fragments were subcloned into a modified pDEST vector with a C-terminal His6 tag (Table 1). Chimera constructs were generated by overlapping PCR using the FMS 538-972 region as a template, and the middle fragment, which replaced the FMS KID, was synthesized (Sigma Genosys).TABLE 1FMS constructs generated and purification yields for each constructConstructN-term tagaN-term tag with TEV cleavage site: MHHHHHHENLYFQGVD.FMS sequenceKIDC-term tagbC-term tag: AAAHHHHHH.Yieldsmg/literFMS.538-972.6His538-972-X2-3FMS.538-922.6His538-922-X2-36His.FMS.560-922X560-922-0.16His.FMS.565-922X565-922-0.16His.FMS.570-922X570-922-0.16His.FMS.538-922(FGFR)X538-678, 753-922FGFRcFGFR:RPPGLEYSYNPSHNPEEQLSS.2-36His.FMS.538-922(TIE2)X538-678, 753-922TIE2dTIE2:SRVLETDPAFAIANSTAPT.2-36His.FMS.538-922(IR)X538-678, 753-922IReIR:SLRPEAENNPGRPP.1FMS.565-922(FGFR).6His565-678, 753-922FGFRcFGFR:RPPGLEYSYNPSHNPEEQLSS.X0.1FMS.565-922(TIE2).His6565-678, 753-922TIE2dTIE2:SRVLETDPAFAIANSTAPT.X0.1FMS.565-922(IR).6His565-678, 753-922IReIR:SLRPEAENNPGRPP.X0.1a N-term tag with TEV cleavage site: MHHHHHHENLYFQGVD.b C-term tag: AAAHHHHHH.c FGFR:RPPGLEYSYNPSHNPEEQLSS.d TIE2:SRVLETDPAFAIANSTAPT.e IR:SLRPEAENNPGRPP. Open table in a new tab To generate FMS chimera proteins with a cleavable His tag at the N terminus, constructs were modified by PCR to generate a SalI site with Val/Asp reading frame at the 5′-end and a NotI site at the 3′-end after a stop codon. PCR fragments were sub-cloned into a modified pDEST vector with an N-terminal His6 tag and TEV cleavage site, followed by a SalI site (Table 1). All other constructs were generated by PCR and subcloned into the modified N-terminal His tag pDEST vector at the SalI/NotI sites resulting in proteins shown in Table 1. Baculovirus Expression—All FMS constructs were expressed in Sf9 cells using Invitrogen Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System per the manual (Invitrogen). Cell Culture—Sf9 cells were grown in ESF921 media (Expression Systems) at 27 °C. Recombinant Production of FMS—Large scale expression was carried out in either 2-liter shake flasks or 25-liter WAVE bioreactors. Cells were maintained at no more than 4 × 106 cells/ml during growth and were monitored for >95% viability by Trypan Blue exclusion. For expression, cells were subcultured to a density of 1.6 × 106 cells/ml and infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At the time of infection fetal bovine serum (Mediatech) was supplemented at a final concentration of 2%. Four hours post-infection the growth temperature was reduced to 24 °C. Cells were harvested 72-h post-infection at 1600 × g for 10 min. Viabilities were determined by Guava ViaCount or Trypan Blue and routinely were between 70 and 80% at time of harvest. Cell pellets were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors and stored at -80 °C. Small Scale Purification to Evaluate Constructs—TheÁKTA Explorer System (GE Healthcare) was used for all purification processes. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Thermal stability measurements were used to optimize the buffer components of the small scale purification protocol as described under “Discussion.” Frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm KH2PO4-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm BME, 5 mm imidazole, 1× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Resuspended cells were dounce-homogenized and mechanically lysed with an Emulsiflex-C5 (Avestin) at 10,000-15,000 psi. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The cleared lysate was filtered through a 0.45-μm vacuum filter and mixed gently with BD Talon metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences Clontech) overnight at 4 °C. The resin was packed into a XK column (GE Healthcare) and washed with 10-20 column volumes of buffer A, containing 10 mm imidazole followed by 10-15 column volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. FMS was then eluted using a 10 column volume linear gradient from 10 mm to 200 mm imidazole in buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing FMS were pooled and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 HR 10/30, GE Healthcare). Expression yields were determined by Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar), using the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer's instruction with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Large Scale Purification for Crystallization Trials—The large scale purification (from 25-30 liters of cell culture) was used to purify protein for crystallization trials. The initial steps of the purification (cell lysis and affinity purification) were performed as described for the small scale purification protocol. After affinity elution, fractions containing FMS were pooled and combined with 0.2 units of TEV Protease (Invitrogen) for each μg of FMS to remove the histidine tag. The reaction was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm KH2PO4-NaOH buffer pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm glutathione, using a Spectra/Por1 membrane (with a 6-8,000 Da cut-off molecular size) for simultaneous tag removal and buffer exchange. Cleavage of the histidine tag was monitored by SDS-PAGE. After complete cleavage, FMS was incubated with 200 μl of BD Talon metal affinity resin for 2 h to remove TEV protease and the remaining histidine tag. At this stage, the yields were ∼ 3 mg/liters of induced cell culture, and the protein was nearly 80% pure. Purified FMS was then filtered through a 0.2-μm cartridge filter, concentrated to 2 mg/ml using an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter unit (10-kDa molecular mass cut-off, Millipore) and further purified on a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 HR 10/30, GE Healthcare) in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol. Fractions containing FMS were pooled, and the protein concentration determined spectrophotometrically on a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purified FMS was filtered through a 0.1-μm vacuum filter (Millipore), incubated with various FMS inhibitors and concentrated to a final concentration of 7-11 mg/ml using a Ultrafree membrane (10 kDa cut-off). At this stage the purity was >98% as determined by SDS-PAGE, and the protein was ready for crystallization trials. Sequence Alignment—Protein alignment was performed in ClustalW with standard parameters (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Limited Proteolysis—0.1 mg of purified C-terminally tagged full-length FMS cytoplasmic domain (FMS.538-972.6His) was digested with chymotrypsin (0.035 units), trypsin (0.7 μg), thermolysin (0.05 units), subtilisin (0.0003 units), clostripain (0.01 units), elastase (0.018 units), proteinase K (0.0003 units), endopeptidase Lys-C (0.01 units), endopeptidase Glu-C (0.01 units), and endopeptidase Arg-C (0.01 units). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 1 mm DTT, 200 mm NaCl, 3% glycerol. For thermolysin, 5 mm calcium chloride was included into the reaction buffer. Time points were taken at 15, 30, and 60 min for each enzyme by adding the SDS-PAGE loading dye and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The N terminus of proteolytic fragments was determined by N-terminal sequencing. The PeptideCutter tool of the ExPaSy molecular biology server program was used to estimate the C terminus of proteolytic fragments that were determined to be intact at the N terminus. N-terminal Sequencing and Peptide Mapping—Purified protein was run under denaturing conditions on a 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPage SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Invitrogen) and stained with 0.025% Coomassie R250, 40% methanol. N-terminal sequencing was done by Edman degradation by Midwest Analytical, St Louis, Mo. Peptide mapping was performed by M-Scan, Inc. Cationic Exchange—Charge homogeneity of purified protein was evaluated by cationic exchange on a Mono S HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare). The column was pre-equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 2 mm DTT, 3% glycerol. 50 μl of purified FMS at 1 mg/ml was diluted 10-fold in the equilibration buffer before injection onto Mono S. Protein was eluted using a 10 column volume gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in equilibration buffer. Activity and Inhibition by Well Known Kinase Inhibitors—The kinase inhibitors used for enzymatic characterization of the FMS constructs were purchased from Calbiochem (Oxindole, Indiburin-3′monoxime and AG1433) and from Tocris (AG213 and SU4312). Reagents used in the kinetic assay were purchased from PanVera. The activity of the purified proteins was determined by fluorescence polarization (FP) kinetic assays. In this assay format, a fluorescein-labeled phosphopeptide (typically named tracer) and phosphopeptides or phosphoproteins generated during the FMS reaction compete for binding to an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Phosphorylation of a Random Copolymer—A typical reaction solution contained 10 μg/ml poly (E4, Y), 10 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 ng/μl full length FMS cytoplasmic domain (FMS.538-972.6His), or 0.4 ng/μl FMS chimera in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and detection reagent (1:1:3 mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 10× protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) green tracer, 10× FP dilution buffer, respectively). A control lacking ATP was included in every experiment. The kinase reaction was followed for 60 min. Polarization was read on the Analyst (Molecular Devices) using 485-nm and 530-nm excitation and emission filters, respectively. FMS Autophosphorylation—The ability of the FMS chimeras to autophosphorylate was assessed as described above except that 100 μm ATP and 2 ng/μl of each chimera were used. Inhibition of purified proteins by commercially available kinase inhibitors was measured by an autophosphorylation fluorescence polarization end point assay. 10 nm of the FMS full-length cytoplasmic domain (FMS.538-972.6His) or chimera was incubated with compound, 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% (v/v) Tween-20, 2% Me2SO in a final volume of 10 μl. Control reactions were run in each plate. Assay buffer was substituted for the compound in positive and negative control wells. Positive control wells also received 6 mm EDTA. The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The reaction was quenched with 6mm EDTA, and then 10 μl of the detection reagent described above were added in each well. The fluorescence polarization was measured after 30 min of incubation. Under these conditions, the polarization values for positive and negative controls were ∼300 mP and ∼150 mP, respectively, and were used to define the 100 and 0% inhibition of the FMS reaction. The IC50 values reported are the averages of three independent measurements. Thermal Stability and Ligand Binding—ThermoFluor® was used to assess thermal stability of purified FMS and to measure ligand binding of several compounds (42Pantoliano M.W. Petrella E.C. Kwasnoski J.D. Lobanov V.S. Myslik J. Graf E. Carver T. Asel E. Springer B.A. Lane P. Salemme F.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6: 429-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This technique monitors changes in the fluorescent intensity of dyes such as 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (1,8-ANS). The fluorescent dyes are quenched in aqueous environments but increase in fluorescence on binding to the hydrophobic core of denatured proteins. Equilibrium binding ligands increase protein stability and the increase in protein melting temperature (Tm) is proportional to ligand concentration and affinity. Final melt conditions were 25 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml FMS, 100 μm 1,8-ANS. 4 μl of protein were dispensed into a well of a 384-well microplate and covered with 1 μl of silicon oil to prevent evaporation. Samples were heated at 1 °C/min. Assay plates were excited with a 390 ± 10 nm light. Emission was monitored at 470 ± 30 nm. Fluorescent intensity was measured every 1 °C as relative pixel intensity count for each well. Fluorescent intensity was plotted versus temperature and integrated to calculated melting temperatures. Construct Design Using Sequence Alignment and Limited Proteolysis—The initial construct containing the full-length cytoplasmic domain of FMS with the entire KID and a non-cleavable C-terminal His tag, FMS.538-972.6His, was generated. After expression and purification, protein yields were 2-3 mg/liter of cell culture (Table 1). Commercial (Hampton) and in-house crystallization screens were unsuccessful in producing crystals. To design a construct more suitable for crystallization, surface-exposed loops and unstructured domains that could be a hindrance to crystallization were identified by sequence alignment and limited proteolysis. The sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of FMS.538-972 (FMSCD) was aligned with the PDB sequence of three previously crystallized receptor-tyrosine kinases (PDB: 1FGK, 1IRK, 1FVR) (Fig. 3a) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These receptor-tyrosine kinases are similar to FMS in that they contain a KID splitting their kinase domain. FGFR, IR, and TIE2 have short KIDs that consist of 21, 16, and 19 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 3b). VEGFR2 and FLT3, also members of the receptor-tyrosine kinase family, have a much larger KID of around 80 amino acid residues. The large KIDs of VEGFR2 and FLT3 have been shown to be unstructured and their deletion was crucial for successful crystallization and structure determination (20McTigue M.A. Wickersham J.A. Pinko C. Showalter R.E. Parast C.V. Tempczyk-Russell A. Gehring M.R. Mroczkowski B. Kan C.C. Villafranca J.E. Appelt K.

Sequence alignment indicated that 60 residues out of the 70 amino acids composing the large KID of FMS do not align with the crystallography constructs of the other previously crystallized RTKs. In addition, FMS contains 32 residues preceding the conserved and structurally ordered catalytic core as well as a long C terminus (between 34 and 54 residues) following the last ordered amino acid of the other RTKs (Fig. 3a). Limited proteolysis was also used to help in the design of a stable construct more likely to crystallize. Various proteases were used for this study, some with narrow specificity such as trypsin, endoproteinase Lys-C, Glu-C, and some with broad specificity such as subtilisin and thermolysin. Experiments were performed on FMS.538-972.6His as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Most cleavage sites were observed within the large KID of FMS, indicating that the KID is most likely unstructured and surface exposed as had been predicted by sequence alignment (Fig. 1). Limited proteolysis with clostripain generated a 43-44 kDa b"
https://openalex.org/W2034987425,"Binding of full-length P160 coactivators to hormone response element-steroid receptor complexes has been difficult to investigate in vitro. Here, we report a new application of our recently described fluorescence anisotropy microplate assay to investigate binding and dissociation of full-length steroid receptor coactivator-1a (SRC1a) from full-length estrogen receptor α (ERα) or estrogen receptor β (ERβ) bound to a fluorescein-labeled (fl) estrogen response element (ERE). SRC1a exhibited slightly higher affinity binding to flERE·ERβ than to flERE·ERα. Binding of SRC1a to flERE·ERα and to flERE·ERβ was 17β-estradiol (E2)-dependent and was nearly absent when ICI 182,780, raloxifene, or 4-hydroxytamoxifen were bound to the ERs. SRC1a binds to flERE·E2-ERα and flERE·E2-ERβ complexes with a t½ of 15–20 s. Short LXXLL-containing nuclear receptor (NR) box peptides from P160 coactivators competed much better for SRC1a binding to flERE·E2-ER than an NR box peptide from TRAP220. However, ∼40–250-fold molar excess of the P160 NR box peptides was required to inhibit SRC1a binding by 50%. This suggests that whereas the NR box region is a primary site of interaction between SRC1a and ERE·E2-ER, additional contacts between the coactivator and the ligand-receptor-DNA complex make substantial contributions to overall affinity. Increasing amounts of NR box peptides greatly enhanced the rate of dissociation of SRC1a from preformed flERE·E2-ER complexes. The data support a model in which coactivator exchange is facilitated by active displacement and is not simply the result of passive dissociation and replacement. It also shows that an isolated coactivator exhibits an inherent capacity for rapid exchange.

Estrogens regulate the normal growth and differentiation of reproductive tissues, bone, and the nervous system and play an important role in human pathologies such as osteoporosis and breast, uterine, and liver cancer (1Cogliano V.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2803) Google Scholar). ER and other members of the steroid hormone receptor subfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs) share a common domain structure and overall scheme for transcriptional activation (7Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 8Katzenellenbogen B.S. Choi I. Delage-Mourroux R. Ediger T.R. Martini P.G. Montano M. Sun J. Weis K. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In the classical model for ER action, binding of estrogens enables the ER to dimerize and bind to specific canonical DNA sequences termed estrogen response elements (EREs). Transcriptional activation by ER is largely mediated by two interacting activation functions. Activation function 1, in the N-terminal A/B domain is important in ligand-independent transcription and activation function 2 in the C-terminal ligand binding domain is important in ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivators. The bound coactivators help assemble a dynamic, rapidly changing, multiprotein complex that facilitates both chromatin remodeling and formation of an active transcription complex (9Glass C.K.

When agonists are bound to ER, several ER helices align to form a hydrophobic cleft that is critical for coactivator binding. The long side chains in selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (the active metabolite of tamoxifen) and raloxifene (RAL), contact amino acids in helix 12 of the ER ligand binding domain and change the orientation of helix 12 so that helix 12, rather than coactivators, occupies the hydrophobic cleft (15Shiau A.K.

The steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) or P160 family of coactivators, consisting of SRC1/NCoA-1, SRC2/GRIP1/TIF2/NCoA2, and SRC3/ACTR/AIB1/p/CIP/RAC3/TRAM1, are perhaps the best known of the many coactivators implicated in ER-mediated transactivation (17Xu J. Li Q. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 18Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The P160 coactivators interact with the binding cleft in the ER ligand binding domain via highly conserved α-helical Leu-X-X-Leu-Leu (LXXLL) motifs, also called NR boxes. Most P160 proteins contain a central nuclear receptor-interacting domain made up of three NR boxes arranged in tandem. An alternatively spliced form of SRC1, called SRC1a, contains a fourth NR box at its C terminus (19Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Whereas the NR boxes are thought to play a key role in binding of P160 coactivators to ER, amino acid residues flanking this core motif are also important for ER recognition and binding specificity (20Chang C.

In addition, sequences in the N-terminal region of ER play a role in SRC1 binding (22Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M. Subramanian S. McKinerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In vivo, coactivators can interact with diverse proteins including the cointegrators p300/CREB-binding protein and PCAF (23McKenna N.J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The DRIP/TRAP/ARC multiprotein complex represents a second class of coactivator complex implicated in ER-mediated transactivation. This complex interacts with liganded ER AF2 via two LXXLL motifs in its DRIP205/TRAP220 subunit (27Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation results and other data suggest that the components of transcription complexes at EREs undergo rapid exchange and replacement. In a simplified formulation of this sequential model of coregulator exchange, the ER initially recruits an SRC·p300/CREB-binding protein·PCAF complex whose histone acetyltransferase activity acetylates nearby histones, altering the architecture of the promoter regions and enhancing promoter accessibility. The DRIP·TRAP·ARC complex then replaces the SRC·p300/CREB-binding protein·PCAF complex and additional proteins including DNA topoisomerase II, that are linked to the DNA repair machinery, are recruited to the complex prior to steroid receptor activation of transcription (9Glass C.K.

Addressing questions such as whether components of the complexes can actively displace each other or only enter the complex after the initial components have dissociated, and whether rapid exchange of coactivators is an intrinsic capacity or requires enzymatic modification of the coactivators, requires the development of suitable in vitro approaches. Previous in vitro studies of ER·P160 coactivator interactions primarily used NR box peptides and NRID-containing protein fragments (28Ozers M.S. Ervin K.M. Steffen C.L. Fronczak J.A. Lebakken C.S.

These studies suggest that LXXLL motifs may act only as docking points and that additional contacts outside of the NRID may be required for more complete binding, emphasizing the need to study these interactions with full-length proteins. In addition, because binding of ER to the ERE is thought to precede coactivator binding (37Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar), and the ERE also influences ER conformation and the ability of the ER to recruit coactivators (38Klinge C.M.

Perhaps because of instability, the tripartite complex composed of the ERE, ER, and P160 coactivator is not detected using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). In contrast to electrophoretic mobility shift assays, surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence anisotropy/fluorescence polarization assays provide real-time analysis of macromolecular interactions. Cheskis and co-workers (29Cheskis B.J. McKenna N.J. Wong C.W. Wong J. Komm B. Lyttle C.R. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

However, this important work did not involve a physically isolated P160 coactivator, or ER bound to EREs, and has not stimulated subsequent studies. Recently, we developed the fluorescence anisotropy/polarization microplate assay (FAMA) to analyze the interactions of steroid receptors with their DNA response elements in ultra low-volume microplates (46Wang S.Y.

In this assay, after excitation with polarized light, the relatively small fluorescein-labeled consensus ERE (flERE) undergoes rotational diffusion more rapidly than the time required for light emission. Therefore, the position of the flERE at the time of emission is largely randomized, resulting in depolarization of most of the emitted light (Fig. 1A). When the ER binds to the flERE, the larger size of the flERE·ER complex causes rotational diffusion to be slower, increasing the likelihood that the flERE·ER complex will be in the same plane at the time of emission as it was at the time of excitation. Therefore, the emitted light will be more highly polarized (Fig. 1B). This change is observed as an increase in fluorescence polarization, or the closely related parameter, fluorescence anisotropy. We also demonstrated that binding of anti-ERα antibodies to the flERE·ERα complex resulted in a further increase in anisotropy, suggesting that the utility of the FAMA could be extended to the study of ERE·ER·coregulator interactions (modeled in Fig. 1C). Results from earlier cuvette-based studies also suggested that the FAMA could be developed for studies of coregulator interactions (47Thenot S. Bonnet S. Boulahtouf A. Margeat E. Royer C.A. Borgna J.L. Cavailles V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2137-2150PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the FAMA provides a reliable in vitro assay for monitoring the binding of a full-length P160 coactivator, SRC1a, to flERE·ER complexes and for monitoring the dissociation of flERE·ER·SRC1 complexes. We analyzed the effects of estrogenic ligands and selective estrogen receptor modulators on SRC1 binding and the relative ability of several NR box peptides to block binding of full-length SRC1 to flERE·E2-ERα and flERE·E2-ERβ complexes. The ability of NR box peptides to stimulate dissociation of full-length SRC1a from preformed flERE·E2-ERα·SRC1a and flERE·E2-ERβ·SRC1a complexes suggests that rapid coactivator exchange results from active displacement of the coactivator from the receptor-DNA complex. Proteins and Peptides—Full-length FLAG epitope-tagged human ERα (ERα) and FLAG epitope-tagged human ERβ were expressed in the presence of 200 nm E2, purified in the presence of 20 nm E2, and quantitated as described previously (45Krieg A.J. Krieg S.A. Ahn B.S. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5025-5034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length FLAG epitope-tagged human SRC1a was purified as described (50Thackray V.G. Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Different preparations of SRC1a were used in the several experiments. Optimal binding of SRC1a to flERE·ER complexes was determined from saturation curves done with each preparation of SRC1a (data not shown). Different concentrations of SRC1a are therefore used in some experiments. The nuclear receptor interaction box 2 (NR-2) and box 4 (NR-4) peptides of SRC1 and the NR-2 peptide of TRAP-220 were synthesized by Abgent (San Diego, CA). The GRIP1 NR-2 peptide was a gift from Dr. Dean Edwards (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The amino acid sequences of the NR box peptides are as follows: SRC1 NR box 2, LTERHKILHRLLQE; SRC1 NR box 4, QAQQKSLLQQLLTE; SRC2/GRIP1 NR box 2, KHKILHRLLQDSS; TRAP-220 NR box 2, KNHPMLMNLLKDNP. The histone methyltransferase peptide (HMTP2) was a gift from Dr. Satish Nair (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). Its sequence is ARTKQTARKSTGGK. Oligonucleotides—A 30-bp oligonucleotide containing the cERE was synthesized with fluorescein (6-FAM) at its 5′ end using phosphoramidite chemistry and PolyPak II (Glen Research Corp., Sterling, VA) purified by the Biotechnology Center (University of Illinois). The sequence of this fluorescein-labeled sense strand, with the ERE half-sites underlined, is: 5′-fl-CTAGATTACAGGTCACAGTGACCTTACTCA-3′. A260 values were measured to calculate the oligonucleotide concentration. The ∼60% degree of fluorescein incorporation was determined as described (51Ozers M.S. Hill J.J. Ervin K. Wood J.R. Nardulli A.M. Royer C.A. Gorski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30405-30411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fluorescein-labeled sense strand was annealed with an equimolar concentration of the unlabeled antisense strand. Fluorescence Anisotropy Microplate Assays—FAMA was carried out with some modifications of our earlier methods (46Wang S.Y. Ahn B.S. Harris R. Nordeen S.K. Shapiro D.J. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 807-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescein-labeled double-stranded cERE was diluted to 1 nm in the anisotropy buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 ng of poly(dI-dC), 100 nm E2) and added to the wells of a black 96-well low-volume, high efficiency HE microplate (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). A concentration of human ER identified in preliminary studies as sufficient for saturated binding of human ER to the flERE probe (usually 15 nm) was added to the wells in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The reactions were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature in the dark. Anisotropy values were measured until the reactions reached equilibrium (usually within 15 min). SRC1a was diluted to appropriate starting concentrations in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mg/ml insulin (or bovine serum albumin). Our ongoing studies showed that the presence of Nonidet P-40 and EDTA had no effect and the Nonidet P-40 could be left out (data not shown). The indicated amounts of SRC1a were then added to wells containing the equilibrated flERE·ER binding reaction. The reactions were mixed by pipetting and incubating at room temperature in the dark. Anisotropy values were measured until the reactions reached equilibrium (within 10 min, see Fig. 4). Anisotropy changes resulting from SRC1a binding were calculated by subtracting the anisotropy values measured for the flERE·ER reactions from the values measured for the flERE·ER·SRC1a reactions. For studies of binding affinity, a percent bound value was calculated at each concentration of SRC1a using the simple expression: (anisotropy change/maximum anisotropy change) × 100. After plotting the percent probe bound versus SRC1a concentration, an apparent Kd was determined as the SRC1a concentration at which 50% of the flERE·ER complex was bound to SRC1a. Anisotropy measurements were made on the Ultra Evolution Multifunctional Microplate Reader (Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC), or on a more sensitive PHERAStar High-End Microplate Reader (BMG LabTech Inc., NC). Although outcomes were independent of the instrument used, because of different gain settings on the instruments, the magnitude of the anisotropy changes is not identical in the different figures. Unless otherwise indicated, Sigma Plot was used to fit the data and calculate data from the curves. Ligand Exchange Experiments—For ligand exchange experiments, a concentration of E2-ER that produces saturated binding to the flERE was added to the anisotropy buffer (plus 15 μg of bovine serum albumin to help stabilize the ERs and 100 nm of the indicated ligand) in the wells of the microplate. Following a 1-h incubation at room temperature, flERE was added to a concentration of 1 nm in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The reactions were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature. An amount of SRC1a required to achieve ∼90–100% of maximum binding of the flERE·ER complex was added and anisotropy was measured as described above. On Rate Experiments—For on rate experiments, a concentration of E2-ER that produces saturated binding to the flERE was added to the anisotropy buffer containing 1 nm flERE and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. A near saturating concentration of SRC1a (15 nm) was added to the pre-bound flERE·E2-ER complex in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Kinetic measurements were carried out at room temperature by taking anisotropy measurements at the indicated time points after SRC1a addition. The anisotropy change when binding reached a plateau at equilibrium was set equal to 100% binding. Peptide Competition—Peptide competition experiments used ER concentrations that achieved maximal binding of 1 nm flERE in the anisotropy buffer. The indicated amounts of peptide were added to equilibrated flERE·E2-ER binding reactions in a total reaction volume of 20 or 15 μl for the experiments comparing the SRC peptides and the TRAP-220 peptide, respectively, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. For competition experiments using peptides derived from SRCs, a concentration of SRC1a that produces ∼90–100% of maximal binding of the flERE·ER complex was added. For the TRAP-220 peptide, a concentration of SRC1a that produces ∼70–80% of maximal binding of the flERE·ER complex was added. Anisotropy measurements were made as described above. Data for the competition experiments were graphed by curve fitting with Sigma Plot (Figs. 5 and 7A).FIGURE 7TRAP-220 NR box 2 peptide is a weaker competitor than the SRC NR box peptides. A, 15 nm E2-ERα (filled circles) or E2-ERβ (open circles) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 nm flERE. After measuring fluorescence anisotropy, the indicated concentrations of TRAP-220 NR box 2 peptide were added and samples were incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. 8.3 and 6.4 nm purified, full-length SRC1a was added to the flERE·E2-ERα ± peptide and flERE·E2-ERβ ± peptide samples, respectively. The samples were incubated at room temperature and anisotropy measured. Anisotropy changes for binding of SRC1a to the flERE·E2-ERα and flERE·E2-ERβ complexes in the absence of added peptide were set equal to 100%. The data represents the average of at least three independent experiments ± S.D. 15 nm E2-ERα (B) or E2-ERβ (C) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 nm flERE. The same amounts of SRC1a as in A were added and samples were incubated at room temperature. TRAP-220 NR box 2 (filled circles) or HMTP2 peptide (filled squares) was added to 140 μm for flERE·E2-ERα·SRC1a (B) or 100 μm for flERE·E2-ERβ·SRC1a (C). The data at t = 0 was set equal to 100%. The data represents the average of at least three experiments. Because lower concentrations of SRC1a were used, the maximum anisotropy values were lower than in the other figures. The actual anisotropy values in A for flERE·E2-ER + peptide and flERE·E2-ER + SRC1 were 68 and 79 mA for the ERα complexes, respectively, and 61 and 89 mA for the ERβ complexes, respectively. In B, they were 74 and 86 mA units for the ERα complexes: – and + SRC1a at t = 0, respectively, and in C, they were 80 and 107 mA for the ERβ complexes – and + SRC1a at t = 0, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of SRC1a Exchange—Peptide-mediated dissociation experiments used the ER and SRC1a concentrations described above for the peptide competition experiments. Following equilibration, different peptide concentrations were added. The calculated anisotropy change before addition of peptide was set as the maximum anisotropy change at time 0. Kinetic measurements were carried out at room temperature (∼22 °C) by taking anisotropy measurements at the indicated time points after peptide addition. The Kaleidagraph® program was used to fit data collected from the NR box peptide and the control HMTP2 peptides with a logarithmic trend line for the NR box peptides and a linear trend line for the HMTP2 peptide. The SRC1 NR box 2 peptide exhibited intrinsic fluorescence that could in principle nonspecifically reduce anisotropy values and calculated anisotropy changes. However, inhibition results remained the same whether or not the data were corrected for background fluorescence of the peptide. In the exchange experiments it was important to show that dilution was sufficient to"
