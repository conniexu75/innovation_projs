https://openalex.org/W1970391453,"We have isolated and characterized several members of the P transposable element family from a Drosophila melanogaster P strain. Large 2.9 kb elements are present as multiple highly conserved copies together with smaller (0.5-1.6 kb), heterogeneous elements. The complete DNA sequences of the 2.9 kb element and four small elements (previously isolated from hybrid-dysgenesis-induced mutations of the white locus) have been determined. Each small element appears to have arisen from the 2.9 kb element by a different internal deletion. P elements have 31 bp perfect inverse terminal repeats and upon insertion duplicate an 8 bp sequence found only once at the site of insertion. Three of the insertions into the white locus occurred at the same nucleotide, indicating a high degree of local site specificity for insertion. The basis of this specificity has been investigated by DNA sequence analysis of the sites where 18 P elements are found. A revertant of one of the white locus mutants has been found to result from precise excision of the P element, restoring the wild-type DNA sequence."

It is active at extremely low dosage against a wide variety of nematode and arthropod parasites, apparently by virtue of its action on the mediation of neurotransmission by γ-aminobutyric acid. It is now in commercial use in various countries for the treatment and control of parasites in cattle, horses, and sheep, and is expected to become available for use in swine and dogs. Since studies with the drug in man are in a preliminary stage, it is not yet known whether ivermectin will be useful in human medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2078282757,The epithelium of nasal tissue excised from subjects with cystic fibrosis exhibited higher voltage and lower conductance than tissue from control subjects. Basal sodium ion absorption by cystic fibrosis and normal nasal epithelia equaled the short-circuit current and was amiloride-sensitive. Amiloride induced chloride ion secretion in normal but not cystic fibrosis tissue and consequently was more effective in inhibiting the short-circuit current in cystic fibrosis epithelia. Chloride ion-free solution induced a smaller hyperpolarization of cystic fibrosis tissue. The increased voltage and amiloride efficacy in cystic fibrosis reflect absorption of sodium ions across an epithelium that is relatively impermeable to chloride ions.
https://openalex.org/W1985345774,"DNA gyrase is the bacterial enzyme responsible for converting circular DNA to a negatively supercoiled form. We show that the synthesis of DNA gyrase is itself controlled by DNA supercoiling; synthesis is highest when the DNA template is relaxed. The rates of synthesis in vivo of both the A and B subunits of DNA gyrase are increased up to 10-fold by treatments that block DNA gyrase activity and decrease the supercoiling of intracellular DNA. Similarly, efficient synthesis of both gyrase subunits in a cell-free S-30 extract depends on keeping the closed circular DNA template in a relaxed conformation. The results suggest that DNA supercoiling in E. coli is controlled by a homeostatic mechanism. Synthesis of the RecA protein and several other proteins is also increased by treatments that relax intracellular DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1993762986,"Thirty-six isogenic D. melanogaster strains that differed only in the chromosomal location of a 7.2 or an 8.1 kb DNA segment containing the (autosomal) rosy gene were constructed by P-element-mediated gene transfer. Since the flies were homozygous for a rosy- allele, rosy gene function in these indicated the influence of flanking sequences on gene expression. The tissue distribution of XDH activity in all the strains was normal. Each line exhibited a characteristic level of adult XDH-specific activity. The majority of these values were close to wild-type levels; however, the total variation in specific activity among the lines was nearly fivefold. Thus position effects influence expression of the rosy gene quantitatively but do not detectably alter tissue specificity. X-linked rosy insertions were expressed on average 1.6 times more activity in males than in females. Hence the gene acquires at least partial dosage compensation upon insertion into the X chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1543261346,"In order to study the double-strand DNA passage reaction of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, a quantitative assay to monitor the enzymic conversion of supercoiled circular DNA to relaxed circular DNA was developed. Under conditions of maximal activity, relaxation catalyzed by the Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II was processive and the energy of activation was 14.3 kcal . mol-1. Removal of supercoils was accompanied by the hydrolysis of either ATP or dATP to inorganic phosphate and the corresponding nucleoside diphosphate. Apparent Km values were 200 microM for pBR322 plasmid DNA, 140 microM for SV40 viral DNA, 280 microM for ATP, and 630 microM for dATP. The turnover number for the Drosophila enzyme was at least 200 supercoils of DNA relaxed/min/molecule of topoisomerase II. The enzyme interacts preferentially with negatively supercoiled DNA over relaxed molecules, is capable of removing positive superhelical twists, and was found to be strongly inhibited by single-stranded DNA. Kinetic and inhibition studies indicated that the beta and gamma phosphate groups, the 2'-OH of the ribose sugar, and the C6-NH2 of the adenine ring are important for the interaction of ATP with the enzyme. While the binding of ATP to Drosophila topoisomerase II was sufficient to induce a DNA strand passage event, hydrolysis was required for enzyme turnover. The ATPase activity of the topoisomerase was stimulated 17-fold by the presence of negatively supercoiled DNA and approximately 4 molecules of ATP were hydrolyzed/supercoil removed. Finally, a kinetic model describing the switch from a processive to a distributive relaxation reaction is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1969184431,"Vegetative cells of Clostridium botulinum were shown to contain iron-sulfur proteins that react with added nitrite to form iron-nitric oxide complexes, with resultant destruction of the iron-sulfur cluster. Inactivation of iron-sulfur enzymes (especially ferredoxin) by binding of nitric oxide would almost certainly inhibit growth, and thus is probably the mechanism of botulinal inhibition by nitrite in foods."
https://openalex.org/W2015667893,"The Lewy body, a histological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, is a filamentous inclusion residing most prominently in pigmented neurons of the brainstem. Immunocytochemical reactions of Lewy bodies were examined with antisera to several filamentous proteins of the nervous system and positive reactions were found with those against neurofilaments. An abnormal organization of the neuronal cytoskeleton may be a pathological feature of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2086650594,"We have used P-element-mediated transformation to introduce a cloned Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene into the germ line of ADH null flies. Six independent transformants expressing ADH were identified by their acquired resistance to ethanol. Each transformant carries a single copy of the cloned Adh gene in a different chromosomal location. Four of the six transformant lines exhibit normal Adh expression by the following criteria: quantitative levels of ADH enzyme activity in larvae and adults; qualitative tissue specificity; the size of stable Adh mRNA; and the characteristic developmental switch in utilization of two different Adh promoters. The remaining two transformants express ADH enzyme activity with the correct tissue specificity, but at a lower level than wild type. These results demonstrate that an 11.8 kb chromosomal fragment containing the Adh gene includes the cis-acting sequences necessary for its correct developmental expression, and that a variety of chromosomal sites permit proper Adh gene function."
https://openalex.org/W1552423677,"Rat heart contains a membrane-bound phosphodiesterase of the phospholipase D type which catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-acyl)ethanolamine to N-acylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid. The enzyme also hydrolyzes the corresponding alkenylacylglycerophospho(N-acyl)ethanolamine and N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids but not phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. The activity is highest in the microsomal fraction, does not require Ca2+ or Mg2+, and is stimulated by Triton X-100. Bile salts, other ionic detergents, and Zn2+ are inhibitory. Hydrolysis occurs over a wide pH range, with the activity at acid pH being stimulated by freezing and thawing. Other rat tissues also release N-acylethanolamine from N-acylethanolamine phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2005467854,"The Drosophila Sgs-4 gene directs the developmentally regulated production of a glue protein in the salivary glands of mature larvae. Previous work suggests that Sgs-4 expression requires a remote upstream region that becomes hypersensitive to DNAase I digestion when the gene is active. Here we describe a variant Sgs-4 locus that has a 1.3 kb DNA insert separating the gene from the remote hypersensitive region. This insert defines a new family of transposable elements that we call hobo. Expression from the variant locus is reduced 50 to 100 fold, and rather than the one, normal Sgs-4 transcript, there are now four transcripts, two starting within the hobo element. These multiple transcripts are still expressed only in late larval salivary glands, implying that developmental regulation is unaffected by changes in the site of transcript initiation. When Sgs-4 is active, the remote DNAase I-hypersensitive region, now even more remote due to the insert, still forms over its normal sequences. In contrast, new hypersensitive sites form within hobo near the starts of the new transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W1760982454,"Plasma membrane (PM) can be isolated by binding to a positively charged solid support. Using this concept, we have developed a novel method of PM isolation using cationic colloidal silica. The method is designed for the comparative study of various physiological states of PM and for transbilayer protein mapping. The procedure consists of coating intact cells with a dense pellicle of silica particles and polyanion. Since cells remain intact during pellicle formation, the external face of the PM is selectively coated. The pellicle greatly enhances PM density and stabilizes it against vesiculation or lateral reorientation. Upon cell lysis, large open sheets of PM are rapidly isolated by centrifugation. PM from Dictyostelium discoideum was prepared by this method. Marker enzymes, cell surface labeling and microscopy demonstrate that the PM was isolated in high yield (70-80%) with a 10-17-fold purification and only low levels of cytoplasmic contamination. The pellicle remains intact during cell lysis and membrane isolation, shielding the external surface of the membranes up to 92% from chemical or enzymatic attack. The PM can thus be labeled selectively from inside and/or outside. Transmembrane proteins were identified in Dictyostelium PM by means of lactoperoxidase iodination and autoradiography."

https://openalex.org/W1519530959,"A type II DNA topoisomerase has been purified from the nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster 6- to 18-h-old embryos. The enzyme, as assayed by its ability to catenate supercoiled DNA, behaved as a single homogeneous species throughout the procedure and the yield was approximately 0.5 mg of protein/100 g of dechorionated embryos. The final product was entirely ATP-dependent and free of topoisomerase I, endonuclease and protease activities. The purified topoisomerase II had a Stokes radius of 69 A and a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 9.2 S, leading to a calculated native molecular weight of approximately 261,000. The protein consists of a single polypeptide of molecular weight 166,000, as determined by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Taken together with the above hydrodynamic studies, the Drosophila enzyme is probably a homodimer, as has been observed for other eukaryotic type II enzymes. Thus, it appears that during the course of evolution the heterologous subunits which comprise bacterial type II topoisomerases have been combined into a single polypeptide chain in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2095081971,"The genome structure of a newly isolated avian erythroblastosis virus, AEV-H, was analyzed. Using DNA probes specific for the LTR sequence of SR-RSV-A, and for the erbA gene and the erbB gene of the ES4 strain of AEV, we have shown that the genome of AEV-H is 35S in size and carries the erbB gene but not the erbA gene. Comparison of the restriction sites of molecularly cloned AEV-H DNA with that of cloned DNA of the associated virus revealed that the env gene of the associated virus was replaced with the erbB gene to generate AEV-H. The genome structure of AEV-H is, therefore, determined to be 5′-gag-pol-erbB-3′. Moreover, we have isolated a mutant of AEV-H, td-130, that can induce sarcomas but not erythroblastosis in chickens. The restriction analysis of proviral DNA of the td-130 showed that it carries a deletion of about 150 to 200 nucleotides in the erbB gene. These data indicate that the erbB protein is responsible for both erythroblastosis and sarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W1534356616,"The receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on human foreskin fibroblasts has been characterized. The molecular weight of the PDGF-receptor complex was estimated by affinity labeling techniques to about 200,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis performed under reducing conditions. Subtraction of the Mr of reduced PDGF (18,000 to 15,000) gives a Mr for the receptor proper of 185,000 (+/- 10,000). The mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis was similar whether or not reducing agents were present, suggesting that the receptor may be a single chain protein. The hydrodynamic size of the 125I-PDGF-receptor complex after solubilization with Triton X-100, corresponded to a Mr of approximately 320,000, as determined by gel chromatography. Subtraction of the Mr contributions from Triton X-100 and PDGF, respectively, gives a Mr of approximately 200,000 for the receptor itself, an estimate in good agreement with the value obtained from the affinity-labeling experiments. Several lectins were analyzed for their ability to inhibit binding of 125I-PDGF to its receptor. It was found that wheat germ agglutinin and a lectin from Crotalaria juncea were effective inhibitors and that their inhibitory effects could be neutralized by N-acetylglucosamine and galactose, respectively, suggesting that the receptor contains these sugars. The properties of the receptor were compared with those of a 185,000-Da component, being the major substrate for the membrane-bound PDGF-stimulated kinase. It was found that the 185,000-Da component behaved similar to the PDGF receptor in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, performed with or without reducing agents present. Further, the 185,000-Da component co-eluted with the PDGF receptor on a Sepharose 6B column, and had affinity for the same lectins that inhibited the binding of 125I-PDGF to its receptor. Finally, the 185,000-Da component had affinity for PDGF immobilized on Sepharose beads, suggesting that it has PDGF-binding activity. We conclude that the PDGF receptor and the 185,000-Da substrate for the PDGF-dependent kinase are intimately related and probably identical molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1527205553,"Procollagenase and a latent activator of procollagenase were found in culture medium from rabbit synovial fibroblasts stimulated either with crystals of monosodium urate monohydrate or with phorbol myristate acetate. Procollagenase (pI 6.8) and activator (pI 5.48) could be separated by isoelectric focusing. Both procollagenase and the latent activator were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by immunoadsorption chromatography. The activator was found to exist as a doublet of Mr = 53,400 and 51,900, with conversion to a lower Mr form upon treatment with either trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. In the absence of activator, purified procollagenase was not activated either by trypsin or by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, although both agents were capable of converting procollagenase to a lower Mr form. Activation of crude procollagenase was inhibited by immunoprecipitation of latent activator prior to addition of trypsin. Procollagenase activation increased with increased concentration of activator and with increased time of incubation with activator. The activator itself had no collagenolytic activity. The activation did not result in an apparent decrease in Mr of the procollagenase molecule as seen on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Both high and low Mr procollagenase (trypsin-treated) could be activated by the activator. Purified activator, but not purified procollagenase, contained latent proteolytic activity against azocasein, gelatin, and reduced carboxymethylated bovine serum albumin substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1988664219,"Oral administration of 13-cis-retinoic acid (40 or 160 milligrams per kilogram of body weight daily) significantly reduced the inflammation associated with developing and established adjuvant arthritis, an experimentally induced arthritis in rats that resembles human rheumatoid arthritis. The amount of collagenase secreted in tissue culture by adherent cells isolated from the inflamed joints of adjuvant rats treated with 13-cis-retinoic acid also decreased as compared to the amount secreted by cells from vehicle-treated adjuvant rats. Collagenase is important in the joint destruction accompanying rheumatoid arthritis. The successful use of retinoids in the treatment of this proliferative but nonmalignant disorder demonstrates a new application of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2065446700,"The DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV) can integrate into the genomes of infected human liver cells and may be related to the development of primary liver carcinoma (PLC). This report describes the analysis of three integrated HBV DNA sequences cloned from DNA of the human PLC cell line PLC/PRF/5. In all these sequences, integration of the viral DNA is at a site that is single-stranded (gap) in the unintegrated HBV DNA. Contrary to some speculations, there are no large terminal redundancies flanking the inserts as found in retroviral proviruses. The viral sequences show no obvious rearrangements in these clones, but integration can be associated with deletions in the viral DNA and also apparently in the host DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1595868791,"Transcription of the lambda rightward operon encounters multiple tandem p-dependent termination sites at a region known as tR1, yielding the mRNA for the lytic repressor cro. We show that in the absence of p factor, RNA polymerase pauses at each of three p-dependent termination sites (I, II, and III) at tR1 during in vitro transcription. We demonstrate that p factor itself does not affect transcriptional pausing at these sites. Relative occupancies of the pause sites during initial transcription have been measured. The lambda cin-1cnc-1 mutations, which abolish or vastly reduce termination at site II of tR1, nevertheless elicit transcriptional pausing at that site. The NusA protein (L factor) prolongs these transcriptional pauses to varying degrees. Transcriptional pausing at termination site II is dramatically enhanced by NusA in lambda wild type, but not in lambda cin-1cnc-1. NusA enhances pausing at site I but inhibits termination at that site, suggesting that it may also affect transcript release. We show that NusA does alter the kinetics of transcript release from isolated ternary complexes. We suggest that the ability of the NusA protein to increase or decrease termination efficiencies at various sites is attributed to its ability to modulate transcriptional pausing as well as transcript release."
https://openalex.org/W2099298539,"We report the isolation of a mutation, boxA1, in the nutR region of the phage lambda genome. The nutR region, located downstream of the pR promoter, includes the site nutR where the lambda N protein is thought to act to render subsequent transcription termination-resistant. We have previously suggested that the boxA sequence, 5'CGCTCTTA3' (or its RNA analog), located 8 bp promoter-proximal to nutR, might be the recognition site for the E. coli host factor, NusA, which has been shown to be necessary for N action. The boxA1 mutation, an A:T to T:A transversion, results in a changed boxA sequence upstream of nutR, CGCTCTTT. This change is necessary for lambda to effectively use the NusA of Salmonella typhimurium, a NusA function not normally active with the N product of lambda. Other lambdoid phages with unique N functions and nut sites that are normally active with the NusA of Salmonella have boxA sequences with the terminal three Ts. Moreover, sequences closely resembling boxA have been found near transcription termination sequences in E. coli operons where NusA has been shown to be involved in termination. These findings identify boxA as an important recognition signal for the NusA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1968737837,"Extracts from adult human adrenals contained high concentrations of immunoreactive beta-endorphin and alpha-melanotropin. Lower quantities of immunoreactive adrenocorticotropic hormone could also be detected. Distribution studies showed the presence of pro-opiomelanocortin fragments in the adrenal medulla. No alpha-melanotropin, beta-endorphin, or adrenocorticotropic hormone could be found in adrenal extracts from several other mammalian species. Analysis of the beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity using region specific radioimmunoassays interfacing with gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography showed the majority of the beta-endorphin-like material to exist as nonacetylated beta-endorphin-(1-31) with a small percentage of lipotropin-sized molecules. The alpha-melanotropin-like immunoreactivity cochromatographed on gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with desacetyl alpha-melanotropin. The data suggest that pro-opiomelanocortin is expressed in the adrenal medulla of humans but is not detectable in the adrenal glands of many other mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W1562007586,"In the anterior pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is the protein precursor to both adrenocorticotropin and beta-lipotropin but in the intermediate pituitary POMC serves as the precursor to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin. In addition, POMC expression in the anterior pituitary is inhibited by glucocorticoids but stimulated by corticotropin-releasing factor while POMC expression in the intermediate lobe is not responsive to glucocorticoids but is inhibited by dopamine. In this study we have asked whether tissue-specific processing and regulation of POMC could be related to the presence of more than one POMC gene. We report here that the mouse genome contains two POMC related gene sequences, alpha- and beta-POMC, that alpha-POMC is located on mouse chromosome 12 while beta-POMC is on a different chromosome, probably chromosome 19. Sequencing of phage lambda recombinants containing alpha- and beta-POMC sequences indicated that the alpha-POMC gene in mouse is very similar to the single POMC gene found in human, bovine, and rat genomes. The sequence of the mouse beta-POMC gene is quite different from that of the alpha-POMC gene. One important difference is that the beta-POMC gene has a translation stop signal in place of the first amino acid in beta-endorphin (Tyr). The beta-POMC gene has many features in common with the pseudogene of the beta-globin family."
https://openalex.org/W1553051687,"The slow inward calcium channel, identified by physiologic and pharmacologic responses and [3H]nitrendipine-specific binding, has been characterized by radiation inactivation and covalent affinity labeling. Target size analysis of guinea pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle membranes indicates a molecular weight of 278,000 for the calcium channel. An affinity label analog of nifedipine and nitrendipine, 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-dicarbomethoxy-4-(2-isothiocyanatophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine, was found to inhibit the calcium channel by a covalent interaction with a protein subunit (Mr = 45,000) of the calcium channel."

https://openalex.org/W1579776952,"Nuclear envelopes were prepared from purified rat liver nuclei by lysis with heparin, digestion with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), or sonication. The envelopes were fractionated by centrifugation on sucrose density gradients and analyzed for protein kinase activity using endogenous and exogenous protein substrates and [gamma-32 P]ATP. The protein kinase activity toward endogenous proteins was markedly affected by the method used to isolate the envelopes, with sonication producing a preparation with very low activity. At least 12 phosphoproteins in nuclear envelopes isolated by the heparin or DNase I method were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A 32P-labeled material migrating with an apparent Mr = 3000 was extracted with chloroform:methanol:HCl and was identified as a mixture of phospholipids. Total 32P incorporation into nuclear envelopes peaked at 5 min of incubation, followed by a decrease in labeled products. This decrease was due to both phosphoprotein phosphatase activity and degradation of the lipid products. The highest protein kinase activity toward endogenous proteins was expressed with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of MgCl2; however, some phosphorylation also occurred with MnCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, and [gamma-32P]GTP in the presence of MgCl2. Nuclear envelope protein phosphorylation was unaffected by cyclic nucleotides and calmodulin, slightly inhibited by CaCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, disulfides, and sulfhydryl alkylating agents, and strongly inhibited by LaCl3 and phosphatidylglycerol. Nuclear porelamina complexes isolated from phosphorylated envelopes contained phosphoproteins of 7, 20, 51, 59, and 70 kDa. Incubation of pore-lamina complexes isolated from unlabeled envelopes with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in 32P incorporation into the 20-, 51-, and 50-kDa proteins."

The lysate-induced effects on electrolyte transport were similar to those caused by serotonin, and were blocked by bufotenine, an analog known to inhibit the action of serotonin. The transport effects were partially inhibited by antibody to serotonin. The amebic lysates were shown to contain serotonin by radioimmunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography, and thin-layer chromatography. These results suggest that the serotonin present in Entamoeba histolytica may be important in the diarrhea seen in amebiasis."
https://openalex.org/W1483337972,"The action of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to stimulate synthesis of steroid 21-hydroxylase was studied in bovine adrenocortical cells maintained in primary culture. Continuous treatment with ACTH (1 microM) caused an increased incorporation of [35S]methionine into cytochrome P-450C21 (21-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450); a maximum value (15-fold increase) was attained 24 h after initiation of ACTH treatment. Also, a 3-fold increase in cytochrome P-450C21 synthesis was observed in a cell-free translation system programmed by RNA isolated from cells that were exposed to ACTH for 24 h. The rate of synthesis of cytochrome P-450C21 declined after longer periods of treatment of the cells with ACTH. The increase in synthesis of cytochrome P-450C21 was associated with an increase (3-6 fold) in both total cytochrome P-450 content and in the type I absorbance change induced by 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone in microsomes prepared from ACTH-treated cells, as compared with that in microsomes from control cells. By contrast, ACTH did not act to increase steroid 21-hydroxylase activity in cultured intact cells, as determined by the rate of secretion of cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol, after addition of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to the medium. Similarly, there was no difference in steroid 21-hydroxylase activity in postmitochondrial supernatant fractions prepared from non-treated or ACTH-treated cells. Cytochrome P-450C21 was found to be synthesized as a form identical in molecular weight to the mature form. These results are indicative that ACTH acts to stimulate the synthesis of steroid 21-hydroxylase, yet is without a demonstrable effect on the activity of this enzyme which is high throughout the time period of the experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2027163118,"The gene for the Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) p21ras protein was fused to the amino-terminal portion of the bacteriophage lambda cII gene on the expression vector pJL6. The fusion was such that transcription was controlled by the well-regulated phage lambda pL promoter, and translation initiated in the cII gene continued in frame into the ras gene sequences that code for p21. When the pL promoter was derepressed, the Escherichia coli cells harboring the fusion plasmid synthesized 23,000-dalton protein, which represented more than 10 percent of the total cellular protein. This protein was chimeric and contained 14 residues, which were specified by the vector; these residues were followed by all of the amino acids that make up Ha-MuSV p21ras except for four residues at the amino-terminal end. The protein appears similar to Ha-MuSV p21ras in that it undergoes immunoprecipitation by monoclonal antibodies directed toward that protein, binds guanosine diphosphate, and is capable of autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2077070092,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulated the synthesis of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in fractions of isolated carp horizontal cells. When applied extracellularly to isolated and cultured horizontal cells, the peptide also induced a slow depolarization (30 to 40 millivolts) accompanied by a decrease in membrane resistance. However, analogs of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate applied extracellularly or intracellularly, and forscolin applied extracellularly, had no effect on the membrane potential of cultured horizontal cells, indicating that the induced depolarization was not related to the accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in these cells."

https://openalex.org/W1556263106,"Heterologous anti-human platelet membrane antisera were raised in rabbits against membranes prepared from human intact or chymotrypsin- or pronase-treated platelets. Anti-intact, anti-chymotrypsin, and anti-pronase-treated platelet membrane antibodies (IgG and Fab fragments) inhibited the fibrinogen-induced aggregation of ADP-stimulated platelets and of chymotrypsin-treated platelets. The specific binding of 125I-fibrinogen to these platelets was also inhibited. As revealed by the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-surface-radiolabeled platelet proteins and by the electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates prepared from these labeled proteins, predominant components on the surface of intact platelets were glycoproteins IIb and IIIa. These proteins were immunoprecipitated by all three antibodies. In addition, chymotrypsin-treated platelets contained an Mr = 66,000 protein on their surface that was also immunoprecipitated by the three types of anti-platelet membrane antibodies. The appearance of this Mr = 66,000 protein on the surface of chymotrypsin-treated platelets correlated with the exposure of fibrinogen receptors on the platelet surface as evidenced by the increased platelet aggregation and the enhanced 125I-fibrinogen binding shown by chymotrypsin-treated platelets. The origin of the Mr = 66,000 protein labeled on chymotrypsin-treated platelets was studied by first labeling intact platelets with 125I and then treating these platelets with chymotrypsin. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the total labeled proteins present after chymotrypsin treatment and those immunoprecipitated by anti-pronase-treated platelet membrane antibody from detergent extracts of chymotrypsin-treated platelets suggested that the Mr = 66,000 protein was a proteolytic cleavage product of glycoprotein IIIa. Analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels of the major chymotryptic cleavage products of partially purified glycoprotein IIIa and analysis of the peptide of glycoprotein IIIa immunoprecipitated by anti-pronase-treated platelet membrane antibody revealed that the Mr = 66,000 protein produced by chymotrypsin on the platelet surface was the major chymotryptic cleavage product of glycoprotein IIIa. We propose a hypothesis that the Mr = 66,000 is a part of glycoprotein IIIa present on the surface of proteolytically treated platelets and it may function in fibrinogen binding and fibrinogen-induced platelet aggregation and that the 66,000-dalton region of glycoprotein IIIa in intact platelets may represent the fibrinogen-binding domain of glycoprotein IIIa."

These changes in social behavior elicited by environmental manipulations were counteracted by treatment with the adrenocorticotropic hormone (4-9) analog ORG 2766. The peptide's normalizing effect may be mediated by endogenous opioid systems."
https://openalex.org/W1554731852,"A cDNA clone containing sequences complementary to the mRNA coding for rat hepatic 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase has been isolated and used to measure changes in specific mRNA levels during dietary and hormonal regulation of this enzyme. Hepatic mRNA was fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation to enrich for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase mRNA sequences. A cDNA library was prepared from the fraction with maximal activity and then screened by differential colony hybridization using probes synthesized either from 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase mRNA enriched by polysome immunoadsorption or from unenriched hepatic mRNA. A single colony giving an appropriate differential signal was confirmed to contain sequences encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase by specific immunoprecipitation of hybrid-selected translational products. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase mRNA contains about 2400 bases. The cloned cDNA comprises about 880 bases, or 35% of the mRNA. Southern analysis of restriction endonuclease digests of genomic DNA suggests that the major 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene is probably present in a single copy in the rat genome. Feeding a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet and administration of thyroid hormone increased the concentration of hybridizable 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase mRNA in liver. Thus, both dietary and hormonal regulation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase synthesis occurs at a pretranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W2075355572,The mouse homolog (c-sis) of the transforming gene of the simian sarcoma virus was mapped to chromosome 15 by the Southern blot analysis of DNA's from hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids. Alterations in c-sis expression may thus play a role in the various murine neoplastic diseases characterized by rearrangements or duplications of chromosome 15.
https://openalex.org/W2000677056,"We describe a repression mechanism in which read-through messages transcribed from a gene into an IS1 sequence inhibit its ability to mediate plasmid cointegration. This mechanism was derived from the demonstration that removal of the promoter region of the chloramphenicol resistance gene in transposon Tn9, or introduction of a strong transcription terminator of phage T7 downstream of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, increases the cointegration ability of the downstream IS1 sequence when in a particular orientation. The cointegration ability of an IS1 sequence downstream of the chloramphenicol resistance gene but in an orientation opposite that of the above-mentioned IS1 sequence also can be repressed. Analysis of transcripts synthesized in vitro showed that the transcripts of the chloramphenicol resistance gene were read through into the IS1 sequence located downstream of the gene in either orientation. Repression of this type may be one mechanism that controls the rate of transposition of the IS1 element, which apparently does not encode a structural gene for repressor."
https://openalex.org/W1977095083,"Transfer RNA (tRNA) suppression of nonsense mutations in prokaryotic systems has been widely used to study the structure and function of different prokaryotic genes. Through genetic engineering techniques, it is now possible to introduce suppressor (Su+) tRNA molecules into mammalian cells. A quantitative assay of the suppressor tRNA activity in these mammalian cells is described; it is based on the amount of tRNA-mediated readthrough of a terminating codon in the influenza virus NS1 gene after the cells are infected with virus. Suppressor activity in L cells continuously expressing Su+ (tRNAtyr) was 3.5 percent and that in CV-1 cells infected with an SV40- Su+ (tRNAtyr) recombinant was 22.5 percent."
