https://openalex.org/W1988643163,"A theory of the kinetics of death is presented which is based upon the experimentally determined Gompertz function and the postulates that the distribution of stress magnitudes is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and an organism dies when stress magnitude exceeds the organism's maximum ability to compensate therefor. The theory predicts a zero-order loss of function versus age. This is borne out in human males by independent observation. The theory permits several independent calculations of the value of B, the percent of loss per year of physiologic function. The calculated values range from 0.9 to 1.4 percent per year and agree closely with the observed rates in human males. The theory predicts an inverse linear relationship between Gompertz slope and ln R/ sub 0/ (intercept), which is closely confirmed by observation. The theory predicts that the mean ratio of maximum reserve capacity to average demand lies between 7 and 11. Independent physiologic measurement data are in reasonable agreement with these values. The theory predicts the observed effects of prolonged or instantaneous exposure of experimental animals to ionizing radiation. The relative deleteriousness (D) of various national environments can be calculated. They have been found to differ by approximately 50 percent. We have beenmore » unable to make an independent test of these relative values. Despite the fact that it is derived for a homogeneous population the theory is shown to be not inconsistent with individual variability within a population. (auth)« less"

https://openalex.org/W2032870527,"Reserpine, when administered to animals stressed by exposure to cold, does not induce sedation or appreciably lower brain serotonin, but markedly lowers brain norepinephrine. Reserpine in cold-exposed hypophysectomized rats elicits sedation and releases both amines equally. The results support the view that the tranquilizing action of reserpine is not related to brain norepinephrine loss but rather to change in the level of brain serotonin."

In cranial capacity, therefore, and probably in body-brain ratio as well, Oreopithecus is a hominoid."

https://openalex.org/W2021714931,"Gibberellins are a specific growth requirement of tissue cultures derived from the staminate cones of Cupressus funebris. The tissue originally required coconut milk for growth. However, a mixture of acid-hydrolyzed casein hydrolyzate and gibberellins replaces the coconut milk entirely and permits even better growth. It is tentatively suggested that coconut milk contains gibberellins or related substances and that these substances are involved in the nitrogen metabolism of the tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2059720011,"IT has been reported by Sullivan1 that anaemia developed in immature rats fed on a diet containing those metallic complexes of edetic acid having stability constants lower than ferrous iron, the anaemia being preventable by simultaneous iron injections. Other authors2–4 had reported that these complexes given to adult rats orally or by injection produced no alteration of the blood picture compared with controls. It seemed probable therefore that the chelates were capable of producing an iron deficiency anaemia in immature rats but less readily or not at all in adult animals, and this problem has been further investigated."

In contrast, adrenal insufficiency produces the opposite effects2. Similarly, deoxycorticosterone acetate is known to be a relatively potent anæsthetic steroid6."
