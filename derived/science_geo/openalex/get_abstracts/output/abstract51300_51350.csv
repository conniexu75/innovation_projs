https://openalex.org/W2089093309,"Heavy and light polypeptide chains isolated from different specific antibodies to haptens and from (gamma)G-immunoglobulin of normal rabbits have been resolved into distinct, multiple components by disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of urea. In spite of the resolution of these chains into multiple bands, different specific antibodies and normal rabbit (gamma)G-immunoglobulin were indistinguishable from each other by this method."

Methylenedioxyphenyl compounds apparently serve as alternate substrates for this enzymatic hydroxylation system of microsomes, and thus reduce the rate of metabolism and prolong the action of certain drugs and insecticide chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W1996510784,"Antiserum from goats immunized with heavy polypeptide chains from a gammaA-type myeloma globulin was absorbed with serum from patients with selective absence of immunoglobulin A (gammaA). The resulting reagents could be used for the classification of 58 gammaA-myeloma proteins into two distinct antigenic types, respectively called subclasses He and Le. These differences were shown to be related to the heavy (alpha) polypeptide chains and independent of the integrity of interchain disulfide bridges. The gammaA-immunoglobulin from normal serum appears to consist, for the most part, of molecules with Le subclass specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1549520402,"Abstract Antithyroid agents of the thiourea type (thiourea, thiouracil, and 5-vinyl-2-oxazolidinethione) inhibit the enzymatic halogenation reactions catalyzed by chloroperoxidase. These compounds are competitive with the halogen acceptor molecule and serve as substrates for chloroperoxidase. These antithyroid agents are oxidized by chloroperoxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a suitable halogen anion (chloride, bromide, or iodide). The first isolable oxidation product of thiourea and thiouracil is the corresponding disulfide. It is proposed that a sulfenyl halide is a precursor of the disulfide. Spectral evidence indicates the formation of an intermediate in the oxidation of 5-vinyl-2-oxazolidinethione. This intermediate is postulated to be a disulfide by analogy to the thiourea and thiouracil oxidations. The goitrogen 1,1,3-tricyano-2-amino-1-propene serves as a halogen acceptor in the chloroperoxidase reaction. Chloroperoxidase catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide-dependent oxidation of thiocyanate. Thiocyanate oxidation does not require the presence of a halogen anion. Cyanide ion is one of the oxidation products. Thiocyanate ion inhibits the enzymatic halogenation reactions catalyzed by chloroperoxidase in a manner which is noncompetitive with respect to other chloroperoxidase substrates. It is proposed that antithyroid agents containing the thiourylene group or related structures inhibit enzymatic halogenation reactions by virtue of being extremely active nucleophiles and thus capable of reacting with an enzyme-bound halogenium ion."

https://openalex.org/W1963747842,Determination of the residual gamma isomer of benzene hexachloride (gamma-BHC) by gas chromatography showed that the insecticide persisted longer in sterilized flooded soils than in nonsterilized flooded soils. A second addition of gamma-BHC to one of the nonsterilized soils. (55 days after the first application) disappepsilonared more rapidly than the first addition. These results strongly indicate biodegradation of gamma-BHC in flooded soils.
https://openalex.org/W2007485252,"There is a positive correlation between the concentration of immunoglobulin-G in plaques of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis (as well as in white matter of normal appearance) and the concentration of this globulin in the cerebrospinal fluid. The tentative conclusion drawn from these results was that, in patients with multiple sclerosis, the increase in immuno-globulin-G in the cerebrospinal fluid is a reflection of an excess of this globulin in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1586757195,"Abstract Rabbit immunoglobulin G, enriched with more than 800 dl-alanine residues per molecule, still reacts with goat antibodies to immunoglobulin G. It is completely soluble in neutral aqueous buffers after total reduction (46 sulfhydryl groups per molecule) and unfolding of the molecule in 8 m guanidine hydrochloride. Following complete reduction, essentially all of the antigenic activity is lost. The recovery of antigenic activity during reoxidation is essentially independent of the protein concentration (30 to 1000 µg per ml). It is more complete at 4° than at room temperature, and, because of solubility characteristics, proceeds best with heavily alanylated preparations. Under optimal conditions of reoxidation, essentially all of the antigenic determinants can be recovered as demonstrated by precipitation with goat antibodies to immunoglobulin G, although 2.5 to 4 times more reoxidized material is required for complete precipitation of the antibodies than the corresponding untreated material. From results of experiments on reoxidation of separated chains, it seems that intrachain disulfide bonds are re-formed before the interchain disulfide bonds. The main conclusion of this paper is that it confirms the hypothesis that no genetic information other than that present in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chains is required for the correct conformation of a protein molecule as complex as immunoglobulin G."
https://openalex.org/W2081181520,"A genetic antigen, Gm(n), has been described for the Ne subgroup of gamma-globulin previously devoid of Gm factors. It was detected by precipitin tests with a primate antiserum to Ne-type heavy chains. A relation to the Gm(b) antigens of the Vi subgroup and the Gm(f) and Gm(y) antigens of the We subgroup was apparent. The availability of genetic antigens for the heavy chains of three subgroups of gamma-globulin with varying relationships in different populations offers an approach to the mapping of the genes concerned."
https://openalex.org/W1999487861,Synthesis of plasma alpha(2) (acute phase)-globulin was demonstrated in isolated perfused rat liver obtained from animals showing acute inflammatory reaction to injury. These findings indicate that the liver is a source of the globulin and that appearance of this protein in the serum results from de novo synthesis by the liver rather than from release of performed and stored globulin.
https://openalex.org/W1489773305,"Abstract Treatment of rabbit immunoglobulin G with cyanogen bromide in 0.3 M HCl under specified conditions resulted in the cleavage of about half of its methionyl peptide bonds. A 5 S fragment was isolated from the reaction mixture by gel filtration in a quantitative yield. A comparison of the molecular weight and the amino acid composition of this fragment with the pepsin-produced 5 S fragment indicates that the latter is somewhat bigger than the CNBr 5 S fragment. The CNBr 5 S fragment reacted fully with goat antiserum against papain digest Fragment I of rabbit immunoglobulin G, but, in contrast to native immunoglobulin G, did not react with goat antiserum against papain digest Fragment III. The CNBr 5 S fragment of rabbit antibody to bovine serum albumin retained the full capacity to precipitate the antigen, but did not respond in the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test; the ability to fix complement was very markedly reduced. Reduction of the CNBr 5 S fragment of the antibody with cysteine or 2-mercaptoethylamine led to the formation of a 3.3 S fragment, capable of reacting with bovine serum albumin but not of precipitating it. Reoxidation of the CNBr 3.3 S fragment resulted in a partial reformation of the 5 S fragment."

Some of the common antigenic determinants revealed by these cross-reactions depend on the tertiary and quaternary structure of the IgG and IgM molecules and are independent of their K and L light-chain antigenic types.

https://openalex.org/W1605909481,"Abstract Descriptions of some thermodynamic properties and transport behavior in solution of an intact multiple myeloma γG-globulin and of one of the products of its reaction with mercaptoethylamine have been provided. For the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, the parent γG-globulin was dissolved in three solvent systems: cacodylate buffer, its 8 m urea solution and its 6 m guanidine hydrochloride solution, all at pH 7. Molecular weight and second virial coefficient data were also obtained for the mercaptoethylamine reaction product in 6 m urea solvent. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with the same solutions. The concentration dependence, both of apparent molecular weight and of sedimentation coefficient, for the parent molecule in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride is quite normal. The same may be said of the corresponding behavior of the submolecule in 6 m urea buffer solution. On the other hand, suitable interpretations of sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation transport data for the solutions of the γG-globulin in cacodylate and 8 m urea buffers seem to require the use of an association mechanism. A simplified theory, based on the assumption that only dimerization occurs in solution, is presented which makes use of a combination of the two kinds of information. In this way, it has become possible to provide a value for the dimerization constant and to assign limiting sedimentation coefficients for monomer and dimer. For the reasons given, the dimerization is believed to take place in an end-to-end fashion."

https://openalex.org/W2084725758,"Rabbit antiserums, originally prepared to react specifically with rabbit immunoglobulin allotypes Ab5 and Ab6, also react with some normal rabbit serums that clearly do not contain Ab5 or Ab6 allotypes. This reaction is due to antigenic specificity present on rabbit immunoglobulin M(IgM) and not on rabbit immunoglobulin G. Serums that contain this IgM allotype do not react with an antiserum that reacts with the known rabbit IgM allotype, Ms1. This specificity may therefore be identified as a second rabbit IgM allotype, Ms2."

https://openalex.org/W2061927831,"IT is generally held that the absorption of whole proteins by piglets occurs only during the first two days of life. By this mechanism the baby pig acquires antibodies. For the first 5 days post partum the sow's colostrum contains a trypsin inhibitor1 and it has been suggested2 that the function of the trypsin inhibitor is to prevent the digestion of γ-globulins, so allowing the piglet to absorb them intact. Extending this theory further, it can be postulated that whole protein absorption ceases when there is insufficient inhibitor in the colostrum to inactivate all the trypsin entering the gut."
https://openalex.org/W2037987545,"DURING the past few years our knowledge of the immunoglobulins of man and mammals has been substantially extended. The method of making antiglobulin sera developed by Milgrom et al. in 1956 (ref. 1) has played a decisive part in this particular connexion. As is well known, this method makes it possible to prepare antisera which react, in addition to γ-globulins (IgG, IgA, IgM), with complemental factors, if any2. Since our knowledge of non-mammalian immunoglobulins is limited3–10, I prepared (using a modification of Milgrom's method2) antisera to the globulins of mammals (horse, cattle, hog), birds (duck, goose), turtles (Testudo hermanni Gmelin), and fishes (Cyprinus carpio L., Tinca tinca (L.), Perca fluviatilis L., and Ictalurus nebulosus Le Sueur). The serum concentration used to bring about coupling with erythrocytes was chosen so that, for the mammals, only antibodies were detectable against the γ-globulins during immunoelectrophoresis. In this connexion, distinct precipitate lines of the IgG and IgM globulins were always observed. Moreover, for both horse and hog a weak line was observed corresponding to the IgA globulin. The antisera prepared against the globulins of goose and duck showed wide identity during immunoelectrophoresis. Two parallel lines were found that could be assigned to the IgG and IgM globulins (Fig. 1A). Clearly visible is a splitting up of the IgG line in the anodic region."

In both instances there is an evident rise in the albumin-plus alpha(1) titer and an evident decrease in the gamma globulin levels. These findings suggest that the injection of alpha globulins has the same serum effect on the animal as parabiotically induced blood chimerism, namely, a reduction in circulating gamma globulin (immunoglobulins?)."

The same bands are present for chains from antibodies of the same or diverse specificities. Individual bands are of different intensities for chains from the different rabbits tested even if the antibodies are directed against the same hapten. The bands appear to represent classes of heterogeneous H-chains of the same size having discrete differences in mizobilities with respect to a single charge difference.

https://openalex.org/W1571932727,"Abstract The results of certain further characterizations of some immunoglobulin fragments, in this instance Pieces I (or II) and III, of a multiple myeloma γG-globulin (HL) are presented here. The submolecules have been separated from the papain-cysteine-protein system by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column which had been equilibrated with cacodylate buffer. For the physicochemical observations, two solvent media were used: aqueous cacodylate buffer and 8 m urea-cacodylate buffer, both at pH 7 and an ionic strength of approximately 0.1. Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with the protein systems. It was found that the two fragments have substantially the same molecular weight (50,000). In each case, the sedimentation equilibrium data (apparent weight average molecular weight plotted against the average concentration) suggest that the protein submolecules associate in cacodylate buffer. Values of the equilibrium constant for the process have been computed on the assumption that only dimerization occurs. Association was suppressed in the solvent system containing 8 m urea, and conventional sedimentation behavior was observed. The course of sedimentation velocity experiments has been explained on the same basis, namely, association in the cacodylate buffer system. It has been shown that it is possible to estimate limiting sedimentation coefficients (s25,w0) for both monomer and dimer which are consistent with the observed sedimentation equilibrium result. An attempt has been made to obtain a distribution of sedimentation coefficients for Pieces I (or II) and III, but it is recognized that there are difficulties involved."
