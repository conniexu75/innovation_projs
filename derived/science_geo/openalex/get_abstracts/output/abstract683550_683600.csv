https://openalex.org/W3206717788,"Extension of the interval between vaccine doses for the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was introduced in the United Kingdom to accelerate population coverage with a single dose. At this time, trial data were lacking, and we addressed this in a study of United Kingdom healthcare workers. The first vaccine dose induced protection from infection from the circulating alpha (B.1.1.7) variant over several weeks. In a substudy of 589 individuals, we show that this single dose induces severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses and a sustained B and T cell response to the spike protein. NAb levels were higher after the extended dosing interval (6–14 weeks) compared with the conventional 3- to 4-week regimen, accompanied by enrichment of CD4+ T cells expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2). Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection amplified and accelerated the response. These data on dynamic cellular and humoral responses indicate that extension of the dosing interval is an effective immunogenic protocol."
https://openalex.org/W3174904045,"Stress granules are dynamic, reversible condensates composed of RNA and protein that assemble in eukaryotic cells in response to a variety of stressors and are normally disassembled after stress is removed. The composition and assembly of stress granules is well understood, but little is known about the mechanisms that govern disassembly. Impaired disassembly has been implicated in some diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy. Using cultured human cells, we found that stress granule disassembly was context-dependent: Specifically in the setting of heat shock, disassembly required ubiquitination of G3BP1, the central protein within the stress granule RNA-protein network. We found that ubiquitinated G3BP1 interacted with the endoplasmic reticulum–associated protein FAF2, which engaged the ubiquitin-dependent segregase p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein). Thus, targeting of G3BP1 weakened the stress granule–specific interaction network, resulting in granule disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W3210382439,"Compared with linear mixed model-based genome-wide association (GWA) methods, generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)-based methods have better statistical properties when applied to binary traits but are computationally much slower. In the present study, leveraging efficient sparse matrix-based algorithms, we developed a GLMM-based GWA tool, fastGWA-GLMM, that is severalfold to orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art tools when applied to the UK Biobank (UKB) data and scalable to cohorts with millions of individuals. We show by simulation that the fastGWA-GLMM test statistics of both common and rare variants are well calibrated under the null, even for traits with extreme case–control ratios. We applied fastGWA-GLMM to the UKB data of 456,348 individuals, 11,842,647 variants and 2,989 binary traits (full summary statistics available at http://fastgwa.info/ukbimpbin ), and identified 259 rare variants associated with 75 traits, demonstrating the use of imputed genotype data in a large cohort to discover rare variants for binary complex traits. FastGWA-GLMM is a fast, scalable generalized linear mixed model method for genetic association testing for binary traits in large cohorts that is robust to variant frequency and case–control imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W3210769714,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Genome-wide association studies identified the 3p21.31 region as conferring a twofold increased risk of respiratory failure. Here, using a combined multiomics and machine learning approach, we identify the gain-of-function risk A allele of an SNP, rs17713054G>A, as a probable causative variant. We show with chromosome conformation capture and gene-expression analysis that the rs17713054-affected enhancer upregulates the interacting gene, leucine zipper transcription factor like 1 (LZTFL1). Selective spatial transcriptomic analysis of lung biopsies from patients with COVID-19 shows the presence of signals associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a viral response pathway that is regulated by LZTFL1. We conclude that pulmonary epithelial cells undergoing EMT, rather than immune cells, are likely responsible for the 3p21.31-associated risk. Since the 3p21.31 effect is conferred by a gain-of-function, LZTFL1 may represent a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3176820067,"Eukaryotic cells respond to stress through adaptive programs that include reversible shutdown of key cellular processes, the formation of stress granules, and a global increase in ubiquitination. The primary function of this ubiquitination is thought to be for tagging damaged or misfolded proteins for degradation. Here, working in mammalian cultured cells, we found that different stresses elicited distinct ubiquitination patterns. For heat stress, ubiquitination targeted specific proteins associated with cellular activities that are down-regulated during stress, including nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation, as well as stress granule constituents. Ubiquitination was not required for the shutdown of these processes or for stress granule formation but was essential for the resumption of cellular activities and for stress granule disassembly. Thus, stress-induced ubiquitination primes the cell for recovery after heat stress."

https://openalex.org/W3208495306,"Biofilms are community architectures adopted by bacteria inclusive of a self-formed extracellular matrix that protects resident bacteria from diverse environmental stresses and, in many species, incorporates extracellular DNA (eDNA) and DNABII proteins for structural integrity throughout biofilm development. Here, we present evidence that this eDNA-based architecture relies on the rare Z-form. Z-form DNA accumulates as biofilms mature and, through stabilization by the DNABII proteins, confers structural integrity to the biofilm matrix. Indeed, substances known to drive B-DNA into Z-DNA promoted biofilm formation whereas those that drive Z-DNA into B-DNA disrupted extant biofilms. Importantly, we demonstrated that the universal bacterial DNABII family of proteins stabilizes both bacterial- and host-eDNA in the Z-form in situ. A model is proposed that incorporates the role of Z-DNA in biofilm pathogenesis, innate immune response, and immune evasion."
https://openalex.org/W3211241105,"Blockade of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 pathway has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC). We report the interim results of DAWNA-1 ( NCT03927456 ), a double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trial of dalpiciclib (a new cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor) plus fulvestrant in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative ABC with disease progression after endocrine therapy. A total of 361 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. The study met the primary end point, showing significantly prolonged investigator-assessed progression-free survival with dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant (median = 15.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.1–not reached versus 7.2, 95% CI = 5.6–9.2 months; hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.31–0.58; one-sided P < 0.0001 (boundary was P ≤ 0.008)). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events with dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (84.2%) and leukopenia (62.1%). The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.8% with dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant versus 6.7% with placebo plus fulvestrant. Our findings support dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant as a new treatment option for pretreated hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative ABC. In the multicenter, phase 3 DAWNA-1 trial, the combination of dalpiciclib, a new cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor, with fulvestrant, in patients with HR+HER2− advanced breast cancer who progressed or relapsed on endocrine therapy, improved progression-free survival with manageable safety and may represent a new treatment option."

https://openalex.org/W3208823525,"The developmental role of histone H3K9 methylation (H3K9me), which typifies heterochromatin, remains unclear. In Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of H3K9me leads to a highly divergent upregulation of genes with tissue and developmental-stage specificity. During development H3K9me is lost from differentiated cell type-specific genes and gained at genes expressed in earlier developmental stages or other tissues. The continuous deposition of H3K9me2 by the SETDB1 homolog MET-2 after terminal differentiation is necessary to maintain repression. In differentiated tissues, H3K9me ensures silencing by restricting the activity of a defined set of transcription factors at promoters and enhancers. Increased chromatin accessibility following the loss of H3K9me is neither sufficient nor necessary to drive transcription. Increased ATAC-seq signal and gene expression correlate at a subset of loci positioned away from the nuclear envelope, while derepressed genes at the nuclear periphery remain poorly accessible despite being transcribed. In conclusion, H3K9me deposition can confer tissue-specific gene expression and maintain the integrity of terminally differentiated muscle by restricting transcription factor activity."
https://openalex.org/W3209926184,"Genetic alterations under positive selection in healthy tissues have implications for cancer risk. However, total levels of positive selection across the genome remain unknown. Passenger mutations are influenced by all driver mutations, regardless of type or location in the genome. Therefore, the total number of passengers can be used to estimate the total number of drivers—including unidentified drivers outside of cancer genes that are traditionally missed. Here we analyze the variant allele frequency spectrum of synonymous mutations from healthy blood and esophagus to quantify levels of missing positive selection. In blood, we find that only 30% of passengers can be explained by single-nucleotide variants in driver genes, suggesting high levels of positive selection for mutations elsewhere in the genome. In contrast, more than half of all passengers in the esophagus can be explained by just the two driver genes NOTCH1 and TP53, suggesting little positive selection elsewhere. Synonymous passenger mutations are used to measure levels of positive selection in healthy blood and esophagus. This approach can quantify missing selection due to unidentified drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3209822687,"How cancer cells adapt to evade the therapeutic effects of drugs targeting oncogenic drivers is poorly understood. Here we report an epigenetic mechanism leading to the adaptive resistance of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors. Prolonged FGFR inhibition suppresses the function of BRG1-dependent chromatin remodelling, leading to an epigenetic state that derepresses YAP-associated enhancers. These chromatin changes induce the expression of several amino acid transporters, resulting in increased intracellular levels of specific amino acids that reactivate mTORC1. Consistent with this mechanism, addition of mTORC1 or YAP inhibitors to FGFR blockade synergistically attenuated the growth of TNBC patient-derived xenograft models. Collectively, these findings reveal a feedback loop involving an epigenetic state transition and metabolic reprogramming that leads to adaptive therapeutic resistance and provides potential therapeutic strategies to overcome this mechanism of resistance. Li et al. define an adaptive resistance mechanism against FGFR inhibitor treatment in breast cancer attributed to loss of BRG1 chromatin recruitment, reactivation of YAP-dependent enhancers and upregulation of amino acid-induced mTORC1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W3210662747,"Background Plasma circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) is an immunogenic molecule and a novel biomarker of psychiatric disorders. Some previous studies reported increased levels of ccf-mtDNA in unmedicated depression and recent suicide attempters, while other studies found unchanged or decreased ccf-mtDNA levels in depression. Inconsistent findings across studies may be explained by small sample sizes and between-study variations in somatic and psychiatric co-morbidity or medication status. Methods We measured plasma ccf-mtDNA in a cohort of 281 patients with depressive disorders and 49 healthy controls. Ninety-three percent of all patients were treated with one or several psychotropic medications. Thirty-six percent had a personality disorder, 13% bipolar disorder. All analyses involving ccf-mtDNA were a priori adjusted for age and sex. Results Mean levels in ccf-mtDNA were significantly different between patients with a current depressive episode (n = 236), remitted depressive episode (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 49) (f = 8.3, p&lt;0.001). Post-hoc tests revealed that both patients with current (p&lt;0.001) and remitted (p = 0.002) depression had lower ccf-mtDNA compared to controls. Within the depressed group there was a positive correlation between ccf-mtDNA and “inflammatory depression symptoms” (r = 0.15, p = 0.02). We also found that treatment with mood stabilizers lamotrigine, valproic acid or lithium was associated with lower ccf-mtDNA (f = 8.1, p = 0.005). Discussion Decreased plasma ccf-mtDNA in difficult-to-treat depression may be partly explained by concurrent psychotropic medications and co-morbidity. Our findings suggest that ccf-mtDNA may be differentially regulated in different subtypes of depression, and this hypothesis should be pursued in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3209854618,"Many models of motor control emphasize the role of sensorimotor cortex in movement, principally through the projections that corticospinal neurons (CSNs) make to the spinal cord. Additionally, CSNs possess expansive supraspinal axon collaterals, the functional organization of which is largely unknown. Using anatomical and electrophysiological circuit-mapping techniques in the mouse, we reveal dorsolateral striatum as the preeminent target of CSN collateral innervation. We found that this innervation is biased so that CSNs targeting different striatal pathways show biased targeting of spinal cord circuits. Contrary to more conventional perspectives, CSNs encode not only individual movements, but also information related to the onset and offset of motor sequences. Furthermore, similar activity patterns are broadcast by CSN populations targeting different striatal circuits. Our results reveal a logic of coordinated connectivity between forebrain and spinal circuits, where separate CSN modules broadcast similarly complex information to downstream circuits, suggesting that differences in postsynaptic connectivity dictate motor specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3209827614,"Synucleins, a family of three proteins highly expressed in neurons, are predominantly known for the direct involvement of α-synuclein in the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's and certain other neurodegenerative diseases, but their precise physiological functions are still not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of α-synuclein as a modulator of various mechanisms implicated in chemical neurotransmission, but information concerning the involvement of other synuclein family members, β-synuclein and γ-synuclein, in molecular processes within presynaptic terminals is limited. Here, we demonstrated that the vesicular monoamine transporter 2-dependent dopamine uptake by synaptic vesicles isolated from the striatum of mice lacking β-synuclein is significantly reduced. Reciprocally, reintroduction, either in vivo or in vitro, of β-synuclein but not α-synuclein or γ-synuclein improves uptake by triple α/β/γ-synuclein-deficient striatal vesicles. We also showed that the resistance of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta to subchronic administration of the Parkinson's disease-inducing prodrug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine depends on the presence of β-synuclein but only when one or both other synucleins are absent. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of synuclein-deficient synaptic vesicles versus those containing only β-synuclein revealed differences in their protein compositions. We suggest that the observed potentiation of dopamine uptake by β-synuclein might be caused by different protein architecture of the synaptic vesicles. It is also feasible that such structural changes improve synaptic vesicle sequestration of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, a toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which would explain why dopaminergic neurons expressing β-synuclein and lacking α-synuclein and/or γ-synuclein are resistant to this neurotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W3208966261,"Natural products are an important source of lead compounds for the development of drug substances. Actinomycetes have been valuable especially for the discovery of antibiotics. Increasing occurrence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has revived the interest in actinomycete natural product research. Actinobacteria produce a different set of natural products when cultivated on solid growth media compared with submersed culture. Bioactivity assays involving solid media (e.g. agar-plug assays) require manual manipulation of the strains and agar plugs. This is less convenient for the screening of larger strain collections of several hundred or thousand strains. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a 96-well microplate-based system suitable for the screening of actinomycete strain collections in agar-plug assays. We developed a medium-throughput cultivation and agar-plug assay workflow that allows the convenient inoculation of solid agar plugs with actinomycete spore suspensions from a strain collection, and the transfer of the agar plugs to petri dishes to conduct agar-plug bioactivity assays. The development steps as well as the challenges that were overcome during the development (e.g. system sterility, handling of the agar plugs) are described. We present the results from one exemplary screening campaign targeted to identify compounds inhibiting Agr-based quorum sensing where the workflow was used successfully. We present a novel and convenient workflow to combine agar diffusion assays with microtiter-plate-based cultivation systems in which strains can grow on a solid surface. This workflow facilitates and speeds up the initial medium throughput screening of natural product-producing actinomycete strain collections against monitor strains in agar-plug assays."
https://openalex.org/W3209477965,"This study contributes towards the realization of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 which aims ""take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"" by investigating the role of per capita income in moderating the impact of energy use on carbon emissions. Using data from 28 selected African countries covering 1990 to 2019 and deploying the FGLS, PCSE, and MM-QR techniques, findings reveal, among others, that: at the 1% significance level, a percentage change in energy use leads to between 0.60% and 0.70% increase in carbon emissions, on average, ceteris paribus. Correspondingly, income shows to be a positive driver of emissions contributing between 0.87% and 0.84% percentage increase, on average, ceteris paribus. Also, per capita income attenuates the impact of energy use on emissions by between -0.27% and -0.23%, on average, ceteris paribus. However, significant heterogeneities occur across the sub-regions. Specifically, Southern Africa shows the largest energy contributor to emissions 1.65% while Central Africa contributes the most to aggravating emissions by 1.87% through increase in per capita income. West Africa shows the largest moderation effect at -0.56%. Across the quartiles, the effects of energy use and per capita are positive. Given these, we submit that the strong correlation between energy usage and per capita income (i.e. economic growth) poses a dilemma for African economies in their drive for growth. Leaving room for trade-offs. Perhaps, the lesson is that as African countries seek for more development without contributing to carbon emissions, governments should invest more in renewable energy."
https://openalex.org/W3210486346,"The present study describes the probiotic potential and functional properties of the lactic acid bacterium Pediococcus pentosaceus OBK05 isolated from buttermilk. The isolate OBK05 was assessed for its probiotic properties. The isolate showed notable tolerance to pH 2.0 and 3.0 (8.44, 8.35 log CFU/mL), oxbile of 0.5% at 2 and 4 h of incubation (6.97, 6.35 log CFU/mL) and higher aggregation (auto-aggregation, adhesion to hydrocarbons) than the referral strain, Lactobacillus acidophilus MTCC 10307. The adhesion efficiency to HT-29 cells was found to be maximum, corresponding to 93.5% and 97% at 1 and 2 h incubation, respectively. In addition, the isolate OBK05 showed antagonistic solid activity against bacterial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 424 and Bacillus subtilis MTCC 1133. The phenotypic antibiotic resistance of the isolate was examined before and after curing plasmids. Among the known five structural genes responsible for different antibiotic resistance, four genes indicating antibiotic resistance to kanamycin-Aph (3´´)-III, streptomycin-strA, vancomycin-vanA and ciprofloxacin-gyrA were detected by PCR amplification of genomic DNA. Further, the horizontal gene transfer from OBK05 isolate to pathogens was not found for these antibiotic resistance markers when filter and food mating were carried out as no transconjugants developed on media plates containing respective antibiotics. This indicates that the intrinsic resistance is harbored on chromosomal genes, and hence it is nontransferable to other microbes. In addition, strain OBK05 exhibited good DPPH scavenging activity of 56 to 77% and liberated free amino acid from conjugated bile acid. The strain OBK05 demonstrated a strong ability to reduce cholesterol at 12 h (17%), 24 h (27%) and 48 h (67%) of incubation."
https://openalex.org/W3208468550,"Cycline-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), an enzyme of the cycline dependent or Ser/Thr protein kinase family, plays a role in cell cycle progression (G1 phase) by phosphorylating a tumor suppressor protein called pRB. Alteration of this enzyme due to missense mutation/ nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are responsible for various types of cancer progression, e.g. melanoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. Hence, this study is designed to identify the malignant missense mutation of CDK4 from the single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP) by incorporating computational algorithms. Out of 239 nsSNPs; G15S, D140Y and D140H were predicted to be highly malignant variants which may have a devastating impact on protein structure or function. We also found defective binding motif of these three mutants with the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and ATP. However, by incorporating molecular dynamic simulation, our study concludes that the superiority of G15S than the other two mutants (D140Y and D140H) in destabilizing proteins nature."

https://openalex.org/W3208845199,"In autoimmune diseases, fibroblasts produce and secrete various cytokines and act as sentinel immune cells during inflammatory states. However, the contribution of sentinel immune cells (i.e. dermal fibroblasts) in autoimmune diseases of the skin, such as atopic dermatitis, has been obscure. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) induces the expression of chemokines, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), in autoimmune diseases of the skin. IL-8 induces the activation and recruitment of innate immune cells such as neutrophils to the site of inflammation. IL-1β-mediated induction of IL-8 expression is important for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases; however, the intracellular singling remains to be understood. To elucidate the mechanism of the onset of autoimmune diseases, we established a model for IL-1β-induced dermatitis and investigated MAPK signaling pathways in IL-1β-induced IL-8 expression. We also identified that a MAP3K Tpl2 acts as an upstream modulator of IL-1β-induced ERK1/2 activation in dermal fibroblasts. We observed an increase in the expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein in cells treated with IL-1β. ERK1/2 inhibitors significantly reduced IL-1β-induced IL-8 expression, whereas the inhibitor for p38 MAPK or JNK had no effect. IL-1β induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was attenuated in the presence of an ERK1/2 inhibitor. IL-1β failed to induce IL-8 expression in cells transfected with siRNA for ERK1, or ERK2. Notably, a Tpl2 inhibitor reduced IL-1β-induced IL-8 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We confirmed that the silencing of Tpl2 in siRNA-transfected fibroblasts prevented both in IL-1β-induced IL-8 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data indicate the importance of Tpl2 in the modulation of ERK1/2 signaling involved in the IL-1β-induced development of autoimmune diseases affecting the dermal tissue, such as atopic dermatitis."
https://openalex.org/W4226084008,"The interplay between growth factors, signaling pathways and transcription factors during placental development is key to controlling trophoblast differentiation. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been implicated in trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling during early placental development. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these are accomplished have not been fully elucidated, particularly for transcriptional regulation of key transcription factors. Here, we identified SOX4 as a direct target gene induced by BMP2 in first-trimester placental trophoblasts. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from first-trimester placentas and decidua tissues revealed that SOX4 expression is mainly localized in extravillous trophoblast and decidual stromal cells. Moreover, gain- and loss-of-function approaches demonstrated that SOX4 exerts a pro-invasive role in human trophoblasts, and this effect contributes to BMP2-enhanced trophoblast invasion. Importantly, we found that SOX4 was required for BMP2-induced regulation of a subset of genes associated with cell migration and extracellular matrix organization. We also show that SOX4-dependent regulation of the BMP2 target SERPINE2 occurs via binding of SOX4 to regulatory elements such as enhancers, thereby promoting BMP2-induced trophoblast invasion. In conclusion, these findings uncover a novel mechanism involving SOX4 that shapes the BMP2-regulated transcriptional network during invasive trophoblast development."
https://openalex.org/W4226450362,"The long-term use of adrenergic medication in treating various conditions, such as asthma, increases the chances of bone fracture. Dynamic mechanical loading at a specific time is a method for improving bone quality and promoting healing. Therefore, we hypothesized that precisely controlling the mechanical environment can contribute to the alleviation of the negative effects of chronic treatment with the common asthma drug terbutaline, which is a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist that facilitates bone homeostasis and defect repair through its anabolic effect on osteogenic cells. Our in vitro results showed that terbutaline can directly inhibit osteogenesis by impairing osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. Chronic treatment in vivo was simulated by administering terbutaline to C57BL/6J mice for 4 weeks before bone defect surgery and mechanical loading. We utilized a stabilized tibial defect model, which allowed the application of anabolic mechanical loading. During homeostasis, chronic terbutaline treatment reduced the bone formation rate, the fracture toughness of long bones, and the concentrations of bone formation markers in the sera. During defect repair, terbutaline decreased the bone volume, type H vessel, and total blood vessel volume. Terbutaline treatment reduced the number of osteogenic cells. Periostin, which was secreted mainly by Prrx1+ osteoprogenitors and F4/80+ macrophages, was inhibited by treating the bone defect with terbutaline. Interestingly, controlled mechanical loading facilitated the recovery of bone volume and periostin expression and the number of osteogenic cells within the defect. In conclusion, mechanical loading can rescue negative effects on new bone accrual and repair induced by chronic terbutaline treatment."

This study investigated the effect of RGP inclusion in diets of Hy-line Silver Brown cockerels on physiological and meat quality responses. Five isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets were formulated by mixing a standard grower diet with RGP at 0 (G0), 15 (G15), 30 (G30), 45 (G45) and 60 g/kg (G60). A total of 250, 5-week-old cockerels (304.6 ± 6.57 g live-weight) were evenly allocated to 25 pens replicated 5 times per experimental diet. No linear and quadratic trends (P > 0.05) were observed for overall feed intake, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and meat quality traits as dietary RGP levels increased. Erythrocytes linearly decreased (P < 0.05), whereas mean corpuscular hemoglobin and urea linearly increased (P < 0.05) with RGP levels. There were significant quadratic effects for glucose, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and cholesterol, from which a maximum RGP inclusion level was calculated to be 43 g/kg. In conclusion, dietary red grape pomace had no adverse effect on physiological parameters and meat quality traits of Hy-line Silver Brown cockerels. However, including red grape pomace beyond 43 g/kg could compromise serum biochemical parameters of the birds."
https://openalex.org/W3209571010,"The LIM-domain containing protein Ajuba and the scaffold protein SQSTM1/p62 regulate signalling of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in osteoclast differentiation and survival. The ubiquitin-associated domain of SQSTM1/p62 is frequently mutated in patients with Paget's disease of bone. Here, we report that Ajuba activates NF-κB activity in HEK293 cells, and that co-expression with SQSTM1/p62 inhibits this activation in an UBA domain-dependent manner. SQSTM1/p62 regulates proteins by targeting them to the ubiquitin-proteasome system or the autophagy-lysosome pathway. We show that Ajuba is degraded by autophagy, however co-expression with SQSTM1/p62 (wild type or UBA-deficient) protects Ajuba levels both in cells undergoing autophagy and those exposed to proteasomal stress. Additionally, in unstressed cells co-expression of SQSTM1/p62 reduces the amount of Ajuba present in the nucleus. SQSTM1/p62 with an intact ubiquitin-associated domain forms holding complexes with Ajuba that are not destined for degradation yet inhibit signalling. Thus, in situations with altered levels and localization of SQSTM1/p62 expression, such as osteoclasts in Paget's disease of bone and various cancers, SQSTM1/p62 may compartmentalize Ajuba and thereby impact its cellular functions and disease pathogenesis. In Paget's, ubiquitin-associated domain mutations may lead to increased or prolonged Ajuba-induced NF-κB signalling leading to increased osteoclastogenesis. In cancer, Ajuba expression promotes cell survival. The increased levels of SQSTM1/p62 observed in cancer may enhance Ajuba-mediated cancer cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W3209969463,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication timing and double-strand break repair, and its depletion induces transcriptional bursting of two-cell (2C) zygote-specific genes in mouse ES cells. However, how Rif1 regulates zygotic transcription is unclear. We show here that Rif1 depletion promotes the formation of a unique Zscan4 enhancer structure harboring both histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and moderate levels of silencing chromatin mark H3K9me3. Curiously, another enhancer mark H3K4me1 is missing, whereas DNA methylation is still maintained in the structure, which spreads across gene bodies and neighboring regions within the Zscan4 gene cluster. We also found by function analyses of Rif1 domains in ES cells that ectopic expression of Rif1 lacking N-terminal domain results in upregulation of 2C transcripts. This appears to be caused by dominant negative inhibition of endogenous Rif1 protein localization at the nuclear periphery through formation of hetero-oligomers between the N-terminally truncated and endogenous forms. Strikingly, in murine 2C embryos, most of Rif1-derived polypeptides are expressed as truncated forms in soluble nuclear or cytosolic fraction and are likely nonfunctional. Toward the morula stage, the full-length form of Rif1 gradually increased. Our results suggest that the absence of the functional full-length Rif1 due to its instability or alternative splicing and potential inactivation of Rif1 through dominant inhibition by N-terminally truncated Rif1 polypeptides may be involved in 2C-specific transcription program."
https://openalex.org/W3210468741,"Most benthic marine invertebrates with sedentary benthic adult phases have planktonic larvae that permit connectivity between geographically isolated populations. Planktonic larval duration and oceanographic processes are vital to connecting populations of species inhabiting remote and distant islands. In the present study, we analyzed the population genetic structure of the sea urchin Centrostephanus sylviae, which inhabits only the Juan Fernández Archipelago and the Desventuradas islands, separated by more than 800 km. For 92 individuals collected from Robinson Crusoe and Selkirk Islands (Juan Fernández Archipelago) and San Ambrosio Island (Desventuradas Islands), 7,067 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. The results did not show a spatial genetic structure for C. sylviae; relative high migration rates were revealed between the islands. An analysis of the water circulation pattern in the area described a predominant northward water flow with periods of inverted flow, suggesting that larvae could move in both directions.

Schwann cell dysfunction and axonal loss are integral factors in pathophysiology and disease progression of polyneuropathy. Aims The aim of this study was the assessment of Schwann cell characteristics, nerve fibers and myelination parameters in polyneuropathy patients compared to controls. Methods Nerve tissue was obtained from polyneuropathy patients (n = 10) undergoing diagnostic sural nerve biopsies. Biopsies of healthy peripheral nerves (n = 5) were harvested during elective sural nerve grafting for chronic peripheral nerve lesions. Exclusion criteria for the healthy control group were recent neurological trauma, diabetes, neurological and cardiovascular disease, as well as active malignancies and cytotoxic medication within the last 12 months. The over-all architecture of nerve sections and myelination parameters were histomorphometrically analyzed. Immunofluorescent imaging was used to evaluate Schwann cell phenotypes, senescence markers and myelination parameters. Results Histomorphometric analysis of nerve biopsies showed significant axonal loss in polyneuropathy patients compared to controls, which was in accordance with the neuropathological findings. Immunofluorescent staining of Schwann cells and myelin basic protein indicated a significant impairment of myelination and lower Schwann cell counts compared to controls. Phenotypic alterations and increased numbers of non-myelinating p75-positive Schwann cells were found in polyneuropathy patients. Discussion This study provided quantitative data of axonal loss, reduced myelination and Schwann cell dysfunction of polyneuropathy patients compared to neurologically healthy controls. Phenotypic alterations of Schwann cells were similar to those seen after peripheral nerve injury, highlighting the clinical relevance of Schwann cell dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3208479023,"Farmland is on the decline and worldwide food security is at risk. Rice is the staple of choice for over half the Earth's people. To sustain current demands and ascertain a food secure future, substandard farmland affected by abiotic stresses must be utilized. For rapid crop improvement, a broader understanding of polygenic traits like stress tolerance and crop yield is indispensable. To this end, the hidden diversity of resilient and neglected wild varieties must be traced back to their genetic roots. In this study, we separately assayed 11 phenotypes in a panel of 176 diverse accessions predominantly comprised of local landraces from Bangladesh. We compiled high resolution sequence data for these accessions. We collectively studied the ties between the observed phenotypic differences and the examined additive genetic effects underlying these variations. We applied a fixed effect model to associate phenotypes with genotypes on a genomic scale. Discovered QTLs were mapped to known genes. Our explorations yielded 13 QTLs related to various traits in multiple trait classes. 10 identified QTLs were equivalent to findings from previous studies. Integrative analysis assumes potential novel functionality for a number of candidate genes. These findings will usher novel avenues for the bioengineering of high yielding crops of the future fortified with genetic defenses against abiotic stressors."
https://openalex.org/W3208787401,"Ensuring water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities for households remains a major public health concern in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study investigated the current situation of basic WASH facilities for households in Bangladesh and drew a national coverage map.We analyzed the publicly available nationally representative 2019 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) dataset that was carried out by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) with support from the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). A total of 61,209 households (weighted) were included in the analysis. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed to examine the relationships between independent variables (socio-demographic and economic status) and their distributions over outcome variables (basic water, sanitation, and hygiene). Further, the spatial distribution of WASH facilities at the household level was depicted.Coverage of access to basic water facilities at the household level was 99.5% (95% CI 99.4% to 99.6%), sanitation 60.7% (95% CI 60.0% to 61.5%), and hygiene 56.3% (95% CI 55.6% to 57.0%). However, coverage of combined access to all three components was 40.2% (95% CI 39.4% to 40.9%). Among all 64 administrative districts of Bangladesh, we found comparatively lower coverage of WASH facilities in the South and South-East regions and relatively higher in the households of the North and North-Western regions. An adjusted regression model revealed that richest households [AOR = 29.64, 95% CI 26.31 to 33.39], households in the rural areas [AOR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.79], household heads with higher educational attainment [AOR = 2.28, 95% CI 2.09 to 2.49], and households with 5+ family members [AOR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.71] had the higher likelihood to have basic WASH facilities.Less than half of the Bangladeshi households had access to all three major WASH components (basic water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities); however, variation exists at the individual parameter of basic water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. A comprehensive WASH approach may reduce the gap and improve the quality of WASH facilities in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3208857695,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne's disease (JD), and it causes diarrhea and weakness in cattle. During a long subclinical stage, infected animals without clinical signs shed pathogens through feces. For this reason, the diagnosis of JD during the subclinical stage is very important. Circulating miRNAs are attracting attention as useful biomarkers in various veterinary diseases because of their expression changes depending on the state of the disease. Based on current knowledge, circulating miRNAs extracted from bovine serum were used to develop a diagnostic tool for JD. In this study, the animals were divided into 4 groups according to fecal shedding, the presence of antibodies, and clinical signs. Gene expression was analyzed by performing miRNA sequencing for each group, and it was identified that the miRNA expression changed more as the MAP infection progressed. The eight miRNAs that were differentially expressed in all infected groups were selected as biomarker candidates based on their significant differences compared to the control group. These biomarker candidates were validated by qRT-PCR. Considering the sequencing data, two upregulated miRNAs and two downregulated miRNAs showed the same trend in the validation results. Network analysis was also conducted and the results showed that mRNAs (IL-10, TGF-β1) associated with regulatory T cells were predicted to be activated in the subclinical stage. Taken together, our data suggest that two miRNAs (bta-miR-374b, bta-miR-2887) may play major roles in the immune response to MAP infection during the subclinical stage."
https://openalex.org/W3209014098,"Sensory neurons are modulated by context. For example, in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to the preferred orientation are modulated by the presence of superimposed orientations (""plaids""). The effects of this modulation are diverse; some neurons are suppressed, while others have larger responses to a plaid than its components. We investigated whether this diversity could be explained by a unified circuit mechanism. We report that this masking is maintained during suppression of cortical activity, arguing against cortical mechanisms. Instead, the heterogeneity of plaid responses is explained by an interaction between stimulus geometry and orientation tuning. Highly selective neurons are uniformly suppressed by plaids, whereas the effects in weakly selective neurons depend on the spatial configuration of the stimulus, transitioning systematically between suppression and facilitation. Thus, the diverse responses emerge as a consequence of the spatial structure of feedforward inputs, with no need to invoke cortical interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3209160374,"Retinoic acid (RA) plays major roles during nervous system development, and during regeneration of the adult nervous system. We have previously shown that components of the RA signaling pathway are upregulated after optic nerve injury, and that exogenous application of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) greatly increases the survival of axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of ATRA application on the macrophages in the optic nerve after injury, and to determine whether this affects axonal regeneration. The optic nerve was crushed and treated with PBS, ATRA and/or clodronate-loaded liposomes. Nerves were examined at one and two weeks after axotomy with light microscopy, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. ATRA application to the optic nerve caused transient increases in the number of macrophages and microglia one week after injury. The macrophages are consistently labeled with M2-type markers, and have considerable phagocytic activity. ATRA increased ultrastructural features of ongoing phagocytic activity in macrophages at one and two weeks. ATRA treatment also significantly increased the numbers of regenerating GAP-43-labeled axons. Clodronate liposome treatment depleted macrophage numbers by 80%, completely eliminated the ATRA-mediated increase in axonal regeneration, and clodronate treatment alone decreased axonal numbers by 30%. These results suggest that the success of axon regeneration is partially dependent on the presence of debris-phagocytosing macrophages, and that the increases in regeneration caused by ATRA are in part due to their increased numbers. Further studies will examine whether macrophage depletion affects RGC survival."

Some young women who had unintended pregnancies obtain an abortion while others carry their pregnancies to term, incurring the risk of morbidity and mortality higher than those for adult women. Despite the availability of highly effective methods of contraception, different studies in Ethiopia revealed that there is a high level of unintended pregnancy.To assess the magnitude of unintended pregnancy and associated factors among currently pregnant married youths in Kiremu district.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among currently pregnant married 15-24 years women. Multi-stage stratified sampling technique was used to select 434 study units. Ten kebeles were randomly selected and samples were selected from each of ten kebeles by simple random sampling using kebeles household identification numbers as the sampling frame. Quantitative data was entered with SPSS version 20 and crude and adjusted odds ratio together with their 95%CI were computed and interpreted accordingly. A p-value<0.05 was considered to declare a result as statistically significant in this study. In-depth interviews and transcripts of the recorded discussions were coded and analyzed thematically. The results were finally presented in texts, tables, and graphs.Unintended pregnancies among currently pregnant married young women in the study area were 31.1%. Educational status (AOR = 3.195,95%CI = 1.757,5.811),being Gov't employee (AOR = 0.039, 95% CI = 0.002,0.988), ever heard contraceptives(AOR = 0.260, 95%CI = 0.077, 0.876), ever used contraceptives (AOR = 0.348,95%CI = 0.168,0.717),discussion about contraceptives with husband(AOR = 0.027,95%CI = 0.015, 0.050),fear of side effect of contraceptives (AOR = 5.819,95% CI = 1.438,23.422), autonomy on health (AOR = 0.122,95%CI = 0.035,0.431), age at first marriage (AOR = 3.195, 95%CI = 1.757,5.811), age first pregnancy(AOR = 23.660,95%CI = 12.573,44.522), being visited by health care providers (AOR = 0.202,95%CI = 0.073,0.566) and average birth interval (AOR = 3.472,95%CI = 1.392,8.61) were the factors associated with unintended pregnancy.Significant proportion of women had an unintended pregnancy in the study area. Therefore, emphasis should be given to married youths especially on women empowerment, encouraging partner discussions, and providing appropriate counseling on contraceptive side effects by giving due attention to those marred at younger ages (<18 years)."
https://openalex.org/W3209188975,"Binding of phosphorylated eIFiso4E with viral genome-linked protein (VPg) of turnip mosaic virus was examined by stopped-flow, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and molecular docking analysis. Phosphorylation of eIFiso4E increased (4-fold) the binding rates as compared to unphosphorylated eIFiso4E with VPg. Stopped-flow kinetic studies of phosphorylated eIFiso4E with VPg showed a concentration-independent conformational change. The dissociation rate was about 3-fold slower for eIFiso4E∙VPg complex upon phosphorylation. Phosphorylation enhanced the association rates and lowered the dissociation rates for the eIFiso4E∙VPg binding, with having higher preferential binding to eIFiso4Ep. Binding rates for the interaction of eIFiso4Ep with VPg increased (6-fold) with an increase in temperature, 278 K to 298 K. The activation energies for binding of eIFiso4Ep and eIFiso4E with VPg were 37.2 ± 2.8 and 52.6 ± 3.6 kJ/mol, respectively. Phosphorylation decreased the activation energy for the binding of eIFiso4E to VPg. The reduced energy barrier suggests more stable platform for eIFiso4Ep∙VPg initiation complex formation, which was further supported by molecular docking analysis. Moreover, far-UV CD studies revealed that VPg formed complex with eIFiso4Ep with substantial change in the secondary structure. These results suggested that phosphorylation, not only reduced the energy barrier and dissociation rate but also enhanced binding rate, and an overall conformational change, which provides a more stable platform for efficient viral translation."
https://openalex.org/W3210063353,"Microstructure imaging with advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) techniques have shown increased sensitivity and specificity to microstructural changes in various disease and injury models. Oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) dMRI, implemented by varying the oscillating gradient frequency, and microscopic anisotropy (μA) dMRI, implemented via tensor valued diffusion encoding, may provide additional insight by increasing sensitivity to smaller spatial scales and disentangling fiber orientation dispersion from true microstructural changes, respectively. The aims of this study were to characterize the test-retest reproducibility of in vivo OGSE and μA dMRI metrics in the mouse brain at 9.4 Tesla and provide estimates of required sample sizes for future investigations.Twelve adult C57Bl/6 mice were scanned twice (5 days apart). Each imaging session consisted of multifrequency OGSE and μA dMRI protocols. Metrics investigated included μA, linear diffusion kurtosis, isotropic diffusion kurtosis, and the diffusion dispersion rate (Λ), which explores the power-law frequency dependence of mean diffusivity. The dMRI metric maps were analyzed with mean region-of-interest (ROI) and whole brain voxel-wise analysis. Bland-Altman plots and coefficients of variation (CV) were used to assess the reproducibility of OGSE and μA metrics. Furthermore, we estimated sample sizes required to detect a variety of effect sizes.Bland-Altman plots showed negligible biases between test and retest sessions. ROI-based CVs revealed high reproducibility for most metrics (CVs < 15%). Voxel-wise CV maps revealed high reproducibility for μA (CVs ~ 10%), but low reproducibility for OGSE metrics (CVs ~ 50%).Most of the μA dMRI metrics are reproducible in both ROI-based and voxel-wise analysis, while the OGSE dMRI metrics are only reproducible in ROI-based analysis. Given feasible sample sizes (10-15), μA metrics and OGSE metrics may provide sensitivity to subtle microstructural changes (4-8%) and moderate changes (> 6%), respectively."

The sample comprised dental students of both genders, 154 from a university in New York, USA (response rate 91.1%) and 459 from two universities in Brazil (response rate 79.1%). University engagement was measured using the USEI. The samples were characterized by gender and academic level.The refined reduced version of the USEI presented adequate fit to the samples from both countries. Gender was associated with the behavioral engagement factor of the USEI in Brazilian students. In the USA sample, gender was associated with the behavioral and cognitive engagement factors. There was a significant effect of academic level on behavioral and emotional engagement for the Brazilian and USA samples, respectively.The refined reduced USEI presented adequate psychometric qualities for the study samples."
https://openalex.org/W3210235209,"Peptide conformation can change subject to environment cues. This concept also applies to many cationic amphipathic peptides (CAPs) known to have cell membrane lytic or penetrative activities. Well-conditioned CAPs can match the properties of the target membrane to support their intended biological functions, e.g., intracellular cargo delivery; however, the intricacy in such conditioning surpasses our current understanding. Here we focused on hydrophobicity, a key biophysical property that dictates the membrane activity of CAPs, and applied a structure-function strategy to evolve a template peptide for endosomolytic cargo delivery. The template was subjected to iterative adjustment to balance hydrophobicity between its N-terminal linear and C-terminal helical domains. We demonstrate that the obtained peptide, LP6, could dramatically promote cargo cell entry and facilitate cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules such as FITC-dextran, saporin, and human IgG. Among the evolved peptide series, LP6 has low cytotoxicity and moderate hydrophobicity, exhibits maximum change in helical conformation in response to negatively charged phospholipids, and also shows an apparent aggregational behavior in response to sialic acid enrichment. These attributes of LP6 collectively indicate that its anion-responsive conformational change is a critical underlining of its endosomolytic cargo delivery capability. Our results also suggest that modulation of hydrophobicity serves as a key to the precise tuning of CAP's membrane activity for future biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3210626984,"The increasing incidence of carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical concern worldwide owing to the limitations of therapeutic alternatives. The most important carbapenem resistance mechanism for A . baumannii is the enzymatic hydrolysis mediated by carbapenemases, mostly OXA-type carbapenemases (class D) and, to a lesser extent, metallo-β-lactamases (class B). Therefore, early and accurate detection of carbapenemase-producing A . baumannii is required to achieve the therapeutic efficacy of such infections. Many methods for carbapenemase detection have been proposed as effective tests for A . baumannii ; however, none of them are officially recommended. In this study, three carbapenemase detection methods, namely, CarbaAcineto NP test, modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM), and simplified carbapenem inactivation method (sCIM) were evaluated for phenotypic detection of clinically isolated A . baumannii . The MICs of imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem were determined for 123 clinically isolated A . baumannii strains before performing three phenotypic detections. The overall sensitivity and specificity values were 89.09%/100% for the carbAcineto NP test, 71.82%/100% for sCIM, and 32.73%/33.13% for mCIM. CarbAcineto NP test and sCIM performed excellently (100% sensitivity) when both Class B and Class D carbapenemases were present in the same isolate. Based on the results, the combined detection method of sCIM and CarbAcineto NP test was proposed to detect carbapenemase-producing A . baumannii rather than a single assay, significantly increasing the sensitivity of detection to 98.18%. The proposed algorithm was more reliable and cost-effective than the CarbAcineto NP test alone. It can be easily applied in routine microbiology laboratories for developing countries with limited resources."
https://openalex.org/W2957688653,"Every day, people make many food decisions without thinking, repeatedly falling for the unhealthy option instead of the healthy option. While making these mindless decisions, people often rely on heuristics. In this paper, we demonstrate that these heuristics can be exploited to nudge consumers towards healthy alternatives. Specifically, we explore how the attraction effect (i.e., adding a decoy to a choice set) can nudge people to choose a healthy snack. The results of our choice experiment indicate that adding a decoy (i.e., a less attractive food alternative) to a self-control situation (i.e., choosing between a healthy and an unhealthy food alternative) can help people maintain self-control and choose the healthy option. This mixed choice set thus nudges people towards the healthy option. Moreover, our results show differential effects of the attraction effect depending on the (un)healthiness of the products in the choice set. Specifically, the attraction effect is prominent when the choice set consists of unhealthy products only (i.e., the unhealthy choice set), but not in the choice set that consists of only healthy products (i.e., healthy choice set). Importantly, our results indicate when the attraction effect can exploit consumers' heuristics to help them make better, healthier food choices."
https://openalex.org/W3208099465,"Enhancers are vitally important during embryonic development to control the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Recently, large scale genome projects have identified a vast number of putative developmental regulatory elements. However, the proportion of these that have been functionally assessed is relatively low. While enhancers have traditionally been studied using reporter assays, this approach does not characterise their contribution to endogenous gene expression. We have studied the murine Nestin (Nes) intron 2 enhancer, which is widely used to direct exogenous gene expression within neural progenitor cells in cultured cells and in vivo. We generated CRISPR deletions of the enhancer region in mice and assessed their impact on Nes expression during embryonic development. Loss of the Nes neural enhancer significantly reduced Nes expression in the developing CNS by as much as 82%. By assessing NES protein localization, we also show that this enhancer region contains repressor element(s) that inhibit Nes expression within the vasculature. Previous reports have stated that Nes is an essential gene, and its loss causes embryonic lethality. We also generated 2 independent Nes null lines and show that both develop without any obvious phenotypic effects. Finally, through crossing of null and enhancer deletion mice we provide evidence of trans-chromosomal interaction of the Nes enhancer and promoter."
https://openalex.org/W3209233323,"Selective markers are generally indispensable in plant genetic transformation, of which the frequently used are of antibiotic or herbicide resistance. However, the increasing concerns on transgenic biosafety have encouraged many new and safe selective markers emerging, with an eminent representative as phosphite (Phi) in combination to its dehydrogenase (PTDH, e.g. PtxD). As bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) can resemble PtxD to oxidatively convert toxic Phi into metabolizable phosphate (Pi), herein we harnessed it as the substitute of PtxD to develop an alternative Phi-based selection system. We first validated the Escherichia coli BAP (EcBAP) did own an extra enzymatic activity of oxidizing Phi to Pi. We further revealed EcBAP could be used as a dominant selective marker for Agrobacterium-mediated tobacco transformation. Although the involved Phi selection for transformed tobacco cells surprisingly required the presence of Pi, it showed a considerable transformation efficiency and dramatically accelerated transformation procedure, as compared to the routine kanamycin selection and the well-known PtxD/Phi system. Moreover, the EcBAP transgenic tobaccos could metabolize toxic Phi as a phosphorus (P) fertilizer thus underlying Phi-resistance, and competitively possess a dominant growth over wild-type tobacco and weeds under Phi stress. Therefore, this novel BAP/Phi-coupled system, integrating multiple advantages covering biosafe dominant selective marker, plant P utilization and weed management, can provide a PTDH-bypass technological choice to engineer transgenic plant species, especially those of great importance for sustainable agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3210076193,"Prion diseases are progressive, neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and animals. Also known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, for the hallmark spongiform change seen in the brain, these diseases manifest increased oxidative damage early in disease and changes in antioxidant enzymes in terminal brain tissue. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) is an antioxidant enzyme that is critical for life. SOD2 knock-out mice can only be kept alive for several weeks post-birth and only with antioxidant therapy. However, this results in the development of a spongiform encephalopathy. Consequently, we hypothesized that reduced levels of SOD2 may accelerate prion disease progression and play a critical role in the formation of spongiform change. Using SOD2 heterozygous knock-out and litter mate wild-type controls, we examined neuronal long-term potentiation, disease duration, pathology, and degree of spongiform change in mice infected with three strains of mouse adapted scrapie. No influence of the reduced SOD2 expression was observed in any parameter measured for any strain. We conclude that changes relating to SOD2 during prion disease are most likely secondary to the disease processes causing toxicity and do not influence the development of spongiform pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3210180877,"The choice of revegetating via direct seeding or planting nursery-grown seedlings influences the potential stresses suffered by seedlings such as herbivory and drought. The outcome of the balance between both revegetation methods may ultimately depend on how species identity and traits such as seed and seedling size interact with environmental conditions. To test this, we will conduct a continental-scale experiment consisting of one mini-experiment replicated by multiple participants across Europe. Each participant will establish a site with seeded and planted individuals of one or more native, locally growing oak ( Quercus ) species; the selection of this genus aims to favour continental-scale participation and to allow testing the response of a widely distributed genus of broad ecological and economic relevance. At each site, participants will follow the present protocol for seed collection, seeding in the field, nursery cultivation, outplanting, protection against herbivores, site maintenance, and measurement of seedling performance and environmental variables. Each measurement on each species at each site will produce one effect size; the data will be analysed through mixed-effects meta-analysis. With this approach we will assess the main effect of revegetation method, species, plant functional traits, and the potential effect of site-specific effect moderators. Overall, we will provide a continental-scale estimate on the seeding vs . planting dilemma and analyse to what extent the differences in environmental conditions across sites, seed size, functional traits, and the phylogenetic relatedness of species can account for the differences in the effect of revegetation method on seedling performance across study sites and species."

Many studies have suggested that genetic factors are important risk factors for OA, of which tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is one of the most examined genes. Moreover, several studies have investigated the relationship between TNF-α G-308A polymorphisms and OA risk, but consistent results have not been obtained.This study examines the association between TNF-α G-308A polymorphisms and knee OA. Moreover, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to determine whether this is a susceptibility gene for knee OA.Between 2015 and 2019, 591 knee OA cases and 536 healthy controls were recruited. The Kellgren-Lawrence grading system was used to identify the knee OA cases. A meta-analysis was conducted including related studies published until 2020 from PubMed, Embase, and previous meta-analysis to improve the evidence level of the current study. The results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate the effect of this polymorphism on knee OA risk. The TSA was used to estimate the sample sizes required in this issue.A nonsignificant association was found between the AA genotype and knee OA [adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.15) in the recessive model] in the present case-control study, and analysis of other genetic models showed a similar trend. After adding the critical case-control samples for Asians, the TNF-α G-308A, AA genotype exhibited 2.57 times more risk of developing arthritis when compared with the GG + GA genotype (95% CI, 1.56-4.23), and the cumulative samples for TSA (n = 2182) were sufficient to obtain a definite conclusion.The results of this meta-analysis revealed that the TNF-α G-308A, AA genotype is a susceptible genotype for OA in the Asian population. This study integrated all current evidence to arrive at this conclusion, suggesting that future studies on Asians are not required."
