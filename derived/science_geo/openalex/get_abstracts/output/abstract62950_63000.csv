https://openalex.org/W1513087030,"Abstract Both human carbonic anhydrases B and C act as esterases on o- and p-nitrophenyl acetates. Enzyme C is the more active of the two for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate, and enzyme B for o-nitrophenyl acetate. The pH-activity curves are sigmoid, the esterase activity being very small below pH 6 and rising to a high level around pH 9; the inflection point lies at pH 7.3 for Enzyme B and at 6.8 for Enzyme C. The Km values are nearly independent of pH in all cases; thus the pH dependence curves appear to reflect the catalytic center activity. The reactions follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics over the range of substrate concentrations studied, but this range is limited to values less than the Km values, because of the limited solubility of the esters. Measurements in a stop-flow apparatus, at times from 10 msec to 2 sec, gave the same kinetic constants as those measured under steady state conditions. There was no evidence of an initial burst of release of nitrophenol. When the reactions were studied under the condition (E0) ≅ (S0) << Km, the process followed first order kinetics until hydrolysis was nearly complete. The data thus gave no evidence for the presence of an acyl intermediate; if such an intermediate exists it must be very rapidly hydrolyzed. Both enzymes are inhibited by monovalent anions, by acetazolamide, and by alcohols. Anion inhibition decreases with increasing pH, and so does the acetazolamide inhibition. The alcohol inhibition is not affected by pH. Enzyme B is somewhat more strongly inhibited by anions, but Enzyme C is much more strongly inhibited by alcohols and by acetazolamide. Only one site seems to be involved in the inhibition by either type of inhibitor. Competition for one site has been demonstrated between the anions and the alcohols. The inhibitions are reversible, and noncompetitive with respect to substrate. Since anion inhibition follows the lyotropic series, the binding site is believed not to be the zinc ion. Binding of anions by Enzyme B, and by zinc-free apoenzyme, has been demonstrated by an increase in pH of an isoionic solution caused by the addition of neutral salts. At low salt concentrations solutions of the apoenzyme show a lower change in pH than these of the holoenzyme, but at higher salt concentrations the values are very similar. Thus in 0.1 m KCl both the enzyme and apoenzyme bind approximately 6 chloride ions."
https://openalex.org/W2048918147,"Several workers have observed that there is an extremely close immunological resemblance between the serum albumins of apes and man. Our studies with the quantitative micro-complement fixation method confirm this observation. To explain the closeness of the resemblance, previous workers suggested that there has been a slowing down of albumin evolution since the time of divergence of apes and man. Recent evidence, however, indicates that the albumin molecule has evolved at a steady rate. Hence, we suggest that apes and man have a more recent common ancestry than is usually supposed. Our calculations lead to the suggestion that, if man and Old World monkeys last shared a common ancestor 30 million years ago, then man and African apes shared a common ancestor 5 million years ago, that is, in the Pliocene era."
https://openalex.org/W2106786926,"Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) form metallocarbonic anhydrases containing these metal ions at the same binding site. Of this series, only the Zn(II) and Co(II) enzymes catalyze the hydration of CO2 and the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. Likewise, only Zn(II) and Co(II) induce the metal ion-dependent binding of 3H-acetazolamide at the active center. Acetate, azide, cyanate, sulfide, and cyanide compete with 3H-acetazolamide for the binding site at the active center. Binding of 1 eq of sulfide and cyanide to the Zn(II) and Co(II) enzymes at pH values below the pKa values of H2S and HCN is accompanied by the release of H+ ions. Over the pH range in which the inhibitors are in the form CN- and HS-, binding is accompanied by the appearance of -OH ions. The experimental data fit the theoretical curves constructed by assuming a single additional H+ dissociation associated with the protein, coupled with the metal ion, and described by a pKa of 8.1. The latter coincides with the inflection point of the pH-rate profile for catalysis by human carbonic anhydrase B. Apo- and the inactive metallocarbonic anhydrases do not show the alterations in hydrogen ion equilibria accompanying the addition of CN-. Accompanying spectral data as a function of pH show that -OH, HCO3-, and CN- compete for the same binding site on the Co(II) enzyme. A mechanism based on a mixed enzyme-zinc-hydroxide as the active form of the enzyme is proposed for the hydration of CO2 and the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate."
https://openalex.org/W1544995918,"Abstract Colicin E2 and colicin E3 were purified from Escherichia coli W3110(ColE2) and W3110(ColE3), respectively, by salt extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex and carboxymethyl Sephadex. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugal characterization, immunochemical analysis, and isoelectric density gradient electrophoresis indicated that both protein preparations were homogeneous. Colicin E2, however, was shown to exist under certain conditions in two active, electrophoretically distinguishable forms, which were interconvertible. Biochemical analysis showed that both colicin E2 and colicin E3 are simple proteins composed exclusively of amino acids. Both proteins have sedimentation coefficients of 4.0 S and molecular weights of approximately 60,000. Amino acid and immunochemical analyses of colicins E2 and E3 suggest that there are regions of similar structure in the two proteins as well as regions unique to each protein. These observations are consistent with the specificity for the same receptor site, the differing modes of killing action, and the differing responses to immunity exhibited by these two colicins."

Dopa has been identified by several different comparisons with an authentic sample and by conversion to two derivatives. The amount of dopa in the tumor (4 to 8 µg per g) has been estimated by cofactor assay and fluorometry. A Km value for dopa as a cofactor was estimated to be about 2 x 10-6 m, much lower than its Km as a sole substrate (5 x 10-4 m)."
https://openalex.org/W1503370943,"Abstract Tyrosine aminotransferase was highly purified from rat livers in which the enzyme had been induced by a glucocorticoid hormone. The preparation eluted from a DEAE-cellulose column as a single peak gave a single precipitin line by the Ouchterlony double diffusion precipitin reaction and sedimented as a single boundary in the ultracentrifuge with an s20,w of 5.9. A molecular weight of 91,000 was determined by equilibrium sedimentation. Despite these indications of homogeneity, three enzymatically active bands were observed in disk-gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme is yellow in solution and exhibits absorption maxima at 425 mµ and 327 mµ (at slightly acidic pH), which indicate an interaction of the enzyme with its cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate. Addition of tyrosine shifted the 425 mµ peak to 327 mµ, whereas α-ketoglutarate, the keto-acid substrate, reversed this shift. Separation of enzyme from coenzyme could be achieved by dialyzing holoenzyme with tyrosine in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Addition of pyridoxal phosphate to apoenzyme caused return of the 425 mµ peak and full reconstitution of activity. One mole of pyridoxal phosphate is bound per 94,000 g of enzyme. Tyrosine aminotransferase has a bell-shaped pH-activity curve with a maximum near pH 7.5. The following apparent Michaelis constants were determined: tyrosine, 1.7 x 10-3 m, α-ketoglutarate, 7 x 10-4 m, pyridoxal phosphate, 1.7 x 10-8 m, and pyridoxamine phosphate, 1.5 x 10-7 m. Phosphate was shown to competitively inhibit the binding of the two cofactors to enzyme with Ki values of 1.1 x 10-3 m and 3.4 x 10-3 m for pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate, respectively."

In order to prolong the cultivation of plasmodial species in vitro1, we sought a supply of blood infected with Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Apart from nine cases of human malaria and two samples of frozen human infected blood, no steady supply for our experiments was available in the Bay area of California. Storing or freezing the blood causes the parasite to change before the experiments are begun."

The spermatogenic phase is associated with the seasonal acquisition of a secondary sexual characteristic which we have termed the ""fatted"" condition. Body weights, measurements of subcutaneous fat, and testicular histology studied over a 12-month period further establish this cycle. Climatological analyses suggest that this cycle is associated with the precipitation cycles of the respective environments."
https://openalex.org/W1605791091,"Abstract Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 1000-fold from a methotrexate-resistant subline of the L1210 lymphoma with 49% yield and purity up to 100%. The procedure involves ammonium sulfate and acid precipitation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite. Purity has been determined by titrating enzymic activity and protein fluorescence with a stoichiometric inhibitor, methotrexate, and confirmed by electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. The isoelectric point in phosphate buffer is approximately pH 6.0, but in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, the isoelectric point is above pH 8.5. The protein contains one reactive sulfhydryl group and is stabilized to heat and to urea denaturarion by each of its substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1585935445,"Abstract The chloramphenicol-inactivating enzyme in the multiple drug-resistant Escherichia coli carrying R factor produced two products from chloramphenicol in a cell-free system as well as in whole cells. Thin layer chromatography on silica gel, infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis were carried out with the products. These products were identified as d-thero-2-dichloroacetamido-1-(p-nitrophenyl)-1-hydroxy-3-acetoxypropane and d-threo-2-dichloroacetamido-1-(p-nitrophenyl)-1,3-diacetoxypropane. It was shown that a chloramphenicol-resistant E. coli B selected in vitro and a sensitive strain of E. coli K-12 have no capacity to produce acetyl derivatives of chloramphenicol. Studies of the substrate specificity, heat stability, pH optimum, and chromatographic behavior of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme from the multiple drug-resistant E. coli were carried out. The chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme from the multiple drug-resistant E. coli produces a 3-O-acetyl derivative of chloramphenicol and converts the former to a 1,3-O, O-diacetyl derivative. The enzyme which produces the monoacetyl derivative was purified 120-fold, while the enzyme which produces the diacetyl derivative from the monoacetyl derivative was purified about 50-fold by the same purification procedures. It was not possible to decide whether one or two enzymes participate in the acetylation of chloramphenicol. When the multiple drug-resistant E. coli cells were converted to spheroplasts by lysozyme and ethylenediaminetetraacetate, the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was not released into the medium under conditions in which the bulk of ribonuclease was released but β-galactosidase was not."

The pH optimum with sialyllactose as substrate is 4.4, and with glycoproteins is 4.0. The enzyme is not affected by many divalent metal ions, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, or p-chloromercuribenzoate, and is active against many glycoproteins and gangliosides, indicating its possible role in their intracellular digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1572651262,"Abstract Specific chemical modification studies were carried out in an attempt to characterize the of carbonic anhydrase with regard to its catalytic properties, the binding of inhibitors (anions and sulfonamides), and the binding and role of the zinc atom. Enzymatic activity was determined by catalytic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. The CO2-hydrating activity was also determined in some experiments, and it paralleled the activity determined from the esterase assays. Amidination of all the lysyl residues of the enzyme with methyl acetimidate hydrochloride caused no loss of activity. Hence, a lysine residue is not involved in any critical function at the active site. Bromoacetate and iodoacetamide both inactivate the enzyme by reaction at the 3'-imidazole nitrogen of a histidine residue. By measuring enzymatic activity immediately after addition of these reagents, both were found to be reversible inhibitors of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the rate of inactivation is directly proportional to the fraction of the enzyme which is reversibly inhibited by these reagents. Other inhibitors, chloride and sulfanilamide, compete with the binding of iodoacetamide and competitively protect the enzyme against inactivation. The histidine (or histidines) must be located near the inhibitor-binding site and react with these reagents while they are bound there. The zinc atom may be removed from the native enzyme and replaced by cobalt to regenerate an active enzyme (Co(II)-enzyme). Inactivation of Co(II)-enzyme is similar to that of the native enzyme. The rate of inactivation of the apoenzyme (as measured in terms of activity after adding back zinc or cobalt) by iodoacetamide is about the same as with native or Co(II)-enzyme, but the rate with bromoacetate is only 1 to 2% of its rate with native or Co(II)-enzyme. In addition, chloride does not protect the apoenzyme against inactivation by iodoacetamide. Hence, the metal atom seems to be involved in the binding of anionic inhibitors. Inactivation by these reagents is incomplete, and evidence is presented which suggests that the residual activity is a function of the modified enzyme. The residual activity after reaction of the native enzyme with iodoacetamide is about 16% of that of the native enzyme at pH 7.4. After reaction with bromoacetate, it amounts to about 4% at pH 7.5 and 15% at pH 9.6. Chloroacetamide also acts as a reversible inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, but it does not inactivate the enzyme. 2,4-Dinitrofluorobenzene does not appear to be a reversible inhibitor, but it can inactivate the native, apo-, and Co(II)-enzymes by reacting only with 1 to 2 residues of histidine. A strong sulfonamide inhibitor, acetazolamide, does not completely protect against inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1481052299,"Abstract All of the cysteic acid residues (4.6 per subunit) found by amino acid analysis of performic acid-oxidized Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase are present as cysteine in the native enzyme but are buried in the interior of the molecule. They become exposed and accessible to titration by sulfhydryl reagents only when the enzyme is disaggregated into subunits or when divalent cation is removed with ethylenediaminetetraacetate. From the total number of peptides and the number of arginine-containing and 14C-carboxymethylated peptides that are produced upon tryptic digestion of 14C-carboxymethylated glutamine synthetase, it is suggested that the enzyme is composed of identical subunits. However, until an explanation is found for the wide variation in the observed specific radioactivity of the 14C-carboxymethylated peptides thus obtained, this conclusion is still uncertain. Glutamine synthetase can be inactivated by organic mercurials, and the extent of inactivation depends upon the amount of divalent cation in association with the enzyme. Two states of the enzyme are thus defined: relaxed enzyme, without metal, which is susceptible to inactivation and disaggregation by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, and taut enzyme, which has bound manganese and is resistant to such treatment. The metabolic effectors of glutamine synthetase may cause alterations in the rate and extent of inactivation of the enzyme by mercurials. Of the inhibitors that are partially competitive with respect to glutamate, tryptophan diminishes the inactivation by mercurials, cytidine triphosphate enhances this inactivation, and glycine has little effect. Of the compounds that are partially competitive inhibitors with respect to ammonia, histidine is protective against inactivation and glucosamine-6-P has no effect. Similarly, with the noncompetitive inhibitors, AMP decreases the rate of inactivation while carbamyl phosphate and alanine have no influence. These results provide additional support for the occurrence in glutamine synthetase of separate binding sites for each inhibitor, as would be expected from the independent nature of the cumulative feedback inhibition phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1488862879,"Abstract Lipopolysaccharide prepared from the cell wall of Azotobacter vinelandii was found to consist of two polydisperse components: s20 = 8 to 16 S and s20 = 70 to 100 S. Treatment of this material with ethylenediaminetetraacetate resulted in dissociation into a smaller homogeneous unit with a molecular weight of 134,000 daltons. Subsequent dialysis in the presence of CaCl2 produced a reassociated polymer with a molecular weight of 873,000 daltons. Dissociation of the lipopolysaccharide was also effected by dodecyl sulfate. The smallest subunit, obtained by the combined action of dodecyl sulfate and ethylenediaminetetraacetate, had a molecular weight of 65,600 daltons when corrected for binding of dodecyl sulfate. Equilibrium and velocity sedimentation and viscosity measurements characterize both the dissociated and reassociated species as relatively homogeneous, highly asymmetric particles. The hydrogen ion titration curve has clearly identifiable segments due to the titration of carboxyl and amino groups. The latter appear to have a lower intrinsic pK than expected from the partially known structure. The lipopolysaccharide was shown to contain phosphate, glucose, and a 2-keto-3-deoxy sugar. Ribose, rhamnose, and hexosamine were identified tentatively."

https://openalex.org/W1518753085,"2,4-Dinitrophenol fails to stimulate the breakdown of the soluble high energy intermediate of oxidative phosphorylation isolated from Alcaligenes faecalis extracts. Once the intermediate is broken down, by other reactions, the coupling enzyme is prevented from reassociation with the electron transport particles by 2,4-dinitrophenol. Phosphorylating particles washed with 2,4-dinitrophenol lose coupling enzyme and with it the ability to form the energy-rich intermediate and to couple phosphorylation to electron transport. Phosphorylating particles containing bound coupling enzyme are able to form the high energy intermediate even in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol. However, after this first cycle of formation, no more can be formed because 2,4-dinitrophenol prevents the reassociation of coupling enzyme with the electron transport particles. 2,4-Dinitrophenol stimulates respiration in the bacterial phosphorylating particles."

https://openalex.org/W1540782861,"Abstract The physical and enzymatic properties of prephenate dehydratase from three regulatory mutants and the wild type of Bacillus subtilis are compared. The mutants were selected on the basis of their resistance to growth inhibition by the phenylalanine analogue β-thienylalanine. The three mutant enzymes either are resistant to feedback inhibition and are inherently more active than the enzyme from the parent strain or are capable of being activated by l-phenylalanine, the feedback inhibitor of the wild type enzyme. We have termed the gene modification giving rise to these end product-activated mutants regulation reversal mutation. The wild type enzyme is protected from heat and storage inactivation by its inhibitor, phenylalanine. In the presence of phenylalanine the enzyme gives substrate saturation curves which are not strictly first order. The Km for barium prephenate is ≅5 x 10-3 m. A molecular weight of approximately 65,000 was determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The prephenate dehydratase from mutant WB740 is resistant to phenylalanine inhibition, is protected from heat denaturation by the substrate barium prephenate but not by phenylalanine, and shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics in substrate saturation curves. The Km for barium prephenate is 8.3 x 10-4 m. The molecular weight is approximately 190,000, roughly 3 times the value obtained for the wild type enzyme. A second thienylalanine-resistant mutant, WB2136, has two readily separable species of prephenate dehydratase which differ from each other in several characteristics. One species resembles the enzyme from WB740 in molecular weight (approximately 190,000) and heat stability characteristics. However, unlike WB740, it is extremely labile when stored at 0° in the absence of phenylalanine. Substrate saturation curves reveal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km for barium prephenate is 2.3 x 10-3 m. The second species resembles the wild type enzyme in molecular weight (approximately 65,000) and heat stability characteristics. This species gives sigmoid substrate saturation curves. Although interconversion of the two enzymes could not be demonstrated in vitro, conversion in vivo very likely occurs, since the mutation to end product activation is expressed in both enzyme species. A third thienylalanine-resistant mutant, WB2155, has a single species of prephenate dehydratase, which is capable of being activated by phenylalanine. The molecular weight of this enzyme is approximately 65,000, the same as the wild type enzyme and the light enzyme of WB2136. Substrate saturation curves (determined in the presence of the activator) were nearly identical with those observed for the light enzyme of WB2136. The enzyme is not protected from heat inactivation by either phenylalanine or barium prephenate. The sites concerned with analogue resistance in all three mutants map within, or extremely close to, the structural gene for prephenate dehydratase."

https://openalex.org/W1971696514,"SINCE the work of Earl and Thompson1,2 on hens, and the brief note by Mendel and Rudney3 on rats, it has often been accepted4,5 that in tri-ortho cresyl phosphate (TOCP) intoxication, pseudocholinesterase is markedly inhibited but that there is little or no decrease in true cholinesterase. A decrease in red blood cell cholinesterase has, however, been reported in rabbits6 and a slight fall in man7 after treatment with TOCP by mouth, and Taylor8 has commented on parasympathomimetic effects in cats injected with this compound. I have investigated changes in cholinesterase in baboons after oral doses of TOCP. Monkeys have been found to be very resistant to TOCP by mouth9,10 and it has been suggested the monkeys do not absorb it from the gut. In addition to pure TOCP therefore a 10 per cent emulsion in 10 per cent ’Tween 80‘ has also been tried in the present work at the suggestion of Dr J. D. Taylor of the Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta. He has found this emulsion more active than the pure substance (personal communication from J. D. Taylor). The results to be described show that after administration of either preparation to the baboon, pseudocholinesterase is very readily inhibited, but that marked inhibition of true cholinesterase also occurs. In the reports of TOCP poisoning in man after accidental ingestion, diarrhoea and abdominal pain have often been noted and have sometimes been severe11. These effects would be expected to accompany inhibition of true cholinesterase."
