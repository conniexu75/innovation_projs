https://openalex.org/W1866589985,"The size and spatial distribution of pits on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, which are active and probably created by a sinkhole process, imply that large heterogeneities exist in the physical, structural or compositional properties of the first few hundred metres below the current cometary surface. Using data from the OSIRIS camera onboard ESA's Rosetta probe, Jean-Baptiste Vincent et al. have been able to examine cometary pits — a surface feature detected on many cometary nuclei — with unprecedented spatial resolution and with varying viewing geometries. The pits on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko are shown to be active and probably created by a sinkhole process. The authors propose that after formation, the pits expand slowly in diameter with sublimation-driven retreat of the walls. The size and spatial distribution of pits implies large heterogeneities in physical, structural or compositional properties of the first few hundred metres below the current surface. Pits have been observed on many cometary nuclei mapped by spacecraft1,2,3,4. It has been argued that cometary pits are a signature of endogenic activity, rather than impact craters such as those on planetary and asteroid surfaces. Impact experiments5,6 and models7,8 cannot reproduce the shapes of most of the observed cometary pits, and the predicted collision rates imply that few of the pits are related to impacts8,9. Alternative mechanisms like explosive activity10 have been suggested, but the driving process remains unknown. Here we report that pits on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko are active, and probably created by a sinkhole process, possibly accompanied by outbursts. We argue that after formation, pits expand slowly in diameter, owing to sublimation-driven retreat of the walls. Therefore, pits characterize how eroded the surface is: a fresh cometary surface will have a ragged structure with many pits, while an evolved surface will look smoother. The size and spatial distribution of pits imply that large heterogeneities exist in the physical, structural or compositional properties of the first few hundred metres below the current nucleus surface."

This study provides information on current antibiotic use in freshwater aquaculture, as well as on resulting antibiotic concentrations in the aquatic environment of the Mekong Delta. Two major production steps, fish hatcheries and mature fish cultivation, were surveyed (50 fish farm interviews) for antibiotic use. Different water sources, including surface water, groundwater and piped water (164 water samples) were systematically screened for antibiotic residues. To better understand antibiotic fate under tropical conditions, the dissipation behavior of selected antibiotics in the aquatic environment was investigated for the first time in mesocosm experiments. None of the investigated antibiotics were detected in groundwater and piped water samples. Surface water, which is still often used for drinking and domestic purposes by local populations, contained median concentrations of 21 ng L-1 sulfamethoxazole (SMX), 4 ng L-1 sulfadiazine (SDZ), 17 ng L-1 trimethoprim (TRIM), and 12 ng L-1 enrofloxacin (ENRO). These concentrations were lower than the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), suggesting limited antibiotic-related risk to aquatic ecosystems in the monitored systems. The dissipation half-lives of the studied antibiotics ranged from <1 to 44 days, depending on the availability of sunlight and sediment. Among the studied antibiotics TRIM was the most persistent in water systems. TRIM was not susceptible to photodegradation, while the dissipation of ENRO and SDZ was influenced by photolysis. The recorded dissipation models gave good predictions of the occurrence and concentrations of TRIM, ENRO and SDZ in surface water. In summary, the currently measured concentrations of the investigated antibiotics are unlikely to cause immediate risks to the aquatic environment, yet the persistence of these antibiotics is of concern and might lead to chronic exposure of aquatic organisms as well as humans."
https://openalex.org/W835695194,"Exotic Xylosandrus spp. ambrosia beetles established in non-native habitats have been associated with sudden and extensive attacks on a diverse range of living trees, but factors driving their shift from dying/dead hosts to living and healthy ones are not well understood. We sought to characterize the role of host physiological condition on preference and colonization by two invaders, Xylosandrus germanus and Xylosandrus crassiusculus. When given free-choice under field conditions among flooded and non-flooded deciduous tree species of varying intolerance to flooding, beetles attacked flood-intolerant tree species over more tolerant species within 3 days of initiating flood stress. In particular, flood-intolerant flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) sustained more attacks than flood-tolerant species, including silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor). Ethanol, a key host-derived attractant, was detected at higher concentrations 3 days after initiating flooding within stems of flood intolerant species compared to tolerant and non-flooded species. A positive correlation was also detected between ethanol concentrations in stem tissue and cumulative ambrosia beetle attacks. When adult X. germanus and X. crassiusculus were confined with no-choice to stems of flood-stressed and non-flooded C. florida, more ejected sawdust resulting from tunneling activity was associated with the flood-stressed trees. Furthermore, living foundresses, eggs, larvae, and pupae were only detected within galleries created in stems of flood-stressed trees. Despite a capability to attack diverse tree genera, X. germanus and X. crassiusculus efficiently distinguished among varying host qualities and preferentially targeted trees based on their intolerance of flood stress. Non-flooded trees were not preferred or successfully colonized. This study demonstrates the host-selection strategy exhibited by X. germanus and X. crassiusculus in non-native habitats involves detection of stress-induced ethanol emission and early colonization of living but weakened trees."
https://openalex.org/W2163049411,"Massive galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, turbulent and magnetized intra-cluster medium. Still forming under the action of gravitational instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks, while residual transonic (near-sonic) flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades. Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium and also amplifies magnetic energy by way of dynamo action. However, the pattern regulating the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation. The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of self-similarity in cosmology, while its structure, consistent with current data, encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action."
https://openalex.org/W801834163,"Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors in adults and exhibit a spectrum of aberrantly aggressive phenotype. Although increasing evidence indicated that the deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to tumorigenesis and invasion, little is known about the roles of miR-204-5p in human gliomas. In the present study, the expression of miR-204-5p in clinical glioma tissues was measured by qRT-PCR. The effects of miR-204-5p on glioma cell growth and metastasis were examined by overexpressing or inhibiting miR-204-5p. We found that the expression level of miR-204-5p was significantly reduced in clinical glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues. Moreover, we revealed that the introduction of miR-204-5p dramatically suppressed glioma cell growth, migration and invasion. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations revealed that RAB22A, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is a direct functional target of miR-204-5p in gliomas. In vivo, restoring miR-204-5p expression in glioma cells suppressed tumorigenesis and increased overall host survival. Our findings suggest that miR-204-5p is a cancer suppressor miRNA and overexpression of miR-204-5p is a novel glioma treatment strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1601223168,"Fatty acids are among the least understood nutrients in marine environments, despite their profile as key energy components of food webs and that they are essential to all life forms. Presented here is a novel approach to predict the spatial-temporal distributions of fatty acids in marine resources using generalized additive mixed models. Fatty acid tracers (FAT) of key primary producers, nutritional condition indices and concentrations of two essential long-chain (≥C20) omega-3 fatty acids (EFA) measured in muscle of albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga, sampled in the south-west Pacific Ocean were response variables. Predictive variables were: location, time, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chla), and phytoplankton biomass at time of catch and curved fork length. The best model fit for all fatty acid parameters included fish length and SST. The first oceanographic contour maps of EFA and FAT (FATscapes) were produced and demonstrated clear geographical gradients in the study region. Predicted changes in all fatty acid parameters reflected shifts in the size-structure of dominant primary producers. Model projections show that the supply and availability of EFA are likely to be negatively affected by increases in SST especially in temperate waters where a 12% reduction in both total fatty acid content and EFA proportions are predicted. Such changes will have large implications for the availability of energy and associated health benefits to high-order consumers. Results convey new concerns on impacts of projected climate change on fish-derived EFA in marine systems."
https://openalex.org/W2223235680,"The immune suppressive protein CTLA-4 is constitutively expressed by Tregs and induced in effector T cells upon activation. Its crucial role in adaptive immunity is apparent from the fatal autoimmune pathology seen in CTLA-4 knockout mice. However, little is known regarding factors that regulate CTLA-4 expression and their effect upon its function to remove CD80 and CD86 from antigen presenting cells by transendocytosis. Th17 cells are emerging as significant players in autoimmunity as well as other diseases. Therefore, in this study we have examined the effects of Th17 polarising conditions on CTLA-4 expression and function in human T cells and show that Th17 conditions can suppress the expression of CTLA-4 and its transendocytic function. In contrast to Th17 cells, vitamin D is inversely associated with autoimmune disease. We have previously shown a striking ability of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) to enhance CTLA-4, however, its effects upon B7 transendocytosis and its activity in the context of inflammation remained unknown. Here we show that induction of CTLA-4 by 1,25(OH)2D3 can actually be enhanced in the presence of Th17 polarising cytokines. Furthermore, its transendocytic function was maintained such that T cells generated in the presence of Th17 conditions and 1,25(OH)2D3 were highly effective at capturing CTLA-4 ligands from antigen presenting cells and suppressing T cell division. Taken together, these data reveal an inhibitory effect of Th17 polarising conditions upon CTLA-4-mediated regulation and show that 1,25(OH)2D3 counteracts this effect. Given the importance of CTLA-4-mediated suppression in the control of autoimmune diseases, our novel data highlight the importance of vitamin D in inflammatory settings."
https://openalex.org/W1810338061,"In many Gram-positive bacteria PerR is a major peroxide sensor whose repressor activity is dependent on a bound metal cofactor. The prototype for PerR sensors, the Bacillus subtilis PerRBS protein, represses target genes when bound to either Mn2+ or Fe2+ as corepressor, but only the Fe2+-bound form responds to H2O2. The orthologous protein in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, PerRSA, plays important roles in H2O2 resistance and virulence. However, PerRSA is reported to only respond to Mn2+ as corepressor, which suggests that it might rely on a distinct, iron-independent mechanism for H2O2 sensing. Here we demonstrate that PerRSA uses either Fe2+ or Mn2+ as corepressor, and that, like PerRBS, the Fe2+-bound form of PerRSA senses physiological levels of H2O2 by iron-mediated histidine oxidation. Moreover, we show that PerRSA is poised to sense very low levels of endogenous H2O2, which normally cannot be sensed by B. subtilis PerRBS. This hypersensitivity of PerRSA accounts for the apparent lack of Fe2+-dependent repressor activity and consequent Mn2+-specific repressor activity under aerobic conditions. We also provide evidence that the activity of PerRSA is directly correlated with virulence, whereas it is inversely correlated with H2O2 resistance, suggesting that PerRSA may be an attractive target for the control of S. aureus pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2067882959,"A wide investigation was conducted into the main organic matter (OM) sources supporting coral reef trophic networks in the lagoon of New Caledonia. Sampling included different reef locations (fringing, intermediate and barrier reef), different associated ecosystems (mangroves and seagrass beds) and rivers. In total, 30 taxa of macrophytes, plus pools of particulate and sedimentary OM (POM and SOM) were sampled. Isotopic signatures (C and N) of each OM sources was characterized and the composition of OM pools assessed. In addition, spatial and seasonal variations of reef OM sources were examined. Mangroves isotopic signatures were the most C-depleted (-30.17 ± 0.41 ‰) and seagrass signatures were the most C-enriched (-4.36 ± 0.72 ‰). Trichodesmium spp. had the most N-depleted signatures (-0.14 ± 0.03 ‰) whereas mangroves had the most N-enriched signatures (6.47 ± 0.41 ‰). The composition of POM and SOM varied along a coast-to-barrier reef gradient. River POM and marine POM contributed equally to coastal POM, whereas marine POM represented 90% of the POM on barrier reefs, compared to 10% river POM. The relative importance of river POM, marine POM and mangroves to the SOM pool decreased from fringing to barrier reefs. Conversely, the relative importance of seagrass, Trichodesmium spp. and macroalgae increased along this gradient. Overall, spatial fluctuations in POM and SOM were much greater than in primary producers. Seasonal fluctuations were low for all OM sources. Our results demonstrated that a large variety of OM sources sustain coral reefs, varying in their origin, composition and role and suggest that δ13C was a more useful fingerprint than δ15N in this endeavour. This study also suggested substantial OM exchanges and trophic connections between coral reefs and surrounding ecosystems. Finally, the importance of accounting for environmental characteristics at small temporal and spatial scales before drawing general patterns is highlighted."
https://openalex.org/W1502432507,"Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by loss of the SMN1 gene and retention of SMN2. The SMN2 copy number inversely correlates with phenotypic severity and is a modifier of disease outcome. The SMN2 gene essentially differs from SMN1 by a single nucleotide in exon 7 that modulates the incorporation of exon 7 into the final SMN transcript. The majority of the SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 and this leads to a SMN protein that does not effectively oligomerize and is rapidly degraded. However the SMN2 gene does produce some full-length SMN and the SMN2 copy number along with how much full-length SMN the SMN2 gene makes correlates with severity of the SMA phenotype. However there are a number of discordant SMA siblings that have identical haplotypes and SMN2 copy number yet one has a milder form of SMA. It has been suggested that Plastin3 (PLS3) acts as a sex specific phenotypic modifier where increased expression of PLS3 modifies the SMA phenotype in females. To test the effect of PLS3 overexpression we have over expressed full-length PLS3 in SMA mice. To ensure no disruption of functionality or post-translational processing of PLS3 we did not place a tag on the protein. PLS3 protein was expressed under the Prion promoter as we have shown previously that SMN expression under this promoter can rescue SMA mice. High levels of PLS3 mRNA were expressed in motor neurons along with an increased level of PLS3 protein in total spinal cord, yet there was no significant beneficial effect on the phenotype of SMA mice. Specifically, neither survival nor the fundamental electrophysiological aspects of the neuromuscular junction were improved upon overexpression of PLS3 in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2157904085,"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an endogenous ligand of G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120). However, the mechanisms underlying DHA action are poorly understood. In this study, DHA stimulated glucose uptake in the skeletal muscles in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. GPR120-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ was critical for DHA-mediated AMPK phosphorylation and glucose uptake. In addition, DHA stimulated GLUT4 translocation AMPK-dependently. Inhibition of AMPK and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase blocked DHA-induced glucose uptake. DHA and GW9508, a GPR120 agonist, increased GPR120 expression. DHA-mediated glucose uptake was not observed in GPR120 knockdown conditions. DHA increased AMPK phosphorylation, glucose uptake, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration in primary cultured myoblasts. Taken together, these results indicated that the beneficial metabolic role of DHA was attributed to its ability to regulate glucose via the GPR120-mediated AMPK pathway in the skeletal muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1664863192,"The human DNA glycosylase NEIL1 was recently demonstrated to initiate prereplicative base excision repair (BER) of oxidized bases in the replicating genome, thus preventing mutagenic replication. A significant fraction of NEIL1 in cells is present in large cellular complexes containing DNA replication and other repair proteins, as shown by gel filtration. However, how the interaction of NEIL1 affects its recruitment to the replication site for prereplicative repair was not investigated. Here, we show that NEIL1 binarily interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp loader replication factor C, DNA polymerase δ, and DNA ligase I in the absence of DNA via its non-conserved C-terminal domain (CTD); replication factor C interaction results in ∼8-fold stimulation of NEIL1 activity. Disruption of NEIL1 interactions within the BERosome complex, as observed for a NEIL1 deletion mutant (N311) lacking the CTD, not only inhibits complete BER in vitro but also prevents its chromatin association and reduced recruitment at replication foci in S phase cells. This suggests that the interaction of NEIL1 with replication and other BER proteins is required for efficient repair of the replicating genome. Consistently, the CTD polypeptide acts as a dominant negative inhibitor during in vitro repair, and its ectopic expression sensitizes human cells to reactive oxygen species. We conclude that multiple interactions among BER proteins lead to large complexes, which are critical for efficient BER in mammalian cells, and the CTD interaction could be targeted for enhancing drug/radiation sensitivity of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1780665720,"Efficient apoptosis requires Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which releases death-promoting proteins cytochrome c and Smac to the cytosol, which activate apoptosis and inhibit X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) suppression of executioner caspases, respectively. We recently identified that in response to Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins and mitochondrial depolarization, XIAP can permeabilize and enter mitochondria. Consequently, XIAP E3 ligase activity recruits endolysosomes into mitochondria, resulting in Smac degradation. Here, we explored mitochondrial XIAP action within the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that mitochondrial XIAP entry requires Bax or Bak and is antagonized by pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins. Moreover, intramitochondrial Smac degradation by XIAP occurs independently of Drp1-regulated cytochrome c release. Importantly, mitochondrial XIAP actions are activated cell-intrinsically by typical apoptosis inducers TNF and staurosporine, and XIAP overexpression reduces the lag time between the administration of an apoptotic stimuli and the onset of mitochondrial permeabilization. To elucidate the role of mitochondrial XIAP action during apoptosis, we integrated our findings within a mathematical model of intrinsic apoptosis signaling. Simulations suggest that moderate increases of XIAP, combined with mitochondrial XIAP preconditioning, would reduce MOMP signaling. To test this scenario, we pre-activated XIAP at mitochondria via mitochondrial depolarization or by artificially targeting XIAP to the intermembrane space. Both approaches resulted in suppression of TNF-mediated caspase activation. Taken together, we propose that XIAP enters mitochondria through a novel mode of mitochondrial permeabilization and through Smac degradation can compete with canonical MOMP to act as an anti-apoptotic tuning mechanism, reducing the mitochondrial contribution to the cellular apoptosis capacity.

In addition, XIAP participates in the upstream and downstream regulation of MOMP, distinct from its direct caspase delay and suppression functions.

Following MOMP, XIAP has been proposed to directly bind to Smac inside mitochondria and impede its release (14Flanagan L. Sebastià J. Tuffy L.P. Spring A. Lichawska A. Devocelle M. Prehn J.H. Rehm M.

We recently reported that BH3-only protein expression or chemical mitochondrial uncoupling triggered rapid XIAP-mediated MOMP and concomitant XIAP entry into inner mitochondrial compartments (16Hamacher-Brady A. Choe S.C. Krijnse-Locker J. Brady N.R.

The action of XIAP at mitochondria was characterized by ubiquitylation of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and inner mitochondrial compartments and by recruitment of endolysosomal machinery into mitochondria, independently of mitophagy. Importantly, intramitochondrial XIAP induced the degradation of its inhibitor Smac, whereas cytochrome c release was only partially activated, thus suggesting a novel anti-apoptotic role for mitochondrial XIAP. Here, we elucidated function and regulation of mitochondrial XIAP action within the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. We demonstrate that XIAP entry into mitochondria is mediated by Bax and Bak and antagonized by pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, we show that mitochondrial XIAP action prominently occurs in response to drug-induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis and phenotypically results in a reduced pre-MOMP delay, the lag time between the administration of an apoptotic stimulus and the onset of mitochondrial permeabilization. Importantly, we show that XIAP entry and subsequent intramitochondrial targeting of Smac are distinct from Drp1-regulated cytochrome c release during canonical MOMP. To determine whether XIAP action at mitochondria can protect against drug-induced apoptosis, we explored XIAP action at mitochondria versus direct caspase suppression activities using a systems biology approach. Combined mathematical modeling and experimental approaches revealed conditions whereby XIAP suppression of mitochondrial Smac significantly cooperates with downstream XIAP inhibition of caspases. Based on these findings, we propose that following apoptosis induction XIAP-induced membrane permeabilization 1) is mechanistically and functionally distinct from canonical, pro-apoptotic MOMP, and 2) under increased XIAP levels functions as an anti-apoptotic tuning mechanism capable of reducing the mitochondrial apoptosis capacity via intramitochondrial Smac degradation.

Human MCF7 breast cancer (CLS Cell Line Service) and HeLa Kyoto cervical cancer cell lines were maintained in DMEM (1 g/liter d-glucose, 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate) and embryonic kidney 293T cells in DMEM (4.5 g/liter d-glucose), supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. Bax/Bak double-knock out (ATCC® CRL-2913TM) and WT SV40 (ATCC® CRL-2907TM) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing l-glutamine and HEPES and supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. Transient transfections were performed using JetPRIME transfection reagent (Peqlab), and experiments were performed following 24 h of expression, unless stated otherwise. For stable lentiviral gene transfer, pCDH-puro-CMV carrying the super-folding GFP-tagged caspase-3/-7 sensor (GC3A1) (19Zhang J. Wang X. Cui W. Wang W. Zhang H. Liu L. Zhang Z. Li Z. Ying G. Zhang N.

MCF7 cells were infected with virus particle-containing supernatants and selected and maintained with puromycin (1 μg/ml), following selection of a stable single clone line. For experiments, cells were plated in puromycin-free medium. Treatments with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; 20 μm; Merck Millipore), TNF (43 ng/ml; a kind gift of BASF, Mannheim, Germany), actinomycin D (AcD; 1 μg/ml; Calbiochem), and staurosporine (STS, 1 μm; Calbiochem) were performed in fully supplemented cell culture medium (FM) or in glucose-containing Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.; catalog no. 14025), as indicated. Cells plated in 8-well microscopy μ-slides (ibidi) were transfected and/or subjected to the indicated drug treatments. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS, pH 7.4). For immunostaining, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 3% BSA. Then the cells were incubated with primary antibodies against Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. sc-493), cytochrome c (BD Biosciences; catalog no. 556432), Smac/DIABLO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. sc-22766), Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. sc-11415 or catalog no. sc-17764), TRAP1 (Novus Biologicals; catalog no. NB300-555), Lys-63 linkage-specific polyubiquitin (Merck Millipore; catalog no. 05-1308), or XIAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. sc-55551) at room temperature for 1 h. Fluorescent staining was performed for 30 min at room temperature using highly cross-adsorbed Alexa Fluor 350, 488, 546, or 647 secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.). A DeltaVision RT microscope system (Applied Precision) equipped with a ×60 oil immersion objective was employed for wide field fluorescence microscopy. Images of representative cells were captured using the z axis scan function or, when indicated, as z stacks with 0.15-μm step sizes. Acquired images were deconvolved (SoftWoRx, Applied Precision). Image analysis and preparation were performed using ImageJ (rsbweb.nih.gov). Representative images shown are total intensity projections (z axis scans) or maximal intensity projections (z stacks). Inverted grayscale was chosen for displaying single color channels for optimal detail visibility. In merged color images, pseudocolors correspond to font colors of protein labels within single color images. Immunofluorescence detection of endogenous proteins is indicated within single color images by “IF,” to discriminate from detection of fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. Images were acquired with identical exposure settings using the z axis scan function to capture total cellular fluorescence within a single image. The number of analyzed fields of view is indicated in plots. Identical cytosolic areas within treated cells were analyzed. Per cell, cytosolic regions were measured for integrated cytochrome c or Smac immunofluorescence intensity as a measure of protein level, and standard deviation of fluorescence signal, as a measure of mitochondrial cytochrome c/Smac content. Per condition and per image, we calculated the ratio of cytochrome c/Smac levels and standard deviations in cells expressing XIAP cells versus cytochrome c/Smac levels and standard deviations in nontransfected cells. Cells within at least four fields of view were analyzed per condition, each from at least three independent experiments. RFP-XIAP was expressed for 24 h in MCF7 cells, fixed, and immunostained for XIAP. Overexpression of XIAP was calculated from the immunofluorescence levels of transfected versus nontransfected cells. Identical cytosolic areas within control and treated cells were analyzed for GFP fluorescence. The impact of expressed proteins on GFP fluorescence was calculated for each image, based on relative changes ((transfected − nontransfected fluorescence)/nontransfected fluorescence). The fold change induced by CCCP or TNF/AcD, relative to control FM, is reported. Cells within at least four fields of view were analyzed per condition, from each of at least three independent experiments. At 24 h of expression of RFP or RFP-XIAP, MCF7 cells were treated for 3 h with STS or TNF, fixed, and immunostained for Smac. The numbers of RFP- or RFP-XIAP-positive cells with mitochondrial Smac, and with loss of mitochondrial Smac, were scored. At least six fields of view were analyzed per condition, from four independent experiments. MCF7 whole cell lysates were prepared with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Dosed samples were electrophoresed using BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using the iBlot dry blotting system (Invitrogen). Immunodetection was performed using antibodies against β-actin (GeneTex; catalog no. GTX26276), cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling; catalog no. 5625), cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. sc-131566), GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. sc-25778), GFP (Chromotek; catalog no. 3H9), and Smac (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. sc-22766). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for digital chemiluminescence detection. Blots shown are representative of three independent experiments. The probability of statistically significant increases or decreases between conditions of at least three independent experiments was determined using Student's t test. Two-tailed, unpaired t tests were performed for imaging experiments; one-tailed, unpaired t test was performed for Western blot analysis. Bar graphs represent values as mean ± S.D. Box plots show individual data points and median values, and whiskers indicate range of data points. Scatter plots show individual data points and the linear fit, and the shaded area indicates confidence intervals. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant changes (p < 0.05). Deterministic simulations of the SMBL file “BIOMD0000000220” from Albeck et al. (11Albeck J.G. Burke J.M. Aldridge B.B. Zhang M. Lauffenburger D.A. Sorger P.K. Quantitative analysis of pathways controlling extrinsic apoptosis in single cells.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 11-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) were performed using Copasi software (20Hoops S. Sahle S. Gauges R. Lee C. Pahle J. Simus N. Singhal M. Xu L. Mendes P. Kummer U. COPASI–a COmplex PAthway SImulator.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3067-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Simulations were run with a 50% decrease to initial Smac concentrations and with a 3-fold increase of initial XIAP concentrations. Relative PARP cleavage is plotted over time. We recently showed that in response to BH3-only protein expression, XIAP E3 ligase activity leads to prominent mitochondrial ubiquitylation, associated with entry of XIAP and endolysosomal machinery into inner mitochondrial compartments, independently of mitophagy and Parkin (16Hamacher-Brady A. Choe S.C. Krijnse-Locker J. Brady N.R.

We further showed that in cells transiently overexpressing XIAP, mitochondrial uncoupling with CCCP is sufficient for induction of these events and triggers Bax translocation to and clustering at the OMM. Here, to determine whether Bax is required for XIAP entry into mitochondria, we examined pathway activation in Bax/Bak double-knock out (DKO) and control SV40 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (3Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Treatment with CCCP (20 μm) for 3 h failed to induce translocation of GFP-XIAP to mitochondria in Bax/Bak DKO MEFs (Fig. 1A). In control MEFs, CCCP induced Bax cluster formation at and RFP-XIAP entry into mitochondria of all XIAP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Bax and/or Bak are necessary components of XIAP entry. We therefore reconstituted Bax in DKO MEFs. Indeed, following CCCP treatment, all cells that co-expressed RFP-XIAP displayed GFP-Bax clustering and RFP-XIAP entry into mitochondria (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that Bax reconstitution is sufficient to re-establish pathway activation. Note, in a subset of cells, RFP-XIAP and GFP-Bax localized to mitochondria even in the absence of CCCP, indicating that Bax overexpression alone can be sufficient to activate mitochondrial XIAP entry (data not shown). We next examined whether, similar to Bax, the OMM-residing Bak (4Shamas-Din A. Brahmbhatt H. Leber B. Andrews D.W. BH3-only proteins: orchestrators of apoptosis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1813: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) is activated during XIAP entry into mitochondria. Under normal growth conditions RFP-Bak, co-expressed with GFP-XIAP in MCF7 cells, localized to elongated mitochondria in the majority of cells homogeneously distributed at the OMM (data not shown). In response to 3-h CCCP treatment, RFP-Bak formed clusters at fragmented mitochondria that contained GFP-XIAP (Fig. 1D). To test whether, in the absence of Bax, Bak was sufficient to mediate XIAP entry into mitochondria, we co-expressed RFP-Bak with GFP-XIAP in Bax/Bak DKO MEFs. In response to 3-h CCCP, Bak formed clusters at the OMM and, similar to Bax reconstitution, alone permitted mitochondrial XIAP localization. Given the obligatory role for the presence of either Bax or Bak in XIAP entry into mitochondria, we speculated that inhibition of Bax/Bak via pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins (22Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. BCL-2 family members and the mitochondria in apoptosis.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar, 23Youle R.J. Strasser A. The BCL-2 protein family: opposing activities that mediate cell death.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar) would block the CCCP-induced XIAP action at mitochondria. Indeed, CCCP treatment of Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells did not trigger mitochondrial translocation of XIAP (Fig. 1E). Moreover, Bcl-xL overexpression prevented mitochondrial Smac degradation (Fig. 1, E and F), a hallmark consequence of CCCP treatment in combination with XIAP overexpression (16Hamacher-Brady A. Choe S.C. Krijnse-Locker J. Brady N.R.

In contrast, the Bcl-xL(G138E/R139L/I140N) mutant that does not bind Bax or Bak (24Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Bax-independent inhibition of apoptosis by Bcl-XL.Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) did not inhibit XIAP entry into mitochondria or degradation of Smac (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating that Bcl-xL blockage of mitochondrial XIAP action is dependent on its inhibition of Bax/Bak. Similarly, wild type GFP-Bcl-2 suppressed XIAP targeting of mitochondria, whereas the GFP-Bcl-2(G145A) mutant with impaired binding to Bax (25Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. BH1 and BH2 domains of Bcl-2 are required for inhibition of apoptosis and heterodimerization with Bax.Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) and Bak (26Kawatani M. Imoto M. Deletion of the BH1 domain of Bcl-2 accelerates apoptosis by acting in a dominant negative fashion.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19732-19742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) permitted CCCP-induced mitochondrial entry of XIAP (results not shown) and Smac degradation (Fig. 1F). Taken together, Bax/Bak-mediated XIAP-induced MOMP permits XIAP entry into depolarized mitochondria and, similar to canonical MOMP, is suppressed by pro-survival Bcl-2 signaling. In response to the overexpression of BH3-only proteins BimEL, tBid, Bik, and Bad, endogenous XIAP levels are sufficient to induce ubiquitylation and endolysosomal targeting of mitochondria (16Hamacher-Brady A. Choe S.C. Krijnse-Locker J. Brady N.R.

We therefore speculated that the mitochondrial XIAP pathway might be endogenously engaged during drug-induced apoptosis. Wild type MCF7 cells were treated with the intrinsic apoptosis inducer STS or the death receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor (TNF), both of which trigger activation of endogenous Bid (27Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cleavage of BID during cytotoxic drug and UV radiation-induced apoptosis occurs downstream of the point of Bcl-2 action and is catalysed by caspase-3: a potential feedback loop for amplification of apoptosis-associated mitochondrial cytochrome c release.Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 28Li H.

Cleavage of BID by caspase 8 mediates the mitochondrial damage in the Fas pathway of apoptosis.Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). Indeed, at 6 h of treatment, both STS- and TNF-treated cells exhibited the characteristic phenotypes of XIAP-mediated mitochondrial processing (16Hamacher-Brady A. Choe S.C. Krijnse-Locker J.

Moreover, Smac protein levels were markedly reduced in cells treated with staurosporine for 6 h, while cytochrome c levels were less impacted (Fig. 2C). Because a hallmark of the combination of CCCP treatment and XIAP overexpression is the rapid activation of MOMP, as indicated by Bax (16Hamacher-Brady A. Choe S.C. Krijnse-Locker J. Brady N.R.

https://openalex.org/W1477783513,"Background and Aim Prognostic markers are important for predicting the progression and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ezrin (EZR) and Podocalyxin (PODXL) are proteins associated with invasion, migration and poor prognosis in various types of cancer. Recently, it has been observed that chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) forms a complex with EZR and PODXL and that it is required for podocyte structure and function. In this study, we evaluated the overexpression of EZR, PODXL and CLIC5 in HCC. Methods The modified resistant hepatocyte model (MRHR), human biopsies and HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh7 and SNU387) were used in this study. Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated in the MRHR by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses, and protein expression in the human biopsies was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Protein expression in the HCC cell lines was evaluated by immunofluorescence and Western blot, also the migration and invasive abilities of Huh7 cells were evaluated using shRNA-mediated inhibition. Results Our results indicated that these genes and proteins were overexpressed in HCC. Moreover, when the expression of CLIC5 and PODXL was inhibited in Huh7 cells, we observed decreased migration and invasion. Conclusion This study suggested that EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL could be biological markers to predict the prognosis of HCC and that these proteins participate in migration and invasion processes."
https://openalex.org/W785245612,"Preeclampsia is characterized by reduced placental perfusion with placental ischemia and hypertension during pregnancy. Preeclamptic women also exhibit a heightened inflammatory state and greater number of neutrophils in the vasculature compared to normal pregnancy. Since neutrophils are associated with tissue injury and inflammation, we hypothesized that neutrophils are critical to placental ischemia-induced hypertension and fetal demise. Using the reduced uteroplacental perfusion pressure (RUPP) model of placental ischemia-induced hypertension in the rat, we determined the effect of neutrophil depletion on blood pressure and fetal resorptions. Neutrophils were depleted with repeated injections of polyclonal rabbit anti-rat polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) antibody (antiPMN). Rats received either antiPMN or normal rabbit serum (Control) on 13.5, 15.5, 17.5, and 18.5 days post conception (dpc). On 14.5 dpc, rats underwent either Sham surgery or clip placement on ovarian arteries and abdominal aorta to reduce uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP). On 18.5 dpc, carotid arterial catheters were placed and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured on 19.5 dpc. Neutrophil-depleted rats had reduced circulating neutrophils from 14.5 to 19.5 dpc compared to Control, as well as decreased neutrophils in lung and placenta on 19.5 dpc. MAP increased in RUPP Control vs Sham Control rats, and neutrophil depletion attenuated this increase in MAP in RUPP rats without any effect on Sham rats. The RUPP-induced increase in fetal resorptions and complement activation product C3a were not affected by neutrophil depletion. Thus, these data are the first to indicate that neutrophils play an important role in RUPP hypertension and that cells of the innate immune system may significantly contribute to pregnancy-induced hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2152562360,"Human ovulation is not advertised, as it is in several primate species, by conspicuous sexual swellings. However, there is increasing evidence that the attractiveness of women's body odor, voice, and facial appearance peak during the fertile phase of their ovulatory cycle. Cycle effects on facial attractiveness may be underpinned by changes in facial skin color, but it is not clear if skin color varies cyclically in humans or if any changes are detectable. To test these questions we photographed women daily for at least one cycle. Changes in facial skin redness and luminance were then quantified by mapping the digital images to human long, medium, and shortwave visual receptors. We find cyclic variation in skin redness, but not luminance. Redness decreases rapidly after menstrual onset, increases in the days before ovulation, and remains high through the luteal phase. However, we also show that this variation is unlikely to be detectable by the human visual system. We conclude that changes in skin color are not responsible for the effects of the ovulatory cycle on women's attractiveness."

Notably, this incision defect of R237C and G241R was observed on a pre-assembled DNA glycosylase·AP-DNA complex as well.

By analyzing the metabolic incorporation of azidohomoalanine, a methionine analogue, in newly synthesized proteins, we find that glutamate treatments up-regulate protein translation not only in intact rat cortical neurons in culture but also in the axons emitting from cortical neurons before making synapses with target cells. The process by which glutamate stimulates local translation in axons begins with the binding of glutamate to the ionotropic AMPA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 and members of group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors on the plasma membrane. Subsequently, the activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and the rise in Ca2+, resulting from Ca2+ influxes through calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and transient receptor potential canonical channels, in axons stimulate the local translation machinery. For comparison, the enhancement effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on the local protein synthesis in cortical axons were also studied. The results indicate that Ca2+ influxes via transient receptor potential canonical channels and activated the mTOR pathway in axons also mediate BDNF stimulation to local protein synthesis. However, glutamate- and BDNF-induced enhancements of translation in axons exhibit different kinetics. Moreover, Ca2+ and mTOR signaling appear to play roles carrying different weights, respectively, in transducing glutamate- and BDNF-induced enhancements of axonal translation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of allergies to milk, egg, cod, and wheat using reported data, clinical examinations, and double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges, and to describe the phenotypes of reported food hypersensitivity in a cohort of Swedish schoolchildren.In a population-based cohort of 12-year-old children, the parents of 2612 (96% of invited) completed a questionnaire. Specific IgE antibodies to foods were analyzed in a random sample (n=695). Children reporting complete avoidance of milk, egg, cod, or wheat due to perceived hypersensitivity and without physician-diagnosed celiac disease were invited to undergo clinical examination that included specific IgE testing, a celiac screening test, and categorization into phenotypes of food hypersensitivity according to preset criteria. Children with possible food allergy were further evaluated with double-blind challenges.In this cohort, the prevalence of reported food allergy to milk, egg, cod, or wheat was 4.8%. Food allergy was diagnosed in 1.4% of the children after clinical evaluation and in 0.6% following double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge. After clinical examination, children who completely avoided one or more essential foods due to perceived food hypersensitivity were categorized with the following phenotypes: allergy (29%), outgrown allergy (19%), lactose intolerance (40%), and unclear (12%).There was a high discrepancy in the prevalence of allergy to milk, egg, cod and wheat as assessed by reported data, clinical evaluation, and double-blind food challenges.

The SMFs were used to train two decoders to infer the timing and types of movement by support vector machine and Gaussian process regression. The SMFs were also used to calculate estimated slow cortical potentials (eSCPs) to identify the origin of motor information. Finally, using the trained decoders, the subjects controlled a neuroprosthetic hand in a closed-loop condition.The SMFs in the open-loop condition revealed movement-related cortical field characteristics and successfully inferred the movement type with an accuracy of 75.0 ± 12.9% (mean ± SD). In particular, the eSCPs in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the moved hand varied significantly enough among the movement types to be decoded with an accuracy of 76.5 ± 10.6%, which was significantly higher than the accuracy associated with eSCPs in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex (58.1 ± 13.7%; p = 0.0072, paired two-tailed Student's t-test). Moreover, another decoder using SMFs successfully inferred when the accuracy was the greatest. Combining these two decoders allowed the neuroprosthetic hand to be controlled in a closed-loop condition.Use of real-time MEG signals was shown to successfully control the neuroprosthetic hand. The developed system may be useful for evaluating movement-related slow cortical potentials of severely paralyzed patients to predict the efficacy of invasive BMI."
https://openalex.org/W1779873354,"Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a multisubunit, membrane-bound enzyme of the respiratory chain. The energy from NADH oxidation in the peripheral region of the enzyme is used to drive proton translocation across the membrane. One of the integral membrane subunits, nuoL in Escherichia coli, has an unusual lateral helix of ∼75 residues that lies parallel to the membrane surface and has been proposed to play a mechanical role as a piston during proton translocation (Efremov, R. G., Baradaran, R., and Sazanov, L. A. (2010) Nature 465, 441–445). To test this hypothesis we have introduced 11 pairs of cysteine residues into Complex I; in each pair one is in the lateral helix, and the other is in a nearby region of subunit N, M, or L. The double mutants were treated with Cu2+ ions or with bi-functional methanethiosulfonate reagents to catalyze cross-link formation in membrane vesicles. The yields of cross-linked products were typically 50–90%, as judged by immunoblotting, but in no case did the activity of Complex I decrease by >10–20%, as indicated by deamino-NADH oxidase activity or rates of proton translocation. In contrast, several pairs of cysteine residues introduced at other interfaces of N:M and M:L subunits led to significant loss of activity, in particular, in the region of residue Glu-144 of subunit M. The results do not support the hypothesis that the lateral helix of subunit L functions like a piston, but rather, they suggest that conformational changes might be transmitted more directly through the functional residues of the proton translocation apparatus."

In this study, we sought to explore the mechanism whereby rebamipide could promote the regeneration of aspirin-induced intestinal mucosal damage.BALB/c mice were administered aspirin (200 mg/kg/d) for 5 days to induce acute small intestinal injury (SII). Subsequently, SII mice were treated with rebamipide (320 mg/kg/d) for 5 days. The structure of intestinal barrier was observed with transmission electron microscope, and Zo-1 and occludin expressions were detected. The proliferative index was indicated by the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells. The prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in the small intestine tissues were measured by an enzyme immunoassay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX) and β-catenin signal were detected in the small intestine using quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively.COX expression was significantly down-regulated in aspirin induced SII (P < 0.05). In SII mice treated with rebamipide, histopathological findings of aspirin-induced intestinal inflammation were significantly milder and tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells were improved significantly. The proliferative index increased after rebamipide treatment when compared with that in the control mice. The expressions of COX-2, β-catenin, and c-myc and the PGE2 concentrations in small intestinal tissues were significantly increased in mice with rebamipide treatments (P < 0.05).Rebamipide administration in aspirin-induced SII mice could improve the intestinal barrier structure and promote the regeneration of small intestinal epithelial injury through up-regulating COX-2 expression and the accumulation of β-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W852069368,"Aim Despite the impact of spasticity, there is a lack of objective, clinically reliable and valid tools for its assessment. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of various performance- and spasticity-related parameters collected with a manually controlled instrumented spasticity assessment in four lower limb muscles in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Method The lateral gastrocnemius, medial hamstrings, rectus femoris and hip adductors of 12 children with spastic CP (12.8 years, ±4.13 years, bilateral/unilateral involvement n=7/5) were passively stretched in the sagittal plane at incremental velocities. Muscle activity, joint motion, and torque were synchronously recorded using electromyography, inertial sensors, and a force/torque load-cell. Reliability was assessed on three levels: (1) intra- and (2) inter-rater within session, and (3) intra-rater between session. Results Parameters were found to be reliable in all three analyses, with 90% containing intra-class correlation coefficients >0.6, and 70% of standard error of measurement values <20% of the mean values. The most reliable analysis was intra-rater within session, followed by intra-rater between session, and then inter-rater within session. The Adds evaluation had a slightly lower level of reliability than that of the other muscles. Conclusions Limited intrinsic/extrinsic errors were introduced by repeated stretch repetitions. The parameters were more reliable when the same rater, rather than different raters performed the evaluation. Standardisation and training should be further improved to reduce extrinsic error when different raters perform the measurement. Errors were also muscle specific, or related to the measurement set-up. They need to be accounted for, in particular when assessing pre-post interventions or longitudinal follow-up. The parameters of the instrumented spasticity assessment demonstrate a wide range of applications for both research and clinical environments in the quantification of spasticity."

We utilized fluorescence polarization measurements and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to define molecular interactions between the specific human isoforms hsp90β and apo-sGCβ1. hsp90β and its isolated M domain, but not its isolated N and C domains, bind with low micromolar affinity to a heme-free, truncated version of sGCβ1 (sGCβ1(1–359)-H105F).

In its active form, sGC is a heterodimer composed of similar α and β subunits, but only the β subunit contains a binding site for heme (25Derbyshire E.R.

In recent studies, we found that hsp90 specifically associates with the heme-free form of the sGCβ1 subunit (apo-sGCβ1) in cells (27Ghosh A. Stuehr D.J. Soluble guanylyl cyclase requires heat shock protein 90 for heme insertion during maturation of the NO-active enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Moreover, we found that hsp90 promotes heme insertion into apo-sGCβ1 in an ATP-dependent process. hsp90 subsequently dissociates from heme-loaded sGCβ1, which concurrently associates with an sGCα1 partner subunit to form the mature sGC heterodimer (27Ghosh A. Stuehr D.J. Soluble guanylyl cyclase requires heat shock protein 90 for heme insertion during maturation of the NO-active enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Only heme-containing sGCβ1 can form heterodimers that bind and respond to nitric oxide (NO), the native sGC-activating molecule in signaling cascades (29Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E. Chaudhuri G. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor produced and released from artery and vein is nitric oxide.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 9265-9269Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of the molecular details of the hsp90-sGCβ1 interaction is needed to understand hsp90's role in sGC maturation. To address this, we utilized fluorescence polarization measurements and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HxDMS) to characterize the interaction between hsp90β1 and apo-sGCβ1, representative isoforms of the two proteins. We determined that hsp90β interacts not with the heme-binding H-NOX domain of heme-free sGCβ1 but rather with the adjacent Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, also termed the H-NOXA (H-NOX-associated) domain. We found that the M domain of hsp90β primarily mediates this interaction; moreover, we identified specific regions on the hsp90β M domain and sGCβ1 PAS domain that participate in or respond to the interaction. Our findings (i) provide unifying concepts regarding hsp90 interactions with PAS domain client proteins and (ii) suggest a possible mechanism whereby hsp90β anchors apo-sGCβ1 through its PAS domain for heme insertion during client maturation. Dr. Tomasz Religa (Case Western Reserve University) kindly provided pet15MHL plasmids containing the coding sequences of full-length human hsp90β or the hsp90β N domain (residues 1–227) and a pet28MHL plasmid encoding the hsp90β M domain (residues 284–543). These constructs add a TEV-cleavable hexa-histidine tag at the N or C termini of the respective constructs. We cloned the human hsp90β C domain (residues 621–724) into pGEX-4T1 plasmid to generate a construct with an N-terminal thrombin-cleavable GST tag. All constructs were sequenced for verification. Plasmids coding for full-length hsp90β, the N domain, or the M domain were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-codon+. Overnight cultures grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth (LB) were used to inoculate 2 liters of Terrific broth. Expression cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.8–1.0, induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and shaken for 20 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and all subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protease inhibitor mixture (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), and lysozyme and disrupted by sonication on ice. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation and applied onto a gravity column of 20 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with PBS. The resin was washed with 100 ml of PBS followed by 100 ml of PBS + 80 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with 75 ml of PBS + 200 mm imidazole and concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Concentrated protein was dialyzed into PBS + 1 mm DTT, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. The hsp90β C domain was expressed in E. coli BL21. Cells were grown, induced, and processed as described above. Clarified cell lysate was bound to 10–40 ml of 50% glutathione-Sepharose-4B in PBS. The resin was washed five times in 30 ml of PBS per wash, and bound protein was eluted with 20 ml of fresh 10 mm glutathione, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. This solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed twice in 1 liter of PBS + 1 mm DTT. GST-free hsp90β C domain was prepared by incubating the sample with 10 units of thrombin/mg of protein for several hours at room temperature, followed by tumbling for 30 min with 10–40 ml of 50% GST-Sepharose-4B resin, centrifugation (250 rpm for 5 min), and collection of the supernatant. The resin was washed three times with 20 ml of PBS to recover the remaining C domain, and this solution was combined with the supernatant for concentration, flash-freezing, and storage at −70 °C. sGCβ1 constructs were obtained from pET21 expression plasmids containing bovine sGCβ1(1–197) (the heme-binding H-NOX domain) or sGCβ1(1–359) (H-NOX domain, PAS domain, and N-terminal portion of the coiled-coil domain), which were described previously (30Purohit R.

A H105F substitution was introduced into sGCβ1(1–359) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). A construct of the sGCβ1 PAS domain (residues 202–342) plusa C-terminal TEV cleavage site was generated from the sGCβ1(1–359) DNA by PCR and subcloned into a pET20b+ plasmid, adding a C-terminal hexa-histidine affinity tag. Plasmids coding for sGCβ1(1–197), sGCβ1(1–359), sGCβ1(1–359)-H105F, or sGCβ1-PAS were transformed into BL21Codon+ cells. Overnight cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth and used to inoculate 2-liter expression cultures grown in Terrific broth. Expression cultures were grown until the A600 = 2.0–3.0 and subsequently cold-shocked for 1 h in an ice bath. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 20 h at 25 °C at 250 rpm. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors, benzonase, and lysozyme. Resuspended cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. The sGCβ1(1–197), sGCβ1(1–359), and sGCβ1(1–359)-H105F proteins were purified by anion exchange chromatography on a 25-ml Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A, and the sGCβ1 protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 50 mm to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing sGCβ1 protein were pooled, concentrated to 2 ml, and dialyzed into buffer A. The Q-Sepharose purification was then repeated using buffers adjusted to pH 8.5, and fractions containing the sGCβ1 proteins were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. The sGCβ1-PAS construct was purified on a gravity column containing 20 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The resin was washed with 100 ml of buffer A and 100 ml of buffer A + 40 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with 50 ml of buffer A + 160 mm imidazole and concentrated to 2 ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Concentrated protein was dialyzed into buffer A + 1 mm DTT, and the His6 tag was removed by incubation with 1000 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. To remove uncut protein, the TEV digest was redialyzed twice into buffer A (without DTT) and applied to a gravity column containing 5 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resin pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The flow-through was retained, and 20 ml of buffer A + 10 mm imidazole was used to elute residual sGCβ1-PAS from the beads. Residual sGCβ1-PAS was combined with the original flow-through, concentrated to 2 ml, dialyzed against buffer A + 1 mm DTT, and flash-frozen and stored at −70 °C. Protein molecular weight estimations were performed using a gel filtration column and protein standards. For labeling, selected proteins were dialyzed into 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.3. FITC, dissolved in the bicarbonate buffer, was added to the proteins at a ratio of 20 μg of FITC to 1 mg of protein. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, the reaction mixture was passed through a PD-10 column to capture excess FITC and to exchange the protein sample into PBS buffer. FITC labeling efficiency was calculated based on 495 nm based on a FITC extinction coefficient of 63,000 m−1 cm−1 at 495 nm. FITC-labeled proteins were diluted in PBS in a fluorescence cuvette to a final concentration of 0.5 or 1 μm, and unlabeled prospective binding partners were titrated into the cuvette. The excitation wavelength was 495 nm, and the emission was monitored at 520 nm. The fluorescence intensity was recorded multiple times after each addition, with polarization filters set in the parallel and perpendicular positions, and then used to calculate the average polarized parallel intensity (I1) and average polarized perpendicular intensity (I2). The fluorescence polarization at each titration point was calculated by the formula: (I1 − I2)/(I1 + I2). In addition, selected titrations were performed in triplicate using 0.2 μm FITC-labeled sGCβ1(1–359)-H105F or sGCβ1-PAS in 100-μl volumes in a 96-well plate, using a Flexstation 3 multimode microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The resulting binding curves were fit in Origin Lab 8.0 (Origin Lab Corp.) to calculate binding affinities. In some cases, the Flexstation titrations also included 1 mm ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP. All titration experiments were repeated independently 2 or 3 times. hsp90β M domain (8 μg) or sGCβ1(1–359)-H105F (10 μg) in 100 μl of 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl was mixed with 10 μl of 1 mm HCl to lower the pH to 2.4. Samples were digested by incubation with 10 μg of porcine pepsin (1 mg/ml), dissolved in 0.05% TFA, for 5 min on ice. The final hsp90β M and sGCβ1(1–359)-H105F concentrations were 2 μm. The digested sample was injected into a micropeptide trap (Michrom Bioresources) connected to a C18 HPLC column (5 cm × 1 mm, Alltech) coupled to a ThermoElectron LTQ ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron). Peptic fragments were eluted using a gradient of acetonitrile (Burdick and Jackson) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for a tandem mass spectrometry experiment to sequence each of the peptic fragments. Peptic fragments were identified using the search algorithm SEQUEST (ThermoElectron) and by manual inspection. Purified hsp90β M domain and sGCβ1(1–359)-H105F were utilized singly or were incubated together (20 μm each) for 45 min at room temperature in 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl to form a complex. Each protein sample was rapidly diluted 10-fold with 40 mm EPPS buffer, pD 7.6, 150 mm NaCl dissolved in D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at 25 °C to initiate deuterium exchange. Reactions were quenched at different time points by addition of 1 mm HCl to lower the pH to 2.4, followed by quick-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath. Samples were stored at −80 °C before further analysis. Frozen hydrogen/deuterium exchange samples were quickly thawed and digested with 10 μg of pepsin (1 mg/ml, dissolved in 0.05% TFA, and H2O) for 5 min on ice immediately followed by injection into a micropeptide trap connected to a C18 HPLC column (5 cm ×1 mm, Alltech) coupled to a ThermoElectron LTQ ion-trap mass spectrometer. Peptic peptides were eluted in 15 min using a gradient of 5–45% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The micropeptide trap and C18 HPLC column were immersed in a water/ethanol bath at 0.2 °C during the entire run to minimize back exchange. Peaks were identified manually, and centroid masses were calculated using the software MagTran (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). A fully deuterated reference sample for each protein was used to correct for deuterium loss during sample handling. Deuterium incorporation for each peptide fragment was calculated and is presented as normalized percentage of deuterium uptake (% deuteration or % deuterium uptake) using Equation 1,%D = ((mt−m0%)/(m100%−m0%))×100(Eq. 1) where mt is the centroid mass of the deuterated peptic fragment at incubation time t, and m0% and m100% are the centroid masses of the unlabeled and fully deuterated peptic fragments, respectively. All deuterium uptake experiments were performed in triplicate for individual proteins and their complexes.

The I-tasser Z-scores of all domain models were greater than −0.25, indicating a high likelihood that the domains had correct folds and correct overall tertiary structure. We further estimated the accuracy of the individual domain models using ModEval (42Eramian D. Eswar N. Shen M.Y. Sali A.

https://openalex.org/W1561739195,"The aims of this study were, first, to examine the metabolic consequences for female rats of having unrestricted access to 10% sucrose solution and, second, to test for effects of this dietary intervention on their offspring. In Stage 1 females were mated following a 4-week period in which one group was given the sucrose in addition to their normal chow and a control group was given chow and water only. Sucrose was removed at parturition and the pups monitored until weaning. Despite the development of glucose intolerance in sucrose-fed mothers, no effects were detected on litter size or pup weights. In Stage 2 voluntary activity of offspring was assessed over postnatal days (PND) 51-60 and their glucose tolerance measured at PND89-94. Again no effect of maternal diet was detected. Only male offspring were used in Stage 3, which began when they were 13 weeks old. Four groups were given 10% sucrose solution for 48 days in a 2 x 2 design, in which one factor was maternal diet and the other was whether they were given 2-h access to an activity wheel on alternate days. Higher fasting glucose levels were found in offspring of sugar-fed mothers. Exercise increased insulin sensitivity in these rats but not in offspring of control mothers. Behavioural measures of memory in Stage 3 did not reveal any effects of maternal diet or exercise. Overall, this study suggested that, while providing 10% sucrose solution ad-libitum was sufficient to impair maternal metabolism, the impact of this dietary manipulation on offspring may be revealed only when the offspring's diet is similarly manipulated."

We hypothesized that heparin and protamine dosing based on individual titration curves would improve haemostasis in comparison to standard dosing.Sixty patients scheduled for first time elective coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery were included in a prospective randomized study. The patients were randomized to heparin and protamine dosing with Hepcon HMS Plus device or to standard weight and activated clotting time (ACT) based dosing. Blood samples were collected before and 10 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Primary endpoint was endogenous thrombin potential in plasma 2 hours after surgery as assessed by calibrated automated thrombography. Secondary endpoints included total heparin and protamine doses, whole blood clot formation (thromboelastometry) and post-operative bleeding volume and transfusions. Heparin effect was assessed by measuring anti-Xa activity.Endogenous thrombin potential and clot formation deteriorated in both groups after surgery without statistically significant intergroup difference. There were no significant differences between the groups in total heparin and protamine doses, heparin effect, or postoperative bleeding and transfusions at any time point. Significant inverse correlations between anti-Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were observed 10 min (r = -0.43, p = 0.001), 2 hours (r = -0.66, p<0.001) and 4 hours after surgery (r = -0.58, p<0.001).In conclusion, the results suggest that perioperative heparin and protamine dosing based on individual titration curves does not improve haemostasis after cardiac surgery.

We have reported previously that deficiency of response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice. This study was conducted to determine the role of RGC-32 in the regulation of hepatic steatosis. We observed that hepatic RGC-32 was induced dramatically by both HFD challenge and ethanol administration. RGC-32 knockout (RGC32−/−) mice were resistant to HFD- and ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis. The hepatic triglyceride content of RGC32−/− mice was decreased significantly compared with WT controls even under normal chow conditions. Moreover, RGC-32 deficiency decreased the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). RGC-32 deficiency also decreased SCD1 activity, as indicated by decreased desaturase indices of the liver and serum. Mechanistically, insulin and ethanol induced RGC-32 expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway, which, in turn, increased SCD1 expression in a SREBP-1c-dependent manner. RGC-32 also promoted SREBP-1c expression through activating liver X receptor. These results demonstrate that RGC-32 contributes to the development of hepatic steatosis by facilitating de novo lipogenesis through activating liver X receptor, leading to the induction of SREBP-1c and its target genes. Therefore, RGC-32 may be a potential novel drug target for the treatment of hepatic steatosis and its related diseases.

https://openalex.org/W820584768,"The mammalian neocortex has undergone repeated selection for increases and decreases in size and complexity, often over relatively short evolutionary time. But because probing developmental mechanisms across many species is experimentally unfeasible, it is unknown whether convergent morphologies in distantly related species are regulated by conserved developmental programs. In this work, we have taken advantage of the abundance of available mammalian genomes to find evidence of selection on genomic regions putatively regulating neurogenesis in large- versus small-brained species. Using published fetal human RNA-seq data, we show that the gene-neighborhood (i.e., microsynteny) of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) implicated in cortical development is differentially conserved in large-brained species, lending support to the hypothesis that lincRNAs regulating neurogenesis are selectively lost in small-brained species. We provide evidence that this is not a phenomenon attributable to lincRNA expressed in all tissue types and is therefore likely to represent an adaptive function in the evolution of neurogenesis. A strong correlation between transcription factor-adjacency and lincRNA sequence conservation reinforces this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W1958572105,"T lymphocytes from many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) express decreased levels of the T cell receptor (TCR)-associated CD3 zeta (ζ) signaling chain, a feature directly linked to their abnormal phenotype and function. Reduced mRNA expression partly due to defective alternative splicing, contributes to the reduced expression of CD3ζ chain. We previously identified by oligonucleotide pulldown and mass spectrometry approaches, the serine arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of CD3ζ mRNA. We showed that SRSF1 regulates alternative splicing of the 3'UTR of CD3ζ to promote expression of the normal full length 3`UTR over an unstable splice variant in human T cells. In this study we show that SRSF1 regulates transcriptional activation of CD3ζ. Specifically, overexpression and silencing of SRSF1 respectively increases and decreases CD3ζ total mRNA and protein expression in Jurkat and primary T cells. Using promoter-luciferase assays, we show that SRSF1 enhances transcriptional activity of the CD3ζ promoter in a dose dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that SRSF1 is recruited to the CD3ζ promoter. These results indicate that SRSF1 contributes to transcriptional activation of CD3ζ. Thus our study identifies a novel mechanism whereby SRSF1 regulates CD3ζ expression in human T cells and may contribute to the T cell defect in SLE."

In this study, we have now identified amino acid determinants required for PI(3)P binding within a region predicted to adopt a pleckstrin homology-like fold in the N terminus of RME-8. The ability of RME-8 to associate with PI(3)P and early endosomes is largely abolished when residues Lys17, Trp20, Tyr24, or Arg26 are mutated resulting in diffuse cytoplasmic localization of RME-8 while maintaining the ability to interact with Hsc70.

https://openalex.org/W1533404259,"Corneal endothelial cells (CECs) form a monolayer at the innermost face of the cornea and are the engine of corneal transparency. Nevertheless, they are a vulnerable population incapable of regeneration in humans, and their diseases are responsible for one third of corneal grafts performed worldwide. Donor corneas are stored in eye banks for security and quality controls, then delivered to surgeons. This period could allow specific interventions to modify the characteristics of CECs in order to increase their proliferative capacity, increase their resistance to apoptosis, or release immunosuppressive molecules. Delivery of molecules specifically into CECs during storage would therefore open up new therapeutic perspectives. For clinical applications, physical methods have a more favorable individual and general benefit/risk ratio than most biological vectors, but are often less efficient. The delivery of molecules into cells by carbon nanoparticles activated by femtosecond laser pulses is a promising recent technique developed on non-adherent cells. The nanoparticles are partly consummated by the reaction releasing CO and H2 gas bubbles responsible for the shockwave at the origin of cell transient permeation. Our aim was to develop an experimental setting to deliver a small molecule (calcein) into the monolayer of adherent CECs. We confirmed that increased laser fluence and time exposure increased uptake efficiency while keeping cell mortality below 5%. We optimized the area covered by the laser beam by using a motorized stage allowing homogeneous scanning of the cell culture surface using a spiral path. Calcein uptake reached median efficiency of 54.5% (range 50.3–57.3) of CECs with low mortality (0.5%, range (0.55–1.0)). After sorting by flow cytometry, CECs having uptaken calcein remained viable and presented normal morphological characteristics. Delivery of molecules into CECs by carbon nanoparticles activated by femtosecond laser could prove useful for future cell or tissue therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1755160840,"Adenosylcobalamin-dependent isomerases catalyze carbon skeleton rearrangements using radical chemistry. We have recently demonstrated that an isobutyryl-CoA mutase variant, IcmF, a member of this enzyme family that catalyzes the interconversion of isobutyryl-CoA and n-butyryl-CoA also catalyzes the interconversion between isovaleryl-CoA and pivalyl-CoA, albeit with low efficiency and high susceptibility to inactivation. Given the biotechnological potential of the isovaleryl-CoA/pivalyl-CoA mutase (PCM) reaction, we initially attempted to engineer IcmF to be a more proficient PCM by targeting two active site residues predicted based on sequence alignments and crystal structures, to be key to substrate selectivity. Of the eight mutants tested, the F598A mutation was the most robust, resulting in an ∼17-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the PCM activity and a concomitant ∼240-fold decrease in the isobutyryl-CoA mutase activity compared with wild-type IcmF. Hence, mutation of a single residue in IcmF tuned substrate specificity yielding an ∼4000-fold increase in the specificity for an unnatural substrate. However, the F598A mutant was even more susceptible to inactivation than wild-type IcmF. To circumvent this limitation, we used bioinformatics analysis to identify an authentic PCM in genomic databases. Cloning and expression of the putative AdoCbl-dependent PCM with an α2β2 heterotetrameric organization similar to that of isobutyryl-CoA mutase and a recently characterized archaeal methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, allowed demonstration of its robust PCM activity. To simplify kinetic analysis and handling, a variant PCM-F was generated in which the αβ subunits were fused into a single polypeptide via a short 11-amino acid linker. The fusion protein, PCM-F, retained high PCM activity and like PCM, was resistant to inactivation. Neither PCM nor PCM-F displayed detectable isobutyryl-CoA mutase activity, demonstrating that PCM represents a novel 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin-dependent acyl-CoA mutase. The newly discovered PCM and the derivative PCM-F, have potential applications in bioremediation of pivalic acid found in sludge, in stereospecific synthesis of C5 carboxylic acids and alcohols, and in the production of potential commodity and specialty chemicals. Adenosylcobalamin-dependent isomerases catalyze carbon skeleton rearrangements using radical chemistry. We have recently demonstrated that an isobutyryl-CoA mutase variant, IcmF, a member of this enzyme family that catalyzes the interconversion of isobutyryl-CoA and n-butyryl-CoA also catalyzes the interconversion between isovaleryl-CoA and pivalyl-CoA, albeit with low efficiency and high susceptibility to inactivation. Given the biotechnological potential of the isovaleryl-CoA/pivalyl-CoA mutase (PCM) reaction, we initially attempted to engineer IcmF to be a more proficient PCM by targeting two active site residues predicted based on sequence alignments and crystal structures, to be key to substrate selectivity. Of the eight mutants tested, the F598A mutation was the most robust, resulting in an ∼17-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the PCM activity and a concomitant ∼240-fold decrease in the isobutyryl-CoA mutase activity compared with wild-type IcmF. Hence, mutation of a single residue in IcmF tuned substrate specificity yielding an ∼4000-fold increase in the specificity for an unnatural substrate. However, the F598A mutant was even more susceptible to inactivation than wild-type IcmF. To circumvent this limitation, we used bioinformatics analysis to identify an authentic PCM in genomic databases.

https://openalex.org/W1842347710,"DNA processing protein A (DprA) plays a crucial role in the process of natural transformation. This is accomplished through binding and subsequent protection of incoming foreign DNA during the process of internalization. DprA along with Single stranded DNA binding protein A (SsbA) acts as an accessory factor for RecA mediated DNA strand exchange. H. pylori DprA (HpDprA) is divided into an N-terminal domain and a C- terminal domain. In the present study, individual domains of HpDprA have been characterized for their ability to bind single stranded (ssDNA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Oligomeric studies revealed that HpDprA possesses two sites for dimerization which enables HpDprA to form large and tightly packed complexes with ss and dsDNA. While the N-terminal domain was found to be sufficient for binding with ss or ds DNA, C-terminal domain has an important role in the assembly of poly-nucleoprotein complex. Using site directed mutagenesis approach, we show that a pocket comprising positively charged amino acids in the N-terminal domain has an important role in the binding of ss and dsDNA. Together, a functional cross talk between the two domains of HpDprA facilitating the binding and formation of higher order complex with DNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W849825250,"O-mannosylation, the addition of mannose to serine and threonine residues of secretory proteins, is a highly conserved post-translational modification found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Here, we report the functional and molecular characterization of the HpPMT4 gene encoding a protein O-mannosyltransferase in the thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, an emerging host for the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins. Compared to the deletion of HpPMT1, deletion of another major PMT gene, HpPMT4, resulted in more increased sensitivity to the antibiotic hygromycin B, caffeine, and osmotic stresses, but did not affect the thermotolerance of H. polymorpha. Notably, the deletion of HpPMT4 generated severe defects in glycosylation of the surface sensor proteins HpWsc1p and HpMid2p, with marginal effects on secreted glycoproteins such as chitinase and HpYps1p lacking a GPI anchor. However, despite the severely impaired mannosylation of surface sensor proteins in the Hppmt4∆ mutant, the phosphorylation of HpMpk1p and HpHog1p still showed a high increase upon treatment with cell wall disturbing agents or high concentrations of salts. The conditional Hppmt1pmt4∆ double mutant strains displayed severely impaired growth, enlarged cell size, and aberrant cell separation, implying that the loss of HpPMT4 function might be lethal to cells in the absence of HpPmt1p. Moreover, the HpPmt4 protein was found to form not only a homomeric complex but also a heteromeric complex with either HpPmt1p or HpPmt2p. Altogether, our results support the function of HpPmt4p as a key player in O-mannosylation of cell surface proteins and its participation in the formation of heterodimers with other PMT members, besides homodimer formation, in H. polymorpha."

https://openalex.org/W1872121276,"Background Access to prompt and effective treatment is the cornerstone for malaria control. Population Services International in collaboration with the Ministry of Health launched a malaria behaviour change communication intervention in Nyanza province, Kenya. The initiative aimed to improve: symptom recognition and prompt access to government health facilities for febrile children; effective treatment with the recommended first-line drug artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in public health facilities and adherence to the AL regimen. Methods Pre- and post-intervention cross-sectional household surveys were used to evaluate the impact of the intervention on prompt and correct use of AL for febrile children below five years of age. The primary outcome was the proportion of children below five years of age with fever in the last 14 days accessing AL within 48 hours of fever onset. Results There was an increase from 62.8% pre-intervention to 79.4% post-intervention (95% CI: 11.1, 22.1) in caregivers who reported seeking formal treatment promptly (on the same day, or next day) for their febrile children. However, there was a decrease in the use of government health facilities in the post-intervention period. There was a small increase in the proportion of children accessing AL within 48 hours of fever onset [18.4% vs 23.5% (0.1–10.0)]. Conclusion The findings of this evaluation demonstrate that interventions that target only one sector may have a limited impact on improvements in prompt and effective treatment where multiple sources of treatments are sought for febrile illness. Additionally, the context in which an intervention is implemented is likely to influence the process and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W829625669,"The Palaearctic gall-midge genus Ozirhincus is unique among the Cecidomyiidae for its morphology and biology. Unlike most other phytophagous gall midges, species in this genus do not induce galls but develop inside achenes of Asteraceae plants. The heads of adults are characterized by an unusually elongate proboscis, the function of which is unclear. Despite a lot of attention from taxonomists in the 19th and early 20th century, a proper revision of the genus has been hindered by complex host associations, the loss of most relevant type material, and the lack of a thorough comparative study of all life stages. The present revision integrated morphological, molecular, and life-history data to clearly define species boundaries within Ozirhincus, and delimit host-plant ranges for each of them. A phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial COI and 16S genes confirmed the validity of four distinct species but did not resolve the relationships among them. All species are oligophages, and some may occur together on the same host plant. Species with wider host-plant ranges have wider European and circum-Mediterranean distribution ranges, whereas species with narrower host ranges are limited to Europe and the Russian Far East. As part of the present work, O. hungaricus is reinstated from synonymy, O. tanaceti is synonymized under O. longicollis, neotypes are designated for O. longicollis and O. millefolii, and a lectotype is designated for O. anthemidis."

The MCSP problem is closely related to genome comparison and rearrangement, an important field in Computational Biology. In this paper, we map the MCSP problem into a graph applying a prior technique and using this graph, we develop an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the problem. We implement the ILP formulation and compare the results with the state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The experimental results are found to be promising."
https://openalex.org/W2128304063,"Ikaros DNA binding factor plays critical roles in lymphocyte development. Changes in Ikaros expression levels during lymphopoiesis are controlled by redundant but also unique regulatory elements of its locus that are critical for this developmental process. We have recently shown that Ikaros binds its own locus in thymocytes in vivo. Here, we evaluated the role of an Ikaros binding site within its major lympho-myeloid promoter. We identified an Ikaros/Ets binding site within a promoter sub-region that was highly conserved in mouse and human. Deletion of this binding site increased the percentage of the reporter-expressing mouse lines, indicating that its loss provided a more permissive chromatin environment. However, once transcription was established, the lack of this site decreased transcriptional activity. These findings implicate a dual role for Ikaros/Ets1 binding on Ikzf1 expression that is exerted at least through its promoter."
https://openalex.org/W810520609,"Since the domestication of the urus, 10.000 years ago, mankind utilizes bovine milk for different purposes. Besides usage as a nutrient also the external application of milk on skin has a long tradition going back to at least the ancient Aegypt with Cleopatra VII as a great exponent. In order to test whether milk has impact on skin physiology, cultures of human skin fibroblasts were exposed to commercial bovine milk. Our data show significant induction of proliferation by milk (max. 2,3-fold, EC50: 2,5% milk) without toxic effects. Surprisingly, bovine milk was identified as strong inducer of collagen 1A1 synthesis at both, the protein (4-fold, EC50: 0,09% milk) and promoter level. Regarding the underlying molecular pathways, we show functional activation of STAT6 in a p44/42 and p38-dependent manner. More upstream, we identified IGF-1 and insulin as key factors responsible for milk-induced collagen synthesis. These findings show that bovine milk contains bioactive molecules that act on human skin cells. Therefore, it is tempting to test the herein introduced concept in treatment of atrophic skin conditions induced e.g. by UV light or corticosteroids."
https://openalex.org/W1491311259,"The discovery of effective therapies and of disease mechanisms underlying valosin containing protein (VCP)-associated myopathies and neurodegenerative disorders remains elusive. VCP disease, caused by mutations in the VCP gene, are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders with manifestations varying from hereditary inclusion body myopathy, Paget’s disease of bone, frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the present study, we examined the effects of higher dietary lipid percentages on VCPR155H/R155H, VCPR155H/+ and Wild Type (WT) mice from birth until 15 months of age by immunohistochemical and biochemical assays. Findings illustrated improvement in the muscle strength, histology, and autophagy signaling pathway in the heterozygote mice when fed 9% lipid-enriched diets (LED). However, increasing the LED by 12%, 30%, and 48% showed no improvement in homozygote and heterozygote survival, muscle pathology, lipid accumulation or the autophagy cascade. These findings suggest that a balanced lipid supplementation may have a therapeutic strategy for patients with VCP-associated multisystem proteinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W834645422,"A new relative of the chrysophyte genus Chrysopodocystis was found in Tenerife and termed Guanchochroma wildpretii. This unicellular alga was most noticeably discernible from Chrysopodocystis socialis (the only species of this genus) by the presence of a cyst-like stage with a multilayered lorica, which also functions as a dispersal unit and shows secondary wall growth. Secondary expansion of loricae (cell casings not involved in cell division, usually with a more or less pronounced opening) has never been observed previously and marks a unique feature of the new taxon. Plastids are non-randomly distributed within cells of G. wildpretii. 18S rRNA gene analyses identified the two species as sister lineages and placed them in a monophyletic group with the Synchromophyceae, a heterokont algal (Ochrophyta) class characterized by the presence of chloroplast complexes. Yet, neither Chrysopodocystis nor Guanchochroma showed this feature in ultrastructure analyses. Additionally, their 18S rRNA genes possessed distinct inserts, the highest GC-content known for Ochrophyta and exceptionally long branches on the Ochrophyta 18S rDNA phylogenetic tree, suggesting substantially increased substitution rates along their branch compared to Synchromophyceae. Plastid marker data (rbcL) recovered a monophyletic clade of Chrysopodocystis, Guanchochroma and Synchromophyceae as well, yet with lower supports for internal split order due to limited resolution of the marker. Evidence for the sequence of events leading to the formation of the plastid complex of Synchromophyceae still remains ambiguous because of the apparently short timeframe in which they occurred."
https://openalex.org/W751105311,"Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) is a statistical method that allows the researcher to identify and quantify a social influence on the spread of behaviour through a population. Hitherto, NBDA analyses have not directly modelled spatial population structure. Here we present a spatial extension of NBDA, applicable to diffusion data where the spatial locations of individuals in the population, or of their home bases or nest sites, are available. The method is based on the estimation of inter-individual associations (for association matrix construction) from the mean inter-point distances as represented on a spatial point pattern of individuals, nests or home bases. We illustrate the method using a simulated dataset, and show how environmental covariates (such as that obtained from a satellite image, or from direct observations in the study area) can also be included in the analysis. The analysis is conducted in a Bayesian framework, which has the advantage that prior knowledge of the rate at which the individuals acquire a given task can be incorporated into the analysis. This method is especially valuable for studies for which detailed spatially structured data, but no other association data, is available. Technological advances are making the collection of such data in the wild more feasible: for example, bio-logging facilitates the collection of a wide range of variables from animal populations in the wild. We provide an R package, spatialnbda, which is hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). This package facilitates the construction of association matrices with the spatial x and y coordinates as the input arguments, and spatial NBDA analyses."

https://openalex.org/W824974682,"The organization of cortical networks can be investigated functionally in brain slices. Laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) with glutamate-uncaging allows for a rapid survey of all connections impinging on single cells recorded in patch-clamp. We sought to develop a variant of the method that would allow for a more exhaustive mapping of neuronal networks at every experiment. We found that the extracellular field recordings could be used to detect synaptic responses evoked by LSPS. One to two electrodes were placed in all six cortical layers of barrel cortex successively and maps were computed from the size of synaptic negative local field potentials. The field maps displayed a laminar organization similar to the one observed in maps computed from excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded in patch-clamp mode. Thus, LSPS combined with field recording is an interesting alternative to obtain for every animal tested a comprehensive map of the excitatory intracortical network."
