https://openalex.org/W2083457841,"Exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations in a sample of more than 70 primary human colonic tumours were analysed in an attempt to characterize the genomic landscape; in addition to finding alterations in genes associated with commonly mutated signalling pathways, recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members were also found to occur in approximately 10% of colonic tumours, revealing a potential new therapeutic target. An analysis of exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations in more than 70 primary human colon tumours and matched normal controls has identified more than 35,000 protein-altering somatic mutations, most of which have been validated. In addition to alterations in genes involved in the Wnt pathway, chromatin remodelling and receptor-tyrosine-kinase signalling, the authors identify recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members that collectively occur in 10% of colon tumors; as such they may provide a potential therapeutic target. There is evidence to suggest that these fusions may have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Identifying and understanding changes in cancer genomes is essential for the development of targeted therapeutics1. Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10% of colon tumours. The RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer."

Here we find that the related RNF43 and ZNRF3 transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases are uniquely expressed in LGR5+ stem cells. Simultaneous deletion of the two genes encoding these proteins in the intestinal epithelium of mice induces rapidly growing adenomas containing high numbers of Paneth and LGR5+ stem cells. In vitro, growth of organoids derived from these adenomas is arrested when Wnt secretion is inhibited, indicating a dependence of the adenoma stem cells on Wnt produced by adenoma Paneth cells. In the HEK293T human cancer cell line, expression of RNF43 blocks Wnt responses and targets surface-expressed frizzled receptors to lysosomes. In the RNF43-mutant colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, reconstitution of RNF43 expression removes its response to exogenous Wnt. We conclude that RNF43 and ZNRF3 reduce Wnt signals by selectively ubiquitinating frizzled receptors, thereby targeting these Wnt receptors for degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2024591203,"Activation of the non-canonical, pro-inflammatory caspase-11 by Salmonella typhimurium is shown to contribute to bacterial spread and pathogenesis by the induction of macrophage cell death. Most known inflammasomes — multiprotein complexes central to innate immunity — induce cell death by activating pro-inflammatory caspase-1. The recent discovery of a subset of inflammasomes that targets caspase-11 prompted new directions of research in the field. This study of the roles of caspase-1 and -11 during Salmonella infections in mice, a model intracellular infection, shows that activation of caspase-11 by S. enterica Typhimurium, in the absence of immunity induced by caspase-1, contributes to bacterial spread and pathogenesis by inducing macrophage cell death. It will be important to determine whether caspase-11 activation has similar detrimental effects for the host in other infectious-disease models. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes assembled by intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and they initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens and danger signals by activating caspase-1 (ref. 1). Caspase-1 activation leads to the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, as well as lytic inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis2. Recently, a new non-canonical inflammasome was described that activates caspase-11, a pro-inflammatory caspase required for lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality3. This study also highlighted that previously generated caspase-1 knockout mice lack a functional allele of Casp11 (also known as Casp4), making them functionally Casp1 Casp11 double knockouts3,4,5,6. Previous studies have shown that these mice are more susceptible to infections with microbial pathogens1, including the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium)7,8, but the individual contributions of caspase-1 and caspase-11 to this phenotype are not known. Here we show that non-canonical caspase-11 activation contributes to macrophage death during S. typhimurium infection. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent interferon-β production is crucial for caspase-11 activation in macrophages, but is only partially required for pro-caspase-11 expression, consistent with the existence of an interferon-inducible activator of caspase-11. Furthermore, Casp1−/− mice were significantly more susceptible to infection with S. typhimurium than mice lacking both pro-inflammatory caspases (Casp1−/− Casp11−/−). This phenotype was accompanied by higher bacterial counts, the formation of extracellular bacterial microcolonies in the infected tissue and a defect in neutrophil-mediated clearance. These results indicate that caspase-11-dependent cell death is detrimental to the host in the absence of caspase-1-mediated innate immunity, resulting in extracellular replication of a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W1982318323,"Inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by homozygous deletion is a prototypic event in the cancer genome, yet such deletions often encompass neighbouring genes. We propose that homozygous deletions in such passenger genes can expose cancer-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities when the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a functionally redundant family of genes carrying out an essential function. The glycolytic gene enolase 1 (ENO1) in the 1p36 locus is deleted in glioblastoma (GBM), which is tolerated by the expression of ENO2. Here we show that short-hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing of ENO2 selectively inhibits growth, survival and the tumorigenic potential of ENO1-deleted GBM cells, and that the enolase inhibitor phosphonoacetohydroxamate is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells relative to ENO1-intact GBM cells or normal astrocytes. The principle of collateral vulnerability should be applicable to other passenger-deleted genes encoding functionally redundant essential activities and provide an effective treatment strategy for cancers containing such genomic events."

https://openalex.org/W2089054568,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a prevalent and devastating disease that claims more lives than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined. Current research suggests that standard chemotherapy regimens have been optimized to maximal efficiency. Promising new treatment strategies involve novel agents targeting molecular aberrations present in subsets of NSCLC. We evaluated 88 human NSCLC tumors of diverse histology and identified Mer and Axl as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) overexpressed in 69% and 93%, respectively, of tumors relative to surrounding normal lung tissue. Mer and Axl were also frequently overexpressed and activated in NSCLC cell lines. Ligand-dependent Mer or Axl activation stimulated MAPK, AKT and FAK signaling pathways indicating roles for these RTKs in multiple oncogenic processes. In addition, we identified a novel pro-survival pathway-involving AKT, CREB, Bcl-xL, survivin, and Bcl-2-downstream of Mer, which is differentially modulated by Axl signaling. We demonstrated that short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of Mer or Axl significantly reduced NSCLC colony formation and growth of subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Mer or Axl knockdown also improved in vitro NSCLC sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents by promoting apoptosis. When comparing the effects of Mer and Axl knockdown, Mer inhibition exhibited more complete blockade of tumor growth while Axl knockdown more robustly improved chemosensitivity. These results indicate that Mer and Axl have complementary and overlapping roles in NSCLC and suggest that treatment strategies targeting both RTKs may be more effective than singly-targeted agents. Our findings validate Mer and Axl as potential therapeutic targets in NSCLC and provide justification for development of novel therapeutic compounds that selectively inhibit Mer and/or Axl."

https://openalex.org/W2085242996,"Amyloids are highly aggregated proteinaceous fibers historically associated with neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and prion-based encephalopathies. Polymerization of amyloidogenic proteins into ordered fibers can be accelerated by preformed amyloid aggregates derived from the same protein in a process called seeding. Seeding of disease-associated amyloids and prions is highly specific and cross-seeding is usually limited or prevented. Here we describe the first study on the cross-seeding potential of bacterial functional amyloids. Curli are produced on the surface of many Gram-negative bacteria where they facilitate surface attachment and biofilm development. Curli fibers are composed of the major subunit CsgA and the nucleator CsgB, which templates CsgA into fibers. Our results showed that curli subunit homologs from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium LT2, and Citrobacter koseri were able to cross-seed in vitro. The polymerization of Escherichia coli CsgA was also accelerated by fibers derived from a distant homolog in Shewanella oneidensis that shares less than 30% identity in primary sequence. Cross-seeding of curli proteins was also observed in mixed colony biofilms with E. coli and S. typhimurium. CsgA was secreted from E. coli csgB- mutants assembled into fibers on adjacent S. typhimurium that presented CsgB on its surfaces. Similarly, CsgA was secreted by S. typhimurium csgB- mutants formed curli on CsgB-presenting E. coli. This interspecies curli assembly enhanced bacterial attachment to agar surfaces and supported pellicle biofilm formation. Collectively, this work suggests that the seeding specificity among curli homologs is relaxed and that heterogeneous curli fibers can facilitate multispecies biofilm development."
https://openalex.org/W2092759201,"The tumor microenvironment has an important role in cancer progression. Here we show that miR-148a is downregulated in 15 out of 16 samples (94%) of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) compared with matched normal tissue fibroblasts (NFs) established from patients with endometrial cancer. Laser-capture microdissection of stromal cells from normal tissue and endometrial cancer confirmed this observation. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-deoxycytidine stimulated the expression of miR-148a in the majority of CAFs implicating DNA methylation in the regulation of miR-148a expression. Investigation of miR-148a function in fibroblasts demonstrated that conditioned media (CM) from CAFs overexpressing miR-148a significantly impaired the migration of five endometrial cancer cell lines without affecting their growth rates in co-culture experiments. Among predicted miR-148a target genes are two WNT family members, WNT1 and WNT10B. Activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway in CAFs was confirmed by microarray analysis of gene expression and increased activity of the SuperTOPFlash luciferase reporter. We found elevated levels of WNT10B protein in CAFs and its level decreased when miR-148a was re-introduced by lentiviral infection. The 3′-UTR of WNT10B, cloned downstream of luciferase cDNA, suppressed luciferase activity when co-expressed with miR-148a indicating that WNT10B is a direct target of miR-148a. In contrast to the effect of miR-148a, WNT10B stimulated migration of endometrial cancer cell lines. Our findings have defined a molecular mechanism in the tumor microenvironment that is a novel target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2130471407,"Human telomeres are maintained by the enzyme telomerase, which uses a template within its integral RNA subunit (hTR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase protein (TERT) to accomplish the synthesis of single-stranded DNA repeats. Many questions remain unresolved about the cellular regulation of telomerase subunits and the fully assembled telomerase holoenzyme, including the basis for the specificity of binding and acting on telomeres. Previous studies have revealed that the telomere protein TPP1 is necessary for stable TERT and hTR association with telomeres in vivo. Here, we expand the biochemical characterization and understanding of TPP1 interaction with TERT and the catalytically active telomerase holoenzyme. Using extracts from human cells, we show that TPP1 interacts sequence-specifically with TERT when TERT is assembled into holoenzyme context. In holoenzyme context, the TERT N-terminal domain mediates a TPP1 interaction. Assays of stable subunit complexes purified after their cellular assembly suggest that other telomere proteins do not necessarily influence TPP1 association with telomerase holoenzyme or alter its impact on elongation processivity. We show that a domain of recombinant TPP1 comprised of an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold recapitulates the full-length protein interaction specificity for the TERT N-terminal domain assembled into telomerase holoenzyme. By global analysis of TPP1 side chain requirements for holoenzyme association, we demonstrate a selective requirement for the amino acids in one surface-exposed protein loop. Our results reveal the biochemical determinants of a sequence-specific TPP1-TERT interaction in human cells, with implications for the mechanisms of TPP1 function in recruiting telomerase subunits to telomeres and in promoting telomere elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2064253637,"The G protein-coupled β(2)-adrenoreceptor (β(2)AR) signals through the heterotrimeric G proteins G(s) and G(i) and β-arrestin. As such, the energy landscape of β(2)AR-excited state conformers is expected to be complex. Upon tagging Cys-265 of β(2)AR with a trifluoromethyl probe, (19)F NMR was used to assess conformations and possible equilibria between states. Here, we report key differences in β(2)AR conformational dynamics associated with the detergents used to stabilize the receptor. In dodecyl maltoside (DDM) micelles, the spectra are well represented by a single Lorentzian line that shifts progressively downfield with activation by appropriate ligand. The results are consistent with interconversion between two or more states on a time scale faster than the greatest difference in ligand-dependent chemical shift (i.e. >100 Hz). Given that high detergent off-rates of DDM monomers may facilitate conformational exchange between functional states of β(2)AR, we utilized the recently developed maltose-neopentyl glycol (MNG-3) diacyl detergent. In MNG-3 micelles, spectra indicated at least three distinct states, the relative populations of which depended on ligand, whereas no ligand-dependent shifts were observed, consistent with the slow exchange limit. Thus, detergent has a profound effect on the equilibrium kinetics between functional states. MNG-3, which has a critical micelle concentration in the nanomolar regime, exhibits an off-rate that is 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of DDM. High detergent off-rates are more likely to facilitate conformational exchange between distinct functional states associated with the G protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2049263539,"The activation of the small GTPase RhoA is necessary for ACh-induced actin polymerization and airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction, but the mechanism by which it regulates these events is unknown. Actin polymerization in ASM is catalyzed by the actin filament nucleation activator, N-WASp and the polymerization catalyst, Arp2/3 complex. Activation of the small GTPase cdc42, a specific N-WASp activator, is also required for actin polymerization and tension generation. We assessed the mechanism by which RhoA regulates actin dynamics and smooth muscle contraction by expressing the dominant negative mutants RhoA T19N and cdc42 T17N, and non-phosphorylatable paxillin Y118/31F and paxillin ΔLD4 deletion mutants in SM tissues. Their effects were evaluated in muscle tissue extracts and freshly dissociated SM cells. Protein interactions and cellular localization were analyzed using proximity ligation assays (PLA), immunofluorescence, and GTPase and kinase assays. RhoA inhibition prevented ACh-induced cdc42 activation, N-WASp activation and the interaction of N-WASp with the Arp2/3 complex at the cell membrane. ACh induced paxillin phosphorylation and its association with the cdc42 GEFS, DOCK180 and α/βPIX. Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with βPIX were RhoA-dependent, and were required for cdc42 activation. The ACh-induced recruitment of paxillin and FAK to the cell membrane was dependent on RhoA. We conclude that RhoA regulates the contraction of ASM by catalyzing the assembly and activation of cytoskeletal signaling modules at membrane adhesomes that initiate signaling cascades that regulate actin polymerization and tension development in response to contractile agonist stimulation. Our results suggest that the RhoA-mediated assembly of adhesome complexes is a fundamental step in the signal transduction process in response to agonist -induced smooth muscle contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2123184604,"Zinc and caspase-6 have independently been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders. Depletion of zinc intracellularly leads to apoptosis by an unknown mechanism. Zinc inhibits cysteine proteases, including the apoptotic caspases, leading to the hypothesis that zinc-mediated inhibition of caspase-6 might contribute to its regulation in a neurodegenerative context. Using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, we observed that caspase-6 binds one zinc per monomer, under the same conditions where the zinc leads to complete loss of enzymatic activity. To understand the molecular details of zinc binding and inhibition, we performed an anomalous diffraction experiment above the zinc edge. The anomalous difference maps showed strong 5σ peaks, indicating the presence of one zinc/monomer bound at an exosite distal from the active site. Zinc was not observed bound to the active site. The zinc in the exosite was liganded by Lys-36, Glu-244, and His-287 with a water molecule serving as the fourth ligand, forming a distorted tetrahedral ligation sphere. This exosite appears to be unique to caspase-6, as the residues involved in zinc binding were not conserved across the caspase family. Our data suggest that binding of zinc at the exosite is the primary route of inhibition, potentially locking caspase-6 into the inactive helical conformation."

The relationship between the percentage of Th17 cells and clinical prognosis differs among cancers. The mechanism responsible for the increasing percentage of such cells in NPC is still unknown, as is their biological function. Here, our data showed an increase of Th17 cells in tumor tissues relative to their numbers in normal nasopharynx tissues or in the matched peripheral blood of NPC patients. Th17 cells in tumor tissue produced more IFNγ than did those in the peripheral blood of matched NPC patients and healthy controls. We observed high levels of CD154, G-CSF, CXCL1, IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) out of 36 cytokines examined in tumor tissue cultures. MIF promoted the generation and recruitment of Th17 cells mediated by NPC tumor cells in vitro; this promoting effect was mainly dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and was mediated by the MIF-CXCR4 axis. Finally, the expression level of MIF in tumor cells and in TILs was positively correlated in NPC tumor tissues, and the frequency of MIF-positive TILs was positively correlated with NPC patient clinical outcomes. Taken together, our findings illustrate that tumor-derived MIF can affect patient prognosis, which might be related to the increase of Th17 cells in the NPC tumor microenvironment.

However, the mechanistic relationships in NPC between the accumulation of Th17 cells, the cytokines released from tumor environments, and tumorigenesis and progression remain unknown. In this study, our results indicated an elevated percentage of Th17 cells in the NPC tumor microenvironment. We have shown for the first time that microenvironment-derived macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) promoted the generation and migration of Th17 cells mediated by tumor cells, and the promotion effect of MIF on the generation and recruitment of Th17 cells was mainly dependent on the mTOR pathway and was mediated by the MIF-CXCR4 axis. Most importantly, the expression of MIF in TILs predicted an improved clinical outcome in NPC. Taken together, our data provide novel evidence that tumor-derived cytokines affect the development of cancer and its prognosis, and they are associated with Th17 cell subset expansion within the tumor microenvironment. These results deepen our understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms involved in NPC progression. Tumor biopsy tissues and peripheral blood were collected from 21 newly diagnosed NPC patients at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (supplemental Table 1) in 2009 and 2010, and peripheral blood was collected from 21 age-matched healthy individuals. The tumor tissues were divided and cultured for a short period in RPMI 1640 complete medium with a low dose (20 IU/ml) of IL-2 to obtain sufficient lymphocytes, after which the cells were used to generate TILs or in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from blood samples taken from NPC patients and healthy individuals were isolated and then frozen for FACS analyses. One hundred and eight paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from NPC patients were collected in a previous study by our group, and detailed patient information was provided (15Zhang Y.L. Li J. Mo H.Y. Qiu F. Zheng L.M. Qian C.N. Zeng Y.X. Different subsets of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes correlate with NPC progression in different ways.Mol. Cancer. 2010; 9: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration; all patients and healthy controls signed a consent form approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. An EBV-transformed LCL line and the NPC tumor cell lines C666 (EBV+) and CNE2 (EBV−) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The normal nasopharyngeal (NP) cell line NP69 was maintained in keratinocyte-SFM medium (Invitrogen). TILs were isolated from NPC biopsy tissues and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 1 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and recombinant human IL-2 (300 IU/ml). They were grown using a rapid expansion protocol, as described previously (16Dudley M.E. Wunderlich J.R. Shelton T.E. Even J. Rosenberg S.A. Generation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures for use in adoptive transfer therapy for melanoma patients.J. Immunother. 2003; 26: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The expression of T cell markers was analyzed by FACS after surface or intracellular staining with anti-human-specific antibodies conjugated with fluorescent molecules. These human antibodies included anti-CD4, anti-CCR6, anti-IL-17, anti-IFNγ, anti-IL-2, anti-IL-10, anti-IL-4, anti-TGFβ, anti-CCR7, anti-CD45RO, anti-CD45RA, anti-CTLA-4, and anti-GITR. These were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin, allophycocyanin, or phycoerythrin-Cy7 (BD Biosciences or eBioscience). Recombinant human IL-2, TGFβ, and IL-1β were purchased from R&D Systems. Intracellular staining for IL-17 and other cytokines was performed on T cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin for 4 h in RPMI 1640 medium, and cytokine secretion was blocked by the addition of brefeldin A (10 μg/ml, Sigma). After washing, cells were stained with anti-CD4, then were fixed and permeabilized with Perm/Fix solution (eBiosciences), and finally were stained intracellularly with anti-IL-17A or with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies for other cytokines. All stained cells were analyzed on an FC500 flow cytometer, and the obtained data were analyzed with CXP software (Beckman Coulter). Naive CD4+ T cells were cultured in T cell medium containing 100 IU/ml IL-2 and 10% FBS at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 48-well plate and were stimulated with plate-bound OKT3 (1 μg/ml). The naive CD4+ T cells were co-cultured with irradiated NPC tumor cells or irradiated C666 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA or pooled MIF-siRNAs at a 1:1 ratio or in the presence of RhIL-1β (25 ng/ml), RhTGFβ (3 ng/ml), or RhIL-1β and RhTGFβ together for 7 days. Half the medium was replaced with fresh medium on days 3 and 6. After 7 days, the percentage of Th17 cells was determined by FACS analysis. The experiments were repeated in triplicate. The RhMIF (R&D Systems), the MIF small molecule antagonist (SR)3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1, Sigma), cyclosporin A (CsA, Sigma), or rapamycin (Enzo Life Science) was added to the medium at various concentrations in a subset of the samples as reported before (17Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 18Kopf H. de la Rosa G.M.

Immunopharmacol. 2007; 7: 1819-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). NPC tumor cell lines (2.5 × 105 per well) or single cell suspensions from collagenase type IV-digested NPC or normal NP tissues were cultured in 6-well plates in 2% FBS RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h. The supernatants were then collected for detection of cytokines. Cytokines in the culture medium were measured using the Human Cytokine Array Panel A (Proteome Profiler; R&D Systems). All cytokine protein array analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Positive controls were paired spots located in the upper left, lower right, and lower left corners of each array. Migration assays of TILs from NPC patients were performed using 24-well Transwell chemotaxis plates (5-mm pore size; Corning Costar) as described previously (14Su X. Ye J. Hsueh E.C. Zhang Y. Hoft D.F. Peng G. Tumor microenvironments direct the recruitment and expansion of human Th17 cells.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). TILs were induced to migrate with supernatants from various cell lines. In some cases, the MIF small molecule antagonist ISO-1(50–100 μm) or neutral anti-CXCR4 antibody (5–10 μm) (19Baribaud F. Edwards T.G. Sharron M. Brelot A. Heveker N. Price K. Mortari F. Alizon M. Tsang M. Doms R.W. Antigenically distinct conformations of CXCR4.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8957-8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was added 150 min before the migration assay. The migration of the Th17 cell subset was evaluated based on the percentage of Th17 cells in the inner and outer chambers. The experiments were repeated in triplicate. MIF immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out using a primary monoclonal mouse anti-human MIF antibody (1:100 dilution, ab55445, Abcam), per manufacturer's instructions. The slides were scored independently by two pathologists blinded to the clinicopathological data of the NPC patients. The level of MIF expression in the tumor cells was scored based on staining intensity (score 0–3) and area (score 1–4), as described previously (20Wee A. Teh M. Raju G.C. Clinical importance of p53 protein in gallbladder carcinoma and its precursor lesions.J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 47: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); the final expression level was scored as the product of the staining intensity and area scores. The level of MIF expression in lymphocytes was obtained by counting the positively and negatively stained lymphocytes in five separate ×400 high power microscopic fields and calculating the mean percentage of positively stained lymphocytes among the total lymphocytes per field. Mouse anti-human IgG1 (1:200 dilution, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was used as a negative control in this study. All analyses were carried out with SPSS 13.0. Numerical data are presented as the means ± S.E. A standard two-tailed Student's t test and paired Student's t test were used for comparison of numerical data, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant in this study. The median of the MIF expression level in tumor cells or in lymphocytes was used as a cutoff subgroup for MIF immunohistochemical variables in our data. The Pearson χ2 test was carried out to assess the relationships among IHC variables. The survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and tested by log-rank analysis. A Cox regression model was applied for multivariate analyses. An increase of Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment is becoming recognized as a general characteristic of cancers (11Kryczek I.

We investigated the percentage of Th17 cells in PBMCs and among TILs from 21 newly diagnosed NPC patients and from healthy donors. Fig. 1A shows representative FACS plots of PBMCs from two patients and two controls. The percentage of circulating Th17 cells in 21 NPC patients was significantly lower than that in 21 healthy controls (Fig. 1B; p < 0.001). We also compared the distribution of the Th17 cell subset in tumor tissues versus in peripheral blood from individual NPC patients (Fig. 1C). We found the percentage of Th17 cells was significantly higher in tumor tissues (Fig. 1D, p < 0.001; supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm the increase of Th17 cells in NPC tumor microenvironments, we compared the percentage of Th17 cells in matched sets of samples of peripheral blood and nontumor and tumor tissues from the nasopharynx of NPC patients (Fig. 2, A and B). The percentage of Th17 cells was significantly higher in tumor tissue versus PBMCs or normal tissue and in normal tissue versus PBMCs (Fig. 2C, p < 0.05). The percentage of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells was significantly increased in tumors and peripheral blood relative to normal tissue (Fig. 2D, p < 0.05). The percentage of CD4+ IFNγ-producing cells was not significantly different among the three tissues (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the frequency of Foxp3+ IL-17-producing cells and IFNγ+ IL-17-producing cells in tumor tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissues and PBMCs (data not shown). To explore the biological properties of Th17 cells, we analyzed their phenotypic markers on cells from circulating blood and from the tumor microenvironment. As shown in Fig. 3A, among PBMCs, the Th17 cells were only found among CD45RO+ and CD45RA− memory cells, and the Th17 cells expressed a high level of CCR6 and some CCR7 but lacked expression of CTLA4 and GITR. Among TILs, the Th17 cells were also found only among CD45RO+ and CD45RA− memory cells and expressed a high level of CCR6, a low level of CCR7, some CTLA4, and a low level of GITR. We also evaluated the profiles of cytokines, including IL-2, IFNγ, IL-4, IL-10, TGFβ, and GrB, released by the Th17 cell subset among PBMCs and TILs from NPC patients and among PBMCs from healthy controls. All Th17 cells expressed high levels of IL-2 and low levels of IL-4, IL-10, TGFβ, and granzyme B (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the Th17 cells among TILs secreted a large amount of IFNγ, significantly more than from the Th17 cells among the PBMCs of NPC patients or healthy donors (p < 0.001). The mechanism for the accumulation of Th17 cells in the NPC tumor microenvironment has been elusive, although tumor cells and immune cells often contribute to the induction of immune tolerance and inflammation at tumor sites (14Su X.

Oncol. 2010; 136: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To address whether NPC tumor cells could induce the generation or migration of Th17 cells in vitro, we first investigated the induction of Th17 cell differentiation from CD4+ T cells. Purified naive CD4+ T cells were co-cultured with the irradiated NPC cell lines CNE2 (EBV−) or C666 (EBV+), the normal NP cell line NP69, the EBV-transformed lymphoid blast cell line LCL, or in the presence of cytokines. Cells were cultured for 7 days in medium containing IL-2. RhTGFβ, RhIL-1β, or both were included as controls. The resulting percentage of IL-17-producing T cells was evaluated by FACS. We found that naive CD4+ T cells co-cultured with C666 cells, with cytokine IL-1β, or with a combination of IL-1β and TGFβ exhibited a higher percentage of IL-17-producing cell differentiation in vitro relative to the other co-cultures (Fig. 4, A and B); these experiments were repeated three times. Next, we examined whether the supernatants of NPC tumor cells could attract the migration of Th17 cells from TILs or PBMCs (Fig. 4C). A higher percentage of Th17 cells was present in the outer well of a Transwell assay of TILs cultured with supernatants from the NPC C666 (p < 0.05) or CNE2 cell lines, indicating that the cytokines released from NPC cell lines attracted Th17 cells more strongly than those from normal NP cells or media alone (Fig. 4D). The supernatants from C666 and CNE2 cells also attracted the migration of Th17 cells from a PBMC population (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that NPC tumor-derived cytokines and chemokines may induce Th17 cell generation and chemotaxis. To explore whether tumor-derived cytokines may affect NPC tumor microenvironments, we evaluated cytokine profiles of nontumor and tumor tissues from an NPC patient and of the NPC cell lines C666 (EBV+) and CNE2 (EBV−), using a Proteome Profiler Array as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 36 analyzed cytokines are listed in Table 1. CD154, G-CSF, CXCL1, CD54, IL-6, IL-8, MIF, serpin E1, and SDF-1 were detectable in one or more of the culture supernatants, as shown in Table 1. G-CSF, CXCL1, IL-6, IL-8, MIF, and serpin E1 were detectable in the supernatant of normal NP tissues. Overall, MIF was the only cytokine found at a high level in all the supernatants (supplemental Fig. S2).TABLE 1Cytokines and chemokines released from NPC tumor cell lines, NPC tissue, or normal NP tissue in vitroCytokineAlternative nomenclatureC666 (EBV+)CNE2 (EBV−)NPC tissueNormal NP tissueC5aComplement component 5a−−−−CD154CD40 ligand+++−G-CSFCSFβ, CSF-3−−++GM-CSFCSFα, CSF-2−−−−GROαCXCL1−−++I-309CCL1−−−−CD54sICAM-1+−−−IFN-γType II IFN−−−−IL-1αIL-F1−−−−IL-1βIL-1F2−−−−IL-1raIL-F3−−−−IL-2−−−−IL-4−−−−IL-5−−−−IL-6−−++IL-8CXCL8−−++IL-10−−−−IL-12p70−−−−IL-13−−−−IL-16LCF−−−−IL-17−−−−IL-17E−−−−IL-23−−−−IL-27−−−−IL-32α−−−−IP-10CXCL10−−−−I-TACCXCL11−−−−MCP-1CCL2−−−−MIFGIF, DER6++++++MIP-1αCCL3−−−−MIP-1βCCL4−−−−Serpin E1PAI-1−+−+RANTESCCL5−−−−SDF-1CXCL12++−−TNFαTNFSF 1A−−−−sTREM-1−−−- Open table in a new tab Based on the high expression levels of MIF in the NPC tumor microenvironment and on reports that MIF may be involved in the generation of IL-17-producing cells in mice (26Addis M.F.

In a culture of CD4+ naive T cells with C666 NPC cells, the presence of the MIF small molecule inhibitor ISO-1 reduced the generation of Th17 cells (p < 0.05); in addition, the generation of Th17 cells also noticeably decreased when CD4+ naive T cells were co-cultured with C666 transfected with siRNAs against MIF (Fig. 5, A and B; supplemental Fig. S3). In a Transwell chemotaxis assay, ISO-1 and the supernatants from MIF-siRNA-transfected C666 cells noticeably decreased the migration of Th17 cells to the outer well (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5, C and D; supplemental Fig. S3). The ability of MIF directly to promote the migration of Th17 cells in an NPC TIL population was also demonstrated (supplemental Fig. S4). It has recently been reported that the transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γτ, the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and the transcription factor STAT3 were the key molecules in the induction and differentiation of human Th17 cells (28Harris T.J.

https://openalex.org/W2129447854,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) is refractory to hormone therapy and new strategies for treatment are urgently needed. We found that androgen-insensitive (AI) PCa cells, LNCaP-AI, are reprogrammed to upregulate the mitotic kinase Plk1 (Polo-like kinase 1) and other M-phase cell-cycle proteins, which may underlie AI PCa growth. In androgen-depleted media, LNCaP-AI cells showed exquisite sensitivity to growth inhibition by subnanomolar concentrations of a small molecule inhibitor of Plk1, BI2536, suggesting that these cells are dependent on Plk1 for growth. In contrast, the androgen-responsive parental LNCaP cells showed negligible responses to BI2536 treatment under the same condition. BI2536 treatment of LNCaP-AI cells resulted in an increase in cell death marker PARP-1 (polymerase-1) but did not activate caspase-3, an apoptosis marker, suggesting that the observed cell death was caspase-independent. BI2536-treated LNCaP-AI cells formed multinucleated giant cells that contain clusters of nuclear vesicles indicative of mitotic catastrophe. Live-cell time-lapse imaging revealed that BI2536-treated giant LNCaP-AI cells underwent necroptosis, as evidenced by ‘explosive’ cell death and partial reversal of cell death by a necroptosis inhibitor. Our studies suggest that LNCaP-AI cells underwent reprogramming in both their cell growth and cell death pathways, rendering them highly sensitive to Plk1 inhibition that induces necroptosis. Harnessing necroptosis through Plk1 inhibition may be explored for therapeutic intervention of castration-resistant PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2001804573,"Nanodiscs are self-assembled ∼50-nm(2) patches of lipid bilayers stabilized by amphipathic belt proteins. We demonstrate that a well ordered dense film of nanodiscs serves for non-destructive, label-free studies of isolated membrane proteins in a native like environment using neutron reflectometry (NR). This method exceeds studies of membrane proteins in vesicle or supported lipid bilayer because membrane proteins can be selectively adsorbed with controlled orientation. As a proof of concept, the mechanism of action of the membrane-anchored cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is studied here. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of electrons from NADPH to cytochrome P450s and thus is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of numerous primary and secondary metabolites in plants. Neutron reflectometry shows a coexistence of two different POR conformations, a compact and an extended form with a thickness of 44 and 79 Å, respectively. Upon complete reduction by NADPH, the conformational equilibrium shifts toward the compact form protecting the reduced FMN cofactor from engaging in unspecific electron transfer reaction."

Here, we explore Sin3A, a member of the Sin3 family of proteins linked to tumorigenesis that are thought to regulate gene expression through their role as histone deacetylases (HDACs). We identified Drosophila Sin3a as an important mediator of oncogenic Ret receptor in a fly model of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. Reducing Drosophila Sin3a activity led to metastasis-like behavior and, in the presence of Diap1, secondary tumors distant from the site of origin. Genetic and Chip-Seq analyses identified previously undescribed Sin3a targets including genes involved in cell motility and actin dynamics, as well as signaling pathways including Src, Jnk and Rho. A key Sin3a oncogenic target, PP1B, regulates stability of β-Catenin/Armadillo: the outcome is to oppose T-cell factor (TCF) function and Wg/Wnt pathway signaling in both fly and mammalian cancer cells. Reducing Sin3A strongly increased the invasive behavior of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. We show that Sin3A is downregulated in a variety of human tumors and that Src, JNK, RhoA and PP1B/β-Catenin are regulated in a manner analogous to our Drosophila models. Our data suggest that Sin3A influences a specific step of tumorigenesis by regulating a module of genes involved in cell invasion. Tumor progression may commonly rely on such ‘modules of invasion’ under the control of broad transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1980663890,"Hemojuvelin (HJV) and matriptase-2 (MT2) are co-expressed in hepatocytes, and both are essential for systemic iron homeostasis. HJV is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein that acts as a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins to induce hepcidin expression. MT2 regulates the levels of membrane-bound HJV in hepatocytes by binding to and cleaving HJV into an inactive soluble form that is released from cells. HJV also interacts with neogenin, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein with multiple functions. In this study, we showed that neogenin interacted with MT2 as well as with HJV and facilitated the cleavage of HJV by MT2. In contrast, neogenin was not cleaved by MT2, indicating some degree of specificity by MT2. Down-regulation of neogenin with siRNA increased the amount of MT2 and HJV on the plasma membrane, suggesting a lack of neogenin involvement in their trafficking to the cell surface. The increase in MT2 and HJV upon neogenin knockdown was likely due to the inhibition of cell surface MT2 and HJV internalization. Analysis of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides showed that MT2 cleavage of cell surface HJV was coupled to a transition from high mannose oligosaccharides to complex oligosaccharides on HJV. These results suggest that neogenin forms a ternary complex with both MT2 and HJV at the plasma membrane. The complex facilitates HJV cleavage by MT2, and release of the cleaved HJV from the cell occurs after a retrograde trafficking through the TGN/Golgi compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2011398252,"Tumor metastasis is responsible for most cancer patients' deaths. Understanding the mechanism of metastasis is crucial for improving the cure rate for cancer. Here, we report that Gankyrin, a chaperone of ubiquitin-proteasome, has an essential role in breast cancer metastasis. We find that Gankyrin is highly overexpressed in human breast cancers and the expression correlates strongly with lymph node metastasis. Knocking down Gankyrin expression in highly metastatic human breast cancer cells significantly decreases cancer cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of Gankyrin inhibits intrinsic Rac1 activity and induces large focal adhesions. Overexpression of Gankyrin accelerates focal adhesion turnover and increases cell migration. Notably, reduction of Gankyrin expression in mouse mammary tumor cell significantly decreases tumor metastasis to lung in animal models. Therefore, our findings suggest that Gankyrin is crucial for breast cancer metastasis and highlight the potential of Gankyrin as a therapeutic target for tumor metastasis."

Heparanase is an enzyme that cleaves HS and is known to display a variety of pathophysiological effects in cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer disease. The link between heparanase and diseases is a result of its selective cleavage of HS, which releases smaller HS fragments to enhance cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Despite its importance in pathological diseases, the structural cues in HS that direct heparanase cleavage and the steps of HS depolymerization remain unknown. Here, we sought to probe the substrate specificity of heparanase using a series of structurally defined oligosaccharide substrates. The sites of heparanase cleavage on the oligosaccharide substrates were determined by mass spectrometry and gel permeation chromatography. We discovered that heparanase cleaves the linkage of glucuronic acid linked to glucosamine carrying 6-O-sulfo groups. Furthermore, our findings suggest that heparanase displays different cleavage modes by recognizing the structures of the nonreducing ends of the substrates. Our results deepen the understanding of the action mode of heparanase."

The efficacy of these compounds on inhibiting Aβ fibril formation and toxicity in vitro was assessed using a combination of biophysical techniques and viability assays. Using structure activity relationship data from the in vitro assays, we identified compounds capable of preventing pathological self-assembly of Aβ42 leading to decreased cell toxicity."

Recently, targeting the endocannabinoid system in models of AD has emerged as a potential approach to slow the progression of the disease process. Although studies have identified neuroprotective roles for endocannabinoids, there is a paucity of information on modulation of the pro-survival Notch pathway by endocannabinoids. In this study the influence of the endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, on the Notch-1 pathway and on its endogenous regulators were investigated in an in vitro model of AD. We report that AEA up-regulates Notch-1 signaling in cultured neurons. We also provide evidence that although Aβ1–42 increases expression of the endogenous inhibitor of Notch-1, numb (Nb), this can be prevented by AEA and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Interestingly, AEA up-regulated Nct expression, a component of γ-secretase, and this was found to play a crucial role in the enhanced Notch-1 signaling mediated by AEA. The stimulatory effects of AEA on Notch-1 signaling persisted in the presence of Aβ1–42. AEA was found to induce a preferential processing of Notch-1 over amyloid precursor protein to generate Aβ1–40. Aging, a natural process of neurodegeneration, was associated with a reduction in Notch-1 signaling in rat cortex and hippocampus, and this was restored with chronic treatment with URB 597. In summary, AEA has the proclivity to enhance Notch-1 signaling in an in vitro model of AD, which may have relevance for restoring neurogenesis and cognition in AD.

https://openalex.org/W2085269111,"The finding that eukaryotic lanthionine synthetase C-like protein 1 (LanCL1) is a glutathione-binding protein prompted us to investigate the potential relationship between LanCL1 and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS). CBS is a trans-sulfuration enzyme critical for the reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis and GSH-dependent defense against oxidative stress. In this study we found that LanCL1 bound to CBS in mouse cortex and HEK293 cells. Mapping studies revealed that the binding region in LanCL1 spans amino acids 158-169, and that in CBS contains N-terminal and C-terminal regulatory domains. Recombinant His-LanCL1 directly bound endogenous CBS from mouse cortical lysates and inhibited its activity. Overexpression of LanCL1 inhibited CBS activity in HEK293 cells. CBS activity is reported to be regulated by oxidative stress. Here we found that oxidative stress induced by H(2)O(2) or glutamate lowered the GSH/GSSG ratio, dissociated LanCL1 from CBS, and elevated CBS activity in primary rat cortical neurons. Decreasing the GSH/GSSG ratio by adding GSSG to cellular extracts also dissociated LanCL1 from CBS. Either lentiviral knockdown of LanCL1 or specific disruption of the LanCL1-CBS interaction using the peptide Tat-LanCL1(153-173) released CBS activity in neurons but occluded CBS activation in response to oxidative stress, indicating the major contribution of the LanCL1-CBS interaction to the regulation of CBS activity. Furthermore, LanCL1 knockdown or Tat-LanCL1(153-173) treatment reduced H(2)O(2) or glutamate-induced neuronal damage. This study implies potential therapeutic value in targeting the LanCL1-CBS interaction for neuronal oxidative stress-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2086864266,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a very rare genetic disorder that is characterized by multiple features of premature aging and largely affects tissues of mesenchymal origin. In this study, we describe the development of a tissue-specific mouse model that overexpresses the most common HGPS mutation (LMNA, c.1824C>T, p.G608G) in osteoblasts. Already at the age of 5 weeks, HGPS mutant mice show growth retardation, imbalanced gait and spontaneous fractures. Histopathological examination revealed an irregular bone structure, characterized by widespread loss of osteocytes, defects in mineralization, and a hypocellular red bone marrow. Computerized tomography analysis demonstrated impaired skeletal geometry and altered bone structure. The skeletal defects, which resemble the clinical features reported for bone disease in HGPS patients, was associated with an abnormal osteoblast differentiation. The osteoblast-specific expression of the HGPS mutation increased DNA damage and affected Wnt signaling. In the teeth, irregular dentin formation, as was previously demonstrated in human progeria cases, caused severe dental abnormalities affecting the incisors. The observed phenotype also shows similarities to reported bone abnormalities in aging mice and may therefore help to uncover general principles of the aging process."

Dysregulation of transcriptional factor myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) has been implicated in the pathogenic process in in vivo and in vitro models of PD. Here, we identified a small molecule bis(3)-cognitin (B3C) as a potent activator of MEF2D. We showed that B3C attenuated the toxic effects of neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by activating MEF2D via multiple mechanisms. B3C significantly reduced MPP+-induced oxidative stress and potentiated Akt to down-regulate the activity of MEF2 inhibitor glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in a DA neuronal cell line SN4741. Furthermore, B3C effectively rescued MEF2D from MPP+-induced decline in both nucleic and mitochondrial compartments. B3C offered SN4741 cells potent protection against MPP+-induced apoptosis via MEF2D. Interestingly, B3C also protected SN4741 cells from wild type or mutant A53T α-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity. Using the in vivo PD model of C57BL/6 mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP), we showed that B3C maintained redox homeostasis, promoted Akt function activity, and restored MEF2D level in midbrain neurons. Moreover, B3C greatly prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase signal in substantial nigra pars compacta DA neurons and ameliorated behavioral impairments in mice treated with MPTP.

This novel approach combines force clamp measurements of bond lifetimes with the binding mode to quantify the dependence of the binding probability on the interaction time. We found that fibrinogen-reactive αIIbβ3 pre-exists in at least two states that differ in their zero force on-rates (kon1 = 1.4 × 10−4 and kon2 = 2.3 × 10−4 μm2/s), off-rates (koff1 = 2.42 and koff2 = 0.60 s−1), and dissociation constants (Kd1 = 1.7 × 104 and Kd2 = 2.6 × 103 μm−2).

To investigate the concerted effect of multiple enzymes on the folding of small disulfide-rich peptides, we sequenced and expressed protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, and immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) from Conus venom glands. Conus PDI was shown to catalyze the oxidation and reduction of disulfide bonds in two conotoxins, α-GI and α-ImI. Oxidative folding rates were further increased in the presence of Conus PPI with the maximum effect observed in the presence of both enzymes. In contrast, Conus BiP was only observed to assist folding in the presence of microsomes, suggesting that additional co-factors were involved. The identification of a complex between BiP, PDI, and nascent conotoxins further suggests that the folding and assembly of conotoxins is a highly regulated multienzyme-assisted process. Unexpectedly, all three enzymes contributed to the folding of the ribbon isomer of α-ImI. Here, we identify this alternative disulfide-linked species in the venom of Conus imperialis, providing the first evidence for the existence of a “non-native” peptide isomer in the venom of cone snails.

https://openalex.org/W1971870999,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be cleaved by α-secretases in neural cells to produce the soluble APP ectodomain (sAPPα), which is neuroprotective. We have shown previously that activation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) triggers sAPPα shedding from neural cells. Here, we demonstrate that the activation of ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins is required for the P2X7R-dependent proteolytic processing of APP leading to sAPPα release. Indeed, the down-regulation of ERM by siRNA blocked the P2X7R-dependent shedding of sAPPα. We also show that P2X7R stimulation triggered the phosphorylation of ERM. Thus, ezrin translocates to the plasma membrane to interact with P2X7R. Using specific pharmacological inhibitors, we established the order in which several enzymes trigger the P2X7R-dependent release of sAPPα. Thus, a Rho kinase and the MAPK modules ERK1/2 and JNK act upstream of ERM, whereas a PI3K activity is triggered downstream. For the first time, this work identifies ERM as major partners in the regulated non-amyloidogenic processing of APP."
https://openalex.org/W2003482250,"IsdG and IsdI are paralogous heme degrading enzymes from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Heme bound by these enzymes is extensively ruffled such that the meso-carbons at the sites of oxidation are distorted toward bound oxygen. In contrast, the canonical heme oxygenase family degrades heme that is bound with minimal distortion. Trp-66 is a conserved heme pocket residue in IsdI implicated in heme ruffling. IsdI variants with Trp-66 replaced with residues having less bulky aromatic and alkyl side chains were characterized with respect to catalytic activity, heme ruffling, and electrochemical properties. The heme degradation activity of the W66Y and W66F variants was approximately half that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the W66L and W66A variants were inactive. A crystal structure and NMR spectroscopic analysis of the W66Y variant reveals that heme binds to this enzyme with less heme ruffling than observed for wild-type IsdI. The reduction potential of this variant (-96 ± 7 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode) is similar to that of wild-type IsdI (-89 ± 7 mV), so we attribute the diminished activity of this variant to the diminished heme ruffling observed for heme bound to this enzyme and conclude that Trp-66 is required for optimal catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2167750668,"Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 and type 2 (HTLV-1 and -2) are two closely related retroviruses with the former causing adult T cell leukemia. HTLV-2 infection is prevalent among intravenous drug users, and the viral genome encodes the viral transactivator Tax, which is highly homologous to the transforming protein Tax from HTLV-1. However, the link between HTLV-2 infection and leukemia has not been established. In the present study, we evaluated the activity of HTLV-2 Tax in promoting aberrant proliferation of human CD4 T lymphocytes. Tax2 efficiently immortalized CD4(+) memory T lymphocytes with a CD3/TCRαβ/CD4/CD25/CD45RO/CD69 immunophenotype, promoted constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt, IκB kinase/NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and STAT3, and it also increased the level of Mcl-1. Disruption of these oncogenic pathways led to growth retardation and apoptotic cell death of the Tax2-established T cell lines. We further found that Tax2 induced autophagy by interacting with the autophagy molecule complex containing Beclin1 and PI3K class III to form the LC3(+) autophagosome. Tax2-mediated autophagy promoted survival and proliferation of the immortalized T cells. The present study demonstrated the oncogenic properties of Tax2 in human T cells and also implicated Tax2 in serving as a molecular tool to generate distinct T cell subtype lines."

We have identified PKN1 as a novel downstream target of NFATc1-cyclin D1/CDK6 activity in mediating vascular wall remodeling following injury. MCP-1, a potent chemoattractant protein, besides enhancing HASMC motility, also induced its growth, and these effects require NFATc1-dependent cyclin D1 expression and CDK4/6 activity. In addition, MCP-1 induced PKN1 activation in a sustained and NFATc1-cyclin D1/CDK6-dependent manner. Furthermore, PKN1 activation is required for MCP-1-induced HASMC growth and migration. Balloon injury induced PKN1 activation in NFAT-dependent manner and pharmacological or dominant negative mutant-mediated blockade of PKN1 function or siRNA-mediated down-regulation of its levels substantially suppressed balloon injury-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation resulting in reduced neointima formation. These novel findings suggest that PKN1 plays a critical role in vascular wall remodeling, and therefore, it could be a promising new target for the next generation of drugs for vascular diseases, particularly restenosis following angioplasty, stent implantation, or vein grafting."
https://openalex.org/W1980260817,"Progesterone acting through the progesterone receptor (PR) and its coregulators prepares the human endometrium for receptivity to embryo implantation and maintains pregnancy. The menstrual cycle-dependent expression of melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-11) in the mid-secretory human endometrium suggested a novel function in human PR signaling. Here we show that MAGE-11 is an isoform-specific coregulator responsible for the greater transcriptional activity of human PR-B relative to PR-A. PR was recruited to progesterone response regions of progesterone-regulated FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) immunophilin and small Ras family G protein cell growth inhibitor RASD1 genes. Expression of MAGE-11 lentivirus shRNA in human endometrial Ishikawa cells expressing PR-B showed that MAGE-11 is required for isoform-specific PR-B up-regulation of FKBP5. In contrast, MAGE-11 was not required for progesterone up-regulation of RASD1 in endometrial cells expressing the PR-A/B heterodimer. Target gene specificity of PR-B depended on the synergistic actions of MAGE-11 and p300 mediated by the unique PR-B NH(2)-terminal (110)LLXXVLXXLL(119) motif that interacts with the MAGE-11 F-box region in a phosphorylation- and ubiquitinylation-dependent manner. A progesterone-dependent mechanism is proposed in which MAGE-11 and p300 increase PR-B up-regulation of the FKBP5 gene. MAGE-11 down-regulates PR-B, similar to the effects of progesterone, and interacts with FKBP5 to stabilize a complex with PR-B. We conclude that the coregulator function of MAGE-11 extends to isoform-specific regulation of PR-B during the cyclic development of the human endometrium."
https://openalex.org/W2000922399,"Epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most aggressive non-melanoma skin cancer and is dramatically increased in patients undergoing immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Recent clinical studies show that use of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin as a post-transplantation immunosuppressive significantly reduces SCC occurrence compared with other immunosuppressives, though the mechanism is not fully understood. We show that rapamycin selectively upregulates epidermal Akt1, while failing to upregulate epidermal Akt2. Rapamycin increases epidermal Akt1 phosphorylation via inhibition of the mTOR complex 1-dependent regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1. Epidermal Akt1 is commonly downregulated in SCC while Akt2 is upregulated. We now demonstrate similar Akt1 downregulation and Akt2 upregulation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the most important skin carcinogen. Hence, rapamycin's upregulation of Akt1 signaling could potentially oppose the effects of UV radiation and/or tumor-associated changes on Akt1 signaling. We show in skin culture that rapamycin does enhance restoration of Akt1 phosphorylation in skin recovering from UV radiation, suggesting a mechanism for rapamycin's antitumor activity in epidermis in spite of its efficient immunosuppressive properties."

Trans-repression of il12a transcription, which encodes IL-12 p35 chain, by proteins of the Notch family and lysine deacetylation reactions have been reported as the underlying mechanisms, but a number of questions remain to be addressed. Zymosan produced the location of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) to the nucleus, enhanced its association with the il12a promoter, increased the nuclear concentration of the SIRT1 co-substrate NAD+, and decreased chromatin accessibility in the nucleosome-1 of il12a, which contains a κB-site. The involvement of deacetylation reactions in the inhibition of il12a transcription was supported by the absence of Ac-Lys-14-histone H3 in dendritic cells treated with zymosan upon coimmunoprecipitation of transducin-like enhancer of split. In contrast, we did not obtain evidence of a possible effect of SIRT1 through the deacetylation of c-Rel, the central element of the NF-κB family involved in il12a regulation. These data indicate that an enhancement of SIRT1 activity in response to phagocytic stimuli may reduce the accessibility of c-Rel to the il12a promoter and its transcriptional activation, thus regulating the IL-12 p70/IL-23 balance and modulating the ongoing immune response.

The involvement of deacetylation reactions in the inhibition of il12a transcription was supported by the absence of Ac-Lys-14-histone H3 in dendritic cells treated with zymosan upon coimmunoprecipitation of transducin-like enhancer of split. In contrast, we did not obtain evidence of a possible effect of SIRT1 through the deacetylation of c-Rel, the central element of the NF-κB family involved in il12a regulation. These data indicate that an enhancement of SIRT1 activity in response to phagocytic stimuli may reduce the accessibility of c-Rel to the il12a promoter and its transcriptional activation, thus regulating the IL-12 p70/IL-23 balance and modulating the ongoing immune response. The response of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) 4The abbreviations used are: DCdendritic cellsAMPKAMP-activated kinaseCREBCRE binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinNucnucleosomeRHDRel-homology domainSIRTsirtuinTgtransgenicTLEtransducin-like enhancer of splitPKAccatalytic subunit of PKAAAD3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotideAbantibody. to the fungal surrogate zymosan shows a distinct pattern of production of IL-12 p70 and IL-23, which are involved in the development of the T-helper type 1 and type 17 responses, respectively. IL-12 p70 and IL-23 share a common chain IL-12 p40 (il12/23b) and differ by other chain, IL-12 p35 (il12a) in the case of IL-12 p70 and IL-23 p19 (il23a) in IL-23. Addressing the mechanism of IL-12 p70/IL-23 balance regulation is of clinical relevance, as IL-23 takes part in the defense against pathogens and in the development of autoimmunity (1Abraham C.

Recent studies have shown that zymosan produces cross-inhibition through the transcriptional repressors hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif 1 (HEY1), and the corepressor transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE). Zymosan also modulates the acetylation of lysines in histones, thereby modifying the accessibility of transcription factors to the il12a promoter (12Alvarez Y. Municio C. Hugo E. Zhu J. Alonso S.

This molecular mechanism is of clinical relevance because inhibition with the synthetic acetyl-histone mimic i-BET of interactions between acetylated histones and the bromodomains of proteins involved in transcriptional activation is a promising therapy in bacteria-induced sepsis.

The cellular NAD+ levels have been considered the primary mechanism regulating SIRT1 activity, although a recent report has stressed cyclic AMP-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-434 as a key event in the regulation of its activity independently of changes in NAD+ levels (26Gerhart-Hines Z.

In this study we have observed changes in the nuclear concentrations of NAD+, an increase of SIRT1 protein associated with the il12a promoter, and a correlation of SIRT1 activity with the inhibition of il12a transcription during the activation of DC by zymosan. After having analyzed acetylation/deacetylation reactions of NF-κB and histone proteins, we propose that the inhibition of il12a transcription elicited by zymosan is best explained by an increase of SIRT1 activity linked to an enhanced expression of the protein, an increased disposal of its co-substrate NAD+, and the ensuing deacetylation of histones. Zymosan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, LPS, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc) were from Sigma. IL-12 p70 was assayed by ELISA (Thermo Scientific Pierce). A-769662, a reversible activator of AMPK, was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). 3-Aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide (AAD), a NAD+ analog that increases the cellular concentration of NAD+ by inhibiting dehydrogenases (27Fisher T.L.

Cycling conditions were adapted to each set of primers. gapdh was used as a housekeeping gene to assess the relative abundance of the different mRNA using the comparative cycle threshold method. The sequences of the primers are shown in supplemental Methods. To quantify Nuc remodeling at the il12a promoter, chromatin accessibility was measured by a real-time PCR (CHART-PCR) assay. About 5 × 106 DC were washed in ice-cold PBS, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine, pH 7.5), and incubated on ice for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged to pellet the nuclei and resuspended in a buffer suitable for nuclease digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Nuclei were digested with 50 units of BstXI or 50 units PshAI for 1 h at 37 °C. After treatment with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, reactions were stopped by treatment with 1 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 37 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and 150 ng of genomic DNA were used to perform SYBR Green quantitative PCR with triplicate samples. Nuc-1 and -2 of the il12a promoter have cleavage sites for restriction enzymes PshAI (located at nucleotide −69) and BstXI (located at nucleotide −298). Increased accessibility of the chromatin would result in an increased digestion of Nuc by the enzymes and thus a reduced amplification in the quantitative PCR. To normalize for DNA input amounts, each sample was analyzed with primers for cyclooxygenase-2 (ptgs2) promoter, a unique sequence in genome that is not digested by the restriction enzymes used in the assays. Results are expressed as a percentage of the undigested sample for each cell treatment using the formula (Ntno E − NtE/Ntno E) × 100%, with Nt = 2Ct(primer Pr ptgs) − Ct(primer Nuc). The sequence of the primers is shown in supplemental Methods. Intracellular NAD+ concentrations were determined by an enzymatic cycling assay (30Van Gool F. Gallí M. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Prevot P.P.

The remaining cells were eliminated by centrifugation, and the nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in hypertonic medium (20 mm Hepes, 25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm PMSF, pH 7.9) for 10 min on ice. Chromatin was pelleted at 90,000 × g for 30 min. The cytosols, and nuclear extracts were treated with 250 mm HCl for 20 min to destroy NADH and then neutralized by adding 250 mm NaOH. Samples were mixed with cycling buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, 1.25 mm phenazine methosulfate, 0.625 mm thiazolyl blue/methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and 15 units alcohol dehydrogenase, pH 8.8. Optical density at 570 nm was measured as the blank, and then the cycling reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl of ethanol 6 m. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and the optical density was measured at 570 nm after 5, 10, 15, and 20 min using an ELISA plate reader. The blank values were subtracted from all A570 nm for concentration analysis. Cellular NAD+ levels of unknown samples were calculated from the standard curve of serial known dilutions of NAD+. NAD+ values were normalized against protein levels and are presented as nmol NAD+/mg of protein compared with control. c-Rel, the Rel-homology domain (RHD) of human c-Rel1–309, and the mutant Ser-267-Ala were constructed by PCR from a full-length c-Rel cDNA construct provided by Dr. Tse-Ha Tan (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and fused in phase to the N-terminal histidine tag using SalI-NotI sites of a pET-28a vector (12Alvarez Y.

Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). His-tag proteins were purified with nickel beads and used for in vitro kinase assays. GST-tag proteins were purified with glutathione-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow GST-nickel beads (GE Healthcare) and the GST tag cleaved from the fusion protein by digestion with thrombin and separated from thrombin by incubation with benzamidine-SepharoseTM 4 beads (GE Healthcare). A 1-μg aliquot of substrate proteins was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in reaction buffer: 12 mm MOPS/NaOH, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% glycerol, 0.01 Brij-35, and 0.1 mg of BSA containing 15 ng of PKAc and supplemented with 10 mm Mg(Ac)2 and 20 μm ATP, pH 7. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and the phosphorylated substrate proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE in 15% acrylamide. Phosphorylation of RelA/p65 and c-Rel was assayed by Western blot using anti-Ser(P)-276-RelA/p65-phosphospecific antibody. Ab reactive to the N-terminal domain of c-Rel and RelA/p65 (Cell Signaling #3034S) was used in assays where both proteins were used. 1 μg of recombinant histone H3, RelA/p65, or c-Rel was incubated with 200 ng of recombinant p300 or pCAF in lysine acetyltransferase buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 200 μm acetyl-CoA, pH 8). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and heating at 97 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot. Deacetylase assays were performed after inhibition of the activities of lysine acetyltransferases with 30 μm garcinol. Thereafter, 1 μg of acetylated proteins was incubated with 100 ng of recombinant SIRT1 in deacetylase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 250 mm NAD+, pH 8) at 37 °C for 1 h. Reaction mixtures were subsequently analyzed by Western blot. ChIP assays were conducted with reagents and Ab against SIRT1 (Santa Cruz sc-15404) and anti-SIRT6 from Abcam plc (Cambridge, UK) as previously reported (31Alvarez Y. Municio C. Alonso S. Sánchez Crespo M. Fernández N. The induction of IL-10 by fungi in dendritic cells depends on CREB activation by the coactivators CBP and TORC2 and autocrine PGE2.J.

Nuc-1 was reconstituted in vitro using the EpiMarkTM Nucleosome Assembly kit (New England Biolabs) according to the dilution assembly protocol. For this purpose, purified recombinant human histone H2A/H2B dimer and histone H3.1/H4 tetramer were mixed with a DNA substrate encoding Nuc-1 constructed by PCR with the primers used for the assay of chromatin accessibility of Nuc-1 of the il12a promoter. The salt concentration was diluted to allow each histone tetramer to associate with two histone dimers and form the histone octamer on the DNA. Reconstituted Nuc were subjected to phosphorylation and/or acetylation assays before performing the binding reactions between the Nuc and transcription factors. To assess the binding of NF-κB proteins to the Nuc, sequential ChIP was conducted using in the first step anti-histone H3 Ab. The immunoprecipitate was dissolved in 100 μl of 10 mm DTT to break apart the Ab chains, and then the final concentration of DTT diluted 40-fold. Ab reactive to the N-terminal domain of c-Rel and RelA/p65 was added and incubated overnight in a rotating shaker. After a new round of immunoprecipitation, a real time-PCR was carried with il12a promoter Nuc-1 primers. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were used for immunodetection of c-Rel (C-terminal, Santa Cruz sc-71), c-Rel (N-terminal, Santa Cruz sc-70), RelA/p65 (N-terminal, #06–418), histone H3 (#05-928), Ac-histone H3 (# 05-928), Ac-Lys-14-histone H3 (#07-353), and Ser(P)-10-histone H3 (#04-817) with Ab from Upstate Biotechnology. Ser(P)-276-RelA (#3031), Ac-Lys (#9441), Ac-Lys-310-RelA (#3045), AMPKα (#2532), and phospho-AMPKα (#2535) were assayed with Ab from Cell Signaling Technology.

For immunoblots directed to assay nuclear proteins, the nuclear extracts were obtained by using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif). Pulldown assays of the RHD of both RelA and c-Rel were carried out with biotinylated probes from the proximal κB site of human il12a promoter (supplemental Methods) and recombinant proteins, both acetylated in vitro and left untreated. The binding reactions were carried out with 5 μg of hybridized probe, 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads, 96 μl of acetylation buffer 5×, and different concentrations of recombinant RHD in a final volume of 500 μl. The incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature in a rotating shaker. Samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 30 s, and the pellet was washed 4 times with PBS. The pulled down mixture was resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and developed in a 12% SDS/PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the proteins were identified with Ab reactive to the N-terminal domain of c-Rel and RelA/p65, anti-Ac-Lys-310-RelA, and anti-Ac-Lys. Based on our previous findings suggesting that the sirtuin inhibitor EX-527 diminished the inhibitory effect of zymosan on the production of IL-12 p70 elicited by the combination of LPS and IFNγ, we tested whether activation of sirtuin activity with SRT1720 influenced IL-12 p70 in an opposite way. As shown in Fig. 1A, SRT1720 enhanced the inhibitory effect of zymosan on the production of IL-12 p70 elicited by LPS plus IFNγ when used at 10 μm, which most likely reflects the difficulty of obtaining a greater level of inhibition upon that elicited by zymosan. Because SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase dependent on NAD+, this nucleotide was assayed in DC. As shown in Fig. 1B, zymosan induced a robust increase of NAD+ levels in the nuclear fractions, whereas the concentration in the cytoplasm did not show significant change after stimulation. Because these results were consistent with an effect of SIRT1 on the regulation of IL-12 p70, we went on to address the expression of SIRT1 after stimulation of DC. As shown in Fig. 2A, zymosan induced a rapid appearance of SIRT1 protein in the nuclear fractions that persisted for at least 5 h, whereas only minor amounts of the protein were detected in the cytoplasm (not shown), thus agreeing with the preferential nuclear location of SIRT1. This was not observed after stimulation with LPS and IFNγ, which is in keeping with the reported inhibition of SIRT1 expression by these stimuli (33Li P. Zhao Y. Wu X. Xia M. Fang M. Iwasaki Y.

Abnormal modifications have often been observed in the aggregated proteins, supporting the aggregation mechanism regulated by post-translational modifications on proteins. Modifications are in general assumed to occur in soluble proteins before aggregation, but actually it remains quite obscure when proteins are modified in the course of the aggregation. Here we focus upon aggregation of huntingtin (HTT), which causes a neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington disease, and we show that oxidation of a methionine residue in HTT occurs in vitro and also in vivo. Copper ions as well as added hydrogen peroxide are found to oxidize the methionine residue, but notably, this oxidative modification occurs only in the aggregated HTT but not in the soluble state. Furthermore, the methionine oxidation creates additional interactions among HTT aggregates and alters overall morphologies of the aggregates. We thus reveal that protein aggregates can be a target of oxidative modifications and propose that such a “post-aggregation” modification is a relevant factor to regulate properties of protein aggregates.

Different mutations give rise to phenotypically distinct corneal dystrophies. Most mutations are located in the fourth fasciclin-1 domain (FAS1–4). The amino acid substitution A546T in the FAS1–4 domain is linked to the development of lattice corneal dystrophy with amyloid deposits in the superficial and deep stroma, classifying it as an amyloid disease. Here we provide a detailed description of the fibrillation of the isolated FAS1–4 domain carrying the A546T substitution. The A546T substitution leads to a significant destabilization of FAS1–4 and induces a partially folded structure with increased surface exposure of hydrophobic patches. The mutation also leads to two distinct fibril morphologies. Long straight fibrils composed of pure β-sheet structure are formed at lower concentrations, whereas short and curly fibrils containing a mixture of α-helical and β-sheet structures are formed at higher concentrations. The formation of short and curly fibrils is preceded by the formation of a small number of oligomeric species with high membrane permeabilization potential and rapid fibril formation. The long straight fibrils are formed more slowly and through progressively bigger oligomers that lose their membrane permeabilization potential as fibrillation proceeds beyond the lag phase.

More than 30 different mutations in TGFBIp resulting in corneal dystrophies have been identified. Prominent among these are two mutational hotspots, namely Arg-124 and Arg-555 (7Kannabiran C.

The remaining mutations causing TGFBIp-linked corneal dystrophy are all in the fourth FAS1 domain (FAS1–4) (7Kannabiran C. Klintworth G.K. TGFBI gene mutations in corneal dystrophies.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The stability of full-length TGFBIp is mirrored by FAS1–4; destabilizing mutations in FAS1–4 destabilize the full-length protein to a comparable degree (19Runager K. Basaiawmoit R.V. Deva T. Andreasen M. Valnickova Z. Sørensen C.S. Karring H. Thøgersen I.B. Christiansen G. Underhaug J. Kristensen T. Nielsen N.C. Klintworth G.K. Otzen D.E. Enghild J.J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, FAS1–4 can be considered a good model system for full-length TGFBIp. TGFBIp is the major part of the protein inclusions found in the cornea, and abnormal protein turnover of the protein is associated with various mutations (20Streeten B.W. Qi Y. Klintworth G.K. Eagle Jr., R.C. Strauss J.A. Bennett K. Immunolocalization of β ig-h3 protein in 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies and normal corneas.Arch.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11465-11469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, no deposits of TGFBIp aggregates have been observed elsewhere in the human body. This has been suggested to be linked to the slow turnover of proteins in the cornea due to a lack of blood vessels (22Beebe D.C. Maintaining transparency. A review of the developmental physiology and pathophysiology of two avascular tissues.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 19: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a C-terminal fragment of TGFBIp derived from FAS1–4 has been found to accumulate in amyloids of the mutant V624M, forming lattice-type deposits in the cornea (23Karring H. Runager K. Thøgersen I.B. Klintworth G.K. Højrup P. Enghild J.J. Composition and proteolytic processing of corneal deposits associated with mutations in the TGFBI gene.Exp. Eye Res. 2012; 96: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The molecular events leading to protein aggregation and accumulation involved in corneal dystrophy are still unclear. The large variety of mutations in TGFBIp leading to different forms of corneal dystrophies indicates that TGFBIp may aggregate in a number of different ways. To probe this aggregate variability in more detail, we present a biophysical analysis of the aggregation of the FAS1–4 domain containing the naturally occurring disease-promoting amino acid substitution A546T. This mutation results in lattice corneal dystrophy with amyloid deposits in the superficial and deep stroma and has an age of onset of 35–40 years (24Dighiero P. Drunat S. Ellies P. D'Hermies F. Savoldelli M. Legeais J.M. Renard G. Delpech M. Grateau G. Valleix S. A new mutation (A546T) of the β ig-h3 gene responsible for a French lattice corneal dystrophy type IIIA.Am. J. Ophthalmol. 2000; 129: 248-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We show that the A546T substitution, already known to destabilize FAS1–4 (19Runager K. Basaiawmoit R.V. Deva T. Andreasen M. Valnickova Z. Sørensen C.S. Karring H. Thøgersen I.B. Christiansen G. Underhaug J. Kristensen T. Nielsen N.C. Klintworth G.K. Otzen D.E. Enghild J.J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), leads to an increase in surface exposure of hydrophobic patches. The mutation also leads to the formation of two distinct fibril morphologies, namely long straight fibrils with pure β-sheet structure (formed at lower concentrations) and short and curly fibrils with a mixture of α-helical and β-sheet structures (formed at higher concentrations). Different oligomeric intermediates displaying different membrane permeabilization potential accumulate during the two distinct fibrillation pathways. We suggest the different oligomeric states found under the two different conditions give rise to the different fibril types. The complexity of the aggregation process induced by a single mutation provides a good indication that TGFBIp has access to a number of different aggregation pathways. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. This work is part of our ongoing efforts to find optimal conditions for preparation of homogeneous fibrils for solid-state NMR elucidation of the molecular structure of these fibrils. Consequently, all fibrillation work in this study was carried out on 13C- and 15N-labeled FAS1–4 A546T. For chemical and thermal stability studies and the analysis of trypsin proteolysis, we used non-labeled FAS1–4 WT as a reference. Non-labeled FAS1–4 A546T was included as a control for the possible effect of using labeled protein instead of non-labeled protein. A546T FAS1–4 (residues 502–657) was cloned into a pET SUMO expression vector as described previously (19Runager K. Basaiawmoit R.V. Deva T. Andreasen M. Valnickova Z. Sørensen C.S. Karring H.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with SUMO-FAS1–4 A546T plasmid (residue 502–657) plated on LB/kanamycin agar and left at 37 °C overnight. 2 ml of LB/kanamycin was inoculated with one colony and incubated overnight. The overnight culture was once again plated out and left at 37 °C overnight. One colony from this plate was used for protein expression in a fermenter after a pilot expression confirmed the expected size and sequence of the protein. 13C,15N-Labeled FAS1–4 A546T was expressed in a fermenter (type C 10–3, from B. Braun Biotech, Mesungen, Germany) in 8 liters of M9 medium using the same BL21(DE3) clone as described above. Protein expression was induced using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at which point M9 medium with d-[13C6]glucose and [15N]NH4Cl as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, was added. Protein expression was allowed to proceed for 10 h, after which cells were harvested by centrifugation. Frozen bacterial pellets from fermenter expression (batches of 10–20 g) were resuspended in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (buffer A), sonicated for 6 × 30 s while on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was then applied to a nickel column (5 ml HiTrap Chelating HP, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A at 1–2 ml/min. The column was then washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A and attached to an Äkta Purifier (GE Healthcare), and bound protein was eluted with imidazole using a stepwise gradient of 500 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (buffer B). Fractions containing SUMO-FAS1–4 fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed against 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, before the fusion protein was cleaved by incubation for 24 h at 16 °C with 2 units/ml SUMO protease. After the cleaved protein was dialyzed against 2 × 5 liters of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, the pure FAS1–4 A546T product was obtained as the flow-through from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Finally, the purified protein was concentrated (YM CentriPrep, molecular weight cutoff 3 kDa) to a stock of 1.5 mg/ml. The protein was fibrillated in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl at 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mg/ml protein. Additional NaCl or heparin was added to different concentrations. Thioflavin T (ThT) was added to the protein solution to a final concentration of 40 μm, and the protein solution was transferred to a 96-well black Costar polystyrene microtiter plate, sealed to prevent evaporation, and placed in an Infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan Nordic AB). When fibril seeds were present, these were added immediately before the plate was sealed. Seeds of preformed fibrils were produced by sonication for 10 s at 30% amplitude with a Bandelin Sonopuls HD 2070 sonication probe (Buch & Holm). The plate was incubated at 37 °C, and the ThT fluorescence (excitation 450 nm, emission 482 nm) was measured every 5 min with 3 min of shaking between each reading. The concentration of FAS1–4 A546T in the supernatant after fibrillation and centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm in a table top centrifuge was analyzed using a Bradford reagent kit (Sigma) with a standard curve of bovine serum albumin according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 0.4 mg/ml protein was incubated with 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 0% trypsin (w/w %) for 30 min at 37 °C and then analyzed by reducing 15% SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie staining and destaining, the gel was scanned, and the intensities of the bands were determined using the software ImageJ. 0.17 mg/ml FAS1–4 was mixed with 10 μm ANS, and the fluorescence emission was measured from 400 to 600 nm with excitation at 365 nm, slit widths of 10 nm, and a scan speed of 200 nm/min on an LS55 luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Three spectra were accumulated and averaged for each sample. Fibril samples were sonicated for 2 s at 60% amplitude with a Bandelin probe before analysis to minimize light scattering (25Ghodke S.

CD wavelength spectra from 250 to 200 nm with a step size of 0.2 nm, bandwidth of 2 nm, and scan speed of 50 nm/min were recorded at 25 °C with a J-810 CD-spectrometer (Jasco) using a 1-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma). Five spectra were averaged for each sample, and the buffer spectra were subtracted.

The obtained data points were fitted as described previously (27Mogensen J.E. Ipsen H. Holm J. Otzen D.E. Elimination of a misfolded folding intermediate by a single point mutation.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using the software KaleidaGraph. FTIR spectroscopy was performed using a Tensor27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with attenuated total reflection accessory with a continuous flow of N2 gas. All samples were dried with N2 gas. 64 interferograms were accumulated at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. Peak positions were assigned where the second order derivative had local minima, and the intensity was modeled by Gaussian curve fitting using the OPUS 5.5 software. 0.17 mg/ml FAS1–4 A546T was mixed with various concentrations of urea and allowed to equilibrate for at least 2 h. A far-UV CD spectrum was acquired, and the data were fitted as described (27Mogensen J.E. Ipsen H. Holm J. Otzen D.E. Elimination of a misfolded folding intermediate by a single point mutation.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using KaleidaGraph 4.0 (GeoMEM Consultants). Aliquots of 5 μl of fibril solution were mounted on 400-mesh carbon-coated, glow-discharged nickel grids for 30 s. The grids were washed with one drop of double distilled water and stained with three drops of 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.2. Samples were inspected in a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope at 60 keV. Images were obtained using an electron sensitive Olympus KeenView CCD camera. The development of individual aggregation species during the course of FAS1–4 A546T fibrillations at 0.4 and 1.2 mg/ml was monitored using a Postnova AF2000 asymmetrical AF4 system (Postnova Analytics GmbH) consisting of two HPLC pumps, a AF2000 focus and separation unit equipped with a 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration membrane, and a 350-μm spacer defining the trapezoidal shape of the separation channel, a S3240 UV-visible detector set at a wave length of 205 nm, and a PN3140 refractive index detector. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min before analysis to remove insoluble material. 60 μg of FAS1–4 (50 μl of 1.2 mg/ml or 150 μl of 0.4 mg/ml) was injected using a glass syringe into an appropriate sample loop mounted in a Rheodyne injection port. The sample was injected and separated in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl using the following flow program modified from Lorenzen et al. (28Lorenzen N. Cohen S.I. Nielsen S.B. Herling T.W. Christiansen G. Dobson C.M. Knowles T.P. Otzen D. Role of elongation and secondary pathways in s6 amyloid fibril growth.Biophys. J. 2012; 102: 2167-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A constant detector/outlet flow of 0.5 ml/min was maintained throughout the separation: 1) sample loading using an injection/tip flow of 0.2 ml/min, cross-flow of 2.5 ml/min, and focus flow of 2.8 ml/min; 2) a 1-min linear gradient to 3 ml/min tip-flow and 2.5 ml/min cross-flow (initiation of elution); 3) isocratic elution of low Mr species (e.g. FAS1–4 monomer, dimer, and trimer) at 3 ml/min tip-flow and 2.5 ml/min cross-flow; 4) a 25-min linear cross-flow gradient to 0.25 ml/min; 5) a 15-min linear cross-flow gradient to 0 ml/min (field release; no separation); 6) a 10-min washing/rinsing step at 0 ml/min cross-flow. The concentration of eluting species was monitored by absorbance at 205 nm because of the low content of aromatic residues in FAS1–4 (precluding the use of absorption at 280 nm) and artifacts from the refractive index signals generated when applying the cross-flow gradients. The correlation between the retention time and the apparent molecular weight was approximated based on a calibration curve made with ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29/58 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669/1338 kDa) (all from GE Healthcare gel filtration low and high molecular weight calibration kits) by plotting the retention time against the molecular weight. Calcein vesicles were prepared by dissolving 5 mg/ml lipids of either 100% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-[phosphor-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DOPG), 100% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DOPC), or 50% DOPG:50% DOPC in chloroform. Chloroform was evaporated, and the lipids were dissolved in 70 μm calcein, 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, and 20 mm NaCl. The lipids were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed to produce unilamellar vesicles. The lipid vesicles were extruded through a 100-μm filter (Avanti Polar Lipids) to ensure a uniform size of the vesicles. 600 μl of calcein vesicles were eluted with 1.5 ml 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, and 20 mm NaCl from a PD10 desalting column equilibrated in 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl. Samples removed from fibrillating FAS1–4 A546T at 1.2 and 0.4 mg/ml 0.001% heparin were centrifuged at 13,000 × g in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the sample was diluted to 0.02 mg/ml protein by the addition of 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl. Nine additional steps of 2-fold dilutions were prepared. 150 μl of each dilution was transferred to a 96-well black Costar polystyrene microtiter plate. The plate was placed in an Infinite M200 plate reader at 37 °C. The fluorescence with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm was measured with 5 s of shaking between each read. After 10 min the plate was removed, and 2 μl of 5 mg/ml lipid calcein vesicles were added. The plate was placed in the Infinite M200 plate reader at 37 °C. Fluorescence emission intensity (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm) was recorded with 5 s of shaking between each read. After ∼1 h, the plate was removed, and 2 μl of 2% Triton X-100 was added to each well to allow complete lysis of vesicles followed by emission recording as above. We initially compared the stability of the non-fibrillated FAS1–4 A546T relative to FAS1–4 WT by monitoring chemical and thermal unfolding by CD spectroscopy. This was done by following the changes in the intensity at 222 nm as a function of either chemical denaturant concentration or temperature. FAS1–4 A546T was less stable than FAS1–4 WT both with regard to chemical and thermal denaturation (Fig. 1, A and B). Melting temperatures (Tm) were 52.3 °C for FAS1–4 A546T versus 66.8 °C for WT, whereas the midpoints of denaturation ([urea]50%) were 1.78 and 3.07 m urea for A546T and WT, respectively (Table 1). The free energy of unfolding (ΔGD-N) of A546T are less than half that of WT, consistent with results previously obtained for unlabeled FAS1–4 mutants (19Runager K. Basaiawmoit R.V. Deva T. Andreasen M. Valnickova Z. Sørensen C.S. Karring H. Thøgersen I.B. Christiansen G. Underhaug J. Kristensen T. Nielsen N.C. Klintworth G.K. Otzen D.E. Enghild J.J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, as expected, isotopic labeling of FAS1–4 does not change protein stability. The α-helical and β-sheet contributions to the secondary structure of FAS1–4 WT and A546T were estimated by spectral deconvolution of the far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 1A, inset) using the K2d algorithm (29Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Evaluation of secondary structure of proteins from UV circular dichroism spectra using an unsupervised learning neural network.Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The β-sheet content of both FAS1–4 WT and A546T was estimated to be 16%, whereas the α-helical contribution was estimated to be 28% for WT and 27% for A546T. This distribution correlates with what has previously been reported for Fas1–4 (10Clout N.J. Tisi D. Hohenester E. Novel fold revealed by the structure of a FAS1 domain pair from the insect cell adhesion molecule fasciclin I.Structure. 2003; 11: 197-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We conclude that the labeling and the amino acid substitution do not change the structure of the monomeric protein (19Runager K. Basaiawmoit R.V. Deva T. Andreasen M. Valnickova Z. Sørensen C.S.

Here, we examine whether this activity of RNase BN also functions in vivo. Comparison of the x-ray structure of RNase BN with that of Bacillus subtilis RNase Z, which lacks exoribonuclease activity, revealed that RNase BN has a narrower and more rigid channel downstream of the catalytic site. We hypothesized that this difference in the putative RNA exit channel might be responsible for the acquisition of exoribonuclease activity by RNase BN. Accordingly, we generated several mutant RNase BN proteins in which residues within a loop in this channel were converted to the corresponding residues present in B. subtilis RNase Z, thus widening the channel and increasing its flexibility. The resulting mutant RNase BN proteins had reduced or were essentially devoid of exoribonuclease activity in vitro. Substitution of one mutant rbn gene (P142G) for wild type rbn in the E. coli chromosome revealed that the exoribonuclease activity of RNase BN is not required for maturation of phage T4 tRNA precursors, a known specific function of this RNase. On the other hand, removal of the exoribonuclease activity of RNase BN in a cell lacking other processing RNases leads to slower growth and affects maturation of multiple tRNA precursors.

The biosynthesis of a mature, functional tRNA requires a series of processing steps in which both 5′-leader and 3′-trailer sequences are removed. The 5′-leader sequence is removed by the universal endoribonuclease, RNase P. However, processing of the 3′-trailer sequence differs among organisms (1Deutscher M.P.

In those organisms in which tRNA precursors are devoid of a 3′-CCA sequence, such as eukaryotes, a single endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase Z at the discriminator nucleotide generates a substrate for CCA addition (5Pellegrini O.

In contrast, in those organisms, such as Escherichia coli, in which the CCA sequence is already present in the tRNA precursors, exonucleolytic trimming generates the mature tRNA (3Li Z.

Multiple exoribonucleases are required for the 3′ processing of Escherichia coli tRNA precursors in vivo.FASEB J. 1993; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of RNase Z would appear to be unnecessary in E. coli. Surprisingly, however, an RNase Z homologue, termed RNase BN, is present (11Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J.

Identification and partial characterization of a new tRNA processing enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it is of considerable interest to understand what the function of RNase BN might be. RNase BN was originally found to be required for the maturation of those T4 tRNA precursors that lacked a CCA sequence at their 3′ terminus (14Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. A mutant of Escherichia coli defective in removing 3′-terminal nucleotides from some transfer RNA precursor molecules.Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that it is also able to mature CCA-encoded E. coli tRNA precursors when all other processing exoribonucleases are absent, although it is very inefficient in this regard (3Li Z.

A random multienzyme process in vivo.Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P.

Deutscher M.P. The presence of only one of five exoribonucleases is sufficient to support the growth of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of the gene encoding RNase BN (rbn) in E. coli has no effect on cell growth, and it has even been reported that cells lacking RNase BN do not show any alteration in their transcriptome or proteome profile (16Schilling O. Rüggeberg S. Vogel A. Rittner N. Weichert S. Schmidt S. Doig S. Franz T. Benes V. Andrews S.C. Baum M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Characterization of an Escherichia coli elaC deletion mutant.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although this remains controversial (17Perwez T. Kushner S.R. RNase Z in Escherichia coli plays a significant role in mRNA decay.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, under normal circumstances, RNase BN is unlikely to be involved in tRNA maturation in vivo except in bacteriophage T4-infected cells (13Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Ribonuclease BN. Identification and partial characterization of a new tRNA processing enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RNase BN was initially reported to be an exoribonuclease based on its ability to remove a mononucleotide residue from the 3′ terminus of certain synthetic tRNA precursors (13Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Ribonuclease BN. Identification and partial characterization of a new tRNA processing enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in contrast to other members of the RNase Z family, which act as endoribonucleases. However, in a recent study, we showed that RNase BN is both a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease on model RNA substrates (18Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Catalytic properties of RNase BN/RNase Z from Escherichia coli. RNase BN is both an exo- and endoribonuclease.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is strongly inhibited by the presence of a CCA sequence or a phosphoryl group at the 3′-end of RNA (18Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Catalytic properties of RNase BN/RNase Z from Escherichia coli. RNase BN is both an exo- and endoribonuclease.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mode of action of RNase BN on tRNA precursors differs based on whether or not the universal 3′-terminal CCA sequence is present. It acts as an endoribonuclease on tRNA precursors that lack a CCA sequence, cleaving after the discriminator nucleotide. In contrast, maturation of tRNA precursors containing a CCA sequence is dependent on the metal ion present; exoribonuclease activity is favored in the presence of Co2+, whereas endoribonuclease activity is stimulated by Mg2+ (19Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Mode of action of RNase BN/RNase Z on tRNA precursors. RNase BN does not remove the CCA sequence from tRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22874-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). RNase BN cleaves after the CCA sequence in its endoribonucleolytic mode, and it trims off extra 3′ residues up to the CCA sequence when acting as an exoribonuclease. In neither case does it remove the CCA sequence from tRNA (19Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Mode of action of RNase BN/RNase Z on tRNA precursors. RNase BN does not remove the CCA sequence from tRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22874-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no other member of the RNase Z family has been reported to have an exoribonuclease activity in addition to the known endoribonuclease activity. However, the mechanism responsible for the dual activities of RNase BN has not been elucidated. Most importantly, it is not known whether the exoribonuclease activity actually functions in vivo or whether it is simply an in vitro manifestation. In this study, we identified a structural feature in RNase BN that differs from its RNase Z homologue in Bacillus subtilis. Based on this analysis, we were able to generate a mutant form of RNase BN that lacks almost all exoribonuclease activity but retains its endoribonuclease activity. Expression of this mutant protein in place of wild type RNase BN in E. coli had no obvious effect on wild type cells. However, in cells lacking certain other exoribonucleases and dependent on RNase BN for growth, the presence of the mutant form of RNase BN resulted in even slower growth and affected processing of tRNA precursors. On the other hand, maturation of phage T4 tRNA precursors was unaffected. Biochemical analysis revealed that maturation of the phage T4 tRNA precursors depended solely on the endonucleolytic activity of RNase BN, whereas maturation of host tRNA precursors utilized both activities. Moreover, we found that the endoribonuclease activity of RNase BN cleaved tRNA precursors after the CCA sequence, confirming earlier in vitro findings (19Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Mode of action of RNase BN/RNase Z on tRNA precursors. RNase BN does not remove the CCA sequence from tRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22874-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data indicate that both the exo- and endoribonuclease activities of RNase BN can function in vivo and thereby expand the possible roles for this enzyme in E. coli. T4 RNA ligase, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, NucwayTM spin columns, and the MEGAshortscriptTM kit were purchased from Ambion Inc.

The mutation P142G was introduced into a plasmid-encoded rbn gene by site-directed mutagenesis using primers D1 and D2 (supplemental Table S1). KOD hot start DNA polymerase was used in the PCR. A template plasmid containing the wild type rbn gene was then digested by DpnI treatment at 37 °C for 2 h. Mutant rbn-containing plasmids were purified by gel extraction using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)I−II−. Mutations of P142Q and L143V were also introduced into a plasmid-encoded rbn gene in the same manner using primers P1 and P2 (for P142Q) and R1 and R2 (for L143V) (supplemental Table S1). Mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)I−II−/pLys and purified using the same procedure used previously for purification of wild type His-tagged RNase BN (12Ezraty B.

The purity of wild type and mutant RNase BN proteins was determined on an overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gel (∼3.0 μg of the purified protein). For all of the proteins, a single band at ∼35 kDa was observed without any detectable minor contaminating bands. Wild type E. coli K-12 strain MG1655(Seq)rph+ was obtained from laboratory stock, and its derivative MG1655(Seq)rph+mutS− was a gift from Dr. Richard Myers (University of Miami). Deletions of the genes encoding RNase I, II, D, or T were introduced into strain MG1655, which is RNase PH−, by transduction with phage P1vir. Mutagenesis of proline 142 to glycine of RNase BN in strain MG1655(Seq)rph+mutS− was performed by recombineering using oligonucleotide B1 (supplemental Table S1) (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L.

Recombinants were selected by PCR using primers T1 and T2 (supplemental Table S1). A kanamycin resistance gene was also introduced by recombineering after the terminator sequence of the chromosomal rbn gene (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11176) Google Scholar). The mutant rbn gene along with the adjacent kanamycin resistance marker from strain MG1655(seq)rph+mutS− was introduced into wild type MG1655(seq)rph+ or into MG1655 I−II−D−T−PH−. Each of these strains was then transformed with the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20. The kanamycin resistance gene was then flipped out by activation of the flippase encoded in plasmid, pCP20. The P142G mutation in each strain was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type phage T4 and its mutant derivative BU33 were obtained from laboratory stock. BU33 contains an amber mutation in its head protein and a suppressor function for tRNASer as described (14Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H.

A cca mutation containing the chloramphenicol resistance marker was introduced into strains MG1655 I−II−D− and MG1655 I−II−D− P142G by transduction with phage P1vir. The rnt mutant gene was subsequently introduced into these strains by P1 transduction. Cells were grown in YT medium at 37 °C. Antibiotics were at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 34 μg/ml. E. coli and phage T4 tRNA precursors were synthesized from DNA templates of tRNA genes in in vitro transcription reactions using the MEGAshortscriptTM transcription kit as described previously (19Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Mode of action of RNase BN/RNase Z on tRNA precursors. RNase BN does not remove the CCA sequence from tRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22874-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All templates were synthesized from genomic DNAs by PCR with the forward primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. PCR products were purified using the GeneEluteTM PCR clean-up kit. Precursor tRNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) extraction followed by ethanol precipitation as described. 5′-[32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase were used to label the 3′-end of tRNA precursors in the presence of unlabeled ATP at 4 °C for 16 h as described previously. Unincorporated 5′-[32P]pCp was removed using a NucwayTM spin column, and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase was used to remove the 3′-terminal phosphate from 3′-[32P]pCp-labeled tRNAs. Upon dephosphorylation, 3′-end-labeled tRNAs were purified as described (19Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Mode of action of RNase BN/RNase Z on tRNA precursors.

Portions were taken at the indicated times, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 volumes of gel loading buffer (90% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). Reaction products were resolved on 20% denaturing 7.5 m urea polyacrylamide gels and visualized using a STORM 840 phosphorimaging device (GE Healthcare). ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) was used to quantitate the bands. Bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate was used as substrate to determine the phosphodiesterase activity of RNase BN. Standard reaction conditions were 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm substrate, 2.0 μg of purified His-tagged wild type or mutant RNase BN, and 5 mm MgCl2. Release of p-nitrophenol (ϵ = 11,500 m−1 cm−1 at pH 7.4) was continuously monitored for 3 min at 405 nm. One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol liberated/min at 37 °C. Fifty microliters of overnight culture of wild type or mutant E. coli cells were incubated with 10 μl of either bacteriophage T4 or T4 mutant strain BU33 (108 plaque-forming units/μl) at 37 °C for 5 min. The suspension was then overlaid onto LB plates with 2.5 ml of top agar. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C prior to counting plaques. Cells were grown in YT medium to an A600 of ∼1.0. Total cellular RNA was isolated by phenol extraction as described (24Li Z. Deutscher M.P. The tRNA processing enzyme RNase T is essential for maturation of 5S RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RNA samples from wild type and mutant strains, containing the same amount of RNA, were dissolved in gel loading buffer and loaded on a 6% denaturing 7.5 m urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The gel was run at 1000 V until the xylene cyanol dye had migrated ∼30 cm. The RNA was transferred to a GeneScreen plus membrane by horizontal transfer for 1.5 h at 150 mA using 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA as the transfer solution. T4 polynucleotide kinase was used to prepare a 5′-32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe complementary to the 5′-end of the tRNA. Hybridization of the probe to the transferred RNA was carried out by overnight incubation in ExpressHyb hybridization solution, and the detected bands were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (GE Healthcare). In earlier work (18Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. Catalytic properties of RNase BN/RNase Z from Escherichia coli. RNase BN is both an exo- and endoribonuclease.J. Biol.

RNase BN does not remove the CCA sequence from tRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22874-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we showed that RNase BN can mature E. coli tRNA precursors in vitro using either an exo- or endoribonucleolytic mode of action. However, it has been unclear how the enzyme carries out this dual mode of action. It is also not known whether both activities actually function in vivo. Because the ability of RNase BN to function as both an exo- and an endoribonuclease differs from other members of the RNase Z family, we reasoned that comparison of RNase BN with another RNase Z member might shed light on the explanation for their different catalytic properties. The crystal structures of E. coli RNase BN and its B. subtilis homologue (RNase Z) have been solved (25Li de la Sierra-Gallay I. Pellegrini O. Condon C.

Each enzyme is a dimer containing a core zinc-dependent β-lactamase domain with a HXHXDH metal binding motif as well as additional His and Asp residues that contribute coordination sites to the metal ions. Each of the subunits possesses a protruding flexible arm that is believed to have a role in tRNA binding (25Li de la Sierra-Gallay I. Pellegrini O. Condon C.

Both subunits of RNase BN from E. coli appear to be identical, whereas those of B. subtilis RNase Z maintain a different conformation despite having identical sequences (25Li de la Sierra-Gallay I.

To identify structural differences between the E. coli and B. subtilis proteins that might account for their catalytic differences, we superimposed their crystal structures as shown in Fig. 1. The region encompassing the two metal binding sites, the putative site of catalysis, also contains an RNA-binding channel (9Redko Y. Li de la Sierra-Gallay I. Condon C. When all's zed and done. The structure and function of RNase Z in prokaryotes.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Li de la Sierra-Gallay I. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Structure of the ubiquitous 3′ processing enzyme RNase Z bound to transfer RNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RNA bound in this channel is presumed to be cleaved at the site of metal binding. The cleavage product would then diffuse away through the putative exit channel, which is the portion of the RNA-binding channel that lies downstream of the catalytic site and through which the cleavage product will leave the enzyme. For endonucleolytic cleavage, we propose that the RNA molecule would lie in the RNA binding channel in a manner such that its 3′-end extends well into the exit channel. As a consequence, the catalytic site would access and cleave an internal phosphodiester bond. On the other hand, if the 3′-end of the RNA cannot extend beyond the catalytic site, exonucleolytic cleavage of the terminal 3′-nucleotide would be favored. Thus, we suggest that the position of the RNA substrate, determined by the extent of its entry into the putative exit channel, would result in either endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic action on the RNA chain. Structural features that impede or promote RNA access into the exit channel would thereby favor one or the other cat"
https://openalex.org/W1989603729,"Nucleophosmin (NPM), a ubiquitously and abundantly expressed protein, occurs in the nucleolus, shuttling between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The NPM gene is mutated in almost 30% of human acute myeloid leukemia cells. NPM interacts with p53 and p19Arf, directs localization of p19Arf in the nucleolus and protects the latter from degradation. Hepatocyte odd protein shuttling (HOPS) is also a ubiquitously expressed protein that moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Within the nucleus of resting cells, HOPS overexpression causes cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. HOPS knockdown causes centrosome hyperamplification leading to multinucleated cells and the formation of micronuclei. We demonstrate a direct interaction of HOPS with NPM and p19Arf, resulting in a functionally active trimeric complex. NPM appeared to regulate HOPS half-life, which, in turn, stabilized p19Arf and controlled its localization in the nucleolus. These findings suggest that HOPS acts as a functional bridge in the interaction between NPM and p19Arf, providing new mechanistic insight into how NPM and p19Arf will oppose tumor cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2071311021,"The specific ablation of Rb1 gene in epidermis (Rb(F/F);K14cre) promotes proliferation and altered differentiation but does not produce spontaneous tumour development. These phenotypic changes are associated with increased expression of E2F members and E2F-dependent transcriptional activity. Here, we have focused on the possible dependence on E2F1 gene function. We have generated mice that lack Rb1 in epidermis in an inducible manner (Rb(F/F);K14creER(TM)). These mice are indistinguishable from those lacking pRb in this tissue in a constitutive manner (Rb(F/F);K14cre). In an E2F1-null background (Rb(F/F);K14creER(TM); and E2F1(-/-) mice), the phenotype due to acute Rb1 loss is not ameliorated by E2F1 loss, but rather exacerbated, indicating that pRb functions in epidermis do not rely solely on E2F1. On the other hand, Rb(F/F);K14creER(TM);E2F1(-/-) mice develop spontaneous epidermal tumours of hair follicle origin with high incidence. These tumours, which retain a functional p19(arf)/p53 axis, also show aberrant activation of β-catenin/Wnt pathway. Gene expression studies revealed that these tumours display relevant similarities with specific human tumours. These data demonstrate that the Rb/E2F1 axis exerts essential functions not only in maintaining epidermal homoeostasis, but also in suppressing tumour development in epidermis, and that the disruption of this pathway may induce tumour progression through specific alteration of developmental programs."
