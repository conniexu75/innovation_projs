In “trace” fear conditioning, animals learn to associate a neutral cue with an aversive stimulus despite their separation in time by a delay period on the order of tens of seconds. But how this temporal association forms remains unclear. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging of neural population dynamics throughout the course of learning and show that, in contrast to previous theories, hippocampal CA1 does not generate persistent activity to bridge the delay. Instead, learning is concomitant with broad changes in the active neural population. Although neural responses were stochastic in time, cue identity could be read out from population activity over longer timescales after learning. These results question the ubiquity of seconds-long neural sequences during temporal association learning and suggest that trace fear conditioning relies on mechanisms that differ from persistent activity accounts of working memory.

Episodic memory recapitulates the sequential structure of events that unfold in space and time (Eichenbaum, 2017Eichenbaum H. On the integration of space, time, and memory.Neuron. 2017; 95: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the brain, the hippocampus is critical for binding the representations of discontiguous events (Kitamura et al., 2015Kitamura T. Macdonald C.J. Tonegawa S.

However, it remains a long-standing challenge to track how hippocampal coding is modified as animals learn to associate events separated in time. Pavlovian fear conditioning provides a framework to study the neuronal correlates and mechanisms of associative learning in the brain (Letzkus et al., 2015Letzkus J.J. Wolff S.B. Lüthi A.

Classical “trace” fear conditioning (tFC) has long been used as a model behavior for studying temporal association learning (Raybuck and Lattal, 2014Raybuck J.D. Lattal K.M.

Tonegawa S. Entorhinal-hippocampal neuronal circuits bridge temporally discontiguous events.Learn. Mem. 2015; 22: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Subjects learn that a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) predicts an aversive, unconditioned stimulus (US), which follows the CS by a considerable time delay (“trace” period). Circuitry within the dorsal hippocampus is required for forming these memories at trace intervals on the scale of tens of seconds (Raybuck and Lattal, 2014Raybuck J.D. Lattal K.M.

U S A. 2017; 114: 10262-10267Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, silencing activity in CA1 during the trace period itself is sufficient to disrupt temporal binding of the CS and US in memory (Sellami et al., 2017Sellami A. Al Abed A.S. Brayda-Bruno L. Etchamendy N. Valério S. Oulé M. Pantaléon L. Lamothe V. Potier M. Bernard K. et al.Temporal binding function of dorsal CA1 is critical for declarative memory formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2017; 114: 10262-10267Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although these experiments pinpoint a role for hippocampal activity in forming trace fear memories, the underlying neural dynamics remain unresolved. Importantly, tFC precludes a simple Hebbian association of CS and US selective neural assemblies, because of the non-overlapping presentation of the stimuli. Previous work has proposed that persistent activity enables the hippocampus to connect representations of events in time, bridging time gaps on the order of tens of seconds. Theories suggest that representation of the neutral CS and aversive US are linked through the generation of stereotyped, sequential activity in CA1 (Kitamura et al., 2015Kitamura T. Macdonald C.J. Tonegawa S. Entorhinal-hippocampal neuronal circuits bridge temporally discontiguous events.Learn. Mem. 2015; 22: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Sellami et al., 2017Sellami A.

Alternatively, hippocampal activity could generate a sustained response to the CS that maintains a static coding of the sensory cue in working memory over the trace interval, as in attractor models of neocortical activity (Amit and Brunel, 1997Amit D.J. Brunel N. Model of global spontaneous activity and local structured activity during delay periods in the cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, Barak and Tsodyks, 2014Barak O. Tsodyks M. Working models of working memory.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 25: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008Takehara-Nishiuchi K. McNaughton B.L. Spontaneous changes of neocortical code for associative memory during consolidation.Science. 2008; 322: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and as recently observed in the human hippocampus (Kamiński et al., 2017Kamiński J. Sullivan S. Chung J.M. Ross I.B. Mamelak A.N. Rutishauser U. Persistently active neurons in human medial frontal and medial temporal lobe support working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, these hypotheses of persistent activity remain to be tested during trace fear learning. Here we leveraged two-photon microscopy and functional calcium imaging to record the dynamics of CA1 neural populations longitudinally as animals underwent trace fear learning, in order to resolve the underlying patterns of network activity and their modifications with learning. Our findings show that persistent activity does not manifest strongly during this paradigm, incongruous with sequence or attractor models of temporal association learning. Instead, learning instigated broad changes in network activity and the emergence of a sparse and temporally stochastic code for CS identities that was absent prior to conditioning. These findings suggest that the role of the hippocampus in trace conditioning may be fundamentally different from learning that requires continual maintenance of sensory information in neuronal firing rates. We previously developed a head-fixed variant of an auditory tFC paradigm (Kaifosh et al., 2013Kaifosh P. Lovett-Barron M. Turi G.F. Reardon T.R. Losonczy A. Septo-hippocampal GABAergic signaling across multiple modalities in awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) conducive to two-photon microscopy. Water-deprived mice were head-fixed and immobilized in a stationary chamber (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z.V. Hires S.A. Li N. O’Connor D.H. Komiyama T. Ophir E. Huber D. Bonardi C. Morandell K. Gutnisky D. et al.Procedures for behavioral experiments in head-fixed mice.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e88678Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to prevent locomotion from confounding learning strategy (MacDonald et al., 2013MacDonald C.J. Carrow S. Place R. Eichenbaum H. Distinct hippocampal time cell sequences represent odor memories in immobilized rats.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 14607-14616Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Mice were presented with a 20 s auditory cue (CS), followed by a 15 s temporal delay (“trace”), after which the animals received aversive air puffs to the snout (US). A water port was accessible throughout each trial, and we used animals’ lick suppression as a readout of learned fear (Kaifosh et al., 2013Kaifosh P. Lovett-Barron M. Turi G.F. Reardon T.R.

Lo M. et al.Projections from neocortex mediate top-down control of memory retrieval.Nature. 2015; 526: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We first verified that learning in auditory head-fixed tFC was dependent on activity in the dorsal hippocampus. Optogenetic inhibition of CA1 activity resulted in a significant reduction in lick suppression (Figure S1), indicating that, as in freely moving conditions (Raybuck and Lattal, 2014Raybuck J.D.

Neurosci. 2005; 119: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), head-fixed tFC is dependent on the dorsal hippocampus. In order to investigate the underlying network dynamics during tFC, we selectively expressed the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6f in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 1B) via injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing Cre-dependent GCaMP6f in CaMKIIα-Cre mice (Dragatsis and Zeitlin, 2000Dragatsis I. Zeitlin S. CaMKIIalpha-Cre transgene expression and recombination patterns in the mouse brain.Genesis. 2000; 26: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The head fixation apparatus was mounted beneath the two-photon microscope objective, and mice were again water-restricted and trained to lick for water rewards while immobilized in the chamber (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z.V. Hires S.A. Li N. O’Connor D.H. Komiyama T. Ophir E. Huber D. Bonardi C. Morandell K. Gutnisky D. et al.Procedures for behavioral experiments in head-fixed mice.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e88678Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Once mice licked reliably, we began neural recordings during a differential tFC paradigm (Figure 1A), in which on each trial mice were exposed to one of two auditory cues (CS+ and CS−; either constant 10 kHz or pulsed 2 kHz, randomized across mice). After collecting 10–15 “Pre-Learning” trials per CS cue with exposure to the cue alone, we conditioned mice by selectively pairing CS+ trials with the US. Mice quickly acquired the trace association in the first 6 trials of CS+/US pairings (“Learning” trials). We recorded subsequent trials with continued US reinforcement, to prevent extinction; behavioral responses maintained a steady asymptote during these 20–25 “Post-Learning” trials (Figures 1C and 1D). Mice readily discriminated between the two cues throughout Post-Learning, as they suppressed licking consistently on CS+ trials but not CS− trials, in which the air puff was never presented (Figures 1C and 1D). Mice consistently discriminated between cues on the first trial of each day in the Post-Learning period, prior to receiving US reinforcement on that day, indicating retention (24 h recall) of the memory (Figure 1E). Imaging data from each trial were motion corrected (Kaifosh et al., 2014Kaifosh P. Zaremba J.D. Danielson N.B. Losonczy A.

Suite2p: beyond 10,000 neurons with standard two-photon microscopy.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/061507Crossref Google Scholar), and region of interest (ROI) spatial masks and activity traces were extracted using the Suite2p software package (Pachitariu et al., 2017Pachitariu M. Stringer C. Dipoppa M. Schröder S. Rossi L.F. Dalgleish H. Carandini M. Harris K.D. Suite2p: beyond 10,000 neurons with standard two-photon microscopy.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/061507Crossref Google Scholar). All traces were deconvolved (Friedrich et al., 2017Friedrich J. Zhou P. Paninski L. Fast online deconvolution of calcium imaging data.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005423Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to estimate underlying spike event times. After registering ROIs across sessions, we identified 1,991 CA1 pyramidal neurons from six mice (158–500 neurons per mouse) that were each active on at least four trials, which were used for subsequent analyses (Figure 2A). Neural activity spanned all trial periods during the task, with a large population response to the US (Figure 2A). We also noted a transient increase in activity prior to CS onset (−10 s), which may reflect neural responses to a mixture of salient events at the beginning of each trial (e.g., lick port access, reward onset, shutter, and scanning mirror sounds). We first asked whether the hippocampus generated a consistent temporal code during each trial to connect the CS and US representations (Sellami et al., 2017Sellami A. Al Abed A.S. Brayda-Bruno L. Etchamendy N. Valério S. Oulé M. Pantaléon L. Lamothe V. Potier M. Bernard K. et al.Temporal binding function of dorsal CA1 is critical for declarative memory formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Entorhinal-hippocampal neuronal circuits bridge temporally discontiguous events.Learn. Mem. 2015; 22: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After ordering trial-averaged population activity by the latency of neurons’ peak firing rates, a sequence naturally appears to span the trial period (Figure 2A, left), but this activity is not necessarily consistent across trials (compare with Figure 2A, right). We used decoding to probe for evidence of sequential activity in the neural data that was consistent across trials, as the presence of sequential dynamics such as “time cells” (MacDonald et al., 2011MacDonald C.J.

Low dimensional dynamics for working memory and time encoding.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/504936Crossref Google Scholar). We used an ensemble of linear classifiers trained to discriminate the population activity between every pair of time points (Bakhurin et al., 2017Bakhurin K.I. Goudar V. Shobe J.L. Claar L.D.

As the ability to decode time is not an exclusive feature of neural sequences but a signature of any consistent dynamical trajectory whereby the neural states become sufficiently decorrelated in time (e.g., consider monotonically “ramping” cells [Cueva et al., 2019Cueva C.J. Marcos E. Saez S. Genovesio A. Jazayeri M. Romo R. Salzman C.D. Shadlen M.N. Fusi S. Low dimensional dynamics for working memory and time encoding.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/504936Crossref Google Scholar] or chaotic dynamics [Buonomano and Maass, 2009Buonomano D.V. Maass W. State-dependent computations: spatiotemporal processing in cortical networks.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar]), our analysis addresses the broader question of whether any temporal coding arises during the task, without a priori assumptions on its form. We assessed whether neural activity was linearly separable between each pair of time points in the tone and trace periods of the task (Figure 2C). Decoding accuracy was no better than chance for most pairwise classifiers, suggesting that either the pattern of neural activity remains relatively constant, or the dynamics are not consistent across trials. As an additional test of temporal coding, we can combine the output of the classifier ensemble to predict the time bin label of individual activity vectors (Bakhurin et al., 2017Bakhurin K.I. Goudar V. Shobe J.L. Claar L.D. Buonomano D.V. Masmanidis S.C. Differential encoding of time by prefrontal and striatal network dynamics.J.

Low dimensional dynamics for working memory and time encoding.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/504936Crossref Google Scholar). For each time bin in a test trial, the neural activity is given to all pairwise classifiers, whose binary decisions are combined to determine the predicted time bin label of the data. Despite combining the information learned by all classifiers, decoding accuracy did not exceed chance-level performance (Figure 2D). We did not find consistent evidence of temporal coding during either Pre- or Post-Learning trials (Figure 2E). We obtained similar results using a nonlinear decoder and using data binned at a coarser time resolution (Figure S2A). In other tasks, hippocampal time cells were previously identified in simultaneously recorded populations of just tens of neurons (Pastalkova et al., 2008Pastalkova E. Itskov V. Amarasingham A. Buzsáki G. Internally generated cell assembly sequences in the rat hippocampus.Science. 2008; 321: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, MacDonald et al., 2011MacDonald C.J.

Carrow S. Place R. Eichenbaum H. Distinct hippocampal time cell sequences represent odor memories in immobilized rats.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 14607-14616Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), an order of magnitude smaller than the recordings we analyzed here, suggesting that CA1 time cell sequences are not a prominent phenomenon during this trace fear memory paradigm. One caveat of the time decoding analysis is that it is sensitive mainly to temporal dynamics that have consistent onset timing and scaling; any variation in these parameters across trials could degrade our ability to detect sequences. We alternatively analyzed the order of each cell’s peak firing time across trials, but the order consistency was within chance levels for both CS cues, during Pre- and Post-Learning (Figures S2B–S2E). Here we also assessed whether any sequential dynamics might have rapidly and transiently emerged during the initial “Learning” trials but did not find evidence for reliable temporal patterns (Figures S2B–S2E). We finally tested the hypothesis that the neural population might transition between different patterns of activity during each trial in a way that was not time locked to specific sensory or behavioral events but via neural sequences occurring at different times in each trial. We fit hidden Markov models (HMMs) to the data to identify these network motifs (Mazzucato et al., 2019Mazzucato L. La Camera G. Fontanini A. Expectation-induced modulation of metastable activity underlies faster coding of sensory stimuli.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Maboudi et al., 2018Maboudi K. Ackermann E. de Jong L.W. Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D. Diba K. Kemere C. Uncovering temporal structure in hippocampal output patterns.eLife. 2018; 7: e34467Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but despite considering a range of model parameters, we could not find evidence for sequential activity during any task phase (Figures S3A–S3F). These results indicate that temporal coding is not a dominant network phenomenon during tFC, so sequential activity is unlikely to bridge the gap between CS and US presentations even during the initial Learning phase. Our time decoding analyses indicated that most periods in time during the task were not consistently separable, which suggests that the network state during each trial may be relatively static. We considered an alternative hypothesis consistent with static activity, in which CS information is maintained by persistent activation of a subgroup of neurons (Kamiński et al., 2017Kamiński J.

Under this scenario, the population dynamics would not evolve in time but discretely shift to a static state according to the trial’s CS cue, permitting the identity of the cue to be decoded throughout the duration of the trial. To test this, we trained a separate linear decoder at each time bin during the task to predict the identity of the CS cue (Figures 3A–3C). Our choice of linear classifiers also allowed us to measure the importance of each neuron to the decoder’s decisions, by examining the weights of each neuron along a vector orthogonal to the separating hyperplane (Figures 3A and 3B). Examining these results across time bins, we found that we were unable to decode the CS identity with high accuracy during Pre-Learning or Post-Learning trials at any point prior to the delivery of the US (Figure 3D), indicating that information about the CS identity does not appear to be maintained in the moment-to-moment activity of CA1 pyramidal cell populations. Relatedly, activity was not robustly tied to instantaneous licking behavior, which differed markedly between cues during Post-Learning trials (Figures 1C and 1D). CS decoding accuracy was generally high during US delivery in Post-Learning trials, consistent with the reliable population response to the air puff (Figure 2A). We note that similar analyses applied to appetitive trace conditioning paradigms in monkeys allowed CS identity to be decoded from activity in amygdala and prefrontal cortex (Saez et al., 2015Saez A.

However, it remains unclear whether altered metabolism, a key regulator of NSPC activity, disrupts human neurogenesis and potentially contributes to cognitive defects. We investigated links between lipid metabolism and cognitive function in mice and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) expressing mutant fatty acid synthase (FASN; R1819W), a metabolic regulator of rodent NSPC activity recently identified in humans with intellectual disability. Mice homozygous for the FASN R1812W variant have impaired adult hippocampal NSPC activity and cognitive defects because of lipid accumulation in NSPCs and subsequent lipogenic ER stress. Homozygous FASN R1819W hESC-derived NSPCs show reduced rates of proliferation in embryonic 2D cultures and 3D forebrain regionalized organoids, consistent with a developmental phenotype. These data from adult mouse models and in vitro models of human brain development suggest that altered lipid metabolism contributes to intellectual disability."

Due to their gargantuan size and complexity, little is known about the life cycles of these viruses. To answer outstanding questions regarding giant virus infection mechanisms, we set out to determine biomolecular conditions that promote giant virus genome release. We generated four infection intermediates in Samba virus (Mimivirus genus, lineage A) as visualized by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Each of these four intermediates reflects similar morphology to a stage that occurs in vivo. We show that these genome release stages are conserved in other mimiviruses. Finally, we identified proteins that are released from Samba and newly discovered Tupanvirus through differential mass spectrometry. Our work revealed the molecular forces that trigger infection are conserved among disparate giant viruses.

For example, most GVs are larger than 300 nm and many have genomes exceeding 1 MB, containing an estimated 1,000+ open reading frames (Colson et al., 2017Colson P. La Scola B. Raoult D.

Despite an unusually broad host range and pathogenicity, little information is available on how GVs access their hosts. Infection usually occurs via phagocytosis (Abrahão et al., 2014Abrahão J.S.

Ameobal pathogen mimivirus infects macrophages through phagocytosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000087Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Once phagocytosed, a unique capsid vertex opens, which promotes nucleocapsid release and fusion with the phagosomal membrane, ultimately releasing the genome into the host cytoplasm. A pseudo-organelle (viral factory) is then formed (Suzan-Monti et al., 2007Suzan-Monti M. La Scola B. Barrassi L. Espinosa L. Raoult D.

The endpoint of GV infections is host cell death and release of new GV progeny into the environment. GVs are ubiquitous (Aherfi et al., 2016bAherfi S. Colson P. La Scola B. Raoult D.

Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus stability in environmental and clinical substrates: implications for virus detection and isolation.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e87811Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To survive such extremes, GVs have developed incredible capsid stability. Some GV capsids can retain infectivity for 30,000 years in permafrost (Legendre et al., 2014Legendre M. Bartoli J. Shmakova L. Jeudy S. Labadie K. Adrait A. Lescot M. Poirot O. Bertaux L. Bruley C. et al.Thirty-thousand-year-old distant relative of giant icosahedral DNA viruses with a pandoravirus morphology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2015; 112: E5327-E5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although capsid stability is beneficial for a virus to persist in harsh environments, it also creates a thermodynamic barrier that must be overcome once a suitable host cell is encountered; all known viruses must do this to propagate. Strategies and structures used for genome translocation are generally conserved across viral families. Among the tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages (Caudovirales), tail complexes interact with host receptor proteins to trigger conformational changes in the virion, leading to genome release (Parent et al., 2018Parent K.N. Schrad J.R. Cingolani G. Breaking symmetry in viral icosahedral capsids as seen through the lenses of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.Viruses. 2018; 10: E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly, many classes of eukaryotic viruses have conserved genome release mechanisms. Most enveloped viruses, including HIV, influenza, Zika virus, and herpesvirus, utilize one of three structurally conserved membrane fusion protein varieties (Harrison, 2015Harrison S.C. Viral membrane fusion.Virology. 2015; 479-480: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Non-enveloped viruses, such as rhinovirus, poliovirus, and adenovirus, utilize conserved capsid structures to interact with host receptors to trigger genome uncoating (Suomalainen et al., 2013Suomalainen M. Luisoni S. Boucke K. Bianchi S. Engel D.A. Greber U.F. A direct and versatile assay measuring membrane penetration of adenovirus in single cells.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 12367-12379Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Morphologically, GV virions are either icosahedral, exemplified by Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (La Scola et al., 2003La Scola B. Audic S. Robert C. Jungang L. de Lamballerie X. Drancourt M. Birtles R. Claverie J.M. Raoult D. A giant virus in amoebae.Science. 2003; 299: 2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), or non-icosahedral, typified by Mollivirus and Pithovirus (Legendre et al., 2014Legendre M. Bartoli J. Shmakova L. Jeudy S. Labadie K. Adrait A. Lescot M. Poirot O. Bertaux L. Bruley C. et al.Thirty-thousand-year-old distant relative of giant icosahedral DNA viruses with a pandoravirus morphology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2015; 112: E5327-E5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Like their smaller cousins, GVs also share conserved capsid structures that are used during infection. In many GVs, the unique capsid vertex provides a gateway for the infection process, but they also provide a mechanism to prevent premature loss of their precious cargo. GVs have developed at least two distinct vertex structures to seal the unique vertex until the time is right for infection: “corks” and “starfish.” Non-icosahedral GVs tend to utilize one or more cork-like structures (located flush with the capsid surface) as a seal complex (Andreani et al., 2016Andreani J.

Microbiol. 2018; 8: 2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), contain an ostiole-like structure, distinct from the cork-like structure. Mimivirus-like icosahedral GVs utilize an external proteinaceous seal complex that resembles a five-pointed starfish (Klose et al., 2010Klose T. Kuznetsov Y.G. Xiao C. Sun S. McPherson A.

These complexes sit at the outermost capsid layer at a unique 5-fold vertex (called the stargate vertex) and prevent it from opening (Xiao et al., 2009Xiao C. Kuznetsov Y.G. Sun S. Hafenstein S.L.

The molecular forces and biochemical trigger(s), such as receptor proteins or phagosomal transitions, that facilitate stargate opening are unknown. Additionally, the fate of the starfish remains a mystery; is the complex removed from the capsid en masse or does the complex simply unzip? The general steps and gross morphological changes that accompany GV infection have been visualized via thin section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of infected cells (Abrahão et al., 2014Abrahão J.S.

Following phagocytosis, the stargate vertex begins to open 1–3 h post-infection (Silva et al., 2019Silva L.C.F. Rodrigues R.A.L. Oliveira G.P. Dornas F.P. La Scola B. Kroon E.G. Abrahão J.S.

This knowledge gap is largely due to two factors: the complexity of GV virions and the lack of a robust model system for detailed biochemical and/or biophysical studies. Here, we have created an in vitro model system for studying the choreography that governs GV genome release. We were able to trap infection intermediates, identify specific proteins released during the initial stage of stargate opening, and test the efficacy of this technique on other icosahedral GVs, including SMBV, a member of Mimivirus lineage A (Campos et al., 2014Campos R.K.

Additionally, our model reveals that members of Mimivirus lineage A unzip their starfish complexes to initiate infection. To probe the molecular forces that play a role in SMBV starfish complex stability, we exposed SMBV to treatments known to affect morphology in other viruses (Table S1). The effect of each treatment on particle stability was assessed via cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Treatments included the denaturants urea (≥9 M) and guanidinium hydrochloride (≥6 M), the detergent Triton X-100, organic solvents, such as chloroform and DMSO, as well as enzymes DNase I, bromelain, proteinase K, and lysozyme. None of these treatments resulted in disruption of the SMBV virion over the baseline of ∼5% spontaneously open untreated SMBV particles (Schrad et al., 2017Schrad J.R. Young E.J. Abrahão J.S.

Three treatments did lead to significantly increased disruption of the stargate vertex: low pH; high temperature; and high salt (see following sections).

https://openalex.org/W3023665549,"Background Compared with Western Europe, the decline in cardiovascular (CV) mortality has been delayed in former communist countries in Europe, including the Czech Republic. We have assessed longitudinal trends in major CV risk factors in the Czech Republic from 1985 to 2016/17, covering the transition from the totalitarian regime to democracy. Methods There were 7 independent cross-sectional surveys for major CV risk factors conducted in the Czech Republic in the same 6 country districts within the WHO MONICA Project (1985, 1988, 1992) and the Czech post-MONICA study (1997/98, 2000/01, 2007/08 and 2016/2017), including a total of 7,606 males and 8,050 females. The population samples were randomly selected (1%, aged 25–64 years). Results Over the period of 31/32 years, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of smoking in males (from 45.0% to 23.9%; p < 0.001) and no change in females. BMI increased only in males. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both genders, while the prevalence of hypertension declined only in females. Awareness of hypertension, the proportion of individuals treated by antihypertensive drugs and consequently hypertension control improved in both genders. A substantial decrease in total cholesterol was seen in both sexes (males: from 6.21 ± 1.29 to 5.30 ± 1.05 mmol/L; p < 0.001; females: from 6.18 ± 1.26 to 5.31 ± 1.00 mmol/L; p < 0.001). Conclusions The significant improvement in most CV risk factors between 1985 and 2016/17 substantially contributed to the remarkable decrease in CV mortality in the Czech Republic."
https://openalex.org/W3037458097,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant diseases in male worldwide, yet, the molecular mechanisms involved in PCa progression are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the roles of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) pathway in PCa progression. It was demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis that both BDNF and TrkB were overexpressed in PCa tissues and elevated TrkB expression was tightly related with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of PCa. In vitro studies showed that stimulation with rhBDNF or overexpression of TrkB in PCa cells promoted cell migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Overexpression of TrkB also resulted in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like transformation in cell morphology, whereas RNA interference-mediated TrkB depletion caused reversion of EMT. Further investigation demonstrated that protein kinase B (AKT) was responsible for BDNF/TrkB signaling-induced pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects, EMT, and anoikis resistance. Finally, in vivo studies confirmed that enhanced TrkB expression facilitated tumor growth, whereas downregulation of TrkB suppressed tumor growth. Our findings illustrate that BDNF/TrkB pathway is crucial for PCa progression, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced PCa."
https://openalex.org/W3021126375,"Candida auris, a decade old Candida species, has been identified globally as a significant nosocomial multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen responsible for causing invasive outbreaks. Biofilms and overexpression of efflux pumps such as Major Facilitator Superfamily and ATP Binding Cassette are known to cause multidrug resistance in Candida species, including C. auris. Therefore, targeting these factors may prove an effective approach to combat MDR in C. auris. In this study, 25 clinical isolates of C. auris from different hospitals of South Africa were used. All the isolates were found capable enough to form biofilms on 96-well flat bottom microtiter plate that was further confirmed by MTT reduction assay. In addition, these strains have active drug efflux mechanism which was supported by rhodamine-6-G extracellular efflux and intracellular accumulation assays. Antifungal susceptibility profile of all the isolates against commonly used drugs was determined following CLSI recommended guidelines. We further studied the role of farnesol, an endogenous quorum sensing molecule, in modulating development of biofilms and drug efflux in C. auris. The MIC for planktonic cells ranged from 62.5-125 mM, and for sessile cells was 125 mM (4h biofilm) and 500 mM (12h and 24h biofilm). Furthermore, farnesol (125 mM) also suppresses adherence and biofilm formation by C. auris. Farnesol inhibited biofilm formation, blocked efflux pumps and downregulated biofilm- and efflux pump- associated genes. Modulation of C. auris biofilm formation and efflux pump activity by farnesol represent a promising approach for controlling life threatening infections caused by this pathogen."

Mammalian neural networks are complex systems in which nanoscopic synaptic specializations precisely connect mesoscopic local circuit elements, enabling the bottom-up emergence of behavior (Gürcan, 2014Gürcan O. Effective connectivity at synaptic level in humans: a review and future prospects.Biol. Cybern. 2014; 108: 713-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Understanding the generation of such behavior therefore requires a detailed knowledge of synaptic architectures and phenotypes across multiple scales. Synaptic networks are also frequent targets of neurological injury, with pathological alterations in synaptic connectivity (synaptopathy) recognized as a central, shared mechanism of neurological disease (Henstridge et al., 2016Henstridge C.M.

The clearest example of this is the rising public health crisis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Holtzman et al., 2011Holtzman D.M. Morris J.C. Goate A.M.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is both the leading cause of death and disability for younger individuals (under the age of 45; Langlois et al., 2006Langlois J.A.S. Rutland-Brown W. Wald M.M.M. The Epidemiology and Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury: A Brief Overview.Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation Highlights From the 2nd Federal TBI Interagency Conference. 2006; 21: 375-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the best-established environmental risk factor for AD (Chauhan, 2014Chauhan N.B.

The subcellular foci of brain injury in TBI and their connections to AD, however, remain in question. As all connectional lesions likely impact function, understanding the effect of neurotrauma on synaptic networks could lead to novel approaches to reducing impairment after TBI and interrupting its link to AD. Addressing these challenges requires approaches to synaptic network imaging and analysis that are broadly accessible, robust, and quantitative and that extend the analysis of nanoscopic synaptic elements to mesoscale regions (millimeter-scale networks that typify connectivity across individuals; Bohland et al., 2009Bohland J.W. Wu C. Barbas H. Bokil H. Bota M. Breiter H.C. Cline H.T. Doyle J.C. Freed P.J.

Because of their size, dense packing, and the exceptionally complex subcellular environment in which they reside, structural analysis of synapses has been extremely challenging. Electron microscopic (EM) approaches, informed by ultrastructural hallmarks, have long been capable of identifying and quantifying synapses with high specificity. Advanced implementations involving lathe ultramicrotomes (Kasthuri et al., 2015Kasthuri N. Hayworth K.J. Berger D.R. Schalek R.L. Conchello J.A. Knowles-Barley S. Lee D. Vázquez-Reina A. Kaynig V.

Horstmann H. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct three-dimensional tissue nanostructure.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e329Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), or ion beam milling (Knott et al., 2008Knott G. Marchman H. Wall D. Lich B. Serial section scanning electron microscopy of adult brain tissue using focused ion beam milling.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) are capable of mapping synaptic connectivity across mesoscale circuits with exquisite precision. These approaches, however, suffer from severe limitations in speed, laboriousness, and availability: scan times for local circuits (e.g., a murine cortical column) can extend to months or years (Briggman and Bock, 2012Briggman K.L. Bock D.D. Volume electron microscopy for neuronal circuit reconstruction.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the resulting voluminous imaging data must be annotated, frequently by hand, to catalog structures of interest, and molecular phenotyping is largely limited to two-dimensional analysis with minimal multiplexing. Array tomography (AT), a powerful extension of ultrasectioning-based synaptic characterization (Micheva and Smith, 2007Micheva K.D. Smith S.J. Array tomography: a new tool for imaging the molecular architecture and ultrastructure of neural circuits.Neuron. 2007; 55: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), layers multiplexed immunofluorescent phenotyping onto EM. Unlike standard optical sectioning techniques that suffer from inadequate axial resolution to reliably separate neighboring synaptic elements, AT utilizes physical ultrathin sectioning (50–200 nm) to achieve axial super-resolution (S-R). AT has revealed numerous features of synapses (Collman et al., 2015Collman F. Buchanan J. Phend K.D. Micheva K.D. Weinberg R.J. Smith S.J. Mapping synapses by conjugate light-electron array tomography.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 5792-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, its reliance on laborious and technically challenging production, staining, imaging, and subsequent reassembly of ultrathin 2D tissue arrays remains a substantial impediment to widespread adoption (Eisenstein, 2015Eisenstein M. Super-resolve me: from micro to nano.Nature. 2015; 526: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Optical implementations of S-R microscopy provide, in theory, a natively 3D alternative. Existing approaches, however, are technically challenging in their own right, often require specialized fluorophores incompatible with transgenic approaches, and struggle with large or 3D volumes, slow scan speeds, and/or poor signal strength (Lambert and Waters, 2016Lambert T.J. Waters J.C. Navigating challenges in the application of superresolution microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 216: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy is diffraction limited but benefits from straightforward sample preparation and imaging, compatibility with conventional exogenous and endogenous fluorescent probes, and rapid acquisition of large 3D image volumes. A recently optimized innovation in S-R imaging, image scanning microscopy (ISM; Gregor and Enderlein, 2019Gregor I. Enderlein J. Image scanning microscopy.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2019; 51: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, Sheppard, 1988Sheppard C.J.R. Super-resolution in confocal imaging.Optik (Jena). 1988; 80: 53-54Google Scholar), combines sub-diffraction limit (i.e., S-R) imaging with the well-developed labeling, hardware, accessibility, sensitivity, artifact resistance, and speed of confocal microscopy (Lambert and Waters, 2016Lambert T.J. Waters J.C. Navigating challenges in the application of superresolution microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 216: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the Airyscan implementation, this is accomplished via a 32-channel compound eye detector that reduces the effective confocal pinhole diameter while enhancing signal strength through parallelization of photon detection (Figure 1A). Combined with appropriate image analysis workflows, ISM potentially represents an ideal balance of resolution, efficiency, and accessibility for the rapid assessment of synaptic networks at scale. We set out to develop new histological and image analysis methodologies to rapidly detect and quantify synaptic loci in mammalian neuropil and to characterize their structural and molecular diversity in situ. The resulting “SEQUIN” technique (Synaptic Evaluation and QUantification by Imaging Nanostructure) is a combination of ISM imaging and localization-based analysis that identifies synaptic loci by virtue of intrasynaptic marker separations in line with ultrastructural parameters. We demonstrate the utility of SEQUIN by analyzing synapse loss in models of AD-related neurodegeneration and uncovering novel loci of circuit injury in diffuse TBI. ISM as implemented with the Airyscan microscope yields a 1.7-fold enhancement of lateral and axial resolution over confocal (Huff, 2015Huff J. The Airyscan detector from ZEISS: confocal imaging with improved signal-to-noise ratio and super-resolution.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 (i–ii)Crossref Google Scholar, Huff et al., 2017Huff J. Bergter A. Birkenbeil J. Kleppe I. Engelmann R. Krzic U. The New 2D Superresolution Mode for ZEISS Airyscan – 120 nm Lateral Resolution without Acquiring a Z-stack.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 1223Crossref Google Scholar), improving resolution to 140 × 140 × 350 nm (XYZ). S-R is achieved by reducing the effective pinhole diameter well below 1 Airy unit (AU) while avoiding concomitant loss of signal. The resulting light path lacks a pinhole aperture (Figures 1A and 1B); each element of the detector instead acts as an independent 0.2 AU pinhole, while post-imaging pixel reassignment ties sensitivity to the complete 1.25 AU detector array (Figure 1A). Neighboring synapses of mammalian cortex are separated by an average of 595 nm (Kasthuri et al., 2015Kasthuri N. Hayworth K.J. Berger D.R. Schalek R.L. Conchello J.A. Knowles-Barley S. Lee D.

Jones T.R. et al.Saturated Reconstruction of a Volume of Neocortex.Cell. 2015; 162: 648-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar; Figure 1C), below the axial resolution of diffraction-limited approaches. A 1.7-fold enhancement in resolution, however, resolves >97% of synaptic elements (Figure 1C). Thus, the improvements in optical sectioning afforded by ISM permit volumetric imaging of structures packed at synaptic density without resorting to physical ultrathin sectioning. The SEQUIN technique consists of (1) immunofluorescent labeling, (2) tissue clearing, (3) ISM of pre- and postsynaptic markers, (4) pre-processing of resulting 32-channel imaging data, (5) localization of pre- and postsynaptic centroids, and (6) identification of synaptic loci by virtue of ultrastructurally validated separation distances (Figure 1D). We initially targeted synapsin and PSD-95—proteins abundantly expressed at central synapses where they play distinct roles in sculpting synaptic function (Cesca et al., 2010Cesca F. Baldelli P. Valtorta F. Benfenati F. The synapsins: key actors of synapse function and plasticity.Prog.

Neurosci. 2008; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)—as pre- and postsynaptic markers, respectively. Imaging in thick sections revealed excellent antibody penetration (Figures S1A and S1B). Light scattering and refraction remain pervasive challenges in volumetric imaging, particularly with sensitive S-R applications (Ke et al., 2016Ke M.-T. Nakai Y. Fujimoto S. Takayama R. Yoshida S.

Lichtman J.W. Clarifying Tissue Clearing.Cell. 2015; 162: 246-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). SEQUIN was initially tested without tissue clearing, but substantial degradation in image quality within a few microns of the tissue surface was observed (Figure S1C). Clearing via refractive index matching in a water-soluble polyvinyl hydrocolloid (Mowiol 4-88) dramatically improved sensitivity and resolution, permitting excellent preservation of image quality throughout the labeled depth (Figures S1C and S1D). Following immunolabeling and tissue clearing, we ISM imaged pre- and postsynaptic markers using high numerical aperture objectives. SEQUIN data were acquired rapidly (<0.01 s/μm3). Image preprocessing entailed pixel reassignment and Weiner filter deconvolution (“Airyscan processing”; Figure 1D, step 4), followed by correction of chromatic aberration (see STAR Methods). ISM and pre-processing of a small region of mouse cortex yielded a clear improvement in sensitivity and resolution over confocal imaging (Figures 2A and 2B ). As expected, densely packed and less intense puncta were more readily distinguished using ISM, particularly those with close axial neighbors (Figures 2A–2C). Identifying synaptic loci by virtue of pre-to-postsynaptic marker separation requires localization of individual puncta to within tens of nanometers (Dani et al., 2010Dani A. Huang B. Bergan J. Dulac C. Zhuang X. Superresolution imaging of chemical synapses in the brain.Neuron. 2010; 68: 843-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Localization microscopy approaches permit localization of spectrally distinct fluorophores relative to one another at distances well below the resolution limit of the microscope (Bierbaum et al., 2017Bierbaum M. Leahy B.D. Alemi A.A. Cohen I. Sethna J.P. Light Microscopy at Maximal Precision.Phys. Rev. X. 2017; 7: 041007Google Scholar, Crocker and Grier, 1996Crocker J.C. Grier D.G. Methods of Digital Video Microscopy for Colloidal Studies.J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1996; 179: 298-310Crossref Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). To evaluate localization performance in the expected range of separation, DNA origami nanorulers with fluorophores separated by 70 and 140 nm were imaged (Figures 2D–2F). While fluorophores were not differentiable by confocal (Figure 2E), the measured inter-fluorophore distance using ISM agreed closely with their known physical separation (Figures 2F and 2G), confirming the accuracy of SEQUIN localization measurements at distances relevant to synaptic nanostructure. We next replicated this analysis over all imaged pre- and postsynaptic puncta throughout a small cortical volume (Figures 2H–2J; see Figure 1D, step 5). To accomplish this, we located the centroids of each pre- and postsynaptic punctum within the 3D volume (Figures 3A–3C). Spatial statistical analysis (Dixon, 2002Dixon P.M. Ripley’s K function.in: El-Shaarawi A.H. Piegorsch W.W. Encyclopedia of Environmetrics. John Wiley & Sons, 2002: 1796-1803Google Scholar) of the resulting intensity-filtered point patterns revealed that pre- and postsynaptic puncta were distributed randomly (Figures 3D and 3E). When the distribution of presynaptic puncta was considered relative to postsynaptic puncta, however, a clear tendency to co-associate emerged (Figure 3F). We therefore identified the nearest potential trans-synaptic partner (i.e., the nearest neighbor of the opposite type) for each punctum in the volume and calculated their Euclidean separation. Examination of these relationships revealed a bimodal distribution of separations (Figure 3G), with an early concentration at approximately 150 nm marker separation, and a broad secondary concentration of more distant associations. Suspecting that the early peak represented paired puncta at synaptic loci while the second consisted of random associations, we repeated the analysis after reflecting the PSD-95 image about its y axis. This maneuver maintained puncta density and overall distribution while eliminating putative intrasynaptic relationships. As expected, the resulting distribution lacked the early peak but retained the broad late peak of distant associations (Figure 3G), indicating that these distant associations are non-synaptic. The early peak, in contrast, represents non-random, nanoscopic associations of pre- and postsynaptic markers consistent with synaptic loci. Closer examination of the bivariate K function (Figure 3F) confirmed this interpretation: non-random associations appeared at short separation distances (<200 nm), but only random associations appeared at longer separations (the synapsin/PSD-95 K(r) did not further depart from random). Prior S-R analyses (Dani et al., 2010Dani A. Huang B. Bergan J. Dulac C. Zhuang X. Superresolution imaging of chemical synapses in the brain.Neuron. 2010; 68: 843-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, Gerth et al., 2017Gerth F. Jäpel M.

USA. 2017; 114: 12057-12062Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) indicate that pre- and postsynaptic markers associate at distances consistent with the early peak in the SEQUIN analysis. To further examine the nature of these pairings, we measured separations between postsynaptic densities and synaptic vesicle reserve pools (ultrastructural features expected to correspond to PSD-95 and synapsin centroids) using EM (Figure 3H; Thiel, 1993Thiel G. Synapsin I, synapsin II, and synaptophysin: marker proteins of synaptic vesicles.Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 87-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of inter-marker separations in this dataset (n = 339 synapses, median 196 nm) closely overlapped with the early peak in the SEQUIN analysis (Figure 3I), further indicating that this peak represents synaptic loci. Importantly, the appearance of a bimodal distribution of pre-to-postsynaptic separations was not a result of spectral crosstalk, antibody-related, or image processing artifacts and was replicated in an independent laboratory at a separate institution (Figure S2). As expected based on correlated light-EM reports using synaptic marker antibodies (Collman et al., 2015Collman F. Buchanan J. Phend K.D. Micheva K.D. Weinberg R.J. Smith S.J. Mapping synapses by conjugate light-electron array tomography.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 5792-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the number of non-synaptic puncta (Figure 3I, second peak) was larger than the number at synaptic loci (Figure 3I, first peak), further highlighting the importance of localization analysis to reliably identify synaptic loci. Several additional features of closely associated pairs were consistent with synaptic loci. The intrasynaptic pre-to-postsynaptic directional orientation vector lacked bias (Figure 3J; relative anisotropy = 0.006), in line with anatomic expectations and despite a non-isotropic resolution. Moreover, the intersynaptic orientation of synaptic loci exhibited radial anisotropy, consistent with the orientation of pyramidal dendritic arbors perpendicular to the cortical surface (Figure 3K). Detection of synaptic loci using SEQUIN is robust to overall image intensity (Figure S3), in contrast to methods dependent on image thresholding or densitometry. Thus, SEQUIN is well suited for comparisons of tissues with varying labeling efficiency, background levels, and/or opacity. Multiple antibodies were tested to achieve the greatest labeling efficiency, yielding a cocktail of pre- and postsynaptic antibodies that maximized detection. Inspection of the distribution of pre-to-postsynaptic separation distances as a function of puncta intensity revealed that most close pairings were formed by bright puncta (Figures 4A and 4B )—relatively dimmer puncta participated more often in pairings consistent with random associations. Histological variables that negatively impact signal strength (poor antibody penetration, inadequate RI matching, etc.) tended to increase the relative size of the late versus the early peak (data not shown). All puncta intensity groups, however, contributed puncta pairs consistent with synaptic loci (Figure 4B). Early and late peaks overlap substantially in intensity-inclusive datasets (Figure 4B). To quantify synaptic loci, we therefore isolated anatomical colocalizations (those dependent on subcellular microstructure) from those formed randomly (those dependent only on puncta density and distribution) by subtracting the purely random colocalizations identified after reflection of the PSD-95 image (Figure 4B and see Figure 3I). Quantification of resulting synaptic loci closely agreed with prior estimates from EM (0.85 versus 0.82 synapses/μm3 by EM; Anton-Sanchez et al., 2014Anton-Sanchez L. Bielza C. Merchán-Pérez A.

Disentangling the SEQUIN separation distribution through modeling as a mixture of two Gaussians generated a remarkably similar estimate (0.81 synapses/μm3; Figures 4C and S4). Reassuringly, there was minimal difference when using a post- (i.e., Figure 4) or presynaptic marker as the reference dataset for pairing (0.847 [PSD-95 reference] versus 0.854 [synapsin reference] synapses/μm3; Figure S4). Variability in the SEQUIN analysis was modest (coefficient of variation 12.1%–12.7%), resulting in practical sample size estimates (n = 6.9 for a 20% difference at 80% power, α 0.05 for single marker antibodies; n = 7.4 for the antibody cocktail; Figure 4D). Although the antibody cocktail maximized detection of synaptic loci, antibody species multiplexing limited flexibility for additional markers and required numerous additional controls (Figure S5). Subsequent experiments were therefore conducted with single primary antibody combinations. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by early synapse loss and fibrillar lesions, including amyloid plaques and tau tangles (Holtzman et al., 2011Holtzman D.M. Morris J.C. Goate A.M.

https://openalex.org/W3023696320,"Background Serious infections account for 25% of global newborn deaths annually, most in low-resource settings where hospital-based treatment is not accessible or feasible. In Bangladesh, one-third of neonatal deaths are attributable to serious infection; in 2014, the government adopted new policy for outpatient management of danger signs indicating possible serious bacterial infections (PSBI) when referral was not possible. We conducted implementation research to understand what it takes for a district health team to implement quality outpatient PSBI management per national guidelines. Methods PSBI management was introduced as part of the Comprehensive Newborn Care Package in 2015. The study piloted this package through government health systems with limited partner support to inform scale-up efforts. Data collection included facility register reviews for cases seen at primary level facilities; facility readiness and provider knowledge and skills assessments; household surveys capturing caregiver knowledge of newborn danger signs and care-seeking for newborn illness; and follow-up case tracking, capturing treatment adherence and outcomes. Analysis consisted of descriptive statistics. Results Over the 15-month implementation period, 1432 young infants received care, of which 649 (45%) were classified as PSBI. Estimated coverage of care-seeking increased from 22% to 42% during the implementation period. Although facility readiness and providers’ skills increased, providers’ adherence to guidelines was not optimal. Among locally managed PSBI cases, 75% completed the oral antibiotic course and 15% received the fourth day follow-up. Care-seeking remained high among private providers (95%), predominantly village health doctors (over 80%). Conclusions Facility readiness, including health care provider knowledge and skills were strengthened; future efforts should focus on improving provider adherence to guidelines. Social and behavior change strategies targeting families and communities should explore shifting care-seeking from private, possibly less-qualified providers. Strategies to improve private sector management of PSBI cases and improved linkages between private and public sector providers could be explored."
https://openalex.org/W3021521207,"Acute radiation exposure of the thorax can lead to late serious, and even life-threatening, pulmonary and cardiac damage. Sporadic in nature, late complications tend to be difficult to predict, which prompted this investigation into identifying non-invasive, tissue-specific biomarkers for the early detection of late radiation injury. Levels of circulating microRNA (miRNA) were measured in C3H and C57Bl/6 mice after whole thorax irradiation at doses yielding approximately 70% mortality in 120 or 180 days, respectively (LD70/120 or 180). Within the first two weeks after exposure, weight gain slowed compared to sham treated mice along with a temporary drop in white blood cell counts. 52% of C3H (33 of 64) and 72% of C57Bl/6 (46 of 64) irradiated mice died due to late radiation injury. Lung and heart damage, as assessed by computed tomography (CT) and histology at 150 (C3H mice) and 180 (C57Bl/6 mice) days, correlated well with the appearance of a local, miRNA signature in the lung and heart tissue of irradiated animals, consistent with inherent differences in the C3H and C57Bl/6 strains in their propensity for developing radiation-induced pneumonitis or fibrosis, respectively. Radiation-induced changes in the circulating miRNA profile were most prominent within the first 30 days after exposure and included miRNA known to regulate inflammation and fibrosis. Importantly, early changes in plasma miRNA expression predicted survival with reasonable accuracy (88–92%). The miRNA signature that predicted survival in C3H mice, including miR-34a-5p, -100-5p, and -150-5p, were associated with pro-inflammatory NF-κB-mediated signaling pathways, whereas the signature identified in C57Bl/6 mice (miR-34b-3p, -96-5p, and -802-5p) was associated with TGF-β/SMAD signaling. This study supports the hypothesis that plasma miRNA profiles could be used to identify individuals at high risk of organ-specific late radiation damage, with applications for radiation oncology clinical practice or in the context of a radiological incident."
https://openalex.org/W3020908737,"Despite the continual discovery of promising new cancer targets, drug discovery is often hampered by the poor druggability of these targets. As such, repurposing FDA-approved drugs based on cancer signatures is a useful alternative to cancer precision medicine. Here, we adopted an in silico approach based on large-scale gene expression signatures to identify drug candidates for lung cancer metastasis. Our clinicogenomic analysis identified GALNT14 as a putative driver of lung cancer metastasis, leading to poor survival. To overcome the poor druggability of GALNT14 in the control of metastasis, we utilized the Connectivity Map and identified bortezomib (BTZ) as a potent metastatic inhibitor, bypassing the direct inhibition of the enzymatic activity of GALNT14. The antimetastatic effect of BTZ was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, both BTZ treatment and GALNT14 knockdown attenuated TGFβ-mediated gene expression and suppressed TGFβ-dependent metastatic genes. These results demonstrate that our in silico approach is a viable strategy for the use of undruggable targets in cancer therapies and for revealing the underlying mechanisms of these targets."
https://openalex.org/W3023903052,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) function as modulators of microRNAs (miRNAs) and are often involved in cancer progression. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanism by which circRNA hsa-circ-000684 promotes the progression of gastric cancer (GC). Expression of hsa-circ-000684 and that of ZEB1 mRNA were elevated while microRNA-186 (miR-186) expression was downregulated in GC cell lines and clinical tissues. In addition, the effects of hsa-circ-000684 on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation of GC cells were examined through gain-and loss-of-function experiments. Furthermore, we introduced tumor xenografts into nude mice to better understand these effects in vivo. Either knockdown of hsa-circ-000684 or upregulation of miR-186 inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation in vitro, and reduced the xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, we found that hsa-circ-000684 and ZEB1 directly bound to miR-186. Hsa-circ-000684 increased the expression of ZEB1 by binding to miR-186. The tumor suppressive effects of hsa-circ-000684 knockdown were reversed by inhibition of miR-186. Collectively, our data show that hsa-circ-000684 reduces the miR-186 expression which leads to an increase in the ZEB1 expression and, consequently, promotion of GC progression."
https://openalex.org/W3021250802,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) require highly regulated rates of protein synthesis, but it is unclear if they or lineage-committed progenitors preferentially recruit transcripts to translating ribosomes. We utilized polysome profiling, RNA sequencing, and whole-proteomic approaches to examine the translatome in LSK (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+) and myeloid progenitor (MP; Lin−Sca-1−c-Kit+) cells. Our studies show that LSKs exhibit low global translation but high translational efficiencies (TEs) of mRNAs required for HSC maintenance. In contrast, MPs activate translation in an mTOR-independent manner due, at least in part, to proteasomal degradation of mTOR by the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. In the near absence of mTOR, CDK1 activates eIF4E-dependent translation in MPs through phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Aberrant activation of mTOR expression and signaling in c-Cbl-deficient MPs results in increased mature myeloid lineage output. Overall, our data demonstrate that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo translational reprogramming mediated by previously uncharacterized mechanisms of translational regulation."

https://openalex.org/W3020912656,"We present a novel modification of genetic algorithm (GA) which determines personalized parameters of cardiomyocyte electrophysiology model based on set of experimental human action potential (AP) recorded at different heart rates. In order to find the steady state solution, the optimized algorithm performs simultaneous search in the parametric and slow variables spaces. We demonstrate that several GA modifications are required for effective convergence. Firstly, we used Cauchy mutation along a random direction in the parametric space. Secondly, relatively large number of elite organisms (6–10% of the population passed on to new generation) was required for effective convergence. Test runs with synthetic AP as input data indicate that algorithm error is low for high amplitude ionic currents (1.6±1.6% for IKr, 3.2±3.5% for IK1, 3.9±3.5% for INa, 8.2±6.3% for ICaL). Experimental signal-to-noise ratio above 28 dB was required for high quality GA performance. GA was validated against optical mapping recordings of human ventricular AP and mRNA expression profile of donor hearts. In particular, GA output parameters were rescaled proportionally to mRNA levels ratio between patients. We have demonstrated that mRNA-based models predict the AP waveform dependence on heart rate with high precision. The latter also provides a novel technique of model personalization that makes it possible to map gene expression profile to cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W3021687736,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer and ranks amongst the leading causes of cancer mortality in young adults. Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1) is overexpressed in many cancers and has recently emerged as a novel target for cancer treatment. However, the role of JAB1 in osteosarcoma was virtually unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that JAB1-knockdown in malignant osteosarcoma cell lines significantly reduced their oncogenic properties, including proliferation, colony formation, and motility. We also performed RNA-sequencing analysis in JAB1-knockdown OS cells and identified 4110 genes that are significantly differentially expressed. This demonstrated for the first time that JAB1 regulates a large and specific transcriptome in cancer. We also found that JAB1 is overexpressed in human OS and correlates with a poor prognosis. Moreover, we generated a novel mouse model that overexpresses Jab1 specifically in osteoblasts upon a TP53 heterozygous sensitizing background. Interestingly, by 13 months of age, a significant proportion of these mice spontaneously developed conventional OS. Finally, we demonstrate that a novel, highly specific small molecule inhibitor of JAB1, CSN5i-3, reduces osteosarcoma cell viability, and has specific effects on the ubiquitin–proteasome system in OS. Thus, we show for the first time that the overexpression of JAB1 in vivo can result in accelerated spontaneous tumor formation in a p53-dependent manner. In summary, JAB1 might be a unique target for the treatment of osteosarcoma and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3023511866,"The study of oral disease progression, in relation to the accumulation of subgingival biofilm in gingivitis and periodontitis is limited, due to either the ability to monitor plaque in vitro. When compared, optical spectroscopic techniques offer advantages over traditional destructive or biofilm staining approaches, making it a suitable alternative for the analysis and continued development of three-dimensional structures. In this work, we have developed a confocal Raman spectroscopy analysis approach towards in vitro subgingival plaque models. The main objective of this study was to develop a method for differentiating multiple oral subgingival bacterial species in planktonic and biofilm conditions, using confocal Raman microscopy. Five common subgingival bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, Veillonella dispar, Actinomyces naeslundii and Prevotella nigrescens) were used and differentiated using a 2-way orthogonal Partial Least Square with Discriminant Analysis (O2PLS-DA) for the collected spectral data. In addition to planktonic growth, mono-species biofilms cultured using the ‘Zürich Model’ were also analyzed. The developed method was successfully used to predict planktonic and mono-species biofilm species in a cross validation setup. The results show differences in the presence and absence of chemical bands within the Raman spectra. The O2PLS-DA model was able to successfully predict 100% of all tested planktonic samples and 90% of all mono-species biofilm samples. Using this approach we have shown that Confocal Raman microscopy can analyse and predict the identity of planktonic and mono-species biofilm species, thus enabling its potential as a technique to map oral multi-species biofilm models."

Confounder analysis was done by age, sex, and type of diabetes. All-cause mortality and deaths in diabetic patients were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for each age group and a log-rank analysis was conducted.Average life expectancy in the non-diabetic population, patients with Type 1 DM and with Type 2 DM is 74.8; 70.96 and 75.19 years, respectively. For 2012-2015 the mortality in the non-diabetic population remained constant and lower (average-1.48%) compared to type-1 DM (5.25%) and Type-2 (4.27%). Relative risk of death in diabetics was higher overall (12%), after the age of 70 before which the relative risk was higher for the non-diabetic population. This was observed as a trend in all analyzed years.Patients with type 2 DM have a longer life-expectancy than patients with type-1 DM and overall Diabetics life expectancy equals that of the non-diabetic population, which could suggest improved disease control and its associated complications in Bulgaria. Male diabetics show slightly longer life expectancy than their counterparts in the non-diabetic population, by a marginal gain of 0.6 years for the entire observed period. Life expectancy in diabetic women increased by 1.3 years, which was not observed in the non-diabetic population. Prevalence of diabetes was higher for women. Improved diabetes control may explain this gain in life; however other studies are needed to confirm this."

Linear actuation of the CFS-PPy/DBS material exhibited 20% of strain variation with a stress of 0.14 MPa, rather similar to skeletal muscles. After 1000 cycles, the creeping effect was as low as 0,2% having a good long-term stability showing a strain variation per cycle of -1.8% (after 1000 cycles).

Despite its association with different health-related aspects, athletes may experience adverse outcomes, including injuries. The aim of this study was twofold: to examine the relationship between runners' resilience levels, motivation and incidence of injury, on the one hand; and to analyse the mediation that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation has on the association between the number of injuries and psychological resilience levels among amateur athletes. The sample consisted of a total of 1725 runners (age: 40.40 ± 9.39 years), 1261 of whom were male (age: 43.16 ± 9.38), and 465 of whom were female (age: 40.34 ± 9.14). Athletes completed the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3), the Resilience scale (CD-RISC 10), and an Injury retrospective survey. Three mediation models were constructed, and the results showed a significant indirect association of athletes' intrinsic motivation and resilience on the number of injuries (β = 0.022, CI = 0.007, 0.0) in mediation model 1, whereas extrinsic motivation was found to have no significant association on those variables (β = -0.062, CI = -0.137, 0.009) in mediation model 2. Model 3 showed significant differences with respect to resilience (p < 0.05) and intrinsic motivation (p < 0.05). Therefore, the mediation of intrinsic motivation on athletes' resilience levels and incidence of injury was demonstrated, i.e., it was found that intrinsic motivation was associated with a higher incidence of injury, while no such correlation was found for extrinsic motivation. This study shows that the amateur long distance runners with a high level of intrinsic motivation tend to suffer from a greater number of injuries, and at the same time psychological resilience was associated with a lower number of injuries."

Splenic contraction might be partially due to sympathetic hyperactivity and might be accompanied by release of splenocytes in the peripheral circulation, leading to immunodepression. Aims To investigate whether spleen volume changes in the first week after stroke are associated with post-stroke infections, changes in lymphocytes count and autonomic dysfunction. Methods In patients with acute ischemic stroke, spleen sizes were calculated from abdominal CT images on day one and day seven. Spleen size reduction was defined as > 10% spleen size reduction between day one and day seven. Post stroke infections were diagnosed during the first seven days after stroke onset using the modified criteria of the US Center of Disease Control and Prevention. We assessed the time course of leukocyte subsets and analysed pulse rate variability (PRV) indices. Results Post-stroke infections occurred in six out of 11 patients (55%) with spleen size reduction versus in five out of 27 patients (19%) without spleen size reduction (p = 0,047). Spleen size reduction was associated with a drop in lymphocytes and several lymphocyte subsets from admission to day one, and a higher NIHSS at admission and at day three (p = 0,028 and p = 0,006 respectively). No correlations could be found between spleen volume change and PRV parameters. Conclusion Post-stroke infections and a drop in lymphocytes and several lymphocyte subsets are associated with spleen volume reduction in acute ischemic stroke."

PMA2020 data showed that Kinshasa has a modern contraceptive prevalence of 26.5% among married women in 2018. In Kinshasa's method mix, the contraceptive implant recently became the dominant method among contraceptive users married and in union. This study provides insight into patterns of implant use in a high-fertility setting by evaluating the 24-month continuation rate for Implanon NXT and identifying the characteristics associated with discontinuation.This community-based, prospective cohort study followed 531 Implanon users aged 18-49 years at 6, 12 and 24 months. The following information was collected: socio-demographic characteristics, Method Information Index (MII) and contraceptive history. The main outcome variable for this study was implant discontinuation. The incidence rate of discontinuation is presented as events per 1000 person/months (p-m), from the date of enrolment. The Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to measure predictors of discontinuation.A total of 9158.13 p-m were available for analysis, with an overall incidence rate of 9.06 (95% CI: 9.04-9.08) removals per 1000 p-m. Of nine possible co-variates tested, the likelihood of discontinuation was higher among women who lived in military camps, had less than three children, never used injectables or implants in the past, had experienced heavy/prolonged bleeding, and whose MII score was less than 3.In addition to four client characteristics that predicted discontinuation, we identified one programmatic factor: quality of counseling as measured by the Method Information Index. Community providers in similar contexts should pay more attention to clients having less than three children, new adopters, and to clients living military camps as underserved population, where clients have less access to health facilities. More targeted counselling and follow-up is needed, especially on bleeding patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3021627674,"Antiretroviral therapy has a remarkable clinical effect in reducing the progress of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The clinical outcome of Anti-Retroviral therapy depends on strict adherence. Poor adherence reduces the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and increases viral replication. With changes in service delivery over time and differences in socio-demographic status from region to region, it is essential to measure adherence. Therefore, this study aimed to assess adherence to antiretroviral therapy and its associated factors among HIV/AIDS patients accessing treatment at Nekemte referral hospital, West Ethiopia.Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on 311 HIV/AIDS patients from March 01 to March 30, 2019. The study participants were selected by a simple random sampling method and interviewed using structured questionnaires. Bivariable logistic regression was conducted to find an association between each independent variable and adherence to antiretroviral medication. Multivariable logistic regression was used to find the independent variables which best predict adherence. The statistical significance was measured using odds ratio at a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of less than 0.05.Out of a total of 311 patients sampled, 305 were participated in the study, making a response rate of 98.07%. From these 305 study participants,73.1% (95% CI = 68.2, 78.0) were adherent to their medication. Having knowledge about HIV and its treatment (AOR = 8.24, 95% CI: 3.10, 21.92), having strong family/social support (AOR = 6.21, 95% CI: 1.39, 27.62), absence of adverse drug reaction (AOR = 5.33, 95% CI: 1.95, 14.57), absence of comorbidity of other chronic diseases (AOR = 5.72, 95% CI: 1.91, 17.16) and disclosing HIV status to the family (AOR = 5.08, 95% CI: 2.09, 12.34) were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of adherence to antiretroviral medication.The level of adherence to antiretroviral therapy was found low compared to WHO recommendation. The clinician should emphasize reducing adverse drug reaction, detecting and treating co-morbidities early, improving knowledge through health education, and encouraging the patients to disclose their HIV status to their families."

In this study, 88 of 150 diarrheic animals tested positive for E. coli. Of these, 54 samples had mixed infection with other bacterial and/or parasitic agents. There are several diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes including enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and necrotoxigenic E. coli (NTEC). Molecular detection of virulence factors Stx2, Cdt3, Eae, CNF2, F5, Hly, Stx1, and ST revealed their presence at 39.7, 27.2, 19.3, 15.9, 13.6, 9.0, 3.4, and 3.4 percent, respectively. As many as 13.6% of the isolates lacked virulence genes and none of the isolate had LT or CNF1 toxin gene. The odds of isolating ETEC from male calves was 3.6 times (95% CI: 1.1, 12.4; P value = 0.042) that of female calves, whereas the odds of isolating NTEC from male calves was 72.9% lower (95% CI: 91.3% lower, 15.7% lower; P value = 0.024) than that in females. The odds of isolating STEC in winter was 3.3 times (95% CI: 1.1, 10.3; P value = 0.037) that of spring. Antibiograms showed 48 (54.5%) of the isolates to be multi-drug resistant. The percent resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 79.5, 67.0, 54.5, and 43.0, respectively. Ceftazidime (14.8%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (13.6%) and aztreonam (11.3%) showed the lowest resistance, and none of the isolates was resistant to imipenem. The results of this study can help improve our understanding of the epidemiological aspects of E. coli infection and to devise strategies for protection against it. The prevalence of E. coli pathotypes can help potential buyers of calves to avoid infected premises. The antibiograms in this study emphasizes the risks associated with the random use of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3022131389,"Postural dysfunction is one of the most common community health symptoms and frequent chief complaints in hospitals. Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, muscle quality, and muscle strength, and is the main contributor to musculoskeletal impairment in the elderly. Previous studies reported that loss of muscle mass is associated with a loss of diverse functional abilities. Meanwhile, there have been limited studies concerning postural dysfunction among older adults with sarcopenia. Although sarcopenia is primarily a disease of the elderly, its development may be associated with conditions that are not exclusively seen in older persons. Also, recent studies recognize that sarcopenia may begin to develop earlier in life. The objective of this paper was to investigate the association between the prevalence of sarcopenia and postural dysfunction in a wide age range of adults using data from a nationally representative cohort study in Korea. Korean National Health & Nutrition Exhibition Survey V (KNHANES V, 2010–2012) data from the fifth cross-sectional survey of the South Korean population performed by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare were used. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM)/height (ht)2 was used to define sarcopenia, and the Modified Romberg test using a foam pad (“foam balance test”) was performed to evaluate postural dysfunction. ASM/ht2 was lower in women and significantly decreased with age in men. Subjects with sarcopenia were significantly more likely to fail the foam balance test, regardless of sex and age. Regression analysis showed a significant relationship between sarcopenia and postural dysfunction (OR: 2.544, 95% CI: 1.683–3.846, p<0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that sarcopenia (OR: 1.747, 95% CI: 1.120–2.720, p = 0.014) and age (OR: 1.131, 95% CI: 1.105–1.158, p<0.001) are independent risk factors for postural instability. In middle age subjects, the adjusted OR for sarcopenia was 3.344 (95% CI: 1.350–8.285) (p = 0.009). The prevalence of postural dysfunction is higher in sarcopenia patients, independent of sex and age."
https://openalex.org/W3022552615,"Sweet corn juice is becoming increasingly popular in China. In order to provide valuable health-related information to consumers, the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of raw and boiled purple sweet corn juices were herein investigated. Sugars, antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity were analyzed by conventional chemical methods. The viscosity and stability of juices were determined by Ubbelohde viscosity meter and centrifugation, respectively. Boiling process could elevate viscosity, stability and sugar content, and reduce antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity in corn juice. In addition, short time boiling efficiently reduced the degradation of anthocyanins during subsequent refrigeration. The content of amino acids, vitamin B1/B2 and E were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry was used for the analysis of fatty acids and aroma compounds. Several aroma compounds not previously reported in corn were identified, including 1-heptanol, 2-methyl-2-butenal, (Z)-3-nonen-1-ol, 3-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-hexadiene, and 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol. Interestingly, the boiling process had no apparent effect on the amino acids profile, but it caused a 45.8% loss of fatty acids in the juice by promoting the retention of fatty acids in the corn residue. These results provide detailed information that could be used for increasing consumers’ knowledge of sweet corn juice, further development of sweet corn juice by food producers, and maize breeding programs."

Recent 3-dimensional culture and human-mouse chimeric brain modeling systems developed using human pluripotent stem cells help us understand the complex properties of human microglia. As the brain-resident macrophages, microglia play critical roles in maintenance of brain homeostasis and regulation of diverse neuronal responses. Three years ago, Gosselin et al. reported that microglia are highly sensitive to the environment (Gosselin et al., 2017Gosselin D. Skola D. Coufal N.G. Holtman I.R. Schlachetzki J.C.M. Sajti E.

Within hours after microglia are isolated from the brain environment and transferred to culture conditions, they undergo significant changes in gene expression. Moreover, mounting evidence indicates that rodent microglia are not able to fully mirror the properties of human microglia in normal and disease conditions. Transcriptomic profiling of human and murine microglia reveals species-specific expression patterns in hundreds of genes, including genes involved in brain development, immune function, and phagocytic function (Galatro et al., 2017Galatro T.F.

Importantly, a large number of susceptibility genes to neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS), show differential expression patterns in human versus rodent microglia. These findings argue for the development of species-specific research tools to investigate the biology of human microglia in healthy and diseased states. To this end, scientists have started to exploit in vivo mouse chimera and in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) culture approaches with a goal of developing experimental models that would faithfully recapitulate the human-specific features of microglial biology. Human microglial chimeric mouse models have been independently developed by several research groups (Hasselmann et al., 2019Hasselmann J. Coburn M.A. England W. Figueroa Velez D.X.

Human iPSC-derived mature microglia retain their identity and functionally integrate in the chimeric mouse brain.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Notably, these studies have revealed strong similarities in the biology of xenotransplanted human microglia across different protocols, thus suggesting that the creation of such microglial chimeric models is highly robust and reproducible. Typically, for in vivo chimeras, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived primitive macrophage progenitors (PMPs), differentiated through yolk-sac-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells, are used for transplantation. These PMPs are implanted into immunodeficient Rag2−/− or NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice that also carry a human colony-stimulating factor 1 gene knock-in, which promotes survival of implanted human cells of myeloid lineage (Hasselmann et al., 2019Hasselmann J. Coburn M.A. England W. Figueroa Velez D.X. Kiani Shabestari S. Tu C.H. McQuade A. Kolahdouzan M. Echeverria K. Claes C. et al.Development of a Chimeric Model to Study and Manipulate Human Microglia In Vivo.Neuron. 2019; 103: 1016-1033 e1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PMPs are implanted into the brain of the early neonatal mouse, as it likely provides an environment that is more conducive than that of the adult mouse in terms of cell migration and engraftment. Indeed, the approach of using neonatal mice at postnatal day 0 or 1 yields extensive dispersal of donor-derived human cells in adult mouse brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb, generating a high degree of chimerism. As PMPs are at first highly proliferative, donor-derived cells expand in number after transplantation. In adult, the degree of microglial chimerization is as high as 80% of the brain microglia, and in the forebrain, around 8% of all brain cells are human microglial cells. After transplantation, PMPs differentiate in vivo and mature to acquire a phenotype typical of ramified, homeostatic microglia. In parallel with morphological maturation, the cells also acquire a characteristic microglial molecular identity by expressing key microglial genes at physiologically relevant levels (e.g., TMEM119, P2RY12, and SALL1) and do not overexpress genes related to activated microglia states. Interestingly, the donor-derived microglia form a demarcated border with host murine microglia (Xu et al., 2020Xu R. Li X. Boreland A.J. Posyton A. Kwan K. Hart R.P. Jiang P. Human iPSC-derived mature microglia retain their identity and functionally integrate in the chimeric mouse brain.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This is in line with the microglial characteristics that they territorially tile the entire brain, with individual cells occupying non-overlapping domains. This also suggests that the repulsive interaction among microglia may be highly conserved and occur between microglia from different species. Importantly, donor-derived microglia exhibit characteristics of human microglia in the mouse brain. Maturation of donor-derived human microglia appears to be accelerated in the much faster-developing mouse brain, relative to human brain. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that at 2 to 6 months post-transplantation, donor-derived human microglia closely resemble human microglia at infant to adult ages. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of the chimeric mouse brains demonstrate that xenografted human microglia within the chimeras recapitulate the differential expression of disease risk genes specific to human microglia. Xenografted microglia also develop phenotypes that resemble the heterogeneity observed in humans, and xenografted microglia display more ramified morphology in the gray matter, as opposed to the elongated morphology of xenografted microglia residing in white matter. Other myeloid-lineage phenotypes emerge from engrafted cells, including meningeal macrophages, choroid plexus macrophages, and perivascular macrophages. Thus, following development in an in vivo environment, xenografted microglia in the chimeric brain mimic a homeostatic population of human microglia. These xenografted microglia faithfully recapitulate the biological properties of human microglia and replicate molecular and phenotypical heterogeneity of the human microglia in a brain-region-dependent manner. Xenografted human microglia are dynamically and functionally integrated in chimeric mouse brain. Super-resolution imaging has shown synaptic proteins engulfed in xenografted human microglia in gray matter, suggesting that they perform a synaptic pruning function in the mouse brain. In both gray and white matter, xenografted human microglia have close contact with blood vessels (Xu et al., 2020Xu R. Li X. Boreland A.J. Posyton A. Kwan K. Hart R.P. Jiang P. Human iPSC-derived mature microglia retain their identity and functionally integrate in the chimeric mouse brain.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Xenografted microglia actively survey the parenchyma and sense their environment by extension and retraction of microglial processes as visualized by in vivo imaging (Hasselmann et al., 2019Hasselmann J. Coburn M.A. England W. Figueroa Velez D.X. Kiani Shabestari S. Tu C.H. McQuade A. Kolahdouzan M. Echeverria K.

In the current form of human microglial chimeric mouse models, there is a lack of peripheral adaptive immune system in the host, due to the use of immunodeficient mouse strains. Recent studies have shown that peripheral immune cells play an important role in the brain under homeostatic and disease conditions. To further improve the model, newborn immunodeficient mice could be dual reconstituted with a chimeric brain and a humanized immune system by receiving a co-transplant of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). A recent study (Li et al., 2017Li W. Gorantla S. Gendelman H.E. Poluektova L.Y. Systemic HIV-1 infection produces a unique glial footprint in humanized mouse brains.Dis. Model. Mech. 2017; 10: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) explored the feasibility of this by simultaneously engrafting brain-tissue-derived neural progenitors and liver-tissue-derived HSPCs collected from the same donor fetus into the brain and liver, respectively, of newborn irradiated NSG mice. Potentially, neural progenitors and PMPs, together with HSPCs differentiated from the same disease-specific human iPSCs, could be simultaneously transplanted into the same mice, which may lead to the generation of chimeric mouse brains with functional neural cells as well as brain innate immune system and peripheral adaptive immune system derived from the same human donor. In order to derive functional human microglia using in vitro approaches, groups have also incorporated hPSC-derived microglial progenitors into 3D organotypic neuroglial cultures (Muffat et al., 2016Muffat J. Li Y. Yuan B. Mitalipova M. Omer A. Corcoran S. Bakiasi G. Tsai L.H. Aubourg P. Ransohoff R.M. Jaenisch R. Efficient derivation of microglia-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 1358-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) or transplanted them into cerebral organoids that have already been assembled and cultured for a long period of time (Abud et al., 2017Abud E.M. Ramirez R.N. Martinez E.S. Healy L.M. Nguyen C.H.H. Newman S.A. Yeromin A.V. Scarfone V.M. Marsh S.E. Fimbres C. et al.iPSC-Derived Human Microglia-like Cells to Study Neurological Diseases.Neuron. 2017; 94: 278-293 e279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Recently, in order to promote mesoderm differentiation within cerebral organoids, Ormel et al. developed methods to generate organoids in the absence of dual SMAD inhibition, which is commonly used to induce neuroectoderm differentiation (Ormel et al., 2018Ormel P.R. Vieira de Sá R. van Bodegraven E.J. Karst H. Harschnitz O. Sneeboer M.A.M. Johansen L.E. van Dijk R.E. Scheefhals N. Berdenis van Berlekom A. et al.Microglia innately develop within cerebral organoids.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). With this method, microglia innately develop within cerebral organoids. Compared with 2-dimensional cultures, microglial maturation in cerebral organoids or 3D organotypic neuroglial cultures is improved, as indicated by their branching patterns and rapid extension and retraction of filopodial arbor termini. Importantly, these microglia are functional and able to phagocytize synaptic materials. The 3D culture models have proven to be valuable in many studies of human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, relative to chimeric mouse models, these 3D cultures consist of purely human cells and are easier to manipulate and create at a higher throughput. Both the in vitro 3D cultures and the in vivo chimeric mouse models have been used to model neurological indications. In the 3D cultures, microglia can survey their neuronal environment and respond to localized cellular damage, such as damage induced by two-photon laser ablation. The microglia also respond to inflammatory stimulation, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a component of bacterial membrane that triggers immune responses, and are capable of releasing inflammatory cytokines. In the chimeric mouse brains, xenografted microglia rapidly respond to laser-induced focal brain injury and phagocytize cell debris after repeated mild closed head injury. Upon treatment with LPS, xenografted microglia adopt a more activated state, displaying ameboid morphology coupled with downregulation of homeostatic marker P2RY12 and upregulation of genes related to phagocytosis and immune function. When transplanted into an immunodeficient AD murine model, xenografted human microglia surrounding Aβ plaques acquire amoeboid morphology, phagocytize Aβ plaques, downregulate homeostatic markers, and express disease-associated microglia markers such as APOE, CD9, and TREM2. As a proof-of-concept with human gene variants, the effects of an R47H mutation in the TREM2 gene, which was previously shown to reduce association of microglia with Aβ plaques in both mouse models of AD and human patients, was modeled in microglial chimeric mice. These R47H mutant xenografted microglia behave as predicted and display reduced microglial association with Aβ plaques (Hasselmann et al., 2019Hasselmann J. Coburn M.A. England W. Figueroa Velez D.X. Kiani Shabestari S. Tu C.H. McQuade A. Kolahdouzan M. Echeverria K.

In another model for MS, microglial chimeric mice have also been examined under cuprizone-induced demyelination conditions. Following cuprizone treatment, xenografted microglia residing in the corpus callosum are found to phagocytize myelin debris and upregulate MS markers CD74 and SPP1 (Xu et al., 2020Xu R. Li X. Boreland A.J. Posyton A. Kwan K. Hart R.P. Jiang P. Human iPSC-derived mature microglia retain their identity and functionally integrate in the chimeric mouse brain.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data demonstrate that microglia in both the 3D cultures and the chimeric brain faithfully recapitulate core functions of in vivo human microglia. Important avenues of enquiry into human microglial functions have emerged over the past 3 years. The combination of hPSC-based 3D culture and human-mouse microglial chimeric brain models will further our understanding of the biology of human microglia and their roles in the pathogenesis of disorders of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3021338373,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is predicted to affect around 17.9 million individuals in Europe by 2060. The disease is associated with severe electrical and structural remodelling of the heart, and increased the risk of stroke and heart failure. In order to improve treatment and find new drug targets, the field needs to better comprehend the exact molecular mechanisms in these remodelling processes. Objectives This study aims to identify gene and miRNA networks involved in the remodelling of AF hearts in AF patients with mitral valve regurgitation (MVR). Methods Total RNA was extracted from right atrial biopsies from patients undergoing surgery for mitral valve replacement or repair with AF and without history of AF to test for differentially expressed genes and miRNAs using RNA-sequencing and miRNA microarray. In silico predictions were used to construct a mRNA-miRNA network including differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs. Gene and chromosome enrichment analysis were used to identify molecular pathways and high-density AF loci. Results We found 644 genes and 43 miRNAs differentially expressed in AF patients compared to controls. From these lists, we identified 905 pairs of putative miRNA-mRNA interactions, including 37 miRNAs and 295 genes. Of particular note, AF-associated miR-130b-3p, miR-338-5p and miR-208a-3p were differentially expressed in our AF tissue samples. These miRNAs are predicted regulators of several differentially expressed genes associated with cardiac conduction and fibrosis. We identified two high-density AF loci in chromosomes 14q11.2 and 6p21.3. Conclusions AF in MVR patients is associated with down-regulation of ion channel genes and up-regulation of extracellular matrix genes. Other AF related genes are dysregulated and several are predicted to be targeted by miRNAs. Our novel miRNA-mRNA regulatory network provides new insights into the mechanisms of AF."

To implement the numerical investigations, dielectric properties of the samples were first measured by a dielectric probe kit then uploaded into the simulation program. Results showed a linear shifting in the resonant frequency of the sensor when the dielectric constant of the samples were changed due to different concentrations of ethanol alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. A good agreement was observed between the calculated and measured results, emphasizing the usability of dielectric behavior as an input sensing agent.

The association between attending exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (43% participation rate) and changes in cardiovascular risk profile between baseline and one-year follow-up was assessed using multivariable regression analysis adjusting for age, comorbidities and medication.Attenders more often reported to have stopped smoking (men 64% vs 50%; women 64% vs 53%, p<0.001 for both, only smokers at baseline considered), be more physically active (men 3.9±2.5 vs 3.4±2.7 days/week; women 3.8±2.6 vs 3.0±2.8 days/week, p<0.001 for both) and achieved a slightly larger reduction in triglycerides (men -0.2±0.8 vs -0.1±0.9 mmol/L, p = 0.001; women -0.1±0.6 vs 0.0±0.8 mmol/L, p = 0.01) at one-year compared to non-attenders. Male attenders gained less weight (+0.0±5.7 vs +0.3±5.7 kg, p = 0.01) while female attenders achieved better lipid control (total cholesterol -1.2±1.4 vs -0.9±1.4 mmol/L, p<0.001; low-density lipoprotein -1.2±1.2 vs -0.9 ±1.2 mmol/L, p<0.001) compared to non-attenders.In an unselected registry cohort of patients post myocardial infarction, compared to non-attenders those attending exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation achieved significantly larger improvements in cardiovascular risk factors at one-year after the acute event."
https://openalex.org/W3021183931,"The end timing of T waves in fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) is important for the evaluation of ST and QT intervals which are vital markers to assess cardiac repolarization patterns. Monitoring malignant fetal arrhythmias in utero is fundamental to care in congenital heart anomalies preventing perinatal death. Currently, reliable detection of end of T waves is possible only by using fetal scalp ECG (fsECG) and fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG). fMCG is expensive and less accessible and fsECG is an invasive technique available only during intrapartum period. Another safer and affordable alternative is the non-invasive fECG (nfECG) which can provide similar assessment provided by fsECG and fMECG but with less accuracy (not beat by beat). Detection of T waves using nfECG is challenging because of their low amplitudes and high noise. In this study, a novel model-based method that estimates the end of T waves in nfECG signals is proposed. The repolarization phase has been modeled as the discharging phase of a capacitor. To test the model, fECG signals were collected from 58 pregnant women (age: (34 ± 6) years old) bearing normal and abnormal fetuses with gestational age (GA) 20-41 weeks. QT and QTc intervals have been calculated to test the level of agreement between the model-based and reference values (fsECG and Doppler Ultrasound (DUS) signals) in normal subjects. The results of the test showed high agreement between model-based and reference values (difference < 5%), which implies that the proposed model could be an alternative method to detect the end of T waves in nfECG signals."
https://openalex.org/W3022789664,"Morphological variation between individuals can increase niche segregation and decrease intraspecific competition when heterogeneous individuals explore their environment in different ways. Among bat species, wing shape correlates with flight maneuverability and habitat use, with species that possess broader wings typically foraging in more cluttered habitats. However, few studies have investigated the role of morphological variation in bats for niche partitioning at the individual level. To determine the relationship between wing shape and diet, we studied a population of the insectivorous bat species Pteronotus mesoamericanus in the dry forest of Costa Rica. Individual diet was resolved using DNA metabarcoding, and bat wing shape was assessed using geometric morphometric analysis. Inter-individual variation in wing shape showed a significant relationship with both dietary dissimilarity based on Bray-Curtis estimates, and nestedness derived from an ecological network. Individual bats with broader and more rounded wings were found to feed on a greater diversity of arthropods (less nested) in comparison to individuals with triangular and pointed wings (more nested). We conclude that individual variation in bat wing morphology can impact foraging efficiency leading to the observed overall patterns of diet specialization and differentiation within the population."
https://openalex.org/W3023856722,"Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whopping cough, produces an adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) that plays a key role in the host colonization by targeting innate immune cells which express CD11b/CD18, the cellular receptor of CyaA. CyaA is also able to invade non-phagocytic cells, via a unique entry pathway consisting in a direct translocation of its catalytic domain across the cytoplasmic membrane of the cells. Within the cells, CyaA is activated by calmodulin to produce high levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and alter cellular physiology. In this study, we explored the effects of CyaA toxin on the cellular and molecular structure remodeling of A549 alveolar epithelial cells. Using classical imaging techniques, biochemical and functional tests, as well as advanced cell mechanics method, we quantify the structural and functional consequences of the massive increase of intracellular cyclic AMP induced by the toxin: cell shape rounding associated to adhesion weakening process, actin structure remodeling for the cortical and dense components, increase in cytoskeleton stiffness, and inhibition of migration and repair. We also show that, at low concentrations (0.5 nM), CyaA could significantly impair the migration and wound healing capacities of the intoxicated alveolar epithelial cells. As such concentrations might be reached locally during B. pertussis infection, our results suggest that the CyaA, beyond its major role in disabling innate immune cells, might also contribute to the local alteration of the epithelial barrier of the respiratory tract, a hallmark of pertussis."
https://openalex.org/W3022113135,"Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae have been marketed as an excellent choice for providing calcium to reptiles without the need of dusting or gut loading. However, previous studies have indicated that they have limited calcium digestibility and are deficient in fat soluble vitamins (A, D3, and E). In this feeding and digestibility trial, 24 adult male leopard geckos were fed one of three diets for 4 months: 1) whole, vitamin A gut loaded larvae; 2) needle pierced, vitamin A gut loaded larvae; or 3) whole, non-gut loaded larvae. Fecal output from the geckos was collected daily and apparent digestibility was calculated for dry matter, protein, fat, and minerals. There were no differences in digestibility coefficients among groups. Most nutrients were well digested by the leopard geckos when compared to previous studies, with the exception of calcium (digestibility co-efficient 43%), as the calcium-rich exoskeleton usually remained intact after passage through the GI tract. Biochemistry profiles revealed possible deficits occurring over time for calcium, sodium, and total protein. In regards to vitamin A digestibility, plasma and liver vitamin A concentrations were significantly higher in the supplemented groups (plasma- gut loaded groups: 33.38 ± 7.11 ng/ml, control group: 25.8 ± 6.72 ng/ml, t = 1.906, p = 0.04; liver- gut loaded groups: 28.67 ± 18.90 μg/g, control group: 14.13 ± 7.41 μg/g, t = 1.951, p = 0.03). While leopard geckos are able to digest most of the nutrients provided by BSF larvae, including those that have been gut loaded, more research needs to be performed to assess whether or not they provide adequate calcium in their non-supplemented form."
https://openalex.org/W3023213671,"Objectives Autopsy rates worldwide have dropped significantly over the last five decades. Imaging based autopsies are increasingly used as alternatives to conventional autopsy (CA). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the introduction of minimally invasive autopsy, consisting of CT, MRI and tissue biopsies on the overall autopsy rate (of CA and minimally invasive autopsy) and the autopsy rate among different ethnicities. Methods We performed a prospective single center before-after study. The intervention was the introduction of minimally invasive autopsy as an alternative to CA. Minimally invasive autopsy consisted of MRI, CT, and CT-guided tissue biopsies. Autopsy rates over time and the effect of introducing minimally invasive autopsy were analyzed with a linear regression model. We performed a subgroup analysis comparing the autopsy rates of two groups: a group of western-European ethnicity versus a group of other ethnicities. Results Autopsy rates declined from 14.0% in 2010 to 8.3% in 2019. The linear regression model showed a significant effect of both time and availability of minimally invasive autopsy on the overall autopsy rate. The predicted autopsy rate in the model started at 15.1% in 2010 and dropped approximately 0.1% per month (β = -0.001, p < 0.001). Availability of minimally invasive autopsy increased the overall autopsy rate by 2.4% (β = 0.024, p < 0.001). The overall autopsy rate of people with an ethnic background other than western-European was significantly higher in years when minimally invasive autopsy was available compared to when it was not (22/176 = 12.5% vs. 81/1014 (8.0%), p = 0.049). Conclusions The introduction of the minimally invasive autopsy had a small, but significant effect on the overall autopsy rate. Furthermore, the minimally invasive autopsy appears to be more acceptable than CA among people with an ethnicity other than western-European."
https://openalex.org/W3020858016,"Human skin, not previously frozen, was studied by small-angle X-ray diffraction. The samples were folded so that a 6μm X-ray beam passed through the top layer of skin, stratum corneum. Diffraction patterns recorded with this method consisted of peaks at about q = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.4 nm-1 in the direction perpendicular to the skin surface more clearly than in previous studies. These peaks are interpreted to arise from lipids between corneocytes. A simple unit of a linear electron density profile with three minima was used to account for the observed intensity profiles. Combinations of calculated diffraction from models with one, two and three units accounted for the major part of the observed diffraction pattern, showing the diversity in the structure of the intercellular lipids."
https://openalex.org/W3021359099,"Various nanopatterning techniques have been developed to improve cell proliferation and differentiation efficiency. As we previously reported, nanopillars and pores are able to sustain human pluripotent stem cells and differentiate pancreatic cells. From this, the nanoscale patterns would be effective environment for the co-culturing of epithelial and mesenchymal cell types. Interestingly, the nanopatterning selectively reduced the proliferative rate of mesenchymal cells while increasing the expression of adhesion protein in epithelial type cells. Additionally, co-cultured cells on the nanopatterning were not negatively affected in terms of cell function metabolic ability or cell survival. This is in contrast to conventional co-culturing methods such as ultraviolet or chemical treatments. The nanopatterning appears to be an effective environment for mesenchymal co-cultures with typically low proliferative rates cells such as astrocytes, neurons, melanocytes, and fibroblasts without using potentially damaging treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3021764049,"The present study examined emotional facial perception (happy and angry) in 7, 9 and 11-year-old children from Caucasian and multicultural environments with an offset task for two ethnic groups of faces (Asian and Caucasian). In this task, participants were required to respond to a dynamic facial expression video when they believed that the first emotion presented had disappeared. Moreover, using an eye-tracker, we evaluated the ocular behavior pattern used to process these different faces. The analyses of reaction times do not show an emotional other-race effect (i.e., a facility in discriminating own-race faces over to other-race ones) in Caucasian children for Caucasian vs. Asian faces through offset times, but an effect of emotional face appeared in the oldest children. Furthermore, an eye-tracked ocular emotion and race-effect relative to processing strategies is observed and evolves between age 7 and 11. This study strengthens the interest in advancing an eye-tracking study in developmental and emotional processing studies, showing that even a ""silent"" effect should be detected and shrewdly analyzed through an objective means."
https://openalex.org/W3023056572,"Fruits have been widely considered as the default “health foods” because they contain numerous vitamins and minerals needed to sustain human health. Fermentation strategies have been utilized to enhance the nutritive and flavor features of healthy and readily consumable fruit products while extending their shelf lives. A traditional fermented multi-fruit beverage was made from five fruits including kiwi, guava, papaya, pineapple, and grape fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae along with lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria. The immunomodulatory properties of the fermented multi-fruit beverage, in vivo nonspecific and ovalbumin (OVA)-specific immune response experiments using female BALB/c mice were performed. Administration of the fermented multi-fruit beverage reduced the calorie intake, thus resulting in a less weight gain in mice compared to the water (placebo)-fed mice. In the nonspecific immune study model, the fermented multi-fruit beverage enhanced phagocytosis and T cell proliferation but did not affect B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin G (IgG) production. Analysis of cytokine secretion profile also revealed that the fermented multi-fruit beverage enhanced proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and T helper (Th)1-related cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ production, thus creating an immunostimulatory effect. Nonetheless, in the specific immune study model, the results showed that the fermented multi-fruit beverage decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α production in OVA-immunized mice. Moreover, it also caused a decrease in the production of anti-OVA IgG1, which was accompanied by a decrease in Th2-related cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 production and an increase in Th1-related cytokine IFN-γ production, indicating that it may have the potential to shift the immune system from the allergen‐specific Th2 responses toward Th1-type responses. The results indicate that fermented multi-fruit beverage has the potential to modulate immune responses both in a nonspecific and specific manners."
https://openalex.org/W3021872279,"Background Percutaneous coronary intervention represents the most important treatment modality of coronary artery stenosis. In-stent restenosis (ISR) is still a limitation for the long-term outcome despite the introduction of drug eluting stents. It has been shown that adipokines directly influence vessel wall homeostasis by influencing the function of endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells. Visceral adipose tissue-derived serpin vaspin was recently identified as a member of serine protease inhibitor family and serveral studies could demonstrate a relation to metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate a role of vaspin in the development of in-stent restenosis in vivo and on migration of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in vitro. Methods We studied 85 patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent elective and successful PCI with implatation of drug eluting stents. Blood samples were taken directly before PCI. Vaspin plasma levels were measured by specific ELISA. ISR was evaluated eight months later by coronary angiography. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) migration was analyzed by an in-vitro migration assay with different concentrations (0.004ng/mL up to 40ng/mL) of vaspin as well as by an scratch assay. For proliferation an impedance measurement with specialiced E-Plates was performed. Results During the follow up period, 14 patients developed ISR. Patients with ISR had significantly lower vaspin plasma levels compared to patients without ISR (0.213 ng/ml vs 0.382 ng/ml; p = 0.001). In patients with plasma vaspin levels above 1.35 ng/ml we could not observe any restenosis. There was also a significant correlation of plasma vaspin levels and late lumen loss in the stented coronary segments. Further we could demonstrate that vaspin nearly abolishes serum induced migration of HCASMC (100% vs. 9%; p<0.001) in a biphasic manner but not migration of HUVEC. Proliferation of HCASMC and HUVEC was not modulated by vaspin treatment. Conclusion We were able to show that the adipokine vaspin selectively inhibits human coronary SMC migration in vitro and has no effect on HUVEC migration. Vaspin had no effect on proliferation of HUVEC which is an important process of the healing of the stented vessel. In addition, the occurrence of ISR after PCI with implantation of drug eluting stents was significantly associated with low vaspin plasma levels before intervention. Determination of vaspin plasma levels before PCI might be helpful in the identification of patients with high risk for development of ISR after stent implantation. In addition, the selective effects of vaspin on smooth muscle cell migration could potentially be used to reduce ISR without inhibition of re-endothelialization of the stented segment."
https://openalex.org/W3022398729,"Populations often show complex spatial and temporal dynamics, creating challenges in designing and implementing effective surveys. Inappropriate sampling designs can potentially lead to both under-sampling (reducing precision) and over-sampling (through the extensive and potentially expensive sampling of correlated metrics). These issues can be difficult to identify and avoid in sample surveys of fish populations as they tend to be costly and comprised of multiple levels of sampling. Population estimates are therefore affected by each level of sampling as well as the pathway taken to analyze such data. Though simulations are a useful tool for exploring the efficacy of specific sampling strategies and statistical methods, there are a limited number of tools that facilitate the simulation testing of a range of sampling and analytical pathways for multi-stage survey data. Here we introduce the R package SimSurvey, which has been designed to simplify the process of simulating surveys of age-structured and spatially-distributed populations. The package allows the user to simulate age-structured populations that vary in space and time and explore the efficacy of a range of built-in or user-defined sampling protocols to reproduce the population parameters of the known population. SimSurvey also includes a function for estimating the stratified mean and variance of the population from the simulated survey data. We demonstrate the use of this package using a case study and show that it can reveal unexpected sources of bias and be used to explore design-based solutions to such problems. In summary, SimSurvey can serve as a convenient, accessible and flexible platform for simulating a wide range of sampling strategies for fish stocks and other populations that show complex structuring. Various statistical approaches can then be applied to the results to test the efficacy of different analytical approaches."

https://openalex.org/W3023181793,"The oceanographic conditions of the Pacific Ocean are largely modified by El Niño (EN), affecting several ecological processes. Parasites and other marine organisms respond to environmental variation, but the influence of the EN cycle on the seasonal variation of parasitic copepods has not been yet evaluated. We analysed the relation between infection parameters (prevalence and mean intensity) of the widespread parasitic copepods Caligus bonito and Charopinopsis quaternia in the dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus and oceanography during the strong 2015–16 EN. Fish were collected from capture fisheries on the Ecuadorian coast (Tropical Eastern Pacific) over a 2-year period. Variations of sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, chlorophyll a (Chl-a), Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), total host length (TL) and monthly infection parameters of both copepod species were analysed using time series and cross-correlations. We used the generalised additive models for determine the relationship between environmental variables and infection parameters. The total body length of the ovigerous females and the length of the eggs of C. bonito were measured in both periods. Infection parameters of both C. bonito and Ch. quaternia showed seasonal and annual patterns associated with the variation of environmental variables examined (SST, salinity, Chl-a and ONI 1+2). Infection parameters of both copepod species were significantly correlated with ONI 1+2, SST, TL and Chl-a throughout the GAMLSS model, and the explained deviance contribution ranged from 16%-36%. Our results suggest than an anomaly higher than +0.5°C triggers a risen in infection parameters of both parasitic copepods. This risen could be related to increases in egg length, female numbers and the total length of the ovigerous females in EN period. This study provides the first evidence showing that tropical parasitic copepods are sensitive to the influence of EN event, especially from SST variations. The observed behaviour of parasitic copepods likely affects the host populations and structure of the marine ecosystem at different scales."
https://openalex.org/W3021223679,"Although scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can generate high-resolution images of nanosized objects, it requires a high vacuum to do so, which precludes direct observations of living organisms and often produces unwanted structural changes. It has previously been reported that a simple surface modification gives rise to a nanoscale layer, termed the ""NanoSuit"", which can keep small animals alive under the high vacuum required for field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). We have previously applied this technique to plants, and successfully observed healthy petals in a fully hydrated state using SEM. The flower petals protected with the NanoSuit appeared intact, although we still lack a fundamental understanding of the images of other plants observed using FE-SEM. This report presents and evaluates a rich set of images, acquired using the NanoSuit, for a taxonomically diverse set of plant species. This dataset of images allows the surface features of various plants to be analyzed and thus provides a further complementary morphological profile.

https://openalex.org/W3022665707,"Objectives In a previous analysis of a post-myocardial infarction (MI) cohort, abnormally high systemic vascular resistances (SVR) were shown to be frequently revealed by MRI during the healing period, independently of MI severity, giving evidence of vascular dysfunction and limiting further recovery of cardiac function. The present ancillary and exploratory analysis of the same cohort was aimed at characterizing those patients suffering from high SVR remotely from MI with a large a panel of cardiovascular MRI parameters and blood biomarkers. Methods MRI and blood sampling were performed 2–4 days after a reperfused MI and 6 months thereafter in 121 patients. SVR were monitored with a phase-contrast MRI sequence and patients with abnormally high SVR at 6-months were characterized through MRI parameters and blood biomarkers, including Galectin-3, an indicator of cardiovascular inflammation and fibrosis after MI. SVR were normal at 6-months in 90 patients (SVR-) and abnormally high in 31 among whom 21 already had high SVR at the acute phase (SVR++) while 10 did not (SVR+). Results When compared with SVR-, both SVR+ and SVR++ exhibited lower recovery in cardiac function from baseline to 6-months, while baseline levels of Galectin-3 were significantly different in both SVR+ (median: 14.4 (interquartile range: 12.3–16.7) ng.mL-1) and SVR++ (13.0 (11.7–19.4) ng.mL-1) compared to SVR- (11.7 (9.8–13.5) ng.mL-1, both p < 0.05). Plasma Galectin-3 was an independent baseline predictor of high SVR at 6-months (p = 0.002), together with the baseline levels of SVR and left ventricular end-diastolic volume, whereas indices of MI severity and left ventricular function were not. In conclusion, plasma Galectin-3 predicts a deleterious vascular dysfunction affecting post-MI patients, an observation that could lead to consider new therapeutic targets if confirmed through dedicated prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W3022227621,"OpenFlow makes a network highly flexible and fast-evolving by separating control and data planes. The control plane thus becomes responsive to changes in topology and load balancing requirements. OpenFlow also offers a new approach to handle security threats accurately and responsively. Therefore, it is used as an innovative firewall that acts as a first-hop security to protect networks against malicious users. However, the firewall provided by OpenFlow suffers from Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) fragmentation, which can be used to bypass the OpenFlow firewall. The OpenFlow firewall cannot identify the message payload unless the switch implements IPv6 fragment reassembly. This study tests the IPv6 fragmented packets that can evade the OpenFlow firewall, and proposes a new mechanism to guard against attacks carried out by malicious users to exploit IPv6 fragmentation loophole in OpenFlow networks. The proposed mechanism is evaluated in a simulated environment by using six scenarios, and results exhibit that the proposed mechanism effectively fixes the loophole and successfully prevents the abuse of IPv6 fragmentation in OpenFlow networks."

Prior studies have addressed whether the traumatic experience itself or adult psychopathology is linked to these limitations. To approach this question, individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and healthy individuals with and without a history of child abuse were investigated. We used global positioning system (GPS) tracking to study temporal and spatial limitations in the participants’ real-life activity space over the course of one week. The sample consisted of 228 female participants: 150 women with PTSD and emotional instability with a history of child abuse, 35 mentally healthy women with a history of child abuse (healthy trauma controls, HTC) and 43 mentally healthy women without any traumatic experiences in their past (healthy controls, HC). Both traumatized groups—i.e. the PTSD and the HTC group—had smaller movement radii than the HC group on the weekends, but neither spent significantly less time away from home than HC. Some differences between PTSD and HC in movement radius seem to be related to correlates of PTSD psychopathology, like depression and physical health. Yet group differences between HTC and HC in movement radius remained even when contextual and individual health variables were included in the model, indicating specific effects of traumatic experiences on activity space. Experiences of child abuse could limit activity space later in life, regardless of whether PTSD develops."
https://openalex.org/W3022006680,"A modern color filter array (CFA) output is rendered into the final output image using a demosaicing algorithm. During this process, the rendered image is affected by optical and carrier cross talk of the CFA pattern and demosaicing algorithm. Although many CFA patterns have been proposed thus far, an image-quality (IQ) evaluation system capable of comprehensively evaluating the IQ of each CFA pattern has yet to be developed, although IQ evaluation items using local characteristics or specific domain have been created. Hence, we present an IQ metric system to evaluate the IQ performance of CFA patterns. The proposed CFA evaluation system includes proposed metrics such as the moiré robustness using the experimentally determined moiré starting point (MSP) and achromatic reproduction (AR) error, as well as existing metrics such as color accuracy using CIELAB, a color reproduction error using spatial CIELAB, structural information using the structure similarity, the image contrast based on MTF50, structural and color distortion using the mean deviation similarity index (MDSI), and perceptual similarity using Haar wavelet-based perceptual similarity index (HaarPSI). Through our experiment, we confirmed that the proposed CFA evaluation system can assess the IQ for an existing CFA.

https://openalex.org/W3023131958,"Previous research on interlimb coordination has shown that some coordination patterns are more stable than others, and function as attractors in the space of possible phase relations between different rhythmic movements. The canonical coordination patterns, i.e. the two most stable phase relations, are in-phase (0 degree) and anti-phase (180 degrees). Yet, musicians are able to perform other coordination patterns in intrapersonal as well as in interpersonal coordination with remarkable precision. This raises the question of how music experts manage to produce these unstable patterns of movement coordination. In the current study, we invited participants with at least five years of training on a musical instrument. We used an adaptation paradigm to address two factors that may facilitate producing unstable coordination patterns. First, we investigated adaptation in different coordination settings, to test the hypothesis that the lower coupling strength between individuals during joint performance makes it easier to achieve stability outside of the canonical patterns than the stronger coupling during individual bimanual performance. Second, we investigated whether adding to the structure of action effects may support achieving unstable coordination patterns, both intra- and inter-individually. The structure of action effects was strengthened by adding a melodic contour to the action effects, a measure that has been shown to improve the acquisition of bimanual coordination skills. Adaptation performance was measured both in terms of asynchrony and variability thereof. As predicted, we found that producing unstable patterns benefitted from the weaker coupling during joint performance. Surprisingly, the structure of action effects did not help with achieving unstable coordination patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3023335097,"September 10, 1994. Gloria and I were watching our son, Roman Reed, playing his usual outstanding game of football for the Chabot College Gladiators. As a middle linebacker, he had been going one-on-one with a giant 341-pound blocker all night long. Sometimes Roman faded like smoke and went around to make the tackle; sometimes they crashed together like trucks. And then, as Gloria shot video and I took notes, Roman dived in one more time. Above the shock and click of shoulder pads colliding, there was an ugly noise, like a stick breaking, as our son disappeared under a pile of helmeted bodies. The whistle blew. One by one the athletes disentangled themselves from the pileup and ran lightly from the field. All but one. “Don’t worry, Mom,” said Roman, when everyone was gathered around him, as he lay there so still on the grass. “I can’t feel a thing.” At the hospital they told us Roman’s neck was broken, a fracture of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae; he was paralyzed from the shoulders down. A metal plate was inserted to prevent further damage. One doctor gave us a chilling prognosis: “Your son will never walk again, never close his fingers, and almost certainly never be able to father a child.” Roman told him to get out of the room. He refused to accept the doctor’s opinion, and had a banner made: “I can, I will, I shall!” “This is just temporary, Dad,” he told me, one dark night in the hospital. “We will get through this.” If no one had ever been cured of paralysis in the history of the world—well, that just meant that somebody had to go first! A pro football player, New York Jets linebacker Dennis Byrd, had been similarly injured. But Dennis Byrd walked again. He had been injected with Sygen, a substance made from dried cows’ brains, immediately after his injury. He was not cured, but he was better. A clinical trial with Sygen was going on. We tried to enroll Roman, but we missed the entry deadline by one hour. Could we get the medication on our own? I located the scientist (Fred Geisler of Chicago) who invented the drug. He said it might still work, even after the entry time prescribed, and was available from Switzerland. With a doctor’s prescription and a loan on the house, we began the procedure. Six months of heavy-duty therapy and several hundred injections later, Roman had recovered full use of his triceps muscles, and could drive an adapted vehicle. Was it the Sygen that helped him, or the therapy? To this day, I do not know. Gloria had the house remodeled for wheelchair living. She founded a group, the “Ps and Qs” (Paraplegics and Quadriplegics) for parents who knew the struggle and could share practical techniques, such as how to navigate insurance battles. I thought that was everything we could do. But Roman had no interest in giving up. He would not quit, and he would not let me stop either. Could we get the government to fund research to cure paralysis? As the writer of the family, I contacted (literally) every Congressman and Senator in Washington, as well as our local assemblyman, John Dutra (D-Fremont). No one showed interest—until Dutra called me at Horner Junior High School, where I taught English. Would I mind, he said, if they named a bill after my son—calling it the Roman Reed Spinal Cord Injury Research Act of 1999? Would I mind? I screamed and pounded the wall, then ran to the office, got on the intercom, and told the whole school what had just happened. They had no idea what I was talking about, but gathered I was happy about something. That was the end of it, I thought. I could hardly have been more wrong. There were multiple committee hearings at the state Assembly and Senate, all of which had to be passed individually, plus the final votes in each chamber—when then had to be approved by the Governor. On the internet I met wheelchair warriors like Karen Miner, Fran Lopez, and Susan Rotchy. We were inspired by advocate legend Ed Roberts of Berkeley, responsible for curb cuts being put into the streets for wheelchair access—but first he had to invent a way to make his iron lung portable, so he could leave the hospital.“Advocate as if your life depended on it, because it does.” —Ed Roberts Advocacy, that was the answer; to mobilize those with a reason to care: like the families of the one American in five who has a disability. At last our bill was approved by both houses of the California Congress, and Governor Gray Davis signed on the dotted line. “Roman’s Law” had begun. It was only a million dollars a year, later increased to one and a half million, not much perhaps; but it meant scientists like Hans Keirstead could now receive small research grants—one of which led to the nation’s first embryonic stem cell therapy. On March 1, 2002, the official laboratory of the Roman Reed Spinal Cord Injury Research Act was opened, to be overseen by Dr. Oswald Steward at UC Irvine. A paralyzed laboratory rat named Fighter was given an injection of stem cells into her spine—and she walked again. Instead of miserably dragging her hindquarters, she scampered, tail high, across the purple plastic swimming pool play area. I picked her up and held the formerly paralyzed rat in in my hands, feeling the tiny muscles struggling to be free—and this while Roman sat in his wheelchair, a few feet away. It was like touching tomorrow. “You can put her down now, Dad,” my son had to tell me. Christopher Reeve, the paralyzed movie “Superman,” spoke to us over speaker phone, saying, “Oh, to be a rat this day!” My wife Gloria got so excited—she photographed the phone! The Act dispensed 15 million California dollars, also attracting “add-on” funds of roughly $87 million from other sources, like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. But that was couch change compared to the need. Estimates of the number of paralyzed people run as high as five million. The only way Roman had a chance to get better would be if the whole field of regenerative medicine moved forward. But how? I worked as a grassroots coordinator with Senator Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) as she passed America’s first stem cell legislation, Senate Bill 253. But there was a problem. SB 253 contained no funding: no dollars for research. Enter Bob Klein, a real estate developer in Palo Alto, California, and the father of Jordan, a young man with Type 1 diabetes. Do you remember the U.S. invasion of Iraq? Right before it happened, President George W. Bush said he would not consider any more legislation, unless it was supported by both sides, 100%, every Republican and Democrat—impossible, right? Klein and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund (JDRF) organized a massive telephone campaign, asking for (and receiving) every Senator’s vote. The President signed the legislation—authorizing $1.5 billion in federal funding to fight diabetes. Later, an advocate came to Bob and asked him: would he try again and raise another billion—for stem cell research? “No,” said Bob. “Too much?” the advocate asked. “Not enough,” said Bob. “It has to be at least $3 billion.” Always before, Roman and Karen and I had operated with the perfect freedom of a zero budget. We could do anything, as long as it cost no money. Now, there was an actual budget. My first day aboard, there was a pizza-eating meeting, after which I cut up cardboard boxes, backing for the signature gatherers. I went home with a bloodblister on my thumb and joy in my heart. “Let’s send a message,” said Bob. “Let’s gather one million signatures.” The patient advocate community responded. In his power wheelchair, Roman gathered signatures. Gloria and I would stand in front of stores until the managers kicked us out. We learned to be brief, just eight words per person. “Do you support stem cell research?” If they said yes, we said, “Sign here.” If they said no, we moved on. Once an old lady read my sign, “Put stem cells on the ballot.” She waited her turn in line to talk to me—but instead of offering conversation, she spat on my shoe. The campaign hired a security guard after a pipe bomb incident at a stem cell research facility in New Jersey. The Reed family gathered about 2,000 signatures—but another advocate family, the Kaplans, brought in five times as much. Usually, in an initiative involving money, support in the polls begins high and then goes low. Ours started off in a near tie: 45% yes, 43% no—not much margin. But it grew.“Every American family deserves the best medical treatment science can provide.” —George Lakoff, UC Berkeley We gathered support wherever we could, sometimes in surprising places. When Arnold Schwarzenegger came aboard, there were some jokes about The Terminator, but he defended stem cell research ably, as did Sherry Lansing, recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian trophy at the Academy Awards. Officially, the Catholic Church opposed Proposition 71, the California Stem Cells for Research and Cures Act. Priests voicing that political stance were sent to the parochial school my grandson attended. But a group called Catholics for Choice supported us, and a poll showed 72% of Catholics themselves supported early stem cell research, using biological materials that would otherwise be discarded. When the final vote came, it was decisive: 59.1% of the voters said “Yes!” in support of the $3 billion stem cell program. The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) was born. There were still curves ahead, of course. Frivolous lawsuits (including one from “Jane Doe,” a fictitious embryo) blocked our research for nearly 3 years. But Bob Klein found a way. People could loan money to CIRM so it could get started—and if the lawsuits went against us, the money would be considered a donation to research. Imagine going to a bank and asking for a loan—that you might pay back. Bob raised about $40 million that way. (It was later repaid in full, with interest.) And there were other fights to occupy us, in national and international arenas. Trying to protect embryonic stem cell research on a national basis, the bipartisan House Resolution 810 (Castle/Degette) passed both houses of Congress, twice, before President George W. Bush vetoed it—both times. Under pressure from patient advocates and their friends in Congress, President Bush did allow a very limited number of embryonic stem cell lines to be used for research. But there would be no more after that, ever, he said. In the United Nations, Bush’s emissaries tried to pass a world-wide law banning therapeutic cloning (copying cells that might heal wounds), lumping them together with the universally opposed reproductive cloning (copying people, never done).The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) was born. We found an email address that reached every U.N. ambassador, and contacted them all, again and again. The anti-research ban passed—but in a toothless form, voluntary. Jumping ahead to March 9th, 2009, the advocates went to Washington—Roman, Gloria, Bob Klein, and I—and cheered ourselves hoarse, as President Obama, a friend of science, reversed the Bush stem cell restrictions. And one glorious day in 2007, I had the honor of delivering the patient advocate’s acceptance speech as Governor Schwarzenegger loaned CIRM $150 million, enough to get well and truly started. The CIRM was open for business. How did it work? Every grant proposal was evaluated by scientists drawn from an out-of-state pool, the Grants Working Group. Then, CIRM’s in-house scientists would go over the thinned-out proposals. They could recommend but not decide. The proposals would then be offered at a meeting of the CIRM board of directors, the Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee (ICOC). Members of the public could speak. I have probably taken advantage of that more than anyone else. If I liked a proposal, I would write out a 3-minute speech and babble away in support of it. I have done this dozens of times; sometimes I won, sometimes not. But what an opportunity—to influence a decision on millions of dollars of research funding. Even after the funding was allocated, the FDA approval process was and is lengthy and difficult. For instance, the stem cell procedure begun by Roman’s law has involved more than 20,000 pages of correspondence and 18 years of testing. The process is slow and careful, necessarily; above all, no one must be made worse. Researchers faced a mountain of difficulties; every disease or disability being challenged was a chronic condition: “chronic” meaning long-lasting or incurable. For instance, the world’s first mention of paralysis was written in hieroglyphics on the walls of an Egyptian tomb. Of paralyzed soldiers, it said, “Deny them water, let them die; there is nothing that can be done.” For centuries that was the general opinion, that cure was impossible. But today, paralyzed people have recovered upper body function after CIRM-assisted clinical trials, using embryonic stem cell procedures pioneered by Roman’s law. And that is just one example of the chronic diseases CIRM is fighting, step by careful step: heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, leukemia, and much more. The size of the problem is staggering. Last year alone, 2019, America spent almost $3 trillion on chronic disease—stacked in dollar bills, that pile would reach the moon—but all those federal dollars do not cure suffering people; they just maintain them in their misery. We need cure, not just endlessly expensive care. Yet change may come. Let me tell you a story. (And note that this story is used with permission.) At last year’s meeting of the International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), I had dinner with the Vaccaro family, including their lively 7-year-old daughter, Evie, engrossed in a game of Battleship with a scientist. Evie was losing and did not seem too happy about it. It was an accident, I am sure, when she spilled her milk on the scientist’s shoes. Why does this matter? Do you remember a John Travolta movie called, “The Boy in the Plastic Bubble”? A young man had a disease, Severe Combined Immune Disorder (SCID), which meant that he had no functioning immune system. It was a death sentence. Germs the rest of us ignored could kill him. He lived in a sterile world, behind a wall of plastic sheeting. In the end, he seemed to get better, and rode off on a horse with his girlfriend. In real life, the young man died. His name was David Vitter, and I spoke with his mother. That little girl, Evie, had also been diagnosed with SCID. But her parents had the good fortune to cross paths with Donald Kohn of UCLA. Their child was able to join his clinical trial. Today, she can run around outside, happy and healthy. The CIRM-funded stem cell/gene therapy procedure literally cured that little girl—and 50 more like her. That same “remove, repair, replace” procedure—remove bone marrow, repair bad genes, replace with the aid of stem cells—might also be used to fight a devastating disease, sickle cell anemia. Tests are now being done to see if this is possible. There was more, much more. When CIRM began, one scientist warned us not to get our hopes up, saying we would be lucky to bring even one stem cell product or procedure all the way to clinical trials to be tested on human beings. CIRM has 82 human trials, completed, ongoing, or shortly to commence. On August 22, 2018, I and other advocates spoke before the California Assembly Select Committee on Biotechnology, urging the continuation of this great program: “Today, thanks to the 7.2 million voters who authorized the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, we have something better than hope; we have results, accomplishments, people made well—and a systematic way to fight chronic disease.” Bob Klein had advice on the value of partnerships and how they could move research advancements: “It is critical for patient advocates to befriend a scientist working in the field of their condition. If the public hears a scientist ask for funding, they may think he/she is acting out of self-interest. But when a patient backs them up, the seriousness of that scientist’s commitment becomes clear.” Today CIRM’s funding is almost gone. California must decide to renew the program with new funding—or sit idly by and watch it die. As this is written, Gloria Jean, my beloved wife of 50 years, has just died of pancreatic cancer. It was a difficult parting. And one of the last things she said was, “The stem cell research must go on. No one should have to suffer like this.” With every fiber of my being I want that wish to come true: that our state will extend the program’s funding with an additional $5.5 billion. California’s voters should be proud of what their vision has accomplished. They should look closely at what has been done already, and how close we are to so much more. Bob Klein is still leading the effort to advance regenerative medicine, though tragically his son Jordan has died of complications to diabetes. And Roman? It has been 25 years since his accident, and he is still fighting. Defying the doctor’s predictions, he has three children: Roman Jr., Jason, and Katherine. The RR Act was renewed by Governor Schwarzenegger and passed unanimously by the Assembly and Senate. Unfortunately, it was vetoed twice by Governor Brown, for reasons not clear. Roman will doubtless try again with the help (we hope!) of Governor Gavin Newsom. Roman has helped other states set up similar paralysis research programs, like the T.J. Atkinson Act, in Alabama. We have not quit. It is my hope that Roman will fulfill the great prediction made by Christopher Reeve, who said, “One day, Roman and I will stand up from our wheelchairs and walk away from them forever.” Cure did not come in time for the paralyzed Superman, but the flame of his faith still lights our way. We will, as he said, “Go forward!”—and we will prevail."
