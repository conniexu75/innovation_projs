They evince microenvironment-directed phenotypes that support host defense and tissue homeostasis. Chakarov et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing and fate-mapping of murine lung RTMs to interrogate RTM-subset heterogeneity, interrelationships, and ontogeny (see the Perspective by Mildner and Yona). In addition to alveolar macrophages, they identified two different interstitial macrophage populations. One population mostly abutted nerve fibers; the other population preferentially localized near blood vessels and appeared to support vessel integrity and inhibit inflammatory cell infiltration into tissues.

This effect is an important moderator of climate change, but can we count on it to remain as strong in the future? Gruber et al. calculated the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 for the interval from 1994 to 2007, which continued as expected. They also observed clear regional deviations from this pattern, suggesting that there is no guarantee that uptake will remain as robust with time. Science , this issue p. 1193"

However, virtually all piezoelectric materials are ceramics, which are far from ideal for applications requiring flexible sensors.

Emerging theories hypothesize that it involves the same hippocampal mechanisms that support self-localization and memory for locations. Yet limited direct evidence supports the link between planning and the hippocampal place map. We addressed this by investigating model-based planning and place memory in healthy controls and epilepsy patients treated using unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy with hippocampal resection. Both functions were impaired in the patient group. Specifically, the planning impairment was related to right hippocampal lesion size, controlling for overall lesion size. Furthermore, although planning and boundary-driven place memory covaried in the control group, this relationship was attenuated in patients, consistent with both functions relying on the same structure in the healthy brain. These findings clarify both the neural mechanism of model-based planning and the scope of hippocampal contributions to behavior.

These findings clarify both the neural mechanism of model-based planning and the scope of hippocampal contributions to behavior. Using knowledge of task contingencies, humans and other animals can plan novel courses of action, such as trajectories through a maze. Although the neural substrates for such “model-based” planning are poorly understood, this ability is often viewed as similar to other functions supported by the hippocampus, like representing and remembering locations in space. Both model-based planning (Tolman, 1948Tolman E.C. Cognitive maps in rats and men.Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3663) Google Scholar) and place memory (O’keefe and Nadel, 1978O’keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, 1978Google Scholar) are often described as requiring “cognitive maps” of the environment or task structure and are contrasted against habitual response-based behaviors that depend on the basal ganglia. Still, despite the commonalities, these functions are distinct in principle, and it is unclear whether they actually share a common neural mechanism and, if so, what that mechanism is. Research into hippocampal spatial cognition most clearly emphasizes localization: determining one’s position in allocentric space. This function is most famously exemplified by location-selective neural responses in the hippocampus (O’keefe and Nadel, 1978O’keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, 1978Google Scholar) and behaviorally operationalized using spatial tasks, such as the Morris water maze (MWM) (Morris et al., 1982Morris R.G.M. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N. O’Keefe J. Place navigation impaired in rats with hippocampal lesions.Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar), where rodents have to find and remember the location of a hidden platform in an open arena. This type of “place memory,” keyed to allocentric configurations of cues like boundaries, is distinguished from more landmark-based strategies, such as egocentric stimulus-response strategies (e.g., turn left or right), which rely more on the basal ganglia (McDonald and White, 1994McDonald R.J.

An analogous dissociation between hippocampal and basal-ganglia-dependent memory has been demonstrated in humans using fMRI in virtual spatial tasks (Hartley et al., 2003Hartley T. Maguire E.A.

By contrast, research into planning investigates how organisms use knowledge of task contingencies, like action outcomes and state transitions, to evaluate actions by mental simulation. Experiments probing such functions, including reward devaluation in operant lever pressing (Adams and Dickinson, 1981Adams C.D. Dickinson A.

This distinction seems to parallel the place versus response memory dichotomy from spatial cognition (Poldrack and Packard, 2003Poldrack R.A. Packard M.G.

Integrating memories to guide decisions.Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 2015; 5: 85-90Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, model-free learning, like landmark-based stimulus response strategies in some spatial tasks, is well captured by theories of dopamine and the basal ganglia (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5895) Google Scholar, Bayer and Glimcher, 2005Bayer H.M. Glimcher P.W.

It is less clear what neural mechanisms are responsible for model-based planning. There are, however, a number of suggestive reasons to suspect it shares a common hippocampal substrate with place memory (Hirsh, 1974Hirsh R.

Hippocampal function, of course, extends beyond spatial cognition to support declarative memory and, notably, a role in encoding the relationships among environmental stimuli (Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2004Eichenbaum H.

Knowing such relations is critical to building a model of task contingencies. Tests of relational encoding have even relied on tasks that are similar in logic to probes for model-based planning, like transitive inference or acquired equivalence (Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997Dusek J.A.

Shohamy D. Preference by association: how memory mechanisms in the hippocampus bias decisions.Science. 2012; 338: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hippocampus has been implicated in the ability to imagine or simulate future events, a function that may be critical to model-based planning (Hassabis et al., 2007Hassabis D. Kumaran D. Vann S.D. Maguire E.A. Patients with hippocampal amnesia cannot imagine new experiences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hippocampal contributions to the episodic simulation of specific and general future events.Hippocampus. 2011; 21: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Spatial navigation studies have further demonstrated that the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal areas, in addition to the current location, encode other variables that are relevant to planning, such as boundaries or the identity, direction, and distance to a goal (Spiers and Maguire, 2007Spiers H.J. Maguire E.A. A navigational guidance system in the human brain.Hippocampus. 2007; 17: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Viard et al., 2011Viard A. Doeller C.F. Hartley T. Bird C.M.

Non-local place-cell firing, such as preplay of locations ahead of the animal, has also been proposed to support planning by mental simulation of candidate routes, drawing on a cognitive model or map of the world (Johnson and Redish, 2007Johnson A.

Prioritized memory access explains planning and hippocampal replay.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). At the same time, there is a surprising lack of direct evidence for hippocampal involvement in model-based planning. For predominant rodent models of model-based behavior, including outcome devaluation and contingency degradation in operant lever pressing, hippocampal lesions have negligible effects (Corbit and Balleine, 2000Corbit L.H. Balleine B.W. The role of the hippocampus in instrumental conditioning.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4233-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Corbit et al., 2002Corbit L.H. Ostlund S.B. Balleine B.W. Sensitivity to instrumental contingency degradation is mediated by the entorhinal cortex and its efferents via the dorsal hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10976-10984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One exception is a recent rodent study in which hippocampal lesions impaired model-based planning in a multi-step decision task (Miller et al., 2017Miller K.J. Botvinick M.M. Brody C.D. Dorsal hippocampus plays a causal role in model-based planning.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/096594Crossref Google Scholar). However, the extensive training needed to teach animals such sequential decision tasks may elicit model-free strategies that only mimic the signatures of planning in more lightly trained humans (Akam et al., 2015Akam T. Costa R. Dayan P. Simple plans or sophisticated habits? State, transition and learning interactions in the two-step task.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004648Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Economides et al., 2015Economides M. Kurth-Nelson Z. Lübbert A. Guitart-Masip M. Dolan R.J. Model-based reasoning in humans becomes automatic with training.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004463Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Even seemingly model-based rodent behavior (Miller et al., 2017Miller K.J. Botvinick M.M. Brody C.D. Dorsal hippocampus plays a causal role in model-based planning.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/096594Crossref Google Scholar) could thus rely on the hippocampus for different reasons. Finally, with few exceptions (Simon and Daw, 2011Simon D.A. Daw N.D. Neural correlates of forward planning in a spatial decision task in humans.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5526-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), little evidence links hippocampal activity in human neuroimaging or rodent place cell preplay to planning in tasks specifically designed to identify choice strategies that require knowledge of task contingencies. We therefore sought to directly test the hypotheses that model-based planning uses a hippocampal mechanism in humans and whether this substrate is shared with boundary-driven place memory. To this end, we studied the performance on a model-based planning task (Daw et al., 2011Daw N.D. Gershman S.J. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J. Model-based influences on humans’ choices and striatal prediction errors.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1204-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and a spatial memory task (Doeller et al., 2008Doeller C.F. King J.A. Burgess N. Parallel striatal and hippocampal systems for landmarks and boundaries in spatial memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5915-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) in healthy controls and patients with medically intractable epilepsy, treated by unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) with hippocampal resection. We investigated whether damage to the temporal lobe impaired model-based planning and boundary-driven place memory and how it affected the relationship between them. If the hippocampus is a common neural substrate for both functions, we expected hippocampal damage to impair performance on both tasks. Furthermore, a common substrate could lead to correlated performance across the tasks, but this correlation should itself be attenuated if that substrate is impaired by hippocampal damage. Finally, because the lesions also affected overlying cortex, we explored to what extent performance in either task was related specifically to the extent of damage to hippocampus on either side, controlling for the overall extent of the lesion. We recruited 19 epilepsy patients, treated with unilateral ATL, i.e., surgical removal of the anterior temporal lobe on one side, and 19 healthy controls (see STAR Methods). Patients and controls displayed no significant group differences in IQ (t36 = 0.2200; p = 0.8271), age (t36 = −0.7760; p = 0.4428), or number of males versus females (z = −0.3261; p = 0.7444). For 10 out of 19 patients, ATL was right lateralized. There were no significant differences between the right- and left-lateralized ATL groups in IQ (t = −0.5295; p = 0.6033), age (t17 = 1.0876; p = 0.2919), or number of males versus females (z = −0.6752; p = 0.4995). Individual lesion masks, derived from post-surgical structural brain scans normalized to the 1-mm Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (Figure 1; STAR Methods) were used to estimate the standardized total lesion size of each patient. Total lesion size in the right-lateralized ATL patient group (mean = 65,314 voxels; SE = 2,791 voxels) was found to be significantly larger (t17 = −2.6103; p = 0.0183) than in the left-lateralized ATL patient group (mean = 40,536 voxel; SE = 2,296 voxels). Each patient’s lesion mask was also compared to the Harvard-Oxford Brain Lexicon (p > 0.5) in order to estimate what percentage of the hippocampus had been resected (see STAR Methods). Mean hippocampal lesion size estimated in the right-lateralized ATL patient group (mean = 2,791 voxels; SE = 321 voxels) was not significantly larger (t17 = −1.1124; p = 0.2814) than in the left-lateralized ATL patient group (mean = 2,296 voxels; SE = 302 voxels). The mean hippocampal lesion sizes corresponded to 62.8% (SE = 7.2) and 53.7% (SE = 7.1) of the hippocampus resected for the right and left ATL groups, respectively. Participants completed 200 trials of a two-step Markov decision task (Daw et al., 2011Daw N.D. Gershman S.J. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J. Model-based influences on humans’ choices and striatal prediction errors.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1204-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) designed to quantify the reliance on model-based and model-free strategies (see STAR Methods). The mean number of completed trials was 195.3 (SE = 2.1), with no difference between control and patient groups (t38 = 1.2515; p = 0.2188). The mean number of rewards received was 107.9 (SE = 2.6), also, with no significant difference between control and patient group (t36 = −0.0399; p = 0.9684). In general, rewards in this task are by design highly stochastic and not sensitive to differences in strategy. On each trial, the participant first made a choice between two spaceships. One spaceship most commonly (p = 0.7) transitioned to the purple planet and otherwise made a rare transition (p = 0.3) to the red planet. For the other spaceship, probabilities were reversed. The participant then made a choice between two planet-specific aliens, each associated with a unique, slowly drifting probability of reward (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows markers of both as a function of group, estimated from a factorial logistic regression (Table S1), which predicts choosing the same spaceship as on the previous trial. Model-free learning is signaled by a main effect of reward, i.e., a tendency to repeat choosing the spaceship that led to reward, whereas in model-based learning, choice of spaceship is mediated by expectations about the planets to which it leads, indicated by an interaction between reward and whether a rare or common transition occurred on the last trial. If, for instance, a reward is received but following a rare transition, a model-based agent should be less likely to repeat the choice of spaceship on the next trial. The difference in these effects measures the relative strength of model-based versus model-free choice. The regression also controls for additional nuisance explanatory factors, age and IQ. The expression of model-based versus model-free strategies differed significantly by group, with controls showing a relatively even mixture of strategies (similar to previous reports using this task), but patients skewed away from model-based planning toward model-free learning. The relative reliance on model-based over model-free strategies, calculated by taking the difference between these effects, differed significantly between groups, indicating a specific strategy change rather than a general impairment (z = 2.028; p = 0.043). This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that hippocampal damage in the ATL lesion group specifically affects the use of internal models or maps of task contingencies. For simplicity, the above factorial analysis only considers the effect of the preceding trial’s events on each trial’s choice. To verify that our results were not dependent on this assumption, and in keeping with previous work (Daw et al., 2011Daw N.D. Gershman S.J. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J.

The results recapitulate the findings from the regression: chiefly, a significant interaction of reinforcement learning strategy and experimental group such that patients are biased away from model-based and toward model-free strategies (p = 0.036). In addition, in this analysis (here going beyond the simpler regression analysis), the estimated strength of model-free learning is itself significantly higher in the patient group than the control group (p = 0.043). The remaining parameters of the computational model did not differ significantly between groups. Participants completed a spatial task (Doeller et al., 2008Doeller C.F. King J.A. Burgess N. Parallel striatal and hippocampal systems for landmarks and boundaries in spatial memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5915-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), where on each of 64 trials, they had navigate in first person (Figure 4, left) to indicate from memory the correct location of one of four objects in a virtual arena (see STAR Methods). The mean number of completed trials was 61.3 (SE = 0.5) with no significant difference between control and patient group in number of completed trials (t36 = −0.2882; p = 0.7749). For two of the objects, correct locations were defined in relation to distal boundary cues around the arena, and for the other two objects, correct locations were defined in relation to a landmark inside the arena (Figure 4, middle). Trials were presented in four blocks consisting of 16 trials each. Within the blocks, the landmark location was fixed with respect to the boundary cues, but between the blocks, the landmark moved (Figure 4, right). Participants were not instructed about the difference between landmark and boundary objects or about the block-wise landmark movements. The movements of the landmarks with respect to the boundary cues serve to dissociate spatial memory performance based on either type of cue. Given previous results (Pearce et al., 1998Pearce J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2921087491,"A comprehensive study to assess quality and outcomes of care for Veterans with upper limb amputation is needed. This paper presents methods and summary findings from a national survey of Veterans with upper limb amputation.After completion of a pilot study to develop and refine methods, computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with 808 Veterans with upper limb amputation (response rate = 47.7%; cooperation rate = 63.3%).Respondents were 776 unilateral and 32 bilateral amputees, 97.5% male, mean age 63.3 (sd 14.1). Prostheses were used by 60% unilateral and 91% bilateral, the majority used body powered devices. Prostheses were used ≥8 hours/day by 52% unilateral and 76% bilateral. Prosthetic training was received by 71% unilateral and 59% bilateral. Mean prosthetic satisfaction was 3.9 (sd 0.6) and 3.8 (sd 0.7) as measured by TAPES; and 25.0 (sd 5.1) and 25.7 (sd 4.5) as measured by OPUS CSD for unilateral and bilateral respectively. Mean perceived disability (measured by QuickDASH) scores were 49.5 (sd 20.7) for unilateral and 34.7 (sd 22.0) for bilateral. VR-12 PCS scores were below population norms. The majority reported contralateral limb pain, musculoskeletal conditions, back and neck pain. Phantom limb pain was reported in 83.4% of unilateral and 68.8% of bilateral, and residual limb pain in 65.1% of unilateral and 68.8% of bilateral. Most, (81.8% unilateral, 84.4% bilateral) had been to a Veterans Affairs medical center (VA) for amputation care, while 57% of unilateral and 81.3% of bilateral had been to a VA amputation clinic.Veterans with upper limb amputation have moderately impaired physical functioning. Prosthesis use rates were lower than previously reported. Although satisfied with their prostheses, nearly half used them ≤8 hours/day. Rates of musculoskeletal problems, phantom and residual limb pain were higher than previously reported. A substantial proportion never received prosthetic training, or VA amputation care."
https://openalex.org/W2922324150,"Neuroligins, postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules that are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, are extensively studied, but fundamental questions about their functions remain. Using in vivo replacement strategies in quadruple conditional knockout mice of all neuroligins to avoid heterodimerization artifacts, we show, in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, that neuroligin-1 performs two key functions in excitatory synapses by distinct molecular mechanisms. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent LTP requires trans-synaptic binding of postsynaptic neuroligin-1 to presynaptic β-neurexins but not the cytoplasmic sequences of neuroligins. In contrast, postsynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated responses involve a neurexin-independent mechanism that requires the neuroligin-1 cytoplasmic sequences. Strikingly, deletion of neuroligins blocked the spine expansion associated with LTP, as monitored by two-photon imaging; this block involved a mechanism identical to that of the role of neuroligin-1 in NMDAR-dependent LTP. Our data suggest that neuroligin-1 performs two mechanistically distinct signaling functions and that neurolign-1-mediated trans-synaptic cell adhesion signaling critically regulates LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2921088799,"We investigated the presence of non-neuromuscular phenotypes in patients affected by Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a disorder caused by a mutation in the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) gene, and whether these phenotypes may be clinically detectable prior to clinical signs of neuromuscular degeneration and therefore independent of muscle weakness.We utilized a de-identified database of insurance claims to explore the health of 1,038 SMA patients compared to controls. Two analyses were performed: (1) claims from the entire insurance coverage window; and (2) for SMA patients, claims prior to diagnosis of any neuromuscular disease or evidence of major neuromuscular degeneration to increase the chance that phenotypes could be attributed directly to reduced SMN levels. Logistic regression was used to determine whether phenotypes were diagnosed at significantly different rates between SMA patients and controls and to obtain covariate-adjusted odds ratios.Results from the entire coverage window revealed a broad spectrum of phenotypes that are differentially diagnosed in SMA subjects compared to controls. Moreover, data from SMA patients prior to their first clinical signs of neuromuscular degeneration revealed numerous non-neuromuscular phenotypes including defects within the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, metabolic, reproductive, and skeletal systems. Furthermore, our data provide evidence of a potential ordering of disease progression beginning with these non-neuromuscular phenotypes.Our data point to a direct relationship between early, detectable non-neuromuscular symptoms and SMN deficiency. Our findings are particularly important for evaluating the efficacy of SMN-increasing therapies for SMA, comparing the effectiveness of local versus systemically delivered therapeutics, and determining the optimal therapeutic treatment window prior to irreversible neuromuscular damage."
https://openalex.org/W2920830240,"Virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon-inducible (viperin) is a radical SAM enzyme that plays a multifaceted role in the cellular antiviral response. Viperin has recently been shown to catalyze the SAM-dependent formation of 3′-deoxy-3′,4′-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), which inhibits some viral RNA polymerases. Viperin is also implicated in regulating Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) as part of the Toll-like receptor-7 and -9 (TLR7/9) innate immune signaling pathways. In these pathways, the poly-ubiquitination of IRAK1 by TRAF6 is necessary to activate IRAK1, which then phosphorylates downstream targets and ultimately leads to the production of type I interferons. That viperin is a component of these pathways suggested that its enzymatic activity might be regulated by interactions with partner proteins. To test this idea, we have reconstituted the interactions between viperin, IRAK1, and TRAF6 by transiently expressing these enzymes in HEK 293T cells. We show that IRAK1 and TRAF6 increase viperin activity ∼10-fold to efficiently catalyze the radical-mediated dehydration of CTP to ddhCTP. Furthermore, we found that TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of IRAK1 requires the association of viperin with both IRAK1 and TRAF6. Ubiquitination appears to depend on structural changes in viperin induced by SAM binding, but, significantly, does not require catalytically active viperin. We conclude that the synergistic activation of viperin and IRAK1 provides a mechanism that couples innate immune signaling with the production of the antiviral nucleotide ddhCTP.

https://openalex.org/W2922490554,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a key neuronal receptor for β-amyloid oligomers (AβO), mediating their neurotoxicity, which contributes to the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Similarly to the amyloid precursor protein (APP), PrPC is proteolytically cleaved from the cell surface by a disintegrin and metalloprotease, ADAM10. We hypothesized that ADAM10-modulated PrPC shedding would alter the cellular binding and cytotoxicity of AβO. Here, we found that in human neuroblastoma cells, activation of ADAM10 with the muscarinic agonist carbachol promotes PrPC shedding and reduces the binding of AβO to the cell surface, which could be blocked with an ADAM10 inhibitor. Conversely, siRNA-mediated ADAM10 knockdown reduced PrPC shedding and increased AβO binding, which was blocked by the PrPC-specific antibody 6D11. The retinoic acid receptor analog acitretin, which up-regulates ADAM10, also promoted PrPC shedding and decreased AβO binding in the neuroblastoma cells and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons. Pretreatment with acitretin abolished activation of Fyn kinase and prevented an increase in reactive oxygen species caused by AβO binding to PrPC. Besides blocking AβO binding and toxicity, acitretin also increased the nonamyloidogenic processing of APP. However, in the iPSC-derived neurons, Aβ and other amyloidogenic processing products did not exhibit a reciprocal decrease upon acitretin treatment. These results indicate that by promoting the shedding of PrPC in human neurons, ADAM10 activation prevents the binding and cytotoxicity of AβO, revealing a potential therapeutic benefit of ADAM10 activation in AD.

Another approach has been to target Fyn directly with a specific inhibitor to rescue the memory deficits in an AD mouse model (22Kaufman A.C. Salazar S.V. Haas L.T. Yang J. Kostylev M.A. Jeng A.T.

Neurol. 2015; 77 (25707991): 953-97110.1002/ana.24394Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These approaches highlight that targeting PrPC or other components of the AβO-PrPC signaling complex may have therapeutic potential in AD. Aβ peptides are generated when the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by the sequential action of the β-secretase (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1; BACE1) and the multisubunit γ-secretase complex in the amyloidogenic pathway (23Andrew R.J. Kellett K.A. Thinakaran G. Hooper N.M. A Greek tragedy: the growing complexity of Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein proteolysis.J. Biol.

Alternatively, APP can be cleaved via the nonamyloidogenic pathway through the action of the α-secretase, a disintegrin and metalloprotease ADAM10, precluding the formation of the Aβ peptide and generating an alternative soluble fragment sAPPα that has neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties (23Andrew R.J. Kellett K.A. Thinakaran G. Hooper N.M. A Greek tragedy: the growing complexity of Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein proteolysis.J. Biol.

It is generally assumed that there is competition between the α- and β-secretases for their substrate APP, resulting in a reciprocal relationship between the amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic APP-processing pathways. In support of this reciprocal relationship, neuronal overexpression of ADAM10 in APPV717I transgenic mice increased the secretion of sAPPα and reduced the formation of Aβ peptides (24Postina R.

The ectodomain shedding of multiple cell surface proteins can be promoted by a variety of compounds.

The vitamin A analog, acitretin, promoted the α-secretase cleavage of APP by stimulating the transcription of ADAM10 via interaction with retinoic acid–responsive elements within the ADAM10 promoter (30Tippmann F.

Here, we have used human neuroblastoma cells and iPSC-derived cortical neurons to show that carbachol and acitretin promote the shedding of cell surface PrPC through activation of ADAM10. The resulting reduction of cell surface PrPC leads to a concomitant reduction in the binding of AβO. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of ADAM10 resulted in increased cell surface PrPC and a corresponding increase in AβO binding that could be blocked with the PrPC antibody, 6D11. AβO binding to PrPC activated Fyn kinase and caused an increase in ROS that could be blocked by promoting the shedding of PrPC with acitretin. We also report that although acitretin reciprocally modulated the amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic processing of APP in neuroblastoma cells and rat hippocampal neurons, no such reciprocal relationship was observed in the human iPSC-derived neurons.

Neurodegener. 2011; 6 (21619641): 3610.1186/1750-1326-6-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that activation of ADAM10 would reduce AβO binding to cells due to shedding of its cell surface receptor PrPC. Initially, the muscarinic agonist carbachol, which increases the shedding of multiple cell surface proteins, including APP, was employed (28Parkin E.T. Trew A. Christie G. Faller A. Mayer R. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Structure-activity relationship of hydroxamate-based inhibitors on the secretases that cleave the amyloid precursor protein, angiotensin converting enzyme, CD23, and pro-tumor necrosis factor-α.Biochemistry. 2002; 41 (11939793): 4972-498110.1021/bi015936eCrossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effect of carbachol on PrPC and APP shedding was monitored by detection of the soluble fragments, sPrPC and sAPPα, respectively, in the media fraction. Treatment of human SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrPC with carbachol promoted the shedding of full-length glycosylated PrPC by 1.4-fold and the α-secretase cleavage of APP by 1.5-fold (Fig. 1, A–C). To establish that carbachol was acting via activation of ADAM10, the cells were incubated with the ADAM10-selective inhibitor, GI254023X (34Hussain I. Hawkins J. Shikotra A. Riddell D.R. Faller A. Dingwall C. Characterization of the ectodomain shedding of the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1).J. Biol.

On its own, the ADAM10 inhibitor significantly reduced the amount of sPrPC in the media by 83% (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with ADAM10 being the major constitutive PrPC sheddase (32Altmeppen H.C. Prox J. Puig B. Kluth M.A. Bernreuther C. Thurm D. Jorissen E. Petrowitz B. Bartsch U. De Strooper B. Saftig P. Glatzel M.

Neurodegener. 2011; 6 (21619641): 3610.1186/1750-1326-6-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the presence of the ADAM10 inhibitor, carbachol failed to cause an increase in the shedding of PrPC (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that carbachol was promoting the shedding of PrPC via activation of ADAM10. Similar to its effect on the shedding of PrPC, the ADAM10 inhibitor significantly reduced sAPPα in the media by 85% and blocked the increase in sAPPα caused by carbachol (Fig. 1, A and C). Treatment with carbachol and the GI254023X (GI) inhibitor did not significantly alter ADAM10 expression (Fig. 1D). Consistent with increasing the shedding of PrPC, carbachol treatment resulted in a decrease in cell surface expression of PrPC evaluated by ImageStream imaging cytometry (Fig. 1E). This analysis demonstrated a decrease in high-expressing PrPC cells in a population of cells treated with carbachol when compared with the control population. The decrease in cell surface PrPC was confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy, where carbachol treatment of the cells caused a significant decrease (40%) in the amount of PrPC localized to the cell surface (Fig. 1, F and G). AβOs were prepared and characterized as described previously (11Rushworth J.V. Griffiths H.H. Watt N.T. Hooper N.M. Prion protein-mediated toxicity of amyloid-β oligomers requires lipid rafts and the transmembrane LRP1.J. Biol.

Treatment of the cells with carbachol resulted in a significant decrease (62%) in the amount of AβO bound to the cell surface (Fig. 1, F and G). In addition to promoting the shedding of the entire ectodomain of PrPC through cleavage near the site of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attachment (31Taylor D.R. Parkin E.T. Cocklin S.L. Ault J.R. Ashcroft A.E. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Role of ADAMs in the ectodomain shedding and conformational conversion of the prion protein.J. Biol.

Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. De Strooper B. Grassi J. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. The disintegrins ADAM10 and TACE contribute to the constitutive and phorbol ester-regulated normal cleavage of the cellular prion protein.J. Biol.

The α-cleavage of PrPC releases an N-terminal fragment, termed N1, and leaves a C-terminal fragment, C1, tethered to the membrane via the GPI anchor. To establish whether carbachol also promoted the cleavage of PrPC within its ectodomain, samples were deglycosylated so that the C1 fragment could be detected and distinguished from unglycosylated full-length PrPC. There was no change in the ratio of full-length PrPC to C1 fragment when cells were incubated with carbachol (Fig. 1, H and I), indicating that carbachol reduces AβO binding by promoting the shedding of full-length PrPC and not by promoting cleavage within its ectodomain. To confirm that ADAM10 was responsible for altering AβO binding through modulating the cell surface level of PrPC, ADAM10 was knocked down using siRNA in the SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrPC. For these experiments, we used both a SMARTpool siRNA containing four target siRNAs (Dharmacon) shown in Fig. 2 and a single, independent siRNA (Ambion) shown in Fig. 3. In the ADAM10 siRNA-treated cells, there was a significant reduction in the pro and mature forms of ADAM10 of 69% (Fig. 2, A and B) and 68% (Fig. 3, A and B) in Dharmacon-treated and Ambion siRNA–treated cells, respectively. Following ADAM10 siRNA knockdown, the amount of sPrPC was significantly reduced by 48% (Fig. 2, A and C) and by 30% (Fig. 3, A and C), and the amount of sAPPα was also significantly reduced, by 67% (Fig. 2, A and D) and 85% (Fig. 3, A and D). ADAM10 siRNA caused a 2.2-fold (Fig. 2, E and F) and a 1.3-fold (Fig. 3, E and F) increase in cell surface PrPC relative to nontargeting siRNA as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and the binding of AβO to the cells was increased by 1.7-fold (Fig. 2, E and G) and 1.6-fold (Fig. 3, E and G) in the presence of ADAM10 siRNA relative to nontargeting siRNA. To establish whether this increased binding of AβO was due to the increased cell surface level of PrPC, cells were preincubated with the PrPC antibody, 6D11, which blocks the AβO binding site on PrPC (6Laurán J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M.

Incubation of the cells with the 6D11 antibody had no significant effect on the amount of PrPC at the cell surface (Figs. 2 (E and F) and 3 (E and F)). However, the 6D11 antibody significantly reduced AβΟ binding to the cells by 77% (Fig. 2, E and G) and by 60% (Fig. 3, E and G). In the presence of the 6D11 antibody, siRNA knockdown of ADAM10 failed to increase AβO binding (Figs. 2 (E and G) and 3 (E and G)), indicating that the increased binding of AβO upon ADAM10 knockdown was due to increased cell surface PrPC.Figure 3Knockdown of ADAM10 with an independent siRNA sequence reduces the shedding of PrPC and increases AβO binding.

We propose a beta-binomial model to incorporate time-dependent variance into the assessment of differentially abundant T-cell clones, identified by unique T Cell Receptor (TCR) β-chain rearrangements, and show that this model improves specificity for detecting clinically relevant clonal expansion. Using blood samples from ten healthy donors, we modeled the variance of T-cell clones within each subject over time and calibrated the dispersion parameters of the beta distribution to fit this variance. As a validation, we compared pre- versus post-treatment blood samples from urothelial cancer patients treated with atezolizumab, where clonal expansion (quantified by the earlier binomial model) was previously reported to correlate with benefit. The beta-binomial model significantly reduced the false-positive rate for detecting differentially abundant clones over time compared to the earlier binomial method. In the urothelial cancer cohort, the beta-binomial model enriched for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes among the clones detected as expanding in the peripheral blood in response to therapy compared to the binomial model and improved the overall correlation with clinical benefit. Incorporating time-dependent variance into the statistical framework for measuring differentially abundant T-cell clones improves the model's specificity for T-cells that correlate more strongly with the disease and treatment setting of-interest. Reducing background-level clonal expansion, therefore, improves the quality of clonal expansion as a biomarker for assessing the T cell immune response and correlations with clinical measures."

Because hepatocytes are the primary site for physiological disposal of ammonia, a cytotoxic cellular metabolite generated during a number of metabolic processes, we determined whether hyperammonemia aggravates ethanol-induced muscle loss. Differentiated murine C2C12 myotubes, skeletal muscle from pair-fed or ethanol-treated mice, and human patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and healthy controls were used to quantify protein synthesis, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, and autophagy markers. Alcohol-metabolizing enzyme expression and activity in mouse muscle and myotubes and ureagenesis in hepatocytes were quantified. Expression and regulation of the ammonia transporters, RhBG and RhCG, were quantified by real-time PCR, immunoblots, reporter assays, biotin-tagged promoter pulldown with proteomics, and loss-of-function studies. Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases were expressed and active in myotubes. Ethanol exposure impaired hepatocyte ureagenesis, induced muscle RhBG expression, and elevated muscle ammonia concentrations. Simultaneous ethanol and ammonia treatment impaired protein synthesis and mTORC1 signaling and increased autophagy with a consequent decreased myotube diameter to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Ethanol treatment and withdrawal followed by ammonia exposure resulted in greater impairment in muscle signaling and protein synthesis than ammonia treatment in ethanol-naive myotubes. Of the three transcription factors that were bound to the RhBG promoter in response to ethanol and ammonia, DR1/NC2 indirectly regulated transcription of RhBG during ethanol and ammonia treatment. Direct effects of ethanol were synergistic with increased ammonia uptake in causing dysregulated skeletal muscle proteostasis and signaling perturbations with a more severe sarcopenic phenotype."

Its range is limited to British Columbia where it occurs widely west of the Coast Mountain Ranges extending north almost to the Alaskan Panhandle. The present study focused on surveying within the Cayoosh, Bridge (Shulaps), Seton, Anderson, Carpenter, and Downton Lake drainages. Four years of previous inventory efforts using conventional time-constrained search (TCS) methods detected tailed frog at 23/292 discrete sites (7.9% detection rate) in seven watersheds. Non-invasive environmental DNA (eDNA) methods hold promise for cryptic and low-abundance species detection. We rigorously validated a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based tool for detecting coastal tailed frog eDNA in water samples. This eASTR4 test is highly specific and sensitive. We applied a two-step targeted eDNA analysis approach on duplicate filtered water samples from a total of 72 sites collected over five days. The first IntegritE-DNA step mitigates false negative results and tests all DNA samples for the ability to support amplification from endogenous plant chloroplast DNA as a measure of sample viability. Three DNA samples failed this step even after inhibitor clean up suggesting that these samples were poor quality and not reliable for targeted species’ DNA analyses. All other DNA samples were deemed viable and were then tested for species-specific DNA. Coastal tailed frog eDNA was detected in 55/72 (76%) discrete stream reaches; nine sites with historical known occurrence were all eDNA positive. The false negative rate for TCS compared to eDNA methods was 58%. The results expand known coastal tailed frog distribution to 24 watersheds effectively more than tripling extant occurrences and confirm a previously suspected, apparently isolated coastal tailed frog metapopulation in the Shulaps drainage."

It is now well established that low concentrations of myoglobin are aberrantly expressed in a significant proportion of breast cancer tumors.

Herein, we report a signaling pathway by which myoglobin regulates mitochondrial dynamics and thereby decreases cell proliferation. We demonstrate in vitro that expression of human myoglobin in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF7 breast cancer cells induces mitochondrial hyperfusion by up-regulating mitofusins 1 and 2, the predominant catalysts of mitochondrial fusion. This hyperfusion causes cell cycle arrest and subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation. Mechanistically, increased mitofusin expression was due to myoglobin-dependent free-radical production, leading to the oxidation and degradation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin. We recapitulated this pathway in a murine model in which myoglobin-expressing xenografts exhibited decreased tumor volume with increased mitofusin, markers of cell cycle arrest, and decreased parkin expression. Furthermore, in human triple-negative breast tumor tissues, mitofusin and myoglobin levels were positively correlated. Collectively, these results elucidate a new function for myoglobin as a modulator of mitochondrial dynamics and reveal a novel pathway by which myoglobin decreases breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth by up-regulating mitofusin levels.

https://openalex.org/W2921002143,"Background Despite the increased report of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors, its impact on mosquito’s life-traits after exposure to insecticide-treated nets remains under investigated. Here, we assessed the effects of exposure to PermaNet 2.0 on several life traits of An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus s.l. field mosquitoes in Cameroon. Methodology Female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected indoor using electric aspirators in southern Cameroon (Obout) in 2016. After assessing the resistance status of F1 from the field collected-mosquitoes, progeny of the first generation (An. funestus s.l.) and seventh generation (An. gambiae s.l.) were used to assess the long-term effect of exposure to PermaNet 2.0 on several life-traits of these vectors (longevity, blood feeding ability, fecundity and fertility) in comparison to untreated net. In addition, the L119F-GSTe2 mutation associated with DDT/pyrethroids resistance in An. funestus was genotyped to assess its association with increased life-span post-exposure. Principal findings Both An. funestus and An. gambiae were resistant to pyrethroids and DDT with a greater level in the latter. Pyrethroid-only nets PermaNet 2.0 (17.5% mortality) and Olyset (0% mortality) exhibited a significantly reduced efficacy against An. funestus in contrast to a greater efficacy for PBO-based Nets Olyset Plus (65% mortality), PermaNet 3.0 top (100% mortality). In both species, mosquitoes that survived exposure to PermaNet 2.0 exhibited a significantly reduced longevity than those non-exposed (6.95 days vs 12.46 for An. funestus P<0.001; 8.87 vs 11.25 days for An. gambiae; P<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed for blood feeding and fecundity in both species. In addition, molecular analysis of the L119F-GSTe2 mutation revealed that this mutation is associated with an increase in the chance of surviving after exposure to this net in An. funestus. Conclusions These results show that although the PermaNet 2.0 presents a reduced efficacy against resistant populations, it remains efficient after exposure by reducing the life expectancy of the vectors which could contribute in the reduction of malaria incidence."

Current occupation with governmental and private employee were four and three times more likely to utilize the screening service than those housewife respectively (AOR = 3.85 95%CI: 1.87, 7.92 and AOR = 3.17 95%CI: 1.31, 7.66). Having ever given birth and history of multiple sexual partners were more likely to utilize the screening service (AOR = 2.57 95%CI: 1.02, 6.50) and (AOR = 2.65 95%CI: 1.10, 6.40) respectively. Conclusions There is a need to strengthen policy and guidelines on cervical cancer screening among women particularly with regarding age group of 21–29, current occupation with housewife, single sexual partner and null parity. All stakeholders should give priority on the promotion and initiation of women to acquired good knowledge and attitude on cervical cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W2920992237,"Distribution and abundance of charcoal in coal seams (in form of pyrogenic macerals of the inertinites group) have been considered as a reliable tool to interpret the local and regional palaeo-wildfire regimes in peat-forming depositional environments. Although the occurrence of inertinites is globally well documented for the Late Palaeozoic, the description of palaeobotanical evidence concerning the source plants of such charcoal is so far largely missing. In the present study, we provide the first detailed analysis of macro-charcoal preserved in the Barro Branco coal seam, Rio Bonito Formation, Cisuralian of the Paraná Basin, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Charcoal, in form of macro-charcoal and inertinites, was documented in all the six coal-bearing strata that compose the succession, confirming the occurrence of recurrent palaeo-wildfires during its deposition. Reflectance values indicated a mean charring temperature reaching ~515°C (and up to 1,045°C in excess) and the macro-charcoal exhibits anatomical features of secondary xylem of Agathoxylon. Combination of results derived from palaeobotanical and petrological data demonstrates that gymnosperm-dominated vegetation was repeatedly submitted to fire events and reinforced the hypothesis that Gondwanan mires were high-fire systems during the Cisuralian."
https://openalex.org/W2921111443,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an ocular disease with retinal degeneration. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration is mainly caused by long-term oxidative stress. Kinase activity could be either protective or detrimental to cells during oxidative stress; however, few reports have described the role of kinases in oxidative stress. In this study, high-throughput screening of kinome siRNA library revealed that erb-b2 receptor tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (ERBB2) knockdown reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in ARPE-19 cells during oxidative stress. Silencing ERBB2 caused an elevation in microtubule associated protein light chain C3-II (MAP1LC3B-II/I) conversion and sequesterone (SQSTM)1 protein level. ERBB2 deprivation largely caused an increase in autophagy-regulating protease (ATG4B) expression, a protease that negatively recycles MAP1LC3-II at the fusion step between the autophagosome and lysosome, suggesting ERBB2 might modulate ATG4B for autophagy induction in oxidative stress-stimulated ARPE-19 cells. ERBB2 knockdown also caused an accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and enhanced its transcriptional activity. In addition, ERBB2 ablation or treatment with autophagy inhibitors reduced oxidative-induced cytotoxic effects in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, ERBB2 silencing had little or no additive effects in ATG5/7-deficient cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ERBB2 may play an important role in modulating autophagic RPE cell death during oxidative stress, and ERBB2 may be a potential target in AMD prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2921767705,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent comorbid mental disorder among people with substance use disorders. The MDD can be both primary and substance-induced and its accurate diagnosis represents a challenge for clinical practice and treatment response. Recent studies reported alterations in the circulating expression of inflammatory mediators in patients with psychiatric disorders, including those related to substance use. The aim of the study was to explore TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL12, CCL2, CCL11 (eotaxin-1) and CX3CL1 (fractalkine) as potential biomarkers to identify comorbid MDD and to distinguish primary MDD from substance-induced MDD in patients with substance disorders. Patients diagnosed with cocaine (CUD, n = 64) or alcohol (AUD, n = 65) use disorders with/without MDD were recruited from outpatient treatment programs [CUD/non-MDD (n = 31); CUD/primary MDD (n = 18); CUD/cocaine-induced MDD (N = 15); AUD/non-MDD (n = 27); AUD/primary MDD (n = 16) and AUD/alcohol-induced MDD (n = 22)]. Sixty-two healthy subjects were also recruited as control group. Substance and mental disorders were assessed according to “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision” (DSM-IV-TR) and a blood sample was collected for determinations in the plasma. The cocaine group showed lower TNF-α (p<0.05) and CCL11 (p<0.05), and higher IL-1β (p<0.01) concentrations than the control group. In contrast, the alcohol group showed higher IL-1β (p<0.01) and lower CXCL12 (p<0.01) concentrations than the control group. Regarding MDD, we only observed alterations in the cocaine group. Thus, CUD/MDD patients showed lower IL-1β (p<0.05), CXCL12 (p<0.05) and CCL11 (p<0.05), and higher CXC3CL1 (p<0.05) concentrations than CUD/non-MDD patients. Moreover, while CUD/primary MDD patients showed higher CCL11 (p<0.01) concentrations than both CUD/non-MDD and CUD/cocaine-induced MDD patients, CUD/cocaine-induced MDD patients showed lower CXCL12 (p<0.05) concentrations than CUD/non-MDD patients. Finally, a logistic regression model in the cocaine group identified CXCL12, CCL11 and sex to distinguish primary MDD from cocaine-induced MDD providing a high discriminatory power. The present data suggest an association between changes in inflammatory mediators and the diagnosis of primary and substance-induced MDD, namely in CUD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2922074090,"Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are unique amongst solid tumors in terms of the high cure rates using chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Nevertheless, TGCTs still kill approximately 400 men per year, at a median age of 30 years, in the United States. This young age of mortality dramatically amplifies the impact of these deaths for the patients and their often young families. Furthermore the high cure rate makes it difficult to conduct further clinical trials of non curable disease. TGCTs are characterized by a marked aneuploidy and the presence of gain of chromosomal region 12p. Genomic testing may offer the ability to identify potentially lethal TGCTs at the time of initial diagnosis. However sequencing based studies have shown a paucity of somatic mutations in TGCT genomes including those that drive refractory disease. Furthermore these studies may be limited by genetic heterogeneity in primary tumors and the evolution of sub populations during disease progression. Herein we applied a systematic approach combining DNA content flow cytometry, whole genome copy number and whole exome sequence analyses to interrogate tumor heterogeneity in primary and metastatic refractory TGCTs. We identified both known and novel somatic copy number aberrations (12p, MDM2, and RHBDD1) and mutations (XRCC2, PIK3CA, RITA1) including candidate markers for platinum resistance that were present in a primary tumor of mixed histology and that remained after tandem autologous stem cell transplant."
https://openalex.org/W2894750263,"Differences in the timing of exoskeleton melanization and sclerotization are evident when comparing eusocial and solitary bees. This cuticular maturation heterochrony may be associated with life style, considering that eusocial bees remain protected inside the nest for many days after emergence, while the solitary bees immediately start outside activities. To address this issue, we characterized gene expression using large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and quantified cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparative studies of the integument (cuticle plus its underlying epidermis) of two eusocial and a solitary bee species. In addition, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for studying the developing cuticle of these and other three bee species also differing in life style. We found 13,200, 55,209 and 30,161 transcript types in the integument of the eusocial Apis mellifera and Frieseomelitta varia, and the solitary Centris analis, respectively. In general, structural cuticle proteins and chitin-related genes were upregulated in pharate-adults and newly-emerged bees whereas transcripts for odorant binding proteins, cytochrome P450 and antioxidant proteins were overrepresented in foragers. Consistent with our hypothesis, a distance correlation analysis based on the differentially expressed genes suggested delayed cuticle maturation in A. mellifera in comparison to the solitary bee. However, this was not confirmed in the comparison with F. varia. The expression profiles of 27 of 119 genes displaying functional attributes related to cuticle formation/differentiation were positively correlated between A. mellifera and F. varia, and negatively or non-correlated with C. analis, suggesting roles in cuticular maturation heterochrony. However, we also found transcript profiles positively correlated between each one of the eusocial species and C. analis. Gene co-expression networks greatly differed between the bee species, but we identified common gene interactions exclusively between the eusocial species. Except for F. varia, the TEM analysis is consistent with cuticle development timing adapted to the social or solitary life style. In support to our hypothesis, the absolute quantities of n-alkanes and unsaturated CHCs were significantly higher in foragers than in the earlier developmental phases of the eusocial bees, but did not discriminate newly-emerged from foragers in C. analis. By highlighting differences in integument gene expression, cuticle ultrastructure, and CHC profiles between eusocial and solitary bees, our data provided insights into the process of heterochronic cuticle maturation associated to the way of life."
https://openalex.org/W2921160382,"Cerament (Bonesupport Holding, Lund, Sweden) is a bioresorbable synthetic bone substitute consisting of calcium sulfate and hydroxyapatite which is successfully used as a bone graft in bone defects or in delayed and non-unions after fractures. Besides, calcium sulfate/ hydroxyapatite (CAS/HA) could have, attributed to its composition and osteoinductive properties, have great importance in the treatment of bone infections with critical size defects (CSD). Aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of antibiotic infused CAS/HA on inflammation and bone healing in an implant-associated osteitis mice model. In a standardized murine model, the left femur of 72 BALB/c mice were osteotomized, generating a CSD (2,5 mm) with stabilization through a 6-hole titanium locking plate. Osteitis has been induced through inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) into the fracture gap. To analyze the effect of CAS/HA, following groups were generated with either CAS/HA, CAS/HA with gentamycin (CAS/ HA-G) or CAS/HA with vancomycin (CAS/HA-V) insets placed into the osteotomy. Debridément and lavages were progressed on day 7 and 42 to determine the local bacterial growth and the immune reaction. Fracture healing was quantified on day 7 and 42 by x-ray and bone healing markers from blood samples. Progression of infection was assessed by estimation of colony-forming units (CFU) and immune response was analyzed by determination of Interleukin (IL)- 6 and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in lavage samples. Osteitis induced higher IL-6 and PMN-levels in the lavage samples on day 7. Both parameters showed a reduction in all groups on day 42. CAS/HA-V revealed a significant reduction of CFU and PMNs in lavage samples on day 42. A positive effect on bone healing could only be shown in non-infected mice. Whereas, application of mere CAS/HA in infected mice did show tendencies of bone destruction and lysis, independent of impregnation with antibiotics or not. Thus, application of CAS/HA in acute implant-associated infections is not recommended. In non-infectious environments or after infect-convalescence CAS/HA could albeit serve as a suggestive tool in trauma and orthopedic surgery."

An experimental data set for human in vitro AhR activation comprising 324,858 substances, of which 1,982 were confirmed actives, was used to test an in-house-developed approach to rationally select Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) training set substances from an unbalanced data set. In the first iteration, active and inactive substances were selected by random to make QSAR models. Then, more inactive substances were added to the training set in two further iterations based on incorrect or out-of-domain predictions to produce larger models. The resulting ‘rational’ model, comprising 832 actives and four times as many inactives, i.e. 3,328, was compared to a model with a training set of same size and proportion of inactives chosen entirely by random. Both models underwent robust cross-validation and external validation showing good statistical performance, with the rational model having external validation sensitivity of 85.1% and specificity of 97.1%, compared to the random model with sensitivity 89.1% and specificity 91.3%. Furthermore, we integrated the training sets for both models with the 93 external validation test set actives and 372 randomly selected inactives to make two final models. They also underwent external validations for specificity and cross-validations, which confirmed that good predictivity was maintained. All developed models were applied to predict 80,086 EU REACH substances. The rational and random final models had 63.1% and 56.9% coverage of the REACH set, respectively, and predicted 1,256 and 3,214 substances as actives. The final models as well as predictions for AhR activation for 650,000 substances will be published in the Danish (Q)SAR Database and can, for example, be used for priority setting, in read-across predictions and in weight-of-evidence assessments of chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2920938170,"Background Platelet count is known to be associated with sex, age and mean platelet volume (MPV). Sex and age were proposed for adjustment of platelet count reference intervals, but MPV is currently not used for further adjustment. We investigated the association of MPV, age and sex with platelet counts and established individualized reference ranges respecting MPV. Methods The association of platelet count with age, sex and MPV was assessed in healthy participants (n = 3,033 individuals; 1,542 women) in the cross-sectional population-based cohort Study of Health in Pomerania. Reference intervals respecting age, sex, and MPV were estimated using quantile regressions for the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile. Results Women had higher platelet counts than men (239 vs. 207 x109/L, p<0.001). Platelet counts correlated with age (p<0.001) and MPV (p<0.001). Quantile regression of lower and upper platelet count limits correlated less with age in female (p = 0.047 for 2.5th percentile; p = 0.906 for 97.5th percentile) and male subjects (p = 0.029 for 2.5th percentile; p = 0.195 for 97.5th percentile) compared to MPV (p<0.001 for upper and lower limit for both sexes). After adjustment for MPV, age did no longer correlate with the 2.5th (p = 0.165) or 97.5th percentile (p = 0.999) of platelet count. In contrast, after adjustment for age, MPV levels still significantly correlated with 2.5th, 50th and 97.5th percentile (p<0.001). Conclusion MPV and sex have a stronger association with platelet count than age. MPV should be considered to adjust platelet count reference intervals and needs to be respected as confounder for platelet counts in epidemiological studies and clinical practice."

In this study, an ultra-performance hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (UPHILIC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of allopurinol, oxypurinol and lesinurad in rat plasma. Liquid liquid extraction using ethyl acetate as extracting agent was used for samples extraction procedure. Acquity UPLC HILIC column (100 mm x 2.1, 1.7μm) was used for separation of allopurinol, oxypurinol, lesinurad and internal standard (5-Florouracil). The mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, water and formic acid (95:5:0.1, v/v/v), were eluted at 0.3 mL/min flow rate having total chromatographic run time of 3 min per sample. The analytes were detected on Acquity triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-Spray electrospray ionization (ESI). The ESI source was operated in negative mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for ion transition for all compounds. The precursor to product ion transition of m/z 134.94 > 64.07 for allopurinol, 150.89 > 41.91 for oxypurinol, 401.90 > 176.79 for lesinurad and 128.85 >41.92 for internal standard were used for identification and quantification.

https://openalex.org/W2921906253,"Background The use of robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) is becoming increasingly prevalent across a range of surgical specialties within public hospitals around Australia. As a result, it is critical that organisations consider workplace factors such as staff knowledge, attitudes and behaviours prior to the implementation of such new technology. This study aimed to describe the knowledge and attitudes of operating theatre staff from a large public tertiary referral hospital prior to the commencement of an RAS program. Methods A cross-sectional survey of nursing, medical and support staff working in the operating theatre complex of a large public tertiary referral hospital was completed over a one-week period in June 2016. A 23-item questionnaire was utilised for data collection. Results 164 (66%) theatre staff returned the surveys and were included in this study. The majority of medical staff reported being knowledgeable about RAS, whilst the majority of nursing and support staff did not. Overall the theatre staff were neutral about the potential benefits of RAS to patients. The majority of medical staff believed the implementation of RAS will increase the value of staff roles and job satisfaction, while nursing and support staff were uncertain about these benefits. All three staff groups were concerned about the impact of an RAS program on Workplace Health and Safety, and care and handling. Conclusion Operating theatre staff presented different knowledge and attitudes prior to the introduction of RAS. Whilst theatre staff were more favourable towards RAS than negative, they largely reserved their judgement about the new system prior to their own experiences. Collectively, these findings should be taken into consideration for training and support strategies prior to the implementation of a RAS program."

The aim of this analysis was to assess individual-level determinants and the role of country of residence and specifically a country`s public institutional long-term care infrastructure on proxy-reported NHA in the last year of life.We analysed data from 7,018 deceased respondents (65+) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004-2015, 16 countries) using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression analysis in order to model proxy-reported NHA.In total, 14% of the general older population utilised nursing home care in the last year of life but there was substantial variation across countries (range = 2-30%). On the individual-level, need factors such as functional and cognitive impairment were the strongest predictors of NHA. In total, 18% of the variance of NHA was located at the country-level; public expenditure on institutional care strongly affected the chance of NHA in the last year of life.On the individual-level, the strong impact of need factors indicated equitable access to NHA, whereas differences in public spending for institutional care indicated inequitable access across European countries."
https://openalex.org/W2921605177,"We present a system-level analysis of proteome, phosphoproteome, and chromatin state of precursors of muscle cells (myoblasts) differentiating into specialized myotubes. Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture and nano-liqud chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, we found that phosphorylation motifs targeted by the kinases protein kinase C, cyclin-dependent kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase showed increased phosphorylation during myodifferentiation of LHCN-M2 human skeletal myoblast cell line. Drugs known to inhibit these kinases either promoted (PD0325901 and GW8510) or stalled (CHIR99021 and roscovitine) differentiation, resulting in myotube and myoblast phenotypes, respectively. The proteomes, especially the myogenic and chromatin-related proteins including histone methyltransferases, correlated with their phenotypes, leading us to quantify histone post-translational modifications and identify two gene-silencing marks, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, with relative abundances changing in correlation with these phenotypes. ChIP–quantitative PCR demonstrated that H3K9me3 is erased from the gene loci of myogenic regulatory factors namely MYOD1, MYOG, and MYF5 in differentiating myotubes. Together, our work integrating histone post-translational modification, phosphoproteomics, and full proteome analysis gives a comprehensive understanding of the close connection between signaling pathways and epigenetics during myodifferentiation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2920981555,"The evolutionarily conserved Escherichia coli translesion DNA polymerase IV (DinB) is one of three enzymes that can bypass potentially deadly DNA lesions on the template strand during DNA replication. Remarkably, however, DinB is the only known translesion DNA polymerase active in RecA-mediated strand exchange during error-prone double-strand break repair. In this process, a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-RecA nucleoprotein filament invades homologous dsDNA, pairing the ssDNA with the complementary strand in the dsDNA. When exchange reaches the 3' end of the ssDNA, a DNA polymerase can add nucleotides onto the end, using one strand of dsDNA as a template and displacing the other. It is unknown what makes DinB uniquely capable of participating in this reaction. To explore this topic, we performed molecular modeling of DinB's interactions with the RecA filament during strand exchange, identifying key contacts made with residues in the DinB fingers domain. These residues are highly conserved in DinB, but not in other translesion DNA polymerases. Using a novel FRET-based assay, we found that DinB variants with mutations in these conserved residues are less effective at stabilizing RecA-mediated strand exchange than native DinB. Furthermore, these variants are specifically deficient in strand displacement in the absence of RecA filament. We propose that the amino acid patch of highly conserved residues in DinB-like proteins provides a mechanistic explanation for DinB's function in strand exchange and improves our understanding of recombination by providing evidence that RecA plays a role in facilitating DinB's activity during strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2921609211,"We evaluated whether chronic administration of LIMK2-inhibitors could improve erectile function by alleviating CVOD through suppressing cavernosal fibrosis in a rat model of cavernosal nerve crush-injury (CNCI). Forty-two 12-week-old rats were equally categorized into the three groups: sham-surgery (S), CNCI (I), and CNCI treated with LIMK2-inhibitors (L). The L-group was treated with daily intraperitoneal injection of LIMK2-inhibitors (10.0 mg/kg) for 30-days after surgery. Erectile function was assessed using dynamic-infusion-cavernosometry (DIC). Penile tissue was processed for Masson's-trichrome staining, Western-blotting, and double immunofluorescence. The I-group showed significantly higher maintenance and drop rates as well as lower papaverine response, compared to the S-group. Chronic inhibition of LIMK2 in the L-group significantly improved the DIC parameters compared to those in the I-group, although the parameters were not completely restored to normal control values. Also, the I-group showed a reduced smooth muscle (SM)-to-collagen ratio, decreased immunohistochemical staining for α-SM-actin, increased number of fibroblasts positive for phosphorylated Cofilin, increased LIMK2/Cofilin phosphorylation and increased protein expression of Collagen-1 or Fibronectin, compared to the S-group. The L-group showed significant improvements in SM/collagen ratio and the deposition of Collagen-1 or Fibronectin compared to the I-group, although not completely normalized. According to the densitometry and confocal microscopy results, the L-group showed restoration of LIMK2/Cofilin phosphorylation and amount of fibroblasts positive for phosphorylated Cofilin to the normal control value. In conclusion, chronic inhibition of LIMK2 can improve CVOD and ED by alleviating cavernosal fibrosis via normalizing the LIMK2/Cofilin pathway."

However, the genetic gains for economically important traits can be influenced by the accuracy of genomic predictions. The objective of this study was to investigate the prediction accuracies of traditional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), multi-step genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) methods in American mink using simulated data with different levels of heritability, marker density, training set (TS) sizes and selection designs based on either phenotypic performance or estimated breeding values (EBVs). Under EBV selection design, the accuracy of BLUP predictions was increased by 38% and 44% for h2 = 0.10, 27% and 29% for h2 = 0.20, and 5.8% and 6% for h2 = 0.50 using GBLUP and ssGBLUP methods, respectively. Under phenotypic selection design, the accuracies of prediction by ssGBLUP method were 11.8% and 15.4% higher than those obtained by GBLUP for heritability of 0.10 and 0.20, respectively. However, the efficiency of ssGBLUP and GBLUP was not influenced by selection design at higher level of heritability (h2 = 0.50). Furthermore, higher selection intensity increased the bias of predictions in both pedigree-based and genomic evaluations. Regardless of selection design, TS sizes for GBLUP and ssGBLUP methods should be at least 3000 to achieve more accuracy than using BLUP for heritability of 0.50 and marker density of 10k and 50k. Overall, more accurate predictions were obtained using ssGBLUP method particularly for lowly heritable traits and low density of markers. Our results indicated that TS sizes should be optimized in accordance with heritability level, marker density, selection design and prediction method for genomic selection in American mink. The results provided an initial framework for designing genomic selection in mink breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2921536524,"Background Influenza-like Illness (ILI) is a medical diagnosis of possible influenza or another respiratory illness with a common set of symptoms. The deaths of four schoolchildren, during a pandemic influenza outbreak in December 2017 in Ghana, raised doubts about the ILI surveillance system’s performance. We evaluated the ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region, Ghana, to assess the system’s attributes and its performance on set objectives. Methods CDC guidelines were used to evaluate the data of the ILI surveillance system between 2013 and 2017. We interviewed the surveillance personnel on the system’s description and operation. Additionally, routinely entered ILI data from the National Influenza Center provided by the six sentinel sites in Accra was extracted. We sampled and reviewed 120 ILI case-investigation forms from these sites. Surveillance activities were examined on system’s performance indicators, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 3 (poorest to best performance). Results All population and age groups were under ILI surveillance over the period evaluated. Overall, 2948 suspected case-patients, including 392 (13.3%) children under-five were reported, with 219 being positive for influenza virus (Predictive value positive = 7.4%). The predominant influenza subtype was H3N2, recorded in 90 (41.1%) of positive case-patients. The system only met two out of its four objectives. None of the six sentinel sites consistently met their annual 260 suspected case-detection quota. Samples reached the laboratory on average 48 hours after collection and results were disseminated within 7 days. Of 120 case-investigation forms sampled, 91 (76.3%) were completely filled in. Conclusions The ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region is only partially meeting its objectives. While it is found to be sensitive, representative and timely, the data quality was sub-optimal. We recommend the determination of thresholds for alert and outbreak detection and ensuring that sentinel sites meet their weekly case-detection targets."
https://openalex.org/W2922141497,"Change in the nutritional quality of phytoplankton is a key mechanism through which ocean acidification can affect the function of marine ecosystems. Copepods play an important role transferring energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels, including fatty acids (FA)—essential macronutrients synthesized by primary producers that can limit zooplankton and fisheries production. We investigated the direct effects of pCO2 on phytoplankton and copepods in the laboratory, as well as the trophic transfer of effects of pCO2 on food quality. The marine cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina was cultured at 400, 800, and 1200 μatm pCO2 and fed to adult Acartia hudsonica acclimated to the same pCO2 levels. We examined changes in phytoplankton growth rate, cell size, carbon content, and FA content, and copepod FA content, grazing, respiration, egg production, hatching, and naupliar development. This single-factor experiment was repeated at 12°C and at 17°C. At 17°C, the FA content of R. salina responded non-linearly to elevated pCO2 with the greatest FA content at intermediate levels, which was mirrored in A. hudsonica; however, differences in ingestion rate indicate that copepods accumulated FA less efficiently at elevated pCO2. A. hudsonica nauplii developed faster at elevated pCO2 at 12°C in the absence of strong food quality effects, but not at 17°C when food quality varied among treatments. Our results demonstrate that changes to the nutritional quality of phytoplankton are not directly translated to their grazers, and that studies that include trophic links are key to unraveling how ocean acidification will drive changes in marine food webs."

Attentional set-shifting has traditionally been measured with the Dimensional Change Card Sort, however, this task requires following verbal instructions. Here, we used a novel visual search task that does not require verbal instructions in conjunction with eye-tracking to test attentional set-shifting in 2-year-old toddlers diagnosed with ASD (N = 29) and chronological age-matched typically developing controls (N = 30). On each trial, a relevant and an irrelevant target were embedded in a set of feature-conjunction distractors, and toddlers were tasked with searching for the relevant target. Critically, after a set of trials the targets switched roles (i.e., the previously relevant target became irrelevant, and the previously relevant target became irrelevant). We measured visual search performance prior to and following a target switch. We found that both groups of toddlers could readily switch targets, and found strikingly similar performance between typically developing toddlers and toddlers with ASD. Our results challenge the centrality of deficits in attentional set-shifting to early behavioral inflexibility in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2921182898,"Introduction The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is expressed in normal lungs and is upregulated during infection. AGEs and RAGE cause oxidative stress and apoptosis in lung cells. The objective of this study is to evaluate levels of AGEs and its soluble receptor (sRAGE), and to investigate their relationship with food intake and nutritional status, in a university-affiliated hospital in Brazil. Methods Case-control study, from June 2017 to June 2018. AGE (carboxymethyl lysine, CML) and sRAGE were measured from blood samples by Elisa. Nutritional assessment was performed by body mass index, triceps skin-fold thickness, mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and food frequency questionnaire. Results We included in the study 35 tuberculosis (TB) patients and 35 controls. The mean sRAGE levels were higher in TB patients than in controls (68.5 ± 28.1 vs 57.5 ± 24.0 pg/mL; p = 0.046). Among cases that were current smokers, lower sRAGE levels were associated with mortality, evaluated at the end of hospitalization (p = 0.006), and with weight loss (p = 0.034). There was no statistically significant difference in CML levels and diet CML content between cases and controls. Malnutrition was more frequent in cases, but there was no correlation between nutritional parameters and CML or sRAGE levels. Conclusions TB patients had higher sRAGE levels than controls, although it is not clear that this difference is clinically relevant. Also, sRAGE was associated with weight loss and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2922249769,"The vehicle-pedestrian encounter at midblock crosswalks in urban centers is inevitable but the challenge to urban transportation planners is in achieving a balance between traffic flow efficiency and pedestrian safety. Vehicles are expected to yield to pedestrians who have a right of way at the midblock unsignalized crosswalks but, failure to yield causes conflicts that at times are fatal. This study investigated the effect of macroscopic factors on the vehicle yielding. Six environmental factors are considered: temporal gap size, number of traffic lanes, number of waiting pedestrians, position of pedestrian (whether on street kerb or median), traffic flow direction and presence (or absence) of monitoring ePolice. Video Data on six observed variables that influenced vehicle yielding was collected from 13 uncontrolled crosswalk locations in Shanghai city in the Peoples Republic of China. A Logit model with a 95.9% accuracy was developed to describe the vehicle yielding behavior. The results showed that gap size and number of traffic lanes had the highest influence on driver yielding decision and that drivers were more likely to yield if ePolice was present. The sensitivity analysis was conducted and appropriate recommendations on improving the pedestrians crossing safety were proposed accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2922062342,"Toxocariasis is a zoonotic disease that affects humans and animals alike. Although recombinant proteins are widely used for its diagnosis in humans, their performance in companion and production animals remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the serodiagnostic potential of the recombinant proteins rTES-30 and rTES-120 from Toxocara canis in an indirect ELISA for cattle, horses, and sheep. Serum samples collected from the animals were tested with indirect ELISA and Western Blotting using T. canis TES-30 and TES-120 recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli, as well as native-TES. In the ELISA, rTES-30 showed high serodiagnostic potential in sheep and horses (92.6% and 85.2%, respectively), while the sensitivity of rTES-120 was higher in cattle and horses (97.2% and 92.6%, respectively). Furthermore, a highly positive association was observed between native and recombinant proteins in seropositive samples, while a moderately positive association was observed in seronegative samples, probably due to the lower specificity of native TES. In conclusion, our study indicates that the use of recombinant proteins in an indirect ELISA is an effective tool for the serodiagnosis of toxocariasis in animals, with the choice of protein being species-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2920863246,"Urinary Calprotectin, a mediator of the innate immune system, has been identified as a biomarker in bladder cancer. Our aim was to investigate the association between sterile leukocyturia and urinary Calprotectin in low-grade and high-grade bladder cancer.We performed a prospective cross-sectional study including 52 patients with bladder cancer and 40 healthy controls. Definition of sterile leukocyturia was > 5.0 leukocytes per visual field in absence of bacteriuria.The rate of sterile leukocyturia in low-grade (60.0%) and high-grade (62.0%) bladder cancer was comparable (p = 0.87). However, the median absolute urinary leukocyte count in patients with sterile leukocyturia was significantly higher in high-grade than in low-grade bladder cancer (p < 0.01). Spearman correlation revealed a significant correlation between urinary Calprotectin and leucocyte concentration (R = 0.4, p < 0.001). Median urinary Calprotectin concentration was 4.5 times higher in bladder cancer patients with than in patients without sterile leukocyturia (p = 0.03). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference in urinary Calprotectin regarding the presence of sterile leukocyturia in high-grade patients (596.8 [91.8-1655.5] vs. 90.4 [28.0-202.3] ng ml-1, p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis identified the leukocyte concentration to be the only significant impact factor for urinary Calprotectin (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.5-3.8, p = 0.001). Immunohistochemistry showed Calprotectin positive neutrophils and tumour cells in high-grade bladder cancer with sterile leukocyturia.Urinary Calprotectin cannot be regarded as a specific tumour marker for bladder cancer, but rather as a surrogate parameter for tumour inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2922049617,"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are concerning adverse events resulting from cancer treatment, and current guidelines recommend the use of neurokinin-1-selective antagonists, such as fosaprepitant, in highly emetogenic schemes. However, the implementation of this strategy may be limited by the cost of treatment. GSTP1 c.313A>G genotype was recently described as a predictor of vomiting related to high-dose cisplatin. We hypothesized that the inclusion of routine GSTP1 c.313A>G screening may be promising in financial terms, in contrast to the wide-spread use of fosaprepitant.A cost-minimization analysis was planned to compare GSTP1 c.313A>G genotyping versus overall fosaprepitant implementation for patients with head and neck cancer under chemoradiation therapy with high-dose cisplatin. A decision analytic tree was designed, and conditional probabilities were calculated under Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The observed data included patients under treatment without fosaprepitant, while priors were derived from published studies.To introduce screening with real-time polymerase chain reaction, an initial investment of U$ 39,379.97 would be required, with an amortization cost of U$ 7,272.97 per year. The mean cost of standard therapy with fosaprepitant is U$ 243.24 per patient, and although the initial cost of routine genotyping is higher, there is a tendency of progressive minimization at a threshold of 155 patients (Credible interval-CI: 119 to 216), provided more than one sample is incorporated for simultaneous analysis. A resulting reduction of 35.83% (CI: 30.31 to 41.74%) in fosaprepitant expenditures is then expected with the implementation of GSTP1 c.313A>G genotyping.GSTP1 c.313A>G genotyping may reduce the use of preventive support for chemotherapy induced nausea and lower the overall cost of treatment. Despite the results of this simulation, randomized, interventional studies are required to control for known and unknown confounders as well as unexpected expenses."
https://openalex.org/W2920811679,"Image magnification often results in disorientation through loss of orientation and location during inspection. This study investigated the effects of three different magnification modes viz. full screen, circular, and fixed-area on visual inspection performance. Also, to improve participants' global orientation with respect to the original product, location cues in the form of halftone landmarks were introduced as a job aid and their effectiveness on inspection performance was examined. Twenty-eight undergraduates participated in the experiment. Significant magnification mode effect was found, but the location cue effect was found non-significant. The results suggested that the presentation of content/contextual information on one single screen should be considered together with the nature of the visual task and participants' search behaviors, and that the aid of location cues might be useful when the visual task demanded a high level of search memory and/or an unsystematic search strategy was employed by inspectors."
https://openalex.org/W2920819008,"Larval swimming with cilia, unaided by muscles, is the presumed ancestral condition for echinoderms, but use of muscles in swimming has evolved several times. Ciliation and musculature of the arms of brachiolaria-stage larvae in the family Asteriidae provide unusual versatility in the use of muscles in swimming. The muscles affect swimming in two different ways. (1) Contraction of muscles moves the arms, propelling the larva. (2) Contraction of muscles changes orientation of the arms, thereby changing direction of ciliary currents and direction of swimming. New observations of the brachiolaria of the asteriid seastar Pisaster ochraceus demonstrate more versatility in both of these uses of muscles than had been previously described: the posterolateral arms stroke in more ways to propel the larva forward and to change the direction of swimming, and more pairs of the arms point ciliary currents in more directions for changes in direction of swimming. Morphology of brachiolariae suggests that these uses of muscles in swimming evolved before divergence of the families Stichasteridae and Asteriidae within forcipulate asteroids. This versatile use of muscles for swimming, both alone and in combination with ciliary currents, further distinguishes the swimming of these brachiolariae from swimming by larvae of other echinoderms and larvae of acorn worms in the sister phylum Hemichordata."
https://openalex.org/W2921567156,"Pangolins face a bleak future as the world9s most poached and trafficked animals. They are in demand for both their meat and their scales, believed in some Asian countries to have medicinal properties. All eight species—four living in Africa and four in Asia—are threatened with extinction, and the past 2 months have seen record-setting seizures of pangolin body parts. Several groups and government agencies are now intensifying conservation efforts, but it9s an uphill battle. Pangolins are small, shy, and believed to be mostly nocturnal, so they don9t attract tourist dollars, as large wildlife does. Patchy understanding of their population size, breeding behavior, migratory patterns, and physiology also hampers conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2920906764,"The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is the newest radio telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in western Canada. The telescope is small and cheap compared with other leading radio observatories. But by luck as much as design, its capabilities are just right for probing what may be the most compelling new mystery in astronomy: signals from the distant universe called fast radio bursts (FRBs). First discovered in 2007, FRBs are so bright that they stick out in the data like a peak in the nearby Canadian Rockies—providing a telescope is watching and its electronics are fast enough to pick out the pulses, which last only a few thousandths of a second. In January, CHIME made global headlines for bagging 13 new FRBs, bringing the total known to more than 60. Scientists think CHIME could end up finding as many as two dozen FRBs a day."
