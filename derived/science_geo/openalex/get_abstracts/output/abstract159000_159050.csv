https://openalex.org/W2064893459,"Seismic tomography models of the three-dimensional upper mantle velocity structure of the Mediterranean-Carpathian region provide a better understanding of the lithospheric processes governing its geodynamical evolution. Slab detachment, in particular lateral migration of this process along the plate boundary, is a key element in the lithospheric dynamics of the region during the last 20 to 30 million years. It strongly affects arc and trench migration, and causes along-strike variations in vertical motions, stress fields, and magmatism. In a terminal-stage subduction zone, involving collision and suturing, slab detachment is the natural last stage in the gravitational settling of subducted lithosphere."

We report the identification of multiple independent adaptive mutations that cluster in the HCV nonstructural protein NS5A and confer increased replicative ability in vitro. Among these adaptive mutations were a single amino acid substitution that allowed HCV RNA replication in 10% of transfected hepatoma cells and a deletion of 47 amino acids encompassing the interferon (IFN) sensitivity determining region (ISDR). Independent of the ISDR, IFN-alpha rapidly inhibited HCV RNA replication in vitro. This work establishes a robust, cell-based system for genetic and functional analyses of HCV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2094173026,"Sedimentary time series of color reflectance and major element chemistry from the anoxic Cariaco Basin off the coast of northern Venezuela record large and abrupt shifts in the hydrologic cycle of the tropical Atlantic during the past 90,000 years. Marine productivity maxima and increased precipitation and riverine discharge from northern South America are closely linked to interstadial (warm) climate events of marine isotope stage 3, as recorded in Greenland ice cores. Increased precipitation at this latitude during interstadials suggests the potential for greater moisture export from the Atlantic to Pacific, which could have affected the salinity balance of the Atlantic and increased thermohaline heat transport to high northern latitudes. This supports the notion that tropical feedbacks played an important role in modulating global climate during the last glacial period."
https://openalex.org/W1983027048,"Layered and massive outcrops on Mars, some as thick as 4 kilometers, display the geomorphic attributes and stratigraphic relations of sedimentary rock. Repeated beds in some locations imply a dynamic depositional environment during early martian history. Subaerial (such as eolian, impact, and volcaniclastic) and subaqueous processes may have contributed to the formation of the layers. Affinity for impact craters suggests dominance of lacustrine deposition; alternatively, the materials were deposited in a dry, subaerial setting in which atmospheric density, and variations thereof mimic a subaqueous depositional environment. The source regions and transport paths for the materials are not preserved."
https://openalex.org/W2120555366,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces adhesion molecules on endothelial cells during inflammation. Here we examined the mechanisms underlying VEGF-stimulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. VEGF (20 ng/ml) increased expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNAs in a time-dependent manner. These effects were significantly suppressed by Flk-1/kinase-insert domain containing receptor (KDR) antagonist and by inhibitors of phospholipase C, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, sphingosine kinase, and protein kinase C, but they were not affected by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 or nitric-oxide synthase. Unexpectedly, the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase inhibitor wortmannin enhanced both basal and VEGF-stimulated adhesion molecule expression, whereas insulin, a PI 3′-kinase activator, suppressed both basal and VEGF-stimulated expression. Gel shift analysis revealed that VEGF stimulated NF-κB activity. This effect was inhibited by phospholipase C, NF-κB, or protein kinase C inhibitor. VEGF increased VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein levels and increased leukocyte adhesiveness in a NF-κB-dependent manner. These results suggest that VEGF-stimulated expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNAs was mainly through NF-κB activation with PI 3′-kinase-mediated suppression, but was independent of nitric oxide and MEK. Thus, VEGF simultaneously activates two signal transduction pathways that have opposite functions in the induction of adhesion molecule expression. The existence of parallel inverse signaling implies that the induction of adhesion molecule expression by VEGF is very finely regulated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces adhesion molecules on endothelial cells during inflammation.

In health, the luminal endothelial cell surface is a relatively nonadhesive and nonthrombogenic conduit for the cellular and macromolecular constituents of the blood. The extracellular matrix holds the basal endothelial cell surface in a well arranged array. In certain diseases, various adhesive interactions between endothelial cells and the constituents of the blood or extracellular matrix are changed. These diseases include inflammation, atherosclerosis, pathologic angiogenesis, and vascular injury. During these disease processes, adhesion molecules are closely involved (1Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Haber E. Molecular Cardiovascular Medicine. Scientific American Medicine, New York1995: 49-61Google Scholar,2Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Nagel T. Topper J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S61-S65PubMed Google Scholar). To date, four families of cell adhesion molecules have been described: integrins, immunoglobulin superfamily members, cadherins, and selectins. Members of each family have been detected in blood vessels during angiogenesis and inflammation (3Bischoff J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S37-S39PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 is a potent angiogenic factor whose activities include endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, and tube formation (4Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). VEGF also acts as a proinflammatory cytokine by increasing endothelial permeability and inducing adhesion molecules that bind leukocytes to endothelial cells (5Melder R.J. Koenig G.C. Witwer B.P.

In this study, we examined signal transduction mechanisms by which VEGF induces adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We demonstrate that VEGF-stimulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin mRNAs is mediated mainly through nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase-mediated suppression but is independent of NO and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK). Recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor165 (VEGF165), placenta growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were purchased from R&D Systems. Flk-1/kinase-insert domain containing receptor (KDR) antagonist SU1498, nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and its inactive isomer,N G-nitro-d-arginine methyl ester (d-NAME) were purchased from Calbiochem. PI 3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were purchased from RBI, Inc. MEK 1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was obtained from New England Biolabs. PLC inhibitor U73122 was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratory Inc. Sphingosine kinase inhibitorN,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine chloride were purchased from Sigma. Media and sera were obtained from Life Technology, Inc. Functional blocking antibodies for ICAM-1 (clone P2A4), VCAM-1 (clone P3C4), and E-selectin (clone P2H3) were purchased from Chemicon, Inc. Most other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. HUVECs were prepared from human umbilical cords by collagenase digestion and maintained as described previously (18Kim I. Moon S.O. Koh K.N. Kim H. Uhm C.S. Kwak H.J. Kim N.G. Koh G.Y. J. Biol.

The partial cDNAs of human ICAM-1 (nucleotides 859–1225, GenBank accession NM_000201), human VCAM-1 (nucleotides 538–816, GenBank accession M60335), and human E-selectin (nucleotides 783–989, GenBank accession M30640) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). After linearizing withEcoRI, 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase (Ambion Maxiscript kit) and gel purified. RPA was performed on total RNAs using the Ambion RPA kit. An antisense RNA probe of human cyclophilin (nucleotides 135–239, GenBank accession X52856) was used as an internal control for RNA quantification. HUVECs were incubated with the indicated agents for the indicated times and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear proteins were extracted as follows. The cells were scraped into buffer A (10 mmol/liter HEPES, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter KCl) and centrifuged briefly. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer B (20 mmol/liter HEPES, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.42 mol/liter NaCl, 0.2 mmol/liter EDTA, 25% glycerol, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant, which contains the nuclear proteins, was diluted with buffer C (20 mmol/liter HEPES, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 0.2 mmol/liter EDTA, 20% glycerol, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin). The protein concentrations were measured using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). The binding reaction was a 30-min incubation of 10 μg of nuclear protein with a 32P end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB binding site on the human VCAM-1 promoter (5′-CCTTGAAGGGATTTCCCTCC-3′) (19Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cold competition controls were performed by preincubating the nuclear proteins with unlabeled 20-fold molar excess of the NF-κB double-stranded oligonucleotide for 20 min before the addition of the32P-labeled oligonucleotide. As a negative control, a cold competition was also performed with an irrelevant octamer transcription factor (Oct)-1 oligonucleotide (5′-TAGAGGATCCATGCAAATGCCGGGTACC-3′). In antibody supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 μg of polyclonal rabbit antibodies to human NF-κB proteins (p65, p50, p52, RelB, and c-Rel; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with labeled oligonucleotide. The mixtures were resolved on native 5% polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and autoradiographed. For Western blot analysis, samples were mixed with sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation in blocking buffer, incubated with anti-VCAM-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Signals were visualized by chemiluminescent detection according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was reblotted with anti-actin antibody to verify equal loading of protein in each lane. HUVECs were cultured in 24-well plates. At subconfluence, the medium was replaced with medium without phenol red in the presence or absence of VEGF, l-NAME, andd-NAME. After a 30-min incubation, this medium was collected, and total NO was measured with a nitrate/nitrite colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The measured value was normalized to the number of HUVECs in the well from which the medium was collected. HUVECs were stimulated with VEGF or TNF-α for 8 h. Then, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, removed by careful trypsinization, and washed again with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline before incubating with 20% fetal bovine serum for 30 min. After two washes, cells were incubated with an antibody against human VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline/fetal bovine serum and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter cytofluorometer (Becton Dickinson). The results were gated for mean fluorescence intensity above the fluorescence produced by the secondary antibody alone. Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion was measured by fluorescent labeling of leukocytes according to the methods of Akeson and Woods (20Akeson A.L. Woods C.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 163: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood leukocytes were separated from heparinized peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Histopaque-1077 density gradient centrifugation. The cells were labeled with Vybrant DiD (5 μm, 20 min, 37 °C, Molecular Probes) in phenol red-free RPMI containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The viability after labeling was always >95% as judged by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in adhesion medium (RPMI containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 20 mm HEPES). The leukocytes were added (1.5 × 106/ml, 200 μl/well) to confluent monolayers of HUVECs that had been grown in 24-well plates and treated with various reagents and blocking antibodies. The amount of labeled cells added was assessed by recording the fluorescence signal (total signal) using a fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a microplate reader (Molecular Device). After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were removed by washing four times with prewarmed RPMI. The fluorescent signal was reassessed by the microplate reader (adherent signal). The percentage of leukocytes adhering to HUVECs was calculated by the formula: % adherence = (adherent signal/total signal) × 100. All signals were visualized and analyzed by densitometric scanning (LAS-1000, Fuji Film, Tokyo). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was tested using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance was set atp < 0.05. We developed a method of RPA by which we can detect the mRNA levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and cyclophilin simultaneously. The addition of 20 ng/ml VEGF increased the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNAs as early as 2 h and produced a maximal effect at 4 h (Fig. 1,A and B). The higher expression levels declined thereafter, but the level of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 continued to be higher than control for up to 8 h. The maximum mean increases in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were 5.2-, 9.8-, and 2.2-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B). As a positive control, the addition of 1 ng/ml TNF-α for 1 h also markedly increased the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin (Fig.1 A). To examine the receptor/second messenger mechanisms leading to induction of adhesion molecules by VEGF, a receptor antagonist and various intracellular kinase inhibitors were added to 20 ng/ml VEGF-treated HUVECs. A specific KDR antagonist (SU1498, 20 μm) completely inhibited VEGF-stimulated expression of the adhesion molecule mRNAs (Fig. 2,A and B). Placenta growth factor is known to be a specific Flt-1 ligand (21Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10–500 ng/ml placenta growth factor did not produce any effect on expression of the adhesion molecules (data not shown). MEK 1/2 inhibitor (PD98059, 50 μm) did not produce any changes, whereas PLC inhibitor (U73122, 1 μm), NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC, 50 μg/ml), sphingosine kinase inhibitor (DMS, 5 μm), and PKC inhibitor (chelerythrine chloride, 5 μm) suppressed VEGF-induced expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin (Fig. 2,A and B). Unexpectedly, the PI 3′-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin, 30 nm) enhanced VEGF-induced expression of the three adhesion molecule mRNAs (Fig. 2,A and B). These results suggested that VEGF-stimulated expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNAs may be mediated mainly through activation of PLCγ and NF-κB, along with PI 3′-kinase-mediated suppression. The process appears to be independent of the MEK/ERK pathway. Because the expression of adhesion molecules is mainly regulated by NF-κB (22Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23Wrighton C.J. Hofer-Warbinek R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Exp.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 282-288Google Scholar), we examined NF-κB activity in HUVECs treated with VEGF in the absence or presence of various intercellular kinase inhibitors. The addition of 20 ng/ml VEGF increased NF-κB activity as early as 0.5 h and produced a maximal effect at 1 h (Fig. 3,A and D). These effects declined but continued to be higher than control levels up to 6 h. The maximum mean increase in NF-κB activity was 5.8-fold. As a positive control, the addition of 1 ng/ml TNF-α for 1 h increased NF-κB activity. A 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor almost completely blocked the NF-κB binding site, whereas the irrelevant oligonucleotide, Oct-1, did not produce any effect on the binding site. The MEK 1/2 inhibitor (PD98059, 50 μm) did not produce any change in VEGF-induced NF-κB activity, whereas KDR antagonist (SU1498, 20 μm), PLC inhibitor (U73122, 1 μm), NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC, 50 μg/ml), sphingosine kinase inhibitor (DMS, 5 μm), and PKC inhibitor (chelerythrine chloride, 5 μm) suppressed VEGF-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 3, B and D). PI 3′-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin, 30 nm) enhanced VEGF-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 3, B and D). Overall, VEGF-induced NF-κB activity was correlated with the expression of adhesion molecules by VEGF. We performed supershift experiments using specific antibodies to p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 to reveal the identities of the proteins in the VEGF-induced NF-κB binding complex. Incubation with antibody to p65 or p50, but not with antibody to RelB, c-Rel, or p52, shifted the protein·DNA complexes (Fig.3 C). These data indicate that VEGF activates NF-κB in the form of a p65·p50 heterodimer in HUVECs. The addition of NOS inhibitor l-NAME (3 mm), but not its inactive D isomer d-NAME (3 mm), markedly suppressed basal and VEGF-stimulated NOS activity (Table I). Under these conditions, basal and VEGF-stimulated expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin was not changed (Fig. 4,A and B). The addition of PI 3′-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (30 nm) markedly suppressed basal and VEGF-stimulated NOS activity (Table I). Under these conditions, both the basal and the VEGF-stimulated expression of the three adhesion molecules was enhanced (Fig. 4,A and B). Inhibition of PI 3′-kinase activity with 100 nm LY294002 produced a similar effect (data not shown). Alternatively, activation of PI 3′-kinase with 50 microunits of insulin suppressed basal and VEGF-stimulated expression of the three adhesion molecules (Fig. 4, A and B).Table IEffect of VEGF on production of NO metabolites in HUVECsControl bufferVEGF (20 ng/ml)nmol/106 cellsControl buffer0.12 ± 0.021.18 ± 0.25 1-ap < 0.05versus control buffer.l-NAME (3 mm)0.06 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.05versus control buffer.0.32 ± 0.06 1-bp < 0.05versus time 20 ng/ml VEGF plus control buffer.d-NAME (3 mm)0.11 ± 0.021.26 ± 0.22 1-ap < 0.05versus control buffer.Wortmannin (30 nm)0.08 ± 0.020.38 ± 0.08 1-bp < 0.05versus time 20 ng/ml VEGF plus control buffer.HUVECs were pretreated with or without NOS and PI 3′-kinase inhibitors for 10 min.

The NO metabolites in culture media were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean ± S.D. from five experiments. Because ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 showed the strongest response to VEGF among the three molecules we examined, we looked further at the protein levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HUVECs treated with VEGF. The addition of 20 ng/ml VEGF increased protein levels of ICAM-1 as early as 2 h and produced a maximal effect at 6–12 h (Fig. 5 A, upper panels). These effects declined but continued to be higher than control levels up to 18 h. The maximum mean increase in ICAM-1 was 8.7-fold. The addition of 20 ng/ml VEGF increased protein levels of VCAM-1 as early as 2 h and produced a maximal effect at 4–6 h (Fig. 5 A, lower panels). These effects declined but continued to be higher than control levels up to 12 h. The maximum mean increase in VCAM-1 was 6.5-fold. 1 ng/ml TNF-α, used as a positive control, increased protein levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 markedly at 6 h. The effect of various inhibitors on VEGF-induced protein levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was similar to their effect on VEGF-induced mRNA levels. MEK 1/2 inhibitor did not produce any changes, whereas inhibitors of PLC, NF-κB, and PKC suppressed VEGF-induced protein levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (Fig. 5 B). PI 3′-kinase inhibitor enhanced VEGF-induced protein levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (Fig. 5 B). Using flow cytometry, we also confirmed that the protein levels of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on the endothelial cell surface increased after treatment of 20 ng/ml VEGF for 8 h (data not shown). Because the induction of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells induces leukocyte adhesiveness, we examined whether VEGF induces leukocyte adhesion to HUVECs. Accordingly, the addition of 20 ng/ml VEGF produced ∼3.1-fold increases in leukocyte adhesiveness after 8 h compared with the addition of control buffer (Fig. 6,A and B). Tje Flk-1/KDR antagonist (SU1498, 20 μm), MEK 1/2 inhibitor (PD98059, 50 μm) PLC inhibitor (U73122, 1 μm), NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC, 50 μg/ml), and PKC inhibitor (chelerythrine chloride, 5 μm) all suppressed basal and VEGF-induced leukocyte adhesiveness (Fig. 6, A andB). However, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin, 30 nm) produced a profoundly variable effect on VEGF-induced leukocyte adhesiveness (Fig. 6, A and B). Although functional blocking antibodies to ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin did not produce significant changes in basal leukocyte adhesiveness, they reduced VEGF-induced leukocyte adhesiveness (Fig. 6,A and B). A triple combination of these antibodies produced marked suppression of VEGF-induced leukocyte adhesiveness (Fig. 6, A and B). VEGF exerts its action by binding to two cell surface receptors, Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1 (25Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In Flk-1/KDR null mutant mice, development of endothelial and hematopoietic cells is impaired (26Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). Flt-1 null mutant mice have an apparent overgrowth of endothelial cells, accompanied by blood vessel disorganization (27Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The distinct phenotypes of the Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1 knockout animals show that these receptors have different biological functions. Therefore, it is likely that the two VEGF receptors signal through different transduction pathways. Our results indicate that a specific Flk-1/KDR antagonist completely blocked VEGF-induced expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin and blocked VEGF-induced NF-κB activity. However, a specific Flt-1 ligand, placenta growth factor, did not produce any effect on the expression of the adhesion molecules. Thus, VEGF-induced expression of adhesion proteins in endothelial cells occurs through VEGF binding to the Flk-1/KDR receptor, but not to the Flt-1 receptor (Fig.7). Upon activation of the Flk-1/KDR receptor in endothelial cells, three major second messenger pathways elicit cell proliferation, migration, survival, and NO production (7Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H.

Pharmacological inhibition of PI 3′-kinase with wortmannin and LY294002 completely inhibited these VEGF-induced cellular effects in endothelial cells (9Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (14Fulton D. Gratton J.-P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 15Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar), we found that pharmacological inhibition of PI 3′-kinase with wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited basal and VEGF-induced NO production. However, unexpectedly, our data indicated that under PI 3′-kinase inhibition, the basal expression levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNA were higher. Furthermore, under PI 3′-kinase inhibition, VEGF-induced expression levels were higher. Alternatively, insulin, an activator of PI 3′-kinase, decreased basal and VEGF-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression. These data strongly suggest that PI 3′-kinase could be an intracellular suppressor for the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin through yet unidentified signaling pathways (Fig. 7). To our knowledge, these results are the first to demonstrate an additional role of PI 3′-kinase in suppressing the expression of adhesion molecules. Thus, selective activation of PI 3′-kinase suppresses the induction of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin in endothelial cells. Therefore, PI 3′-kinase may decrease inflammatory responses, and a selective activator of PI 3′-kinase could be considered as a therapeutic agent for reducing a VEGF-induced inflammation in endothelial cells. A previous report indicated that VEGF induces expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a chemokine that is involved in recruiting leukocytes to sites of inflammation, mainly through activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in retinal endothelial cells (28Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The MEK/ERK system is not involved in VEGF-induced activation of NF-κB, but it is involved in VEGF-induced activation of AP-1 in the VEGF-induced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (28Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). VEGF/Flk-1/KDR binding triggers a signaling cascade that results in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ (7Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 11He H. Venema V.J. Gu X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5096-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLCγ increases intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate elevates intracellular calcium through an efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum. The increase in intracellular calcium also can activate sphingosine kinase to produce sphingosine 1-phosphate (29Olivera A. Edsall L. Poulton S. Kazlauskas A. Spiegel S. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In turn, the increase in intracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate activates PKC. In addition, activated PLCγ also activates PKC by increasing diacylglycerol. Activated PKC is known to be a strong activator of NF-κB (30Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). There is ample evidence that activation of NF-κB stimulates expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNAs in endothelial cells (22Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23Wrighton C.J. Hofer-Warbinek R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Exp.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 282-288Google Scholar). Thus, VEGF-induced activation of PLCγ and PKC is an essential step for induction of these adhesion molecule mRNAs in endothelial cells, and the induction occurs through NF-κB activation (Fig. 7). Upon activation of the Flk-1/KDR receptor, increased intracellular calcium and the activation of PKC or Akt result in activation of endothelial NOS and thus increased production of NO (11He H.

Thus, NO may modulate expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 at the translational level but not at the transcriptional level. Upon activation of Flk-1/KDR, MEK/ERK signal messenger transduction pathways are activated and lead to cellular proliferation (10Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 12Thakker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol.

Pharmacological inhibition of MEK/ERK pathways with PD98059 did not have any effect on the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNAs. Thus, NO and the MEK/ERK system are not involved in VEGF-stimulated expression of adhesion molecules (Fig. 7). Induction of adhesion molecules is an initial step in inflammation mediated by leukocyte adhesion. Previous reports have shown that VEGF did not affect the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (33Richard L. Velasco P. Detmar M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas VEGF increased the expression of ICAM-1, but not VCAM-1 and E-selectin, in vivoin retinal capillary endothelial cells (34Lu M. Perez V.L. Ma N. Miyamoto K. Peng H.B. Liao J.K. Adamis A.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 1808-1812PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that VEGF increased the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin in HUVECs. Endothelial cells from different areas have different characteristics and different responses to growth factors (35Risau W. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 36Thurston G. Baluk P. McDonald D.M. Microcirculation. 2000; 7: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of adhesion molecules in response to VEGF may be different between large vessel endothelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells. Our results clearly indicated that VEGF increased VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein in a time-dependent manner. Accordingly, VEGF increased leukocyte adhesion in endothelial cells. Leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells requires multiple cellular steps and intracellular second messenger signaling systems. Although the kinase inhibitors used in this study could be involved in multiple downstream effects in the response of the endothelial cells to VEGF, there were close relationships between induction of adhesion molecules and leukocyte adhesiveness. In addition, a combination of specific blocking antibodies to ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin significantly inhibited VEGF-induced leukocyte adhesiveness to endothelial cells. Thus, VEGF-induced adhesion molecules in endothelial cells is closely involved in VEGF-induced leukocyte adhesiveness. In summary, the present results explain how VEGF stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules in HUVECs. Our results show that VEGF-stimulated expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNAs was mainly through activation of PLCγ and NF-κB. The induction was suppressed by a PI 3′-kinase-mediated pathway but was independent of NO and MEK/ERK. Thus, VEGF simultaneously activates two signal tranduction pathways that have opposite functions in the induction of adhesion molecule expression.

https://openalex.org/W2028546686,"Feedforward models of visual cortex appear to be inconsistent with a well-known property of cortical cells: contrast invariance of orientation tuning. The models' fixed threshold broadens orientation tuning as contrast increases, whereas in real cells tuning width is invariant with contrast. We have compared the orientation tuning of spike and membrane potential responses in single cells. Both are contrast invariant, yet a threshold-linear relation applied to the membrane potential accurately predicts the orientation tuning of spike responses. The key to this apparent paradox lies in the noisiness of the membrane potential. Responses that are subthreshold on average are still capable of generating spikes on individual trials. Unlike the iceberg effect, contrast invariance remains intact even as threshold narrows orientation selectivity. Noise may, by extension, smooth the average relation between membrane potential and spike rate throughout the brain."

In developing thymocytes, NBS1 and gamma-H2AX form nuclear foci that colocalize with the T cell receptor alpha locus in response to recombination activating gene (RAG) protein-mediated VDJ cleavage. Our results suggest that surveillance of T cell receptor recombination intermediates by NBS1 and gamma-H2AX may be important for preventing oncogenic translocations."
https://openalex.org/W1994387916,"Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes express a different repertoire of chemokine receptors (CCRs). CXCR3, the receptor for I-TAC (interferon-inducible T cell α-chemoattractant), Mig (monokine induced by γ-interferon), and IP10 (interferon-inducible protein 10), is expressed preferentially on Th1 cells, whereas CCR3, the receptor for eotaxin and several other CC chemokines, is characteristic of Th2 cells. While studying responses that are mediated by these two receptors, we found that the agonists for CXCR3 act as antagonists for CCR3. I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 compete for the binding of eotaxin to CCR3-bearing cells and inhibit migration and Ca2+changes induced in such cells by stimulation with eotaxin, eotaxin-2, MCP-2 (monocyte chemottractant protein-2), MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). A hybrid chemokine generated by substituting the first eight NH2-terminal residues of eotaxin with those of I-TAC bound CCR3 with higher affinity than eotaxin or I-TAC (3- and 10-fold, respectively). The hybrid was 5-fold more potent than I-TAC as an inhibitor of eotaxin activity and was effective at concentrations as low as 5 nm. None of the antagonists described induced the internalization of CCR3, indicating that they lack agonistic effects and thus qualify as pure antagonists.

Two main subfamilies (CXC and CC chemokines) are distinguished depending on the arrangement of the first two cysteines, which are separated by one amino acid (CXC) or are adjacent (CC). All chemokines act via seven-transmembrane-domain receptors coupled to G proteins, which also form two subfamilies, CXC and CC chemokine receptors (CXCRs and CCRs).1Depending on function and pathophysiological roles, it is possible to distinguish between inflammatory and homing chemokines. Inflammatory chemokines are produced in most tissues under pathological conditions upon stimulation by cytokines and bacterial toxins, whereas homing chemokines are produced constitutively at homing sites. In the past few years it was found that lymphocytes can express most chemokine receptors in relation to their state of maturation, activation, and differentiation. CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR3, for instance, are up-regulated in T cells by treatment with IL-2 and are expressed differentially in Th1 and Th2 cells (1Baggiolini M.

Zanni M.P. Uguccioni M. Loetscher M. Mackay C.R. Pichler W.J. Yawalkar N. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Curr.

In such infiltrates, Th2 cells are believed to promote inflammation by releasing IL-4 and IL-5 as priming and survival factors for eosinophil and basophil leukocytes (8Corrigan C.J. Kay A.B. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 501-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). CCR5, on the other hand, is characteristic for Th1 cells, which also express high levels of CXCR3. Th1 cells accumulate in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and autoimmune inflammation (9Loetscher P. Uguccioni M. Bordoli L. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Chizzolini C. Dayer J.M.

Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar). The eotaxins are highly selective for CCR3, whereas RANTES and the MCPs recognize additional CC chemokine receptors. Eotaxin is expressed in a wide variety of cells, including eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelial and epithelial cells, and is critically involved in the regulation of the basal and inflammation-dependent traffic of eosinophils (11Gutierrez-Ramos J.C.

In eotaxin-deficient mice and in animals treated with antibodies that neutralize eotaxin, eosinophil infiltration of the airways is markedly reduced (13Rothenberg M.E. MacLean J.A. Pearlman E.

CXCR3 is highly expressed on T cells activated with IL-2 and binds selectively I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 (4Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar). Of the three ligands, I-TAC has the highest receptor affinity and is the most potent agonist, as shown by chemotaxis and Ca2+mobilization assays (16Cole K.E. Strick C.A. Paradis T.J. Ogborne K.T. Loetscher M. Gladue R.P. Lin W. Boyd J.G. Moser B. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neote K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2009-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). A notable feature of I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 is that their production is induced by interferon-γ, a cytokine that is typically associated with Th1 responses (16Cole K.E. Strick C.A. Paradis T.J. Ogborne K.T. Loetscher M. Gladue R.P. Lin W. Boyd J.G. Moser B. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neote K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2009-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 17Baggiolini M. Dewald B.

IP10, for instance, is expressed in skin lesions caused by delayed-type hypersensitivity, psoriasis, and tuberculoid leprosy, where interferon-γ expression is enhanced. While studying the activities of several chemokines on Th1 and Th2 cells, we observed that I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 act as antagonists for CCR3. These data suggest that CXCR3 agonists in addition to attracting CXCR3-bearing cells have the capacity to inhibit responses mediated via CCR3. All chemokines and chemokine analogs were synthesized chemically using tBoc (tertiary butyloxycarbonyl) solid-phase chemistry (19Clark-Lewis I. Vo L. Owen P. Anderson J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by electron spray mass spectrometry. For each chemokine used, the mass determined by mass spectrometry corresponded to the expected value. Eosinophils (>98% pure) were purified from venous blood of healthy volunteers (20Rot A.

Labeling was done with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako). Receptor function was assessed by Ca2+ mobilization in response to the appropriate chemokine. Competition binding assays were performed with CCR3-B300-19 cells using125I-eotaxin labeled by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (37Gong J.H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, the maximal binding of labeled eotaxin was determined by measuring binding at saturating concentrations; the bindability was about 20%. 5 × 106 cells were incubated with 4 nm125I-eotaxin and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (10−9-3 × 10−5m) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing Hepes (25 mm, pH 7.4), bovine serum albumin (10 mg ml−1), and sodium azide (0.1%). The incubations were carried out for 30 min at 4 °C, and cell-associated radioactivity was separated immediately by spinning the cells through a 2:3 mixture of diacetylphthalate and dibutylphthalate. The cpm that specifically bound to cells was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific cpm (the cpm bound in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled eotaxin) from the total cpm that was bound to the cells. Dissociation constants (K values) were determined by Scatchard analysis using the computer program LIGAND (38Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ mobilization was assayed in Fura-2-loaded cells after single or sequential stimulation with chemokines or chemokine analogs by recording [Ca2+]i-related fluorescence changes (39von Tscharner V. Prod'hom B. Baggiolini M. Reuter H. Nature. 1986; 324: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The rate of the change was expressed as the percentage of Fura-2 saturation/s. Chemotaxis was assessed in 48-well Boyden microchambers (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA) with 5-μm pores (30Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions and chemokine dilutions were made in RPMI 1640 containing 1% pasteurized plasma protein (Swiss Red Cross Laboratory, Bern, Switzerland) and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Migration was allowed to proceed for 2 h, and migrated cells were counted at a ×1000 magnification in 5 fields/well. All determinations were performed in triplicate. Chemokine-induced internalization was assayed as described (40Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Briefly, CCR3-B300-19 or CXCR3-B300-19 cells were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C with the chemokine to be tested at a 1 μm concentration. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, surface-bound ligands were removed by exposure to 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 3.0, containing 100 mm NaCl for 1 min followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Receptor expression was then determined by flow cytometry (see “Receptor Binding and Functional Assays”), and the relative fluorescence intensity was calculated (41Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The migration of CCR3-B300-19 cells and of human eosinophils in response to eotaxin was inhibited by I-TAC, Mig, and IP10, as shown for I-TAC in Fig.1, A and B. The inhibition of chemotaxis induced by optimum concentrations of eotaxin was concentration-dependent and was complete at 100–1000 nm (Fig. 1, C and D). I-TAC and Mig were equally effective and somewhat more potent than IP10. None of the CXCR3 ligands induced chemotaxis of CCR3-B300-19 cells or eosinophils (not shown). As shown in Fig.2, the [Ca2+]i rise induced by eotaxin in CCR3-bearing cells was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by pretreatment with I-TAC, which was completely inhibitory between 100 and 1000 nm. I-TAC, on the other hand, did not induce [Ca2+]ichanges in CCR3-B300-19 cells or eosinophils, even at high concentrations, confirming that it is devoid of agonistic activity on CCR3 and indicating that it is a pure antagonist. Experiments with Th2 cells, which express CCR3 and CXCR3, show that blockade of CCR3 can occur concomitantly with the activation of CXCR3 (Fig. 2 B). Marked [Ca2+]i changes were observed after stimulation with increasing concentrations of I-TAC, which in turn prevented the response to eotaxin. Ca2+ mobilization induced by eotaxin in CCR3-B300-19 cells and Th2 cells was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by all three CXCR3-selective chemokines (Fig. 2, C and D). I-TAC was the most potent antagonist, followed by Mig and IP10. In agreement with the chemotaxis assays, these results show that I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 significantly inhibit CCR3-dependent responses of Th2 cells at concentrations as low as 1 nm (Fig. 2 B). CCR3-B300-19 cells were less susceptible, presumably because they express higher numbers of receptors (Fig. 2 C). As several chemokines bind and activate CCR3, it was important to test the effect of the antagonists on responses induced by different ligands. As shown in Fig. 3, I-TAC prevented the [Ca2+]i changes elicited in CCR3-B300-19 cells by eotaxin, eotaxin-2, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES, demonstrating that the antagonistic effect is not dependent on the CCR3 agonist used. It was also important to test the specificity of the antagonists to block chemokine receptor-mediated responses. In a panel of 14 receptor-transfected B300-19 cell lines, I-TAC (the most potent of the three CCR3 antagonists) abrogated the [Ca2+]i changes in response to stimulation with the appropriate chemokine only in CCR3-expressing cells (Fig.4). I-TAC was slightly inhibitory on CCR5 (30–40% decrease of the [Ca2+]i rise in three experiments) but had no effect on all other receptors, indicating that its antagonistic activity is restricted largely to CCR3.Figure 4Effect of I-TAC on [Ca2+]i changes in chemokine receptor transfected B300-19 cells. The cells loaded with Fura-2 were left untreated (buffer) or exposed to 1000 nm I-TAC and stimulated after 60 s with a 10 nmreceptor-specific chemokine. [Ca2+]i-dependent fluorescence changes are shown. The results are representative of two to three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been reported that eotaxin and MCP-4, which are agonists for CCR3, bind to CXCR3 and that eotaxin prevents [Ca2+]ichanges induced by IP10 (42Weng Y. Siciliano S.J. Waldburger K.E. Sirotina-Meisher A. Staruch M.J. Daugherty B.L. Gould S.L. Springer M.S. DeMartino J.A. J. Biol.

In view of the observed antagonism for CCR3, we tested the effect of eotaxin and MCP-4 on CXCR3-B300-19 cells that were stimulated with I-TAC, Mig, and IP10. Neither eotaxin nor MCP-4 inhibited Ca2+ mobilization or chemotaxis induced by I-TAC, Mig, and IP10, indicating that their effect on CXCR3 was negligible (data for I-TAC are shown in Fig.5). It has been suggested that chemokines dock onto receptors by interacting with the loop region that follows the second cysteine and that the docking facilitates a triggering of the receptor by the NH2-terminal domain (43Crump M.P.

In the attempt to enhance the antagonistic effect, we synthesized a hybrid chemokine by substituting the NH2-terminal region of eotaxin with that of I-TAC. As shown in Fig. 6, I-TAC/EoH1, corresponding to eotaxin with the first eight amino acids of I-TAC, was about 5-fold more potent than I-TAC itself as an inhibitor of CCR3-dependent [Ca2+]i changes and chemotaxis. I-TAC/EoH1 was also tested on CXCR3-bearing cells and was found to have moderate agonistic and no antagonistic activity (data not shown). The relative affinities of I-TAC, I-TAC/EoH1, Mig, and IP10 to CCR3 were determined by binding competition assays with 125I-labeled eotaxin (Fig.7). All antagonists fully displaced labeled eotaxin. I-TAC/EoH1 was the most potent competitor (K d 4.5 ± 1.0 nm,n = 3) followed by eotaxin (K d13.5 ± 1.9 nm, n = 3) and I-TAC (K d 65.0 ± 7.7 nm,n = 3), whereas the affinity of Mig (K d 4065 ± 1, 231 nm,n = 3) and IP10 (K d 1582 ± 154 nm, n = 3) was comparatively low. Overall, the binding data are in agreement with the observed antagonistic activities. The affinity of Mig, however, was lower than expected. Binding of chemokines leads to a rapid receptor internalization, which is not observed on binding of antagonists (40Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 47Blanpain C. Migeotte I. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization was determined in cells expressing either CCR3 or CXCR3 by flow cytometry measurements of surface receptors before and after ligand exposure. As shown in Fig.8, in CCR3-bearing cells, receptor uptake was induced by eotaxin only. In CXCR3-bearing cells, on the other hand, receptor uptake was observed with I-TAC, Mig, IP10, and I-TAC/EoH1 but not with eotaxin. Together with the functional data, these results show that the CXCR3 ligands lack agonistic activity and act on CCR3 as pure antagonists. This paper shows that I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 are potent antagonists for CCR3 and prevent the responses of Th2 cells and eosinophils to CCR3-binding chemokines. The search for chemokine antagonists began several years ago when chemokine receptor blockade was recognized as a possible therapeutic approach for inflammatory diseases. It is well established that antagonists can be generated by modifying the NH2-terminal region of natural chemokines (48Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Studies were performed first with IL-8 and other ELR chemokines yielding antagonists for CXCR1 and CXCR2 (49Moser B. Dewald B.

The same principle proved valid for CC chemokines, as shown by the effects obtained upon NH2-terminal truncation of MCP-1, MCP-3, and RANTES (37Gong J.H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M.

Nature. 1996; 383 (400): 400Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that, as a rule, receptor recognition depends on structural motifs located in the loop region of chemokines that follows the second cysteine. Extensive structure-activity studies of SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1) led to the proposal of a two-step interaction of chemokines with their receptors, involving specific docking via the loop region and subsequent triggering by the NH2-terminal region preceding the first cysteine (43Crump M.P.

In some cases, however, NH2-terminal truncation did not yield derivatives with antagonistic properties. This result was observed with eotaxin and IP10, which lose the capacity to bind to CCR3 and CXCR3, respectively, when only a few NH2-terminal residues are deleted. 2I. Clark-Lewis, P. Loetscher, M.

It was also shown that dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26) reduces the activity of eotaxin by cleaving off the first two NH2-terminal residues (54Struyf S. Proost P. Schols D. De Clercq E. Opdenakker G. Lenaerts J.P. Detheux M. Parmentier M. De M., I Scharpe S. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4903-4909PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the naturally occurring I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 block CCR3 was unexpected, because normally CXC and CC chemokines discriminate precisely between CXC and CC chemokine receptors. Our data suggest that CCR3 and CXCR3, despite their overall sequence identity of only 34%, share sufficient structural similarity within domains that determine the binding of I-TAC, Mig, and IP10, on the one hand, and the binding and triggering by eotaxins, MCPs, and RANTES on the other. The existence of binding-relevant homology between CXCR3 and CCR3 is suggested in particular by the observation that the potency ranking for CCR3 antagonism, I-TAC > Mig > IP10, as shown in the present study, and the potency ranking for agonistic activity via CXCR3 as determined by Cole et al. (16Cole K.E. Strick C.A. Paradis T.J. Ogborne K.T. Loetscher M. Gladue R.P. Lin W. Boyd J.G. Moser B. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neote K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2009-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) are the same. It is also noteworthy that NH2-terminal truncation of IP10 leads to a loss of agonistic activity on CXCR3 as well as a loss of antagonistic effects on CCR3 (data not shown). We found that CXCR3 ligands block CCR3, but we were unable to demonstrate the converse; this contrasts with the report of Weng et al. (42Weng Y. Siciliano S.J. Waldburger K.E. Sirotina-Meisher A. Staruch M.J. Daugherty B.L. Gould S.L. Springer M.S. DeMartino J.A. J. Biol.

It has been reported that murine secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine has agonistic activity on murine CXCR3 (55Soto H. Wang W. Strieter R.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hedrick J. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8205-8210Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Human secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, on the other hand, is inactive on human and murine CXCR3 (Ref. 56Jenh C.H. Cox M.A. Kaminski H. Zhang M. Byrnes H. Fine J. Lundell D. Chou C.C. Narula S.K. Zavodny P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3765-3769PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). Attempts to design high affinity antagonists by NH2-terminal truncation of eotaxin have been unsuccessful. This paper presents an alternative approach. After realizing that CXCR3 and CCR3 receptors may have homologous binding domains, we synthesized a hybrid by replacing the NH2-terminal region of eotaxin with that of I-TAC. Eotaxin was chosen because it has the highest affinity for CCR3 and I-TAC because it is the best CCR3 antagonist. Substitution of the NH2-terminal region led to the loss of receptor triggering activity, whereas retaining high affinity binding yielded a chemokine analog with higher affinity to CCR3 than eotaxin and I-TAC. Several lines of evidence indicate that I-TAC, Mig, IP10, and I-TAC/EoH1 are pure CCR3 antagonists. These ligands did not induce chemotaxis or [Ca2+]i changes in CCR3-bearing cells and did not induce CCR3 internalization, which is an agonist-mediated event due to the phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and subsequent uptake in clathrin-coated pits (57Koenig J.A.

In agreement with these findings, CXCR3 was internalized to different extents by I-TAC, Mig, IP10, and I-TAC/EoH1. Inflammatory and immune reactions are characterized by the production of chemokines in the affected tissues, leading to the infiltration of leukocytes that bear the appropriate receptors. The local expression of chemokines is often induced by cytokines. In the context of this paper, it is important to realize that I-TAC, Mig, and IP10, which attract CXCR3-bearing cells, are induced by interferon-γ (16Cole K.E. Strick C.A. Paradis T.J. Ogborne K.T.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 60-68PubMed Google Scholar). The infiltrate observed in the presence of interferon-γ is rich in Th1 cells, whereas Th2 cells predominate under the influence of IL-4. The present observations suggest that CXCR3-selective chemokines enhance this polarization by acting as antagonists of CCR3 and thus inhibiting the infiltration of Th2 cells, in addition to their effect as attractants of Th1 cells via CXCR3. This paper describes a new mechanism for the regulation of leukocyte recruitment by chemokines based on the combination of agonistic and antagonistic effects. We thank Regula Stuber, T. McLeod, G.

Mice expressing this transgene produced human insulin specifically in gut K cells. This insulin protected the mice from developing diabetes and maintained glucose tolerance after destruction of the native insulin-producing beta cells.

In nature, the parasite exists either as an extracellular promastigote found in the alimentary tract of sandflies or as an obligatory intracellular amastigote found in phagolysosomes of mammalian macrophages(1–3). During the last several years, a number of laboratories have utilized axenic culture of L. donovani amastigotes for the direct evaluation of cell biological and biochemical processes in the amastigote, devoid of the host macrophage (4–7,8,9,10). This technique has also been used to investigate the mechanism of drug action and resistance as well as for screening of potential new drugs(11–13). The treatment of choice of human visceral leishmaniasis is the administration of pentavalent antimony (SbV)-containing drugs such as sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam, Wellcome, Beckenham, UK) or meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime, Rhone-Poulenc, Paris, France). Despite extensive use of these compounds over the last decades, the mechanism of action remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that SbV is not toxic toLeishmania, but rather that it is enzymatically reduced, probably by the host macrophage, to SbIII, the form of antimony that is highly Leishmania-toxic (14Goodwin L.G. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1995; 89: 339-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Goodwin L.G. Page J.E. Biochem. J. 1943; 22: 236-240Google Scholar, 16Berman J.D.

Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1842-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that SbV is directly toxic to axenic amastigotes (12Ephros M. Bitnun A. Shaked P. Waldman E. Zilberstein D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 278-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ephros M. Waldman E. Zilberstein D. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 818-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus negating the necessity of the macrophage for SbV reduction. Furthermore, these data imply that either the parasite reduces SbV to SbIIIintracellularly, and thus SbIII is directly toxic to amastigotes, or that both oxidation states of antimony are active against Leishmania amastigotes. The modes of action of the two oxidation states of antimony (SbIII and SbV) on Leishmania are, as yet, not fully understood. Several groups have shown obligatory cross-resistance between SbV, SbIII, and arsenite (AsIII) inLeishmania tarentolae, Leishmania major,Leishmania mexicana, L. donovani and Leishmania infantum (11Sereno D.

In contrast, it has been suggested that, at least in L. donovani, such cross-resistance does not necessarily occur (12Ephros M. Bitnun A. Shaked P. Waldman E. Zilberstein D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 278-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that, when bound to organic compounds, structural similarities exist between SbIII and SbV (23Roberts W.L. McMurray W.J. Rainey P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the trivalent antimony compound potassium antimonyl tartrate has a structure resembling that of the pentavalent antimony compound sodium stibogluconate. Thus it is conceivable that SbV and SbIII act on a common parasite target molecule. It is also possible that, when given together, these compounds might act additively or synergistically, or might inhibit one another. It is also possible that at least part of the anti-leishmanial activity of AsIII may not be mediated by a mechanism similar to that of antimony despite the fact that cross-resistance in otherLeishmania species has been observed (11,20–22). To understand the relationships between these compounds and their activity against L. donovani, antimony accumulation and its subsequent intracellular metabolism were investigated using novel antimony speciation methods. Sodium stibogluconate (powder) was a gift from The Wellcome Trust (Beckenham, UK). Potassium antimonyl tartrate was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO.). [3H]Thymidine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Medium 199 and fetal calf serum were obtained from Biological Industries, Inc. (Bet Haemeek, Israel). Materials for antimony determinations were as follows: sodium tetrahydridoborate (puriss. p.a. for determination of hydride formers) and potassium fluoride (MicroSelect; >99.5% purity) were obtained from Fluka, Inc. (Seelze, Germany), potassium iodide (puriss, p.a.; >99% purity) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (Deisenhofen, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. A cloned line of L.donovani 1SR (5,24) and the Pentostam-resistant mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20 (13Ephros M. Waldman E. Zilberstein D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Promastigotes were grown in medium 199 at 26 °C and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In vitro culture of amastigotes was performed as described by Saar et al. (5Saar Y. Asamoa R. Waldman E. Mazareb S. Amin-Spector S. Plumblee J. Turco S.J. Zilberstein D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Transformation of amastigotes to promastigotes was performed by centrifugation of amastigotes (1,200 × g, at room temperature for 10 min), suspension in promastigote medium, and incubation at 26 °C. Under these conditions, amastigotes differentiate to promastigotes within 48 h (5Saar Y. Asamoa R. Waldman E. Mazareb S. Amin-Spector S. Plumblee J. Turco S.J. Zilberstein D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Parasite viability was measured using a radiolabeled thymidine incorporation assay as follows: mid-log phase cells (∼5 × 105 cells/ml) were added in duplicate to 24-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (2-ml final volume). Drugs were serially added to the cells (either promastigotes or amastigotes), and cells were then incubated for 48 h at either 26 °C (promastigotes) or 37 °C in 5% CO2 (amastigotes). Subsequently, 10 μl of [3H]thymidine (0.1 mCi/ml) were added to each well and incubated for another 3 h (promastigotes) or 24 h (amastigotes). 1-ml aliquots from each well were centrifuged (1,200 × g at room temperature for 10 min) and added to 5 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, vortexed, and incubated on ice for about 20 min. Samples were then filtered through a glass microfiber filter (GF/C, Whatman International Ltd., Springfield Mill, UK) and washed once with 10 ml of cold trichloroacetic acid followed by 10 ml of 95% ethanol. Radioactivity was measured using β-scintillation counting. Results were expressed as percentage viability. L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes were incubated for 3, 6, or 12 h with potassium antimonyl tartrate (34 μg of SbIII/ml, 0.28 mm SbIII), sodium stibogluconate (1 mg of SbV/ml, 8.2 mm SbV), or both. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted with concentrated nitric acid. The content of antimony in each sample was measured using flow injection-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (FI-ICP-MS)1 atm/z 121 using water as solvent stream (flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, n = 5) under clean room conditions (class 1000). Each sample contained 100-μl aliquots of cell extract, which were diluted 1:100 with water (25Ulrich N. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1998; 359: 245-253Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Ulrich N. Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 360: 797-800Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For each measurement, aliquots of 10 μl were injected with five repetitions. Intracellular SbIII and SbV were measured using flow injection-hydride generation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (FI-HG-ICP-MS), which has recently been developed (27Ulrich N. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2000; 417: 201-209Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, SbIII was reduced to antimony hydride (SbH3) using 0.2% sodium tetrahydridoborate in de-ionized water and was directly quantified using mass spectrometry at m/z 121. To avoid SbV interference with the antimony hydride measurements, the SbV reduction was suppressed by the addition of 100 mg/liter of fluoride (as KF) to the solvent stream. Subsequently, SbV was reduced to antimony hydride in 2 steps; pre-reduction using 1.2% KI followed by reduction with 0.2% sodium tetrahydridoborate, both in de-ionized water as solvent stream. The SbV content in each sample was calculated as the difference between the absorbance determined after the second reduction (SbIII + SbV) and first reduction (SbIII). Nonreducible organic antimony is not detected by this method. For each measurement, aliquots of 100 μl were injected with five repetitions. Chromatographic separation of intracellular antimony was done as described by Ulrich et al. (28Ulrich N. Shaked-Mishan P. Zilberstein D. Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 368: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were diluted 1:100 with distilled water, and 100-μl aliquots from each preparation were injected into a laboratory-packed PRP-X100 HPLC column. SbV and SbIII were eluted from the column using 15 mm nitric acid and were directly injected to ICP-MS (m/z 121) for antimony absorbance. Each sample was filtered and degassed prior to chromatography. Antimony accumulation in promastigotes and amastigotes of both the wild-type and the mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20 was determined using two different methods. First, total intracellular antimony content was measured with FI-ICP-MS (25Ulrich N. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1998; 359: 245-253Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Ulrich N. Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 360: 797-800Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the results are summarized under “Total [Sb]i” in Tables 1 and 2. The second method used to determine the content of antimony hydride (SbH3) was FI-HG-ICP-MS (27Ulrich N. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2000; 417: 201-209Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Ulrich N.

In this method, SbV and SbIII in cell extracts were separately reduced to SbH3, which then flowed through the plasma to the mass spectrometer, where its concentration was subsequently determined (Tables 1 and 2, [SbV]i and [SbIII]i). This method enables the determination of the intracellular content of each of the antimony oxidation states.Table IAccumulation of antimony by L. donovani promastigotesParasitesExtracellular antimonyIntracellular antimony ng Sb/1 × 106 cellsTotal [Sb]i[SbIII]i[SbV]iLd1SR (WT)SbIII1-a34 μg of SbIII/ml, corresponding to 0.28 mM SbIII.50 ± 226 ± 23 ± 1Ld1SRSbV1-b1 mg of SbV/ml, corresponding to 8.2 mM SbV.98 ± 41.5 ± 0.374 ± 4Ld1SRSbIII + SbV183 ± 1229 ± 2127 ± 5Ld1SRNone0.6 ± 0.1Ld1S.20 (mutant)SbIII43 ± 224 ± 21.8 ± 0.2Ld1S.20SbV87 ± 41.3 ± 0.267 ± 3Ld1S.20SbIII + SbV143 ± 625 ± 2106 ± 5Ld1S.20None1.0 ± 0.2Promastigotes were incubated with potassium antimonyl tartrate (SbIII), sodium stibogluconate (SbV) or both for 12 h at 26 °C.

Cell extractions and intracellular antimony concentration determinations using FI-ICP-MS (total [Sb]i column) and FI-HG-ICP-MS ([SbIII]i and [SbV]i columns) were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table 1 (Total [Sb]i), in WT promastigotes, SbIII or SbV each accumulated intracellularly after a 12-h incubation. Furthermore, when WT promastigotes were simultaneously incubated with both SbV and SbIII, the total [Sb] measured intracellularly approximated the sum of the intracellular concentrations of the two antimony oxidation states when incubations were with SbV or SbIII alone. The same was true with promastigotes of the mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20. With a similar set of experiments using WT and mutant amastigotes, the data in Table 2 (Total [Sb]i) show that both SbIII and SbV were accumulated intracellularly. SbV accumulation was concentration-dependent, suggesting that its transport may be mediated by a permease. When compared with promastigotes, the transport of SbV into WT amastigotes is 6.7- and 4.9-fold greater, when incubation was with SbV alone or with both oxidation states concomitantly, respectively. SbIII accumulation was similar in promastigotes and amastigotes of both WT and mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20. The change in SbV accumulation in mutant amastigotes resembles that of WT amastigotes although to a lesser extent, with SbV accumulation increasing by only 4.9-fold. To determine the intracellular fate of antimony in both promastigotes and amastigotes, cell extracts of parasites treated with SbV, SbIII, or both, were analyzed for each of the antimony oxidation states using FI-HG-ICP-MS. The SbVconcentrations used were those that in competition experiments (Figs. 2and 3) resulted in 10 and 100% inhibition of SbIIItoxicity by SbV.Figure 3Effect of sodium stibogluconate (SbV) on the toxicity of potassium antimonyl tartrate (SbIII) or arsenite (AsIII) on L. donovani amastigotes.

The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In WT promastigotes incubated with either SbIII or SbV alone, only the specific oxidation state added to the extracellular medium was found intracellularly (Table 1, [SbIII]i and [SbV]i). Most of the accumulated SbV (76%) was identified as intracellular SbV, but only 52% of the accumulated SbIII was recovered by FI-HG-ICP-MS as SbIII. When the extracellular medium contained SbIII and SbV, both these forms were found intracellularly as well with similar SbIIIconcentrations. SbV accumulated at a 71% higher concentration when parasites were incubated with SbV and SbIII (versus with SbV alone). Similar results were obtained when these experiments were performed using mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20 promastigotes. In contrast to the above findings, when amastigotes of WT parasites were subjected to the same conditions (Table 2), both SbVand SbIII were detected intracellularly when parasites were incubated with only SbV. Thus, reduction of SbVto SbIII was observed in WT amastigotes incubated with SbV only. When incubated for 12 h with 0.2 mg of SbV/ml, WT amastigotes reduced 29% of the accumulated antimony to SbIII; 18% was reduced when incubation was with 1 mg of SbV/ml. This may indicate that the latter concentration is at saturation for enzymatic SbV reduction. In contrast, only minor levels of reduction of SbV to SbIII in mutant amastigotes occurred. Furthermore, the high level of SbIII accumulation by the mutant amastigotes (Table 2) rules out a possible role for active SbIII efflux in Ld1S.20 resistance to pentavalent antimony. The results in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that SbV is stable. No spontaneous reduction of SbV to SbIII was observed during the 12-h assays. Only 1% reduction was observed after a few weeks (not shown). This is in agreement with previous observations that SbV is stable in aqueous solutions even though the redox potential favors SbIII (29Lugo de Yarbuh A. Anez N. Petit de Pena Y. Burguera J.L. Burguera M. Annu. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1994; 88: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that rapid reduction of SbV requires intracellular catalytic activity of either an enzymatic or nonenzymatic nature. To further delineate the nature of the intracellular reduction of SbV, [SbIII]i was determined after 3-, 6-, and 12-h incubations of both WT and mutant promastigotes and amastigotes with SbV alone. As shown in Fig.1, WT amastigotes showed a time-dependent reduction of SbV whereas mutant amastigotes exhibited less than 0.025 of the reducing activity. Promastigotes, both WT and mutants, did not reduce SbV to any extent. The results in Fig. 1 and Tables 1 and 2 indicate that SbVreducing activity correlates with the previously documented stage-specific susceptibility of WT amastigotes to pentavalent antimony(12). However, in amastigotes, the intracellular concentration of SbV was 5-fold higher than in promastigotes, suggesting that it may also be toxic to amastigotes. To assess the specific role of SbV in the anti L. donovani activity of antimony, the intracellular relationship between SbV and SbIII was studied with competition assays. Dose response analyses were performed by incubating wild-type L. donovani 1SR with variable concentrations of sodium stibogluconate (SbV) and a fixed potassium antimonyl tartrate (SbIII) concentration equivalent to the LD90for WT L. donovani promastigotes (100 μg/ml = 34 μg of SbIII/ml). As shown in Fig.2 A, [SbV] of ≥ 200 μg/ml neutralized the toxicity of SbIII, resulting in no mortality at 1 mg/ml SbV. Also, the minimal SbV concentration required for reversion of SbIII toxicity declined with decreasing SbIIIconcentration (not shown). A similar relationship between SbV and SbIII was also shown with promastigotes from the Pentostam-resistant mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, SbV failed to reverse arsenite (AsIII) toxicity to L. donovani even at SbV concentrations as high as 5 mg/ml (Fig. 2, A and B). These data emphasize the specificity of the SbV-SbIII interaction in L. donovani promastigotes, both WT and mutant. For wild-type amastigotes, the dose-response curve for SbVin the presence of a fixed low dose of SbIII (3.4 μg of SbIII/ml, equivalent to the LD20) showed additive toxicity of SbV and SbIII (Fig.3 A). In the presence of 34 μg of SbIII/ml (equivalent to the LD90) no inhibition of SbIII toxicity by SbV was observed. This is in agreement with the previously reported stage-specific susceptibility of L. donovani to SbV (12Ephros M. Bitnun A. Shaked P. Waldman E. Zilberstein D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 278-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the same dose-response analysis was performed using amastigotes of the L. donovani mutant Ld1S.20, SbV inhibited SbIII toxicity in a fashion similar to that observed in promastigotes. As shown in Fig. 3 B, [SbV] ≥ 200 μg/ml reduced mortality caused by high dose SbIII (34 μg/ml SbIII), and at about 1 mg of SbV/ml no mortality was observed. When these mutant amastigotes were treated with AsIII instead of SbIII, SbV failed to reverse AsIII toxicity, further emphasizing the specificity of the SbV-SbIII competition. Differences in antimony intracellular accumulation and reducing activity were observed between promastigotes and amastigotes and between WT and mutant parasites. Furthermore, often total [Sb]i was greater than [SbV + SbIII]i (Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, to ascertain whether antimony metabolism other than oxidation or reduction occurs intracellularly, cell extracts from the above experiments were subjected to anion exchange chromatography, and fractions eluted from the column were directly subjected to ICP-MS. When a parasite-free solution containing both sodium stibogluconate and potassium antimonyl tartrate was subjected to HPLC anion exchange chromatography, two distinct peaks (SbV and SbIII), were identified. SbV and SbIII retention times were 100 and 300 s, respectively (not shown). Fig. 4 shows chromatograms of WT and mutant amastigotes and promastigotes incubated with SbV. As shown, when amastigotes were incubated with SbV, the SbIII peak was absent in the mutant but not in WT. This correlates with the lack of SbVreducing activity observed in the mutant amastigotes (Fig. 1). In both WT and mutant amastigotes, peaks other than free SbV and SbIII were detected. Differences in peaks A through F were apparent between WT and mutant. These peaks might represent covalent interactions of either SbV or SbIII with intracellular molecules. No major differences were observed between WT and mutant promastigotes when incubations were performed with SbV (Fig. 4,C and D). Despite the qualitative nature of the chromatographic results, the size of both the promastigote SbIII peaks (WT and mutant) was smaller than in WT amastigotes, further emphasizing the low level of SbVreducing activity in promastigotes (Fig. 1). Bacteria and yeast that live in environments contaminated with arsenate (AsV) reduce the element intracellularly to arsenite (AsIII) as part of the mechanism that was evolved to evade the toxic effects of this heavy metal (30Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Given thatLeishmania spp. are not necessarily exposed to heavy metals in their natural habitats (sandflies and vertebrates), they may not have developed this type of protective mechanism. In fact, by reducing nontoxic SbV Leishmania, they actually expose themselves to the lethal effects of SbIII. This work aimed to assess the role of SbV reduction in antimony toxicity to and resistance in L. donovani. The data presented herein show the following. 1) Intracellular stage-specific SbV reduction occurs in WT L. donovani 1SR and susceptibility to SbV correlates with the level of SbV reducing activity. 2) The SbV-resistant mutant amastigote of L. donovani Ld1S.20 is deficient in SbV intracellular reducing activity. 3) Antimony metabolism with stage-specific differences occurs in both promastigotes and amastigotes of WT L. donovani 1SR and 4) stage-specific intracellular competition between SbIII and SbV, but not AsIII, occurs in WT L. donovani 1SR. This competition is not related to antimony transport. The results of the experiments described indicate that SbVreverses the toxicity of SbIII to L. donovani promastigotes, in both the WT and the mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20. In addition, SbV and SbIII are toxic in an additive fashion to WT amastigotes. These data support previous findings that described the stage-specific toxicity of SbV, but not of SbIII, to L. donovani (12Ephros M. Bitnun A. Shaked P. Waldman E. Zilberstein D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 278-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20 amastigotes, a response similar to promastigotes was observed (inhibition). In both wild-type and mutant promastigotes and amastigotes, no cross-inhibition by SbV occurs when AsIII is substituted for SbIII. This suggests that, despite similar activity in other biological systems (30Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 31Rosen B.P. J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 6: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in L. donovani, antimony and arsenic may not act via similar mechanisms. FI-HG-ICP-MS and FI-ICP-MS data show that both antimony oxidation states, either individually or together, enter promastigotes and axenic amastigotes. The specific quantitative results for combined SbIII and SbV incubation rule out the possibility that competition occurs at the plasma membrane transport level. This is true for both promastigotes and amastigotes of both WT and mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20 parasites. Because SbV-SbIII antagonism does not take place at the transport level, the assumption that it transpires intracellularly has been borne out. Stage-specific intracellularL. donovani SbV reducing activity exists in WT amastigotes, which reduces negligibly toxic SbV to highly toxic SbIII. In WT promastigotes, the putative L. donovani stage-specific antimony reducing activity may be expressed at either a low level or may be of very low activity, thus explaining the negligible susceptibility of these promastigotes to SbV. In the mutant L. donovani Ld1S.20 amastigote SbVreducing activity is present either in small amounts or may be nonexistent; thus SbV accumulates intracellularly but is not reduced to SbIII. Consequently mutant amastigotes are less susceptible than WT to SbV. The data presented in Fig.1 indicate that in WT amastigotes, stage-specific SbVreducing activity occurs, whereas in the mutant amastigote, SbV reduction is less than 0.025 that of WT, thus SbV accumulates intracellularly but is not reduced to SbIII. Furthermore, the observation that both WT and mutant promastigotes and amastigotes accumulate SbIII to the same level (Tables 1 and 2) rules out a possible role for antimonite efflux as the reason for low level of SbIII reduction as well as for Ld1S.20 SbV resistance. The SbV reducing activity of L. donovani might resemble that of the arsenate reductase previously described in bacteria and yeast, which catalyzes reduction of AsV to AsIII (30Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 32Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 127-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21084-21089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is possible that an L. donovani enzyme that catalyzes SbV reduction plays a key role in parasite susceptibility to antimony. This possibility is currently being investigated in our laboratory. In WT amastigotes, despite SbV reduction, [SbV]i remains relatively high and theoretically should have inhibited the intracellular SbIIIpresent (Table 2), as seen in both WT and mutant promastigotes as well as in mutant amastigotes. However, the data presented in Fig.3 A show that this does not occur. This might suggest that SbV is directly toxic to WT amastigotes. If this is the case, it must be assumed that SbV toxicity is coupled with SbV reducing activity. Fig. 5 illustrates a model describing antimoniate reduction and the subsequent neutralization of SbIII by trypanothione. We propose that SbIIIaccumulates in cells by transport across the plasma membrane and/or by the intracellular reduction of SbV to SbIII via either an enzymatic or nonenzymatic mechanism. SbIII then complexes with trypanothione, and this complex is then extruded from the parasite via specific transporters, as has been previously proposed (20Haimeur A. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dey S. Ouellette M. Lightbody J. Papadopoulou B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Drug Resistance Updates. 1998; 1: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A mutation in a purported stage-specific SbVreductase would result in resistance of amastigotes to SbVbut not to SbIII. However, any mutation that occurs in enzymes involved in reactions downstream of the site of the proposed SbV stage-specific reducing activity should result in antimony as well as in arsenite-antimony cross-resistance. This could explain why others have reported SbV-SbIII-AsIII cross-resistance in various Leishmania species (11Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Zemzoumi K. Maquaire S. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3097-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Haimeur A. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Borst P. Ouellette M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the additional role of macrophage-associated antimony reduction in natural infection, as previously suggested (11Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Zemzoumi K. Maquaire S. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3097-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berman J.D. Waddell D. Hanson B.D. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), cannot be ruled out. In promastigotes, the observation that SbV inhibits SbIII toxicity is surprising. No similar phenomenon has been reported before. The intracellular SbV antagonism of SbIII toxicity in WT and mutant promastigotes as well as in mutant amastigotes could occur because of a number of possibilities. In solution, gluconic acid dissociates from antimony and is replaced by hydroxyl groups forming hexahydroxyl antimony, whereas tartrate remains conjugated to SbIII. Thus, SbV antagonism of SbIII is more likely to be a result of noncompetitive inhibition rather than of competitive inhibition (because of structural similarity). Alternatively, an inactive oxide hybrid is formed between potassium antimonyl tartrate and one-half of the sodium stibogluconate molecule. Because SbV is rapidly reduced to SbIII in amastigotes, such hybrids will probably not form. These possibilities are currently being investigated. The recently developed antimony anion exchange chromatography method (28Ulrich N. Shaked-Mishan P. Zilberstein D. Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 368: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that SbV is not only reduced but also metabolized by L. donovani. Peaks separated from cell extracts after SbV treatment (Fig. 4) suggest the possibility of covalent interactions of either SbV or SbIII with intracellular molecules. The bound antimony may not be reduced by BH4 (27Ulrich N. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2000; 417: 201-209Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), thus explaining the differences between total [Sb]i and the reducible intracellular SbV and SbIII measured in Tables 1 and 2. The amount of antimony accumulated in L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes are 20 and 300 times higher than that reported for L. panamensis (17Roberts W.L. Berman J.D. Rainey P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although this New World Leishmania species also exhibits stage-specific susceptibility to SbV, both developmental stages accumulate it to the same extent. Hence, it is likely that in New and Old World species, SbV acts via different modes of action. The novel approaches of FI-HG-ICP-MS, FI-ICP-MS, and anion exchange chromatography facilitated the description of intracellular antimony metabolism in L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes, both WT and mutant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of intracellular SbV reduction in parasitic protozoa as well as in any intact cell. We thank Prof. Stephen M. Beverley and Dr. Mark L. Cunningham for useful discussions."

Release of ATP via a conductive pathway has been implicated as an essential autocrine regulator of cell volume in rat hepatoma cells (5Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Moreover, ABC transporters have been shown to modulate volume-sensitive Cl− channels and cell volume (31Higgins C.F.

As such, we tested the hypotheses that CFTR facilitates ATP release under constitutive and hypotonic conditions for autocrine control of cell volume regulation. These hypotheses were also based on the fact that airway surface liquid on CF epithelia is hypertonic with respect to NaCl (35Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and/or reduced in volume (36Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C.

These airway surface liquid composition abnormalities may reflect an inability of CF epithelial cells to sense changes in external mucosal environment and/or an inability of CF cells to regulate their own cell volume. To this end, complimentary observations using a variety of techniques suggest that expression of CFTR enhances ATP release and modulates the dynamic relationship between cell volume, purinergic signaling, and membrane ion permeability. Given the cellular challenges related to changes in solute transport and maintenance of airway surface liquid, defective cell volume regulation in CF epithelia may underlie the pathogenesis of CF in the lung and airways. The 16HBE14o− non-CF human bronchial epithelial cell line, the 9HTEo− non-CF human tracheal epithelial cell line, and the CFBE41o− CF human bronchial epithelial cell line (homozygous for the ΔF508-CFTR mutation) were grown as described previously (39Kunzelmann K.

CFT-1 cells were grown in LHC-8 medium (Biofluids; Rockville, MD) without serum. For consistency, all CFTR cell models were grown on similar substrates and in similar media. COS-7 cells were seeded to 33% confluence 1 day prior to transfection with LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (45Schwiebert L.M. Estell K. Propst S.M. Am. J.

To control for transfection efficiency and to correlate relative CFTR protein expression from culture to culture, triple transfections were performed with different CFTR mammalian expression vectors bearing wild-type or mutant CFTR together with green fluorescence protein- andluc-bearing mammalian expression vectors. Green fluorescence protein expression was assessed in each culture as wasluc protein expression to standardize ATP release assays in the transient transfection cultures.

Epithelial cells were seeded at high density (at least 105 cells per filter) onto collagen-coated permeable supports (Millicell). These methods have been published previously (49Jovov B.

Mean cell volume was measured in cell suspensions by electronic cell sizing (Coulter Multisizer II, AccuComp software version 1.19, Hialeah, FL) using an 100-μm aperture. Cells in subconfluent culture were harvested with minimal trypsin (0.05%), suspended in cell culture medium, centrifuged for 1 min at 1,000 × g, resuspended in 3 ml of isotonic buffer, and incubated with gentle agitation for 30–45 min. Aliquots (∼500 μl) of cell suspension were added to 20 ml of isotonic or hypotonic (40% less NaCl) buffer. Measurements of 20,000 cells on average at specified time points after exposure to isotonic or hypotonic buffer were compared with basal values in isotonic buffer (time 0). Changes in values were expressed as relative volume normalized to the basal period (5Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). SPQ (Molecular Probes) was solubilized in cell culture medium at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and was loaded into cell by an overnight incubation. The protocol was 2 min in NaI Ringer followed by 2–3 min in NaNO3 Ringer and then several minutes in NaNO3 Ringer containing forskolin or diluted by 25% with distilled water. Responses were reversed fully in NaI Ringer. Specific concerning the SPQ assay and system have been published previously (48Clancy J.P. Ruiz F.E. Sorscher E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C361-C369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly grown epithelial cells or fibroblasts (a single 35-mm dish or 12-mm diameter filter confluent and/or tight to fluid) were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. These samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR antibody as described previously (47Cheng S.H. Gregory R. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). These methods have been published previously (48Clancy J.P. Ruiz F.E. Sorscher E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C361-C369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data values were compiled into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets in which the mean ± S.E. was calculated for each time point in each set of experimental time courses. Data were then plotted in SigmaPlot for Windows using the same arbitrary light unit values. Statistics were performed using SigmaStat for Windows; paired Student's t test or unpaired ANOVA with a Bonferroni ad-hoc test were performed as appropriate. A pvalue of <0.05 was considered significant. To evaluate whether CFTR expression plays a role in cell volume regulation, cell volume recovery from swelling induced by hypotonic challenge (e.g. RVD) was assessed in cells stably expressing wild-type CFTR (WT-CFTR) versusΔF508-CFTR (Fig. 1 A). In all cells, hypotonic exposure caused an initial increase in cell volume to a similar degree that peaked at 2 min following challenge (Fig.1 A). However, expression of WT-CFTR accelerated the rate of RVD 2-fold when compared with fibroblasts devoid of CFTR (not shown) or expressing the ΔF508-CFTR mutation (Fig. 1, A andB). When expressed as percent recovery from peak swelling, expression of WT-CFTR increased the rate of volume recovery 2-fold (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results show that wild-type CFTR accelerates and potentiates cell volume regulation. To assess whether the effects of CFTR expression on cell volume regulation are related to release of ATP, the effects of the ATP scavenger apyrase were determined. In fibroblasts expressing WT-CFTR, depletion of extracellular ATP by apyrase blocked RVD completely (Fig. 1 C). Addition of ATPγS, a poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog resistant to apyrase, reversed this inhibition (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that extracellular ATP is required for RVD and for maintenance of cell volume. To determine whether these effects of CFTR on volume regulation are related to ATP release, additional studies were performed using a luciferin-luciferase assay to quantify ATP release into the medium (Fig. 2 A). Under basal conditions, WT-CFTR-expressing fibroblasts release 3-fold greater ATP than mock-transfected fibroblasts and 2-fold greater ATP than ΔF508-CFTR-expressing fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, ATP release was always detectable (above background), even in the absence of CFTR or in the presence of ΔF508-CFTR, suggesting that the ATP release mechanism is an entity separate from the ABC transporter itself. Additional studies were performed to assess the effects of transient transfection of CFTR on ATP release using COS-7 cells. Mock-transfected cells had no detectable CFTR. WT-CFTR-transfected cells expressed both partially (band B) and fully glycosylated (band C) forms of CFTR, while ΔF508-CFTR-transfected cells had only the partially glycosylated band B form of CFTR (47Cheng S.H. Gregory R. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 51Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). To more carefully monitor the amount of transduction of a given heterologous cell with CFTR, COS-7 cells were transfected transiently with two different WT-CFTR constructs or a ΔF508-CFTR constructs (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were also found in the fibroblast clones stably expressing WT-CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR (Fig. 2 B). As in the fibroblast clones studied above, wild-type CFTR potentiated ATP release 2.9 ± 0.5-fold when cultures were studied 48 h post-transfection, while ΔF508-CFTR failed to potentiate ATP release (1.2 ± 0.5-fold; mock-transfected and parental data normalized to 1-fold;n = 6–9). Taken together, these data show that wild-type CFTR potentiates ATP release from cells under basal conditions. Because WT-CFTR potentiates RVD and ATP release, we tested the hypothesis that CFTR may also potentiate ATP release triggered by an increase in cell volume after a hypotonic challenge. Hypotonic challenge to increase cell volume triggered an immediate and robust increase in ATP release from non-CF epithelia expressing WT-CFTR (Fig. 3 A). As little as 4% dilution triggered a change in luminescence of Δ+10.9 ALU from non-CF epithelia (Fig. 3 A). In sharp contrast, 33% dilution was required to stimulate any ATP release (only a Δ+0.7 ALU) from CFBE41o− monolayers. These results were confirmed by another model of CF. In CFPAC-1 monolayers lacking CFTR, a large dilution of 24% was again required to elicit a small change (only a Δ+1.6 ALU) in ATP release (Fig. 3 A). When CFPAC-1 monolayers are stably complemented with WT-CFTR, as little as 4% dilution is enough to trigger ATP release (Δ+6.8 ALU) (Fig.3 A). When challenged with more robust dilutions of the medium osmolality, 51% hypotonicity triggered a robust ATP release in WT-CFTR-expressing non-CF epithelia (Δ+48.7 ALU) and in WT-CFTR-complemented CFPAC-1 monolayers (Δ+33.0 ALU) (Fig.3 A). In contrast, 51% dilution with distilled water only stimulated small increases in luminescence in CFBE41o−monolayers (Δ+3.0 ALU) and in CFPAC-1 monolayers (Δ+3.9 ALU)) (Fig.3 A). Taken together, these results show that WT-CFTR potentiates ATP release into the apical medium and heightens the sensitivity of the apical membrane of the epithelium to hypotonic challenge and subsequent increases in cell volume. To better define CFTR protein expression in these non-CF and CF airway epithelial cell lines, immunoprecipitation of CFTR protein was performed in parallel. Expression of the mature band C form of CFTR protein was demonstrated in the non-CF 16HBE14o− cell line with a trace amount of the band B form (Fig. 3 B). In sharp contrast, the CF human airway epithelial cell line (CFBE41o−) lacked any detectable CFTR protein (Fig.3 B). Characterization of the parental CFPAC-1 cells and the stably complemented CFPAC-1 clone have been published previously (43Drumm M.L. Pope H.A. Cliff W.H. Rommens J.M. Marvin S.A. Tsui L.-C. Collins F.S. Frizzell R.A. Wilson J.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Thus, these dynamic changes in ATP release correlate with expression of CFTR protein. Because the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase signaling cascade stimulates CFTR chloride channel (51Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar) and because cyclic AMP stimulates ATP release in WT-CFTR-expressing cells (14Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.-H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 23Jiang Q. Mak D. Devidas S. Schwiebert E.M. Bragin A. Zhang Y. Skach W.R. Guggino W.B. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 143: 645-657Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that protein kinase A activity modulates hypotonicity-induced ATP release. A typical time course of the response to forskolin (2 μm) and to 33% dilution of the medium osmolality is shown in Fig.4 A. Forskolin stimulated ATP release transiently and only in fibroblasts expressing WT-CFTR (Fig.4 A). Hypotonicity stimulated ATP release in all three fibroblast clones, but most robustly in WT-CFTR-expressing fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B). More intriguingly, pretreatment with forskolin potentiated volume-sensitive ATP release, but, again, only in WT-CFTR-expressing fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B), where values increased 3-fold above those in the absence of cyclic AMP (Fig.4 B). No such enhancement was observed in mock or ΔF508-CFTR-expressing fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that cyclic AMP and hypotonicity function in a synergistic manner to stimulate ATP release, but only in cells expressing WT-CFTR. To further define whether CFTR conducts ATP or whether CFTR is closely associated with a separate ATP release channel, protein preparations containing or lacking WT-CFTR were analyzed for both Cl− and ATP− single channel conductance in planar lipid bilayers. The protein preparation used in these bilayer studies represents an epithelial cell protein extract from membrane vesicles derived from epithelial cells (49Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Benos D.J. J.

Quinton P.M. Haws C. Wine J.J. Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A. Hanrahan J.W. Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1876-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11623-11626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), CFTR immunoprecipitated and highly purified from this epithelial vesicle protein and fused with planar lipid bilayers formed channels that conducted Cl− in 18 out of 18 preparations (Cl− conductance = 11 ± 2 picosiemens) in which channels were observed. DPC (200 μm) blocked CFTR Cl− channel activity, while DIDS or gadolinium chloride (200 μm each) had no effect on CFTR Cl− channel activity (data not shown). Conversely, an ATP conductance was observed in only 1 out of 18 preparations (ATP conductance = 22 picosiemens). We hypothesized that this one example of ATP channel activity may represent the fusion and activity of a contaminating protein that conducts ATP. In support of this latter hypothesis, less pure vesicle protein preparations containing CFTR and other proteins were also examined (Fig.5 A). In this preparation, CFTR Cl− channels, outwardly rectifying Cl−channels (ORCCs), and ATP channels were observed frequently and in similar incidence (see example in Fig. 5 A). In these recordings, ATP channel activity was recorded first in symmetrical 100 mm NaATP, so as not to have possible contamination by Cl− channel activity or by trace amounts of Cl− in the recording chamber. Subsequently, ORCC and CFTR Cl− channel activity were observed when ATP-containing solutions were replaced with Cl−-containing solutions (Fig. 5 A). Addition of DIDS (300 μm) inhibited ORCCs, while DPC blocked residual CFTR Cl− channel activity (Fig. 5 A). These results show that two different Cl− conductances and an ATP conductance are present in this bovine tracheal epithelial vesicle protein material that contains CFTR. However, because highly purified CFTR does not appear to reliably conduct ATP, this ATP conductance is likely not conferred by CFTR, but may be conferred by another anion channel protein. We next asked the question: what if CFTR is removed from this material? Are CFTR Cl− channels and ATP channels lost or can this activity be dissociated? To answer these questions, CFTR was immunodepleted out of this material, and this preparation was fused with planar lipid bilayers. Importantly, an ATP conductance was still observed, even in the nominal absence of CFTR protein (Fig.5 B). In these experiments, a pressure gradient applied to the membrane increased the open probability (Po) of the ATP channel from 0.50 ± 0.10 to 0.80 ± 0.10, while GdCl3, a mechanosensitive ion channel blocker, decreased markedly the Po of ATP channels to 0.13 ± 0.05 (Fig. 5 B; n = 6). DPC and DIDS, broad specificity Cl− channel blockers, also inhibit this ATP conductance (data not shown). Taken together, the simplest interpretation of these data is that an anion channel distinct from CFTR plays a primary role in conferring the ATP conductance measured in this assay. However, the ATP conductance appears to be closely associated with CFTR. Because this channel is inhibited by gadolinium chloride and DPC and activated by a pressure gradient, this ATP-permeable channel may belong to the family of mechanosensitive anion channels. Although these data argue that CFTR itself is not likely to conduct ATP, the possibility cannot be ruled out that a regulatory cofactor required to induce CFTR to conduct ATP may be purified away from CFTR in these experiments. To provide a causal link between each of the entities described above, we tested the possibility that a mechanosensitive anion channel may be involved in conductive ATP transport out of cells and autocrine control of RVD. Focusing again on WT-CFTR-expressing fibroblasts, Fig. 6shows the effect of ion channel-blocking drugs on basal and hypotonicity-induced ATP release and on RVD dynamics. DIDS, a broad specificity Cl− channel and transporter blocking drug, was used in lieu of DPC, because DPC has inhibitory effects on the luciferase detection reagent while DIDS and GdCl3 do not (see Fig. 6 legend for data).

Some lipid A modifications are important for virulence and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. The two-component system PhoP/PhoQ plays a central role in regulating lipid A modification. We now report the discovery of a PhoP/PhoQ-activated gene (pagL) in Salmonella typhimurium, encoding a deacylase that removes the R-3-hydroxymyristate moiety attached at position 3 of certain lipid A precursors. The deacylase gene (pagL) was identified by assaying for loss of deacylase activity in extracts of 14 random TnphoA::pag insertion mutants. The pagL gene encodes a protein of 185 amino acid residues unique to S. typhimurium and closely related organisms such as Salmonella typhi. Heterologous expression of pagL in Escherichia coli on plasmid pWLP21 results in loss of the R-3-hydroxymyristate moiety at position 3 in approximately 90% of the lipid A molecules but does not inhibit cell growth. PagL is synthesized with a 20-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and is localized mainly in the outer membrane, as judged by assays of separated S. typhimurium membranes and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of membranes from E. coli cells that overexpress PagL. The function of PagL is unknown, given that S. typhimurium mutants lacking pagL display no obvious phenotypes, but PagL might nevertheless play a role in pathogenesis if it serves to modulate the cytokine response of an infected animal host."

Activation of HIV-1 gene expression is regulated by a nascent RNA structure, termed TAR RNA, in concert with HIV-1 Tat protein and these positive and negative elongation factors. We have used a stepwise RNA pol II walking approach and Western blotting to determine the dynamics of interactions between HIV-1 Tat, DSIF/NELF, and the transcription complexes actively engaged in elongation. In addition, we developed an in vitro kinase assay to determine the phosphorylation status of proteins during elongation stages. Our results demonstrate that DSIF/NELF associates with RNA pol II complexes during early transcription elongation and travels with elongation complexes as the nascent RNA is synthesized. Our results also show that HIV-1 Tat protein stimulated DSIF and RNA pol II phosphorylation by P-TEFb during elongation.

Transcription in eukaryotic cells is a complex process and involves three major steps including initiation, elongation, and termination. Although it was thought originally that regulation occurs primarily at the level of initiation, it is now recognized that the elongation step of transcription is a critical target for regulation of gene expression (1Bentley D.L.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), which are potentially regulated at the elongation stage of transcription. Shortly after initiation, RNA pol II faces a barrier of negative transcription elongation factors and enters abortive elongation. The action of positive transcription elongation factors (P-TEF) lowers the barrier of negative transcription elongation factors and helps RNA pol II to escape from this transition phase which could lead to premature termination of transcription (for an excellent review, see Ref. 8Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). A positive elongation factor, P-TEFb, allows the transition into productive elongation producing longer mRNA transcripts (8Price D.H. Mol. Cell.

DRB was discovered as an inhibitor of hnRNA and mRNA synthesis in HeLa cells (9Sehgal P.B. Darnell Jr., J.E. Tamm I.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DRB inhibits the production of full-length RNA and increases the amount of short transcripts from a variety of genes, suggesting that RNA pol II elongation was affected (10Tamm I. Kikuchi T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Salditt-Georgieff M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, DRB has no effect on promoter-independent RNA pol II transcription and on transcription reconstituted by purified general transcription factors and RNA pol II (11Chodosh L.A. Fire A.

These studies suggested that there are cellular proteins other than the RNA pol II and general transcription factors that confer DRB sensitivity on elongation. Recent studies using DRB as a transcription inhibitor led to the discovery of positive and negative elongation factors. P-TEFb was originally identified as an activity that released RNA pol II from an elongation pause in a DRB-sensitive manner (13Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol.

P-TEFb is composed of two subunits: the catalytic subunit cyclic-dependent kinase CDK9 (previously named PITALRE) and the regulatory subunit cyclin T1 (16Yang X. Gold M.O. Tang D.N. Lewis D.E.

Complexes containing CDK9 and cyclin T1-related proteins, cyclin T2a or cyclin T2b, are also active for P-TEFb activity (19Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Two negative transcription elongation factors, DSIF (DRB sensitivity-inducting factor) and NELF (negative elongation factor), have recently been identified and characterized (12Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 56-343Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 20Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). DSIF is composed of two subunits, p160 and p14, which are homologs of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors Spt5 and Spt4, respectively (12Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). NELF is composed of five polypeptides, named as NELF-A to -E, and contains a subunit identical to RD, which is a putative RNA-binding protein of unknown function. DSIF and NELF function cooperatively and strongly repress RNA pol II elongation (20Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H.

One elegant example of transcription elongation control is the mechanism of HIV-1 gene expression (for recent reviews, see Refs.22Jones K.A.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a small regulatory protein, Tat, which is required for efficient transcription of viral genes. Tat enhances the processivity of RNA pol II elongation complexes that initiate in the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region. Tat activates transcription by binding to a highly structured RNA element, TAR RNA, which is located at the 5′-end of nascent viral transcripts (27Rana T.M. Jeang K.-T. Arch. Biochem. Biophysics. 1999; 365: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Tat functions through TAR RNA to control an early step in transcription elongation that is sensitive to protein kinase inhibitors and requires the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA pol II (22Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of HIV-1 Tat protein has identified two important functional domains: an arginine-rich region that is required for binding to TAR RNA, and an activation domain that mediates the interactions with cellular machinery (28Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnadurai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3551-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3703-3711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that Tat transactivation function is mediated by a nuclear Tat-associated kinase, TAK (22Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 24Jeang K.-T.

The transactivation domain of Tat interacts with TAK (30Herrmann C. Rice A. Virology. 1993; 197: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was recently shown to be identical to the kinase subunit of P-TEFb (17Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 32Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Tat interacts with cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb and recruits the kinase complex to TAR RNA. Recruitment of P-TEFb to TAR has been proposed to be both necessary and sufficient for activation of transcription elongation from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter (33Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). P-TEFb is a component of preinitiation transcription complexes and functions by phosphorylating the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA pol II during elongation steps (34Peng J. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13855-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Ping Y.-H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Isel C. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The CTD of the largest subunit of RNA pol II contains tandem repeats of the consensus sequence (YSPTSPS) that is differentially phosphorylated during the transcription cycle and phosphorylation of the CTD is critical for transcription regulation (37Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Cellular kinases and phosphatases may contribute in transcription regulation based on their ability to alter the phosphorylation status of the RNA pol II CTD (37Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). For example, TFIIH phosphorylates the CTD of RNA pol II and assists in promoter clearance (38Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 39Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is not well understood when DSIF and NELF are recruited to the active elongation complexes and how they function. We were intrigued by the studies reporting that Spt5, one of the subunits of DSIF, is involved in Tat-mediated transactivation and functions as a positive elongation factor in HIV-1 LTR promoter in the presence of Tat (40Wu-Baer F. Lane W.S. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,41Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 598-5960Google Scholar). Since DSIF was identified as a negative elongation factor, these results suggested that there is a critical transition step which converts Spt5 from a negative to a positive elongation factor during Tat transactivation. We reasoned that DSIF could be a substrate for P-TEFb phosphorylation and the phosphorylation status of Spt5 was a key element to determine the Spt5 function in transcription. In this paper, we used a stepwise transcription approach to isolate homogeneous populations of active RNA pol II elongation complexes to study the interaction between negative elongation factors and RNA pol II transcription complex. In addition, we carried out kinase experiments during elongation to analyze the function of Spt5 in HIV-1 Tat transactivation. Our results demonstrate that DSIF and NELF associate with RNA pol II complexes during early transcription elongation and travel with elongation complexes as the nascent RNA is synthesized. Our results also show that HIV-1 Tat protein stimulated Spt5 and RNA pol II phosphorylation by P-TEFb. We propose a model for the regulation of elongation in HIV-1 LTR by Tat and Spt5. Recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography according to previously described procedures (42Rhim H. Echetebu C.O. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Acq. Immune Deficiency Syndr. 1994; 7: 21-1116Google Scholar). HIV-1 glutathioneS-transferase-Tat expression vectors were obtained from AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, which were made available by Dr. Andrew Rice. The DNA templates used for preparing transcription ternary complexes were generated by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out by using plasmid p10SLT containing HIV-1 LTR promoter as a template (43Keen N.J. Gait M.J. Karn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2505-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and three primers based on p10SLT plasmid sequence (5′-ACCAGTTGAACCAGAGC, 5′-CACACTGACTAAAAGGGT, and 5′-CACTTTATGCTTCCGGCT). The first primer contained a biotin at the 5′-end which was used to immobilize DNA to magnetic beads. Polymerase chain reaction products were purified on 1.0% agarose gels. DNA templates (0.25 μg) with biotin at 5′-end was bound to 25 μl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal Inc.) by incubating DNA and beads in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 m NaCl at room temperature overnight on a shaker. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to published procedures (44Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar, 45Wang Z. Rana T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6688-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stepwise transcriptions were performed as described previously (35Ping Y.-H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Preinitiation complexes (PICs) were assembled by incubating the immobilized DNA templates (200 ng) in a volume of 25 μl containing 12 μl of nuclear extract, 6 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg of poly(dA-dT) for 15 min at 30 °C. For RNA pol II labeling experiments at the PIC formation step, nuclear extracts were first incubated with 10 units of casein kinase II and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. Then immobilized DNA templates and poly(dA-dT) were added into the mixture with 20 μm DRB, and incubated for an additional 15 min at 30 °C. RNA pol IIO complexes at the PIC stage were formed by adding 200 μm dATP during incubation. To remove unbound materials, PICs were washed with 25 μl of washing buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6 mmMgCl2). PICs were walked to position U-14 by incubation with 12.5 mm phosphocreatine, 20 μm CTP, GTP, UTP, and dATP for 5 min at room temperature. Transcription elongation complexes (TECs) stalled at U-14 were washed with 25 μl of wash buffer B (wash buffer A containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 0.015% Sarkosyl) and twice with wash buffer C (wash buffer A containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40). The TECs were walked stepwise along the DNA templates by incubating with different combinations of NTPs. For all experiments that required additional cellular factors supplied by nuclear extract, TECs were incubated with nuclear extract at room temperature for 10 min and washed three times with wash buffer C. For chase experiments, stalled TECs were incubated with 4 NTP mixtures and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. For the isolation of ternary complexes on immobilized DNA template, the PICs and TECs stalled at different steps were cleavaged by restriction enzymes at 30 °C. The solution phase containing ternary complexes was mixed with 1 × SDS loading buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Released proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) to detect protein compositions. DSIF and NELF antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Hiroshi Handa (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan). P-TEFb and RNA pol II antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. David H. Price (University of Iowa, Iowa City) and Dr. Michael Dahmus (University of California, Davis), respectively. The anti-[HA] biotin mouse antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein contents were visualized with either ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or BM chemiluminescence Blotting Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The blots were exposed to x-ray film for various times (between 15 s and 10 min). TECs stalled at A-22 were incubated with additional nuclear extract in the absence or presence of 100 ng of HA-Tat at room temperature for 10 min. After removing the unbound proteins, TECs were chased by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm CTP, GTP, UTP, and 2 μm ATP, in the absence or presence of 20 μm DRB. To reduce nonspecific phosphorylation by other kinases such as DNA-dependent protein kinase, 50 μm inhibitor LY294002 (Sigma) was included in the chase reactions. TECs were washed three times with 25 μl of wash buffer C to remove unincorporated radioisotope and then cleaved by restriction enzyme to isolate the ternary complexes. The isolated TECs were incubated with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were pre-bound with Spt5 antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Tritone X-100, and 150 mm KCl), at 4 °C for overnight. The beads were washed with 300 μl of RIPA buffer containing 0.015% Sarkosyl three times and once with 300 μl of RIPA buffer. The bead phase was resuspended in 1 × SDS loading buffer and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled protein contents were visualized by autoradiography. The composition of TECs were also detected by immunoblotting as described above. To determine whether DSIF and NELF are present in PICs, we prepared RNA pol II complexes on immobilized DNA templates containing HIV-1 LTR. Experimental design is shown in Fig.1A. We prepared PICs containing RNA pol IIA and RNA pol IIO forms as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To visualize the formation of RNA pol IIA and RNA pol IIO forms in the presence of dATP, the largest subunit of RNA pol II was labeled by phosphorylation of the most C terminus residue (position 1928) by incubation with casein kinase II in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and this phosphorylation of RNA pol IIA did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme (46Payne J.M. Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19621-19629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,47Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase activity of TFIIH at this step was inhibited by the addition of DRB. PICs containing labeled RNA pol IIA were washed to remove excess radioisotope, DRB, and unbound proteins. RNA pol IIA was observed in the absence of dATP (Fig. 1B, lane 3) which was converted to IIO form in the presence of dATP (lane 4). These results show that PICs containing RNA pol IIA and IIO can be isolated and both forms of PICs are stable on immobilized DNA template. Next, we analyzed the composition of PICs by Western blotting. PICs containing RNA pol IIA and IIO forms were formed as described above and released from immobilized DNA templates by cleaving with restriction enzyme and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein contents were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected by Western blotting with various antibodies raised against RNA pol II, a subunit of DSIF (Spt5), a subunit of NELF (NELF-E), and a subunit of P-TEFb (CDK9). Antibodies against RNA pol II were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Dahmus (University of California, Davis). DSIF and NELF antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Hiroshi Handa (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan). P-TEFb antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. David H. Price (University of Iowa, Iowa City). Results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 1C. Regardless of the phosphorylation states of RNA pol II, DSIF and NELF are clearly not present in the PICs (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). However, P-TEFb was detected in PICs containing RNA pol IIA and IIO forms (Fig. 1C). P-TEFb as a component of PIC has been previously reported (35Ping Y.-H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and these results show that the phosphorylation status of RNA pol II did not affect the P-TEFb-PIC association. In addition, these results also indicate that there is no nonspecific interaction between DSIF, NELF, and DNA templates. To normalize the amount of transcription complexes, RNA pol II was detected as an internal standard. RNA pol IIA is converted to pol IIO form in the presence of dATP (Fig. 1B), however, we did not separate IIA and IIO bands in this gel because we were detecting RNA pol II as an internal standard and wanted to detect CDK9 in the same gel and did not run the gel for longer times to resolve proteins with high molecular weights. We were able to separate IIA and IIO when gels were run for longer times (45Wang Z. Rana T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6688-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western blotting of the nuclear extract was performed as a control experiment for the identification of the correct proteins and to confirm that these proteins are not modified or degraded in our nuclear extracts. These results indicate that DSIF and NELF do not interact with the RNA pol IIA and IIO forms in the PICs. Since DSIF and NELF are not components of the PICs (Fig. 1C), it is likely that these factors are recruited to the transcription complexes during the elongation stage. To test this hypothesis and determine the stage of elongation where DSIF and NELF interact with the transcription complex, we isolated homogeneous populations of TECs by a stepwise transcription approach (35Ping Y.-H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Preinitiation complexes were formed on immobilized DNA templates and elongation was initiated by adding dATP, UTP, CTP, and GTP. These elongation complexes were starved for ATP and therefore stalled at U-14. Further initiation was inhibited by Sarkosyl wash as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Stepwise walking of the TECs stalled at U-14 was accomplished by repeated incubation with different sets of 3 NTPs. The viability of the stalled complexes was confirmed by adding all 4 NTPs, which produced runoff products of expected lengths indicating that 100% of the complexes were transcriptionally active (data not shown). We isolated TECs at A-22 and C-61 positions which display different sequence and structure of RNA transcripts (Fig.2). TECs were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts to provide with DSIF and NELF since these factors were not present in the PICs. After removing the unbound proteins from nuclear extracts, TECs were released by cleaving the DNA template withPvuII, which is located downstream of TATA box sequence and this restriction digest avoids further initiation events. Protein contents were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using RNA pol II, DSIF, and NELF antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, DSIF and NELF can be detected in TECs after incubation with the nuclear extracts (lanes 2 and 4). As expected, there was no DSIF and NELF present in TECs without the addition of nuclear extract (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 3). Since there was no detectable binding of DSIF and NELF to the DNA templates or PICs (Fig. 1C), the associations of DSIF and NELF with TECs represent that these factors specifically interact with the elongation machinery. In agreement with our previous studies, P-TEFb was present in the elongation complexes (35Ping Y.-H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is important to note that these experiments are not quantitative, therefore, the relative stoichiometry of P-TEFb, DSIF, NELF, and RNA pol II in elongation complexes cannot be determined from these results. The intensity of various bands represents the immunoreactivity of the specific antibodies and does not correspond to the amount of proteins present in the elongation complexes. For example, DSIF bands are more intense than CDK9 and RNA pol II (Fig. 2B) and do not necessarily represent the stoichiometry of these proteins. Our results showing the coexistence of DSIF and NELF in TECs are in agreement with previous findings indicating that NELF acts cooperatively with DSIF (20Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K.

For example, it is becoming increasingly clear that vesicular trafficking of ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 plays a critical role in controlling diversity, intensity, and duration of tyrosine kinase signaling (1Di Fiore P.P.

Binding of EGF triggers the dimerization of EGFR and the activation of the tyrosine kinase at the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, which then activates downstream signal transduction pathways (3Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the ligand-receptor complexes are recruited to clathrin-coated pits and internalized. Following endocytosis, the ligand-receptor complexes are transported to early endosomes, where a sorting decision must be made between recycling back to the cell surface or delivery to lysosomes for degradation. The internalized EGF·EGFR complexes are primarily transported to lysosomes, and their degradation represents a major mechanism for attenuating EGF signaling (4Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 497-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that the internalized EGF·EGFR continues to bind and phosphorylate downstream signaling proteins in pre-degradative intracellular compartments, leading to activation of signaling pathways that are distinct from those originated at the cell surface (2Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Bergeron J.J. Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Authier F. Posner B.I. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To ensure proper temporal and spatial signaling, the endocytic and lysosomal trafficking of EGF receptors is tightly regulated. Whereas the major events in endocytosis are fairly well understood, the molecular mechanisms underlying lysosomal trafficking of these receptors remain poorly characterized.Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) was identified originally as a phosphoprotein whose tyrosine phosphorylation is induced upon stimulation by hepatocyte growth factor (6Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs is also induced by a variety of other growth factors and cytokines, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interleukin 2, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (6Komada M.

Hrs exists in cytosolic and membrane-associated forms, and appears to function in both signaling and vesicular trafficking (6Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284PubMed Google Scholar). Hrs is thought to function in cell growth signaling by cytokines via its interaction with signal transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) (7Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that Hrs also interacts with Hbp/STAM2, an STAM isoform involved in cytokine signaling and degradation of PDGF receptors (10Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Endo K. Takeshita T. Kasai H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka N. Asao H. Kikuchi K. Yamada M. Chenb M. O'Shea J.J. Sugamura K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous work has demonstrated that Hrs regulates the exocytotic fusion process via its interaction with SNAP-25, an essential component of the membrane fusion machinery (9Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W. Li Y. Chin L. Li L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284PubMed Google Scholar). Hrs shares 20% sequence identity and similar domain structure with Vps27p, a yeast protein that is required for trafficking of proteins from a prevacuolar/endosomal compartment to Golgi and vacuole, the yeast equivalent of the lysosome (8Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W.

Targeted disruption of Hrs gene in mice leads to abnormally enlarged early endosomes that are reminiscent of exaggerated “class E” compartment in yeast vps27 mutant, suggesting that Hrs may have an analogous function in vesicular trafficking through mammalian endosomes (8Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be demonstrated whether Hrs actually acts in endosome-to-Golgi and endosome-to-lysosome trafficking in mammalian cells.To understand the action of Hrs in vesicular trafficking and signaling, we performed a search for proteins that interact with Hrs using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We report here the isolation and characterization of a Hrs-interacting protein that is the rat counterpart of the human sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). SNX1 was first identified as a protein that interacts with the lysosomal targeting signal-containing cytoplasmic region of EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SNX1 accelerates degradation of EGFR, suggesting a role for SNX1 in endosome-to-lysosome trafficking (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It remains controversial as to whether SNX1 interacts only with EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) or additionally with multiple types of other cell surface receptors, including the receptors for PDGF, insulin, leptin, and transferrin (15Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SNX1 is homologous to Vps5p, a yeast protein that is required for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking (16Horazdovsky B.F. Davies B.A. Seaman M.N. McLaughlin S.A. Yoon S. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Nothwehr S.F. Hindes A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that Vps5p is a molecular component of a multimeric membrane-associated protein complex termed the retromer complex, which serves as a novel membrane coat acting in the formation of vesicles for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking (18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). It thus likely that SNX1 may function in a similar manner in mammalian cells, acting as a key component of the lysosomal sorting machinery by incorporating cargo proteins into a retromer-like membrane coat.In the present study, we demonstrate that Hrs interacts with SNX1 bothin vitro and in vivo. We define the structural requirement for this novel interaction and show that the Hrs-binding site of SNX1 overlaps with its EGFR-binding site. In addition, gel filtration analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies reveal that SNX1 and Hrs form a ∼550-kDa complex that excludes EGFR. We characterize the expression pattern and subcellular localization of SNX1 and show that it colocalizes with Hrs on early endosomes. Furthermore, we show that Hrs and SNX1 are involved in the regulation of the ligand-induced degradation of EGF receptors, but not in the internalization of these receptors. Our data suggest that Hrs may regulate lysosomal sorting and trafficking pathways via its interaction with SNX1.DISCUSSIONTrafficking of EGFR from endosome to lysosome plays a key role in attenuating EGF signaling. However, little is known at the molecular level about the mechanisms that regulate the lysosomal trafficking pathway. Previous studies have defined the lysosome-targeting signals within the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR that are responsible for the EGF-induced lysosomal degradation (42Opresko L.K. Chang C.P. Will B.H. Burke P.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4325-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 43Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The first sorting nexin, SNX1, which recognizes the EGFR lysosome-targeting signals, has recently been identified and shown to function in lysosomal trafficking of EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe a novel interaction between SNX1 and Hrs, a protein that is implicated in both vesicular trafficking and cell growth signaling. The interaction of SNX1 with Hrs was demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed byin vitro binding studies and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Deletion analysis reveals that the Hrs-SNX1 interaction involves multiple coiled-coil domains and complex folded structures of the Hrs central region (residues 225–541) and of the SNX1 COOH-terminal region (residues 300–522). Several lines of evidence support a physiological significance of the observed interaction between SNX1 and Hrs. 1) Hrs and SNX1 are ubiquitously expressed proteins that exist in both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools. 2) Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the association of Hrs and SNX occurs on cellular membranes but not in the cytosol. 3) Gel filtration analysis reveals the presence of an endogenous ∼550-kDa protein complex containing SNX1 and Hrs. 4) Subcellular fractionation studies show that SNX1 cofractionates with Hrs and early endosomal markers on an Optiprep density gradient. 5) Double immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates that Hrs and SNX1 colocalize on early endosomes. 6) Overexpression of Hrs or its SNX1-binding domain inhibits ligand-induced degradation of EGFR, but has no effect on EGFR internalization. Together, these data suggest that the interaction between SNX1 and Hrs may be involved in the regulation of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking of EGFR.Our results indicate that SNX1 and Hrs share similar properties with their yeast homologues, Vps5p and Vps27p. In yeast, both Vps5p and Vps27p are localized to the prevacuolar/endosomal compartment, although it is not known whether they colocalize with each other (17Nothwehr S.F. Hindes A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 44Piiper A. Stryjek-Kaminska D. Jahn R. Zeuzem S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, we found that Hrs and SNX1 colocalize on the early endosome, a sorting compartment where membrane proteins destined for degradation are sorted away from proteins that are recycled back to cell surface. The involvement of SNX1 and Hrs in lysosomal trafficking of EGFR is consistent with the role of Vps5p and Vps27p in yeast vesicular trafficking. Recently, it was reported that Vps5p assembles with Vps17p, Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p to form a novel coat complex called the retromer complex (18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The presence of mammalian homologues of other retromer components Vps26p, Vps29p and Vps35p suggest that SNX1 may function in a manner that is analogous to Vps5p by forming a retromer-like coat complex in mammalian cells (18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Since SNX1 directly interacts with lysosome-targeting signals on cargo proteins such as EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it is likely that SNX1 performs its sorting function by selectively recruiting specific cargo proteins into the retromer-like coat complex.The mutually exclusive interaction of Hrs and of EGFR with SNX1 indicates that the association of Hrs with SNX1 is likely to interfere with the ability of SNX1 to bind and recruit EGFR into a functional coat complex for delivery to lysosomes. Supporting this view, overexpression of Hrs or its SNX1-binding domain in HeLa cells leads to an inhibition of lysosomal trafficking of EGFR for degradation. Based upon these data, a model for the role of Hrs in lysosomal trafficking can be envisaged. Hrs, by interacting with SNX1, might serve as a regulator for the assembly of functional sorting machinery. The association of Hrs with SNX1 keeps SNX1 in an inactive state, unavailable to interact with cargo proteins and/or with other components of the retromer-like coat complex.

Future studies will test this model and determine the molecular mechanisms by which Hrs and SNX1 regulate vesicular trafficking. Vesicular trafficking, the process by which a transport vesicle buds from a donor membrane and fuses with its target, is fundamental to the function of eukaryotic cells. For example, it is becoming increasingly clear that vesicular trafficking of ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 plays a critical role in controlling diversity, intensity, and duration of tyrosine kinase signaling (1Di Fiore P.P. Gill G.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Binding of EGF triggers the dimerization of EGFR and the activation of the tyrosine kinase at the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, which then activates downstream signal transduction pathways (3Schlessinger J.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Endo K. Takeshita T. Kasai H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka N. Asao H. Kikuchi K. Yamada M. Chenb M. O'Shea J.J. Sugamura K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous work has demonstrated that Hrs regulates the exocytotic fusion process via its interaction with SNAP-25, an essential component of the membrane fusion machinery (9Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W. Li Y. Chin L. Li L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284PubMed Google Scholar). Hrs shares 20% sequence identity and similar domain structure with Vps27p, a yeast protein that is required for trafficking of proteins from a prevacuolar/endosomal compartment to Golgi and vacuole, the yeast equivalent of the lysosome (8Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W.

Targeted disruption of Hrs gene in mice leads to abnormally enlarged early endosomes that are reminiscent of exaggerated “class E” compartment in yeast vps27 mutant, suggesting that Hrs may have an analogous function in vesicular trafficking through mammalian endosomes (8Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be demonstrated whether Hrs actually acts in endosome-to-Golgi and endosome-to-lysosome trafficking in mammalian cells. To understand the action of Hrs in vesicular trafficking and signaling, we performed a search for proteins that interact with Hrs using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We report here the isolation and characterization of a Hrs-interacting protein that is the rat counterpart of the human sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). SNX1 was first identified as a protein that interacts with the lysosomal targeting signal-containing cytoplasmic region of EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SNX1 accelerates degradation of EGFR, suggesting a role for SNX1 in endosome-to-lysosome trafficking (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It remains controversial as to whether SNX1 interacts only with EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) or additionally with multiple types of other cell surface receptors, including the receptors for PDGF, insulin, leptin, and transferrin (15Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SNX1 is homologous to Vps5p, a yeast protein that is required for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking (16Horazdovsky B.F. Davies B.A. Seaman M.N. McLaughlin S.A. Yoon S. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Nothwehr S.F. Hindes A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that Vps5p is a molecular component of a multimeric membrane-associated protein complex termed the retromer complex, which serves as a novel membrane coat acting in the formation of vesicles for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking (18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). It thus likely that SNX1 may function in a similar manner in mammalian cells, acting as a key component of the lysosomal sorting machinery by incorporating cargo proteins into a retromer-like membrane coat. In the present study, we demonstrate that Hrs interacts with SNX1 bothin vitro and in vivo. We define the structural requirement for this novel interaction and show that the Hrs-binding site of SNX1 overlaps with its EGFR-binding site. In addition, gel filtration analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies reveal that SNX1 and Hrs form a ∼550-kDa complex that excludes EGFR. We characterize the expression pattern and subcellular localization of SNX1 and show that it colocalizes with Hrs on early endosomes. Furthermore, we show that Hrs and SNX1 are involved in the regulation of the ligand-induced degradation of EGF receptors, but not in the internalization of these receptors. Our data suggest that Hrs may regulate lysosomal sorting and trafficking pathways via its interaction with SNX1. DISCUSSIONTrafficking of EGFR from endosome to lysosome plays a key role in attenuating EGF signaling. However, little is known at the molecular level about the mechanisms that regulate the lysosomal trafficking pathway. Previous studies have defined the lysosome-targeting signals within the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR that are responsible for the EGF-induced lysosomal degradation (42Opresko L.K. Chang C.P. Will B.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The first sorting nexin, SNX1, which recognizes the EGFR lysosome-targeting signals, has recently been identified and shown to function in lysosomal trafficking of EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe a novel interaction between SNX1 and Hrs, a protein that is implicated in both vesicular trafficking and cell growth signaling. The interaction of SNX1 with Hrs was demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed byin vitro binding studies and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Deletion analysis reveals that the Hrs-SNX1 interaction involves multiple coiled-coil domains and complex folded structures of the Hrs central region (residues 225–541) and of the SNX1 COOH-terminal region (residues 300–522). Several lines of evidence support a physiological significance of the observed interaction between SNX1 and Hrs. 1) Hrs and SNX1 are ubiquitously expressed proteins that exist in both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools. 2) Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the association of Hrs and SNX occurs on cellular membranes but not in the cytosol. 3) Gel filtration analysis reveals the presence of an endogenous ∼550-kDa protein complex containing SNX1 and Hrs. 4) Subcellular fractionation studies show that SNX1 cofractionates with Hrs and early endosomal markers on an Optiprep density gradient. 5) Double immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates that Hrs and SNX1 colocalize on early endosomes. 6) Overexpression of Hrs or its SNX1-binding domain inhibits ligand-induced degradation of EGFR, but has no effect on EGFR internalization. Together, these data suggest that the interaction between SNX1 and Hrs may be involved in the regulation of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking of EGFR.Our results indicate that SNX1 and Hrs share similar properties with their yeast homologues, Vps5p and Vps27p. In yeast, both Vps5p and Vps27p are localized to the prevacuolar/endosomal compartment, although it is not known whether they colocalize with each other (17Nothwehr S.F. Hindes A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 44Piiper A. Stryjek-Kaminska D. Jahn R. Zeuzem S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, we found that Hrs and SNX1 colocalize on the early endosome, a sorting compartment where membrane proteins destined for degradation are sorted away from proteins that are recycled back to cell surface. The involvement of SNX1 and Hrs in lysosomal trafficking of EGFR is consistent with the role of Vps5p and Vps27p in yeast vesicular trafficking. Recently, it was reported that Vps5p assembles with Vps17p, Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p to form a novel coat complex called the retromer complex (18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The presence of mammalian homologues of other retromer components Vps26p, Vps29p and Vps35p suggest that SNX1 may function in a manner that is analogous to Vps5p by forming a retromer-like coat complex in mammalian cells (18Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Since SNX1 directly interacts with lysosome-targeting signals on cargo proteins such as EGFR (14Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it is likely that SNX1 performs its sorting function by selectively recruiting specific cargo proteins into the retromer-like coat complex.The mutually exclusive interaction of Hrs and of EGFR with SNX1 indicates that the association of Hrs with SNX1 is likely to interfere with the ability of SNX1 to bind and recruit EGFR into a functional coat complex for delivery to lysosomes. Supporting this view, overexpression of Hrs or its SNX1-binding domain in HeLa cells leads to an inhibition of lysosomal trafficking of EGFR for degradation. Based upon these data, a model for the role of Hrs in lysosomal trafficking can be envisaged. Hrs, by interacting with SNX1, might serve as a regulator for the assembly of functional sorting machinery. The association of Hrs with SNX1 keeps SNX1 in an inactive state, unavailable to interact with cargo proteins and/or with other components of the retromer-like coat complex.

https://openalex.org/W1967432418,"Deletion of YFH1, the yeast frataxin homologue gene, elicits mitochondrial iron accumulation and alters cellular iron homeostasis. Here, we report a genome wide analysis of gene expression in a yfh1(ΔYFH1) deleted strain. Frataxin deficiency results in enhanced expression of some 70 genes including a set of genes, called the iron regulon, that are under the control of the iron-sensing transcription factor AFT1. Five newAFT1-dependent genes, YOR382w,YOR383c, YDR534c, YLR136c, andYLR205c were found. The first three genes presumably encode cell-wall glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor proteins and exhibit a 30–100-fold increased expression. The triple deletion of these genes decreases efficiency in utilization of the iron of ferrioxamine B by the yeast cell. YLR136c bears homology to tristetraproline proteins, which are post-transcriptional regulators in mammalian cells. Deletion of YLR136c increases the mRNA levels of iron regulon members. YLR205c bears homology to heme oxygenases. Our data show that frataxin deficiency elicits iron mobilization from all iron sources in an AFT1-dependent manner. Wild-type and ΔYFH1 glycerol-grown cells exhibit similar high respiration rates, no mitochondrial iron accumulation, and high expression of the iron regulon, suggesting that under these conditions little iron is extruded from mitochondria. These data suggest that the activity of Yfh1p is not essential in cells grown on glycerol. This study has also revealed unexpected links between mitochondria and remote metabolic pathways since frataxin deficiency also enhances the expression of genes such as HSP30, that escape toAFT1 control. Finally, no oxidative stress gene is induced."

The tectosphere is thought to be depleted in its basaltic components and to have an intrinsic buoyancy that balances the mass increase associated with its colder temperature relative to suboceanic mantle. Inversions of a large set of geodynamic data related to mantle convection, using tomography-based mantle flow models, indicate that the tectosphere is chemically depleted and relatively cold to 250 kilometers depth below Earth's surface.

Expression of p40 mRNA but not that of p35 mRNA in excessive amount in the central nervous system of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that IL-12 p40 may have a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the mode of action of p40 is completely unknown. Because nitric oxide produced from the induction of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) also plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of MS, the present study was undertaken to explore the role of p40 in the induction of NO production and the expression of iNOS in microglia. Both IL-12 and p402, the p40 homodimer, dose-dependently induced the production of NO in BV-2 microglial cells. This induction of NO production was accompanied by an induction of iNOS protein and mRNA. Induction of NO production by the expression of mouse p40 cDNA but not that of the mouse p35 cDNA suggests that the p40 but not the p35 subunit of IL-12 is involved in the expression of iNOS.

J. 2000; 14: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Subsequently, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for iNOS mRNA in MS brains also shows markedly higher expression of iNOS mRNA in MS brains than in normal brains (12Brosan C.F.

Hanley D. Trapp B.D. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar).On the other hand, interleukin-12 (IL-12) plays a critical role in the early inflammatory response to infection and in the generation of T helper type 1 Th-1 cells, which favor cell-mediated immunity (14Hsieh C.S. Macatonia S.E. Tripp C.S. Wolf S.F. O'Garra A. Murphy K.M. Science. 1993; 260: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (2861) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found that overproduction of IL-12 can be dangerous to the host as it is involved in the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune inflammatory diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes, Refs. 15Constantinescu C.S. Goodman D.B. Hilliard B. Wysocka M. Cohen J.A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 287: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,16Zipris D. Greiner D.L. Malkani S. Whalen B. Mordes J.P. Rossini A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1315-1321PubMed Google Scholar). IL-12 consists of a heavy chain (p40) and a light chain (p35) linked covalently by disulfide bonds to give rise to a heterodimeric (p70) molecule (17Wolf S.F. Temple P.A. Kobayashi M. Young D. Dicig M. Lowe L. Dzialo R. Fitz L. Ferenz C. Hewick R.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3074-3081PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schoenhaut D.S. Chua A.O. et al.J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3433-3440PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the heterodimeric p70 molecule is the bioactive IL-12 cytokine, and both subunits must be coexpressed in the same cell to generate the bioactive form (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). However, the level of p40 is much higher than that of p35 in IL-12 producing cells (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Again, several reports (15Constantinescu C.S. Goodman D.B. Hilliard B. Wysocka M. Cohen J.A. Neurosci.

Neurology. 1998; 51: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicate that the level of p40 mRNA in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with MS is much higher than the CNS of control subjects whereas the level of p35 mRNA is about the same or decreases compared with controls. Similarly, in mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, the expression of p40 mRNA but not that of p35 mRNA increases in brain and spinal cord (22Bright J.J. Musuro B.F. Du C. Sriram S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 82: 22-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of marked overexpression of IL-12 p40 subunit in neural tissues of MS patients and EAE animals has not been delineated so far.We herein report the first evidence that p402, the IL-12 p40 homodimer, markedly induces the production of NO and the expression of iNOS through the activation of NF-κB in mouse microglia.DISCUSSIONIL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine, is most noted for its ability to regulate the balance between type 1 and type 2 helper T cells (14Hsieh C.S.

Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Neither IL-12 subunits (p35 or p40) alone was found to display significant biological activity over a large range of concentrations (17Wolf S.F. Temple P.A. Kobayashi M. Young D. Dicig M. Lowe L. Dzialo R. Fitz L. Ferenz C. Hewick R.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3074-3081PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schoenhaut D.S. Chua A.O. et al.J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3433-3440PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gately M.K.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that p40 is expressed in excessive amount in the CNS of different demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Guillain-Barre syndrome, and animal models experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and neuritis (15Constantinescu C.S. Goodman D.B. Hilliard B. Wysocka M. Cohen J.A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 287: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Zipris D. Greiner D.L. Malkani S. Whalen B. Mordes J.P. Rossini A.A. J.

Neurology. 1998; 51: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of p35 remains almost constant or decreased to some extent in the CNS of these demyelinating diseases compared with the CNS of control subjects (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 20van Boxel-Dezaire A.H. Hoff S.C. et al.Ann.

Neurology. 1998; 51: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of this overexpression of p40 in the CNS of patients with demyelinating diseases is not known.Several lines of evidence presented in this manuscript clearly support the conclusion that IL-12 p40 homodimer, p402, induces the expression of iNOS in mouse microglia and macrophages. This conclusion was based on the following observations. First, p402induces the production of NO, which is inhibited by arginase, the enzyme which degrades the substrate of NOS, and by l-NMA, an inhibitor of NOS. Second, p402-mediated production of NO and expression of iNOS is inhibited by anti-mouse p40 but not by anti-mouse p70. Third, the expression of mouse p40 cDNA but not the mouse p35 cDNA induces the production of NO and the expression of iNOS, suggesting that the p40 but not the p35 subunit of IL-12 is involved in the induction of iNOS. Because NO produced from the activation of iNOS in the CNS participates in the pathophysiology of MS (4Bo L. Dawson T.M. Wesselingh S. Mork S. Choi S. Kong P.A. Hanley D. Trapp B.D. Ann.

Neurology. 1998; 51: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the induction of iNOS by p40 suggest that p40 may participate in the pathophysiology of MS through the induction of iNOS.The level of p40 is much higher (5- to 500-fold) than that of the heterodimeric p70 in IL-12-producing cells (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). This excess p40 produced either in vitro in activated cells or in vivo in serum of endotoxin-treated mice exists as both dimer (20–40%) and monomer (the remainder, Ref. 19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Although the biological role of the monomeric as well as the dimeric form of p40 is not known, it has been suggested that p402 may act as a physiologic regulator of bioactive IL-12, because p402possesses IL-12 antagonist activity (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 39Germann T. Rude E. Mattner F. Gately M.K. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 500-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the induction of iNOS by p402 suggests that p402 exhibits IL-12 antagonist activity possibly through the activation of iNOS. However, our observation that both p402 and the so-called bioactive IL-12 (heterodimeric p70) induce the production of NO and the expression of iNOS precludes this possibility. If iNOS-derived NO mediates the IL-12 antagonist activity of p402 then IL-12 itself can regulate its own function through the activation of iNOS. Apart from the IL-12 antagonist activity of p40, experiments onListeria monocytogenes infection in p40- and p35-deficient mice have shown that p40-deficient mice were susceptible to infection, but p35-deficient mice were able to eliminate bacteria despite the mouse's inability to produce biologically active heterodimeric IL-12 (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has also been found that the p35-deficient mouse produces normal levels of p40 (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that p40 alone may carry out some of the biological functions of heterodimeric IL-12. Here we present the first evidence that similar to IL-12, p402 can also induce the expression of iNOS and that iNOS-derived NO may account for the bacteria-eliminating property of both IL-12 and p40.The signaling events in cytokine-mediated induction of iNOS are not completely established so far. Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, or IFN-γ) bind to their respective receptors and induce the expression of iNOS via NF-κB activation (26Pahan K. Liu X. Wood C. Raymond J.R.

Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the inhibition of iNOS expression with the inhibition of NF-κB activation establishes an essential role of NF-κB activation in the induction of iNOS (26Pahan K.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by various cellular stimuli involves the proteolytic degradation of IkB, the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB complex, and the concomitant nuclear translocation of the liberated NF-κB heterodimer (40Stefanova I. Corcoran M.L. Horak E.M. Wahl L.M. Bolen J.B. Horak I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20725-20728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Salkowski C.A. Detore G. McNally R. van Rooijen N. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 905-912PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biochemical mechanism underlying the degradation of IkB remains unclear, it appears that degradation of IkB induced by various mitogens and cytokines occurs in association with the transient phosphorylation of IkB on serines 32 and 36 (42). Consistently, two closely related kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) that directly phosphorylate IkBα have also been described (43DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar, 44Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 45Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. et al.Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, IkB that is still bound to NF-κB apparently becomes a high affinity substrate for an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (46Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation-controlled ubiquitination, the IkB is rapidly and completely degraded by the 20 S or 26 S proteosome, and the NF-κB heterodimer enters into the nucleus (47Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) and binds to the consensus DNA-binding site present in the promoter region of iNOS.Our results have clearly shown that p402 induces the expression of iNOS through the activation of NF-κB. First, p402 induces the DNA-binding as well as the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Second, expression of the mouse p40 cDNA but not the mouse p35 cDNA induces the activation of NF-κB and the expression of iNOS. Third, SN50, a cell-permeable peptide carrying the nuclear localization sequence of p50 NF-κB, but not mutant SN50 (SN50M) inhibits p402-mediated activation of NF-κB and expression of iNOS. It has been demonstrated that SN50 specifically blocks the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, but does not affect the activity of AP-1, SP-1 factor, and OCT-1 transcriptional factors (48Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Nakai M. Chase T.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) suggesting that SN50 inhibits the expression of iNOS in p402-stimulated microglial cells by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB. In addition, these results also suggest that IL-12 p402 is biologically active and that p402alone can activate microglial cells.At present, it is unclear how p402 activates NF-κB and induces iNOS in microglial cells. IL-12 p402 has been shown to antagonize bioactive IL-12 heterodimer by binding to the IL-12 receptor complex (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The high affinity IL-12 receptor is composed of a low affinity IL-12Rβ1 combined with a low affinity IL-12Rβ2, which are responsible for Tyk2/Jak2 activation, respectively, and STAT4 activation (19Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 49Wang X. Wilkinson V.L. Podlaski F.J. Wu C. Stern A.S. Presky D.H. Magram J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2007-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It appears that p402 binds to IL-12Rβ1 rather than IL-12Rβ2, whereas bioactive IL-12 binds the receptor complex with high affinity (50Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that p402 activates NF-κB and induces the expression of iNOS through the IL-12Rβ1.NO, a diffusible free radical, plays many roles as a signaling and as a effector molecule in diverse biological systems including neuronal messenger, vasodilation, and antimicrobial and antitumor activities (51Nathan C. FASEB. J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar, 52Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the nervous system the NO appears to have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects and may have a role in the pathogenesis of stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases and in demyelinating conditions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalopathy, X-adrenoleukodystrophy) associated with infiltrating macrophages and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (53Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.T. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6368-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). NO and peroxynitrite (reaction product of NO and O 2−) are potentially toxic molecules to neurons and oligodendrocytes that may mediate toxicity through the formation of iron-NO complexes of iron containing enzyme systems (54Drapier J-C. Hibbs J.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2829-2838PubMed Google Scholar), oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups (55Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Kasprazak K.S. et al.Science. 1991; 254: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Although monocytes/macrophages are the primary source of iNOS in inflammation, LPS and proinflammatory cytokines induce a similar response in microglia (35Suzumura A. Sawada M. Takayanagi T.

However, controversy exists as to the number and properties of the methyltransferases involved. Using primers designed on the basis of conserved amino acid regions of tea caffeine synthase andArabidopsis hypothetical proteins, a particular DNA fragment was amplified from an mRNA population of coffee plants. Subsequently, this fragment was used as a probe, and four independent clones were isolated from a cDNA library derived from coffee young leaves. Upon expression in Escherichia coli, one of them was found to encode a protein possessing 7-methylxanthine methyltransferase activity and was designated as CaMXMT. It consists of 378 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 42.7 kDa and shows similarity to tea caffeine synthase (35.8%) and salicylic acid methyltransferase (34.1%). The bacterially expressed protein exhibited an optimal pH for activity ranging between 7 and 9 and methylated almost exclusively 7-methylxanthine with low activity toward paraxanthine, indicating a strict substrate specificity regarding the 3-N position of the purine ring. K mvalues were estimated to be 50 and 12 μm for 7-methylxanthine and S-adenosyl-l-methionine, respectively. Transcripts of CaMXMT could be shown to accumulate in young leaves and stems containing buds, and green fluorescent protein fusion protein assays indicated localization in cytoplasmic fractions.

Their physiological roles are considered to be chemical defense against invertebrate herbivores. Caffeine, a typical purine alkaloid, is found in seeds and leaves of coffee (Coffea arabica), cola (Cola nitida), maté (Ilex paraguariensis), and tea (Camellia sinensis) at concentrations up to 1 mg/1 g, dry weight (1Roberts M.F. Wink M. Alkaloids: Biochemistry, Ecology, and Medical Applications. Plenum Press, New York1998: 11Crossref Google Scholar, 2Baumann T.W. Koetz R. Morath P. Plant Cell Rep. 1983; 2: 33-35PubMed Google Scholar). It exhibits a lethal effect on tobacco horn worm (Manduca sexta) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity, which hydrolyzes cAMP (3Croteau R. Kutchan T.M. Lews N.G. Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD2000: 1250-1318Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathway of caffeine has been intensively studied, and it is now established that it is successively synthesized from adenine nucleotides through multiple steps catalyzed by several enzymes (4Ashihara H. Kato M. Chuang-xing Y. J. Plant Res. 1998; 111: 599-604Crossref Google Scholar, 5Ashihara H. Monteiro A.M. Gillies F.M. Crozier A.

The final series of steps involves methylation of xanthosine byN-methyltransferase, yielding 7-methylxanthosine, whose ribose residue is removed by 7-methylxanthosine nucleosidase. The resulting 7-methylxanthine (7mX)1 is methylated at the 3-N-position by N-methyltransferase, producing 3,7-dimethylxanthine (theobromine), which is again methylated at the 1-N-position to give 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine (caffeine) (Fig. 1). All reactions requireS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor. Some bypass pathways, for example featuring paraxanthine, have also been suggested, but in coffee and tea plants, it was confirmed that the major pathway is through theobromine (5Ashihara H. Monteiro A.M. Gillies F.M. Crozier A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Ashihara H. Crozier A. Adv. Bot. Res. 1999; 30: 117-205Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At least three N-methyltransferases are considered to contribute to this pathway; these catalyze methylation of xanthosine (the first), methylation of 7mX (the second), and methylation of theobromine (the third). Their isolation and characterization have attracted a good deal of attention, and enzymes catalyzing the second and the third steps were first identified in crude extract of tea leaves (7Suzuki T. Takahashi E. Biochem. J. 1975; 146: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since then a dozen surveys describing their purification and characterization in coffee and tea plants have been published (2Baumann T.W. Koetz R. Morath P.

Phytochemistry. 1997; 44: 853-859Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, it was found that the enzymes are extremely labile, making it difficult even to distinguish each activity. Indeed, it is not clear yet whether the activities are catalyzed by independent or multifunctional proteins (2Baumann T.W. Koetz R. Morath P. Plant Cell Rep. 1983; 2: 33-35PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mosli Waldhauser S.S. Gillies F.M. Crozier A. Baumann T.W. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite such difficulties, a caffeine synthase (CS) was recently isolated successfully from tea leaves (14Kato M. Mizuno K. Fujimura T. Iwama M. Irie M. Crozier A. Ashihara H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The enzyme has a native molecular mass of 61 kDa and exhibits 3- and 1-N-methyltransferase activities toward substrates such as 7mX, theobromine, and paraxanthine (14Kato M. Mizuno K. Fujimura T. Iwama M. Irie M. Crozier A. Ashihara H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It was thus concluded that, at least in tea leaves, a single enzyme has dual functions in caffeine synthesis. Subsequently, the gene encoding this CS was isolated (TCS1), and the predicted amino acid sequence was found to show considerable similarity with salicylic acidO-methyltransferase (15Kato M. Mizuno K. Crozier A. Fujimura T. Ashihara H. Nature. 2000; 406: 956-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Whether or not a similar enzyme(s) functions in coffee plants has not been hitherto determined. Although a coffee gene encoding xanthosine methyltransferase (XMT), was reported in a patent (16Stiles, J. I., and Moisyadi, I. (February 10, 1997) International Patent WO 97/35960.Google Scholar), the details remain to be clarified. In this work, we document isolation of a gene encoding an enzyme that catalyzes methylation of 7mX from coffee plants. In contrast to tea CS, the enzyme features strict substrate specificity toward methylation only at the 3-N-position of the purine ring. It is suggested that, in coffee plants, caffeine synthesis is mediated by three methylation steps catalyzed by distinct enzymes, including the presently identified 7mX methyltransferase. Coffee plants (C. arabica L. var. caturra) were cultivated in a greenhouse. Two degenerated oligonucleotides, 5′-GGITGYDSIDSIGGICCIAAYAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ARIYKIYYRTRRAAISWICCIGG-3′ (reverse), which correspond to the amino acid sequences of GC(A/S)(A/S)GPNT and PGSF(H/Y)(G/K)(R/N)LF, respectively, were synthesized based on conserved regions among TCS1 (Ref. 15Kato M. Mizuno K. Crozier A. Fujimura T. Ashihara H. Nature. 2000; 406: 956-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; accession number AB031280) and two Arabidopsishypothetical proteins (Z99708 and AC008153). PCR was performed in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing C. arabica cDNA and the pair of primers mentioned above under the conditions of 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. A 255-base pair fragment was amplified, and one of the deduced amino acid sequences from its DNA sequence showed 34% identity to that of TCS1. This fragment was used to screen the C. arabica cDNA library. Total RNA was extracted by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method (17Hatanaka T. Choi Y.E. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Cell Rep. 1999; 19: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with a slight modification, and poly(A+) RNA was purified using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and converted into double-stranded cDNA using a ZAPII cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNA was ligated with Uni-ZAP XR vector arms and packaged using a Gigapack III kit. The titer of the library was 3 × 107 plaque-forming units. The open reading frame regions of clones 1, 6, 35, and 45 sandwiched with SmaI and NotI restriction sites were subcloned into the pGEX 4T-2 vector (PharmaciaPhandEscherichia coli JM109 cells were transformed with the resulting plasmids. When the A 600 of theE. coli cell culture reached 0.5, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactoside was added for production of GST fusion proteins followed by further incubation at 18 °C for 6 h. The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a sonication buffer, and disrupted by a sonicator. Fusion proteins were purified from the clear lysates as described earlier (18Ikeda Y. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was determined by an established procedure (14Kato M. Mizuno K. Fujimura T. Iwama M. Irie M. Crozier A. Ashihara H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The reaction mixture of 100 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 200 μm substrate, 4 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (2.15 GBq/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 200 μmMgCl2, and 200 ng of purified recombinant protein was incubated at 27 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform, and the organic phase was recovered, dried at 60 °C, and dissolved in 10 μl of 50% methanol. This fraction was separated by thin layer (Silica gel 60 F254; Merck) chromatography with a solution of H2O/acetic acid/n-butyl alcohol (2:1:4, v/v/v). Radioactive images were detected with an image analyzer (Fuji BAS2000). Data from at least three replicate experiments in each case were pooled and analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression fitting to the Hill equation (Equation 1) with the Anemona program (19Hernandez A. Ruiz M.T. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). v=Vmax[S]h/(K+[S]h)Equation 1 where v is the rate of reaction (rate of product formation), Vmax is maximum rate, Kis the rate constant, [S] is the substrate concentration, andh is the Hill number. A reaction mixture of 100 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 μm substrate, 50 μm AdoMet, 200 μm MgCl2, and 200 ng of purified GST fusion protein was incubated at 27 °C for 2 h and extracted with 1 ml of chloroform. The chloroform phase was dried, resolved in 12% acetonitrile, and separated by HPLC using a column (Shodex Rspak DS-613, Showa Denko) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min of 12% acetonitrile and then monitored for absorbance at 254 nm. Total RNAs were isolated from various C. arabica tissues and reverse-transcribed by SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first-strand cDNAs were used as a template for reverse transcription-PCR analysis, performed as follows: 96 °C for 20 s; 30 cycles of 96 °C for 20 s, 60 °C (55 °C in case of XMT) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; followed by further extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The primers used were CaMXMT-Fw (5′-CCAGTAAGATCCCATGAACAAAT-3′), CaMXMT-RV (5′-TTATTACGAATACAAAACGACAATACC-3′), XMT-Fw (5′-AGCACATTCGGACTCTCCAG-3′), XMT-RV (5′-TACCGAGTTAAGCGATGCAC-3′), CaMTL1/2-Fw (5′-CCATTCCCCAGAATACAGCG-3′), CaMTL1/2-RV (5′-CCCCGTATCAGAAAACAAACC-3′), CaMTL3-Fw (5′-GGCTTCTCTATTGACGATGAACATAT-3′), and CaMTL3-RV (5′-CACTTATTCCTTTCCCCAACAC-3′). The CaMXMT-entire coding region fragments sandwiched with XbaI and KpnI sites were subcloned into pGFP2 (provided by Drs. Chua and Spielhofer), resulting in pCaMXMT::GFP. Thin sections of onion bulbs cut into 9-cm2 squares were biolistically bombarded as described (20Hara K. Yagi M. Kusano T. Sano H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), with gold particles (Bio-Rad) coated with the plasmids pGFP2, pCaMXMT::GFP. After bombardment, they were incubated for 12 h at 25 °C in darkness and then viewed using epifluorescence microscopy (20Hara K. Yagi M. Kusano T. Sano H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise described.S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (2.15 GBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To isolate genes for caffeine synthase of coffee plants, a 255-base pair fragment amplified by PCR with degenerated primers was used for screening a phage library. A total of 35 randomly selected plaques hybridized to the probe were converted into phagemids. They were classified into four groups by physical mapping and by partial DNA sequencing. The longest cDNAs of each group, clones 1, 6, 35, and 45 were selected, their DNA sequences were determined, and the deduced products were aligned (Fig.2). Pairwise identities between clone 45 product and those of clones 1, 6, and 35 were 80.8, 81.3, and 84.7%, respectively. Clones 1 and 6 showed 95.8% identity with each other. The GST fusion proteins of clones 6, 35, and 45 were produced in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Fig.3 A), andN-methyltransferase activity was assayed. The product of clone 45 catalyzed conversion of 7mX to theobromine and that of paraxanthine to caffeine (Fig. 3 B). Identification of the product as theobromine was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (Fig. 3 C). The protein catalyzes methylation either of 7mX or of paraxanthine at the 3-N-position and has a 5-fold preference for 7mX as opposed to paraxanthine as the substrate (Table I). Substrate specificity of the clone 45 product is distinct from that of tea CS, which prefers paraxanthine to 7mX (14Kato M. Mizuno K. Fujimura T. Iwama M. Irie M. Crozier A. Ashihara H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cDNA of clone 45 was, therefore, designated as CaMXMT (C. arabica7-methylxanthine methyltransferase). The deduced amino acid sequence showed identity to TCS1 of 35.8%, to salicylic acid methyltransferase of 34.1%, and to benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase of 34.2% (Fig. 4). Although the products of clones 1, 6, and 35 showed high similarity to CaMXMT, they had no methyltransferase activity for the substrates tested (data not shown). These clones were designated asCaMTL1 (C.a rabicamethyltransferase-like 1, clone 1),CaMTL2 (clone 6), and CaMTL3 (clone 35), respectively.Table ISubstrate specificity of CaMXMTMaterialSubstrateSources7mX3mX1mXTbTpPxXXRXMPRecombinant CaMXMT (coffee)100NDNDNDND15NDNDNDThis studyCrude enzyme (coffee fruits)1005.71274.6175NDNDRef.8Roberts M.F.

The optimal pH for 7mX methyltransferase activity of CaMXMT ranged between 7 and 9, with the peak at 7.5 (Fig. 5 A). The effects of 7mX and AdoMet concentrations on the reaction velocity of GST-CaMXMT protein were determined (Fig. 5 B). TheK m values for 7mX and AdoMet were 50 and 11.9 μm, respectively, and apparentVmax values were estimated to be 7.14 and 7.94 pmol of theobromine/min/μg of protein upon measurement with the variable amounts of 7mX and AdoMet, respectively. Accumulation of CaMXMTtranscripts was estimated by reverse transcription-PCR together withCaMTL1, CaMTL2, and CaMT3 in various tissues including roots, stems containing buds, old leaves, and young leaves of C. arabica (Fig.6 A). The level of transcripts for XMT, which catalyzes the conversion of xanthosine to 7-methylxanthosine, was also tested. Transcripts of CaMXMTwere detected in stems and young leaves but not in roots and old leaves, similar to the expression pattern for XMT. Transcripts of CaMTL1 and CaMTL2 were present in all tissues at high levels, whereas CaMTL3 transcripts were abundant in stems and young leaves and also in roots and old leaves at a lower level. To identify the cellular localization of CaMXMT, the cDNA fragment covering the entire coding region of CaMXMT was fused to pGFP2, and the resulting plasmid was introduced into the onion epidermal layer by a biolistic bombardment. Green fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6 B). This report documents isolation of a gene encoding 7mX methyltransferase from coffee plants and characterization of the bacterially expressed recombinant enzyme. Screening a coffee cDNA library with a probe constructed from a conserved amino acid region of TCS1 and similar sequences derived from Arabidopsisexpressed sequence tag clones, four distinct cDNA clones were isolated. The protein encoded by one of them showed 7mX methyltransferase activity when expressed as a fusion protein with GST in E. coli and was designated as CaMXMT. Proteins encoded by other clones (CaMTL1, -2, and -3) did not show any methyltransferase activity on substrates examined for CaMXMT. The deduced amino acid sequence of CaMXMT showed rather low similarity to TCS1 (35.8%) and high similarity to CaMTLs (more than 80%) (Fig. 4 B). This result indicates CaMXMT is not close in an evolutionary sense to TCS1. In other words, caffeine biosynthetic pathway in coffee and tea might have evolved independently, consistent with different catalytic properties of the enzymes involved (see below). CaMXMT also showed low similarity to salicylic acidO-methytransferase from Clarkia breweri (21Ross J.R. Nam K.H. Dı́Auria J.C. Pichersky E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and bezoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase isolated from snapdragon (Antirrhinum sp.) flowers (22Dudareva N. Murfitt L.M. Mann C.J. Gorestein N. Kolosava N. Kish C.M. Bonham C. Wood K. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, we found several related sequences in the expressed sequence tag ofArabidopsis. Although more than 120 methyltransferases have so far been reported from various organisms (23Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structure and Functions. World Scientific, Singapore1999: 3Google Scholar), methyltransferases of this type are not well characterized. Their structures appear to be unique, with little similarities to other methyltransferases, suggesting a new class. However, it has been pointed out that salicylic acid methyltransferase contains domains similar to motifs I and III found in plant O-methyltransferases (21Ross J.R. Nam K.H. Dı́Auria J.C. Pichersky E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Those are proposed to be involved in AdoMet binding and conserved in salicylic acid methyltransferase, benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, TCS, and CaMXMT (Fig. 4 A), although TCS1 and CaMXMT areN-methyltransferases. The motifs are also found in CaMTLs, making it highly probable that they possess methyltransferase activity, although they do not participate in caffeine biosynthesis. The major difference in amino acid sequence between CaMXMT and CaMTLs is Val159-His160-Tyr161 (VHW), which is present in TCS1 and CaMXMT but absent in CaMTLs. It is tempting to speculate that substrate specificity of this class is determined by a few particular amino acids, and further investigations with point-mutated proteins are needed to clarify this point. Despite the similar pH optimum for activity, the substrate specificities of CaMXMT and TCS1 are clearly different. Whereas both native and recombinant TCS1 equally show catalytic activity toward the 1-N- and 3-N-sites of the purine ring, CaMXMT catalyzes only 3-N-methylation (Table I). In a crude extract of coffee fruits, the capacity of 1-N-methylation of theobromine to caffeine was detected (8Roberts M.F. Waller G.R. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 451-455Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and we have confirmed this with crude extracts of young leaves. 2M. Ogawa, Y. Herai, N. Koizumi, T. Kusano, and H. Sano, unpublished observation. Since recombinant CaMXMT did not show any 1-N-methylation activity, it is obvious that, in coffee plants, 3-N- and 1-N-methylation is catalyzed by different enzymes. This is consistent with findings that the apparent K m for xanthine derivatives markedly differs among enzymes. Crude enzymes exhibit K m values for both 7-methylxanthine and theobromine ranging between 100 and 500 μm (13Mosli Waldhauser S.S. Kretschmar J.A. Baumann T.W. Phytochemistry. 1997; 44: 853-859Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is also the case for purified tea CS, except that it has much higher affinity for paraxanthine, with a K m of 24 μm (14Kato M. Mizuno K. Fujimura T. Iwama M. Irie M. Crozier A. Ashihara H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Such differential K m values suggest that, despite apparent multifunctional properties, each enzyme may be able to select its correct substrate. CaMXMT methylates predominantly 7mX with a K m of 50 μm, a much higher affinity than for any other enzymes reported. The observations suggest that enzymes involved in caffeine synthesis may possess rather strict substrate preference and that this arises from diversity in a few amino acids. The transcript accumulation profiles of CaMXMT,XMT, and CaMTLs were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR with specific primers for each to avoid cross-hybridization between CaMXMT and CaMTLs. Transcripts of CaMXMT and XMT accumulated in young leaves and stems containing buds, suggesting that biosynthesis of caffeine occurs mainly in those tissues in coffee plants. This is consistent with the fact that theobromine and caffeine are primarily found in their buds and young leaves (5Ashihara H. Monteiro A.M. Gillies F.M. Crozier A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the transcript accumulation profile of CaMTL3 is similar to that of CaMXMT and XMP, suggesting its involvement in the metabolism of caffeine-related compounds. Examination of the subcellular localization of CaMXMT using the fusion protein of CaMXMT and GFP demonstrated an existence predominantly in the cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells. The PSORT program with the deduced amino acid sequence also predicted a high possibility of cytoplasmic localization for CaMXMT.2 It can thus be concluded that caffeine biosynthesis occurs in the cytoplasm of cells in buds and young leaves. It is worthy of mention that CaMXMT may have practical applications. To cope with occasional health problems caused by caffeine, decaffeinated coffee is currently produced by chemical treatment of coffee beans. Recombinant DNA technology usingCaMXMT may remove the need for this by creating caffeineless coffee plants. Furthermore, the opposite approach may also be applicable to important crops in such a way as to produce caffeine derivatives as insect repellants. We thank Drs. H. Ashihara, M.

The dual functionality of PTH may stem from its ability to activate two signal transduction mechanisms: adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C. Here, we demonstrate that continuous treatment of UMR 106-01 and primary osteoblasts with PTH peptides, which selectively activate protein kinase C, results in significant increases in DNA synthesis. Given that ERKs are involved in cellular proliferation, we examined the regulation of ERKs in UMR 106-01 and primary rat osteoblasts following PTH treatment. We demonstrate that treatment of osteoblastic cells with very low concentrations of PTH (10−12 to 10−11m) is sufficient for substantial increases in ERK activity. Treatment with PTH-(1–34) (10−8m), PTH-(1–31), or 8-bromo-cAMP failed to stimulate ERKs, whereas treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, serum, or PTH peptides lacking the N-terminal amino acids stimulated activity. Furthermore, the activation of ERKs was prevented by pretreatment of osteoblastic cells with inhibitors of protein kinase C (GF 109203X) and MEK (PD 98059). Treatment of UMR cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF), but not PTH, promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Transient transfection of UMR cells with p21N17Ras did not block activation of ERKs following treatment with low concentrations of PTH. Thus, activation of ERKs and proliferation by PTH is protein kinase C-dependent, but stimulation occurs independently of the EGF receptor and Ras activation.

Furthermore, studies with N-terminal peptides of PTH demonstrate a requirement for the first 2 amino acids in the activation of adenylate cyclase (8Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R.

The ability of PTH to activate adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA) is mediated via the stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs). PTH also directs the Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase C and ultimately PKC (5Civitelli R. Reid I.R. Westbrook S. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Am. J.

Although these signaling pathways mediate the alterations of gene expression and proliferation in osteoblastic cells, the mechanism(s) involved are still poorly understood. The MAPK signaling pathway is tightly coupled to the regulation of cell proliferation and viability. The PTH/PTHrP receptor couples to G-protein signaling pathways known to regulate MAPKs in many systems (15Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTH stimulates proliferation in bone (2Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and kidney cells (16Garcia-Ocana A. Gomez-Casero E. Penaranda C. Esbrit P. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 2267-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This combined evidence suggests that PTH may regulate MAPK in target tissues. Two of the best characterized MAPKs, ERK1/p42mapk and ERK2/p44mapk, are regulated by agonists interacting with growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors (17Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). ERK1 and ERK2 are activated by dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine by the upstream MAPK kinase MEK1 or MEK2 (18Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L.

Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is known that activation of the MAPK pathway originates from several distinct classes of cell-surface receptors in a manner dependent on or independent of the small GTP-binding protein Ras (15Luttrell L.M.

Previously, it was shown that PTH-(1–34) could inhibit MAPK in UMR 106-01 and ROS 17/2.8 cells (27Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H.

Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) via a PKA-dependent pathway. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, PMA was shown to stimulate both proliferation and phosphorylation of ERKs, and these effects were blocked by pretreatment with forskolin (35Siddhanti S.R. Hartle J.E., II Quarles L.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4834-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, low concentrations of PTH were shown to activate ERKs and proliferation in opossum kidney cells (36Cole J.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5771-5779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKC is known to activate MAPK, it is possible that the ability of PTH to activate PKC and ERKs is a potential mechanism for the anabolic effects of PTH. Here, we demonstrate that activation of ERKs and proliferation in osteoblastic cells occurs following treatment with low concentrations of PTH. This activation is dependent upon PKC, but not PKA, and does not require activation of the small G-protein Ras or phosphorylation of the EGFR. This study supports PTH as a mitogen and demonstrates that the proliferative effects of PTH are dependent upon selective PKC activation, resulting in ERK activation.

The pcDNA3 plasmid alone or containing dominant-negative mutant p21N17Ras under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was graciously provided by Dr. Joseph Baldassare (Saint Louis University School of Medicine). Osteoblastic cells were cultured as previously described (37Puccinelli J.M. Omura T.H. Strege D.W. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Cell.

For serum starvation, osteoblastic cells were allowed to grow to 70–80% confluence and then switched to Eagle's minimal essential medium without FBS for 48 h unless stated otherwise. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from rat calvariae as described (38Shalhoub V. Gerstenfeld L.C. Collart D. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5318-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and seeded at 6.24 × 103 cells/cm2. UMR 106-01 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm Petri dish and transiently transfected with pcDNA3 plasmids containing dominant-negative mutant p21N17Ras. Transfections were performed as described (39Tyson D.R. Swarthout J.T. Partridge N.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Effectene (QIAGEN Inc.). Briefly, cells were seeded, allowed to adhere overnight, and transfected with 1.0 μg of total DNA. 18 h after transfection, UMR cells were serum-starved for 48 h and treated as described below for the immune complex assay. Osteoblastic cells were seeded at 3 × 104/cm2 (UMR 106-01) or 6.24 × 103/cm2 (primary rat osteoblastic cells), allowed to adhere overnight, serum-starved for 24 h, and treated continuously in the presence or absence of appropriate agents for 24 h. Osteoblastic cells were pulsed-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 2 h just prior to the end of the incubation period and harvested by trypsinization, followed by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse the cells. The lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min, passed through a 0.45-μm HA filter (Millipore Corp.), washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% ethanol, dried, and placed in 10 ml of scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801). PKC activity was measured using a Pierce colorimetric PKC assay kit, SpinZymeTM format (product no. 29542). Cell lysis and membrane preparation were performed as previously described (40Chakravarthy B.R. Bussey A. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Durkin J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PKC activity was measured in lysates prepared from cytosolic and membrane fractions by incubation with fluorescently labeled MBP substrate. The reaction mixture was applied to a separation unit with an affinity membrane that specifically binds phosphorylated substrate. Quantitation of the phosphorylated product was performed by measuring absorbance at 570 nm, with the amount of peptide obtained being directly proportional to the amount of specific kinase activity present in each sample. Extrapolation of activity was performed from a linear regression generated using known amounts of PKC active enzyme. Serum-starved osteoblastic cells were treated in the presence and absence of appropriate agents for the indicated time periods at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Monolayers were scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). Protein contents of the supernatants were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) at 595 nm. For each assay, 100 μg of total protein were used; the volume was adjusted to 200 μl; 3 μg of anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies were added; and the samples were rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. At this time, 30 μl of protein A-acrylic beads were added, and the samples were rotated from 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The immune complex was washed three times with cold lysis buffer, three times with 0.5 m LiCl and 100 mmTris (pH 7.6), and once with assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.03% Brij 35, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in 20 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 10 μg of MBP/assay for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated via the addition of 7.5 μl of SDS sample buffer (0.063m Tris (pH 6.8), 1% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and boiling for 5 min. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, 10 μl of each reaction were resolved on a 12.75% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; and after drying, the gel was exposed to x-ray film. Quantitation was performed by scanning the gel with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Cell lysates containing 50 μg of total protein in lysis buffer were boiled for 5 min with 2× SDS sample buffer, centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 3 min), and placed on ice. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 6 and 12% stacking and resolving gels, respectively. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 100 V for 1 h. After blocking the membrane in 0.1% Tween 20, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was probed with anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibodies (diluted 1:1000), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:10,000). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by ECL following the manufacturer's protocol. UMR 106-01 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were treated as indicated. Lysates were prepared as described for the ERK immune complex assay, and equal amounts of protein (0.2 mg) from each sample were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of polyclonal anti-EGFR or monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody. Samples were then incubated for an additional 2 h with protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C, and the antigen-antibody complexes were collected by centrifugation. Pellets were boiled for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer and resolved on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, samples were immunoblotted with PY20 to assess EGFR phosphorylation content or with anti-EGFR antibody to identify the EGFR. Experimental significance was assessed using one-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis of multiple comparison using Dunnett's pairwise method. All other data shown are representative of at least three separate experiments with similar results. Although PTH (10−8m) activates PKA and is inhibitory to cellular proliferation and DNA synthesis in UMR 106-01 cells (4Partridge N.C. Kemp B.E. Veroni M.C. Martin T.J.

Furthermore, we used N-terminal PTH peptides to determine any involvement of PKC or PKA. Following serum starvation for 24 h, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with PTH-(1–34) (10−8m) alone or with the selective inhibitor PD 98059 (MEK), GF 109203X (PKC), or H-89 (PKA). As shown in Fig. 1 A, PTH at this concentration was unable on its own to stimulate proliferation. However, inhibition of PKA by the addition of H-89 resulted in a significant ∼2-fold increase (p = 0.001) in [3H]thymidine incorporation, whereas GF 109203X and PD 98059 had no effect. We next examined the ability of N-terminal PTH deletion peptides to stimulate proliferation (Fig. 1 B). Following serum starvation, UMR 106-01 cells were incubated with PTH-(1–31) (activates PKA, but not PKC) or with PTH-(3–34) (unable to activate PKA). Since PTH-(3–34) also promotes release of intracellular calcium, UMR 106-01 cells were also treated with PTH-(13–34) and PTH-(28–48), peptides that selectively activate PKC. We observed significant increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation following treatment with PTH-(3–34) (p = 0.003), PTH-(13–34) (p = 0.0007), and PTH-(28–48) (p = 0.01), but not with PTH-(1–31). Finally, we determined if the significant increases in proliferation we previously observed with low doses of PTH (34Partridge N.C. Opie A.L. Opie R.T. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and with PTH-(3–34) were PKC-dependent. Following serum starvation, UMR 106-01 cells were incubated with either PTH-(1–34) (10−11m) or PTH-(3–34) (10−8m) with or without the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X at 5 μm (Fig. 1 C). We observed an ∼3-fold increase in thymidine incorporation following treatment with 10−11m PTH-(1–34) (p = 0.01) or PTH-(3–34) (p = 0.01), and both were significantly inhibited by the addition of GF 109203X (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). To correlate enhanced proliferation with an increase in cell number, a complete dose response experiment with PTH-(1–34) followed by cell counting was performed. We observed a significant increase (p = 0.016) in cell number from 3.7 × 105/well with controls to 5.2 × 105/well following treatment with 10−11m PTH for 72 h. Since we observed significant increases in proliferation of UMR 106-01 cells at low doses of PTH (10−11m) and these increases appear to be PKC-dependent, we performed a dose response experiment with PTH to determine the minimal concentration required for activation of PKC (Fig. 2). Following 24 h of serum starvation, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PTH for 2 min, and PKC activity was assayed in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. PKC activity was measured by a colorimetric assay and is defined as picomoles of phosphate incorporated into substrate at 37 °C for 30 min. We observed a significant increase (p < 0.001) in translocation to the membrane and associated PKC activity at 10−11m PTH. Although 10−11m PTH was sufficient to activate PKC, higher concentrations were necessary for increased PKA activity. We have previously shown PKA to be activated to 30% of the maximum at 10−9m PTH in UMR 106-01 cells, with half-maximal activation at 5 × 10−8m PTH (41Partridge N.C. Kemp B.E. Livesey A. Martin T.J. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results are similar to those of Fujimori et al. (42Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ERK subclass (ERK1/p42mapk and ERK2/p44mapk) of MAPKs is activated by major signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation (43Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in UMR 106-01 and fibroblast cells. However, since we had demonstrated activation of PKC by N-terminal PTH peptides or low doses of PTH-(1–34) that were also able to stimulate proliferation, we investigated the effect of PTH on MAPK activity in UMR 106-01 osteoblastic cells (Fig. 3). To quantify the effect of PTH-(1–34) on ERK activity, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with immunoprecipitated ERK1/ERK2 in which MBP was a substrate. ERK activity was measured in osteoblastic cells 15 min after the addition of PTH, which we had found was the time of maximal stimulation (data not shown). Treatment of UMR cells with 10−12 and 10−11m PTH resulted in significant increases (p< 0.05) in the -fold stimulation of ERK activity (2.9- and 2.8-fold, respectively) above basal levels (Fig. 3). Additionally, UMR cells were treated with 5% FBS as a positive control for ERK activation. Treatment for 15 min with 5% FBS resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in ERK activity above basal levels (Fig. 3). Next, a complete dose response was performed with increasing concentrations of PTH (Fig.4 A). Treatment of UMR cells with 10−12, 10−11, 10−10, 10−9, or 10−8m PTH or 5% FBS resulted in 3.2-, 2.6-, 2.9-, 1.5-, 1.6-, and 3.3-fold increases above basal activation. The addition of medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum was performed as a positive control for ERK activation. In primary osteoblasts (Fig. 4 B), the results were similar, with 3.9-, 5-, 4.7-, 1.2-, 1.4-, and 10-fold increases above basal activation. These results clearly demonstrate that activation of MAPK by PTH is dose-dependent. Treatment of osteoblastic cells with concentrations of PTH in the lower range stimulated ERKs, whereas higher concentrations, which activated PKA maximally, were unable to stimulate ERKs. Interestingly, although treatment with 10−12m PTH was unable to significantly (p = 0.15) stimulate PKC above basal levels (Fig. 2), the level of activation was sufficient to stimulate ERK activity. The ERK assays were performed with equal amounts of total protein from whole cell lysates. Therefore, Western blotting was performed to examine the relative levels of ERK1/ERK2 protein present for each assay.Figure 4Effect of various concentrations of PTH on ERK activities in UMR 106-01 and primary osteoblasts. ERK activation was assayed for a wide range of PTH concentrations in osteoblastic cells following serum starvation. Cells were serum-starved for 48 h and treated with Eagle's minimal essential medium without (control (C)) or with 10−12, 10−11, 10−10, 10−9, or 10−8m PTH or 5% FBS for 15 min. ERK activity in cell lysates from osteoblastic cells (A, UMR 106-01 cells; B, primary rat osteoblasts) was analyzed by immune complex kinase assays with polyclonal anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies and MBP as substrate (upper panels).

In steady-state reactions with the accessory protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), pol δ preferred to incorporate dCTP opposite 8-oxoG with an efficiency of incorporation an order of magnitude lower than incorporation into unmodified DNA (mainly due to an increased K m). Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of incorporation opposite 8-oxoG showed biphasic kinetics for incorporation of either dCTP or dATP, with rates similar to dCTP incorporation opposite G, large phosphorothioate effects (>100), and oligonucleotide dissociation apparently rate-limiting in the steady-state. Although pol δ preferred to incorporate dCTP (14% misincorporation of dATP) the extension past the A:8-oxoG mispair predominated. The presence of PCNA was found to be a more essential factor for nucleotide incorporation opposite 8-oxoG adducts than unmodified DNA, increased pre-steady-state rates of nucleotide incorporation by >2 orders of magnitude, and was essential for nucleotide extension beyond 8-oxoG. pol δ replication fidelity at 8-oxoG depends upon contributions from K m, KddNTP, and rates of phosphodiester bond formation, and PCNA is an important accessory protein for incorporation and extension at 8-oxoG adducts.

High fidelity DNA replication is critical to the preservation of genomic stability and the avoidance of mutations that can disrupt the regulation of complex biological systems. Cells contain several DNA polymerases and complex DNA repair systems to preserve genomic integrity (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Accurate replication is disrupted by the presence of covalent DNA-chemical adducts, which can be misread and lead to mutations and cancer (3Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. 1 and 2. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984Google Scholar). Understanding the miscoding events induced by modified DNA is important in understanding risks of environmental chemicals, as well as aspects of chemotherapeutic treatment. Misincorporation is primarily a kinetic phenomenon and not simply thermodynamic. Work with several DNA adducts and artificial DNA bases clearly indicates that both the identity of incorporated bases and their frequency of substitution are functions of which polymerase is used as a catalyst (4Morales J.C.

This lesion is generally regarded as being the most abundant of those induced by oxidative damage (15Kuchino Y. Mori F. Kasai H. Inoue H. Iwai S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Nishimura S. Nature. 1987; 327: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 16Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Mutation Res. 1991; 250: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 17Kasai H. Crain P.F. Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Ootsuyama A. Tanooka H. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1849-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Polymerases derived from prokaryotic systems have been used extensively as models for mechanistic studies because of their availability, the general lack of need for complex accessory proteins, and the availability of structural and mechanistic information (18Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The question arises as to how relevant findings made with these enzymes are to mammalian and other eukaryotic polymerases, particularly those polymerases that will copy past sites of DNA damage. Recent studies indicate the presence of low fidelity, distributive polymerases in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that are involved in translesion DNA synthesis (6Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 19Goodman M.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J.

However, the extent to which the mammalian forms are able to copy past chemical lesions other than photodamaged pyrimidines is largely unexplored, and the question of how lesions interact with replicative DNA polymerases is important. Recently we used purified calf thymus DNA pol δ, considered to be the main leading strand DNA polymerase (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), in a series of steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic experiments and concluded that the major features of the catalytic mechanism were very similar to those established in the prokaryotic models (21Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, questions about the processing of chemical-DNA adducts remain. Some work has been done on the replication of mammalian pol δ past DNA adducts and misincorporation. O'Day et al. (22O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M.J. Taylor J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5403-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that the presence of the accessory protein PCNA enabled pol δ bypass of cyclobutane thymine dimers, as judged by qualitative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments. Using similar approaches, Mozzherin et al. (23Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PCNA stimulated pol δ incorporation and bypass at abasic sites and 8-oxoG and C 8-(2-aminofluorenyl)guanine modifications (but not C 8-(2-acetamidofluorenyl)guanine). The increase in the amount of extended products was 2.5-fold for 8-oxoG andC 8-(2-aminofluorenyl)guanine but more for abasic sites. The mechanism was concluded to involve extension of the new primer terminus (resulting from incorporation), facilitated by a decreased pol δ:DNA off-rate (k off) by PCNA. However, other mechanisms could not be excluded. Other work by Mozzherin et al. (24Mozzherin D.J. McConnell M. Jasko M.V. Krayezsky A.A. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31711-31717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicated that the presence of PCNA led to more errors in the incorporation of nucleotides in unmodified oligonucleotides, a result also rationalized in terms of a decreased DNA k off for pol δ due to PCNA (24Mozzherin D.J.

We studied the incorporation of dCTP and dATP opposite 8-oxoG in an oligonucleotide primer-template complex with purified calf thymus pol δ and recombinant human PCNA, using steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic approaches. The results show a strong dependence on the presence of PCNA for the polymerization rate constant (k pol) and extension beyond the lesion, and the effects of phosphorothioate substitution of dNTPs suggest that the rate-limiting step may be phosphodiester bond formation. Primer and template oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and purified as described previously (9Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P.

Final concentrations were 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 0.2 mg of bovine serum albumin ml−1, 100 nm 24/36G-mer or 24/36 8-oxoG-mer, 3.1 nm pol δ, 36 nm PCNA, 6 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 10 μl. The reactions were run at 37 °C in triplicate and quenched with 20 μl of 20 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) after 5 min. The products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16% acrylamide (w/v), 1.5% bisacrylamide (w/v), 8.0 m urea) and the amount of primer extended was quantitated utilizing a Molecular Dynamics Model 400E PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and Image Software version 3.3. k cat andK m values were determined by nonlinear regression using a k·cat computer program (Biometallics, Princeton, NJ). In steady-state reactions performed in the absence of PCNA, the pol δ concentration was increased to 27 nm and reaction time to 10 min. A similar procedure was used for incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP opposite A and C. A complementary oligonucleotide to the 24/36G-mer was used with a C or A in the position of the incoming dNTP (9Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The concentrations of pol δ and PCNA were 3.1 and 72 nm, respectively, in the buffer described above. Reactions were done in the presence of varying concentrations of 8-oxo-dGTP for 5 min (opposite C) or 10 min (opposite A), and the results were analyzed as for other steady-state experiments. Pre-steady-state rapid-quench experiments were performed utilizing a KinTek Quench Flow Apparatus (Model RQF-3, KinTek, Austin, TX). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of dNTP in Buffer A with a primer/template/pol δ solution with or without PCNA at 37 °C. The final concentrations of the reactants were 10–95 nm pol δ (based on the limiting subunit of pol δ), 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 180 or 400 nm PCNA, 0.2 mg bovine serum albumin ml−1, and 100 nm primer/template. The reactions were quenched with equal volumes of 0.6 m EDTA at times varying from 5 ms to 10 s. The products were analyzed as described for steady-state assays. k pol (maximum rate of nucleotide incorporation) was determined by a fit of the data to the burst equation: y = A(1 −e −kpt) +k sst, where A = burst amplitude,k p = first-order rate constant, t = time, and k ss = steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation. The kinetic K d value for dCTP or dATP binding to pol δ·PCNA·24/36 8-oxoG-mer complexes was estimated by pre-steady-state rapid-quench analysis. The dNTP concentration dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rates was examined by varying the concentration of dNTP and measuring the pre-steady-state burst rates of dNTP incorporation into the 24/36 8-oxoG-mer duplex DNA. The values of k pol were determined as described above. The pre-steady-state rates were plotted against [dNTP] and the data was fit to the hyperbolak obs = [k pol[dNTP]/([dNTP] +K d)] to determine K d (30Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K d values for productive pol δ binding to 24/36 8-oxoG-mer or 24/36G-mer complexes in the presence of PCNA were determined by pre-steady-state rapid quench analysis. The DNA concentration was varied and the changes in the burst amplitude were measured to determine enzyme active site concentration and the K d for binding DNA. TheK d was determined by plotting the burst amplitudes against the concentration of DNA and then fitting the data to the quadratic equation [E·D] = 0.5(K d + E t +D t) − [0.25(K d +E t + Dt )2 −E t D t]1/2, whereE t = [total enzyme], D t = [total DNA], and K d = dissociation constant for the reaction E + D ↔ E·D. The steady-steady kinetics of elongation of the 5′32P-labeled 24/36 8-oxoG-mer duplex DNA (TableI) to 25/36 8-oxoG-mer product were measured as a function of dCTP or dATP concentration dependence using a large excess of 24/36 8-oxoG-mer (100 nm) relative to pol δ (3.1 nm). The steady-state k catvalues for dCTP or dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG in the presence of PCNA were 0.0055 s−1, similar to thek cat for dCTP incorporation into unmodified DNA (0.0035 s−1) (21Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). K m values for dCTP and dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG were determined to be 1.3 and 4.1 μm, respectively, an order of magnitude higher than the K m for correct nucleotide incorporation into unmodified DNA, 0.067 μm (TableII). 2Using the k cat andK m values, a “misincorporation frequency” (f) of 0.33 can be estimated, with caveats of the limitations of these single nucleotide incorporation experiments, defined as f = [(k cat/K m)A/(k cat/K m)c], estimated % misincorporation = (f/[1 +f]) × 100. The preference for incorporation of dCTP opposite 8-oxoG is reflected in a misinsertion frequency (f) of 0.33, which corresponds to 24% misincorporation (for dATP).Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters for pol δk catK mk cat/K ms−1μmmm−1s−1C:GdCTP+PCNA0.0035 ± 0.00010.067 ± 0.01152 ± 9—↓2-aLines represent nucleotide sequences; see Table I.—G—−PCNA0.0020 ± 0.00011.2 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.5C:8-oxoGdCTP+PCNA0.0055 ± 0.00021.3 ± 0.24.2 ± 1.0—↓—G*—2-bG*, 8-oxoG.−PCNA0.0040 ± 0.00008510 ± 370.008 ± 0.002A:8-oxoGdATP+PCNA0.0055 ± 0.00034.1 ± 0.91.3 ± 0.33—↓—G*—−PCNA0.00035 ± 0.0000519 ± 80.018 ± 0.0062-a Lines represent nucleotide sequences; see Table I.2-b G*, 8-oxoG. Open table in a new tab PCNA has been reported to increase the processivity of pol δ replication and the bypass of abasic sites and DNA adducts, such as 8-oxoG, C 8-(2-aminofluorenyl)guanine, and cyclobutane thymine dimers (22O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M.J. Taylor J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5403-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When PCNA was omitted, thek cat for dCTP and dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG was either similar or 16-fold lower (0.0040 and 0.00035 s−1, respectively) than in reactions containing PCNA (Table II). The K m values were 400 and 5-fold higher (510 and 19 μm) for dCTP and dATP incorporation, respectively. Previous studies with other polymerases had shown asymmetry in the pairing of 8-oxoG with C and A, depending on whether the 8-oxoG was in the DNA template or the incoming nucleotide (9Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These studies were repeated with pol δ, in the presence of PCNA. The steady-state k cat values estimated for incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP opposite C and A were 0.0030 (± 0.0003) and 0.0019 (± 0.0004) s−1, respectively. As in the case of the prokaryotic polymerases (9Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the K m values for incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP were much higher than for incorporation of dCTP or dATP opposite template 8-oxoG, 0.65 (±0.16) mmfor 8-oxo-dGTP incorporation opposite C and 13 (±5) mmopposite A. Thus, the efficiency (k cat/K m) of 8-oxo-dGTP incorporation is 3 orders of magnitude lower than for dCTP or dATP incorporation opposite template 8-oxoG. 3A misincorporation frequency (f) of 0.03 can be calculated, again with the caveats of limitations of single nucleotide incorporation experiments (see Footnote 2), corresponding to 3% misincorporation (of 8-oxo-dGTP opposite A) (Table II). This value is an order of magnitude lower than for dATP incorporation opposite template 8-oxoG, emphasizing the asymmetric nature of polymerases. Also, the 3% misincorporation frequency is much lower than observed for any other polymerases examined, except for E. coli pol II exo− (9Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of dCTP or dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG by pol δ was performed to discern contributions of specific steps in the catalytic cycle important for fidelity of incorporation opposite 8-oxoG. The rate of polymerization (k pol) can be measured by rapid quench kinetics and includes rates of dNTP binding, any associated conformational changes, and phosphodiester bond formation. The incorporation of dCTP or dATP into the 24/36 8-oxoG-mer by pol δ in the presence of PCNA showed biphasic kinetics, fitted to an initial burst followed by a linear phase (Fig. 1). The burst phase represents the rate of single nucleotide incorporation in the first turnover of the enzyme. k pol was determined to be 22 s−1 for dCTP incorporation and 21 s−1for dATP incorporation. These values were similar to the rate of dCTP incorporation opposite unmodified G (28 s−1). The amplitude of the burst corresponds to the concentration of “active” enzyme present in the reactions. The amplitude was ∼4 nmfor dCTP incorporation and ∼2 nm for dATP incorporation, indicating that 8 and 4% of the pol δ is in an active conformation in these reactions, respectively. These values were calculated based upon the 11 nm burst product formed in reactions containing 51 nm pol δ for dCTP incorporation opposite unmodified G, or 36%, from this preparation of pol δ (results not shown). When PCNA was excluded from the pre-steady-state reactions, no apparent burst of dCTP or dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG was observed, even at pol δ concentrations of 95 nm (Fig.2). The apparent rates of polymerization in the absence of PCNA were 0.032 and 0.018 s−1 for dCTP and dATP incorporation, respectively, 3 orders of magnitude less than with PCNA and indicating that PCNA is essential for formation of an active pol δ complex capable of nucleotide incorporation opposite 8-oxoG. The rate of polymerization was examined for a phosphorothioate elemental effect to determine if the rate of a single nucleotide incorporation event is influenced by phosphodiester bond formation (chemistry step). Replacement of the α-phosphate group of a dNTP with a phosphorothioate can reduce the rate of k pol by ∼102-fold if the rate of polymerization is a direct function of the chemistry step. The rates of dCTP and dATP incorporation by pol δ in the presence of PCNA were reduced by a factor of 900–1000 (Fig. 1). The results are interpreted to mean that phosphodiester bond formation may be the rate-limiting step for both dCTP and dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG and that the rate of polymerization (k pol) is a direct reflection of this chemical step. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the next correct base (dGTP) insertion beyond C:8-oxoG or A:8-oxoG pairs was examined to determine whether pol δ has a preference for extension of either base pair. In the presence of PCNA (Fig. 3 A), pol δ efficiently extended the A:8-oxoG base pair (k pol = 27 s−1) an order of magnitude faster than C:8-oxoG base pairs (k pol = 1 s−1). When PCNA was omitted (Fig. 3 B), rates of next correct base pair insertion decreased 70-fold for A:8-oxoG base pairs (0.38 s−1) and 4-fold for C:8-oxoG base pairs (0.24 s−1) and no bursts of nucleotide incorporation occurred. The pre-steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation into the 24/36 8-oxoG-mer primer/template was determined as a function of the concentration of dCTP (results not shown) or dATP (Fig.4). The KddCTP for DNA modified with 8-oxoG was 8 μm and the KddATP was 42 μm. These values are considerably higher than the KddNTP for dCTP binding to unmodified DNA (0.93 μm) (21Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). KdDNA, which describes the reaction E·PCNA + DNA ↔E·DNA·PCNA, was determined by examining the DNA concentration dependence on the burst amplitude of dCTP incorporation by pol δ. A fixed amount of pol δ was incubated with increasing concentrations of 24/36G-mer or 24/36 8-oxoG-mer and the reactions were initiated with the addition of saturating dCTP for 100 ms, at which maximal burst amplitudes were observed with negligible effect from multiple turnovers of the enzyme (Fig.5). The KdDNAfor the reaction pol δ·PCNA + 24/36G-mer ↔ pol δ·PCNA·24/36G-mer was determined to be 64 ± 10 nm (21Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the KdDNA was 2-fold higher, 124 (± 24) nm, with the 8-oxoG-modified DNA. When PCNA was omitted, no appreciable burst of nucleotide incorporation occurred even with 1 μm DNA (results not shown). The major features of the catalytic mechanism of correct nucleotide insertion into unmodified DNA by pol δ are similar to those of the prokaryotic DNA polymerases (21Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Abstract F"

Here we report that transgenic expression of a dominant-active Drosophila Rho guanosine triphosphatase, Drac1, rescued photoreceptor morphogenesis in rhodopsin-null mutants; expression of dominant-negative Drac1 resulted in a phenotype similar to that seen in rhodopsin-null mutants. Drac1 was localized in a specialization of the photoreceptor cortical actin cytoskeleton, which was lost in rhodopsin-null mutants. Thus, rhodopsin appears to organize the actin cytoskeleton through Drac1, contributing a structural support essential for photoreceptor morphogenesis."

Both enzymes are members of the RecQ family of helicases, have a 3′ → 5′ polarity, and require a 3′ single strand tail. In addition to their activity in unwinding duplex substrates, recent studies show that the two enzymes are able to unwind G2 and G4 tetraplexes, prompting speculation that failure to resolve these structures in Bloom syndrome and Werner syndrome cells may contribute to genome instability. The triple helix is another alternate DNA structure that can be formed by sequences that are widely distributed throughout the human genome. Here we show that purified Bloom and Werner helicases can unwind a DNA triple helix. The reactions are dependent on nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis and require a free 3′ tail attached to the third strand. The two enzymes unwound triplexes without requirement for a duplex extension that would form a fork at the junction of the tail and the triplex. In contrast, a duplex formed by the third strand and a complement to the triplex region was a poor substrate for both enzymes. However, the same duplex was readily unwound when a noncomplementary 5′ tail was added to form a forked structure.

Moreover, many studies have described the role of these elements in DNA rearrangements such as deletions, sister chromatid exchanges, homologous and illegitimate recombination events, etc. (reviewed in Refs. 9Pearson C.E.

With such an array of provocative sequence elements, it seems likely that cells would have developed the capacity for controlling the potential of these sequences for genome destabilization. Some insight into the nature of the enzymology involved in the maintenance of genetic integrity has come from the study of two “genome instability” disorders, Bloom and Werner syndrome. Patients with Werner syndrome (WS)1are characterized by premature aging (11Martin G.M. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 356-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a high incidence of certain cancers. They have elevated frequencies of spontaneous deletion mutations in the HPRT gene (12Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mutant gene in WS has been identified as a member of the RecQ helicase family, and the protein is a 3′–5′-helicase (15Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S.

Finally, the chromosomal instability of WS cells suggests that the enzyme plays an anti-recombinogenic role in wild type cells. Bloom syndrome (BS) patients display a variety of symptoms, among them growth retardation, immunodeficiency, sun sensitivity, and a marked propensity to develop cancers of all varieties (27German J.

Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) and are found, among other places, at telomeres (42Miyagawa K. Int. J.

Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9517-9523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). They can form under physiological conditions and inhibit DNA synthesis in vitro(46Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested by many authors that these complexes, appearing as the result of single strand exposure during replication, recombination, or transcription, could play a causal role in genomic rearrangements, including strand exchange, strand slippage, and the size changes seen in the triplet expansion disorders. The possibility that the genomic instability of the WS and BS disorders might be due to a failure to resolve alternate DNA structures has generated considerable interest (47Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The triple helix is another alternate DNA structure that can be formed by sequences that are widely distributed throughout the human genome (1Manor H. Rao B.S. Martin R.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Triplexes have been known for many years (Ref. 48Felsenfeld G. Davies D.R. Rich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2023-2024Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar and reviewed in Refs. 49Thuong N.T. Helene C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and are generated when a third strand lies in the major groove of duplex DNA. They occur most readily on polypurine:polypyrimidine sequences, and the third strand may be composed of either pyrimidines or purines, with the most stable resultant structure dictated by the specific sequence (51Fossella J.A. Kim Y.J. Shih H. Richards E.G. Fresco J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). They can form when an appropriate sequence partially melts with one of the single strands folding back to complex with the adjacent duplex (52Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and have been demonstrated in chromosomes and nuclei (53Agazie Y.M. Burkholder G.D. Lee J.S. Biochem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These complexes can also be formed by oligonucleotides directed against specific target sequences. This has prompted their consideration as gene-targeting reagents (55Chan P.P. Glazer P.M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 56Giovannangeli C. Helene C.

Sci. 1998; 23: 4-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although there is a 4-decade literature on triple helices and a considerable interest in the role of helicases in DNA transactions, there have been remarkably few studies on the activity of these enzymes on triplexes. The DDA protein of phage T4 can unwind a triplex (59Maine I.P. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as can the SV40 T antigen (60Kopel V. Pozner A. Baran N. Manor H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, there has been no report of the activity of human helicases with these substrates. In this report we describe the activity of the BLM and WRN helicases on a pyrimidine-purine:pyrimidine triple helix and corresponding duplex structures. Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human WRN protein was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described elsewhere (20Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human BLM protein was overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified as previously described (61Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). UvrD (DNA helicase II) was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Matson (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs. The following oligonucleotides were prepared: TC30, 5′-TCTTTTTCTTTCTTTTCTTCTTTTTTCTTT; TC30 5′ tail, 5′-TGACGCTCCGTACGA-TC30; TC30 3′ tail, 5′TC30-TCACGCTCCGTACGA. The cytosines in the TC30 portion were 5 methylcytosines. This modification stabilizes the triplexes at physiological pH (62Lee J.S. Woodsworth M.L. Latimer L.J. Morgan A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6603-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The 28-mer oligonucleotide 5′-TCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGG-3′ was from Life Technologies, Inc. M13mp18 ssDNA was from New England Biolabs. Ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, and ATPγS were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The plasmid psupF5 contains a duplex sequence that serves as a target for TC30 and related oligonucleotides. Cleavage of the plasmid with Nde I released fragments of 4 and 0.6 kilobase pairs. The triplex site lies 1800 bases from one end of the large fragment. Triplexes were prepared by incubation of 3 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide (based on the molecular weights of the reaction components) overnight at room temperature with 6 pmol of Nde I-cleaved plasmid in a buffer containing 33 mm Tris acetate, pH 5.5, 66 mm KOAc, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm spermine. The complexes were then separated from unbound oligonucleotide by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel A-5M resin. The 6-base pair duplex extension substrate was prepared as above by incubation of the 3′-tailed third strand with plasmid that was cleaved with Bgl II and filled in by incubation with Klenow polymerase. This construction placed the triplex at the extreme end of the duplex DNA with a 6-base pair duplex extension. The 3′-tailed “blunt triplex” was prepared by incubation of a 30-mer duplex oligonucleotide with the 3′-tailed third strand. This duplex contained the triplex region without extensions. A triplex was prepared by incubation of the 3′-tailed third strand with a duplex 30-base pair oligonucleotide consisting of the triplex target sequence. The triplex was diluted into the buffer used for the helicase assays (see below), and the thermal stability was determined in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrophotometer with a Peltier controlled thermal unit attached. The triplex target site overlaps anXba I site, which is blocked by triplex formation. 2 μg of psupF5 were incubated overnight with 2 μm of the 5′, or 3′, or blunt TC30 oligonucleotides in the buffer described above. The complexes were then separated from free oligonucleotide by ethanol precipitation from 2.5 m ammonium acetate. They were suspended in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermine, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and digested with Xba I and Pst I at 37 °C. Although in these experiments the triplexes were formed on circular plasmids prior to restriction digestion, triplex formation was equally efficient on linear DNA. To prepare the TC30 duplex DNA substrate, the TC30 3′ tail oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled and annealed to a 30-mer oligonucleotide complementary to TC30 (TC30′). The annealing mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol TC30′, and 4 pmol of32P-labeled TC30. The annealing mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool to room temperature over the course of 3 h. The forked duplex substrate was prepared by annealing a 50-mer that contained the 30-base complement of TC30 and a 20-base noncomplementary 5′ tail. The labeled annealed DNA duplexes were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) 1× Tris borate, EDTA gel, and the duplex fragment was excised. The DNA fragment was purified using the QIAEX II polyacrylamide gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The 28-base pair M13mp18 partial duplex substrate was constructed with a 28-mer complementary to positions 6296–6323 in M13mp18. The 28-base pair M13mp18 partial duplex substrates were constructed as described previously (63Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The 28-mer oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded DNA circles. Partial duplex DNA substrates were purified by gel filtration column chromatography using Bio-Gel A-5M resin (Bio-Rad). Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris borate, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmATP (or the indicated nucleoside 5′ triphosphate), and the indicated amounts of WRN or BLM helicase. The amount of the TC30 triplex or 3′-tailed duplex molecules in the reaction mixtures was ∼15 fmol. The amount of the M13 partial duplex molecules was 4 fmol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN or BLM protein and incubated at 24 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, a 10-μl aliquot of loading buffer (40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) was added to the mixture, and the products of helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (12% acrylamide, 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 25% glycerol) at 4 °C. The 30-mer 3′-tailed “blunt triplex” substrate was resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol. An excess of unlabeled third strand was added to the reaction mixtures at the end of the reaction to preclude reassociation of the unwound labeled third strand with the duplex. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager or film autoradiography and quantitated using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the following formula: % Displacement = 100 × P/(S +P). P is the product and S is the substrate. The values for P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured controls, respectively. Helicase data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. The recombinant WRN and BLM proteins were characterized by standard helicase and ATPase assays (not shown). The activity of the WRN enzyme with a duplex substrate, formed by the hybridization of a 28-base oligonucleotide to single strand circular M13, was measured. This substrate was almost completely unwound at higher concentrations of enzyme (30–60 nm) (data not shown). Unwinding of the M13 partial duplex by the BLM enzyme was virtually complete at enzyme concentrations ≥16 nm. The specific ATPase activities of WRN and BLM enzymes using M13mp18 single-stranded DNA as the DNA effector were determined to be 219 ± 14 and 1163 ± 358 min−1, respectively, consistent with previously published values (35Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 64Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We prepared triple helices with a pyrimidine motif third strand with 15 nucleotide 3′ or 5′ single strand tails or with no tail. The sequences of the target duplex and the third strands are shown in Fig. 1 A. These triplexes were stable at physiological pH. In the buffer used for the helicase assays the Tm of the TC30 triple helix was 57.9 °C, and the Tm of the underlying duplex was 62.9 °C. Duplex unwinding by both helicases is dependent on a single strand 3′ tail. All the triplexes used in these experiments were based on blunt duplexes, eliminating the possibility that triplex unwinding was due to the disruption of the underlying duplex. Triplex formation on the target sequence in psupF5 partially occludes anXba I site. As shown in Fig. 1 B protection of the site from Xba I cleavage could be demonstrated following triplex formation with the oligonucleotides, whereas cleavage byPst I, whose sites are not near the triplex target, was unaffected. Another plasmid (psupF12), which does not have the TC30 triplex target sequence, was also incubated with the TC30 oligonucleotides. However, as expected, there was no protection fromXba I digestion. WRN and BLM helicases are most active on duplex DNA with 3′ single strand tails (16Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar,40Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol.

Seidman, unpublished results. We asked if the helicases would be active with DNA triplexes with a 3′, 5′, or no single strand tail as depicted in Fig. 1 A. Each substrate was incubated with increasing amounts of the individual enzymes. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the WRN was active against the 3′ tail triplex with increasing amounts of triplex unwinding as a function of enzyme concentration. The extent of unwinding reached a plateau at 28 nm protein with 50% of the 3′ tail substrate unwound. There was no significant unwinding of the blunt and 5′ tail substrates. Similar data were obtained with the BLM helicase with only the 3′-tailed substrate unwound (Fig. 2 B). Unwinding was measurable at the lowest levels of enzyme, and more than 90% of the substrate was unwound at higher enzyme concentrations. The activity of helicases is dependent on a nucleoside triphosphate (65Matson S.W. Bean D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 389-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We examined the nucleotide preference of the WRN enzyme in unwinding the 3′ tail triplex substrate (data not shown). 21 nm enzyme was incubated with the substrate in the presence of the ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Unwinding was observed with dCTP (27%), CTP (50%), dATP (50%), and ATP (26%). There was no significant activity in the presence of the other triphosphates. The BLM helicase was less discriminating as extensive unwinding (80–90%) was observed with all triphosphates with the exception of UTP (71%) and TTP (26%). When ATPγS was substituted for the other triphosphates there was no unwinding with either enzyme. The substrate employed in the preceding experiments presented different structural elements to the enzymes. These included the single strand tail, the triplex region, and the duplex adjacent to the triplex. The nature of the junction between single strand tails and duplex substrate of different helicases is well known to affect enzyme activity (66Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 67Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

We wanted to know if the activity of the BLM and WRN helicases would also be affected by the nature of the junction between the single strand and the triplex. Accordingly, we prepared two additional substrates. The first was based on the substrate used in the previous experiments. The plasmid was linearized at theBgl II site (Fig. 1) and the 4-base 5′ overhang filled in by Klenow polymerase. This was incubated with the 3′-tailed third strand to produce a triplex with a 6-base duplex extension. This substrate maintained a long duplex region as before, and a junction of a 3′-tailed third strand, a triplex, and a short duplex extension. Both enzymes unwound more than 85% of this substrate (Fig.3). The second substrate consisted of the 3′-tailed third strand complexed to an oligonucleotide duplex such that there were no duplex extensions beyond the triplex (3′-tailed blunt triplex). This structure was unwound by the WRN enzyme, although less efficiently than the previous substrate (50% unwound at 56 nm WRN helicase) (Fig.4 A). The BLM enzyme was more active with this substrate with 80% unwound at 32 nmenzyme (Fig. 4 B). There was no activity with either enzyme in the presence of ATPγS. These experiments showed that both enzymes could unwind the triplex without a requirement for a single strand:double strand fork at the junction of the third strand and the triplex and without regard for the presence or absence of an associated long duplex region. It was of interest to know if the two enzymes would unwind a duplex substrate containing the same strand used in the triplex experiments. The 45-nucleotide fragment used as the third strand in the triplex experiments was hybridized with a 30-base oligonucleotide complementary to the triplex region. This produced a duplex with the same 3′ tail as in the triplex experiments. An amount of substrate equivalent to that used in the triplex experiments (“Materials and Methods”) was incubated with increasing amounts of each enzyme as before. The results of the titration with the WRN enzyme (Fig. 5 A) showed little or no unwinding at concentrations tha"

From our previous in vivo studies, it was evident that several phosphopeptides remained unidentified. In particular, we wished to determine whether human PR contains a phosphorylation site in the hinge region, as do other steroid receptors including chicken PR, human androgen receptor, and mouse estrogen receptor. Previously, problematic trypsin cleavage sites hampered our ability to detect phosphorylation sites in large incomplete tryptic peptides. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and in vitro phosphorylation, we have identified six previously unidentified phosphorylation sites in human PR. Using nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we have identified two new in vivo phosphorylation sites, Ser20 and Ser676, in baculovirus-expressed human PR. Ser676 is analogous to the hinge site identified in other steroid receptors. Additionally, precursor ion scans identified another phosphopeptide that contains Ser130-Pro131, a likely candidate for phosphorylation. In vitro phosphorylation of PR with Cdk2 has revealed five additional in vitro Cdk2 phosphorylation sites: Ser25, Ser213, Thr430, Ser554, and Ser676. At least two of these, Ser213 and Ser676, are authentic in vivo sites. We confirmed the presence of the Cdk2-phosphorylated peptide containing Ser213 in PR from in vivolabeled T47D cells, indicating that this is an in vivosite. Our combined studies indicate that most, if not all, of the Ser-Pro motifs in human PR are sites for phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that the phosphorylation of PR is highly complex, with at least 14 phosphorylation sites.

Some of these changes are due to direct alterations in receptor phosphorylation, whereas others appear to affect associated proteins (29Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Additionally, the role of individual sites has been examined for PR. Mutation of Ser190 results in decreased activity of PR (21Takimoto G.S. Hovland A.R. Tasset D.M. Melville M.Y. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13308-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since different kinases target unique subsets of sites and these phosphorylations may have opposing effects on receptor activity, it is important to know which sites are coregulated by each kinase for mutagenesis studies to determine the impact on receptor function. We have previously identified seven phosphorylation sites in human PR isolated from 32P-labeled T47D breast cancer cells. Each of these sites is located in the amino-terminal (A/B) domain. Three of the previously identified sites, Ser81, Ser102, and Ser162, are unique to the B form (15Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivolabeling of the endogenous PR in T47D cells showed that the PR is phosphorylated basally in the absence of hormone at serines 81, 162, 190, and 400. Upon hormone stimulation, the net phosphorylation of these basal sites is dramatically increased within 5 min of treatment. In addition, hormone induces the phosphorylation of three new phosphorylation sites, serines 102, 294, and 345, in a temporally delayed manner, requiring 2 h for maximal phosphorylation. These sites are referred to as the hormone-dependent phosphorylation sites (16Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human PR expressed in Sf9 insect cells displays the same phosphorylation pattern as PR from hormone-treated T47D cells; however, the hormone dependence is lacking in Sf9 cells (36Beck C.A. Zhang Y. Altmann M. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19546-19555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that PR is a substrate for several kinases in vitro. We reported previously that three in vivo phosphorylation sites, Ser162, Ser190, and Ser400, are phosphorylated in vitro by the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex (17Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Clement J.P.M. Prendergast P. Yip T.T. Hutchens T.W. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and that Ser81 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (15Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although many of the phosphorylation sites have been identified in PR, several phosphotryptic peptide peaks detected in the HPLC analyses ofin vivo labeled PR have yet to be identified. Most of the phosphorylation sites in steroid receptors contain Ser/Thr-Pro motifs, and in the case of the chicken PR all four of these motifs are phosphorylated (37Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Poletti A. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar). Human PR contains 15 of these sequences, several of which have already been identified as phosphorylation sites (15Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We were particularly interested in determining whether the conserved Ser-Pro in the hinge region between the hormone and DNA binding domains is phosphorylated as has been described for chicken PR (37Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse estrogen receptor (39Lahooti H. White R. Hoare S.A. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and human androgen receptors (26Zhou Z.X. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 605-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial analyses by Sheridan et al. had suggested that this site is not phosphorylated in human PR (13Sheridan P.L. Evans R.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6520-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arg-Pro and Lys-Pro motifs are not efficiently cleaved by trypsin (40Allen G. Work T.S. Burdon R.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1981: 43-71Google Scholar), and PR has an unusually large number of these sequences. Analyses of candidate Ser-Pro phosphorylation sites including Ser676 in the hinge region reveal that many are located within peptides bounded by these highly resistant cleavage sites. If left uncleaved, these phosphopeptides will be very large and difficult to recover by HPLC using a C18reversed-phase column. Using trypsin modified by reductive alkylation, which has decreased susceptibility to autolysis, we have increased the percentage cleavage at these problematic sites, allowing resolution of new phosphopeptides both in PR phosphorylated in vitro by Cdk2 and by mass spectrometry of phosphopeptides isolated from PR expressed in Sf9 cells. Here we describe the identification of six candidate phosphorylation sites identified either in in vitro phosphorylation experiments using Cdk2 or by mass spectrometry of peptides derived from PR expressed in Sf9 cells. These sites include Ser676 in the hinge region, which was identified as both anin vitro Cdk2 site and by mass spectrometry. Three additional sites, common to PR-A and PR-B, and two sites unique to the PR-B form have also been found. Finally, an additional site has been localized to a region between amino acids 107 and 159 in the portion of the receptor unique to PR-B. These studies suggest that most, if not all, of the Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in PR are phosphorylated. Phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Radioinert R5020 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [32P]H3PO4 and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from ICN (Irvine, CA). For affinity purification, nickel-NTA resin was purchased from Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA), and glutathione-Sepharose 4B and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rabbit anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(South San Francisco, CA). Phenylisothiocyanate and HPLC grade solvents were purchased from J. T. Baker Inc. Sequencing grade-modified trypsin was bought from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The endoproteinases Asp-N, Glu-C, Arg-C, and Lys-C were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For manual Edman degradation, triethylamine and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Sigma, and the Sequelon-AA reagent kit was purchased from Millipore Corp. (Milford, MA). TLC plates from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ), ninhydrin from Pierce, and phosphoamino acids (phosphoserine, phosphotyrosine, and phosphothreonine) from Sigma were used for the phosphoamino acid analysis. Infection of Sf9 insect cells with baculovirus encoding His tag PR-B or PR-A and treatment with 200 nm R5020 was performed as previously described (41Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Cells from a 500-ml culture were centrifuged to harvest, and pellets were stored at −80 °C until use. Cells were thawed and homogenized in a glass-Teflon homogenizer in 20 ml of His tag homogenization buffer (HHB; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, 1 mmB-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) plus 50 mm NaF and a mixture of protease inhibitors (18Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Ni2+-NTA resin (2 ml packed) was washed in HHB twice and resuspended to 40 ml. The Sf9 extract was then added to the resin and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in a 50-ml conical tube on a rocking platform. The resin was centrifuged and washed with HHB twice before transferring the resin suspension to a 3-ml column. The resin was washed with 30 ml of HHB followed by 30 ml of HHB containing 0.6 m NaCl. Finally, the column was washed with 10 ml of low salt HHB (NaCl concentration reduced to 50 mm in HHB). His tag PR was eluted in elution buffer (low salt HHB containing 250 mm imidazole) and collected as 1-ml fractions. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Estimated purity from silver staining of samples run on SDS gels was greater than 95%. This purification was performed essentially as described previously (42Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5234) Google Scholar). In brief, Sf9 cells were infected with the baculoviruses encoding HA-Cdk2 and glutathioneS-transferase-cyclin A at a 1:1 ratio for 40 h at 27 °C. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm. The pellet was then resuspended in 2 volumes of NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The extract was prepared by sonication and cleared by centrifugation. Five volumes of kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 mm ATP were added to the extract and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Glutathione-Sepharose was then added to the lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with NETN and then with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl. To elute the active Cdk2-cyclin A complex, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl and 40 mm glutathione was added to the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant containing the kinase complex was removed, and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. Purified recombinant His tag PR-A or PR-B (1 μg) was incubated with 5–10 μl of purified Cdk2-cyclin A and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (37,000 cpm/pmol) in Cdk2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) in a final volume of 40 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4× SDS-Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The phosphorylated bands corresponding to PR, visualized by autoradiography, were excised and digested with trypsin. Sequencing grade trypsin modified by reductive alkylation to prevent autolysis (Promega) was reconstituted in acetic acid as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Two μg of trypsin were added to each tube containing a gel slice prepared as described previously (15Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 1 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, and incubated overnight at 37 °C on a rotating platform. The tryptic digest was dried in a SpeedVac Concentrator® (Savant, Farmingdale, NY), and the phosphopeptides were separated on a C18 reversed-phase column using a Beckman System Gold HPLC. A linear 0–45% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was run for 90 min followed by an increase to 100% acetonitrile by 110 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The phosphopeptide peaks were detected using an online radioactive flow detector as described previously. 2-ml fractions were collected, counted by Cerenkov counting, split for analysis, and dried in a SpeedVac. To determine the cycle or position of the phosphoamino acid in the peptide, manual Edman degradation was performed as previously described (43Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using the Sequelon-AA Reagent kit. Briefly, the tryptic phosphopeptides were covalently coupled to Sequelon disks and subjected to Edman degradation. Each “cycle” of Edman degradation begins by modifying the first NH2-terminal amino acid of the peptide, which destabilizes the first peptide bond. Treatment with trifluoroacetic acid cleaves this bond and releases the amino acid from the disc. Cerenkov counting of the supernatant measures the amount of 32P released. The disc was then subjected to additional cycles of Edman degradation. Cleavage by the endoproteinases Asp-N, Glu-C, Arg-C, and Lys-C was used to further characterize the phosphopeptides. For Asp-N digestion, the sample was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated with 0.2 μg of Asp-N for 8 h at 37 °C. Glu-C digestion was performed with 1 μg of Glu-C in 25 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, for 8 h at 30 °C. The typical Arg-C digest was performed by dissolving the dried peptides in 85 μl of incubation buffer, adding 10 μl of activation solution (provided by the manufacturer) and 5 μl (or 0.5 μg) of Arg-C, and incubating for 12 h at 37 °C. For Lys-C, the sample was redissolved in 100 μl of digestion buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated with 0.2 μg of Lys-C at 37 °C for 12 h. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (44van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In brief, phosphopeptide samples containing 4 μg of each phosphoamino acid standard (phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine) were hydrolyzed in 6 mHCl and then dried in a SpeedVac. The sample was resuspended in pH 1.9 (2.5% (v/v) formic acid, 7.8% (v/v) acetic acid) buffer and spotted on a TLC plate, followed by electrophoresis for 24 min at 1500 V in the first dimension using a HTLE-7000 electrophoresis system (CBS Scientific). After the plate was dry, the plate was rotated 90o counterclockwise and electrophoresed in the second dimension in pH 3.5 buffer (5% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine) at 1300 V for 17 min. The negatively charged phosphoamino acids migrate toward the (+)-terminal during electrophoresis in both dimensions. The amino acid standards were visualized by spraying the plate with a 0.5% solution of ninhydrin in acetone. Phosphorylated amino acids were detected by autoradiography. T47D cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 106 cells in 75-cm2 T-flasks in 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Prior to labeling, the medium was replaced with serum-free phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1.5 h at 37 °C. [32P]H3PO4 (0.833 mCi/ml) was added to the phosphate-free medium, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. 2 h prior to harvest, the cells were treated with hormone at a final concentration of 10 nmR5020. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with calcium and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) was added to the flasks and allowed to incubate for 5 min. Cells were dislodged by shaking, and the suspension was pooled and transferred to 50-ml conical tubes. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm. Cell pellets were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then KPFM (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 12 mm monothioglycerol), with centrifugation between washes. To make whole-cell extract, the cells were suspended in KPFM containing 0.5 m NaCl plus a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (18Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and homogenized by 50 strokes in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were diluted 1:1 with KPFM buffer to reduce the salt concentration, transferred to Ti75 tubes, and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min. The extract supernatant was directly added to the prepared antibody-coupled Sepharose beads. Protein A-Sepharose was preswollen in water and washed with PBS. Per six-flask pool, 200 μl of bead suspension in PBS (3:1 beads/buffer) were incubated with 25 μg of rabbit anti-mouse for 4 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The beads were then washed twice with PBS. 40 μg (per six-flask pool) of the PR antibody 1294 (45Clemm D.L. Sherman L. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Schrader W.T. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was added to the bead suspension and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The antibody-conjugated beads were washed once with PBS and twice with TEG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). The cell extract was then added to the prepared beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The beads were washed once with TEG, three times with TEG containing 0.3m NaCl, and again with TEG by suspending in the indicated buffer followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm to remove nonspecific proteins. PR was extracted from the beads by heating at 100 °C in 1× SDS-sample buffer and loaded on a 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Labeled PR was detected by autoradiography. Purified His tag PR was dialyzed for 8 h against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate in a Tube-O-dialyzer (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). PR (40 μg) was digested with 1 μg each of trypsin, Asp-N, and Glu-C for 4 h at 37 °C. An additional 1 μg of each enzyme was added after 4 h, and incubation continued for an additional 4 h. The digest was then dried in a SpeedVac. FeNTA columns were prepared and used essentially as described (46Neville D.C. Rozanas C.R. Price E.M. Gruis D.B. Verkman A.S. Townsend R.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2436-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) by sequentially washing a 0.5-ml Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose column with 2 ml of H2O, 2 ml of 0.1 m EDTA, pH 7.4, 2 ml of H2O, 2 ml of 0.1 m HOAc, 2 ml of 0.1m ferric chloride in 0.1 m HOAc and 2 ml of 0.1m HOAc. Dried digests were dissolved in 0.1 mHOAc and loaded on the column. The column was sequentially washed with 2 ml of 0.1 m HOAc, 2 ml of H2O, and 2 ml of 0.1% ammonium acetate, pH 8.0. The phosphopeptides were eluted with 2 ml of 0.1% ammonium acetate, pH 9.5. Samples were desalted using C18 resin prior to analysis. Analyses were performed on a PE Sciex (Foster City, CA) API 3000 tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Protana (Odense, Denmark) nanoelectrospray source. The samples were dissolved in an aqueous solution of 50% methanol and 1% formic acid, and 2–3 μl were deposited in the gold/palladium-coated glass nanoelectrospray capillaries. The samples were analyzed for phosphorylated peptide identification using negative ion precursor ion scanning for m/z 79.1 with nitrogen as the collision gas and a collision energy of 100 eV. Positive ion full scanning spectra were then recorded utilizing the first quadrupole as the mass filter and a cone potential of 70 V. Product ion spectra of t"

Sequence analysis identified putative human homologues for exosome components, although several were found only as expressed sequence tags. Here we report the cloning of full-length cDNAs, which encode putative human homologues of the Rrp40p, Rrp41p, and Rrp46p components of the exosome. Recombinant proteins were expressed and used to raise rabbit antisera. In Western blotting experiments, these decorated HeLa cell proteins of the predicted sizes. All three human proteins were enriched in the HeLa cells nucleus and nucleolus, but were also clearly detected in the cytoplasm. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p were present in a large complex. This cofractionated with the human homologues of other exosome components, hRrp4p and PM/Scl-100. Anti-PM/Scl-positive patient sera coimmunoprecipitated hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p demon- strating their physical association. The immunoprecipitated complex exhibited 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease activity <i>in vitro</i>. hRrp41p was expressed in yeast and shown to suppress the lethality of genetic depletion of yeast Rrp41p. We conclude that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p represent novel components of the human exosome complex.AF281132 AF281134"
https://openalex.org/W1996797037,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 is an intracellular adapter protein, which, upon TNF stimulation, is directly recruited to the intracellular region of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) or indirectly, via TRADD, to the intracellular region of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, endogenous TRAF2 colocalizes with the membrane-organizing protein caveolin-1 at regions of enrichment subjacent to the plasma membrane as detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Both endogenous and transfected TRAF2 protein coimmunoprecipitate with caveolin-1 in the absence of ligand. Upon TNF treatment, the TRAF2-caveolin-1 complex transiently associates with TRADD, and upon overexpression of TNFR2, the TRAF2-caveolin-1 complex stably associates with and causes redistribution of this receptor as detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which have minimal endogenous expression of caveolin-1, cotransfection of TRAF2 and caveolin-1 results in spontaneous association of these proteins which can further associate with and redistribute transfected TNFR2 molecules. The association of caveolin-1 with TNFR2 depends upon TRAF2. Cotransfection of caveolin-1 protein increases TRAF2 protein expression levels in HEK 293 cells, which correlates with enhancement of TNF and TRAF2 signaling, measured as transcription of a NF-κB promoter-reporter gene, although the caveolin-enhanced response to TNF is attenuated at higher caveolin levels. These findings suggest that intracellular distribution of activated TNF receptors may be regulated by caveolin-1 via its interaction with TRAF2.

Upon TNF treatment, the TRAF2-caveolin-1 complex transiently associates with TRADD, and upon overexpression of TNFR2, the TRAF2-caveolin-1 complex stably associates with and causes redistribution of this receptor as detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which have minimal endogenous expression of caveolin-1, cotransfection of TRAF2 and caveolin-1 results in spontaneous association of these proteins which can further associate with and redistribute transfected TNFR2 molecules. The association of caveolin-1 with TNFR2 depends upon TRAF2. Cotransfection of caveolin-1 protein increases TRAF2 protein expression levels in HEK 293 cells, which correlates with enhancement of TNF and TRAF2 signaling, measured as transcription of a NF-κB promoter-reporter gene, although the caveolin-enhanced response to TNF is attenuated at higher caveolin levels. These findings suggest that intracellular distribution of activated TNF receptors may be regulated by caveolin-1 via its interaction with TRAF2. tumor necrosis factor tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2, respectively tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated death domain protein tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor receptor-interacting protein polymerase chain reaction green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein nuclear factor κB activator protein-1 human umbilical vein endothelial cell human embryonic kidney cell cytomegalovirus fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline TNF1 is a critical mediator of innate and adaptive immunity (1Beutler B.

Many receptor signaling pathways have been linked to cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-enriched invaginations of the plasma membrane called caveoli (17Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J.

The inner surface of these membrane regions is coated with a protein scaffolding formed by members of the caveolin family (caveolin-1, -2, and -3). Caveolins have also been associated with other membrane organelles, such as the Golgi, and they may play a role in localizing signaling molecules to these intracellular compartments (19Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Such an association has been observed for endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (called eNOS; also called NOS-3), which can exist association with either plasma membrane or Golgi (20Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Since TNFR1 can also reside either in the plasma membrane or in the Golgi of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (21Bradley J.R. Thiru S. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered if it too might associate with caveolin. Although we did not find a direct association of TNFR1 with caveolin, we did find an interaction of caveolin-1 with TRAF2. This association is independent of ligand and results in the recruitment of TRAF2-caveolin-1 complexes to either TRADD or TNFR2. -Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems Inc.

Texas Red® dye-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). All other reagents are from Bio-Rad or Sigma. cDNAs encoding mouse TRAF1, full-length human TRAF2, and a dominant-negative of human TRAF2 (TRAF2DN, which has 86 amino acids deleted from the N-terminal end) were each amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from mammalian expression constructs pRK-TRAF1-Flag and pRK-TRAF2-Flag (both gifts from Dr. V. Dixit, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The amplified cDNA fragments were directly inserted betweenBamHI and KpnI sites of the expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pBK-CMV-TRAF1, pBK-CMV-TRAF2, and pBK-CMV-TRAF2DN. To generate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion construct, the EGFP coding sequence minus its stop codon was first amplified from the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) using 5′-oligonucleotide primer 5′-GTGAACCGTCAGATCCGCTAG-3′ (based on the sequence of pEGFP-N1 from 575 to 595) and 3′ primer 5′-CCATCTTGCGCGCCTTGTACAGCTCGTTCCATGC-3′ (with the native sequence of pEGFP-N1 from 1376 to 1396 underlined). The PCR-amplified cDNA fragment, containing the EGFP cassette, was gel-purified, digested with BamHI and BssHII, and directly inserted between the BamHI and BssHII sites of plasmids pBK-CMV-TRAF1, pBK-CMV-TRAF2, or pBK-CMV-TRAF2DN (in which theBssHII site is located three base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon of TRAF1 or TRAF2). To make TNFR2(−16), TNFR2(−37), and TNFR2(−59), which are C-terminal deletion constructs of wild type TNFR2, nucleotides encoding 16, 37, and 59 amino acids, respectively, of the C-terminal end of TNFR2 were removed from the cDNA encoding the full-length receptor (in plasmid pRCX-3 (Ref. 22Gaeta, M. L., Johnson, D. R., Kluger, M. S., and Pober, J. S. (2001) Lab. Invest., in press.Google Scholar)) and a new stop codon was introduced by PCR. Each of the TNFR2s with C-terminal truncations was then directly inserted back into the same expression vector as the full-length cDNA.

Ghosh (Yale University). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HUVEC were isolated and serially cultured as described previously on gelatin (J. T. Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ)-coated tissue culture plastic (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) in Medium 199 supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 200 μml-glutamine (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), 100 μg/ml porcine heparin (Sigma), and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (from Life Technologies, Inc.) (23Thornton S.C. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. Science. 1983; 222: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of HUVEC was performed using a DEAE-dextran method as described previously (24Min W. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3508-3518PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of 60–80% and transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method with 1–12 μg of plasmid (25Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of control or transfected cells was conducted as follows. Cell monolayers were washed with cold PBS and solubilized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation in Eppendorf tubes, then precleared with Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads with rocking for 1 h at 4 °C. 5 μg of the specific antibody was added to the precleared lysates for 2–16 h at 4 °C, Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads were used to absorb immunoprecipitates with rocking for 1–8 h at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk (Nestle Food Co., Glendale, CA), probed with specific antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti mouse or rabbit antibody (1:10000 dilution) and exposed using the Supersignal® West Femto Chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Pierce). Transfected cells were seeded on human plasma fibronectin- or collagen type I (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips placed in six-well culture dishes at a density of 5 × 105cells/well for HEK 293 and 2.5 × 105 cells/well for HUVEC. The cells were then rinsed briefly in PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. After 1 h of incubation with specific antibody, the cells were washed and incubated with Texas Red® dye-conjugated donkey or swine anti-rabbit lgG, and/or FITC-conjugated donkey or goat anti-mouse lgG (1:100 dilution) for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides, and immunofluorescence was observed with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning microscope at 568 and 488 nm excitation, respectively. Cell lysates of reporter gene-transfected cells were prepared and assayed using PromegaDual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicate using a Berthold (Schwarzwald, Germany) model LB9501 luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activity of the NF-κB promoter-firefly luciferase reporter was normalized to the activity of the cytokine-unresponsive β-actin promoter Renilla luciferase reporter. Our first approach to study the role of caveolin-1 in the TNF signaling pathway was to examine HUVEC cell lysates for an association of caveolin-1 with various signaling molecules by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. We did not observe an association of caveolin-1 with TNFR1, TRADD, or TNFR2 (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 1 A, caveolin-1 protein was found in immunoprecipitates of TRAF2 by immunoblotting, but not in mock immunoprecipitates using control serum. (A much smaller amount of caveolin-1 was seen at long exposures in the absence of specific antibody, consistent with a weak nonspecific association.) Furthermore, immunoprecipitates of caveolin-1 contained TRAF2 as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of the cells with TNF prior to lysis did not affect the TRAF2-caveolin association, but did cause the TRAF2-caveolin-1 complex to transiently associate with TRADD (maximal 5 min). Interestingly, this time course is consistent with previous studies of HUVEC which demonstrated formation of a transient TNF-induced complex at the plasma membrane containing TNFR1, TRADD, and TRAF2 (26Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Galbraith J. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar, 27Madge L.A. Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13643-13649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We next turned to confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm these biochemical findings. Both TRAF2 and caveolin-1 are diffusely present throughout the cytoplasm of HUVEC (Fig.2), limiting any conclusions that may be drawn regarding association. However, in many (but not all) cells, caveolin-1 is focally enriched in regions located subjacent to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B). Such regions are more common when the cultures reach confluence. Interestingly, TRAF2 is also enriched within these same regions (Fig. 2, A and C), supporting our immunoprecipitation results of an associate between TRAF2 and caveolin-1. We did not observe any redistribution of TRAF2 or caveolin-1 induced by TNF treatment (data not shown). To further explore the interaction of TRAF2 and caveolin-1, we turned to HEK 293 cells, which contain a little endogenous caveolin-1 compared with the level found in HUVEC (Fig. 1 C). In these experiments, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with Flag-tagged TRAF2 and caveolin-1, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag and then immunoblotted. As shown in Fig.1 D, exogenous caveolin-1 was readily detected in the immunocomplex precipitated from the cell lysates expressing both Flag-tagged TRAF2 and caveolin-1. Only a small amount of caveolin-1 was found in the anti-Flag immunocomplex prepared from cells transfected with caveolin-1 only, again attributable to the intrinsic stickiness of this protein. These results strongly support the findings first made in HUVEC that TRAF2 associates with caveolin-1 prior to ligand signaling. We again employed fluorescence confocal microscopy to confirm the results observed by immunoprecipitation. HEK 293 cells were transfected with GFP-TRAF2 alone or, were cotransfected with caveolin-1 and GFP-TRAF2. As shown in Fig. 3, GFP-TRAF2 alone exhibited diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.3 A) (28Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is not detectable in HEK 293 cells by immunofluorescence in the absence of transfection with this protein. Transfection of caveolin-1 alone showed diffuse cytosolic staining (data not shown). Cotransfection of caveolin-1 and GFP-TRAF2 induced a redistribution of TRAF2 into a punctuate pattern (Fig. 3 B). To explore the specificity of this interaction, we transfected HEK 293 cells with TRAF1 instead of TRAF2. Transfection with GFP-TRAF1 alone, like GFP-TRAF2, resulted in diffused cytosolic fluorescence (Fig.3 C). However, in this case, caveolin-1 did not cause a redistribution of GFP-TRAF1 (Fig. 3 D). To further explore the effects of TNF receptor signaling, we examined HUVEC transfected with GFP-TRAF2 and TNF receptors. In single transfected cells, GFP-TRAF2 was evenly distributed throughout cytoplasm. Once again, endogenous caveolin-1 was also observed to be diffusely expressed, except where it sometimes coalesced along regions of the plasma membrane to form a characteristic “patch” pattern (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to our findings with endogenous TRAF2, the GFP-TRAF2 signal was too bright to observe enrichment of the patch regions. We also treated the single transfected cells with TNF, but this treatment did not cause any obvious redistribution of GFP-TRAF2 or of caveolin-1 (data not shown), similar to our findings with endogenous TRAF2. We then proceeded to overexpress TNF receptors in the same cells. We have reported previously that transfected TNFR1 does not escape from the Golgi apparatus and desensitizes cell signaling (22Gaeta, M. L., Johnson, D. R., Kluger, M. S., and Pober, J. S. (2001) Lab. Invest., in press.Google Scholar). In contrast, TNFR2 is readily expressed at the plasma membrane and does not desensitize signaling. Therefore, we overexpressed TNFR2 receptor in the GFP-TRAF2-expressing HUVEC. This maneuver causes ligand-independent receptor clustering and stable recruitment of TRAF2 to the clustered receptors (Fig.4). Specifically, in cells transfected only with TNFR2, the receptor localized to the perinuclear region (probably Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum) as well as the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 B), and isolated receptor did not show significant overlap with caveolin-1 expression. In HUVEC cells transfected with GFP-TRAF2 and Flag-TNFR2, GFP-TRAF2 fluorescence was both redistributed to plasma membrane and clustered into a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm that was largely coincident with that of transfected TNFR2 stained with antibody to Flag (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, when the cells cotransfected both with GFP-TRAF2 and TNFR2 were stained with antibody to caveolin-1, the subcellular localization of GFP-TRAF2 was now clearly colocalized with that of caveolin-1 (Fig. 4 D), indicating that both TRAF2 and caveolin-1 were corecruited to the TNFR2 receptor. In other words, the redistribution of TRAF2 induced by overexpressed TNFR2 allowed a clear demonstration of corecruitment of caveolin-1 to the activated TNF receptor in HUVEC. The association of TNFR2, TRAF2, and caveolin-1 observed in HUVEC cells was also detected in HEK 293 cells by immunofluorescence (data not shown) and further analyzed by immunoprecipitation (Fig.5). In these experiments, Flag-tagged TNFR2 and caveolin-1 were coexpressed with or without GFP-TRAF2. In the presence of TRAF2, TNFR2 was found to significantly associate with caveolin-1 (Fig. 5, lane 4), whereas, in the absence of TRAF2, much less interaction of TNFR2 with caveolin-1 was detected (Fig. 5, lane 3). These findings strongly suggest that the interaction of TNFR2 with caveolin-1 is mediated via TRAF2. The role of TRAF2 in linking caveolin-1 to TNFR2 was further supported by a mutational analysis of the TRAF2 binding region on the C-terminal region of TNFR2. To do this, we made a series of Flag-tagged TNFR2 proteins in which deletions were constructed by removing different numbers of amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of the receptor (Fig. 6 A). These C-terminal deletions had no significant effect on intracellular distribution of the receptors, all of which localized both to plasma membrane and to cytoplasm concentrated in the perinuclear area (data not shown). The capacity of TNFR2 mutants to interact with TRAF2 was then examined by cotransfection of GFP-TRAF2 with individual wild type or mutant TNFR2 molecules (Fig. 6 B). Like wild type TNFR2, coexpression of TNFR2(−16) with TRAF2 caused a redistribution of TRAF2, consistent with the fact that TNFR2(−16) retains the TRAF2 binding region (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, TRAF2 remained evenly distributed in the cells in which TNFR2(−37) or TNFR2(−59) was expressed, indicating that loss of the ability of TNFR2(−37) and TNFR2(−59) to associate with TRAF2 (Fig. 6,D and E). Analysis of the same transfectants by indirect immunofluorescence showed that caveolin-1 was only redistributed by TNFR2 molecules (wild type and TNFR2(−16)), which are capable of interacting with TRAF2 (Fig.7, A and B). In contrast, the distribution of caveolin-1 in cells transfected with TNFR2(−37) or TNFR2(−59) did not show any receptor association (Fig.7, C and D). Similar results were also found in HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with GFP-TRAF2, caveolin-1, and different Flag-tagged TNFR2 and its deletion mutants (data not shown). Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRAF2 binding to activated TNFRs results in corecruitment of caveolin-1 into the receptor complex.Figure 6Subcellular localization of GFP-tagged TRAF2 in HUVEC transfected with wild type TNFR2 and its deletion mutants.

Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 15Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), a possible functional linkage between interaction of TRAF2 and caveolin-1 and TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation was investigated. First, protein levels of GFP-TRAF2 in HEK 293 cells cotransfected with a constant amount of GFP-TRAF2 cDNA and varying amounts of caveolin-1 cDNA were examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 8). Under the condition of equal protein loading, the amount of TRAF2 protein was significantly increased by coexpression of caveolin-1 in a dose-dependent manner, even though the amount of cDNA encoding TRAF2 was held constant. In a final series of experiments, we examined the influence of caveolin-1 expression on TNF induced NF-κB activation in HEK 293 using a NF-κB promoter luciferase-based reporter system. At a suboptimal concentration of TNF (1 ng/ml), the effect of caveolin-1 on activation of NF-κB was biphasic, being initially augmented by increasing expression of caveolin-1 and then decreased at the highest level of transfected caveolin cDNA. The peak of this enhancement was about 2–3-fold over the cells not expressing exogenous caveolin-1 (Fig.9 A). At supra-optimal TNF concentrations (100 ng/ml), the effect of caveolin-1 was no longer observed (data not shown). However, the enhancement of TNF-induced NF-κB activity was mimicked by ligand-independent increases of NF-κB activity triggered by overexpression of TRAF2, but not with an inactive form of TRAF2 (TRAF2DN) (Fig. 9 B). In this case, increasing caveolin-1 simply increased TRAF2 signaling without showing a diminution at higher levels. Thus the interaction of caveolin-1 with TRAF2 can potentiate TNF signaling mediated by TRAF2. It seems likely that this effect is explained by the increased level of TRAF2 protein observed in the presence of caveolin-1.Figure 9Effect of expression of caveolin-1 in HEK 293 on NF-κB reporter activity. A, TNF-induced NF-κB reporter activity was measured in HEK 293 cells transfected transiently with 0.5 μg of pBIIXLuc and 0.1 μg of pβ-actin-Rluc together with increased amount of pBC-caveolin-1 (0, 1, 2, and 3 μg, respectively). Then the transfected cells were divided into two replicate cultures. One culture was stimulated with 1 ng/ml TNF, whereas the other culture remained unstimulated.

We demonstrate the association between endogenous TRAF2 and caveolin-1 in HUVEC and extend these findings using transfected proteins in HUVEC and HEK 293 cells. These proteins are associated in unstimulated HUVEC or in cotrasfected HEK 293. Upon receptor activation, either by TNF induction or by receptor overexpression, caveolin-1 is recruited to the receptor signaling complex through its interaction with TRAF2. TRAF2 belongs to a family of adapter proteins including TRAF1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 (29Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp.

These proteins link clustering of receptors belonging to the TNF receptor family and to the Toll/IL-1 receptor family to downstream signaling events such as activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. The sequences and in some cases, the partial three-dimensional structure of TRAF proteins have been solved (10Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 has been observed to bind to various target proteins through consensus binding sequences ØXØXXXXØ and ØXXXXØXXØ, where Ø is aromatic amino acid Trp, Phe, or Tyr (37Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of TRAF2 obtains a possible caveolin binding motif within its conserved TRAF domain (Phe 354-Ile-Trp-Lys-Ile-Ser-Asp-Phe 361). A similar sequence is present in TRAF6, but not in TRAF1. This may explain why TRAF1, which we used as a specificity control for caveolin-1 association, did not interact with caveolin-1 in cotransfected HEK 293 cells. Substitution of this putative caveolin binding site of TRAF2 with the nonfunctional sequence from TRAF1 appears to reduce but not eliminate the association with caveolin-1. 2X. Feng and J. S. Pober, unpublished observations. Therefore, although this sequence may contribute to caveolin-1 association, it does not appear to fully account for it. Furthermore, the binding site is located within a region that is near the contact region of TRAF2 with the receptor (35Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and it is not clear whether caveolin-1 binding to this site and receptor binding are simultaneously possible. Our findings, which establish a biochemical protein-protein association, raise a number of questions about the functional implication of caveolin-1 binding to TRAF2. TRAF2 signaling may be terminated, in some systems, by TRAF2 degradation (38Duckett C.S. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2810-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39Weiss T. Grell M. Siemienski K. Muhlenbeck F. Durkop H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3136-3142PubMed Google Scholar). In transfected HEK 293 cells, the presence of caveolin-1 increases TRAF2 expression levels. This effect could be due to TRAF2 protein stabilization by prevention of degradation. If true, then caveolin-1 binding to TRAF2 could prolong TNF signaling. We did observe a significant enhancement of TNF signaling in the presence of caveolin-1, but the effect was decreased at the higher levels of caveolin-1 expression and was not seen at supra-optimal TNF concentrations. In any event, caveolin-1 is not required for TRAF2 signaling since TRAF2 overexpression can activate a NF-κB reporter gene in the absence of significant caveolin expression (e.g. in transfected HEK 293 cells). We do not know if caveolin-1 plays a role in TNF-mediated apoptosis since HEK 293 cells cannot be killed by TNF whether or not caveolin-1 is present. 3L. A. Madge and J. S. Pober, unpublished observations. An effect on apoptosis seems unlikely in any event since TRAF2 is not involved in the TNF-activated death pathway (9Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Overall, our data suggest that caveolin-1 may modulate TRAF2-mediated signaling, but it is not essential for TNF responses. A more likely role for the association of caveolin-1 and TRAF2 is the targeting of activated TNF receptor complexes to caveolin-enriched membrane compartments such as caveoli. Many other receptor systems appear to localize to caveoli, which are defined by their cholesterol- and sphingomyelin- enriched lipid environments as well as by their morphological features (18Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). This microenvironment may alter the efficiency or receptor signaling and may be uniquely suited to allow cross-regulation by different types of hormone and cytokine receptors. If caveolin functions to recruit activated TNF receptors to a specific signaling environment, then excess free caveolin may inhibit TNF receptor recruitment to caveoli or related structures. This may explain why high levels of transfected caveolin-1 decreases ligand-induced responses but not signals caused by overexpression of TRAF2. It may also explain why TNF addition fails to cause a redistribution of TRAF2 molecules within the cell, i.e. it is the receptor rather than the TRAF molecule that is redistributed by ligand binding. To date, there are no reports that TNF-induced transcription requires the microenvironment of the caveoli, but TNF induced apoptosis in U937 cells have been reported to be initiated in caveoli-like regions (40Ko Y.G. Lee J.S. Kang Y.S. Ahn J.H. Seo J.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7217-7223PubMed Google Scholar). As we have noted above, TRAF2 has not been implicated in TNF-induced apoptosis (9Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) and may in fact inhibit through the induced expression of antiapoptotic proteins and through the recruitment of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins to the receptor complex (13Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 15Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Activated TNF receptors are rapidly removed from the membrane by endocytosis, but this is thought to involve clathrin-coated pits and vesicles rather than caveoli (21Bradley J.R. Thiru S. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to determine whether caveolin-1 alters this pattern of receptor transport. In summary, we have made the unexpected finding that the TNF signaling adapter protein TRAF2 exists in a complex with caveolin-1, allowing caveolin-1 to be recruited into activated receptor signaling complexes. The functional significance of this finding is unclear, and may relate to TRAF2 stabilization and/or to targeting of activated receptors within the cells. Indeed, our results may suggest that from a cell biology perspective, it is more accurate to describe the recruitment of ligand-receptor complexes to TRAF2-caveollin-1 binding sites than it is to describe the recruitment of TRAF2 to the occupied receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2077806351,"Aberrant regulation of CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein, has been implicated in the growth and metastasis of numerous tumors. Although both CD44 overexpression and loss have been implicated in tumor progression, the mechanism of CD44 down-regulation in these tumor types is not known. By immunoblot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis we determined that a cervical carcinoma cell line, C33A, lacks CD44 expression. To determine how CD44 is down-regulated in C33A cells, we utilized cell fusions of C33A cells with a CD44-expressing cell line (SAOS-2). We found that SAOS-2 fusion restored CD44 expression in C33A cells, suggesting that a trans-acting factor present in SAOS-2 cells promotes CD44 production. C33A cells are BRG-1-deficient, and we found that CD44 was absent in another BRG-1-deficient tumor cell line, indicating that loss of BRG-1 may be a general mechanism by which cells lose CD44. Reintroduction of BRG-1 into these cells restored CD44 expression. Furthermore, disruption of BRG-1 function through the use of dominant-negative BRG-1 demonstrated the requirement of BRG-1 in CD44 regulation. Finally, we show that Cyclin E overexpression resulted in the attenuation of CD44 stimulation, which is consistent with previous observations that Cyclin E can abrogate BRG-1 action. Taken together, these results suggest that BRG-1 is a critical regulator of CD44 expression, thus implicating SWI/SNF components in the regulation of cellular adhesion and metastasis.

Many tumors express higher than normal levels of total CD44 protein as well as splice variants that do not occur in normal cells (1Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv.

Ectopic expression of some forms of CD44 can enhance metastasis and tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo (5Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zoller M. Haussmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A.

These findings suggest that CD44 might be regulated by environmental or genetic factors that have been shown to contribute to cancer progression. The expression of activated oncogenes like v-Ras, v-Src, and v-Fos, which promote transformation and invasion, have been reported to induce CD44 expression (8Hofmann M. Rudy W. Gunthert U.

In contrast to studies that correlate CD44 overexpression with cancer progression, a significant number of reports also indicate that loss of CD44 expression can contribute to tumorigenesis (12Goodison S.

Specifically, it has been shown that loss of CD44 in cervical carcinomas, neuroblastomas, prostate carcinomas, melanomas, and small cell lung carcinomas correlates with increased aggressiveness of these tumors (13Kohlberger P.D.

It has been hypothesized that loss of CD44 may facilitate the abrogation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in some tumors, leading to a more metastatic phenotype (4Herrlich P. Morrison H.

In the present study, we have identified theBrahma-related gene, BRG-1,1 as a critical regulator of CD44 expression. BRG-1 is a component of the SWI/SNF complex that regulates gene transcription through ATPase-dependent remodeling of chromatin (18Meraldi P. Lukas J. Fry A.M. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. Nat.

We demonstrate that loss of BRG-1 correlates with a lack of CD44 expression in several cell lines. Reintroduction of BRG-1 restored expression of CD44 in BRG-1-deficient cells, suggesting that BRG-1 regulates basal CD44 levels. Moreover, we show that functional BRG-1 is required for stimulating CD44, because dominant-negative BRG-1 inhibits CD44 production. In addition, we show that Cyclin E can antagonize BRG-1 regulation of CD44. As such, this report provides the first evidence that the SWI/SNF complex regulates genes involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis and suggests that BRG-1 loss in human tumors contributes to the formation of a metastatic phenotype.

Wang, University of California at San Diego, 851 polyclonal antibody), and anti-BRG-1 (Dr. Weidong Wang, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD). The blots were then incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody-antigen complex was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The levels of Cdk4 and CD44 were quantitated using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min and then either permeabilized (PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for p53 staining or directly blocked with 5% normal goat serum for CD44 staining. The p53 antibody (1:100 dilution, ab-6, Calbiochem) was detected with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Human CD44 was probed with Hermes 3 (1:25, monoclonal antibody) and detected with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Mouse CD44 was identified with IM7 (1:100,Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and visualized with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat antibody. To analyze CD44 mRNA expression levels, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed. First, ∼1 × 106 C33A cells were seeded into a 10-cm dish and transfected with either Vector-, PSM-RB-, or BRG-1-encoding plasmids along with pBabe. After 48 h of selection with puromycin, total mRNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNAs were then synthesized using ∼1 μg of isolated total mRNA and the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. To amplify human CD44, cDNAs were subjected to PCR using the forward primer: 5′-CAGACCTGCCCAATGCCTTTGATGGACC-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-CAAAGCCAAGGCCAAGAGGGATGCC-3′. As a control, human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was amplified using the forward primer: 5′-GGTCATCAATGGGAAACCCATCAC-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-ACAAACTCTGCTACTTCTGG-3′. PCR was performed with the following conditions: 94 °C, 1 min; 62 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 2.5 min, for 30 cycles. Approximately 10 μl of the PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. The PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and then photographed. The levels of GAPDH and CD44 were quantitated using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) from two independent PCR reactions. CD44 is lost some in cervical carcinomas, and this loss correlates with increased metastatic potential (13Kohlberger P.D. Kieback D.G. Bancher D. Stickeler E. Heinzl H. Gitsch G. Breitenecker G. Kainz C. Gynecol. Oncol. 1997; 66: 227-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Saegusa M. Hashimura M. Machida D. Okayasu I. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We identified a human cervical carcinoma cell line, C33A, which demonstrates loss of CD44 expression as determined by immunoblot analysis with a CD44-specific antibody (Fig.1 A, lane 1). By contrast, the osteogenic sarcoma cell line, SAOS-2, readily expresses detectable CD44 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Blotting for Cdk4 showed that equal total protein was loaded (Fig. 1 A). To examine whether loss of CD44 expression in C33A occurred at the RNA level, RT-PCR analysis was used to examine the levels of CD44 mRNA in C33A cells versus the CD44-positive SAOS-2 cells. In C33A cells, the levels of CD44 mRNA were ∼20-fold less than that found in SAOS-2 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3, 4,5, and 6). Thus, CD44 expression in C33A is lost at the level of RNA, suggesting that C33A cells either possess a factor important for repressing CD44 expression or alternatively lack a factor required for stimulating CD44 expression. To examine the underlying difference in CD44 signaling between C33A and SAOS-2, we utilized C33A-SAOS-2 (C-S) cell fusion lines that have been previously characterized (32Strobeck M.W. Fribourg A.F. Puga A. Knudsen E.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1857-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Four independent C-S fusion clones (#1–4) exhibited robust expression of CD44 comparable to that observed in parental SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–6). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that CD44 expression was restored and appropriately localized in the cell fusions (Fig.2 B, right panel). As a control, p53 staining confirmed that the fusion expressed p53 protein (contributed from C33A nuclei), because SAOS-2 are p53-negative (Fig. 2 B,left and middle panel). These findings suggest that C33A cells lack a factor(s) required for CD44 signaling, which is restored after nuclear fusion with SAOS-2. A known difference between SAOS-2 cells and C33A cells is that SAOS-2 cells express BRG-1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex involved in both gene regulation and chromatin remodeling, whereas C33A lack BRG-1 (36Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To examine whether loss of BRG-1 correlated with lack of CD44 expression, we analyzed several tumor lines that were either positive or negative for BRG-1 expression. Immunoblot analysis revealed that those tumor lines that were positive for BRG-1 were also positive for CD44 expression (Fig. 3 A,upper and middle panel, lanes 2,3, 5, 6, and 7). However, the SW13 adenocarcinoma cell line, which is BRG-1-negative, was deficient in CD44 protein expression, similar to that observed in C33A cells (Fig. 3 A, upper and middle panel, lanes 1 and 4) (36Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). As a control, the detection of actin shows the relative amount of protein loaded per lane (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, lanes 1–7). These data demonstrate that loss of BRG-1 correlates with a lack of CD44 protein, suggesting that BRG-1 is required for CD44 expression. To determine whether BRG-1 is sufficient to induce CD44 expression, BRG-1 was restored in BRG-1-negative (C33A and SW13) cells. C33A and SW13 cells were cotransfected with vector, a phosphorylation site mutant of RB (PSM-RB) as controls, or BRG-1 along with a puromycin resistance plasmid (pBabe-Puro). After selecting the transfected cells with puromycin, cells were harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In C33A and SW13 cells, transfection of either vector or PSM-RB did not alter CD44 levels. However, ectopic expression of BRG-1 caused a significant increase in CD44 protein levels (Fig.4 A, upper panel,lanes 1–6). Immunoblotting for BRG-1 and PSM-RB confirmed their expression in C33A and SW13 cells, whereas Cdk4 levels indicate that equal total protein was loaded per lane (Fig. 4 A,middle and lower panels, lanes 1–6). Because RB has been shown to recruit BRG-1 for transcriptional repression, we also examined whether expression of PSM-RB could alter BRG-1 stimulation of CD44. To test this, we cotransfected PSM-RB with BRG-1 into C33A cells and found that PSM-RB did not alter the ability of BRG-1 to modulate CD44 production (data not shown). Because BRG-1 is known to mediate its function through transcriptional regulation, we investigated whether BRG-1 stimulates CD44 mRNA levels (37Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). C33A cells were transfected with either vector or PSM-RB along with pBabe-Puro and selected in puromycin. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the level of CD44 mRNA quantitated from vector-transfected cells was equal to that of PSM-RB-transfected cells after normalization to GAPDH (Fig. 4 B, upper andlower panels, lanes 4, 5,8, and 9). In contrast, C33A cells transfected with BRG-1 showed an ∼40-fold induction in CD44 mRNA when compared with that of vector- or PSM-RB-transfected cells and normalized against GAPDH (Fig. 4 B, upper andlower panels, lanes 4–9). PCR analysis of the RNA prior to reverse transcribing revealed no amplification, thus eliminating the possibility of DNA contamination (Fig. 4 B,upper and lower panels, lanes 1–3). The effect of ectopic BRG-1 expression on the CD44 promoter was assessed by reporter analysis in transient transfection assays. Ectopic expression of BRG-1 did not stimulate CD44 reporter activity, and high basal activity of the reporter was observed in cells either expressing or deficient in BRG-1 (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the idea that BRG-1 stimulates transcription through the remodeling of chromatin, because we show that BRG-1 clearly stimulates the expression of endogenous CD44 RNA and protein. Because the data presented imply that BRG-1 may have a role in maintaining the production of CD44, we investigated whether BRG-1 is required for this process. To test this we utilized an NIH3T3 cell line, called BO5-1, that inducibly expresses dominant-negative BRG-1 (dnBRG-1) (28de La Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The mutant BRG-1 protein that is induced in BO5-1 cells contains a mutation in the ATP-binding site that renders it catalytically inactive, and in the presence of tetracycline, BO5-1 cells fail to demonstrate detectable levels of dnBRG-1 (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and2). However, after incubation in the absence of tetracycline for 72 h, a strong induction of dnBRG-1 was observed. Immunostaining of the BO5-1 cells grown in the absence of tetracycline revealed that expression of dnBRG-1 results in the reduction of CD44 expression when compared with uninduced BO5-1 cells (Fig.5 B). Microscopic analysis revealed that expression of dnBRG-1 significantly inhibits CD44 staining in ∼90% of induced cells when compared with BO5-1 cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 5 C). These data imply that functional BRG-1 is required for stimulating CD44 expression. It has been previously reported that Cyclin E can bind to and antagonize the ability of BRG-1 to induce growth arrest (38Shanahan F. Seghezzi W. Parry D. Mahony D. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1460-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Based on this, and the findings that Cyclin E is also overexpressed in tumors, we examined whether expression of Cyclin E could disrupt the ability of BRG-1 to signal to CD44 (39Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). To test this, C33A cells were cotransfected with vector, BRG-1, or BRG-1 and Cyclin E together with pBabe-Puro. After rapid puromycin selection the cells were harvested and analyzed for CD44 expression via immunoblotting. As expected, ectopic expression of BRG-1 in C33A stimulated CD44 expression when compared with vector (Fig. 6, upper panel,lanes 1 and 2). However, when Cyclin E was cotransfected with BRG-1 in two independent transfections, CD44 expression was inhibited by ∼62% as determined after normalization to Cdk4 (Fig. 6, upper and lower panels,lanes 1, 3, and 4). Immunoblotting for BRG-1 and Cyclin E confirms their expression while Cdk4 levels were monitored as a loading control (Fig. 6, middle andlower panels, lanes 1–4). These findings show that Cyclin E can antagonize the ability of BRG-1 to stimulate CD44 production. Aberrant expression of CD44 is associated with advanced tumor progression and poor clinical outcome (1Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goodison S. Urquidi V. Tarin D. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 52: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 3Sherman L. Sleeman J. Dall P. Hekele A. Moll J. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 249-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, little is known about what factors are required for maintaining CD44 expression. Here we show that BRG-1 plays a critical role in regulating CD44 transcription. Reintroduction of BRG-1 restored CD44 expression in BRG-1-negative (C33A and SW13) cells, whereas expression of dominant-negative BRG-1 in NIH3T3 cells inhibited CD44 production. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Cyclin E inhibited the ability of BRG-1 to stimulate CD44, consistent with the notion that at least some components of the cell cycle machinery could also mediate CD44 expression. These results indicate that BRG-1 is required for regulating CD44 expression, suggesting that loss of BRG-1 may contribute to the invasive and metastatic potential of certain cancers. BRG-1 plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling and can both stimulate and repress the transcription of specific genes (22Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1857-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). BRG-1 is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that regulates transcription through its ability to modify nucleosome structure (37Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Activation of CD44 expression is apparently dependent on chromatin remodeling, because the dominant-negative BRG-1 used in this study specifically disrupts the ATPase activity of BRG-1. In the case of CD44, BRG-1 likely converts the CD44 promoter from a transcriptionally inactive state to an active one. The finding that transiently transfected CD44 reporter constructs maintained high basal activity in the absence of BRG-1 suggests that the plasmid-borne CD44 promoter construct already exists in a transcriptionally active state, thus masking any BRG-1 stimulatory effect at the level of chromatin (data not shown). The loss of CD44 expression by some tumors correlates with increased metastatic potential (1Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of CD44 loss in these tumors is largely unknown; however, in prostate carcinomas, CD44 expression is repressed through the methylation of the 5′-CpG islands in the CD44 promoter (40Lou W. Krill D. Dhir R. Becich M.J. Dong J.T. Frierson Jr., H.F. Isaacs W.B. Isaacs J.T. Gao A.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2329-2331PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, loss of heterozygosity mapped to the 19p locus (which overlaps with BRG-1) also occurs as a late-stage event in prostate cancer (41Nupponen N.N. Hyytinen E.R. Kallioniemi A.H. Visakorpi T. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1998; 101: 53-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There are numerous ties between transcriptional regulation, chromatin structure, and methylation. Three SWI2/SNF2-like proteins, Mi-2, ATRX, and DDM1, have been implicated in DNA methylation (42Gibbons R.J. McDowell T.L. Raman S. O'Rourke D.M. Garrick D. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 43Jeddeloh J.A. Stokes T.L. Richards E.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Specifically, DDM1 maintains genomic methylation through its ability to either modify histones or increase the accessibility of DNA methyl-transferase. The chromatin-remodeling activity of Mi-2 and ATRX is thought to be targeted specifically to DNA to initiate or maintain methylation-mediated transcriptional control. However, it remains to be determined whether the recruitment of SWI/SNF components to chromatin stimulates methylation or if methylation is causative for the recruitment of specific chromatin-remodeling activities. Therefore, determining whether BRG-1 influences the methylation of the CD44 promoter would be important in defining its mechanism of gene regulation. The importance of SWI/SNF in cancer is becoming increasingly apparent. Recently, BRG-1 has been linked to breast cancer by the finding that the coactivator function of BRCA1 on p53 transcription is mediated through BRG-1 (30Bochar D.A. Wang L. Beniya H. Kinev A. Xue Y. Lane W.S. Wang W. Kashanchi F. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2000; 102: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that BRG-1 is required for RB signaling to specific cell cycle targets (22Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 32Strobeck M.W. Fribourg A.F. Puga A. Knudsen E.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1857-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alteration of another SWI/SNF subunit was identified after a genetic screen in malignant rhabdoid tumors, where the hSNF5/INI1gene located on the long arm of chromosome 22, is either mutated or deleted in rhabdoid tumors (44Versteege I. Sevenet N. Lange J. Rousseau-Merck M.F. Ambros P. Handgretinger R. Aurias A. Delattre O. Nature. 1998; 394: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 45DeCristofaro M.F. Betz B.L. Wang W. Weissman B.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that loss of other SWI/SNF subunits like Baf 47, Baf 57, and Baf 155 occur in a variety of tumors; however, it remains to be determined whether loss of these other subunits affect tumorigenesis or CD44 expression (46DeCristofaro M.F.

This study shows that BRG-1 is required for enabling CD44 expression and provides a mechanism through which CD44 is lost in cancer. These findings suggest that BRG-1 loss may contribute to the formation of the metastatic phenotype.

Due to the similarity of structure and promiscuity of receptor recognition, the specific role of each member of the family has not yet been identified.

Moreover, VEGFmRNA expression is up-regulated by epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, IL-6 in several cell types, and by IL-1β in smooth muscle cells (20Pertovaara L. Kaipainen A.

VEGF-C expression in cultured fibroblasts is induced by serum, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and several factors, including IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (23Enholm B. Paavonen K. Ristimäki A.

Vegf-D appeared to be differently regulated, because it was expressed in cells grown in low serum conditions (9Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Analyzing Vegf-D mRNA expression in mouse fibroblasts we observed that this growth factor, differently from the other members of the VEGF family, was induced by calcium-dependent cell-cell interactions. Cell-cell adhesion is mediated by cadherins, a large family of transmembrane calcium-dependent adhesive glycoproteins that form homotypic binding with their extracellular domain on adjacent cells (25Steinberg M.S. McNutt P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Marrs J.A. Nelson W.J. Int. Rev.

Although it is generally thought that cadherin expression results in a tight cell association, this is not a general principle and mesenchymal cells, which are loosely associated, express mesenchyme-specific cadherins like cadherin-11 (28Okazaki M.

Commun. 1995; 3: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The data presented in this report demonstrate that Vegf-Dmessenger is strongly induced by direct cell-cell contact. This induction can be inhibited by depletion of extracellular Ca2+ from the culture medium. Inhibition of cadherin-11 expression in contacting fibroblasts reduces Vegf-D mRNA induction, whereas cadherin-11 expression in fibroblasts, that do not express cadherin-11, restores Vegf-D induction. These results identify cadherin-11 as a surface molecule involved inVegf-D regulation by cell-cell interaction. The mouse cadherin-11full-length cDNA was amplified from a mouse fibroblast cDNA library (9Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), using the primers 5′-GAGAGGATCCACCACCATGAAGGAGAACTACTG-3′ and 5′-GAGACTCGAGTTAAGAGTCATCATCAAAAGTG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.) in the sense (giving MO447) and antisense (giving MO334) orientation under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The oligonucleotide sequences were obtained from the EBI Nucleotide Sequence Data Base under accession numbers D21253 (OB-cadherin) andD31963 (cadherin-11). All constructs were checked by automated sequencing. Mouse embryo fibroblasts were isolated from 14-day CD1 mouse embryos as described previously (32Orlandini M. Semplici F. Ferruzzi R. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21291-21297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, mouse embryo, mouse 3T3-type, NIH 3T3, and BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Stable clones expressing mouse cadherin-11 were obtained from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with thecadherin-11 expression vector MO447 by standard CaPO4 precipitation procedures (32Orlandini M. Semplici F. Ferruzzi R. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21291-21297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected using 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable clones expressing mouse cadherin-11 in the antisense orientation were obtained from BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the plasmid MO334, and transfectants were selected using 0.4 mg/ml G418. The same empty vector was used to generate mock stable clones. Mouse fibroblasts were plated 14–16 h before day 0 on 10-cm tissue culture dishes at different density, and starting from day 0, culture medium was changed every 2 days. Low, medium, and high cell densities corresponded to cells plated from about 20% to about 70% confluence. The degree of cell confluence was monitored under an inverted microscope. The cell cycle was arrested by adding cyclosporin A (0.95 μg/ml), colchicine (0.11 μg/ml), or tunicamycin (0.5 μg/ml) in the culture medium of subconfluent fibroblasts for 24 h. Conditioned medium was obtained from the culture medium of fibroblasts growing at high cell confluence, diluted 1:1 (v/v) with complete medium, and used to stimulate subconfluent fibroblasts for 33 h. The heparin wash of confluent fibroblasts was performed by using a solution of heparin (100 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. After taking off the medium, the heparin solution was left on confluent cells for 2 h at room temperature, collected, centrifuged, diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, and used to stimulate subconfluent fibroblasts for 33 h. As negative control the heparin solution not left on the cells was used. To chelate Ca2+ in the culture medium, confluent fibroblasts were grown for 24 h in the presence of 2.2 mm EGTA. Poly-HEME (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to inhibit cell adhesion to growth surface in culture dishes. Culture plates were coated with 6 mg/ml poly-HEME in 95% ethanol and allowed to air dry in a sterile environment. Fibroblast cells were seeded at high cell density in plates precoated with poly-HEME and after 48 h cells were collected by centrifugation and RNA was extracted. To block or stimulate Ca2+ flux through calcium channels, fibroblasts were grown either for 18 h at high cell density in the presence of Ca2+ channel antagonists (10 μm diltiazem, 50 μm amiloride, 20 μm nifedipine, 10 μm verapamil, 1 μm ω-conotoxin GVIA) or for 24 h at low cell density in the presence of a Ca2+channel agonist (1.25 μm BAY K-8644). Cyclosporin A, colchicine, tunicamycin, diltiazem, amiloride, and ω-conotoxin GVIA were purchased from BioMol Research Laboratories, and nifedipine, verapamil, BAY K-8644 were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell synchronization agents and calcium channel modulators were used at concentrations established from the literature to have maximal effects on their targets. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (33Chomzyski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was run on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred onto nylon membranes, and cross-linked by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Filters were hybridized with32P-labeled probes, washed as described (9Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and analyzed by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Rat glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) was used as a control for RNA loading. Digoxigenin-labeled Vegf-Dsense and antisense RNA probes were generated from a cDNA fragment corresponding to the complete coding sequence of the mouseVegf-D gene. Mouse fibroblasts were grown on microscopic slides at different degrees of confluence and fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (34Boom R. Geelen J.L. Sol C. Raap A.K. Minaar R.P. Klavier B.P. Noordaa J.v. d. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 851-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, to increase permeability cells were treated for 10 min with 0.2n HCl and for 25 min at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Then cells were washed in PBS and post-fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were hybridized overnight in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with the digoxigenin-labeled probes diluted at 1 μg/ml in hybridization buffer (60% deionized formamide, 2× SSC buffer, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5% dextran sulfate, 250 μg/ml yeast RNA, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The slides were washed, and the hybridized digoxigenin-conjugated probes were detected by using the fluorescent antibody enhancer set (Roche Diagnostics) according to standard procedures. Slides were counterstained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 ng/ml, mounted in PBS containing 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50% glycerol, and examined under a Leica TCS confocal laser-scanning microscope. The sense strand gave no signal. Whole cell extracts were prepared by rinsing cultures with cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA). Cells were harvested with a rubber policeman, centrifuged, and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EDTA) containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostic). Protein concentration of cell extracts were determined by using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Equal loading was confirmed by staining in Ponceau S solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 3% dry milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with goat polyclonal antibodies against OB-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 0.4 μg/ml for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature and washed in PBS, and finally the bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse fibroblasts were seeded onto glass coverslips, cultured overnight, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min and blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with goat polyclonal anti-OB-cadherin antibodies. After washing, the coverslips were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence of donkey anti-goat IgG labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). To localize actin filaments, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added along with secondary antibodies at 2 μg/ml. Coverslips were then mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) and examined under a Leica TCS confocal laser-scanning microscope. UnlikeVEGF-C, whose expression is induced by several growth factors (23Enholm B. Paavonen K. Ristimäki A. Kumar V. Gunji Y. Klefstrom J. Kivinen L. Laiho M. Olofsson B. Jukov V. Eriksson U. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2475-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 24Ristimaki A. Narko K. Enholm B. Joukov V. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8413-8418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), Vegf-D is not induced by cell treatment with platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 4, basic fibroblast growth factor, or transforming growth factor β (data not shown). Moreover, we previously observed that in low serum conditions fibroblasts expressed high levels of Vegf-D transcripts (9Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To test whether Vegf-D mRNA induction may require high cell density, RNA was collected at various time points from fibroblasts plated at different densities. At day 0, when cells were plated at low (20% confluence) or medium (40% confluence) density, the expression of Vegf-D was barely detectable, whereas someVegf-D expression could be detected in cells plated at the highest density (70% confluence) (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–3). Two days later, after the cells reached a higher confluence, we observed a correspondent induction of Vegf-D transcripts. In particular, Vegf-D expression was increased in the cells originally plated at medium and high density (lanes 5 and6). In fact, after 2 days, these cells reached about 90 and 98% confluence, respectively, with elevated cell-cell interactions. At day 2, cells that were originally plated at low density (lane 4) were at about 30% confluence and showed still lowVegf-D expression. Quantitative analysis revealed that cells plated at higher density reached the highest expression ofVegf-D between days 4 and 6 from plating, cells plated at medium density at day 6, and cells plated at low density at about day 8 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the levels of Vegf-D transcripts and cell density are directly correlated. Next we examined whether cell cycle arrest or soluble autocrine growth factor(s) accumulating in the culture medium, or on the surface of cells growing at high cell density, could be responsible for Vegf-D induction. The treatment of subconfluent cells with the cell cycle inhibitors cyclosporin A, colchicine, or tunicamycin did not lead to Vegf-D induction (Fig.2 A). Neither the treatment of subconfluent cells with conditioned medium nor with a heparin wash from confluent cells could induce Vegf-D expression, suggesting that autocrine-soluble factors were not involved in Vegf-Dinduction (Fig. 2 B, compare lane 1 withlanes 2 and 4). To test whether cell-cell interaction and/or cell-plate contacts would play a role inVegf-D induction, we analyzed Vegf-D mRNA levels in cells growing either in the presence of EGTA or in plates precoated with poly-HEME. In the presence of EGTA, cells grew at a normal rate, acquired a round shape, and lost interactions with each other and with the culture plate. Deprivation of Ca2+ from the culture medium strongly inhibited Vegf-D mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2 C, lane 1). On the contrary, culture plates precoated with poly-HEME, which inhibited cell adhesion to the plate, did not affect Vegf-D induction (Fig.2 C, lane 2), suggesting that cell-matrix interactions are not involved in Vegf-D expression. Because Ca2+ depletion from the culture medium might affect calcium influx into the cells, we tested the expression of Vegf-DmRNA in cells treated with different Ca2+ channel blockers. The treatment of confluent cells with the calcium channel antagonists nifedipine, verapamil, amiloride, diltiazem, or ω-conotoxin GVIA did not inhibit Vegf-D mRNA expression, and the treatment of sparse cells with the calcium channel agonist BAY K-8644 did not induce Vegf-D expression (Fig.2 D). Therefore, this excluded that calcium influx plays a role in the Vegf-D up-regulation. To directly observe Vegf-D mRNA expression in contacting cells we performed in situexperiments with cultured fibroblasts plated at various degrees of confluence. Hybridization with Vegf-D antisense probe showed that single cells expressed very poor levels of Vegf-DmRNA, whereas contacting fibroblasts did express high levels ofVegf-D messenger. This could be observed even at the level of two interacting cells (Fig. 3,A and B). Taken together, the above experiments demonstrated that both cell-cell interaction and extracellular calcium ions are required forVegf-D up-regulation in mouse fibroblasts. Homophilic calcium-dependent cell-cell interactions are mediated by cadherins (25Steinberg M.S. McNutt P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that direct interaction between contacting fibroblasts, mediated by cadherins, could be responsible for Vegf-D up-regulation. First we examined by Northern blot analysis the expression of cadherins in sparse and confluent fibroblasts with different cadherin probes. We observed that, in fibroblasts, grown at different degrees of confluence, cadherin-11, a mesenchymal-specific cadherin, was strongly induced by cell-cell contact (Fig.4). Importantly, cadherin-11mRNA induction was preceding Vegf-D mRNA of 8–12 h, suggesting that cadherin-11 could be involved in Vegf-Dregulation. Immunostaining of contacting fibroblasts using anti-cadherin-11 antibodies revealed a positive staining at the cell surfaces (Fig.5). In sparse cells cadherin-11 was localized at intercellular contacts, whereas it was mostly absent from surfaces free of cell contact (Fig. 5 A). At confluence cadherin-11 staining was observed at the level of the whole cell membrane (Fig. 5 B). To examine whether the localization of cadherin in fibroblasts depends on Ca2+, contacting cells were treated with EGTA. As expected, within the first hour cadherin-11 signal disappeared from the cell surface and became mostly cytoplasmic (Fig. 5 C). Addition of Ca2+ to the media restored cell-cell contacts, with reappearance of cadherin-11 at the intercellular contacts and induction of Vegf-D mRNA in the cells (not shown). In our study, mouse 3T3 type fibroblasts, derived from mice strain 129/SvJ × C57BL/6J (129-B6) (35Hu E. Mueller E. Oliviero S. Papaioannou V.E. Johnson R. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3094-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), were used for comparative analysis of gene expression, because Vegf-D was strongly expressed in these cells. We tested whether other fibroblasts showed the same Vegf-D mRNA regulation. Primary embryo fibroblasts obtained from CD1 mice and BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts revealed a Vegf-D mRNA strong induction that correlated withcadherin-11 high expression in confluent cells. Instead, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressed barely detectable levels of bothcadherin-11 and Vegf-D mRNAs (Fig.6). Thus, extending the correlation between Vegf-D mRNA induction and cadherin 11expression in the same cells. To directly evidence that cadherin-11 is required for Vegf-Dexpression, we generated, from BALB/c 3T3 cells, stable cell lines overexpressing cadherin-11 in the antisense orientation. Analysis of several stable clones revealed a variable level of cadherin-11 measured by Western blot of cell lysates. Two clones expressing low levels of cadherin-11 were analyzed forVegf-D expression (Fig.7 A). By Northern blot analysis of the cadherin-11 antisense clones using Vegf-Dprobe, we observed that inhibition of cadherin-11 resulted in a strong reduction of Vegf-D expression (Fig. 7, compare Aand B). The converse experiment was performed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, because these cells expressed low levels of cadherin-11. From NIH 3T3 we generated stable clones expressing, under the control of a constitutive promoter, cadherin-11 and analyzed Vegf-D mRNA expression levels in contacting cells. Two clones expressing higher levels of cadherin-11 were chosen for Vegf-D expression analysis (Fig. 7 C). In these cells the ectopic expression of cadherin-11 induced a significant increase of Vegf-Dtranscripts (Fig. 7, compare C and D). In multicellular organisms, intercellular interactions and inductive signals play a major role in cell fate during development. Cell-cell adhesion, dictated by homophilic surface molecules like cadherins, determine cell patterning establishing the tissue architecture; however, secreted growth factors, which act at a few cell diameters, modify the expression pattern of neighboring target cells. Here we demonstrate that in cultured fibroblasts direct cell-cell interaction, mediated by the mesenchyme-specific cadherin-11, triggersVegf-D mRNA induction, suggesting cross-talk occurs between cell adhesion and growth factor signaling. Several lines of evidence support the model that Vegf-Dexpression is regulated by direct cell-cell interactions via cadherin-11. First, Vegf-D is not induced in subconfluent cells under diverse culture conditions, whereas its expression is dramatically increased in cells that reach confluence. Second, the addition of conditioned media from cells highly expressingVegf-D does not induce its expression in cells grown at low density, excluding the possibility that autocrine-diffusible factors are instrumental in this activation. Third, depletion of extracellular calcium ions, but not inhibition of cells to signal through calcium flux, blocks Vegf-D expression, demonstrating that direct calcium-dependent cell-cell interactions are required. Fourth, Vegf-D expression directly correlates with cadherin-11 localization on the cell-interacting surfaces. Fifth, down-modulation or overexpression of cadherin-11 in fibroblasts affectsVegf-D expression in a negative and positive manner, respectively. Thus, the experiments described in this report provide evidence that cadherin-11 mediates a cell interaction signaling that leads to the regulation of Vegf-D in contacting fibroblasts. Cadherins play an important role in cell recognition and sorting during development (36, 37; and references therein). Their function has been perceived to link and stabilize connections between cells through interaction with the cytoskeleton. However, cytoplasmic domains of cadherins are highly diversified, and examples of cadherins have been found associated with signal transduction molecules and/or able to induce intracellular messengers, suggesting that cadherins mediate signal transduction pathways upon ligand binding (for review see Ref.38Yagi T. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1169-1180PubMed Google Scholar). During development Vegf-D mRNA expression appears to be restricted to cadherin-11-positive mesenchymal cells. In the developing mouse embryo cadherin-11 is expressed in migratory cells derived from neural crest cells and in cells involved in mesenchymal condensation (30Kimura Y. Matsunami H. Inoue T.

Although it is difficult to assign a specific role to each member of the family, it is likely that a coordinated regulation of each factor is required for the correct three-dimensional formation of new vessels. Therefore, the pattern of expression of each factor may contribute to explain its role in the angiogenic process. Interestingly, VEGF is strongly induced by hypoxia whereas VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D are not (17Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol.

Vegf-D regulation by cell-cell contact is consistent with a model in which aggregating fibroblasts switch on the expression of a factor that is chemotactic to endothelial cells and thus could recruit them to the forming tissue. The cell-cell contact mediated by cadherin-11 in vitro may mimic, in part, the angiogenic process and suggests that Vegf-D expression might be involved in the initial steps of the angiogenic process. The neovascularization and/or formation of lymphatic vessels in solid tumors is induced by tumor cells that express inductive angiogenic factors, which promote vessels sprouting with the recruitment of endothelial cells to the growing tumor mass (10Nicosia R.F.

However, tumor vasculature is highly disorganized with vessels being dilated, tortuous, and fenestrated and having excessive branching and uneven diameters (43Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). This could be the result of the imbalance of angiogenic factors. The fine regulation of VEGF-D by cadherin signaling is probably compromised in tumor cells especially considering that cadherin expression is altered during the malignant progression of tumors (44Dorudi S.

However, this mutation did not affect the function of Nfs1p in biogenesis of mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins. The growth defect of the mutant was complemented by simultaneous expression of the mature Nfs1p, which contains the intact nuclear localization signal but lacks its mitochondrial-targeting presequence.

In the diazotroph Azotobacter vinelandii, the nifS gene was first identified as a member of the nif operon that plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of nitrogenase (1Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6737-6744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical analyses ofA. vinelandii NifS reveal that it is a PLP1-containing enzyme exhibiting desulfurase activity that produces elemental sulfur andl-alanine from l-cysteine (2Zheng L.

These findings suggest that the physiological function of NifS is to supply inorganic sulfur for the assembly of the iron-sulfur cluster in nitrogenase (3Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the role of Nfs1p in the process of tRNA splicing, which is thought to take place in the nucleus, remains unclear. Mouse and human counterparts to Nfs1p (mNfs1 and hNfs1, respectively) have also been identified (7Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H.

The full-length hNfs1 protein also possesses a mitochondrial-targeting presequence and has been shown to be localized to mitochondria.

These results suggest that a fraction of Nfs1p may have some essential function other than iron-sulfur cluster assembly, possibly in a different subcellular location. In this study, we identified a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence in the mature domain of yeast Nfs1p and showed in vivo that this sequence was crucial for the physiological function of extramitochondrial Nfs1p. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TableI. A 2% galactose-containing medium (SC-Gal) was used to express a gene under the galactose-inducible (GAL1) promoter. A 2% glucose-containing medium (SC-D) and a 2% lactate-containing medium (SC-lactate) were used to depress theGAL1 promoter (19Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). It was cloned into the URA3-containing vector pYX013 (Ingenius) downstream of the GAL1 promoter. This plasmid was linearized by cutting at a unique BlnI site in the cloned NFS1 fragment and was integrated by homologous recombination into the corresponding region in the chromosomalNFS1 locus in W303–1B cells. Recombinants were selected on uracil-depleted medium, and correct integration was confirmed by PCR. One recombinant whose chromosomal NFS1 expression was controlled by the inducible GAL1 promoter was named YN101 and used as a host strain to express the additional plasmid-borne Nfs1p (either wild-type or mutant Nfs1p). To construct a plasmid that constitutively expresses the wild-type Nfs1p, the entire NFS1-coding region was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into a CEN4-basedTRP1-containing plasmid pTT-GAP (21Nakai M. Endo T. Hase T. Tanaka Y. Trumpower B.L. Ishiwatari H. Asada A. Bogaki M. Matsubara H. J Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) so the insertedNFS1 could be expressed under the constitutive glycelaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP1) promoter. This plasmid was named pTT-NFS1. To express Nfs1p with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine peptide tag, the pTT-NFS1-h6 plasmid was also constructed in a similar manner to pTT-NFS1, except for the use of a (CATCAC)3-containing 3′-end primer for the initial PCR amplification. The NLS-like sequence RRRPR found in the Nfs1p clone was changed to RRGSR by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was named pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6, which expressed the mutant Nfs1p containing the RRGSR sequence instead of the intact RRRPR sequence. According to the sequence alignment of NifS-like proteins, a methionine at residue 104 in yeast Nfs1p (Met104) was near the second methionine of hNfs1, and another methionine at residue 118 (Met118) was conserved among the three eukaryotic NifS-like proteins including hNfs1. Met104 and the Met118in yeast Nfs1p were replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutant NFS1-h6 genes were integrated into pTT-GAP to make pTT-M2A-NFS1-h6 and pTT-M3A-NFS1-h6, respectively. These plasmids were introduced into YN101 to make strains that expressed the wild-type Nfs1p under the inducible GAL1 promoter and that expressed the plasmid-borne Nfs1p or mutant Nfs1p with or without a (histidine)6-tag under the constitutive GAP1promoter. Plasmid pNS and pNS-NLS used for the nuclear transportation trap analyses (22Ueki N. Oda T. Kondo M. Yano K. Noguchi T. Muramatsu M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1338-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were donated by K. Nagahari (Helix, Inc. Japan). The mature Nfs1p (mNfs1p)-encoding region was inserted between theXhoI and EcoRI sites in pNS to construct the pNS-mNFS1 plasmid, which expresses an NES-LexAD-mNfs1p fusion protein. Plasmid pNS-GSR-mNFS1, which expresses a NES-LexAD-GSR-mNfs1p fusion protein, was constructed in a similar manner. We constructed another series of the mutant NFS1 derivatives by PCR, which were inserted into the ADE2-containing plasmid YIpDCE1, a kind gift from R. Stearman (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (19Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene. 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were as follows: YIpNFS1 for expression of the entire Nfs1p, YIpGSR-NFS1 for the entire Nfs1p with the RRGSR sequence instead of the intact NLS sequence (GSR-Nfs1p), YIpmNFS1 for mNfs1p, YIpGSR-mNFS1 for the mNfs1p with the RRGSR sequence (GSR-mNfs1p), and YIpAla421-mNFS1 for the mNfs1p with an Ala421 instead of the Cys421, which is critical for its desulfurase activity (Ala421-mNfs1p). TheNFS1 derivatives in these plasmids were all expressed under the constitutive yeast phosphoglycerol kinase promotor (19Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene. 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each plasmid was linearized by cutting at a unique StuI site in the ADE2 gene in the vector backbone and then integrated into the chromosomal ade2 locus of YN101, YN101(pTT-NFS1-h6), or YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6) by homologous recombination. ADE2 + colonies were selected on the adenine-depleted SC-Gal, and cells with proper integration were used for further analyses. One XhoI restriction site in the pYK16 plasmid (kindly provided by S. Nishikawa at Nagoya University) that was located downstream of the EGFP gene was removed, and the resulting plasmid was named pYK16EX. The following pYK16EX derivatives were used for the expression of various Nfs1p-EGFP fusion proteins under the yeastGAL1 promoter: pYK-NFS1 for the entire Nfs1p-EGFP, pYK-GSR-NFS1 for Nfs1p-EGFP with the altered RRGSR-sequence in Nfs1p, pYK-mNFS1 for mNfs1p-EGFP, and pYK16-GSR-mNFS1 for mNfs1p-EGFP with the altered RRGSR sequence. These plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae W303 (diploid strain), and transformants were selected on uracil-depleted medium. Yeast cells were grown in SC-Gal to A 600 to 0.5 and fixed with 5% formaldehyde in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon). For complete depletion of wild-type Nfs1p expressed under the GAL1 promoter, cells were grown with SC-lactate for 40 h at 30 °C before harvesting. Subcellular and submitochondrial fractionations were performed as described previously (21Nakai M. Endo T. Hase T. Tanaka Y. Trumpower B.L. Ishiwatari H. Asada A. Bogaki M. Matsubara H. J Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were finally resuspended in 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) and 0.6 m sorbitol. Proteins in each fraction were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed with an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Various Nfs1p-related expression products were detected with the purified anti-mouse Nfs1 antibody (7Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plasmid-borne Nfs1p-h6 and GSR-Nfs1p-h6 were also detected with anti-(hexahistidine peptide tag) monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). Mitochondrial fractions were assayed for the activities of two iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes (aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase) and one non-iron-sulfur protein (malate dehydrogenase). Aconitase was assayed by measuring the formation of cis-aconitate at 240 nm (23Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase activity coupling to cytochromec reduction was assayed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 550 nm (24Fansler B. Lowenstein J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 26-30Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Malate dehydrogenase activity coupling to β-NAD+ reduction was assayed by monitoring the increase in the product at 340 nm (25Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 34-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DNA manipulations were performed by standard protocols for E. coli (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and for S. cerevisiae (27Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 117-167Google Scholar). Protein estimation was performed with the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All of the known eukaryotic Nfs1 proteins have a mitochondrial-targeting presequence followed by a conserved sequence also found in bacterial NifS proteins (7Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Nfs1p amino acid sequence with the protein sorting signal searching program PSORT also identified an NLS-like sequence, RRRPR, in the mature Nfs1p sequence (Fig.1 A). Sequence alignment of three known eukaryotic (yeast, mouse, and human) Nfs1 proteins showed that this NLS-like sequence was completely conserved (Fig.1 B). In contrast, most bacterial NifS proteins, includingA. vinelandii NifS, had somewhat diverse sequences in the corresponding region, including one neutral residue (glycine or threonine) instead of the basic residue in the third or the fourth position of the sequence (Fig. 1 B). However, both theE. coli and A. vinelandii IscS proteins possess the RRKPR sequence, which is similar to the NLS-like sequence found in eukaryotic Nfs1 proteins (Fig. 1 B). Several attempts to detect endogenous Nfs1p in the nucleus by immunoblotting failed (7Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), possibly because Nfs1p is only present at extremely small levels in the nucleus. We tried to visualize the intranuclear localization of Nfs1p by overexpressing Nfs1p-EGFP fusion protein with or without the mitochondrial-targeting presequence (Fig. 2). The fusion protein was expressed in wild-type yeast diploid cells, and cellular localization of the proteins was observed by fluorescent microscopy. When the Nfs1p precursor protein, which contained the intact NLS-like sequence, was fused to the amino terminus of EGFP, the fusion protein was clearly localized to mitochondria, consistent with previous Western blotting analyses (7Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), whereas only faint fluorescence was observed in the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 2 c). In contrast, when the mNfs1p-EGFP was ectopically expressed, weak fluorescence could be detected in the cytosol and nucleus but not in mitochondria (Fig.2 e). We also examined localization of the GSR-mNfs1p-EGFP fusion protein, which contained an RRGSR sequence in place of the intact NLS-like sequence in Nfs1p. This RRGSR sequence was designed to mimic the corresponding region of bacterial NifS proteins (Fig.1 B). The resulting GSR-mNfs1p-EGFP also remained in the cytosol (Fig. 2 f). However, because of the very faint and scattered fluorescence, it was unclear whether the fused protein was excluded from the nucleus. Thus, we next took a more sensitive approach to exploring the possible localization of Nfs1p to the nucleus. Using the nuclear transportation trap method (22Ueki N. Oda T. Kondo M. Yano K. Noguchi T. Muramatsu M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1338-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we examined whether fusion of Nfs1p to another protein could mediate translocation of that protein into the nucleus. In this method, NES-LexAD, an engineered transcription factor containing a nuclear export signal, is used to test whether a protein of interest has the capacity to localize to the nucleus of yeast EGY48 cells (28Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), which harbor the LexAD-responsive LEU2 reporter gene. If the fused protein contains an NLS, transformants are expected to form Leu+ colonies. We constructed two mNfs1p fusion proteins, one with an intact RRRPR sequence (NES-LexAD-mNfs1p) and the other with a mutated RRGSR sequence (NES-LexAD-GSR-mNfs1p). When the expression vector encoding each of these fusion proteins was introduced into EGY48 cells, transformants were first selected for a His+ phenotype. Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed immunologically with anti-LexAD monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Then these transformants were further tested for the leucine prototroph (Fig. 3). If the Nfs1p contains a functional NLS, transformants were expected to form His+/Leu+ colonies. As shown in Fig.3 C, transformants that expressed the NES-LexAD-mNfs1p showed the Leu+ phenotype, whereas cells expressing the NES-LexAD-GSR-mNfs1p had the His+/Leu−phenotype (Fig. 3 D). These results suggested that the RRRPR sequence potentially functions as an NLS in Nfs1p and that nuclear localization is lost when the sequence is altered to RRGSR. TheNFS1 gene has been shown to be essential for cell viability (5Kolman C. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R.

Therefore, a yeast strain named YN101 in which the chromosomalNFS1 gene was expressed under the control of theGAL1 promoter was constructed and used as a host strain forin vivo complementation analyses. YN101 cells grow normally like the wild-type W303–1B strain in SC-Gal but cannot grow in SC-D. When the plasmid-borne Nfs1p precursor with a hexahistidine tag (Nfs1p-h6) was constitutively expressed in YN101 cells, the cell growth in SC-D was restored (section 1 in Fig.4). In contrast, expression of the hexahistidine-tagged mNfs1p (mNfs1p-h6) could not restore the cell growth in SC-D (Ref. 8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, data not shown). These results confirm that the mitochondrial localization of Nfs1p is essential for cell growth. We then examined whether the tagged mutant Nfs1p precursor (GSR-Nfs1p-h6) could affect the complementation ability when expressed in YN101 cells. As shown clearly in section 2 in Fig. 4, GSR-Nfs1p-h6 could not restore cell growth under the wild-type Nfs1p-depleted conditions. We also showed that two other Nfs1p mutants in which either the alternative AUG, corresponding to the second or the third AUG used in hNfs1 had been changed to GCG for alanine, could restore cell growth under the wild-type Nfs1p-depleted conditions (sections 3and 4 in Fig. 4). After 40 h of growth in SC-lactate, the GAL1promotor-driven expression of the wild-type Nfs1p in YN101 was depressed to a level at which no cross-reactive proteins could be detected by immunoblotting using anti-mouse-Nfs1 antibody (Fig.5). Under the same growth conditions, constitutively expressed plasmid-borne Nfs1p derivatives could be detected both with the anti-mouse Nfs1 antibody and with the anti-histidine-tag antibody. The GSR-Nfs1p-h6 fusion protein was found to be localized to mitochondria and present in amounts comparable with that of the control Nfs1p-h6 (Fig. 5). We then assayed the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins in the strain YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6) to test whether the GSR-Nfs1p functions in mitochondria equivalent to wild-type Nfs1p. The activities of two mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes, aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, were assayed in mitochondrial fractions that contained either Nfs1p-h6 or GSR-Nfs1p-h6 after growth of the cells in the absence of galactose for 40 h. As a control, the activity of a non-iron sulfur protein, malate dehydrogenase, was also assayed. As shown in Fig. 6, the GSR-Nfs1p-h6-containing mitochondria retained the activities of all three enzymes examined, with slightly lower levels than Nfs1p-h6-containing mitochondria. Mitochondria that contained no plasmid-borne Nfs1p exhibited low levels of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase activity but a similar level of the malate dehydrogenase activity to those containing the plasmid-borne Nfs1p-h6 (Fig. 6). These results indicate that mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins were assembled in the active holo form in YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6) in which chromosomal Nfs1p had been depleted but the plasmid-borne GSR-Nfs1p-h6 was expressed. In other words, the mitochondrially localized GSR-Nfs1p-h6 was found to retain the ability to mediate cluster assembly of mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins, indicating that the mutation in the NLS sequence did not cause any significant dysfunction in iron-sulfur biogenesis in mitochondria. If the nuclear localization of Nfs1p is essential for cell viability and if the severe growth defect of YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6) cells in SC-D is caused by the loss of nuclear localization of GSR-Nfs1p-h6, cell growth should be recovered when another mutant Nfs1p with an intact NLS sequence is simultaneously expressed outside the mitochondria. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed a series of NFS1derivatives (Fig. 7 A) and subcloned them into the shuttle vector YIpDCE1 (19Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene. 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Then we integrated each of these NFS1 derivatives into the ade2locus of the genomic DNA of YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6) and YN101(pTT-GAP). The Ade+ transformants, in which the proper integration had been confirmed by the PCR method (19Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene. 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), were spotted in a dilution series on either SC-Gal or SC-D (Fig. 7, B andC). When the mature Nfs1p (mNfs1p) was simultaneously expressed in YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6), cells could grow well in both SC-Gal and SC-D (Fig. 7 B, c). In the strain YN101(pTT-GAP), which contained no NFS1 gene, the growth of cells in the SC-D was not restored when the mNfs1p was expressed (Fig. 7 C,c). Interestingly, when the GSR-mNfs1p was simultaneously expressed in YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6), cell growth was not recovered under the wild-type Nfs1p-depleted conditions (Fig. 7 B,d). Since mNfs1p, which lacks the presequence, was expressed outside the mitochondria, these results indicate that the defective function of GSR-Nfs1p-h6 can be complemented by extramitochondrial mNfs1p, which contains an intact NLS sequence. This means that, in addition to mitochondrial Nfs1p, a fraction of Nfs1p is required outside the mitochondria, most likely in the nucleus, for cells to survive. NifS proteins possess a conserved cysteine residue that is the critical active site for desulfurase activity (2Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 3Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zheng L. White R.H.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The corresponding Cys421 in yeast Nfs1p was also shown to be essential for its iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis activity in mitochondria (9Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To examine whether this Cys421 is also required for the extramitochondrial function of Nfs1p, we constructed an additional plasmid encoding mutated mNfs1p whose Cys421 was changed to Ala421 (Ala421-mNfs1p). YN101(pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6) cells transformed with this plasmid could grow on SC-Gal but could not grow on SC-D (Fig. 7 B, e), indicating that the desulfurase activity was also important for the function of Nfs1p in the nucleus. Nfs1p has mostly been found in mitochondrial matrix in yeast cells (7Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is essential for cell growth (5Kolman C. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A mutant Nfs1p lacking the mitochondrial-targeting presequence could not restore the growth of the wild-type Nfs1p-depleted cells (Ref. 8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar and this study). Since cellular iron-sulfur proteins are involved in important metabolic processes such as electron transfer reactions and transcriptional regulation (29Cammack R. Cammack R. Advances in Inorganic Chemistry: Iron-Sulfur Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992: 281-322Google Scholar, 30Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 31Johnson M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 81-173Google Scholar, 32Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Nfs1p plays a significant role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly in mitochondria (33Kispal G. Steiner H. Court D.A. Rolinski B. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24458-24464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the functional loss of the mitochondrial Nfs1p should cause the loss of cell viability. In this study, we demonstrated that the localization of Nfs1p to the nucleus is also essential for cell viability. Although we failed to detect any endogenous or ectopically expressed Nfs1p in the nucleus directly by Western blotting or immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2), we were able to show that Nfs1p is present in the nucleus using more sensitive techniques (Figs. 4 to 7). Therefore, a small but significant fraction of Nfs1p is localized to the nucleus in vivo and plays an unknown essential role in cell viability. We also showed that the desulfurase activity of Nfs1p was required for the function of Nfs1p in the nucleus (Fig. 7) as well as in the mitochondria (9Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). There are several possible functions for nuclear localized Nfs1p. Nfs1p may be involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly in the nucleus, as it is in the mitochondrion. A [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing protein called Ntg2p, a yeast homologue of endonuclease III, has been shown to be present in the eukaryotic nucleus (34Augeri L. Lee Y.M. Barton A.B. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to imagine that other mitochondrial components involved in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (Isu1p, Isu2p, Nfu1p, Isa1p, Isa2p, Yah1p) (32Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) also have dual intracellular localization (in both mitochondrion and nucleus) like the Nfs1p protein. In addition, it has been proposed that the pre-assembled iron-sulfur cluster is transported from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol by a certain transporter(s) located in the mitochondrial membrane, which is necessary for the maturation of the cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins (8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 32Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the extra-mitochondrial Nfs1p is related to the iron-sulfur cluster in the nucleus rather than being involved in maturation, it may function in the repair or maintenance of pre-assembled iron-sulfur clusters of nuclear-localized iron-sulfur proteins such as Ntg2p. Another possibility is that the nuclear-localized Nfs1p is involved in nucleotide biosynthesis, because the allele of the NFS1 gene was first identified as a suppresser gene named SPL1, mutation of which affected tRNA splicing (5Kolman C. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). tRNA splicing occurs on the inner surface of the nuclear membrane (35Clark M.W. Abelson J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and is greatly influenced by specific modification of the ribonucleotides of tRNA. Recent reports on the distinct functions of the E. coli IscS protein (13Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Kambampati R.

A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) may shed some light on the function of nuclear-localized Nfs1p. E. coli IscS was first shown to possess a cysteine desulfurase activity that is involved in iron-sulfur protein biosynthesis (11Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and, subsequently, a sulfur transferase activity by which a sulfur atom is transferred to a uridine to produce a 4-thiouridine in tRNA (13Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Following this analogy, it is quite possible that nuclear Nfs1p is involved in nucleotide modification as a sulfur donor. Therefore, a mutation in Nfs1p may affect its function in the modification of specific ribonucleotides in the nucleus and on tRNA splicing. Recently, IscS proteins found in E. coli andSalmonella species have been reported to be involved in thiamine and nicotinic acid biosyntheses (15Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 36Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Bacillus subtilis nifS gene product has also been reported to function in NAD+ biosynthesis (37Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the tRNA splicing process includes an NAD+-dependent step in S. cerevisiae (38McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11986-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Consaul S.A. Stanford D.R. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13203-13210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the nuclear Nfs1p is likely to be involved in the process via its effect on NAD+ biosynthesis. Therefore, nuclear localization of Nfs1p would be essential for cell survival, because correct tRNA splicing is essential for yeast cell growth. How is the localization of yeast Nfs1p to either the mitochondria or the nucleus controlled? It has been reported that human NifS homologues (hNfs1) of different lengths were synthesized from a single transcript by differential translational initiation from alternative AUG codons and that the smaller (presequence-truncated) forms were found in the cytosol and nucleus, whereas the largest form was in mitochondria in a proteolytically processed mature form (10Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Yeast Nfs1p also possesses alternative methionine residues at the positions corresponding to the potential alternative translational initiation AUG codons of hNfs1 (Fig. 1 A). However, our experimental data (section3 and 4 in Fig. 4) suggest that the amino-terminal alternative translation does not contribute to localization of yeast Nfs1p to the nucleus. Internal initiation of mRNA translation coupled to a physiological function is rarely observed in eukaryotes (40Oh S.K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 41Bernstein J. Sella O. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, no internal ribosome entry sites have been shown to function in growing yeast (43Paz I. Abramovitz L. Choder M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21741-21745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dual intracellular localization of the yeast NifS homologue may be caused by a mechanism distinct from that of the human counterpart, hNfs1. It has not yet been elucidated whether the hNfs1 in the nucleus is essential for cell growth, but we assume that nuclear hNfs1 has some significant function. Recently, an increasing number of reports demonstrate localization of one protein to different cellular locations in vivo(44Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16501-16507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that, in some cases, re-localization of a protein to another organelle occurs after the initial localization to one organelle. For example, a single translation product of the yeast fumarase gene, which is distributed between the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix, is targeted to and processed in mitochondria before distribution (45Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that the newly synthesized fumarase precursor can either be fully translocated cotranslationally into the mitochondrial matrix or it can be folded into an import-incompetent state and released by retrograde movement through the translocation pore into the cytosol. Dual distribution of Nfs1p may follow a similar mechanism in which binding of the PLP to the mature domain of the precursor might promote folding outside of the mitochondria and prevent further translocation into the mitochondrial matrix. Such Nfs1p molecules can be released into the cytosol and then be re-localized to the nucleus with the aid of its NLS. Alternatively, the dual localization of the Nfs1p might be caused by a simple balance between the NLS and mitochondrial presequence functions after translation in the cytosol. Studies on the physiological function of the nuclear-localized Nfs1p in yeast cells are now under way in our laboratory. Determination of proteins that interact with Nfs1p in the nucleus may help to elucidate the function of Nfs1p in this location.

Our results indicate that V-ATPase a subunit genes are highly regulated and have tissue-specific function. Vacuolar-type H+-ATPases (V-ATPases1) are ATP-dependent proton pumps involved in the acidification of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells and are important for many facets of cellular and organismal function (for review, see Refs.1Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 149-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 3Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As well as contributing to fundamental cellular processes in the majority of eukaryotic cells, they also play specialized functions in certain cell types. In macrophages, the progressive acidification of phagosomes is an integral part of their maturation into lysosomes, whereas the acidification of early endocytic compartments is necessary for the recycling to the plasma membrane of transport molecules such as the transferrin receptor. In neurons, neurotransmitter trafficking is dependent on V-ATPases. The H+-driven antiporters responsible for synaptic vesicle import of a specific neurotransmitter, such as the vesicular acetycholine transporter, are known to be driven by proton gradients established by a V-ATPase localized to the same vesicle (4Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Gasnier B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The V-ATPases are composed of two complexes, V1 and V0, that serve different functions (for review, see Refs.6Nelson N. Perzov N. Cohen A. Hagai K. Padler V. Nelson H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V1, a complex of 570 kDa composed of eight subunits (A–H), is located on the cytoplasmic side of the vesicle membrane and is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. V0 is a 260-kDa complex with five different subunits (a,d, c, c′, and c“) of 17–100 kDa. It is an integral membrane complex and is responsible for proton translocation from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the vesicle. In essence, the V-ATPases resemble, both in terms of sequence and structure, the ATP synthases of mitochondria. ATP synthases, however, couple the synthesis of ATP to the flow of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm, and the overall topology of its two components is inverted, with the F1 complex (analogous to the V1 complex) being on the lumenal side. Interestingly, there is no clear homologue for the V0100-kDa a subunit within the analogous F0complex, suggesting that it plays a specific role in the function of the V-ATPases. In yeast, there are two a subunit genes that encode proteins that have distinct subcellular localization (8Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One, VPH1p, is associated with the central vacuole, whereas STV1p is thought to be a Golgi/endosome-specific form. Thus the two asubunits may be involved in targeting yeast V-ATPases to different intracellular membranes. Three murine a subunit genes have been characterized (a1, a2, and a3; Ref. 9Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For a1 and a3, there are two and three alternative transcripts, respectively, giving the possibility of substantial variation in the structure of the murine V-ATPase. Intriguingly, the level of expression of the different transcripts of the murine genes varies among different tissues (9Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This suggests that the V-ATPase complexes may have specialized compositions and structures, not only at the intracellular level but also in different tissues. The recent characterization of knockout mice for thea3 gene (ATP6i), which exhibit severe osteopetrosis due to loss of osteoclast-mediated extracellular acidification but no general defect in V-ATPase function, supports such a hypothesis (10Li Y.P. Chen W. Liang Y. Li E. Stashenko P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). More recently, mutations in the human orthologue have been shown to be responsible for a subset of human osteopetrosis (11Frattini A. Orchard P.J. Sobacchi C. Giliani S. Abinun M. Mattsson J.P. Keeling D.J. Andersson A.K. Wallbrandt P. Zecca L. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Villa A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 12Kornak U. Schulz A. Friedrich W.

Here, we describe the genetic and molecular identification of theCaenorhabditis elegans unc-32 gene, which encodes a set of V-ATPase 100-kDa a subunits. We show that the gene is one of a family of four V-ATPase a subunits encoding genes expressed in C. elegans. Furthermore, we show that a number of alternative unc-32 transcripts are produced by differential splicing of alternative exons and have characterized five mutants, two of which affect specifically one isoform. On the basis of our phenotypic and molecular analysis of the mutants, we postulate that specific isoforms may be involved in nervous system function, whereas others are required for viability. All strains including the wild-type N2 Bristol and strains containing the unc-32 alleles and the transformants were grown and maintained at 20 °C as described (13Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four new ethyl methanesulfonate-induced alleles,unc-32(f120), unc-32(f121), unc-32(f123), andunc-32(f131), were isolated in two noncomplementation screens for new unc-32 alleles. The three former were induced on a dpy-17(e164) ncl-1(e1865) chromosome, the latter on an unc-36(e251) chromosome. Several thousand mutagenized genomes were tested against unc-32(e189) and scored for an uncoordinated phenotype. The new alleles were back-crossed at least four times to wild type, and genetic analysis was conducted using standard procedures. The two alleles, f121and f123, were homozygous lethal and were kept heterozygous with the balancer qC1, dpy-19 glp-1, provided by J. Kimble. The integrated transformant eIs16[ZK637, unc-32+] was kindly provided by J. Sulston. The nonsense suppressor sup-7(st5) (14Wills N. Gesteland R.F. Karn J. Barnett L. Bolten S. Waterston R.H.

A. 1997; 94: 9782-9785Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was combined with all alleles but f131. All the plasmids used in this work were derived from the A1E5 plasmid (a gift from M. Craxton). A1E5 is a partial SauIIIA restriction fragment of the ZK637 cosmid (GenBank accession number Z11115), from 19434 to 32570, cloned in BlueScribe. E5-NS was obtained after NheI andSpeI restriction and religation. E5-BK was constructed by a partial BamHI restriction to keep the BamHI site of the large exon of ZK637.8. E5ΔPac corresponds to a deletion between the two PacI restriction sites of A1E5. E5-lin-9 was derived from E5-BK by SmaI and SacII restriction, T4 DNA polymerase treatment, and religation. E5-BK*, introducing a frameshift in exon 6, was derived from E5-BK by BamHI restriction, Klenow treatment, and religation. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion in exon 4b, unc-32e4::GFP, was constructed by introduction of a 3600-bpSmaI-PstI restriction fragment from E5-NS in theHinDIII (blunted)-PstI-digested plasmid pPD95.81 (a gift from A. Fire). Plasmids for injection were prepared by a standard alkaline lysis procedure, followed by LiCl precipitation. Injections were performed as described (17Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). Subclones of ZK637 were injected at a concentration of 10 ng/μl with plasmid pRF4 (encodingrol6(su1006), which confers a dominant rolling phenotype) at a concentration of 100 ng/μl. Some of the transformants also received either plasmid pPD93.97 (encoding a GFP reporter gene driven by themyo-3 promoter) or pPD20.97 (encoding a LacZ reporter gene driven by the myo-2 promoter) at a concentration of 20 ng/μl to check the presence of coinjected DNA directly by screening GFP in body wall muscle or β-galactosidase in the pharynx by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside staining (both pPD plasmids were gifts from A. Fire). Clones were injected intoe189 or f131 homozygotes and inunc-32(e189 or f123 or f121) dpy-17(e164)/qC1. Partial sequences from 15 cDNAs were aligned on the genome, and three clones were fully sequenced (yk15a11, yk244c11, and yk5d7). There was evidence for alternative splicing, and the alternative transcripts from the three clones were designated as unc-32 A, B, and C, respectively. The differential splicing patterns were also analyzed by restriction digestion and/or sequencing of specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products. Total RNA from mixed populations of wild-type worms was prepared as previously described (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar), reverse transcribed, and subjected to PCR with various sets of primers as well as the transpliced leaders SL1 and SL2 (19Krause M. Hirsh D. Cell. 1987; 49: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,20Huang X.Y. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8640-8644Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Amplification conditions and primers are available on request. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by restriction using enzymes cutting the transcripts only once, in exon 3 (XhoI), exon 4a (EcoRI), exon 4b (PstI), exon 7a (PvuI), and exon 7b (DrdI). Some RT-PCR products were sequenced on an ABI machine using dye deoxyterminators (Prism; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The traces were analyzed using theacembly program, developed by J. Thierry-Mieg and M. Potdevin. When referring to the ZK637 cosmid, exon positions are: exon 1, 21653–21816 (coding sequence starting at 21664); exon 2, 21898–22074; exon 3, 22182–22310; alternative exon 4a, 22560–22714; alternative exon 4b, 23003–23109; alternative exon 4c, 23347–23468; exon 5, 23629–23838; exon 6, 23893–25147; alternative exon 7a, 25269–25391; alternative exon 7b, 26117–26257; exon 8, 26370–26589; exon 9, 26754–26925; and exon 10, 27145–27250. Transcripts were transpliced with SL1 at position 21653. Alternative polyadenylation occurs at similar frequencies at positions 27671 (atypical poly(A) signal agtaaa 16–11 bp before the poly(A)) or 27784 (atypical poly(A) signal aacaaa 17–12 bp before the poly(A)). Note that the existence, extent, and alternative status of exons 4a, 4b, 4c, 7a, and 7b were wrongly predicted for ZK637.8 in the data bases. In situ hybridization analyses were performed as previously described (21Tabara H. Motohashi T. Kohara Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2119-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transgenic worms carrying the unc-32e4::GFP construct were observed with a confocal microscope; the image in Fig. 6 G is the projection of several Z serial sections. The genomic DNA of four mutant alleles (all but f123) was amplified with Takara Taq. PCR products covering the segments from −629 to 832, 394 to 1761, 1687 and 2162 to 3804, 2768 to 4622, and 4605 to 5851 (where position 1 is the A of the initiator ATG) were fully sequenced on both strands. RNA was extracted from the three alleles mutated in a splice junction,e189, f120, and f131, and subjected to RT-PCR analysis (see above) and sequencing. The nematode VHA-5 and VHA-6 proteins correspond respectively to the predicted F35H10.4 (GenBank accession number AAA81682) and VW02B12.1 (GenBank accession number CAA90758) proteins, encoded by the expressed YK6569 and YK634 genes. The nematode VHA-7 protein, corresponding to the predicted C26H9A.1 protein (GenBank accession number T19492), encoded by the YK778 expressed gene, was edited by removing the first 291 amino acids and the next to last exon, which does not occur in 5 of 5 independent cDNA clones. The 5′ region removed does not correspond to any available cDNA, nor does it resemble sequence in any of the well characterized 100 kDaa subunit proteins. Comparisons between the available human genomic sequence (GenBank accession number AC002537) and the published cDNA sequence for the human a1 gene (GenBank accession number NM_005177) allowed the deduction of the intron-exon boundaries. The intron-exon boundaries for the human a3 gene (OC116) were published previously (22Heinemann T. Bulwin G.C. Randall J. Schnieders B. Sandhoff K. Volk H.D. Milford E. Gullans S.R. Utku N. Genomics. 1999; 57: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences were aligned with the Multiple Alignment Program (developed by X. Huang). Phylogenetic trees were produced using the full-length protein sequences by neighbor joining using Clustalw alignment in Phylip format and the Treeview program. Theunc-32(e189) allele was isolated by Brenner (13Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as part of the first genetic screen for C. elegans mutants. Homozygous mutants are healthy and of normal size but exhibit a ventral coiler phenotype during backward movement (Fig.1). This defect is seen from the L2 stage onward. The only additional defect observed in e189 is the brood size, smaller by one-third when compared with wild type, probably because of a reduction in number of fertile sperm. We carried out a genetic noncomplementation screen and isolated two more recessive viable unc-32 alleles, f120 and f131.Although f120 shows a similar phenotype to e189and was subsequently found to correspond to an identical molecular lesion (see below), f131 presents a much stronger uncoordinated (Unc) phenotype. The L1 larvae were paralyzed and kinky as soon as they hatched; adults moved slightly better but were extreme forward and backward coilers (Table I). In addition, f131 animals were small, thin, transparent, and slow-growing and had a brood size half that of the wild type. From the interactions with the nDF17 deletion, fully uncovering the region, that lead to a stronger phenotype, i.e. a high frequency of lethals (Table I), and the molecular evidence presented below, we believe that these three uncoordinated alleles, e189, f120, and f131, are partial loss-of-function alleles.Table IComplementation, dosage effects and molecular defects in unc-32 allelesunc-32 allelese189 or f120f131f121f123e189 orf120Unc L2 to adultf131Strong UncExtreme Unc, all stagesf121Almost WTStrong Unc, especially in larvaeL2, L3, or L4 Letf12310% extreme Unc, 90% L1 LetL1 LetL1 LetEmb LetnDf1710% extreme Unc, 90% LetL1 LetL1 LetEmb Letunc-32+ Transformants1-aTransgenic worms with constructs containing the wild-type unc-32 locus.

All the alleles were combined with the deficiency of the entire locus nDf17, indicating that the null phenotype is embryonic lethal, the same as seen in f123 homozygotes. The two further alleles, f121 and f123, isolated in the screen are zygotic lethal. f123 is equivalent to the deficiency in all interallelic combinations and therefore behaves as a null (Table I). Additionally, it is suppressible by the amber nonsense suppressor sup-7 (14Wills N. Gesteland R.F. Karn J. Barnett L. Bolten S. Waterston R.H. Cell. 1983; 33: 575-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of a premature stop codon. f123 homozygotes arrest as late embryos, often with vacuolization of the intestinal region. This null allele is associated with a strict maternal effect lethality, giving rise to severe cell adhesion defects in the early embryos. In addition, we cannot exclude a sterility owing to lack of production of mature gametes. The weaker lethal allele f121 arrests at the larval L2, L3, or L4 stage, and before their premature death the movement of the larvae appears close to that of wild type. In contrast tof123, f121 almost fully complements the mild Unc alleles e189 and f120 and is fully viable when combined with e189, f120, and f131. f121/f131larvae move better than f131 homozygotes but are still highly impaired in their locomotion. Adults, however, are only backward ventral coilers, just like e189. Hence, the lethality off121, unlike that of f123, is rescued by each of the three Unc alleles, and conversely the Unc phenotype of these three alleles is partly rescued by f121. Such interallelic complementation defines unc-32 as a complex locus, a property often associated with alternative splicing. Genetic mapping had previously placed unc-32 betweensma-2 and lin-12 in the center of LG III (13Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation rescue of unc-32(e189) by microinjection of cosmids from the candidate region of the physical map showed that the gene is contained within both ZK637 and T05B2 2J. Sulston, personal communication. (Fig.2 A). We further refined the position of the gene by transformation rescue to a region of 9 kilobases (E5-BK, E5-NS, and E5-lin-9 constructs; see Fig.2 B), corresponding to the predicted gene ZK637.8. This gene encodes a protein similar in sequence to V-ATPase 100 kDa asubunits. Constructions in which part of ZK637.8 was deleted or in which a premature stop codon was introduced into the coding sequence of the gene failed to rescue the uncoordinated phenotype (E5-ΔPac and E5-BK* constructs; see Fig. 2 B). Although a rescue of the zygotic lethality of f123 and f121 was obtained, the transformants were sterile (Table I and Fig. 2), possibly because of an absence of germ line expression of the transgenes as previously reported (23Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Occasionally, the transforming plasmids rescued the various phenotypes, Unc, lethal, maternal effect lethal, and defect in gametogenesis, in a complex pattern. A particular transgenic array could rescue the Unc but not the lethal phenotype, whereas another, containing the same constructs, would do the opposite. This again presumably reflects the complexity of the unc-32 locus (see below). Sequencing of the ZK637.8 genomic region from four mutant alleles revealed different molecular alterations: e189 andf120 contain a point mutation in the splice acceptor site of exon 4b, f131 in the splice donor site of exon 6 (see below), and f121 is a G to A transition in exon 6 (Table I). Together, these results confirm the identity of unc-32 as ZK637.8. The gene is the first in an operon containing two others, ZK637.9 and ZK637.10. The former encodes a protein similar in sequence to thiamine pyrophosphokinase (24Nosaka K. Onozuka M. Nishino H. Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Ueyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34129-34133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The latter encodes a putative mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase. By RT-PCR, we showed that these three genes are expressed, and that although the transcript of ZK637.8 is trans-spliced to SL1, both ZK637.9 and ZK637.10 can be trans-spliced to SL2 (data not shown; Ref. 25Zorio D.A. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), as is normally the case for genes inC. elegans operons (26Spieth J. Brooke G. Kuersten S. Lea K. Blumenthal T. Cell. 1993; 73: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although in many operons the genes are functionally related, no evident link is apparent so far between the three genes of the unc-32 operon. Sequencing of existing cDNAs and specific RT-PCR products revealed a number of alternative splice patterns for the unc-32 transcripts (Fig.3, A and B). Allunc-32 transcripts analyzed contain 10 exons. There are at least six different transcripts, using three variants for exon 4 (a–c) and two for exon 7 (a and b). Although the alternative exons 4a–c do not encode peptides that closely resemble sequences found in other V-ATPases, they occur at a position in the sequence where an alternative splicing pattern has also been observed for the murinea1 gene (9Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may have an important functional role. Significantly, the mutation in unc-32(e189) is a G to A transition in the consensus splice acceptor site of exon 4b, meaning that in this allele, only the alternative transcripts with exon 4b should be affected. Consistent with this, anomalous unc-32 transcripts were found by RT-PCR amplification of the fourth exon region of total RNA extracted fromunc-32(e189) homozygotes (Fig. 3 C). Cloning and sequencing of the forms that contain exon4b in e189homozygotes revealed the addition of 22 bp upstream of the exon 4b because of the use of a new acceptor splicing site. The resulting anomalous transcript contains a premature stop codon and would encode a nonfunctional protein. The other alternative forms containing exons 4a and 4c are still produced (Fig. 3 C). The alternative seventh exons, 7a and 7b, are similar in sequence and presumably arose from a recent duplication, because a single exon of similar sequence is present in other species (Fig. 3A). Thef131 allele contains a G to A transition at the consensus splice donor site of the sixth exon, which affects the splicing of these alternative seventh exons (Fig. 3 C). The large anomalous unc-32 transcript found by RT-PCR amplification of the seventh exon region of total RNA extracted fromunc-32(f131) homozygotes was sequenced. This revealed the presence of intron 6 between exon 6 and exon 7a. Because a stop codon is present in the sixth intron, the resulting mutant protein would be truncated in the eighth transmembrane domain. The other band with a size similar to that of wild type (Fig. 3 C) corresponds to a mixture of alternate transcripts using cryptic donor sites. Because this allele is a hypomorph, not a null, we expect that some of these transcripts can be translated into a near full-length product that would differ from the wild type only in the relatively poorly conserved region around the exon 6-exon 7 junction. UNC-32 belongs to a family of highly conserved V-ATPasea subunit proteins. In other species there are multiple genes encoding V-ATPases a subunits. There are three genes in mice (9Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and other vertebrates, and searches in the availableDrosophila genomic sequence indicate that there are at least four members in the fly. 3GenBank™ accession numbers AAD34751, AAD34771, AAF53116, and AAF55550. In C. elegans, in addition to UNC-32, there are three other members of the family, named VHA-5, VHA-6, and VHA-7. Each of the four genes has a distinctive intron-exon structure. We could not detect alternative splicing of these genes, as judged by the analysis of several cDNAs. 4D. Thierry-Mieg and Y. Kohara, unpublished results. The existence of shared intron-exon boundaries among the four nematode genes and the two human genes for which data are available supports their common ancestry (Fig.4 A). Each of these putative proteins contain nine potential membrane-spanning regions (Ref. 27Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 B). The sequence identity (and similarity) between UNC-32A and other nematode and murine a subunit proteins are as follows: VHA-5, 50% (67%); VHA-6, 50% (65%); VHA-7, 46% (62%); a1, 55% (69%); a2, 43% (60%); and a3, 37% (55%). Phylogenetic analysis of the different members of this family indicates, in agreement with previous suggestions based on a more limited analysis (9Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), that the multiple genes appeared independently in vertebrates and invertebrates subsequent to their divergence from a common ancestor (Fig.5). Interestingly, although the UNC-32 protein is closer in sequence to the vertebrate a1 protein than to the other nematode proteins, the vha-7 gene shares more intron-exon boundaries with the human a1 anda3 genes than other nematode genes.Figure 5Evolutionary relationship between the V-ATPase 100-kDa a subunit proteins in different eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W1964086646,"Ligand binding to the PTH1 receptor is described by a “two-site” model, in which the C-terminal portion of the ligand interacts with the N-terminal domain of the receptor (N interaction), and the N-terminal region of the ligand binds the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor (J interaction). Previous studies have not considered the dynamic nature of receptor conformation in ligand binding and receptor activation. In this study the ligand binding mechanism was compared for the G-protein-coupled (RG) and uncoupled (R) PTH1 receptor conformations. The two-site model was confirmed by demonstration of spatially distinct binding sites for PTH(3–34) and PTH(1–14): PTH(1–14), which binds predominantly to the J domain, only partially inhibited binding of125I-PTH(3–34); and PTH(3–34), shown to bind predominantly to the N domain, only partially inhibited PTH(1–14)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. To assess the effect of R-G coupling, ligand binding to R was measured by displacement of125I-PTH(3–34) with 30 μm guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) present, and binding to RG was measured by displacement of 125I-[MAP]PTHrP(1–36) (where MAP is model amphipathic peptide), a new radioligand that binds selectively to RG. Agonists bound with higher affinity to RG than R, whereas antagonists bound similarly to these states. The J interaction was responsible for enhanced agonist binding to RG: residues 1 and 2 were required for increased PTH(1–34) affinity for RG; residue 5 of MAP-PTHrP(1–36) was a determinant of R/RG binding selectivity, and PTH(1–14) bound selectively to RG. The N interaction was insensitive to R-G coupling; PTH(3–34) binding was GTPγS-insensitive. Finally, several observations suggest the receptor conformation is more “closed” at RG than R. At the R state, an open conformation is suggested by the simultaneous binding of PTH(1–14) and PTH(3–34). At RG PTH(1–14) better occluded binding of 125I-PTH(3–34) and agonist ligands bound pseudo-irreversibly, suggesting a more closed conformation of this receptor state. The results extend the two-site model to take into account R and RG conformations and suggest a model for differences of receptor conformation between these states.

At RG PTH(1–14) better occluded binding of 125I-PTH(3–34) and agonist ligands bound pseudo-irreversibly, suggesting a more closed conformation of this receptor state. The results extend the two-site model to take into account R and RG conformations and suggest a model for differences of receptor conformation between these states. parathyroid hormone PTH-related protein bovine human rat model amphipathic peptide tuberoinfundibular peptide (7–39) G-protein G-protein-coupled receptor G-protein-uncoupled receptor state G-protein-coupled receptor state guanosine 5′-2-O-(thio)diphosphate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate The parathyroid hormone 1 (PTH1)1 receptor is a cell-surface signal transducer for PTH and PTH-related protein (PTHrP). PTH plays a central role in calcium homeostasis; the hormone acts on target cells in bone (osteoblasts) and kidney (renal tubule cells) to increase blood calcium levels (1Potts Jr., J.T.

PTHrP is an autocrine factor, believed to be involved in the maintenance of numerous tissues, and an important developmental regulator, controlling breast, pancreas, skin, and bone development (2Martin T.J.

The receptor belongs to the type II family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which respond to peptide ligands of intermediate size such as secretin, glucagon, calcitonin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The receptor can be divided into two functional domains; the large extracellular N-terminal domain (N domain) has been proposed to provide most of the binding energy for receptor-ligand interaction (12Bergwitz C.

Conformational change is central to the ability of a GPCR to transduce the extracellular signal of ligand binding across the plasma membrane to the intracellular signal of G-protein activation (37Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 38Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). As a result, evaluating the effect of this receptor conformational change is essential for understanding ligand binding and signal transduction mechanisms (37Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 38Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). These mechanisms have been examined extensively for GPCRs of the type I family, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor, leading to the development of the ternary complex model and its extended variants (37Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 38Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These models describe the reciprocal effects of G-protein (G) and agonist on their binding to the receptor (R). For type II GPCRs a great deal is known regarding the orientation of ligand binding, but very little is known regarding how the two-site binding mechanism is affected by the conformational changes in the receptor that result from R-G interaction. In this study we evaluated the effect of R-G interaction on the two-site binding mechanism for the PTH1 receptor.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies employing modified receptors and ligands have indicated a two-site mode of ligand recognition by the PTH1 receptor. The C-terminal portion of the 1–34 fragment of PTH or PTHrP interacts with the extracellular N-terminal receptor region (N interaction), and the N-terminal portion of the ligand binds to the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor (J interaction) (11Mannstadt M. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F665-F675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Goldring S.R. Jüppner H. J.

In this study we examined the effect of different receptor conformational states arising from receptor-G-protein interaction on the molecular mechanism of ligand binding to the PTH1 receptor. The principle findings of this study are as follows. 1) Receptor-ligand interaction for the unmodified receptor is well described by the two-site model. Strong, direct evidence for this binding mode was provided by the novel observation of allosteric interactions between the binding of PTH(1–14) and PTH(3–34) to the receptor together with the inference of simultaneous receptor binding of these two ligands. 2) Agonist ligands bind with higher affinity to the RG state than to the uncoupled receptor, whereas antagonist ligands bind with similar affinity to these states. 3) The J interaction is stabilized by R-G coupling, whereas the N interaction is not appreciably affected by R-G interaction. 4) A more closed receptor conformation is suggested for the PTH1 receptor when coupled to G-protein. These findings are summarized in the model in Fig.9.Figure 9Model for modulation of ligand binding to the PTH1 receptor by G-protein. A, the C-terminal portion of the ligand interacts with the N domain of the receptor. Subsequently, the N-terminal portion of the ligand binds to the J domain of the receptor (B). C, R-G interaction increases the affinity of the J interaction, possibly by producing a closure of the receptor conformation. Reciprocally, interaction of the ligand with the J domain increases the affinity of receptor for G-protein, stimulating G-protein activation. Binding of G-protein to the other states of the receptor (R and RLN) has been omitted for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observation of allosteric interactions between the binding of PTH(1–14) and PTH(3–34) confirms the two-site model for the unmodified PTH1 receptor. The inference of simultaneous binding of PTH(1–14) and PTH(3–34) is consistent with spatial and functional independence of receptor-binding sites that interact with the 1–14 and 15–34 regions of the ligand, as proposed previously (12Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Goldring S.R. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The allosteric analysis also provided insight into the mechanism of PTH(3–34) binding. PTH(1–14), used to block interactions of PTH(3–34) with the juxtamembrane domain (21Shimizu M. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21836-21843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), had very little effect on the receptor binding affinity of 125I-PTH(3–34) (1.25-fold increase of K i at the G-protein-uncoupled receptor). This finding indicates that PTH(3–34) does not interact appreciably with the juxtamembrane domain, implying that almost all the binding energy for PTH(3–34) is provided by the N interaction.The effect of R-G-coupling on ligand binding to the receptor was evaluated by comparing ligand affinity for the uncoupled receptor with the affinity for the RG complex. The former was measured by displacement of 125I-PTH(3–34) binding in the presence of 30 μm GTPγS. For the latter we developed a new radioligand that selectively labels the RG state,125I-[MAP22–31,Tyr36]PTHrP(1–36), an analogue of the bone anabolic agent RS-66271 (40Vickery B.H. Avnur Z. Cheng Y. Chiou S.S. Leaffer D. Caulfield J.P. Kimmel D.B. Ho T. Krstenansky J.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1943-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The R/RG selectivity of this radioligand was demonstrated by the 78% reduction of binding produced by GTPγS, which breaks down the RG complex (47Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar), and by the increase of binding produced by coexpression of the PTH1 receptor with a mutant Gαs G-protein, Gαs(α3/β5), that stabilizes the RG state ((43) Fig. 8). All agonist ligands bound with higher affinity to the RG complex than to the uncoupled receptor, whereas antagonist ligands bound with similar affinity to these states, confirming the findings of previous studies of the PTH1 receptor (48Hoare S.R.J. de Vries G. Usdin T.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1323-1333PubMed Google Scholar,53Teitelbaum A.P. Nissenson R.A. Arnaud C.D. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1524-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in agreement with a large number of studies of type I GPCRs (38Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that agonists enhance G-protein activation by stabilizing the RG state. For other GPCRs, measurement of ligand binding to R and RG states for a range of agonists has been used to test models of ligand-receptor-G-protein interaction. In this study we obtained estimates of the difference of ligand affinity for R and RG states (Ki(GTPγS)/K i(high)) and the fraction of 125I-[MAP]PTHrP(1–36) binding displaced with high affinity by the unlabeled ligand (%(high)). The binding data in this study cannot be accounted for by the simplest form of the ternary complex model, since there was no correlation between these two measurements (39De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy suggests additional states of the receptor (such as the active and inactive forms of the receptor proposed in the extended ternary complex model (38Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar)) and/or additional states of the G-protein in complex with the receptor. With respect to the latter, the role of the G-protein βγ dimer in agonist binding to the PTH1 receptor remains to be determined. For type I GPCRs the βγ dimer does not detectably affect agonist binding alone but is required together with the α-subunit for the detection of the high affinity agonist binding ternary complex state (54Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Figler R.A. Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar).Since the macro-affinity of agonist ligands was increased by R-G interaction, we next investigated the extent to which the micro-affinity constants within the two-site binding mechanism (K N and/or K NJ) were affected by R-G coupling. Modification of the N-terminal region of the ligand altered the RG/R binding selectivity as follows. 1) Removal of the two N-terminal residues from PTH(1–34) resulted in the loss of RG/R selectivity. 2) Replacement of His5 of [MAP]PTHrP(1–36) with Ile reduced the RG/R selectivity from 97- to 17-fold, demonstrating a previously unknown role for residue 5 in the control of RG/R binding selectivity. These findings suggest that the affinity of ligand interaction with the J domain is increased by RG interaction, a hypothesis strongly supported by the detection of selective binding of PTH(1–14) to the RG state. In contrast ligand binding to the N domain is not appreciably sensitive to RG coupling; PTH(3–34) bound with similar affinity to the R and RG states of the receptor. Therefore, agonists enhance R-G interaction through ligand interaction with the J domain (K NJ) and not through ligand binding to the N domain (K N) (Fig. 9).An increase of ligand affinity for RG compared with R indicates different receptor conformations at the G-protein-coupled and -uncoupled receptor states. At the uncoupled receptor, the allosteric binding data suggest than the conformation is open enough to permit the simultaneous binding of PTH(1–14) and PTH(3–34). For the RG state, three observations are consistent with the hypothesis of a more closed receptor conformation. 1) Agonist binding is pseudo-irreversible, suggesting that the ligand is trapped within the ligand-receptor-G-protein complex (48Hoare S.R.J. de Vries G. Usdin T.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1323-1333PubMed Google Scholar). 2) PTH(1–14) produces a greater reduction of the binding affinity of PTH(3–34) at the RG state, suggesting that simultaneous binding of one ligand better occludes binding of the second. 3) PTH(3–34) reduces theE max of PTH(1–14)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. This suggests a reduced ability of the PTH1 receptor to adopt an active conformation that couples to G-proteins when both PTH(3–34) and PTH(1–14) are bound to the receptor. The terms open and closed are used operationally in this model. We offer no structural interpretation of the postulated open and closed states, since such an interpretation is beyond the scope of the present data. The hypothesis, currently based on indirect measurements of receptor conformation (ligand binding data), requires more direct examination.Whereas this study has focused on the conformation of the receptor, the conformation of the ligand when bound to the receptor is largely unknown. For the free peptide, a recent crystal structure of PTH(1–34) indicates an extended helical conformation (33Jin L. Briggs S.L. Chandrasekhar S. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Schevitz R.W. Smiley D.L. Tashjian A.H. Zhang F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27238-27244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies of PTH and PTHrP under secondary structure-inducing conditions are consistent with an α-helix in the N- and C-terminal portions linked by a region of variable structure (34Pellegrini M.

In this study, a comparison of the binding of PTH(3–34) and PTH(7–34) is difficult to reconcile with the extended conformation hypothesis. PTH(7–34) binds with much lower affinity to the PTH1 receptor than PTH(3–34). However, the weak effect of PTH(1–14) binding on the affinity of PTH(3–34) suggests that very little of the binding energy of PTH(3–34) is provided by receptor interactions involving the 3–14 portion of the ligand. As a result, the large loss of affinity resulting from deletion of resides 3–6 is difficult to explain by the loss of a strong direct interaction of this region of the ligand with the juxtamembrane region of the receptor. The effect could be accounted for by the loss of intramolecular stabilization interactions within the ligand, which result in the reduction of affinity of the 15–34 ligand region with the receptor.In conclusion, for the first time we have extended the two-site model to take into account different conformations of the PTH1 r"

Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have a crucial role in chondrogenesis, but their mechanisms of action are not well defined. IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is the major carrier for circulating IGFs in postnatal life, and has been shown to have IGF-independent effects on proliferation of several cancer cell lines. In this study, we have evaluated the IGF-independent and -dependent effects of IGFBP-3 on chondrocyte proliferation and the relationship of these effects with chondrocyte differentiation stage. We used the RCJ3.1C5.18 nontransformed mesenchymal chondrogenic cell line, which, over 2 weeks of culture, progresses through the differentiation pathway exhibited by chondrocytes in the growth plate. We demonstrated that IGFBP-3 inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner (1–30 nm), the proliferation of chondroprogenitors and early differentiated chondrocytes, stimulated by des-(1–3)-IGF-I and longR3-IGF-I (IGF-I analogs with reduced affinity for IGFBP-3), and by insulin and IGF-I. In terminally differentiated chondrocytes, IGFBP-3 retained the ability to inhibit cell proliferation stimulated by IGF-I, but had no effect on cell growth stimulated by insulin, or des-(1–3)-IGF-I or longR3IGF-I. By monolayer affinity cross-linking, we demonstrated a specific IGFBP-3-associated cell-membrane protein of ∼20 kDa. We determined that IGFBP-3 has an antiproliferative effect on chondrocytes and, that this effect is related to the differentiation process. In chondroprogenitors and early differentiated chondrocytes, antiproliferative effect of IGFBP-3 is mainly IGF-independent, whereas, following terminal differentiation this effect is IGF-dependent.

Mesenchymally derived growth plate chondrocytes proliferate and terminally differentiate to produce a cartilage template for linear growth. Several growth factors are involved in this process, but how this tightly ordered equilibrium is controlled is still not well understood. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)1 appear to play a central role in chondrogenesis, but studies directed at clarifying the precise mechanisms of IGF action have led to contradictory results and theories (1Spagnoli A. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 615-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The somatomedin hypothesis postulates that IGF-I produced in extraskeletal tissues is transported to the growth plate, where it acts as an endocrine factor. The dual effector theory advocates that IGF-I is produced in the growth plate under the stimulation of growth hormone (GH) and acts as a paracrine/autocrine factor; GH may also act independently, by promoting the differentiation of resting chondrocytes to chondrocytes (1Spagnoli A. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 615-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, to date, clinical and experimental evidence does not definitively support either theory. Moreover, the regulatory action of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) in chondrogenesis requires careful evaluations. IGFBPs are part of an IGFBP/IGFBP-related-protein superfamily, of which six proteins (termed IGFBP-1 to -6) bind IGFs with high affinity (3Rosenfeld R.G. Hwa V. Wilson L. Lopez-Bermejo A. Buckway C. Burren C. Choi W.K. Devi G. Ingermann A. Graham D. Minniti G. Spagnoli A. Oh Y. Pediatrics. 1999; 104: 21-1018Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 is the major circulating IGFBP present during postnatal life (2Spagnoli A. Rosenfeld R.G. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1997; 4: 1-9Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 is GH-dependent, prolongs IGF half-life, and carries IGF to target tissues. In addition, a direct effect of IGFBP-3 on cell proliferation that is independent of IGF binding has been demonstrated in several cell lines, and this effect may involve association with cell-membrane proteins (2Spagnoli A. Rosenfeld R.G. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1997; 4: 1-9Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol.

Based upon an increasing understanding of the IGFBP system, we have recently proposed an IGFBP regulatory hypothesis as part of an integrated model of the GH-IGF-IGFBP-3 effects in the growth process (1Spagnoli A. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 615-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The proposed model accounts for the effects of circulating IGFBPs, but the possibility of a direct, IGF-independent effect of IGFBP-3 on the growth plate has yet to be addressed. Studies directed at the evaluation of IGFBPs in chondrogenesis have produced contradictory findings, primarily due to the lack of a goodin vitro model. In most studies, primary cultures of chondrocytes have been used. Under these conditions, however, the chondrocytes undergo a process that has been termed dedifferentiation (6Takigawa M. Shirai E. Fukuo K. Tajima K. Mori Y. Suzuki F. Bone Miner. 1987; 2: 449-462PubMed Google Scholar), which is characterized by a change in shape, attachment, and a loss of cartilage-specific markers. Despite these limitations, receptors for IGFs and GH have been identified in chondrocytes (7Barnard R. Haynes K.M. Werther G.A Waters M.J.

Gargosky S.E. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 148: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas others have reported that IGFBP-2 is the most abundant IGFBP in cultured chondrocytes (13Sunic D. Belford D. McNeil J.D. Wiebkin O.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have employed a nontransformed clonal chondrogenic cell line, RCJ3.1C5.18. The RCJ3.1C5.18 cell line is a mesenchymal stem cell system that, without requiring biochemical or oncogenic transformation, spontaneously and sequentially undergoes chondrocyte differentiation (14Lunstrum G.P.

Although our data are based upon an in vitrosituation the morphology, the histochemical markers and the temporal sequential acquisition of the chondrocytic phenotype in this cell system is identical to the chondrogenesis process that occurs in vivo. This makes our system ideal and unique for studying chondrocyte cellular and molecular regulation, and suggests that our findings are relevant to the in vivo process.Table IChondrocyte differentiation markers sequentially acquired by RCJ3.1C5.18 cells over 2 weeks of culture (14Lunstrum G.P.

Human recombinant IGF-I, des-(1–3)-IGF-I (des-IGF-I), and longR3 (LR3-IGF-I) IGF-I were purchased from GroPep Pty. Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). Des-(1–3)-IGF- and LR3-IGF-I exhibit 30–100-fold reduced affinity for IGFBP-3, but unaltered affinity for the type I IGF receptor compared with IGFs (17Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lee D. Fielder P.J.

Fetal bovine serum, α-minimal essential medium, and sodium pyruvate were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Dexamethasone and β-glycerophosphate were obtained from Sigma. Ascorbic acid was obtained from Wako Pure Biochemicals Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). RCJ3.1C5.18 cells, generously donated by Dr. Jane E. Aubin (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10−7m dexamethasone, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in six-well dishes. After reaching confluence (4 days), fresh growth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate was added. Differentiating cells were fed again with supplemented medium at days 7 and 10 of culture. Cultures were monitored over a total period of 14 days. We have previously shown that RCJ3.1C5.18 cells grown in this manner maintain their differentiated chondrocytic phenotype (14Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Weksler N.B. Cho Y.J. Cornwall M. Horton W.A. J.

As shown in TableI, cells sequentially acquire at 7 days of culture markers of chondrocytic differentiation (type II collagen and proteoglycans synthesis) and progressively acquire at 10 and 14 days of culture markers of terminal differentiation (type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase activity). Cell lysates were obtained from cells cultured for 4, 7, 10, and 14 days, and conditioned media were obtained from cells cultured similarly but incubated for 24 h in serum-free media. For preparation of cell lysates, cells were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) including 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). Conditioned media (100 μl), cell lysates (10 μg of proteins), or rat serum (2 μl) were subjected to Western ligand blot analysis (WLB); a mixture of 125I-IGF-I and125I-IGF-II (1.5 × 106 cpm of each) was used as described previously (19Gargosky S.E.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells, as described by the manufacturer, using RNeasy columns (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) and quantified by spectrophotometric analysis. Northern blotting analysis was performed as described previously (12Matsumoto T. Gargosky S.E. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J.

RNase protection assays were conducted with 25-μg aliquots of total RNA using the Ambion RPA-II kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the supplier's protocol. The rat IGF-I and IGF-II probes used to generate antisense RNA probes have been described previously (26Lowe Jr., W.L. Lasky S.R. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Mol.

IGFBP-3 proteolysis was assessed in conditioned media using IGFBP-3 Western immunoblotting analysis (WIB) and an IGFBP-3 protease assay as described previously (28Lamson G. Giudice L.C. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 72: 1391-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells cultured for 4, 7, 10, and 14 days were washed with PBS and treated with recombinant human IGFBP-3 (30 nm) with or without IGF-I (15 nm) or des-(1–3)-IGF-I (15 nm) in serum-free media for 24 h. For IGFBP-3 WIB analysis, 100 μl of conditioned media were processed, filters were probed with αIGFBP-3g1 polyclonal antibody (19Gargosky S.E. Pham H.A. Wilson K.F. Liu F. Giudice L.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) reagents were used. For IGFBP-3 protease activity assay, 100 μl of conditioned media were incubated with glycosylated 125I-IGFBP-3 (30,000 cpm). Densitometric analysis was carried out using a GS700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). After 4, 7, 10, and 14 days of culture, cells were washed with PBS and changed to serum-free medium for 4 h. Cells were then incubated with specified peptides and [3H]thymidine (0.8 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium for 18 h. Incubations were terminated by washing with ice-cold PBS. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined as uptake of radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material, as described previously (29Beukers M.W. Oh Y. Zhang H. Ling N. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1201-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells at days 4, 7, 10, and 14 of culture were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h; cell monolayers were then trypsinized and cells counted in a hemocytometer. Affinity cross-linking of IGFBP-3 to cell monolayers was performed as described by Massaguéet al. (30Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Equilibrated cells were incubated with 125I-IGFBP-3 (700,000 cpm) for 4 h at 4 °C with or without the indicated amount of cold peptides.125I-IGFBP-3 ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked using 27 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cross-linking reaction mixture was aspirated and quenched by addition of 10 mm Tris-containing detachment buffer. The excess of Tris quenched the unreacted DSS in solution; samples were processed as rapidly as possible to rapidly achieve the complete quenching of residual DSS internalized into the cell compartments by adding SDS-sample buffer. Cells were detached, lysed, and cell debris removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation using α-IGFBP-3g1 antibody as reported previously (19Gargosky S.E. Pham H.A.

Immunoprecipitates were dissociated by SDS-sample buffer, boiled, centrifuged, and supernatants electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Gels were dried and exposed to film. Data are presented as means ± S.D. The statistical differences between means were assessed by unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. To determine the IGFBPs produced by RCJ3.1C5.18 cells, conditioned media and cell lysates were obtained after 4, 7, 10, and 14 days of culture and subjected to WLB analysis. As shown in Fig.1, the predominant IGF-labeled bands in conditioned media and cell lysate were 32–29 and 24 kDa (Fig. 1,lanes 1–4 and Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). To characterize the IGFBPs, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antisera against rat IGFBP-2 (αHEC 1) and rat IGFBP-4. In Fig. 1,lane 11 is the WLB of the cell lysate. Immunoprecipitation with pre-immune rabbit serum showed the absence of any nonspecific bands (Fig. 1, lanes 13 and 17). The antiserum against rat IGFBP-2 immunoprecipitated the 32-kDa band (Fig.1, lanes 14 and 15) and the antiserum against rat IGFBP-4 immunoprecipitated the 24-kDa band (Fig. 1, lane 18). The 29-kDa band identified by WLB was not immunoprecipitated by any of the antibodies employed and may, therefore, correspond to IGFBP-5. Northern blotting analysis was carried out, and IGFBP-5 mRNA was identified in RCJ3.1C5.18 cells (data not shown).Figure 5Dose-dependent IGFBP-3 effect on des-(1–3)-IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis.

To determine if the absence of intact IGFBP-3 was the result of specific conditioned media protease activity, conditioned media was subjected to protease assay. No IGFBP-3 proteolysis was detectable in conditioned media of chondrocytes at any time point of the culture (data not shown). We determined that no IGFBP-3 mRNA was present in RCJ3.1C5.18 cells at any stage of differentiation by Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4). RNase protection assays revealed that no IGF-I or IGF-II mRNA was expressed in RCJ3.1C5.18 cells at any stage of differentiation (Fig. 3, lanes 4–7 and lanes 8–12). The fact that no IGFBP-3, IGF-I, and IGF-II mRNAs were present in RCJ3.1C5.18 chondrogenic cells at any time point of the cell culture makes this an ideal system for studying the effects of IGFBP-3 and IGFs without interference from endogenous peptides.Figure 3Ribonuclease protection assays for IGF-I and IGF-II.

https://openalex.org/W2089100446,"Viral infection is one environmental factor that may initiate β-cell damage during the development of autoimmune diabetes. Formed during viral replication, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activates the antiviral response in infected cells. In combination, synthetic dsRNA (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, poly(I-C)) and interferon (IFN)-γ stimulate inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, inhibit insulin secretion, and induce islet degeneration. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) appears to mediate dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced islet damage in a nitric oxide-dependent manner, as the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein prevents dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression, inhibition of insulin secretion, and islet degeneration. IL-1β is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein that requires cleavage by the IL-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) for activation. dsRNA and IFN-γ stimulate IL-1β expression and ICE activation in primary β-cells, respectively. Selective ICE inhibition attenuates dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression by primary β-cells. In addition, poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by human islets are prevented by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein, indicating that human islets respond to dsRNA and IFN-γ in a manner similar to rat islets. These studies provide biochemical evidence for a novel mechanism by which viral infection may initiate β-cell damage during the development of autoimmune diabetes. The viral replicative intermediate dsRNA stimulates β-cell production of pro-IL-1β, and following cleavage to its mature form by IFN-γ-activated ICE, IL-1 then initiates β-cell damage in a nitric oxide-dependent fashion.

Diabetes. 1965; 14: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Triggering events that precipitate β-cell damage have remained elusive; however, evidence supports a role for viral infection in the initiation of autoimmune diabetes. Viruses have been isolated from pancreata, and virus-specific IgM antibodies have been identified in newly diagnosed diabetic patients (2Bach J.-F. Endocr.

Diabetes can be induced in genetically susceptible strains of mice, rats, and primates by infection with encephalomyocarditis virus, Coxsackie B4 virus, Kilham's rat virus, rubella virus, and retrovirus (3Yoon J.-W.

Encephalomyocarditis-induced diabetes in mice is associated with increased expression of iNOS1 and macrophage-derived cytokines IL-1β, IL-12, and TNF-α. Administration of neutralizing antisera for IL-1β or TNF or of the iNOS-selective inhibitor aminoguanidine attenuates diabetes development in this mouse model (5Hirasawa K. Jun H.S. Maeda K. Kawaguchi Y. Itagaki S. Mikami T. Baek H.S. Doi K. Yoon J.-W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4024-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro studies have identified cytokine-stimulated iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by β-cells as one mechanism by which IL-1 inhibits insulin secretion and induces islet damage (6Corbett J.A.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), formed during viral replication, is an active component of a viral infection that triggers antiviral responses in infected cells (8Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The antiviral response includes the expression of type 1 interferons (9Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. J.

Similar to a viral infection, the synthetic dsRNA molecule polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C)) also activates these antiviral responses (14Kreil T.R. Eibl M.M.

In vivo, administration of poly(I-C) to diabetes-resistant and -prone BioBreeding rats results in the induction and acceleration of diabetes, respectively (17Ewel C.H. Sobel D.O. Zeligs B.J.

Diabetes. 1992; 41: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although viral infection has been implicated in the development of autoimmune diabetes, the response of islets and specifically β-cells to a viral insult has been poorly defined. We have shown that dsRNA, in combination with IFN-γ, inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induces islet degeneration in a nitric oxide-dependent manner (19Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alone, neither poly(I-C) nor IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression or inhibits insulin secretion by rat islets (19Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In combination with IFN-γ, dsRNA also activates macrophages, stimulating iNOS expression, nitric oxide formation, and IL-1 release (11Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Islets contain 5–10 resident macrophages that express and release IL-1 when activated in response to TNF + LPS. Local accumulation of IL-1 in islets stimulates the expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide by β-cells resulting in a potent inhibition of insulin secretion and islet degeneration (20Arnush M.A. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the inhibitory and destructive effects of dsRNA + IFN-γ on insulin secretion and islet viability are mediated by the intra-islet production of IL-1. Furthermore, we show that β-cells themselves are a source of IL-1 in response to dsRNA and that β-cell production of IL-1 leads to IL-1- and nitric oxide-dependent inhibition of β-cell function. CMRL-1066 tissue culture medium,l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and rat recombinant IFN-γ were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased from Harlan Breeders (Indianapolis, IN). Poly(I-C) and collagenase type XI were from Sigma. [α-32P]dCTP and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human recombinant IL-1β was from Cistron Biotechnology (Pine Brook, NJ). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, FITC-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig, and CY3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Rabbit antiserum specific for the C-terminal 27 amino acids of mouse macrophage iNOS was a gift from Dr. Thomas Misko (G. D. Searle, St. Louis, MO). iNOS and cyclophilin cDNAs were gifts from Dr. Charles Rodi (Monsanto Corporate Research, St. Louis, MO) and Dr. Steve Carroll (Department of Pathology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL), respectively. Guinea pig anti-human insulin antibody was from Linco Research, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), and goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents were from commercially available sources. Islets were isolated from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (21McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Following isolation, islets were cultured overnight in complete CMRL-1066 (CMRL-1066 containing 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Prior to each experiment, islets were washed 3 times in complete CMRL-1066, counted, and then cultured for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Experiments were initiated by the addition of poly(I-C) and IFN-γ followed by culture for the indicated times. Where indicated, islets were pretreated for 30 min with IRAP prior to the addition of poly(I-C) and IFN-γ. The Islet Isolation Core Facility at Washington University School of Medicine and the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami provided human islets. Isolated human islets were cultured for 3 days at 37 °C in complete CMRL-1066 prior to experimentation. Where indicated, human islets were pretreated for 30 min with IRAP prior to incubation with cytokines and poly(I-C). Islets isolated from 12 rats were cultured overnight (∼1200 islets/3 ml) in complete CMRL-1066 media under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Islets were then dispersed into individual cells by treatment with trypsin (1.0 mg/ml) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks solution at 37 °C for 3 min as stated previously (21McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Dispersed islet cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in complete CMRL-1066 prior to cell sorting. Islet cells were purified as described previously (22Pipeleers D.G. Int Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) using a FACSTAR + flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The cells were illuminated at 488 nm, and emission was monitored at 515–535 nm. This procedure results in β- and α-cell purity of 90–95 and 80–85%, respectively. For RT-PCR analysis of IL-1α and IL-1β mRNA expression, narrow gated windows were used to enhance β-cell purity, which was greater than 98% based on post-sort FACS analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of insulin-containing cells (data not shown). Islets (220/ml of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 40 h with the indicated concentrations of poly(I-C), rat IFN-γ, and IRAP. The islets were isolated and washed three times in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB: 25 mmHepes, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 3 mmd-glucose, and insulin secretion was performed as described (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Medium insulin content was determined by radioimmunoassay (24Wright P.H. Makulu D.R. Vichick D. Sussman K.E. Diabetes. 1971; 20: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Islets (25/500 μl of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 96 h in 24-well microtiter plates with the indicated concentrations of poly(I-C), IFN-γ, and IRAP. Islet degeneration was determined in a double-blind manner by phase-contrast microscopic analysis. Islet degeneration is characterized by the loss of islet integrity, disintegration, and partial dispersion of islets as described previously (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol.

Rat or human islets (120/400 μl of complete CMRL-1066), cultured for the indicated times with poly(I-C), rat or human IFN-γ, and IRAP were isolated, lysed, and protein separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis as described (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Detection of iNOS was by ECL according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and as described previously (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Rat islets (900/3 ml complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 18 h at 37 °C with poly(I-C), rat IFN-γ, IRAP, and cycloheximide (CHX) as indicated. After culture, the islets were washed 3 times with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). RNA (5–10 μg) was denatured, fractionated, and transferred to Duralon UV nylon membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized to a 32P-labeled probe specific for rat iNOS or cyclophilin (27Brown R. Mackey K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struh L.K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1997: 4.9.1-4.9.13Google Scholar). The cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Prime-a-Gene nick translation system from Promega (Madison, WI). iNOS cDNA probe corresponds to bases 509–1415 of the rat iNOS coding region. Cyclophilin was used as an internal control for RNA loading. Hybridization and autoradiography were performed as described previously (28Burd P.R. Rogers H.W. Gordon J.R. Martin C.A. Jayaraman S. Wilson S.D. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Dorf M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Nitrite production was determined by mixing 50 μl of culture medium with 50 μl of Griess reagent (29Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 540 nm was measured, and nitrite concentrations were calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve. RT-PCR analysis of IL-1α and IL-1β mRNA accumulation by rat and human islets (100/condition) and FACS-purified β- and α-cells (100,000 cells/condition) was performed as described previously (20Arnush M.A. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar, 30Arnush M. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Marino M.A. Manning P.A. Corbett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). GAPDH mRNA accumulation was used as a control for PCRs, and total RNA isolated from rat islets treated for 4 h with TNF + LPS was used as a positive control for islet expression of IL-1α and IL-1β. We have previously shown that resident macrophages are the source of IL-1 in response to TNF + LPS (20Arnush M.A. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, rat islets (500 islets/ml of methionine-deficient minimum Eagle's medium) were treated for 18 h with poly(I-C) + IFN-γ. [35S]Methionine (500 μCi) was added, and the islets were cultured for 6 additional h. The islets were isolated, and lysed, and IL-1 was immunoprecipitated using hamster anti-IL-1α- and hamster anti-IL-1β-specific antisera as described (20Arnush M.A. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (20Arnush M.A. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, islets were isolated, dispersed into individual cells by trypsin treatment as stated above, and centrifuged onto slides. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline). ICE was identified using rabbit anti-mouse ICE (1:40 dilution) antiserum specific for the p10 active form of ICE, IL-1β was identified using goat anti-rat IL-1β antiserum (1:20 dilution), and insulin was identified using guinea pig anti-human insulin (1:200 dilution). Secondary antibodies included FITC- or CY3-conjugated donkey anti-rat, donkey anti-guinea pig, and donkey anti-mouse antisera (1:200 dilution). All figures for immunohistochemistry were at a × 40 magnification. To determine whether the endogenous production of IL-1 is required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced damage, islets were incubated for 40 h with dsRNA and IFN-γ in the presence or absence of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP). IRAP competes with IL-1 for receptor binding and thereby prevents IL-1-induced signaling events (31Arend W.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat islets with dsRNA + IFN-γ results in a 2.5-fold increase in nitrite production (poly(I-C) + IFN-γ treated, 30 pmol/islet; untreated, 12 pmol/islet). In a concentration-dependent manner, IRAP prevents poly(I-C) + IFN-γ-induced nitrite formation with maximal ∼70% inhibition at 1–10 μg/ml (Fig.1 a). We have recently shown that dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS mRNA accumulation and protein expression are maximal following 18- and 40-h incubations, respectively, and that concentrations of 50 μg/ml poly(I-C) + 150 units/ml IFN-γ stimulate maximal iNOS expression and nitrite formation by rat islets (19Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 b, IRAP prevents dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS mRNA accumulation following an 18-h incubation. IRAP also prevents dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS protein expression following a 40-h incubation (Fig. 1 c). Alone, neither IFN-γ nor dsRNA stimulates iNOS expression or nitrite formation by rat islets (Fig. 1 b and Ref. 19Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with a requirement for IL-1 production, dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS mRNA accumulation requires de novo protein synthesis. CHX, at a concentration (10 μm) that inhibits islet total protein synthesis by greater than 95% (32Hughes J.H. Colca J.R. Easom R.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin.

Importantly, CHX (at 10 μm) does not alter the levels of iNOS mRNA that accumulate in response to 1 unit/ml IL-1, nor does CHX inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by rat islets (6Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Nitric Oxide: Principles and Action. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 177-217Crossref Google Scholar, 32Hughes J.H. Colca J.R. Easom R.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results show that de novoprotein synthesis is required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression by rat islets and suggest that dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitrite formation is mediated by the intra-islet release of IL-1. We have previously shown that dsRNA + IFN-γ inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induces islet degeneration in a nitric oxide-dependent manner (19Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibitory and destructive effects of dsRNA + IFN-γ are mediated by the intra-islet release of IL-1, rat islets were incubated for 40 (insulin secretion) or 96 h (islet viability) with 50 μg/ml poly(I-C) + 150 units/ml IFN-γ in the presence or absence of IRAP. As shown in Fig. 2, dsRNA + IFN-γ inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induces the degeneration of 89% of islets. IRAP prevents the inhibitory effects of dsRNA + IFN-γ on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and attenuates islet degeneration by ∼75%. These results indicate that dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced inhibition of insulin secretion, and induction of islet degeneration is mediated by IL-1. To examine whether β-cells are a source of IL-1 in response to dsRNA + IFN-γ, primary β-cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were incubated with poly(I-C) and IFN-γ in the presence or absence of IRAP. Following a 40-h incubation, β-cells express high levels of iNOS in response to dsRNA + IFN-γ (Fig. 3). IRAP prevents dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression by FACS-purified β-cells, indicating that β-cells may be one islet cellular source of IL-1. Alone, neither dsRNA nor IFN-γ induces iNOS expression by FACS-purified β-cells, and dsRNA and IFN-γ, alone or in combination, fail to induce iNOS expression by FACS-purified α-cells (data not shown). Two isoforms of IL-1 have been identified, IL-1α and IL-1β. To determine the isoform(s) of IL-1 expressed by β-cells, the effects of dsRNA and IFN-γ on IL-1α and IL-1β mRNA accumulation were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoprecipitation. Treatment of FACS-purified β-cells with poly(I-C) or poly(I-C) + IFN-γ results in IL-1β mRNA accumulation following an 18-h incubation (Fig.4 a). FACS-purified α-cells fail to express either IL-1α or IL-1β (data not shown), and FACS-purified β-cells fail to express IL-1α in response to either poly(I-C), IFN-γ, or poly(I-C) + IFN-γ (Fig. 4 a). In rat islets, poly(I-C) and poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulate both IL-1α and IL-1β mRNA accumulation that is first apparent following a 12-h incubation and that persists for up to 24 h (Fig. 4 b). Resident macrophages appear to be the islet cellular source of IL-1α, as dsRNA + IFN-γ fails to stimulate IL-1α mRNA accumulation in islets depleted of resident macrophages (data not shown) and primary β-cells purified by FACS (Fig. 4 a). These results indicate that dsRNA alone stimulates IL-1β expression by primary β-cells. To confirm that IL-1 is expressed at the protein level in response to dsRNA + IFN-γ, IL-1α and IL-1β were sequentially immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled rat islets using hamster monoclonal antisera previously used to immunoprecipitate both the pro-forms and mature forms of IL-1α and IL-1β from activated macrophages (33Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22672-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulates the expression of immunoprecipitable pro-IL-1β from isolated rat islets following a 24-h incubation (Fig. 4 c). We were unable to immunoprecipitate IL-1α from rat islets, a finding that is consistent with IL-1α expression by the limited number of macrophages found in rat islets (∼10/islet). Also, we were unable to immunoprecipitate the mature form of IL-1β from islets, consistent with its release following proteolytic processing (Fig. 4 c(34Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar)). To confirm directly that β-cells are a source of IL-1β, islets were treated for 18 h with poly(I-C) or poly(I-C) + IRAP, isolated, and dispersed into individual cells, and IL-1β expressing cells were identified by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 5 a, treatment of rat islets with poly(I-C) results in IL-1β expression (redfluorescence), and IL-1β immunoreactivity localizes with insulin-containing cells (green fluorescence), as indicated by the yellow fluorescence following double exposure. To control for IL-1β binding to cell membranes, rat islets were treated for 18 h with poly(I-C) + IRAP. Under these conditions, IRAP should antagonize the interactions of IL-1β with its surface receptors on β-cells. As shown in Fig. 5 b, IL-1β expression (green fluorescence) localizes to insulin-containing cells (red fluorescence), as indicated by the yellow following double exposure. Similar results were obtained from islets treated for 18 h with poly(I-C) + IFN-γ and poly(I-C) + IFN-γ + IRAP (data not shown). In addition, IL-1β was not expressed in untreated islets nor was it expressed in islets treated for 18 h with IFN-γ (data not shown). Whereas β-cells express high levels of IL-1β, less than 1% of islet cells express this cytokine in response to poly(I-C). As expected, poly(I-C) also stimulates IL-1β expression by a second population of islet cells that appear to be resident macrophages. As shown in Fig. 5 b, IL-1β immunoreactivity localizes with a large highly vacuolized cell containing a high degree of macrophage morphology. To confirm that these cells are macrophages, islets were treated for 5 h with TNF + LPS. We have previously shown that macrophages are the sole islet cellular source of IL-1β under these conditions (20Arnush M.A. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 c, a 5-h incubation of islets with TNF + LPS results in the expression of IL-1β (red fluorescence) by resident macrophages. The morphology of the IL-1β expressing macrophages in Fig. 5, b andc, are nearly identical. Similar numbers of macrophages express IL-1β in response poly(I-C) as compared with TNF + LPS. These findings provide direct support for β-cell expression of IL-1β and that resident islet macrophages also produce this cytokine in response to poly(I-C).

In this experiment, islets were treated for 40 h with 50 μg/ml poly(I-C), 150 units/ml IFN-γ, or both poly(I-C) and IFN-γ; the culture supernatant was isolated and IL-1 levels quantitated. Alone, neither IFN-γ nor poly(I-C) stimulate IL-1 release by islets; however, poly(I-C) + IFN-γ stimulates the accumulation of 32.6 ± 1.2 pg/ml of IL-1. We have previously shown that this level of IL-1 is sufficient to stimulate iNOS expression by β-cells in the presence of IFN-γ (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol.

S6K2 is highly homologous to S6K1 in the core kinase and linker regulatory domains but differs from S6K1 in the N- and C-terminal regions and is differently localized primarily to the nucleus because of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal unique to S6K2. We have recently demonstrated that S6K2 is regulated similarly to S6K1 by the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and by multiple PI3-K pathway effectors in vivo. However, deletion of the C-terminal domain of S6K2 enhances kinase activity, whereas analogous deletion of S6K1 is inhibitory. Here, we characterize the S6K2 C-terminal motifs that confer this differential regulation. We demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of the S6K2 C-terminal domain are only partly attributable to the nuclear localization signal but that three C-terminal proline-directed potential mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation sites are critical mediators of this inhibitory effect. Site-specific mutation of these sites to alanine completely desensitizes S6K2 to activating inputs, whereas mutation to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation results in an activated enzyme which is hypersensitive to activating inputs. Pretreatment of cells with the mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 inhibited S6K2 activation to a greater extent than S6K1. Furthermore, S6K2 mutants with C-terminal deletion or acidic phosphorylation site mutations displayed greatly reduced U0126 sensitivity. Thus, MEK-dependent inputs to C-terminal phosphorylation sites appear to be essential for relief of S6K2 inhibition but less critical for activation of S6K1. These data suggest a mechanism by which weak PI3-K agonists can regulate S6 phosphorylation and selective translation in the presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.

This critical translational response that regulates ribosome biosynthesis is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)1(1Dufner A. Thomas G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Drosophila and mice lacking S6K1 exhibit a small animal phenotype, implicating this kinase in regulation of cell size (3Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G.

However, S6 phosphorylation and 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract-containing mRNA translation appear normal in cells derived from mice lacking S6K1, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for these functions. S6K2, a mitogen-responsive S6K1 homolog, has recently been identified by our lab and others as a candidate for the compensatory S6 kinase (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite a high degree of sequence homology between S6K1 and S6K2 overall, it is likely that their physiological functions do not overlap entirely. The small size phenotype persists in the S6K1-deleted mice despite the presence of S6K2 (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both isoforms (βI and βII) of S6K2 appear to be localized primarily to the nucleus because of a C-terminal nuclear localization sequence (6Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 70-kDa αII S6K1 isoform is predominantly cytosolic, but the 85-kDa αI isoform, which contains an N-terminal nuclear localization sequence, is nuclear (8Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4052-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Finally, there are regions in the N- and C-terminal domains of S6K2 that lack homology to S6K1 (5Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). S6K2 shares a conserved four domain organization with S6K1. Both contain a highly conserved core catalytic kinase domain and linker regulatory region. Interaction between regulatory N-terminal acidic and C-terminal basic domains is thought to maintain S6K1 in an inactive conformation in unstimulated cells. In this inactive state, a pseudosubstrate region in the C terminus may occlude the catalytic site. Phosphorylation of C-terminal proline-directed motifs is thought to disrupt the autoinhibitory interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains, exposing other critical regulatory sites in the linker and catalytic regions (9Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10Weng Q. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell.

Three of the four C-terminal proline-directed sites, as well as other mitogen-stimulated regulatory phosphorylation sites identified in S6K1, are conserved in S6K2, suggesting that these related kinases may share similar activation mechanisms. Several studies have implicated MEK-dependent signals in regulation of the S6K1 C-terminal proline-directed sites (11Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

We have recently determined that S6K1 and S6K2 are regulated similarly by effectors of the PI3-K pathway, including Cdc42, Rac, protein kinase Cζ, and PDK1 (15Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C.R.

Both kinases are also activated by overexpression of Akt/protein kinase B (7Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Inhibition of S6K1 and S6K2 activity by rapamycin treatment of cells implicates them as effectors of the nutrient-sensitive mammalian target of rapamycin pathway (6Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, we recently reported a major difference in the role of the C-terminal domain in S6K2 regulation. Deletion of the C-terminal domain of S6K2 enhances basal kinase activity and renders S6K2 hypersensitive to activation by growth factors and PI3-K-regulated effectors (15Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C.R. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the analogous region of S6K1 inhibits kinase activity and does not result in the dramatic potentiation of activation seen with S6K2. Here, we explore the roles of the unique features of the C-terminal region of S6K2 to address the mechanism of S6K2 regulation. We find that nuclear localization contributes to the lesser activity of S6K2 but is not the primary inhibitory influence on its activity. We report that the proline-directed phosphorylation sites are essential for activation of full-length S6K2 but not S6K1 and that these sites confer greater sensitivity of S6K2 to MEK-inhibition than S6K1. Eukaryotic expression vectors encoding rat p70 S6K1 αII (HA-S6K1/pRK7) or human p54 S6K2 βII (HA-S6K2/pcDNA3) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter have been described (6Lee-Fruman K.K.

Where indicated, the gel was immunoblotted with α-HA antibody to verify equal immunoprecipitation of HA-S6Ks. The PI3-K and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways contribute to the mitogen-dependent activation of S6K1 and S6K2. These kinases are highly homologous overall but diverge in the N- and C-terminal domains. Because deletion of the C-terminal domain dramatically potentiates S6K2 activation (15Martin K.A. Schalm S.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas truncation of S6K1 is inhibitory (9Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Because the C-terminal domain of S6K2 contains several features distinct from S6K1, we isolated the effects of these differences by mutagenesis. Two unique features of the S6K2 C terminus are the presence of a polyproline-rich domain and a nuclear localization sequence. Previous analysis of the polyproline-rich domain suggests that its deletion does not affect S6K2 regulation (5Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, mutation of a single amino acid in the putative nuclear localization signal within the context of full-length HA-S6K2 (K474M) results in cytoplasmic localization of the kinase in transfected HEK293 cells by immunolocalization (7Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We assayed the ability of cotransfected Myc-PDK1 to activate the putative nuclear localization sequence point mutant HA-S6K2-K474M in HEK293 cells. This point mutant was activated to a greater extent than wild type HA-S6K2 by Myc-PDK1 (Fig. 1). However, this activity was intermediate between that of wild type and HA-S6K2-ΔCT, suggesting that although cytosolic localization of S6K2 facilitates its activation by PI3-K effectors, other features of the S6K2 C-terminal domain inhibit activation of the kinase. A common feature of the S6K1 and S6K2 C termini is the presence of several proline-directed phosphorylation sites. Mitogen-induced phosphorylation of four proline-directed motifs in the C terminus of S6K1 (Ser411, Ser418, Thr421, and Ser424) is thought to be an early step in S6K1 activation (18Ferrari S. Bannwarth W. Morley S.J. Totty N.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Three of these sites (Ser410, Ser417, and Ser423) are conserved in S6K2. To determine the contribution of these putative phosphorylation sites to regulation of S6K2, we mutated these sites to aspartic acid (HA-S6K2-D3) to mimic phosphorylation or to alanine (HA-S6K2-A3) to prevent phosphorylation. We find that these sites play a major role in activation of S6K2, because HA-S6K2-D3 exhibits elevated basal and EGF- or insulin-stimulated activity similar to that of HA-S6K2-ΔCT in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2), whereas substitution of two of these sites to alanine (S417A, S423A results in an inactive HA-S6K2-A2 mutant (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, when all three sites are mutated to alanine, the HA-S6K2-A3 cannot be activated by EGF (see Fig. 7) or insulin stimulation (data not shown). These findings indicate that these C-terminal phosphorylation sites are essential for activation of the full-length kinase. This is surprising because mutation of the corresponding sites in S6K1 to alanine (A4) reduces kinase activity 5-fold, but the kinase retains mitogen-responsive activity (see Fig. 7) (19Ferrari S. Pearson R.B. Siegmann M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16091-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like HA-S6K2-ΔCT (15Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), HA-S6K2-D3 is hypersensitive to activation by insulin, PDK1, or Cdc42V12 (Fig.3). Notably, the analogous acidic mutant of S6K1, HA-S6K1-D3E (S411D, S418D, T421E, and S424D), demonstrates elevated basal and insulin-stimulated activity but is not hypersensitive to Cdc42V12 or PDK1 (data not shown). In multiple experiments, HA-S6K2-ΔCT and -D3 mutants exhibit comparable activities, suggesting that these three sites may largely account for the inhibitory effect conferred by the intact C-terminal domain.Figure 7Alanine mutation of the C-terminal proline-directed motifs results in greater inhibition of HA-S6K2 than HA-S6K1. HEK293 cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of HA-S6K2 wild type (wt) or 1.25 μg of A3 constructs in pcDNA3 or 0.5 μg of HA-S6K1 wild type or A4 mutant in pRK7.

To determine whether S6K2 activation requires this pathway, HEK293 cells transfected with HA-S6K2 or HA-S6K1 were treated with varying doses of the MEK inhibitor U0126 prior to stimulation with EGF. EGF-stimulated HA-S6K1 activity was modestly inhibited (0–30% inhibition, n= 4) by maximal doses (5–10 μm) of U0126 in multiple experiments (Fig. 4 A; see also Fig. 7). By contrast, EGF-stimulation of HA-S6K2 was potently inhibited by U0126 in a dose-dependent manner, with 50–90% inhibition by maximal doses of U0126 in multiple experiments (Fig. 4; see also Figs. 6 and 7). HA-S6K2 is also potently inhibited by U0126 in U2OS cells (Fig. 4 B). The greater sensitivity of S6K2 relative to S6K1 was also noted in assays of the endogenous kinases in HEK293 (93% inhibition of S6K2, 45% inhibition of S6K1; Fig.5 A) and U2OS cells (Fig.5 B), suggesting that MEK-regulated kinases may be more important for activation of S6K2 than S6K1.Figure 6Activating C-terminal HA-S6K2 mutations reduce sensitivity to U0126.

Data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify potential targets of the MEK pathway in S6K2, we assessed the effects of U0126 on the HA-S6K2 C-terminal mutants. EGF-stimulated activity of the D3 or ΔCT HA-S6K2 mutants was partially sensitive to U0126 but to a lesser extent than wild type (Fig.6). HA-S6K2-A3 exhibits only low basal activity that is unresponsive to mitogen stimulation. Thus, no further inhibition of this mutant was observed with U0126 (Fig.7). Notably, the EGF-stimulated activity of HA-S6K1-A4 was insensitive to U0126 (Fig. 7). The C-terminal proline-directed motifs appear to be MEK-regulated in both S6K1 and S6K2. However, we demonstrate that the HA-S6K2-D3 and ΔCT mutants are partially sensitive to MEK inhibition, whereas HA-S6K1-A4 is resistant to U0126. These data suggest that in S6K2, other sites outside the C terminus may integrate additional MEK-dependent inputs. In contrast, the C-terminal sites appear to be the major determinants of MEK-sensitivity in S6K1. We have employed EGF in these studies because it is an agonist for both S6K and ERK activation. However, at physiological levels of insulin receptor, insulin is a potent activator of S6K1 and S6K2 but a poor agonist for ERKs (11Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to EGF, we find that insulin-stimulated HA-S6K2 activity is insensitive to U0126 (Fig.8), suggesting that MEK-independent signals relieve S6K2 autoinhibition in response to insulin. Thus, EGF and insulin activation of S6K2 may employ distinct signal transduction mechanisms. Studies in mice lacking S6K1 reveal that S6K1 and S6K2 may mediate both common and nonredundant functions in vivo. S6K2 possesses unique regions of primary structure, as well as a primarily nuclear subcellular localization distinct from S6K1. Understanding the regulation of these related kinases may provide insight into the physiological functions unique to each kinase. We have recently demonstrated similarities and notable differences in the regulation of S6K1 and S6K2 by PI3-K pathway effectors. Of particular interest is the observation that the C-terminal domain of S6K2 mediates a potent inhibitory influence on kinase activity; deletion of the C terminus of S6K2 activates the kinase, whereas analogous deletion of S6K1 is inhibitory (15Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C.R. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, we dissect the roles of the distinct features of the S6K2 C terminus and conclude that the proline-directed phosphorylation sites are MEK-regulated and contribute the major regulatory influence of this domain on S6K2 kinase activity. A conspicuous feature unique to the C terminus of S6K2 is the nuclear localization signal. Disruption of this basic sequence by a single point mutation (K474M) confers predominantly cytosolic expression to HA-S6K2-K474M as assayed by immunofluorescence (7Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that this mutant is more sensitive to activation by insulin or cotransfected PI3-K effectors. However, cytosolic localization alone does not account for the dramatic potentiation of the S6K2-ΔCT mutant, because HA-S6K2-ΔCT is significantly more active than HA-S6K2-K474M. Activation of wild type S6K2 by cytosolic proteins such as Cdc42 and PDK1 suggests that the kinase may exit the nucleus during the course of its activation. It is likely that cytosolic localization of the K474M mutant facilitates interaction with cytosolic S6K2 activators. However, as the nuclear localization sequence is rich in basic residues, it is also possible that disruption of the basic sequence itself may lessen the inhibitory potential of the C terminus. The S6K2 proline-directed phosphorylation sites appear to play an essential role in relieving S6K2 autoinhibition. In fact, acidic substitution of these sites (S6K2-D3) results in a mutant that is regulated very similarly to S6K2-ΔCT, suggesting that phosphorylation of these sites is sufficient to disrupt C-terminal mediated inhibitory intermolecular or intramolecular interactions. The current model of S6K1 activation based on structure function analyses postulates that an interaction between basic residues in the C-terminal pseudosubstrate domain and an acidic region in the N terminus contributes to kinase autoinhibition, which is disrupted by mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of the C-terminal proline-directed sites. The acidic residues are conserved between the S6K1 and S6K2 N termini, suggesting that this mechanism may also apply to S6K2. However, the kinases diverge completely between the end of the acidic region and beginning of the conserved catalytic domain. It is possible that the divergent N- and C-terminal regions of S6K2 may form a stronger autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction than occurs in S6K1, which may account for the diminished specific activity of S6K2 relative to S6K1. It is interesting to note that only three of the four mitogen-stimulated S6K1 proline-directed sites are conserved in human S6K2. It is attractive to speculate that the lesser mitogen-stimulated net negative charge because of three sites, in the context of a more basic C terminus (because of the basic nuclear localization signal) may render S6K2 more sensitive to autoinhibition via N- and C-terminal charge-dependent interaction. The enhanced sensitivity of S6K2-D3 to activation by PDK1 or Cdc42V12 relative to the corresponding S6K1-D3E mutant further supports a stronger influence of these C-terminal proline-directed sites in regulation of S6K2 than S6K1. Our data suggest that different kinases may phosphorylate the C-terminal proline-directed sites in response to different upstream signals and that MEK-dependent kinases play a more critical role in regulation of S6K2 than S6K1. We demonstrate that S6K2 is more sensitive than S6K1 to MEK inhibition by U0126. Further, it is likely that the C-terminal Ser-Pro motifs may be targets of MEK-dependent kinases, because S6K2-D3 and S6K2-ΔCT are less sensitive to U0126 inhibition than wild type S6K2. Residual MEK dependence could potentially be mediated by the proline-directed S370 site, because the analogous S6K1 S371 site, which is phosphorylated by an unknown kinase, is essential for S6K1 activity (20Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the residual EGF-stimulated activity of the HA-S6K1-A4 mutant is insensitive to U0126, suggesting that the C-terminal proline-directed motifs may be the major targets of the MEK pathway in S6K1 but that additional MEK-dependent inputs may regulate S6K2. The kinases that regulate the C-terminal sites in S6K1 and S6K2in vivo are not known, but ERK1/2 or cdc2 (M-phase promoting factor) can phosphorylate the S6K1 C terminus in vitro (21Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that Ras and Raf are neither necessary nor sufficient for S6K1 activation by mitogens (22Ming X. Burgering B.M.T. Wannstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Bos J.L. Kozma S. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, other data suggest a role for MEK-dependent signals in S6K1 activation. Inducible Raf, although less potent than serum stimulation, was reported to activate S6K1 in an ERK-independent manner (13Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Scott and Lawrence (11Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have shown that ERK1/2 are not involved in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 or of the rapamycin-sensitive translational regulator 4E-BP1/PHAS-I (eIF-4Ebinding protein1/phosphorylated heat- andacid-stable protein regulated byinsulin) but that the MEK inhibitor PD098059 blunts insulin stimulation of these events. A recent study also implicates a role for basal MEK activity, independent of ERK1/2, for phosphorylation of S6K1, 4E-BP1/PHAS-I and stimulation of protein synthesis in response to insulin or phorbol ester (12Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, our data demonstrate a modest inhibition of S6K1 when MEK is inhibited. It is likely that two distinct mechanisms, both requiring basal MEK activity, influence C-terminal regulation of S6K1 and S6K2. Our data demonstrate that MEK activity is essential for EGF stimulation of S6K2 but only partially contributes to S6K1 activation. By contrast, S6K2 activation by insulin is minimally affected by U0126, suggesting that different growth factors utilize distinct pathways to regulate S6K2. In the HEK293 cells utilized in this study, insulin is a potent agonist for PI3-K but a weak agonist for ERK1/2, whereas EGF is a less potent PI3-K agonist but a potent ERK activator. Based on our data, we hypothesize that in the presence of a strong PI3-K signal, MEK-independent kinases may be able to phosphorylate the S6K2 C terminus, whereas growth factors that are weaker PI3-K agonists may require MEK-dependent signals to stimulate C-terminal phosphorylation. Alternatively, insulin and EGF may activate other distinct pathways that influence the S6K2 C terminus. Deletion of the S6K1 gene by homologous recombination suggests that S6K1 and S6K2 may serve both distinct and common functions. Because S6 phosphorylation and 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract-containing mRNA translation are preserved in MEFs from S6K1-deficient mice (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that both S6K1 and S6K2 may mediate these functions. The small size phenotype of these mice, however, suggests that S6K1 may have functions for which S6K2 cannot entirely compensate (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primarily nuclear localization of both S6K2 isoforms also suggests that S6K2 may have targets discrete from those of the cytosolic p70 S6K1 isoform. We have demonstrated similarities in the pathways that regulate S6K1 and S6K2, as well as notable differences, particularly in regulation of the C-terminal domain. Differential regulation by MEK signaling, along with discrete subcellular localization, may confer specificity toward potentially unique substrates of these S6 kinases.

Furthermore, it was elegantly shown that ubiquinone (or menaquinone) accepts electrons generated by the formation of protein disulfide in E. coli(5Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple functions of ubiquinone have been proposed. The ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway, which is comprised of 10 steps including methylation, decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and isoprenoid transfer, has been studied genetically in respiratory-deficient mutants of E. coli and S. cerevisiae (6Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these organisms has a specific isoprenoid side chain length as part of the ubiquinone molecule, e.g. Q-6 for S. cerevisiae, Q-8 for E. coli, Q-9 for rat, and Q-10 for S. pombe and human. For this reason, ubiquinone species have been used for classification in microbial taxonomy (7Collins M.D. Jones D. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 316-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the side chain of ubiquinone is precisely defined by the action of polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases, but not by 4-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl-diphosphate transferases, which catalyze the condensation of 4-hydroxybenzoate and polyprenyl diphosphate (8Okada K.

When various polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase genes, such as the mutant GGPP synthase gene from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, the hexaprenyl-diphosphate synthase gene (COQ1) from S. cerevisiae, the heptaprenyl-diphosphate synthase gene fromHaemophilus influenzae, the octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase gene (ispB) from E. coli, the solanesyl-diphosphate synthase gene (sdsA) fromRhodobacter capsulatus, and the decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase gene (ddsA) from Gluconobacter suboxydans, are expressed in an S. cerevisiae COQ1mutant, each transformant produced mainly Q-5, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10, respectively (9Okada K.

When COQ2, which encodes 4-hydroxybenzoate-hexaprenyl-diphosphate transferase in S. cerevisiae, was expressed in an E. coli ubiA mutant cell line, the transformant produce Q-8, but not Q-6 (10Suzuki K. Ueda M. Yuasa M. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results indicate that prenyl-diphosphate synthase determines the chain length of ubiquinone and that 4-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyltransferases can accept the various isoprenoid chains as a substrate. In E. coli, ispB is an essential gene, responsible for the biosynthesis of both ubiquinone and menaquinone (11Okada K. Minehira M. Zhu X. Suzuki K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. J.

An E. coli ubiA mutant, which does not produce Q-8, is not able to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source, but can grow on glucose (10Suzuki K. Ueda M. Yuasa M. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H.

However, an E. coli ubiA − menA − mutant, which lacks both ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis genes, can grow only when a small amount of Q-8 is still produced by leakiness of the mutations. Thus,ubiA − menA − mutants with an absolute lack of production of Q-8 and menaquinone-8 cannot be isolated. Long-chain polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases (C40, C45, and C50) catalyze the condensation of FPP, which acts as a primer, and IPP to produce each prenyl diphosphate with various chain lengths. These enzymes possess seven conserved regions including two DDXXD motifs that are binding sites for the substrates in association with Mg2+ (13Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K.

Short-chain polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases (C15 and C20), such as FPP and GGPP synthases, have been identified in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals (15Kainou T. Kawamura K. Tanaka K. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the mechanisms that determine the chain length have been reported (16Ohnuma S.-i.

These amino acids were those at the fourth and fifth positions before an aspartate-rich motif in region II or one amino acid at the fifth position before this motif and two amino acids in region II. Recently, we reported that substitution of glycine for alanine before the first DDXXD motif in decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase allowed the enzyme to synthesize products with longer chain lengths (18Okada K. Kainou T. Tanaka K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the fifth amino acid before region II of long-chain polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases plays an important role in the mechanism of chain length determination (18Okada K. Kainou T. Tanaka K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Generally, polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases are known to function as a dimer. The medium-chain polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases (C30 and C35) from Micrococcus luteus BP26, B. stearothermophilus, and Bacillus subtilis are composed of heterodimers (19Zhang Y.-W. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1417-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GGPP synthase purified from bovine brain forms a homo-oligomer (150–195 kDa) (21Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the subunit structure of long-chain polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases remains to be determined. Recently, geranyl-diphosphate synthase isolated from spearmint (22Burke C.C. Wildung M.R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was found to form a heterodimer. One subunit has similarity with known prenyltransferases, and the other has similarity with the Arabidopsis GGR protein (23Scolnik P.A. Bartley G.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1343Google Scholar), but the aspartate-rich motifs are not conserved. In this study, we describe the mutational analysis of octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (IspB) from E. coli. From the analysis, we found that IspB forms a homodimer that is important for the determination of isoprenoid chain length.

Four oligonucleotide primers (MUT, R1 (for each mutational primer), T7, and T3) (see Table II) were used in amplifications. pKO56, which contains the open reading frame and downstream region of ispB, was used as template in PCRs. First, PCR was performed with the MUT and T3 primers in one reaction and with the R1 and T7 primers in another. An aliquot of each of the reaction mixtures was mixed in a new tube to form the heteroduplex ispB template, and full-length mutantispB was amplified with the T7 and T3 primers by PCR. This DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pBluescript KS(−). This construct was transformed intoE. coli DH10B and KO229 (ispB::cat) for analysis of enzyme activity and ubiquinone production.Table IIPrimers used to construct ispB mutants in this studyMutant namePrimer sequenceL31V5′-CTGATTGATCACTTGGACGT-3′I32V5′-ACTGATTGACCAGCTGGACGTCGGA-3′Y37A5′-TGACGATGTAAGCGCCTAACTGA-3′Y38A5′-GCTGACGATCGCATAGCCTAA-3′Y37A/Y38A5′-CCGCTGACGATCGCAGCGCCTAACTGATT-3′Y38A/R321VCombination of Y38A and R321VY61V5′-CATTTCCCTCGACGCCAACAGCT-3′F75A5′-CGTGTGGATAGCCTCGATCA-3′A79Y5′-GTAGCAGAGTATACGTGTGGAT-3′K170A5′-ACGCGCGGTTGCGCTATAGATA-3′K170G5′-ACGCGCGGTTCCGCTATAGATA-3′K235L5′-CAGCGTCGGTAAACCTTCGTT-3′R321A5′-TTAACGATCGGCTTGAACAGCG-3′R321D5′-TTAACGATCGTCTTGAACAGCG-3′R321V5′-TTAACGATCGACTTGAACAGCG-3′MUT5′-AGTGGAACCTCCGGGCAGCAGCAATTC-3′T35′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′T75′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′S25′-TCGAATTCTATGAATTTAGAAAAAATC-3′A35′-CGAAGCTTGGCCATGGGCGCGAT-3′QEGST5′-TCGGATCCGATGAATTTAGAAAAAATC-3′ Open table in a new tab E. coliKO229 (ispB::cat) harboring pKA3 (11Okada K.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3058-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with the plasmid containing mutant ispB, which produced transformants that were resistant to spectinomycin and ampicillin. The transformants were subcultured five times in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and plated on LB agar medium containing ampicillin. The resulting colonies were then replicated on LB medium containing ampicillin or spectinomycin. Spectinomycin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant strains, which had the mutant ispB plasmid, but not pKA3, were selected and used for ubiquinone analysis. To express the mutant ispB genes in S. cerevisiaeYKK6 (COQ1::URA3), aCOQ1-ispB fusion gene was constructed. The S2 and A3 primers were used to amplify the ispB gene by PCR. The fragment was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pSA1 (8Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys.

TheBamHI-HindIII fragment also was cloned into the yeast shuttle vector YEp13M4 (25Rose M.D. Broach J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 195-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). YKK6 was transformed with both plasmids by the lithium acetate method (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was selected on Synthetic Complete (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) glucose or 3% (w/v) glycerol, and the appropriate amino acids)−Leu−Ura medium. To overexpress and purify IspB, vectors containing the 6-His or glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag fused to IspB were constructed. The amplifiedBamHI-HindIII fragment containing ispBfrom pKO56 was cloned into pQE31 (QIAGEN Inc.) to yield pQKO56. The amplified BamHI-XhoI fragment containing wild-type or A79Y mutant ispB was cloned into pGEX-1X in which an XhoI linker had been inserted to yield pGKO56 or pG79Y, respectively. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli JM109. Transformants were grown to stationary phase in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 10 ml of culture was inoculated into 100 ml of the same medium. The culture was grown at 37 °C for 3 h, and recombinant protein expression was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min. To purify His-tagged IspB, cells were suspended in 50 mmsodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mmimidazole and sonicated 10 times for 10 s at 10-s intervals with an ultrasonic disintegrator in an ice bath. Ruptured cells were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were added to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) slurry and mixed gently at 4 °C for 60 min. This mixture was loaded onto a column and washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The His-IspB protein was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. To purify the GST-IspB protein, cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (sonication buffer). Cells were ruptured by sonication, and the lysate was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 60 min. This mixture was washed twice with 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 1.8 mm potassium phosphate and then with sonication buffer. The GST-IspB protein was eluted with sonication buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. TheEcoRI-HindIII fragment from pQKO56 was recloned into pSTVK28, which had been converted from expressing chloramphenicol resistance to kanamycin resistance, to yield pSTVKQKO56. KO229 cells harboring pBRA, which expresses IspB containing the mutation R321A, were transformed with pSTVKQKO56 and produced transformants that were resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin. Ampicillin-sensitive and kanamycin-resistant strains were selected following the method described above and transformed with pG79Y, and the strains harboring both plasmids were selected and named KO229/35-2. Ubiquinone extraction was performed by the method described previously (8Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys.

The crude extract of ubiquinone was analyzed by normal-phase TLC with authentic standard Q-10. Normal-phase TLC was carried out on a Kieselgel 60 F254 plate with benzene/acetone (97:3, v/v). The band containing ubiquinone was collected from the TLC plate following UV visualization and extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Samples were dried and redissolved in ethanol. The purified ubiquinone was further analyzed by HPLC with ethanol as the solvent. Prenyl-diphosphate synthase activity was measured by the method described previously (8Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in which incorporation of [1-14C]IPP into reaction products is detected. E. coli DH10B or KO229 cells, harboring plasmids containing mutantispB, were incubated to a late log phase in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; suspended in buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol); and ruptured by six sonication treatments, each lasting 30 s with 30-s intervals, in an ice bath. After centrifugation of the homogenate, the supernatant was used as a crude enzyme extract. The assay reaction mixture contained 1.0 mmMgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 10 μm[1-14C]IPP (specific activity of 0.92 TBq/mol), 5 μm FPP, and 200 μg of crude extract containing the enzyme in a final volume of 0.4 ml. Sample mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. Reaction products such as prenyl diphosphates were extracted with 1-butanol-saturated water and hydrolyzed with acid phosphatase (29Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The products of hydrolysis were extracted with hexane and analyzed by reversed-phase TLC with acetone/water (19:1, v/v). Radioactivity on the plate was detected with a BAS1500-Mac imaging analyzer (Fuji Film Co.). The plate was exposed to iodine vapor to detect the spots of the marker prenols. It is known that the side chain length of ubiquinone is determined by the corresponding polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase (8Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but it is not clear how polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase determines this length. To understand the nature of polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase, we analyzed the activity of octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (IspB), which produces the side chain of Q-8 in E. coli. For this purpose, we constructed 15 IspB mutants by site-directed mutagenesis as shown in Fig. 1 and TableII (primers that were used). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed following the method of Itoet al. (26Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and the substitutions in all mutantispB genes were confirmed by sequence analysis. E. coli DH10B was transformed with the plasmids containing mutant ispB genes, and the transformants were used in ubiquinone analysis. Because DH10B has the wild-type ispB gene in the form of genomic DNA, the main product is expected to be Q-8. Although most DH10B cells harboring the mutant ispB gene produced Q-8, a number of mutants produced Q-8 with small amounts of Q-6 and Q-7 (data not shown); and interestingly, DH10B harboring the A79Y mutant produced mainly Q-6 (see Fig. 6 A). To detect the actual ubiquinone species produced by the product of the mutant ispB gene, E. coliKO229 (ispB::cat)/pKA3 (ispB), which is defective for the genomic ispB gene, but retainsispB in a plasmid, was transformed with the plasmids containing the mutant ispB genes. KO229, which harbors the mutant ispB genes and has lost the wild-type ispBplasmid (pKA3), was selected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” L31V, I32V, Y38A, Y37A/Y38A, Y38A/R321V, Y61V, F75A, K235L, R321A, R321D, and R321V mutant KO229 strains were obtained; however, Y37A, A79Y, K170G, and K170A mutant KO229 strains could not be isolated. Since ispB is essential for growth of E. coli (11Okada K. Minehira M. Zhu X. Suzuki K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3058-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the inability to replace wild-type ispB with these mutants suggested that the Y37A, A79Y, K170G, and K170A mutants do not retain functional activity. The mutants that could complement the loss of the wild-type gene were further analyzed by ubiquinone extraction and analysis (Fig. 2). In the Y38A mutant, Q-7 was mainly produced, with lesser amounts of Q-6 and Q-8 (Fig. 2 D). In the Y37A/Y38A mutant, Q-7 and Q-6 were mainly produced, with a little Q-8 (Fig. 2 E). In the Y38A/R321V and R321V mutants, Q-6 was mainly produced, with a small amount of Q-5 and Q-7 (Fig. 2, F and L, respectively); however, hardly any Q-8 was produced. In the K235L and R321A mutants, Q-8 was mainly produced; however, a minor product (Q-7) was produced at a level that was greater than that with wild-type IspB (Fig. 2, I and J, respectively). These results indicate that Tyr-38, Lys-235, and Arg-321 are involved in chain length determination.Figure 2HPLC analysis of ubiquinone extracted from KO229 harboring various mutant ispB genes.Ubiquinone was extracted from E. coli KO229 harboring eachispB gene mutated as follows: A, wild-type (w. t.)

We took advantage of thisCOQ1 mutant phenotype for analysis of the function ofispB (8Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To express ispB mutants and to analyze their ubiquinone production in YKK6 (COQ1::URA3), mutant ispB genes fused with 53 amino acids of the Coq1 mitochondrial import signal were constructed. YKK6 was transformed with various mutant ispB fusion plasmids, and transformants were replicated on Synthetic Complete−Leu−Ura plates containing glucose (Fig. 3 A) or glycerol (Fig.3 B) as a non-fermentable carbon source. Although most of the strains grew on the glycerol plate, the Y37A, A79Y, K170G, and K170A mutant YKK6 strains did not grow, indicating that these mutants do not retain functional activity. These results are consistent with the complementation analysis of mutants in E. coli KO229/pKA3 (Fig. 2). We next analyzed the ubiquinone species produced by YKK6 harboring mutant ispB plasmids (Fig. 4). In the Y38A mutant, Q-8 was mainly produced, along with a significant amount of Q-7 (Fig. 4 C). In the Y37A/Y38A mutant, Q-8 and Q-7 were ma"

In this work we establish that the competitive binding of Bi3+ to the blood serum proteins albumin and transferrin, as isolated proteins and in blood plasma, can be monitored via observation of 1H and13C NMR resonances of isotopically labeled [ε-13C]Met transferrin. We show that Met132 in the I132M recombinant N-lobe transferrin mutant is a sensitive indicator of N-lobe metal binding. Bi3+binds to the specific Fe3+ sites of transferrin and the observed shifts of Met resonances suggest that Bi3+ induces similar conformational changes in the N-lobe of transferrin in aqueous solution and plasma. Bi3+ binding to albumin is nonspecific and Cys34 is not a major binding site, which is surprising because Bi3+ has a high affinity for thiolate sulfur. This illustrates that the potential target sites for metals (in this case Bi3+) in proteins depend not only on their presence but also on their accessibility.

Bi3+ binds to transferrin in preference to albumin both in aqueous solution and in blood plasma. human serum transferrin Bi(III) citrate human serum albumin heteronuclear single-quantum coherence recombinant N-lobe of hTF nitrilotriacetate pH meter reading in D2O ranitidine bismuth citrate (an amorphous solid containing ranitidine, bismuth, and citrate in an approximate 1:1:1 molar ratio) N,N-dimethyl-5-(3-nitromethylene-7-thia-2,4-diazaoctyl)furan-2-methanamine recombinant human albumin Bismuth compounds have long been associated with medicine for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders including diarrhea, constipation, gastritis, and ulcers (1Baxter G.F.

The effectiveness of bismuth has been attributed to its bactericidal action against the Gram-negative bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. There is also a growing interest in using compounds containing radioactive bismuth isotopes as targeted radiotherapeutic agents (5Kozak R.W. Waldmann T.A. Atcher R.W. Gansow O.A. Trends Biotech. 1986; 4: 259-264Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the mechanism of action of bismuth drugs is not well understood, including bismuth-induced toxicity, especially encephalopathy, which led to the withdrawal of bismuth drugs in France and Australia in the 1970s (1Baxter G.F. Pharm. J. 1989; 243: 805-810Google Scholar). The diagnosis of encephalopathy is generally defined by the detection of bismuth in blood, plasma or serum, the so-called “Hillemand safety level” (6Lambert J.R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 13: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Slikkerveer A. de Wolff F.A. Med. Toxicol. Adverse Drug Exp. 1989; 4: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Bismuth is primarily present in red blood cells, possibly binding to glutathione, with the remainder in serum or plasma (8Rao N. Feldman S. Pharm. Res. 1990; 7: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Rao N. Feldman S. Pharm. Res. 1990; 7: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Sadler P.J. Sun H. Li H. Chem. Eur. J. 1996; 2: 701-708Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The speciation of bismuth in blood plasma, and in particular the nature of interactions of Bi3+ with plasma proteins, are in need of investigation. Recently we have found that the binding of Bi3+ to human serum transferrin (hTF)1 and recombinant N-lobe of transferrin is unexpectedly strong (11Li H. Sadler P.J. Sun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9483-9489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Sun H. Li H. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Sadler P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 105-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transferrin is a single-chain glycoprotein (80 kDa) present in blood at a concentration of about 35 μm, and consists of two similar lobes, each of 40 kDa, connected by a short peptide. Its normal function in blood is to carry iron between sites of uptake, utilization, and storage (13Brock J.H. Harrison P.M. Metalloproteins: Part 2. Macmillan Press, Basingstoke, United Kingdom1985: 183-262Crossref Google Scholar, 14Harris D.C. Aisen P. Loehr T.M. Iron Carriers and Iron Proteins.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 69-83Google Scholar, 16Aisen P. Metal Ions Biol. Sys. 1998; 35: 585-631PubMed Google Scholar). It contains two specific iron-binding sites per molecule, one in the N-terminal lobe and one in the C-terminal lobe. Iron binds as Fe3+ in a cleft formed by two domains in each lobe. Iron cannot bind strongly without concomitant binding of a synergistic anion. Since transferrin is only about 30% saturated with iron in normal serum (13Brock J.H. Harrison P.M. Metalloproteins: Part 2. Macmillan Press, Basingstoke, United Kingdom1985: 183-262Crossref Google Scholar, 17Chasteen N.D. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1977; 22: 1-36Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Leibman A. Aisen P. Blood. 1979; 53: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is potential binding capacity for other metal ions that enter the blood. This has led to the idea that transferrin acts as a “delivery system” for therapeutic, diagnostic or toxic ions, including Ga3+, Ru3+, and Al3+ (19Welch M.J. Moerlein S. Martell A.E. Inorganic Chemistry in Biology and Medicine. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1980: 121-140Google Scholar, 20Kratz F. Hartmann M. Keppler B.K. Messori L. J. Biol.

Recently we have shown that Bi2-hTF can block both membrane binding and cellular uptake of 59Fe-hTF into BeWo placental cancer cells (22Guo M. Sun H. McArdle H.J. Gambling L. Sadler P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10023-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It is therefore now important to establish whether Bi3+ binding to transferrin can occur under physiologically relevant conditions, especially in the presence of excess albumin and in blood plasma itself. We have shown previously that the order of lobe loading of hTF with metal ions can readily be determined via two-dimensional 1H,13C NMR studies of recombinant [ε-13C]Met-hTF (23Sun H. Cox M.C. Li H. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Sadler P.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is known that the strength of binding to the two lobes is slightly different, and that Fe3+ is primarily situated in N-lobe in serum (14Harris D.C. Aisen P. Loehr T.M. Iron Carriers and Iron Proteins. VCH, Weinhein, Germany1989: 239-351Google Scholar,18Leibman A. Aisen P. Blood. 1979; 53: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous investigations of the interaction of Bi3+ with serum albumin has led to the suggestion that albumin may be the major target for Bi3+ in plasma (8Rao N. Feldman S. Pharm. Res. 1990; 7: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), especially since albumin has a free thiolate group at Cys34. Human serum albumin, the most abundant protein in blood at a concentration of about 40 mg ml−1 (about 0.63 mm, > 10 times that of transferrin), is a single-chain 66.5-kDa protein, which is largely α-helical, and consists of three structurally homologous domains (24Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar). It is the major transport protein for unesterified fatty acids, but is also capable of binding an extraordinarily diverse range of metabolites, drugs, organic compounds, and metal ions, e.g.Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ (25Peters Jr., T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar, 26Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). In the present work, the binding of a bismuth antiulcer drug to human serum transferrin in aqueous solution in the presence of a large excess of albumin and to recombinant transferrin (N-lobe of transferrin and the mutant I132M of N-lobe of transferrin labeled with [ε-13C]Met) in intact blood plasma has been monitored directly under physiologically relevant conditions using1H,13C NMR spectroscopy. The introduction of Met132 into the N-lobe provides a convenient monitor for metal binding since this residue occupies a similar site within helix 5 of the N-lobe and forms part of the hydrophobic patch around Trp128(Leu122-Trp128-Ile132) as Met464 in the C-lobe (Val454-Trp460-Met464). The interaction of bismuth with human albumin was also studied. Surprisingly, we found that Bi3+ still binds to the iron-binding sites of transferrin even in the presence of a large excess of albumin. Recombinant N-lobe hTF/2N (residues 1–337) was expressed in baby hamster kidney cells using a pNUT plasmid withl-[ε-13C]methionine in the growth medium, and purified as described previously (27Mason A.B. Funk W.D. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Protein Exp. Purif. 1991; 2: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Mason A.B. Miller M.K. Funk W.D. Banfield D.K. Savage K.J. Oliver R.W.A. Green B.N. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A gene for the mutant I132M protein was created by site-directed mutagenesis using previously published methods (27Mason A.B. Funk W.D. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Protein Exp. Purif. 1991; 2: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 189: 147-151Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Iron was removed from proteins by treatment with a metal-removal buffer containing 1 mm NTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 4.9, using ultrafiltration Centricon 10 ultrafilters (Amicon). Human serum albumin (HSA) was purchased from Sigma as essentially globulin-free and fatty acid-free and was purified via ultrafiltration (Centricon 10) using 0.1 m KCl and washing 3 times (each 1 h). It was then lyophilized. Recombinant human albumin (rHA) was supplied by Delta Biotechnology Ltd. (batches GA 950202 and R970103). Samples of rHA were dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9, and freeze-dried. Ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) and bismuth citrate [Bi(Hcit)] were provided by GlaxoWellcome plc. NaHCO3, KCl, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and other chemicals were purchased either from Aldrich or Sigma with the highest quality and used as received. Crystalline [Bi(NTA)] was synthesized according to a literature procedure (30Summers S.P. Abboud K.A. Farrah S.R. Palenik G.J. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 88-92Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and had a satisfactory elemental analysis. A 50 mm stock solution of [Bi(cit)]− was prepared by addition the minimum amount of ammonia solution to a suspension of [Bi(Hcit)] until the solution became clear. The final pH of this solution was about 7, and it was then diluted before use. A solution of Fe(NTA)2 was prepared from an iron atomic absorption standard (1000 ppm in 1% HNO3, Aldrich) and 2 mol eq of H3NTA (Aldrich), followed by pH adjustment to between 6.0 and 7.0. This was lyophilized and redissolved in D2O before use. A [Bi(NTA)] solution was prepared by dissolving a known amount of [Bi(NTA)] in D2O. I132M [ε-13C]Met hTF/2N (0.15 mm) and mixtures with either rHA (1.8 mm) or HSA (1.8 mm) were prepared in D2O containing 0.1 m KCl. Prior to Bi3+ or Fe3+ titrations, an aliquot of concentrated NaHCO3 (0.25 m) was added to the samples to give a final concentration of 10 mm, and pH* values were adjusted using NaOD or DCl. For the intact blood plasma experiments, blood from a male healthy volunteer was collected by venipuncture into lithium-heparinized vacutainers, and the plasma was separated by centrifugation at 6000 rmp for 20 min at 277 K, and stored frozen until used for NMR measurements. I132M hTF/2N was added to 1.2 ml of intact blood plasma to give a hTF/2N concentration of 50 μm and the concentration of this sample was doubled by freeze-drying and reconstitution in 0.6 ml of D2O, followed by addition of concentrated NaHCO3 to a final concentration of 20 mm. The pH* was then measured. After addition of Bi3+, samples were left to equilibrate for at least 30 min at 310 K. All experiments on reconstituted blood plasma were carried out at pH* 7.8 since it was possible to maintain this as a stable pH* value during the course of the long NMR data accumulations. If the initial pH* value was lower, it tended to drift upwards during the experiment. The 1H,13C chemical shifts of the [ε-13C]Met resonances of transferrin were insensitive to pH over the range of 7–8.8, and NMR experiments on Bi3+loading of transferrin with [Bi(NTA)] and ranitidine bismuth citrate gave the same results at pH* 7.4 and pH* 7.8. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX500 spectrometer at 310 K. For one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra, 400 to 1200 transients were acquired with 6-μs (50o) pulses and 16,384 data points during the 2-s pulse delay and the water resonance was suppressed via presaturation. For two-dimensional 1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra (HSQC) experiments, the sequence was optimized for 1J (1H-13C) = 140 Hz, and 16 to 32 transients were acquired using 2,048 data points in the f2 dimension (1H), 32 to 64 increments in the f1 dimension, 13C frequency width of 3 kHz, and relaxation delay of 1.6 s. The 13C spins were decoupled using the GARP sequence (31Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). After zero-filling to 4,096 × 1,024 data points, unshifted Gaussian functions were used for processing in both dimensions. Water suppression was achieved by a combination of presaturation and pulsed-field gradients. One-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra (or 13C-edited1H NMR spectra) were recorded using the first increment of the two-dimensional HSQC sequence. Resolution enhancement was achieved using a combination of exponential (1.5 to 10 Hz line-broadening) and unshifted sine-bell functions (32Sadler P.J. Tucker A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Peaks were referenced to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4via the external ε-CH3 peak of l-methionine (15.14 ppm) for 13C and via formate (8.465 ppm, a minor impurity always present in the protein) for 1H. HSA (concentration about 0.1 mm) was incubated with different mole ratios of RBC in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 310 K. Unbound RBC was separated via gel filtration using a Superose 12 column and a FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The concentration of albumin samples was about 6 mg/ml and 500 μl of the protein solution was loaded onto the column. Elution conditions were 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and flow rate 0.5 ml/min. The fractions eluting from 10 to 14 ml were collected and the bismuth content was determined using a CETAC Microneb 2000 direct injection nebulizer (CETAC Technologies, Omaha, NE) coupled with a VG PlasmaQuad PQ2 ICP-MS instrument (VG Elemental, Winsford, Cheshire, UK). Details of the optimization procedure for the DIN-ICP-MS system and measurement conditions for bismuth have been described previously (33Li H. Keohane B.M. Sun H. Sadler P.J. J. Anal. At. Spectrom. 1997; 12: 1111-1114Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The free SH content of albumin was determined after incubation with RBC or [Bi(cit)]− using Ellman's reagent, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). HSA or rHA were incubated with different mole ratios of RBC or [Bi(cit)]− overnight (>12 h) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, 310 K, pH 7.4, and unbound bismuth was removed by ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 ultrafilters. The concentrations of HSA and rHA were determined using ε279 values of 35,300 and 37,100m−1 cm−1, respectively (25Peters Jr., T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar, 34Janatova J. Fuller J.K. Hunter M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3612-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the amount of nitrobenzoic acid thiol generated was calculated using ε412 = 13,600 m−1cm−1 (35Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that 1H NMR spectra of human serum transferrin are complicated by the overlap of the very large number of resonances present and by their broadening due to the slow tumbling of this 80-kDa protein (36Kubal G. Sadler P.J. Evans R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1117-1118Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the high-field region of the spectrum of the N-lobe is relatively well resolved. High field-shifted resonances have been assigned to protons from residues around Trp128, i.e. Leu122, and Ile132 (37Kubal G. Mason A.B. Sadler P.J. Tucker A. Woodworth R.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Beatty E.J. Cox M.C. Frenkiel T.A. He Q.-Y. Mason A.B. Sadler P.J. Tucker A. Woodworth R.C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The mutation of Ile132 to Met should lead to the disappearance of the resonance at −0.603 ppm, which has been previously assigned as γCH2 of Ile132. Indeed, this was found to be the case (Fig.1). Other changes were also observed in the spectrum of the mutant in comparison to that of wild-type hTF/2N. For example, the resonance at −0.170 ppm for hTF/2N disappeared, and the peak for δCH3 of Leu122 (−0.339 ppm in hTF/2N) shifted to −0.324 ppm. Addition of 0.5 mol eq of Bi3+ (as [Bi(NTA)]) caused new peaks to appear at −0.160 ppm (C′), and −0.255 ppm (B′), and further addition of Bi3+ (total 1.0 mol eq) increased the intensity of both C′ and B′ but decreased that of peak B significantly (Fig.1 A). For comparison, titrations of Fe3+ (added as Fe(NTA)2) with the mutant protein were also performed under similar conditions (pH* 7.8, 310 K and 10 mm bicarbonate) and the results are shown in Fig. 1 B. Upon addition of 0.5 mol eq of Fe3+, the resonance at −0.324 ppm decreased in intensity, and almost completely disappeared with 0.9 mol eq Fe3+ present. Broad new peaks at −0.004 and −0.392 ppm appeared and increased in intensity. It is reasonable to assume from these titration studies that the resonance at −0.324 ppm consists of two overlapped peaks, one of which (peak B) can be assigned to the δCH3 of Leu122 as judged from the change in pattern of this peak on titration of both wild-type and mutant proteins with metal ions. The other peak (C) cannot be assigned. Two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY experiments support these assignments (data not shown). Peak B has identical associated NOESY cross-peaks for both wild-type and mutant hTF/2N, which suggests that peak B belongs to the δCH3 of Leu122. Similar cross-peak patterns were observed for B and B′ in the NOESY spectrum, which indicates that peak B′ for the metal-bound protein is the analogue of peak B. A comparison of the changes in the chemical shifts of the δCH3 peak of Leu122 after binding of hTF/2N and I132M-hTF/2N to Bi3+ and Fe3+ is shown in Fig. 1 C. The two-dimensional 1H,13C HSQC NMR spectrum of I132M hTF/2N and after addition of 0.5 mol eq of Bi3+ or Fe3+, in the presence of 10 mm bicarbonate, are compared in Fig. 2. As expected, six cross-peaks were observed for the apo-protein, five of which have similar chemical shifts as those observed for the wild-type protein. These have been assigned previously on the basis of single-site mutations combined with other considerations (39Beatty E.J. Cox M.C. Frenkiel T.A. Tam B.M. Mason A.B. MacGillivray R.T.A. Sadler P.J. Woodworth R.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7635-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40He Q.-Y. Mason A.B. Tam B.M. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 881-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the sixth peak, at 1.51/17.98 ppm, can be assigned to Met132. On addition of 0.5 mol eq of Bi3+ (added as either RBC or as [Bi(NTA)]), a notable decrease in intensity of the latter peak occurred and a new peak appeared at 1.45/17.93 ppm, which can be associated with the bound form of the protein. Other new peaks, which can be assigned to Met109 and Met309, also appeared and shifted slightly in both 1H and13C dimensions (Table I). Further addition of Bi3+ (1.0 mol eq) caused the disappearance of the peaks at 1.51/17.98, 1.94/16.15, and 2.15/16.16 ppm and led to a further increase in the intensity of the new peaks. These changes were observed more clearly in high-resolution one-dimensional 13C-edited1H spectra (see below, Fig. 3).Table I1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of the [ɛ-13C]Met resonances of apo-I132M hTf/2N (in 10 mm HCO3−) and its Bi3+ complex at 310 KResidueApo-form δ/ppm, δ (1H/13C)Bi-boundδ (1H/13C)Δδ (1H/13C)Met261.97 /14.651.97 /14.600.00 /−0.05Met1091.94 /16.151.97 /16.220.03 /0.07Met1321.51 /17.981.45 /17.93−0.06 /−0.05Met2562.13 /15.542.13 /15.540.00 /0.00Met3092.15 /16.162.14 /16.10−0.01 /−0.06Met3132.21 /15.762.20 /15.75−0.01 /−0.01 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Effect of the antiulcer compound ranitidine bismuth citrate on the one-dimensional 13C-edited1H NMR spectrum of apo-I132M hTF/2N.

The resonance for Met132 in the apo-protein disappeared after addition of 1.0 mol eq of Fe3+. The changes to the shifts of the other Met resonances were identical to those observed on addition of 1.0 mol eq of Bi3+. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift changes induced by metal ions (e.g.Fe3+ and Bi3+) provide convenient probes for investigation of Bi3+ translocation between transferrin and proteins such as albumin. These experiments were performed using low concentrations of I132M hTF/2N (150 μm) in the presence of 12 mol eq of HSA or rHA (1.8 mm), pH* 7.8, 10 mm bicarbonate, 310 K. We choose an [albumin]/[transferrin] ratio of 12:1 to mimic biological conditions. The concentration of albumin in blood plasma (about 0.63 mm) is about 18 times higher than that of transferrin (about 35 μm), but hTF is only about 30% saturated with Fe3+. The 1H,13C two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectrum of this protein mixture shows sharp resonances from the six labeled Met residues of transferrin and broadened (natural abundance) resonances from albumin. The Met132 peak was overlapped with peaks from albumin (data not shown). Since I132M hTF/2N is present at low concentration, one-dimensional 13C-edited1H NMR spectra were recorded over a period of 30 min each. Fig. 3 shows the 13C-edited 1H NMR spectrum of I132M hTF/2N in the absence and presence of recombinant albumin (rHA). Broad resonances at 1.70 and from 1.45 to 1.10 ppm from albumin were filtered out with resolution enhancement using a combination of unshifted sine-bell and exponential functions prior to Fourier transformation. The antiulcer compound, ranitidine bismuth citrate, was added in 0.25 mol eq steps to I132M hTF/2N in the presence of 12 mol eq of rHA, 10 mm bicarbonate. With increase in Bi3+concentration, a new peak at 1.45 ppm appeared. This can be assigned to Met132 in Bi-I132M hTF/2N, and it gradually increased in intensity, reaching a maximum after 1 mol eq of Bi3+ had been added. The peak for Met132 in the apo-protein simultaneously decreased in intensity and finally disappeared (Fig. 3). The change in the peak for Met309 (2.15 ppm) was observable more clearly in one-dimensional 1H{13C} spectra: it gradually decreased in intensity with the addition of Bi3+ and finally disappeared. The resonance for Met309 is probably that at 2.14 ppm, which was overlapped with Met256, as can be judged from the increased intensity in the two-dimensional HSQC spectrum (data not shown). The peak for Met109 also appears to shift to low field by 0.03 ppm. The same chemical shift changes were observed after addition of Bi3+ to I132M hTF/2N in the presence of 12 mol eq of HSA. The lack of effect of albumin on Bi3+ binding to this transferrin N-lobe is clearly illustrated in Fig. 3 C, which shows the integrated intensity of the peak for Met132 after addition of various amounts of Bi3+ in the absence and presence of albumin. Since the concentration of albumin present in the sample is much higher than that of transferrin, the 1H NMR spectrum is dominated by peaks from albumin. The aromatic region of spectra of these mixed protein solutions (hTF/2N + 12rHA or + 12HSA) was almost identical with and without addition of Bi3+, particularly the resonance at 7.632 ppm, which has been previously assigned (41Christodoulou J.

It is only about 30% saturated with iron (18Leibman A. Aisen P. Blood. 1979; 53: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore has about 50 μm capacity for binding to other metal ions. To determine if transferrin is a target for bismuth, isotopically labeled [ε-13C]Met I132M hTF/2N (50 μm) was directly added to human plasma. The whole plasma concentration (including the added transferrin) was lyophilized, and the sample was redissolved in half-volume of the original plasma solution. This gave an I132M hTF/2N concentration of 100 μm. Even with resolution enhancement, the peak for Met132 was still overlapped with other peaks in the 13C-edited1H NMR spectrum (data not shown). Therefore only the two-dimensional HSQC method was used. The two-dimensional HSQC spectrum of this solution containing 100 mm KCl and 20 mm bicarbonate is shown in Fig.4. Surprisingly, the peak for Met109 became severely broadened but the rest of the Met cross-peaks from transferrin were clearly observed. Many other cross-peaks are present but are difficult to assign, partly due to the limited frequency width used (12 ppm in 13C dimension). The peaks at about 1.46/17.2 ppm, and 1.67/15.8 ppm (folded in13C dimension) can be assigned to Ala and Lys residues, respectively, of albumin, and the peaks at about 1.24/19.2 ppm to lipids in plasma. After addition of 0.5 mol eq of RBC (relative to the available transferrin-binding sites), the peak for Met132(1.51/17.98 ppm) in apo-hTF/2N decreased in intensity and the peak at 1.45/17.93 ppm for Bi3+-I132M hTF/2N increased in intensity. Similarly, the peak for Met109 (1.94/16.15 ppm) disappeared and a new peak (bound form) appeared at slightly lower field, and that for Met309 (2.15/16.16 ppm) shifted to high field. The cross-peak for Met132 in the apo-protein almost disappeared and the analogous peak for the bound-form further increased in intensity (Fig. 4). After addition of 1.0 mol eq of RBC, this behavior was similar to that observed for I132M hTF/2N with and without 12 mol eq of serum albumin or recombinant albumin under same conditions. Interestingly, with Bi3+ bound to the protein, the peak for Met26 became sharper and observable. A second experiment was carried out with blood plasma containing twice the concentration of I132M (200 μm), but the behavior of the Met two-dimensional cross-peaks on titration with RBC was similar.

Tel-2 is the second mammalian member of the Tel Ets family subclass whose prototype Tel is involved in various chromosomal translocations in human cancers. Six differentially expressed alternative splice products of Tel-2 were characterized encoding different Tel-2 isoforms which either contain or lack the amino-terminal Pointed domain and also vary at the carboxyl terminus. In contrast to Tel, which is highly expressed in several different cell types and tissues, Tel-2 is only weakly expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, including placenta, prostate, spleen, liver, and lung. Tel-2 binds to functionally relevant Ets-binding sites of several genes and only the Tel-2 isoform containing the Pointed domain and the DNA-binding domain acts as a strong repressor of transcription. The retinoic acid receptor α and bone morphogenetic protein-6B(BMP-6) genes are specifically repressed by Tel-2 indicating a function for Tel-2 as an inhibitor of differentiation. Due to the important involvement of Tel in human cancer and the location of Tel-2 within the MHC cluster region,Tel-2 might be involved in chromosomal translocations in human cancer as well.AF116509AF116510AF218235AF218365AF218366 We report here the isolation ofTel-2, a novel member of the Ets transcription factor family, with high homology to Tel/ETV-6.

Various members of the Ets transcription factor family have been shown to cause cellular transformation, when aberrantly expressed.

Tel is the prototype and sole member of a distinct subclass of Ets factors with the closest homologue being the Drosophila Ets factor Yan. A recent deposition of the full-length sequence of a human genomic DNA PAC clone derived from chromosome 6p21.3 within the MHC cluster region indicated the potential existence of a novel Tel-related Ets factor. We now report the cloning and characterization of full-length cDNAs for this new member of the Tel subclass of Ets factors, Tel-2, which is present in at least six alternative splice forms. Human foreskin keratinocytes, CV-1 (green monkey kidney), LNCaP (human prostate), HEK293 (human fetal epithelial kidney), C-33A (human cervical carcinoma), A431 (human vulvar carcinoma), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), H157 (human large cell lung carcinoma), H249 (human small cell lung carcinoma), HUVEC (human endothelial), U-87 Mg, and U-138 Mg (human glioma cells), U-937 (human monocytes), MG-63 (human osteosarcoma), human synovial fibroblasts, and human chondrocytes were grown as described (31Libermann T.A.

To search for novel members of the Ets family human public DNA data bases were searched for sequences homologous to known Ets members as described (32Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J.

The human DNA sequence from PAC 50J22 on chromosome 6p21.3 contained sequences predicting homology to the Ets-related protein Tel. These sequence homologies were spread over several putative exons indicating that it does not encode a pseudogene. PCR1 primers across two exons spanning the Ets domain were synthesized and used to determine whether we could detect any transcripts for this Ets related factor in different tissues. RT-PCR using mRNA derived from human pancreas and prostate as described (34Oettgen P. Kas K. Dube A. Gu X. Grall F. Thamrongsak U. Akbarali Y. Finger E. Boltax J. Endress G. Munger K. Kunsch C.

Sequence analysis confirmed that this fragment encoded the new Tel-related cDNA Tel-2. The 229-bp cDNA amplified from human prostate RNA contained an open reading frame throughout this clone suggesting that part of the 5′ and 3′ end were missing. To determine the 5′ and 3′ end of Tel-2 we performed the RACE method using human adult prostate cDNA ready for 5′-RACE (CLONTECH) and nested primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the partial Tel-2 cDNA as described (35Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA fragments were subcloned and sequenced as described (35Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The sequences of the Tel-2 cDNAs were confirmed by repeating amplification using primers specific for both ends of the longest RACE products obtained in the first two rounds of PCR amplification. The 5′ and 3′ end sequences of the Tel-2cDNAs were confirmed by repeating 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR amplification using primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the longest RACE products obtained in the first two rounds of PCR amplification. Six alternative splice variants of Tel-2 were isolated and confirmed by full-length cloning and sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were determined at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center DNA sequencing facility using an Applied Biosystems Prism Automatic DNA Sequencer Model 377 using the Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis utilized DNA Strider, Lasergene (DNASTAR) and BLAST, BEAUTY, and Clustal W searches (NCBI). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. cDNAs were generated from 1 μg of mRNA isolated from different cells or tissues using oligo(dT)12–18 priming (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Moloney murine leukemia reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in deoxyribonuclease I (Life Technologies, Inc.)-treated samples. cDNAs derived from different fetal and adult human tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. Each PCR reaction used equivalent amounts of 0.1 ng of cDNA, 4 ng/μl of each primer, 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 150 μm of each dNTP, 3 mm of MgCl2, reaction buffer, and water to a final volume of 25 μl and were covered with mineral oil. The sequences of the ubiquitousTel-2 specific primers were: sense, 5′-CCTACGAGAAGATGTCTCGTG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCAGGTGGCTGTGCTTGTCC-3′ with an expected amplification product of 134 bp. The sequences of theTel-2 specific primers for the 3′ exon 8 were: sense, 5′-ACGTGTATCAGCTGCTCCTTG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCAGGTGGCTGTGCTTGTCC-3′ and crossed two introns between exons 6 and 8 with an expected amplification product of 273 bp. The sequences of theTel-2e/Tel-2f specific primers were: sense, 5′-GTCACTGTGCAGAGCTCGGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CAGGAAGTGTGGGTCCTCCAA-3′ and crossed three introns between exons 5 and 9 with an expected amplification product of 438 bp. The sequences of theTel-2 5′ end specific primers were: sense, 5′-GCGCTCAAGACAGAAAGCCGG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CTGGAGCAGCTCATACAGGAC-3′ and crossed three introns between exons 1 and 4 with expected amplification products of 418 bp for Tel-2a, 377 bp forTel-2b, 241 bp for Tel-2c, and 212 bp forTel-2d. The sequences of the primers for GAPDH were: sense, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′ with an expected amplification product of 200 bp. The sequences of the primers for retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) were: sense, 5′-GTCCGACAAGGTCATCCTGT-3′ and antisense, 5′-GTGTCACCGGGACAAGAACT-3′ with an expected amplification product of 360 bp. The sequences of the primers for BMP-6 were: sense, 5′-CTCGGGGTTCATAAGGTGAA-3′ and antisense, 5′-ACAGCATAACATGGGGCTTC-3′ with an expected amplification product of 412 bp. RT-PCR amplifications were carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler 480 as follows: 20–35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C followed by 10 min at 72 °C. 10 μl of the amplification product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The full-length Tel-2 cDNAs were inserted into the EcoRI site of the pCI (Promega) eukaryotic expression vector downstream of the T7 and cytomegalovirus promoters. Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Tel-2 isoforms were generated as follows. A 111-bp trimer of HA tags was inserted into theXhoI and NotI sites of the pCI vector as a COOH-terminal epitope generating pCI/HA. Full-length Tel-2a, Tel-2b, and Tel-2c cDNAs with flankingSalI sites were amplified from pCI/Tel-2a, pCI/Tel-2b, and pCI/Tel-2c using a common pair of primers: 5′-TCATGTCGACTCCTCACCTCCACCTGTA-3′ and 5′-ATCTAGTCGACCGGAGAGATTTCTGGCCT-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into the SalI site of pCI/HA in-frame with the COOH-terminal HA epitope tag. Synthetic wild type E74 Ets site oligonucleotides containingSalI and XhoI ends were inserted into theSalI site of the Δ56-c-fos-pGL3 plasmid as described (32Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J.

Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Co-transfections of 3 × 105 CV-1 cells were carried out with 3.5 μg of E74/Δ56-pGL3, lyn/pGL3 or IgH/Δ56-pGL3 reporter gene construct DNA and 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 μg of Tel-2 expression vector DNA using 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (32Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cells were assayed 16 h after transfection. Transfections for every construct were performed independently in duplicates and repeated 3 to 4 times with two different plasmid preparations with similar results. Equal amounts of cell extract protein were used to normalize the luciferase assay. Co-transfection of a second plasmid for determination of transfection efficiency was omitted because potential artifacts with this technique have been reported (36Farr A. Roman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and because many commonly used viral promoters contain potential binding sites for Ets factors. To compare relative expression levels of Tel-2 isoforms after transfection 3 μg of pCI/HA Tel-2a, Tel-2b, and Tel-2c expression vectors were transfected into COS cells using 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE. Whole cell extracts were generated 16 h later using a lysis buffer containing 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation reactions with the different untagged and HA-tagged Tel-2 splice variants inserted downstream of the T7 promoter into the pCI vector were performed in TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerKinElmer Life Sciences) as described (37Lopez M.

Poly(A)+ mRNAs were isolated as described by Libermann et al. (31Libermann T.A. Friesel R. Jaye M. Lyall R.M. Westermark B. Drohan W. Schmidt A. Maciag T. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated using guanidine isothiocyanate nucleic acid extraction and cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation (38Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Northern blots and dot blots containing poly(A)+-selected mRNA derived from different human tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized with random prime-labeled Tel-2b full-length cDNA in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) as described (32Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and washed at 50 °C with 0.2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS. 106 human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were transiently transfected in duplicates with 8 μg of pCI/Tel-2b or pCI plasmid using 30 μl of Superfect (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated separately from each plate 18 and 20 h after transfection using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three types of Atlas human cDNA microarray nylon membranes fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA), each containing 1136 different genes membrane, were hybridized with [32P]dATP-labeled cDNAs derived from 4 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer at 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) using a Model 2000 Micro Hybridization Incubator (Robbins Scientific). The filters were washed according to the user's instruction and exposed to Bio-Max MS film (Fisher) for different exposure times. Hybridizations were performed with duplicate experiments. The spot intensities reflecting gene expression levels on the Atlas human cDNA array were quantified using the Atlas Image 1.5 Software (CLONTECH). The Tel-2b gene expression profiles were compared with the gene expression profile with the parental pCI vector normalizing spot intensities based on the average of the intensities of all spots. Genes up-regulated or down-regulated by Tel-2b were validated by RT-PCR. To search for novel members of the Ets family the GenBankTM data base was searched for sequences homologous to the Ets domain. A human genomic DNA sequence from PAC 50J22 (Z84484) on chromosome 6p21.3 contained sequences related to the Ets factor Tel and was used for further analysis. Since the Tel-related sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain were spread over several putative exons separated by apparent introns, we assumed that this Ets-related gene does not encode a pseudogene. To test whether this putative Ets-related gene is indeed transcribed into mRNA, we designed PCR primers spanning several putative exons and performed RT-PCR using mRNA from various human tissues as well as human genomic DNA. Genomic DNA gave the expected amplification product. Human pancreas and prostate-derived cDNA resulted in a smaller amplification product which upon sequencing confirmed the existence of a correctly spliced mRNA expressed in those tissues. We describe here the isolation and characterization of full-length cDNA clones for this new member of the Ets family, the second member of the Tel subclass, which we have namedTel-2. To clone the full-length cDNA encodingTel-2 we performed the 5′ and 3′ RACE method as described (35Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) using RACE ready human prostate Marathon cDNA. Both strands of the full-length Tel-2 cDNAs were sequenced entirely by double-stranded dideoxy sequencing using T7 and T3 polymerase sequencing primers, and Tel-2-specific primers based on partial DNA sequencing (Fig. 1). Four alternative splice products of Tel-2, Tel-2a, Tel-2b, Tel-2c, and Tel-2d, which differed in their coding regions, were identified. The 5′ end sequences of the Tel-2cDNAs were confirmed by repeating 5′-RACE PCR amplification using primers specific for the 5′ end of the longest 5′-RACE products obtained in the first two rounds of PCR amplification. The 3′ end of these four Tel-2 splice variants contains a long poly(A) tract which is preceded by a classical polyadenylation site (Fig. 1) at an appropriate distance. All four Tel-2 splice products contain the same 3′ and 5′ ends and are alternative splice forms as was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of full-length cDNAs encoding all four splice products. The length of the Tel-2afull-length cDNA is 1592 bp, of Tel-2b 1551 bp, ofTel-2c 1415 bp, and that of Tel-2d is 1385 bp (Fig. 1). Inspection of the public EST data base identified four ESTs encoding an apparent fifth alternative splice product (Tel-2e and Tel-2f) that diverges at the 3′ end of the cDNA in comparison to the other four Tel-2 splice variants and contains alternative polyadenylation sequences. To clone this putative fifth splice product we used Tel-2e/f-specific primers at the 3′ end of Tel-2e/f and primers from the 5′ end of Tel-2 and performed RT-PCR using the human prostate Marathon cDNA. Two divergent full-length amplification products of the expected sizes containing the 5′ ends of Tel-2b andTel-2d, respectively, were obtained and fully sequenced confirming the existence of a Tel-2e and Tel-2fsplice product (Fig. 1 c). Interestingly, the 3′ end ofTel-2e and Tel-2f contains three apparent polyadenylation sites and an L1 LINE rep"

Although convection is thermally driven in the unstable interior, the resulting convective motions concentrate primarily in the stable outer region. This phenomenon, which we term teleconvection, suggests that fluid motions observed at the ""surface"" of a planet (such as Jupiter's alternating zonal winds) may be driven by an energy source located deep inside the planet."

Platelet activation by collagen is a two-stage process involving sites in collagen, which support platelet adhesion, and others, which support both platelet adhesion and activation (5Morton L.F.

This study was designed to clarify which collagen receptors transmit signals to the platelet interior, information which is crucial for the development of anti-platelet therapy based on collagen receptor antagonism (9Clemetson K.J.

CRP comprises a repeating GPO motif, a sequence representing about 10% of the primary structure of collagen.

This peptide, GPC-[GPP]5-GFOGER-[GPP]5-GPC, designated GFOGER-GPP, supports platelet adhesion, as well as collagen, but does not activate platelets in suspension even when cross-linked (GFOGER-GPP-XL), nor does it stimulate obvious tyrosine phosphorylation (23Knight C.G.

Phosphorylation of FAK occurs at five tyrosine residues and correlates with an increase in FAK tyrosine kinase activity. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine 397 allows it to bind the c-Src family member Fyn (37Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another possible regulatory mechanism for FAK is proteolytic cleavage by the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain, which leads to a reduction in its autophosphorylation (41Cooray P. Yuan Y.

FAK phosphorylation in platelets has been dissociated from both αIIbβ3 occupancy and focal adhesion formation centering on αIIbβ3 in the absence of fibrinogen binding (49Lyman S. Gilmore A.

We considered that FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets might be an early event after occupancy of α2β1 by collagen fibers, and that we could determine the relative importance of α2β1 and GpVI in this process by comparing the capacity of collagen, CRP-XL, and GFOGER-GPP-XL to elicit FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Synthetic triple-helical peptides have not hitherto been examined in this context. We have applied these ligands to human platelets, immunoprecipitated FAK with specific anti-FAK antibodies, and determined the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the enzyme as an index of its activity. Furthermore, we have examined the role of intracellular Ca2+ and PKC in platelet FAK activation using the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, to increase the internal platelet Ca2+ concentration and the Ca2+chelator, BAPTA, to buffer platelet cytosolic Ca2+; PKC was either directly activated using the phorbol ester, TPA, or specifically inhibited using Ro31-8220.

Platelet concentrates, less than 24 h-old, pooled from four donors, were obtained from the National Blood Service, Long Road, Cambridge, UK, centrifuged at 250 ×g for 15 min to remove red blood cells, leaving platelet-rich plasma, from which the platelets were centrifuged at 700 × g for 15 min. The platelet pellet was resuspended in loading buffer (LB; 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.36). The platelets were pelleted at 700 × g for 10 min and resuspended in LB at 109/ml for immunoprecipitation and at 5 × 108/ml for other work. Aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (0.25 units/ml) were used where indicated. Platelet-agonist suspensions (500 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × radioimmune precipitation buffer (2% Triton X-100, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS (each w/v), 316 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.2, with 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Na3VO4), and incubated on ice for 30 min before centrifugation (13,000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C.

It was then centrifuged again and resuspended in 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer containing bovine serum albumin (1% w/v). Samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g) for 1 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed, and to it anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) was added at 1 μg per ml of platelet lysate, and the sample was rotated for 20 h at 4 °C. Pansorbin (60 μl) was then added to each sample, and the samples were mixed and rotated at 4 °C for 60 min before being centrifuged (13,000 ×g) for 1 min at 4 °C.

One blot was incubated with 4G10 (1:2500) and washed with TBST (20 mmTris/HCl, 136 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6), and anti-phosphotyrosine was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000) and enhanced chemiluminescence (1.24 mm luminol, 1.63 mm 4-iodophenol, 2.71 mm H2O2). Phosphorylation was quantitated densitometrically using a Leica Q500 image analyzer (51Hargreaves P.G. Licking E.F. Sargeant P. Sage S.O. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is expressed as a percentage change relative to control values. The other blot was probed with monoclonal anti-FAK (Affiniti, 1:1000), to verify uniform recovery of FAK. Each experiment was performed using a different platelet preparation on three separate occasions. Platelets were prepared as for immunoprecipitation and resuspended to 109/ml in LB. 150 μl of suspension was stirred (1100 rpm) in an aggregometer at 30 °C as described (19Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

To verify the inhibitory properties of the anti-β1antibody, 2A4, washed platelets were prepared from whole blood (19Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

Platelets were prepared as for immunoprecipitation and resuspended to 109/ml in LB. They were labeled with 32Pi at 100 μCi/ml for 1 h at 30 °C, centrifuged to remove excess radiolabel, and resuspended to 109/ml. Samples (20 μl) were treated with ligand (5 μl), and the reaction was stopped after 2 min using 25 μl of Laemmli buffer (51Hargreaves P.G. Licking E.F. Sargeant P. Sage S.O. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W.

Proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and the phosphorylation of a 47-kDa protein band (p47, presumed to be pleckstrin, the major protein kinase C substrate in platelets (52Tyers M.

Platelet concentrates were centrifuged to remove red cells as above and loaded with 2 μm Fura2-AM at room temperature for 45 min. Platelets were pelleted by centrifugation as above and resuspended to 108/ml in LB. The platelet suspensions were transferred to a Spex Fluoromax DM3000CM fluorimeter, and fluorescence excited at 340 and 380 nm was used to calculate the intracellular calcium concentration as described previously (53Sage S.O. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: A Practical Approach. IRL at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 67-90Google Scholar). Where indicated, BAPTA-AM (20 μm) was preincubated after Fura2 loading for 20 min. FAK, immunoprecipitated from platelets activated by collagen at 25 μg/ml, showed a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.1 a). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation at 60 s was detectable but small; therefore, 5-min incubation, causing a substantial increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, was chosen for subsequent assays. Fig. 1 b shows equal recovery of FAK in each sample. Immunoprecipitation of FAK from platelets activated by CRP-XL at 5 μg/ml showed a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 1 c). Fig. 1 d shows immunoprecipitated FAK from CRP-XL-activated platelets, using the Affiniti monoclonal anti-FAK for immunodetection. Again, equal amounts of FAK were demonstrated in each sample. Fig.2, a and d, shows a concentration-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK immunoprecipitated from platelets activated by different concentrations of collagen and CRP-XL. Equal recovery of FAK was demonstrated in all cases (data not shown). Collagen fibers at 25 μg/ml and CRP-XL at 5 μg/ml caused near-maximal increases in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Some experiments (data not shown) were performed in the presence of apyrase, which scavenges ADP secreted by activated platelets, and aspirin, which blocks the conversion of arachidonate to thromboxane A2. The inhibitors had no marked effect, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK does not depend upon these processes in platelets stimulated by collagen or CRP-XL. In some experiments the basal level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable, whereas others (e.g. Fig. 2 e) showed negligible FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. This may reflect variation between donors, or in the activation state of resting platelets between experiments, as well as in the immunodetection procedure. Conclusions throughout this study are therefore based on comparisons made within an experiment, and where possible, within immunoblots rather than between blots. When FAK was immunoprecipitated from platelets preincubated with anti-α2 P1E6 or anti-β1 2A4 for 5 min before activation with collagen for 5 min, there was no diminution, confirmed by densitometry, in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK induced by either ligand (Fig. 2 b). Similar data were obtained using the anti-β1 mAb13 (data not shown) or the anti-α2, 6F1 (Fig. 5 b). CRP-XL induces platelet activation without involvement of α2β1 and caused substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. This shows that ligation of GpVI, the receptor for CRP-XL, induces phosphorylation of FAK. As anticipated, the anti-α2 and anti-β1 antibodies had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK by CRP-XL. Recent work in this laboratory has shown that the affinity of platelet α2β1 is dependent upon the presence of micromolar Ca2+ in the suspending medium (54Onley D.J. Knight C.G. Tuckwell D.S. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24560-24566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For this reason, the experiments shown above for collagen were repeated in the presence of a small excess of Ca2+ over EGTA in the buffer, conditions that support α2β1-dependent platelet adhesion to immobilized collagens. FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was not enhanced by the presence of Ca2+ compared with the parallel incu"

We demonstrate that an open reading frame from aDrosophila melanogaster cDNA clone encodes a protein with vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase activity. The open reading frame, 670 amino acids in length, is truncated at the C-terminal end compared with mammalian γ-carboxylase, which is 758 amino acids.

For example, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascades integrate the biochemistry of individual proteins into cellular physiology. In addition to post-translational modifications that occur primarily within cells, post-translational modifications also occur on extracellular proteins. The most familiar of these are N-glycosylation of asparagine residues and O-glycosylation of serine and threonine residues.One of the most distinctive of the extracellular post-translational modifications is the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues to give γ-carboxyglutamate (1Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). When it was first characterized, γ-carboxylation was thought to be a biochemical specialization of the mammalian blood-clotting cascade. However, several bone proteins (2Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), were subsequently identified as having the post-translational modification, although in the latter cases the precise mechanistic role of γ-carboxylation for proper protein function has not been established definitively. In addition, two novel proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing proteins, PRGP1 and PRGP2, of unknown function have been identified (5Kulman J.D. Harris J.E. Haldeman B.A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9058-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Long after its characterization in blood-clotting factors, vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues was discovered in a phylogenetically distant system: the neuropeptides made in the venom duct of the predatory cone snails Conus (6McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Craig A.G. Bandyopadhyay P. Olivera B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The venoms of these snails have ∼100 different peptides; ∼5% of these are believed to be γ-carboxylated (8Hauschka P.V. Mullen E.A. Hintsch G. Jazwinski S. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research. Science Publishers, New York1988: 237-243Google Scholar). This post-translational modification has been found in a number of diverse Conuspeptides but has been studied most intensively in an unusualConus neuropeptide family, the conantokins, which are NMDA receptor antagonists.In the conantokins, the significance of the post-translational modification can readily be demonstrated: these peptides are inactive in analogs without γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues. Incomplete γ-carboxylation of blood-clotting factors results in poor coagulation. It has been postulated that γ-carboxylation of both the conantokins and of factors of the blood-clotting cascade induces a helical conformation in the post-translationally modified regions. This postulated role of γ-carboxylation in determining conantokin structure has been generally supported by a number of subsequent structural studies on various conantokins (9Blandl T. Zajicek J.

Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Bandyopadhyay P.K. Colledge C.J. Walker C.S. Zhou L.-M. Hillyard D.R.

Despite the clear functional importance of γ-carboxylation in these two disparate phylogenetic systems, γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues has been regarded as a highly specialized post-translational modification. In this report, we provide evidence that is strongly consistent with vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation in fact being a much more widely distributed biological phenomenon. We demonstrate by molecular techniques the presence of a vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase-related protein that is expressed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which has a high degree of sequence identity with the mammalian enzyme. Similar observations have recently been reported by Li et al. (20Li T. Yang C.-T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the role of γ-carboxylation inDrosophila remains unknown, this post-translational modification is present in arthropods, suggesting that it is generally distributed in animal systems. The strong conservation in sequence of the γ-glutamyl carboxylase in Drosophila and in mammals suggests an important functional role for the enzyme, resulting in strong selection for sequence conservation.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have characterized a cDNA clone derived from adult D. melanogaster mRNA that encodes a protein with γ-glutamyl carboxylase activity. The open reading frame is homologous to the mammalian γ-glutamyl carboxylase throughout its length of 670 amino acids; the degree of sequence identity is strikingly high (39% identity and 55% homology) and comparable with the subset of enzymes highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals. One unexpected result when comparing the putative genomic DNA sequence with the cDNA is that there is an apparent small deletion in the cDNA sequence, suggesting that RNA processing of theDrosophila γ-glutamyl carboxylase mRNA occurs.Northern blot analysis indicates that the putativeDrosophila γ-glutamyl carboxylase mRNA is ∼2.7 kb in size. This is ∼350 nucleotides longer than the open reading frame and 3′-untranslated region previously characterized from cDNA. Because a single RNA isoform is observed, and the 3′-end of the RNA determined by cDNA analysis is unique, the additional 350 nucleotides represent the length of the poly(A) tail together with the 5′-untranslated region. In situ hybridization reveals the ubiquitous presence of carboxylase RNA throughout embryogenesis. By reverse transcription-PCR analysis, Li et al. (20Li T. Yang C.-T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have also reported similar observations. In early embryos (0–2 h) it is probably of maternal origin, whereas in later embryos (2–12 h), there is considerable contribution from embryonic synthesis as suggested by the kinetics of RNA synthesis. In this regard, carboxylase mRNA expression has been demonstrated in neuronal and skeletal tissue of postimplantation rat embryos during early organogenesis (26Romero E.E. Velazquez-Estades L.J. Deo R. Schapiro B. Roth D.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 243: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The discovery that a γ-carboxylase is expressed inDrosophila opens the door to genetic analysis of vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation in this model system. The availability of the Drosophila γ-glutamyl carboxylase sequence already provides significant structure-function information. Some segments are clearly much more highly conserved when theDrosophila sequence is compared with that of mammalian enzymes; presumably, these are domains of the enzyme most critical for function.

Sanchez-Vega B. Wu S. Lanir N. Stafford D.W. Solera J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in a clinical syndrome characterized by a general deficiency of blood clotting. Interestingly, this clinical condition can be treated satisfactorily by an infusion of high doses of vitamin K, consistent with an enzymatic defect in the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, reduced vitamin K. Thus, the comparison between Drosophila and mammalian enzymes may have helped define a conserved site involved in the binding of reduced vitamin K, consistent with more conventional biochemical studies.Heterologous γ-CRS sequences are not or are poorly recognized by the γ-glutamyl carboxylases. γ-CRS containing Conussubstrate, proconantokin G, is poorly carboxylated by the bovine enzyme, whereas a peptide, factor IX-18–41, which consists of the propeptide and all normally carboxylated residues of the vitamin K-dependent clotting protein factor IX, is not carboxylated by the Conus enzyme (18Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The poor carboxylation of −20Y by the Drosophila enzyme further strengthens the suggestion that the enzymes have evolved to recognize their cognate γ-CRSs. This is also supported by the observation of Li et al. (20Li T. Yang C.-T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who found that the propeptide of human blood coagulation factor IX did not stimulate carboxylation by the Drosophila enzyme. Because the Drosophila and human γ-glutamyl carboxylases share considerable sequence homology, it should be possible to identify substrate binding domains by studying carboxylation using chimeric enzymes.Because γ-carboxylated molecules may serve as signals for growth and differentiation, differential regulation of γ-carboxylation may operate at multiple levels during development. Control may be at the level of synthesis of γ-carboxylase mRNA or its translation, or both. Although mRNA may be present, enzyme activity may not be obvious. Future experiments will be aimed at determining possible differences among levels of mRNA, expressed protein, and activity by immunological methods (for protein) and γ-carboxylase assay (for activity).γ-Carboxyglutamate-containing proteins isolated to date are extracellular proteins. γ-Carboxyglutamate interacts with Ca2+, induces a conformational change in the protein, and facilitates binding to membrane phospholipids. A number of γ-carboxyglutamate-containing vitamin K-dependent proteins (thrombin, factor Xa, protein S, and Gas6) are ligands for cell surface receptors. Interaction with the receptors induces cellular proliferative responses (39Esmon C.T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 40Crosier K.E. Crosier P.S. Pathology. 1997; 29: 131-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, high levels of γ-carboxylase RNA are detected in late stage embryos. During this period, a variety of developmental and morphogenetic events occur, among them cuticle deposition and central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and gut differentiation. It is conceivable that some of the gene products signaling these events are γ-carboxylated and serve as ligands for corresponding receptors. The effects of γ-carboxylase knockout in flies will enable a systematic study of probable targets for this post-translational modification. The functions of proteins are coordinated physiologically by post-translational modification. For example, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascades integrate the biochemistry of individual proteins into cellular physiology. In addition to post-translational modifications that occur primarily within cells, post-translational modifications also occur on extracellular proteins. The most familiar of these are N-glycosylation of asparagine residues and O-glycosylation of serine and threonine residues. One of the most distinctive of the extracellular post-translational modifications is the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues to give γ-carboxyglutamate (1Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). When it was first characterized, γ-carboxylation was thought to be a biochemical specialization of the mammalian blood-clotting cascade. However, several bone proteins (2Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pan L.C. Price P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6109-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) as well as an extracellular ligand, gas6 (4Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), were subsequently identified as having the post-translational modification, although in the latter cases the precise mechanistic role of γ-carboxylation for proper protein function has not been established definitively. In addition, two novel proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing proteins, PRGP1 and PRGP2, of unknown function have been identified (5Kulman J.D. Harris J.E. Haldeman B.A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9058-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Long after its characterization in blood-clotting factors, vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues was discovered in a phylogenetically distant system: the neuropeptides made in the venom duct of the predatory cone snails Conus (6McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Craig A.G. Bandyopadhyay P. Olivera B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The venoms of these snails have ∼100 different peptides; ∼5% of these are believed to be γ-carboxylated (8Hauschka P.V. Mullen E.A. Hintsch G. Jazwinski S. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research. Science Publishers, New York1988: 237-243Google Scholar). This post-translational modification has been found in a number of diverse Conuspeptides but has been studied most intensively in an unusualConus neuropeptide family, the conantokins, which are NMDA receptor antagonists. In the conantokins, the significance of the post-translational modification can readily be demonstrated: these peptides are inactive in analogs without γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues. Incomplete γ-carboxylation of blood-clotting factors results in poor coagulation. It has been postulated that γ-carboxylation of both the conantokins and of factors of the blood-clotting cascade induces a helical conformation in the post-translationally modified regions. This postulated role of γ-carboxylation in determining conantokin structure has been generally supported by a number of subsequent structural studies on various conantokins (9Blandl T. Zajicek J. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Rigby A.C. Baleja J.D. Furie B.C. Furie B.

In the case of the blood-clotting factors, the binding to Ca2+ results in a conformational change exposing hydrophobic residues for interaction with membranes (13Myers R.A. McIntosh J.M. Imperial J.

The enzymatic reaction in the invertebrate system has recently been shown to have many striking similarities (e.g. a requirement for reduced vitamin K and the presence of a γ-carboxylation recognition site on the substrate) to that of the γ-carboxylation of factors involved in the mammalian blood-clotting cascade (18Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Bandyopadhyay P.K. Colledge C.J. Walker C.S. Zhou L.-M. Hillyard D.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5447-5450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Despite the clear functional importance of γ-carboxylation in these two disparate phylogenetic systems, γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues has been regarded as a highly specialized post-translational modification. In this report, we provide evidence that is strongly consistent with vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation in fact being a much more widely distributed biological phenomenon. We demonstrate by molecular techniques the presence of a vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase-related protein that is expressed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which has a high degree of sequence identity with the mammalian enzyme. Similar observations have recently been reported by Li et al. (20Li T. Yang C.-T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the role of γ-carboxylation inDrosophila remains unknown, this post-translational modification is present in arthropods, suggesting that it is generally distributed in animal systems. The strong conservation in sequence of the γ-glutamyl carboxylase in Drosophila and in mammals suggests an important functional role for the enzyme, resulting in strong selection for sequence conservation. DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have characterized a cDNA clone derived from adult D. melanogaster mRNA that encodes a protein with γ-glutamyl carboxylase activity. The open reading frame is homologous to the mammalian γ-glutamyl carboxylase throughout its length of 670 amino acids; the degree of sequence identity is strikingly high (39% identity and 55% homology) and comparable with the subset of enzymes highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals. One unexpected result when comparing the putative genomic DNA sequence with the cDNA is that there is an apparent small deletion in the cDNA sequence, suggesting that RNA processing of theDrosophila γ-glutamyl carboxylase mRNA occurs.Northern blot analysis indicates that the putativeDrosophila γ-glutamyl carboxylase mRNA is ∼2.7 kb in size. This is ∼350 nucleotides longer than the open reading frame and 3′-untranslated region previously characterized from cDNA. Because a single RNA isoform is observed, and the 3′-end of the RNA determined by cDNA analysis is unique, the additional 350 nucleotides represent the length of the poly(A) tail together with the 5′-untranslated region. In situ hybridization reveals the ubiquitous presence of carboxylase RNA throughout embryogenesis. By reverse transcription-PCR analysis, Li et al. (20Li T. Yang C.-T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have also reported similar observations. In early embryos (0–2 h) it is probably of maternal origin, whereas in later embryos (2–12 h), there is considerable contribution from embryonic synthesis as suggested by the kinetics of RNA synthesis. In this regard, carboxylase mRNA expression has been demonstrated in neuronal and skeletal tissue of postimplantation rat embryos during early organogenesis (26Romero E.E. Velazquez-Estades L.J. Deo R. Schapiro B. Roth D.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 243: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The discovery that a γ-carboxylase is expressed inDrosophila opens the door to genetic analysis of vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation in this model system. The availability of the Drosophila γ-glutamyl carboxylase sequence already provides significant structure-function information. Some segments are clearly much more highly conserved when theDrosophila sequence is compared with that of mammalian enzymes; presumably, these are domains of the enzyme most critical for function.

Sequence alignment of the two R subunit isoforms, RI and RII, reveals a significantly sequence diversity at this specific region. To determine whether this sequence diversity is functionally important for interaction with the catalytic subunit, specific mutations, R133A and D328A, are introduced into sites adjacent to the active site cleft in the catalytic subunit. While replacing Arg133 with Ala decreases binding affinity for RII, interaction between the catalytic subunit and RI is not affected. In contrast, mutant C(D328A) showed a decrease in affinity for binding RI while maintaining similar affinities for RII as compared with the wild-type catalytic subunit. These results suggest that sequence immediately NH2-terminal to the consensus inhibition site in RI and RII interacts with different sites at the proximal region of the active site cleft in the catalytic subunit.

These isoform-specific differences would dictate a significantly different domain organization in the type I and type II holoenzymes. cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit protein kinase A anchoring protein cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid cAMP dependent protein kinase heat stable protein kinase inhibitor Src homology domain 3 fast protein liquid chromatography The regulatory (R)1subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are multifunctional proteins that control in a variety of ways the physiological functions of this ubiquitous protein kinase (1Edelman A.M.

Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). While the R subunits have long been recognized as the primary receptor for cAMP and the major physiological inhibitor for the catalytic (C) subunit in eukaryotic cells, it is now apparent that these highly modular proteins play other important roles as well (3Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The R subunits of PKA have a well defined domain structure that consists of a dimerization domain at the NH2 terminus followed by an autoinhibitor site and two-tandem cAMP-binding domains. While the portion of the R subunit COOH-terminal to the inhibition site is responsible for high affinity binding of the C subunit and cAMP, the remaining NH2 terminus serves as an adaptor for binding to kinase anchoring proteins (3Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and other adaptor proteins, such as the SH3-containing Grb2 (4Tortora G. Damiano V. Bianco C. Baldassarre G. Bianco A.R. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Ciardiello F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This segment or region of the R subunit is responsible for in vivo subcellular localization and targeting of PKA. There are two general classes of PKA, designated as type I and type II, due exclusively to differences in the R subunits, RI and RII (5Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The existence of a family of protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that tether the type II regulatory subunits to specific subcellular structures has been well documented (3Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and AKAPs for both RI and RII (19Huang L.J.S. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have been identified recently. At present the exact physiological functions of RI and RII are not clear. However, growing evidence suggests that they are functionally different. This is supported by the fact that although the ratio of the total R subunits/C subunits in normal tissue was found to be relatively constant around 1:1, the relative amount of RI and RII varies and depends highly on physiological conditions and the hormonal status of the tissue (13Hofmann F. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Døskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 18: 63-117PubMed Google Scholar). One recent study shows that in RIIβ gene knockout mice, an increase level of RIα compensates the loss of RIIβ in brown fat cells. The switching of PKA isoform from type II to type I resulted in an increased basal level of PKA activity and increased energy expenditure. The RIIβ knockout mice are leaner and protected against diet-induced obesity (24Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate clearly that RI and RII are functionally distinct. While both RI and RII contain two tandem and highly conserved cAMP-binding domains at the carboxyl terminus (25Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), RI and RII differ significantly at their amino terminus, especially at a proteolytically sensitive hinge region that binds to the peptide recognition site of the C subunit. The hinge region of RII subunits contains a serine at the phosphorylation (P) site that can be autophosphorylated by the C subunit (26Rosen O.M. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7788-7794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); whereas RI subunits contain a pseudo phosphorylation site (Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile) and type I holoenzyme has an essential high affinity-binding site for MgATP (27Titani K. Sasagawa T. Ericsson L.H. Kumar S. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4193-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Biochemsitry. 1993; 32: 14015-14022Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When an autophosphorylation site was introduced into the RI subunit by replacing the alanine with a serine, the mutant RI subunit became a good substrate for the C subunit. However, the formation of holoenzyme was no longer facilitated by MgATP, and the affinity of the mutant holoenzyme for cAMP was independent of MgATP (29Durgerian S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9807-9813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, elimination of the autophosphorylation site by point mutation causes the RII subunit to lose its ability to revert transformed fibroblasts (30Budillon A. Cereseto A. Kondrashin A. Nesterova M. Merlo G. Clair T. Cho-Chung Y.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10634-10638Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence flanking the phosphorylation site of protein kinase substrates has been shown to be important for substrate specificity. Most PKA phosphorylation sites contain Arg at the P-3 and P-2 sites and a hydrophobic amino acid at the P+1 position (31Zetterqvist Ö. Z. Ragnarsson U. Engstrom L. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 1-41Google Scholar). A close examination of the primary sequence immediately NH2-terminal to the inhibition site of the R subunits reveals that there is significant sequence diversity between RI and RII in this region (Fig. 1). This suggests that recognition of RI and RII by the C subunit at this region could be different. We tested this hypothesis by introducing specific mutations into the NH2-terminal proximal side, an adjacent region that interacts with the sequence NH2-terminal to the inhibition site of R subunit, of the active site cleft of the C subunit. Interaction between mutant C subunits and RIα and RIIβ was then quantitatively examined by kinetic and surface plasmon resonance studies. All chemicals used are either reagent grade or molecular biology grade. Kemptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly, was synthesized at the Peptide and Oligonucleotide Facility at the University of California, San Diego, and further purified by reverse-phase preparative high performance liquid chromatography before use. The concentration of the peptide substrate was determined by turnover with the catalytic subunit under the conditions of limiting peptide. Oligonucleotides were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystem Inc., model 380B). Pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle and lactate dehydrogenase from bovine heart were from Sigma. Mutations R133A and D328A were introduced into the C subunit by the Kunkel method as described previously (32Wen W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8423-8430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant proteins C(R133A) and C(D328A) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using the pLWS-3 vector (33Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant wild-type and mutant C subunits were purified by phosphocellulose chromatography and FPLC Mono S column (34Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Isozyme II was pooled and used for all experiments. Wild type RIα was purified using DE52 anion exchange chromatography followed by FPLC gel filtration on Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (35Gibson R.M. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31998-32005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). H6-RIα was purified on nickel resin (Qiagen) and RIIβ was isolated by co-purification with H6-C using a protocol similar to that of Hemmer et al. (36Hemmer W. McGlone M. Taylor S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal volumes of E. coli cultures that overexpressed RIIβ and H6-C were mixed and co-lysed in the presence of 5 mm MgATP. After batch binding the holoenzyme onto Ni2+ resin, the free RII was eluted with 5 mm cAMP. Pooled fractions from the cAMP elution were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and further purified by FPLC gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column. To obtain cAMP-free R subunits, RIα and RIIβ were dialyzed against 8 m urea to completely remove cAMP. The chemically denatured R subunits were then refolded by dialysis to remove the urea (37Buechler Y.J. Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16495-16503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and further purified by passing through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. All proteins were at least 95% pure judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PKA holoenzymes were reconstituted from individually purified C and R subunits by mixing freshly isolated R and C subunits in a molar ration of 1:1.2 and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5% glycerol, pH 6.5) extensively at 4 °C to remove excess cAMP. The dialyzed sample was assayed for PKA activity first in the absence of cAMP and then in the presence of 100 μm cAMP to confirm the formation of the PKA holoenzyme. PKA holoenzyme complex was further purified on a Superdex 200 FPLC gel filtration column to remove excess C subunit. A typical reaction mixture (12 μl) contained 20 μg of RIα2C2holoenzyme, 35 ng of trypsin, and with or without 8 mmcAMP. The digestion reaction was started by adding the protease, and 5 μl of reaction mixture was withdrawn and mixed with 5 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer after incubating at room temperature for 10 or 30 min. The samples were boiled for 2 min and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel for analysis of the digestion products. After electrophoresis, proteins were transblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad) membrane. The electroblotting was performed in 10 mm Caps, 10% methanol (pH 11) buffer at 200 mA constant current for 1 h. After rinsing with water (3 times) and methanol, the membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie R-250 in 1% acetic acid, 40% methanol for 2 min. The membrane was destained in 50% methanol and patted dry after rinsing with water. The protein bands of interest were excised from the membrane with a razor blade and subjected to NH2-terminal protein sequencing. The enzymatic activity of the C subunit was measured spectrophotometrically with a coupled enzyme assay (38Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In this assay, the formation of the ADP is coupled to the pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase reactions. The reaction rate is determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Reactions were pre-equilibrated at room temperature and initiated by adding the peptide substrate. The Michaelis-Menten parameters for ATP and Kemptide were determined by fixing one substrate at near saturating concentration while varying the concentration of the other substrate. Inhibition of the catalytic subunit by R or PKI was assayed by mixing varying amounts of inhibitor with 20 nm C subunit and subsequently determining the decrease of phosphotransfer activity. A radioisotopic method (39Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) was also used to measure the activity of the C subunit at low concentration, typically around 100 pm. With this assay, the inhibition constants of R and PKI to the catalytic subunit can be accurately determined. The kinase reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm peptide, and 0.1 mm ATP at 100 cpm/pmol, 100 pm catalytic subunit, and varying amount of inhibitor, RIα, RIIβ, or PKI. The reaction was pre-equilibrated at room temperature for 10 min and initiated by adding the peptide substrate. Following a 10-min incubation, aliquots (45 μl) were withdrawn, spotted onto discs of Whatman P81 paper, and immediately immersed in 75 mm phosphoric acid (10–20 ml/sample) to terminate the reaction. After washing three times in phosphoric acid and once with ethanol, the discs were dried under a heating lamp. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Surface plasmon resonance was used to measure binding between wild-type/mutant C subunits and R subunits, RIα and RIIβ. C(R133A), C(D328A), and wild-type C subunits were immobilized to a sensor chip (CM dextran surface) by direct amine coupling as described previously (40Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed in running buffer containing 20 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.005% polysorbate 20, a nonionic detergent surfactant, at room temperature. For each run, five injections at different R concentrations between 30 and 500 nm were performed and sensorgrams were collected for each injection. The C subunit surface was regenerated by injection of 10 μl of 10 μm cAMP and 4 mm EDTA in running buffer following each injection of R subunit. Kinetic constants of binding were obtained using the BIAcore pseudo-first order rate equation,dRdt=KassoCRmax−(kassoC+kdissRt)Equation 1 Where k asso is the association rate,k diss is the dissociation rate, C is the concentration of injected analyte, and R is the response. The dissociation rate, k diss, was calculated by integrating the rate equation when C = 0, yielding ln(R t1/R tn) = k diss(t n −t 1). Plots of dR/dt versus Rt have a slope of k diss. Plottingk diss against C gives a slope that is equal to the k asso. Affinity constants were calculated from the equation K d =k diss/k asso. The Michaelis constant, K mand maximal velocity, V max were determined from plots of initial velocity, v versus substrate concentration, [S] according to, v=Vmax[S](Km+[S])Equation 2 The maximal velocity was then converted tok cat by dividing V max by the total enzyme concentration. The apparent inhibition constant,K i, app, was obtained directly fitting the inhibition curves of C subunits by R subunits or PKI according to,VV0=Ki,appKi,app+[I]Equation 3 where V and V 0 are the measured kinetic rate of the catalytic subunit in the presence or absence of inhibitor, respectively, [I] is the total inhibitor concentration. Since both PKI and R subunits act as competitive inhibitors of the catalytic subunit when Kemptide is used as a substrate, the inhibition constant, K a, can be further calculated from theK i,app using the Morrison equation,Ki=Ki,app1+[S]KmEquation 4 where [S] is the Kemptide concentration andK m is the Michaelis constant of catalytic subunit for Kemptide. Trypsin digestion of type I holoenzyme resulted in two stable protein fragments that corresponded to Δ(1–72)R (band A, Fig.2) and Δ(1–8)C (band B, Fig. 2) based on NH2-terminal protein sequencing. Cleavage of the holoenzyme in the presence of cAMP led to further degradation of the regulatory subunit. Between residues 72 and 92 (P-4 Arg) there are two potential trypsin cleavage sites at residues 76 and 90. The apparent protection of these two cleavage sites in the holoenzyme complex indicated that this region of the R subunit (between residues 73 and 91) was also involved in holoenzyme formation. The proteolysis results led us to focus on potential interactions between the first few residues (P-11 to P-4) that lie NH2-terminal to the consensus peptide of R subunits at the active site cleft of the C subunit. A close comparison of the structure of C:PKI-(5–24) and the isoform-specific differences between the RI and RII subunits (Fig. 1) suggested that there may be key differences in the way that the R subunits in the P-11 to P-4 region NH2-terminal to the consensus site complement the active site of the C subunit. This led us to further probe the interactions between the C subunit and R subunit isoforms by introducing two mutations (R133A and D328A) into the C subunit around the active site cleft. Mutants C(R133A) and C(D328A) expressed in E. coli to levels that were similar to the wild-type C and could be purified readily to homogeneity using conventional or co-lysis purification procedures. The purified mutants (isozyme II) phosphorylated at Ser338, Thr197, and Ser10 have atomic masses of 40,597 ± 5 and 40,642 ± 4, respectively, as determined by electron spray mass spectroscopy. These values are in good agreement with the calculated values of 40,597 and 40,638 as expected for the Arg to Ala and Asp to Ala mutations. The steady-state kinetic properties of the mutants were determined and summarized in Table I. Similar to that of the double mutant C(R133A,R134A) (32Wen W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8423-8430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutant C(R133A) showed a 2–3-fold increase in its K m for both Kemptide and ATP and a 2-fold increase in k cat. Mutant C(D328A) displayed a 2-fold increase in its K m for Kemptide while its k cat andK m for ATP remained unchanged as compared with the wild-type C.Table IKinetic parameters for mutant and wild-type C subunitC subunitk catK m, ATPK m, Kemps−1μmWT17.715.514.6R133A36.541.241.0D328A16.510.435.5 Open table in a new tab Having demonstrated that the kinetic properties of the mutant catalytic subunits were not significantly perturbed, the ability of these mutant C subunits to be inhibited by RIα, RIIβ, and PKI was tested using the spectrophotometric assay. When 20 nm of the wild-type and mutant catalytic subunits were used in the assay, cAMP-free RIα titrated the C(R133A) and wild-type C subunits stoichiometrically, indicating that the affinity of RIα for these C subunits is much lower than 20 nm. However, mutant C(D328A) required higher concentrations of RIα to be inhibited to the same extent as the wild-type C subunit. Quantitative analysis of the inhibition curve gave an apparent inhibition constant of 28 nm (Fig. 3 A) and a calculated intrinsic inhibition constant of 2.2 nm(Table II). The opposite was observed when stripped RIIβ was used. RIIβ, while it inhibited the wild-type C and C(D328A) readily, showed a decreased affinity toward C(R133A) (Fig. 3 B). The measuredK i,app and K a of RIIβ to C(R133A) were 21 and 1.9 nm, respectively (TableII). Interaction between PKI and mutant catalytic subunits were also measured. As shown in Fig. 3 C, linear inhibition curves were obtained when the wild-type and C(D328A) were titrated with PKI. In contrast, the inhibition constants of PKI to C(R133A) were 888 and 83 nm, for K i,app andK a, respectively. These results were in good agreement with the early observation (32Wen W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8423-8430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIIntrinsic inhibition constants for mutant and wild-type C subunitC subunitK i, PKIK i, RIαK i, RIIβnmWT0.260.150.10R133A830.291.9D328A0.492.20.21 Open table in a new tab The radioisotopic method was also used to study the tight interaction between catalytic subunits and R subunits and PKI so that the effects of mutations C(R133A) and C(D328A) on interaction with RIα, RIIβ, and PKI could be quantitatively assessed and compared. Since it was possible to measure the PKA activity at very low concentration (pm) with the radioisotopic method, subnanomolar affinity could be easily measured. Inhibition of 100 pm wild-type and C(D328A) catalytic subunits by PKI was measured by32P-phosphorylation of Kemptide, and the result was summarized in Fig. 4 A. It was clear that unlike C(R133A), mutant C(D328A) interacted with PKI with high affinity similar to the wild-type C-subunit. The inhibition constant, K i, for C(D328A) is 0.49 nm(Table II). The inhibition constants for RI to wild-type C and C(R133A) and for RII to wild-type C and C(D328A) were also determined (Fig. 4, B and C). These inhibition constants, summarized in Table II, established clearly that mutation of 133 reduced affinity of the C subunit for RII and PKI but not for RI. In contrast, mutation of 328 affected interaction between C and RI but not RII and PKI. As mentioned above, interaction between C(R133A) and RIα and between C(D328A) and RIIβ, was measured indirectly by the ability of these mutants to be inhibited by the R subunits. Surface plasmon resonance was used to further confirm these observations and to obtain a direct estimation of the binding affinities of these mutant C subunits to RIα and RIIβ. After immobilizing C, C(R133A), and C(D328A) to a sensor chip by amine coupling, binding of RIα and RIIβ was measured. The association and dissociation constants for wild-type, C(R133A), and C(D328A) C subunits obtained by surface plasmon resonance measurements were summarized in Table III. Overall, the association and dissociation constants for C subunit to RIα were 8 × 105m−1 s−1and 2 × 10−4 s−1, respectively. However, C(D328A) showed a slower association constant (4.5 × 105m−1 s−1) and a faster dissociation constant (5.9 × 10−4s−1). This led to an apparent K d of 1.3 nm, a 5-fold increase as compared with that of the wild-type and C(R133A) C subunits. Although the C subunit interacted with the RIIβ with similar affinity as with RIα, withK d values around 0.2 nm, both association and dissociation constants were six times faster for interaction between C subunits and RIIβ than for C subunit and RIα. In contrast to RIα, C(R133A) displayed a K d of 1 nm RIIβ, a 5-fold increase as compared with that of the wild-type C subunit, interaction between the C(D328A) and RIIβ was indistinguishable from wild-type C. This was exactly the opposite of the observation made for interaction between the C subunits and RIα, and was consistent with the inhibition data.Table IIIApparent binding constants between R and C subunits measured by surface plasmon resonanceC subunitRIαRIIβk assk dissK dk assk dissK dm−1s−1s−1nmm−1s−1s−1nmWT7.99 × 1051.86 × 10−40.235.11 × 1061.23 × 10−30.24R133A8.12 × 1052.07 × 10−40.263.21 × 1063.35 × 10−31.04D328A4.53 × 1055.88 × 10−41.305.10 × 1061.00 × 10−30.20 Open table in a new tab Two major interaction sites between the R and C subunits were defined previously (36Hemmer W.

A recent study showed that opthalmoplegia-related mutations gave rise to severe decreases in aminoacylation efficiencies and that the defective mutant tRNAs were effective inhibitors of aminoacylation of the wild-type substrate. The results suggested that the effectiveness of the mutations was due in large part to an inherently fragile mitochondrial tRNA structure. Here, we investigate mutant tRNAs associated with cardiomyopathy, and a series of rationally designed second-site substitutions introduced into both opthalmoplegia- and cardiomyopathy-related mutant tRNAs. A source of structural fragility was uncovered. An inherently unstable T-stem appears susceptible to misalignments. This susceptibility sensitizes both domains of the L-shaped tRNA structure to base substitutions that are deleterious. Thus, the fragile T-stem makes the structure of this human mitochondrial tRNA particularly vulnerable to local and distant mutations.

One domain contains the amino acid attachment site and the 12-base pair acceptor-TΨC minihelix. The other domain of 10 base pairs contains the dihydrouridine and anticodon-stem and -loop. The primary structures of hs mt tRNAs1 differ significantly from cytoplasmic tRNAs (1Martin N. Soll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 127-140Google Scholar). Despite their analogous function in the decoding of genetic information, mt tRNAs are generally shorter than cytoplasmic tRNAs and feature higher numbers of AU pairs. In some cases, entire structural elements are deformed or even missing from the canonical cloverleaf, although a truncated L-shaped structure can still be made. The minimized structures of hs mt tRNAs appear to be susceptible to point mutations, as errors in the corresponding mt genes are associated with disease. Over 70 pathology-related mutations in mt tRNA genes are known (2MITOMAP.A Human Mitochondrial Genome Database. Center for Molecular Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA2000Google Scholar). The impact of the base substitutions on the structure and function of hs mt tRNAs is difficult to predict a priori, given the limited information available concerning the properties of these molecules.Within the gene for hs mt tRNAIle, eight different point mutations are correlated with pathologies (3Tanaka M.

The opthalmoplegia mutations are associated with one specific type of structural defect, CA mispairs, whereas the cardiomyopathy mutations are more varied.The opthalmoplegia-related mutants of tRNAIle are poor substrates for aminoacylation (11Kelley S.O. Steinberg S.V. Schimmel P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7 (press): 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Studies of the reactivity of these molecules with the hs mt isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) revealed kinetic defects that impeded the aminoacylation reaction. Because the binding affinities of the mutated tRNAs for the enzyme were not affected, the mutants were effective inhibitors of the charging of wild-type tRNA. The aminoacylation of these mutant tRNAs was restored with compensatory mutations that reintroduced base pairing. These results prompted the proposal that the structure of the hs mt tRNAIle was inherently fragile and, thus, small perturbations introduced by the pathogenic mutations were magnified into large losses in function and the creation of effective inhibitors.Here, using aminoacylation to probe structure-function properties of hs mt tRNAIle, the effects of a subset of cardiomyopathy-associated mutations are investigated. An A59G mutation in the TψC-loop (hereafter called the T-loop) significantly decreased the aminoacylation efficiency of this molecule. In contrast, a C62U mutation (that introduced an AU pair in place of a CA pair within the T-stem), increased the aminoacylation efficiency. Because the C62U mutation both stabilized the T-stem and improved aminoacylation, we considered the possibility that the T-stem had an inherent fragility that affected the entire molecule. With this in mind, we set out to study systematically the effects of specific, rationally designed manipulations of the T-stem to elucidate structural properties that cause the hs mt tRNAIle to be susceptible to pathogenic mutations. These investigations were aimed at not only exploring the local consequences of mutations in the T-stem and loop, but also at seeing whether these mutations affected distant parts of the tRNA.DISCUSSIONIn the case of the opthalmoplegia-related mutations, previous work showed that these mutant hs mt isoleucine tRNAs were severely defective in aminoacylation (11Kelley S.O. Steinberg S.V. Schimmel P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7 (press): 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The effects of the mutations on the tRNA structure left the mutant tRNAs sufficiently ordered to be excellent inhibitors of aminoacylation of wild-type hs mt tRNAIle. Thus, in the potentially heteroplasmic environment of the mitochondria (24Enriquez J.A. Cabezas-Herrera J. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11207-11215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Takai D. Isobe K. Hayashi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11199-11202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with mixtures of wild-type and mutant tRNAs, the mutant tRNAs could in principle arrest protein synthesis by virtue of their ability to act as inhibitors.In contrast, whereas the A59G cardiomyopathy-associated mutation attenuates significantly aminoacylation, the C62U substitution actually improves the efficiency of charging. This improvement is plausible because the substitution strengthens the proper alignment of the T-stem by replacing an A-C pair with A-U (Fig. 3). That the aminoacylation efficiency with this mutant is actually increased through the stabilization of a canonical tRNA structure emphasizes that the nature of the connection between a pathology and a specific mutation may be different for each mutation. The higher activity of the more stable C62U mutant tRNAIle raises the possibility that the inherent fragility of the wild-type hs mt tRNA structure may be important for function. For example, among other possibilities, a flexible, relatively loose structure may be required for optimal activity with the mt translation apparatus (23Cai Y.C. Bullard J.M. Thompson N.L. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20308-20314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The inherent weakness of the structure hs mt tRNAIlegives rise to a significant degree of domain-domain communication. Because of the capacity for “slippage” in the secondary structure caused by base pair misalignments (Fig. 3), the stability of one domain is reliant on the integrity the other. (Whereas interdomain communication is prevalent in this tRNA possessing a minimized structure, it has also been detected in other tRNAs, Ref. 26Ramesh V. Varshney U. Rajbhandary U.L. RNA. 1997; 3: 1220-1232PubMed Google Scholar.) In particular, the slipped secondary structures can disrupt loose tertiary interactions and thereby make one domain particularly sensitive to perturbations in the other.Although the cause-and-effect basis for the opthalmoplegias and cardiomyopathies associated with mutations in hs mt tRNAs has not been conclusively established, these pathologies have nonetheless provided the motivation and rationale for investigating in more depth the structural features of hs mt tRNAs. In particular, were it not for the cardiomyopathy-associated mutations studied here, the fragility of the T-stem of hs mt tRNAIle might not have been appreciated. This fragility is manifested by the ease with which single point mutations can lead to serious realignments of the T-stem loop (Fig. 3) that, in turn, have consequences that are global (Fig.6). It is these global effects that may be most significant for pathology because, for example, they may influence not only aminoacylation, but also the ability of the tRNA to function in subsequent steps of protein synthesis or to be a substrate for processing or modification enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2061167587,"To define the transcriptional mechanisms contributing to stage- and tissue-specific expression of muscle genes, we performed transgenic analysis of Drosophila paramyosin gene regulation. This gene has two promoters, one for paramyosin and one for miniparamyosin, which are active in partially overlapping domains. Regions between -0.9 and -1.7 kilobases upstream of each initiation site contribute to the temporal and spatial expression patterns. By comparing the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis promoters, conserved binding sites were found for known myogenic factors, including one MEF2 site and three E boxes. In contrast with previous data, our experiments with the paramyosin promoter indicate that the MEF2 site is essential but not sufficient for proper paramyosin gene transcription. Mutations in the three E boxes, on the other hand, do not produce any effect in embryonic/larval muscles. Thus MEF2 site- and E box-binding proteins can play different roles in the regulation of different muscle-specific genes. For the miniparamyosin promoters, several conserved sequences were shown to correspond to functionally important regions. Our data further show that the two promoters work independently. Even when both promoters are active in the same muscle fiber, the transcription driven by one of the promoters is not affected by transcription driven by the other."

Glypican-1 from brefeldin A-treated cells carried heparan sulfate chains that were extensively degraded by nitrous acid at pH 3.9, indicating the presence of glucosamines with free amino groups. Chains with such residues were rare in glypican-1 isolated from unperturbed cells and from cells treated with suramin and, surprisingly, when nitrite-deprived. However, when nitrite-deprived cells were simultaneously treated with suramin, such glucosamine residues were more prevalent. To locate these residues, chains were first cleaved at linkages to sulfatedl-iduronic acid by heparin lyase and released fragments were separated from core protein carrying heparan sulfate stubs. These stubs were then cleaved off at sites linking N-substituted glucosamines to d-glucuronic acid. These fragments were extensively degraded by nitrous acid at pH 3.9. When purified proteoglycan isolated from brefeldin A-treated cells was incubated with intact cells, endoheparanase-catalyzed degradation generated a core protein with heparan sulfate stubs that were similarly sensitive to nitrous acid. We conclude that there is a concentration ofN-unsubstituted glucosamines to the reducing side of the endoheparanase cleavage site in the transition region between unmodified and modified chain segments near the linkage region to the protein. Both sites as well as the heparin lyase-sensitive sites seem to be in close proximity to one another."

These receptor mutants have deletions in their extracellular ligand-binding domains and are, therefore, no longer regulated by ligand, resulting in constitutive activation of the receptor kinase. These mutants have been proposed to transduce oncogenic signals via ligand-independent signaling pathways. Avian viral homologues of these oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptors exhibit structurally homologous deletions and form tumors in chickens. One such mutant, S3v-ErbB, transforms fibroblasts in vitro, and transformation has been correlated with the formation of a novel tyrosine phosphoprotein complex. V-ErbB-mediated complex formation and transformation have been shown to occur independently of Ras activation. The major aims of this study are to further characterize this ligand-independent v-ErbB oncogenic signaling pathway. Here we show that both v-ErbB-mediated phosphoprotein complex formation and transformation are inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Rho. This inhibition is specific for dominant negative Rho; dominant negative mutants of Rac and Cdc42 have no effect on transformation or on tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphoprotein complex. Based on these observations, we propose that S3v-ErbB stimulates a Rho-dependent tyrosine kinase, resulting in complex formation and ultimately oncogenic transformation.

This growth pattern has been correlated with specific cytoskeletal changes in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (2McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Specifically, stress fibers are disassembled, and myosin light chain kinase activity is reduced (2McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, two cytoskeletal associated proteins, i.e. caldesmon and p21-activated kinase, are uniquely tyrosine-phosphorylated in S3v-ErbB-transformed cells (2McManus M.J. Lingle W.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35328-35334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ras activation, a key aspect of ligand-dependent EGFR mitogenic signaling, is not required for S3v-ErbB-mediated transformation or for these cytoskeletal changes (5Boerner J. McManus M. Martin G. Maihle N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that ligand-independent oncogenic signaling occurs through a pathway that is distinct from the well characterized ligand-dependent mitogenic signaling pathway of EGFR. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are small GTP-binding proteins important in the dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton of the cell. Rho is a crucial regulator of such cytoskeletal events and functions by controlling stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion formation (6Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rac is important for membrane ruffling, lamellipodia formation, and focal complex formation (7Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas Cdc42 is required for filopodia formation (11Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The coordinated interplay of the activities of these proteins results in the control of complex biological events such as cell movement, cell-cell communication, cell growth, and cell death. When the regulatory activity of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 is altered, dramatic changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton, as well as deregulation of these biological functions, occurs, resulting in pathologic effects such as malignant transformation. Because we previously have shown that Ras activity is not required for S3v-ErbB transformation, in this study we have examined the role of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in S3v-ErbB-mediated primary fibroblast transformation. Our results demonstrate that Rho activity is essential for S3v-ErbB-mediated fibroblast transformation, whereas the loss of Rac or Cdc42 activity does not inhibit transformation. In support of this observation, expression of a dominant negative RhoA mutant inhibits the formation of a previously described transformation-associated tyrosine phosphoprotein complex. These data implicate Rho, as well as downstream mediators of Rho signaling, as important mediators of S3v-ErbB-mediated complex formation and transformation in fibroblasts. These results have important implications for ligand-independent signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases and may be particularly relevant to the development of novel therapeutics capable of uniquely targeting oncogenic signaling pathways. Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% chick serum at 37 °C. RCAN-based retroviral vectors were used for coinfection studies (12Hughes S. Kosik E. Virology. 1984; 136: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). E1v-ErbB (a nontransforming, but constitutively active, form of v-ErbB) and S3v-ErbB were cloned into RCAN BH env subgroup A, and dominant negative Rho (N19RhoA, a gift from A. Hall), dominant negative Rac (N17Rac, a gift from A. Ridley), and dominant negative Cdc42 (N17Cdc42, a gift from M. Symons) were cloned into RCAS BH env subgroup B. Low passage CEF were infected with RCAS (B)-N19RhoA, N17Rac1, N17Cdc42, or vector only for 3 days. Cells were passaged 1:3 and were subsequently infected with RCAN (A)-E1v-ErbB, S3v-ErbB, or vector in the presence of 2 mg/ml polybrene for 4 days as described previously (5Boerner J. McManus M. Martin G. Maihle N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). Coinfected CEF were plated at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm2 plate and were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPPi, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% deoxycholate, 4 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Ten micrograms of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with antibodies (diluted 1:500) against EGFR (13Maihle N.J. Raines M.A. Flickinger T.W. Kung H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4868-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Rho (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Myc tag (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature, followed by incubation in anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed again as above and incubated with chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) for 5 min, followed by analysis using a lumi-imager (Gel Expert, Nucleotech). Equal amounts of lysates (500 μg) from CEF coexpressing v-ErbB and DNRho, DNRac, or DNCdc42 were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Shc antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads were added to the lysates for 30 min at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitates were then washed and analyzed as described previously. CEF coexpressing v-ErbB and DNRho, DNRac, and DNCdc42 were plated as previously described (14Connolly D. Toutenhoofd S. Maihle N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6804-6810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plates were supplemented with a few drops of media every 3 days, for a total culture time of 3 weeks. Colonies (>25 cells/colony) were counted by bright field light microscopy. Coinfected cultures of cells were maintained throughout the soft agar colony incubation. The average number of colonies for S3v-ErbB CEF was normalized to 100 for comparison between replicates. Each experiment consisted of four replicates and was repeated four times. The ratio of GTP- to GDP-bound Rho was determined as described previously (15Johnson J.L. Fenton S. Sheffield L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21574-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, CEF and N19RhoA expressing CEF were serum-starved for 24 h, metabolically labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid/4 ml of phosphate-free media for 4 h at 37 °C, and stimulated with 50 nm transforming growth factor-α (TGFα). Cells were lysed in Rho extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Rho (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GDP and GTP were eluted from the immunocomplexes in 1 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.4) at 100 °C for 3 min. Eluants were separated using thin-layer chromatography developed in 1m KH2PO4 (pH 4.5), and chromatograms were exposed to x-ray film. Dominant negative mutants of Rho (N19RhoA), Rac (N17Rac), or Cdc42 (N17Cdc42) were subcloned into the replication-competent avian retrovirus, RCAS, and these recombinant viruses were used to infect primary CEF. A coinfection strategy for CEF has previously been developed such that sequential infection of CEF with two distinct envelope subtypes of RCAS allows for coexpression of two different genes of interest. Fig. 1illustrates representative Western blot analyses of fibroblasts coexpressing a nontransforming but constitutively active form of v-ErbB, E1v-ErbB, or the transforming S3v-ErbB and each of these dominant negative mutants. The expression of the v-ErbB mutants does not alter the endogenous expression levels of Rac, Cdc42, or Rho (Fig.1). CEF expressing S3v-ErbB form a tyrosine phosphoprotein complex that coprecipitates with anti-Shc antibodies; this complex includes the proteins Grb2, Shc, and caldesmon (2McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CEF lysates from cells coinfected with dominant negative mutants of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Shc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology). Fig. 2 shows that in the presence of vector alone, N17Rac, or N17Cdc42, the formation of this complex is not inhibited. In contrast, in CEF coexpressing N19RhoA and S3v-ErbB the formation of this complex is completely inhibited, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc also is significantly reduced although the levels of immunoprecipitated Shc remained constant (data not shown and Fig. 2). S3v-ErbB-expressing CEF form colonies in soft agar, a characteristic consistent with the ability of transformed cells to grow in the absence of cell adhesion. To determine whether N19RhoA, N17Rac, or N17Cdc42 expression would affect S3v-ErbB-induced anchorage-independent cell growth, coinfected CEF were plated in soft agar as previously described.2 After 3 weeks of growth, colonies were counted, and the number of colonies found in S3v-ErbB CEF was defined as 100% colony formation. As shown in Fig.3, N19RhoA completely inhibits S3v-ErbB-mediated soft agar colony formation. Interestingly, N17Rac and N17Cdc42 also modestly reduce the number of soft agar colonies formed, but never to a statistically significant extent. The reduction in soft agar colony formation is not the result of a reduction or inhibition of cell growth. Cultures of coinfected cells grown in parallel with the soft agar plates did not exhibit altered growth rates when compared with control cells (data not shown). To determine whether S3v-ErbB constitutive tyrosine kinase activity results in constitutive activation of Rho, CEF expressing E1v-ErbB or S3v-ErbB were plated, followed by serum starvation for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with 50 nmTGFα and metabolically labeled with32Pi. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Rho antibodies, and the associated nucleotides were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The resultant chromatogram was analyzed using computer-aided densitometry. Fig. 4illustrates a graphical representation of these data. These results indicate that the level of Rho activity in CEF expressing S3v-ErbB is comparable with the level of Rho activation seen in α-stimulated cells. In contrast, cells expressing E1v-ErbB exhibit Rho activity levels comparable with the basal levels observed in serum-starved cells. These results suggest that constitutive tyrosine kinase activity (e.g. of the nontransforming E1v-ErbB mutant) is not sufficient to stimulate constitutive Rho activity. In addition, S3v-ErbB-expressing fibroblasts do not exhibit constitutive activation of Rac (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest a unique role for Rho in S3v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. S3v-ErbB has been shown to mediate fibroblast transformation through a Ras-independent signaling mechanism (5Boerner J. McManus M. Martin G. Maihle N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have performed experiments to identify components of this ligand-independent oncogenic signaling pathway that might connect S3v-ErbB to its tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream mediators, such as caldesmon and p21-activated kinase (2McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Perona R. Esteve P. Jimenez B. Ballestero R.P. Ramon y Cajal S. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wang Z. Danielsen A. Maihle N. McManus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33807-33813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our results suggest the existence of a ligand-independent oncogenic signaling pathway from S3v-ErbB to the small GTP-binding protein Rho. The activation of Rho apparently leads to the stimulation of at least one tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates components of a previously described transformation-associated phosphoprotein complex. Here, we demonstrate that Rho activity is required for S3v-ErbB-mediated phosphoprotein complex formation. Of particular interest, Rho activation is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of several components of this signaling complex including caldesmon and p21-activated kinase (data not shown). Careful observation also reveals a decrease in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation; Shc tyrosine phosphorylation is characteristically elevated in S3v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. These data, therefore, suggest the involvement of at least one tyrosine kinase downstream of Rho activation. In this regard, several known tyrosine kinases have been implicated downstream of Rho activation, as well as downstream of cytoskeletal changes within the cell, particularly in transformed cells. One such tyrosine kinase, Src, has been shown to function downstream of Rho via several mechanisms; Src-phosphorylated proteins have been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of Rho, and Src and Rho share a common mediator linking them in this signaling pathway (16Cobb B. Schaller M. Leu T. Parsons J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 17Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Specifically, Src has been shown to phosphorylate the cytoskeletal proteins focal adhesion kinase (Fak) and p130cas (16Cobb B. Schaller M. Leu T. Parsons J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 18Flinn H.M. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bockholt S. Burridge K. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1995; 3: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Bergman M. Joukov V. Virtanen I. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 711-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More significantly, recent investigations have linked Rho and Src activation through the Rho effector mDia (17Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The Diaphanous-related formins, namely mDia1 and mDia2, have been shown to act as effectors for Rho activation and to link the tyrosine kinase activity of Src to Rho activation by acting as scaffolding or bridging proteins (17Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that Src may be the critical kinase involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of components of our transformation-associated phosphotyrosine protein complex, and future studies will be directed toward testing this hypothesis. Fak is another tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be required for the cytoskeletal changes observed as a consequence of Rho activation. Specifically, Fak has been shown to be a downstream Rho effector. Stimuli that activate Rho, e.g. sphingolipids, also result in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fak (21Enomoto T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 22Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24343-24351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Wang F. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Spiegel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). More directly, Fak has been shown to be autophosphorylated as well as phosphorylated by other kinases, e.g. by Src family kinases, in a Rho-dependent fashion (24Schaller M. Hildebrand J. Shannon J. Fox J. Vines R. Parsons J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 25Richardson A. Parsons J. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Of additional interest relevant to this study, EGF can indirectly stimulate Rho activation, leading to increased activity of Src, as well as to the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fak. These observations suggest that Fak also might be an excellent candidate for the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of our Shc-based phosphoprotein complex (26Brunton V.G. Ozanne B.W. Paraskeva C. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Evidence for yet a third candidate tyrosine kinase,i.e. Abl, although less compelling, is still worth a mention. Abl has been shown to be critical for several of the actin-based cytoskeletal changes correlated with transformation. For example, in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells, it is the kinase activity of Abl that is critical for the cytoskeletal changes resulting in morphological transformation (27Gaston I. Stenberg P. Bhat A. Druker D. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The specific cytoskeletal alterations correlated with v-Abl transformation of fibroblasts require Abl-binding partners and substrates, such as ArgB2 and c-Cbl (28Wang B. Golemis E. Kruh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17542-17550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Feshchenko E. Shore S. Tsygankov A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3703-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, Abl itself contains an F-actin-binding domain that competes with gelsolin and is critical for F-actin bundling (30Van Etten R. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Sanders M. Matsudaira P. Janmey P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Abl also may be a tyrosine kinase downstream of Rho activation, providing yet another testable candidate for the kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphoprotein complex observed in S3v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. This study also demonstrates that Rho is constitutively activated in S3v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts, suggesting that a constitutive signal from S3v-ErbB to Rho may be critical for expression of the phenotypes observed. In contrast, E1v-ErbB does not constitutively activate Rho, suggesting that more than just a constitutively active tyrosine kinase leads to Rho activation. These observations also demonstrate that although many pathways may be activated by constitutively active S3v-ErbB, only the pathway to Rho has escaped normal regulation by governing proteins, such as the GTPase-activating proteins. In this regard, studying aspects of regulating Rho activity in v-ErbB-transformed cells may be informative. Recently, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav has been implicated in Rho activation via EGF stimulation of the EGFR (31Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Specifically, tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 by the EGFR in response to EGF stimulation activates Rho (32Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast, other activators of Rho,i.e. Ost, Lbc, and Trio have not been shown to be regulated by EGF. Additional studies will be needed to determine whether Vav family members are the missing link between S3v-ErbB oncogenic signaling and Rho activation. Even though we demonstrate here that Rho activity is required for transformation of fibroblasts by S3v-ErbB, it remains a point of controversy whether expression of a constitutively active Rho is sufficient for fibroblast transformation. It has been shown, however, that constitutive activation of Rho can transform fibroblasts in the presence of constitutively active Raf (Raf-CAAX) (33Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The authors of this particular study conclude that these two pathways are required for transformation of fibroblasts via Rho; one pathway is independent of Raf activity and regulates stress fiber dynamics, and a second pathway is dependent on Raf activity (33Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho and Rac also have been shown to cooperate in the transformation of fibroblasts (34Avraham H. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2058-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rho also has been implicated in the regulation of the EGFR endosomal trafficking, such that the EGFR is delayed from moving past the late endosome when Rho is constitutively active (35Gampel A. Parker P.J. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 955-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The regulation of S3v-ErbB trafficking may perhaps provide an alternate mechanism for the contribution of Rho in S3v-ErbB-mediated transformation. Furthermore, constitutive activation of proteins shown to regulate the activity of Rho, such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc, also have the ability to induce anchorage-independent cell growth (36Schwartz M.A. Toksoz D. Khosravi-Far R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6525-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, several investigators have demonstrated that the overexpression of a constitutively activated mutant Rho directly leads to the formation of tumors in nude mice (3Perona R. Esteve P. Jimenez B. Ballestero R.P. Ramon y Cajal S. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar, 37Avraham H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be required to determine the basis for these discrepancies and to more precisely define the relationship between the role of Rho in regulating stress fiber dynamics versus transformation. In conclusion, we believe that Rho plays a critical role in the transformation of fibroblasts by S3v-ErbB. We further hypothesize that Rho is constitutively activated by signals downstream of S3v-ErbB and that the normal regulatory proteins governing Rho activation are either outnumbered or disregulated themselves in S3v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. This constitutive activation of Rho leads to the constitutive activation of a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, such as Src, Fak, or Abl, resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a signaling complex of proteins including Shc, caldesmon, and p21-activated kinase. These tyrosine phosphorylation events not only result in cytoskeletal changes such as stress fiber disassembly, but also provide signals that lead to the transformation of fibroblasts. Together, these observations support the working hypothesis that ligand-independent oncogenic signaling by S3v-ErbB is distinct from the ligand-dependent mitogenic pathway that regulates normal cell division. Further delineation of this putative oncogenic signaling pathway may reveal new therapeutic targets unique to transformed cells.

https://openalex.org/W1990732905,"We have shown here that the cytosolic bacterial chaperone SecB is a structural dimer of dimers that undergoes a dynamic equilibrium between dimer and tetramer in the native state. We demonstrated this equilibrium by mixing two tetrameric species of SecB that can be distinguished by size. We showed that the homotetrameric species exchanged dimers, because when the mixture was analyzed both by size exclusion chromatography and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis a third hybrid tetrameric species was detected. Furthermore, treatment of SecB with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), which modifies the sulfhydryl group on cysteines, caused irreversible dissociation to a dimer indicating that cysteine must be involved in the stabilizing interactions at the dimer interface. It is clear that the two dimer-dimer interfaces of the SecB tetramer are differentially stable. Dissociation at one interface allows for a dynamic dimer-tetramer equilibrium. Because only dimers were exchanged it is clear that the other interface between dimers is significantly more stable, otherwise oligomers should have formed with a random distribution of monomers.

It binds precursors of exported proteins, maintaining them in a state that is competent for membrane translocation, and delivers them to SecA, the peripheral ATPase of the membrane translocase (reviewed in Ref. 1Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SecB is a homotetramer of molecular weight 68,600 (2Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Homotetramers can be of two structural sorts. Either they are cyclic tetramers, which have 4-fold symmetry (C4), or they are dimers of dimers, which display dihedral symmetry (D2). Two previous studies have suggested that SecB is a dimer of dimers (2Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Murén E.M. Suciu D. Topping T.B. Kumamoto C.A. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19397-19402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of SecB at pH 11 showed that the tetramer dissociated into dimers (2Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and size exclusion chromatography of three bacterial lysates containing SecB species produced by mutated secB genes gave evidence for the existence of a species that eluted at a position consistent with that expected for a dimer (3Murén E.M. Suciu D. Topping T.B. Kumamoto C.A. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19397-19402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, a study using differential scanning calorimetry concluded that SecB is likely to be a cyclic tetramer, because there was no evidence of dimer intermediates in the thermal unfolding of SecB to monomers (4Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Aloor J.J. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The previous studies (2Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19397-19402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) indicating that SecB is a structural dimer of dimers required the use of mutationally altered species of SecB or extreme conditions of pH to cause dissociation into dimers. This is the first use of wild-type SecB in a demonstration that it is structurally a dimer of dimers. In addition, we show that under physiological conditions one dimer interface is considerably more stable than the other so that the homotetramer undergoes a dynamic dimer-tetramer equilibrium. SecB was purified as described (5Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Smith V.F. Diamond D.D. Hardy S.J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 444-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). SecB142, a form of SecB that is truncated at amino acid 142 of a total of 155 amino acids, was purified from strain CK2212 (BL21(λDE3) secB::Tn5,srl::Tn10 recA1) containing a plasmid carrying the secB142 gene under control of the T7 promoter (6Volkert T.L. Baleja J.D. Kumamoto C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in M9 minimal medium (7Miller J.H Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 4 μg/ml thiamine, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. Induction and purification were as described for SecB (5Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Smith V.F. Diamond D.D. Hardy S.J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 444-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A version of SecB that is truncated at amino acid 141 was generated for some experiments from purified wild-type SecB by proteolysis with proteinase K as described (8Diamond D.L. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28994-28998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whenever this form of truncated SecB was used, a solution containing an equivalence of proteinase K inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the sample containing the full-length SecB. Wild-type SecB and truncated SecB were dialyzed into 30 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.6, and mixed at room temperature so that the final concentration of each was 22 μm and were then subjected to native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with little or no delay. To observe exchange of monomers of SecB, 90 μm wild-type SecB, 90 μm truncated SecB, and a mixture of 45 μmof each species in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm KOAc, pH 7.6, were unfolded by dilution into 2 volumes of 9 m urea (ultrapure urea; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In the control, two volumes of water were added instead of the urea. The samples were incubated at 24 °C for 30 min followed by 3 h at 0 °C. Refolding was initiated by rapid dilution of one volume of denatured SecB with 22 volumes of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMg(OAc)2. All samples were then dialyzed against 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.6, before being applied to gels. Cysteine residues on SecB were modified by treatment with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB1 or Ellman's reagent; Sigma). DTNB (1.6 mm) was added to SecB (40 μm) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA in a total volume of 0.6 ml and incubated at 23 °C for 2 h. After treatment SecB could be resolved into two peaks by high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK G3000SW size exclusion column (60 cm × 7.5 mm; TosoHaas) equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mmKOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2. To optimize resolution multiple chromatography runs were performed using a 200-μl sample volume. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected for each run, and the 4 fractions containing the SecB in the later eluting peak were pooled, concentrated using a Centricon10 (Amicon), and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EGTA. The concentration of the protein was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. MIANS-SecB was generated as described (8Diamond D.L. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28994-28998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MIANS-SecB or SecB was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and suspended in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate and 7.2 m urea. For V8 protease digestion the sample was diluted to contain 1 mg/ml SecB, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 2 m urea. V8 protease was added to 40 μg/ml, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The proteolytically generated fragments were separated by reversed phase high performance chromatography on a Jupiter (Phenomonex) C4 column using a gradient of acetonitrile in 10 mm triethylamine acetate, pH 6. Selected fractions were analyzed by ProteinChip® array and surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA). Denaturing polyacrylamide (15%) gel electrophoresis was performed as described (9Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For native polyacrylamide (9%) gel electrophoresis the procedure was the same with the exception that SDS was not included in any solutions, and samples were not boiled. High performance liquid size exclusion chromatography was performed on a TSK G3000SW column in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EGTA. The elution profiles were monitored by multiangle laser light scattering at 690 nm and differential refractometry (DAWN-EOS and Optilab instruments, respectively; Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). The molar mass was determined using a specific refractive index increment of 0.195 and the Debye plotting formalism of the Astra software supplied by Wyatt Technology Corp. Full-length SecB can be distinguished from versions truncated at the C terminus that are missing either 14 aminoacyl residues, generated by mild proteolysis, or 13 aminoacyl residues, produced as the product of a modified secB gene, on the basis of the reduction in size. Previous analysis has shown that the truncated SecB exists as a tetramer and is active in binding ligand although with a lower apparent affinity (2Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Diamond D.L. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28994-28998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Analysis of the proteins in their native tetrameric state shows that when subjected to size exclusion chromatography separately, full-length SecB elutes at a position well ahead of that of the truncated species (Fig. 1,upper panel, compare dotted and dashed lines). When the two species of SecB are mixed before application to the column, a species is detected that elutes at a position between that of the pure homotetrameric species of SecB (Fig. 1, upper panel, solid line). Examination of the protein content of the eluted fractions by SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis showed that the intermediate peak contained both wild-type and truncated monomers, indicating the existence of a dynamic equilibrium by which subunits of the tetramers were exchanging (Fig. 1, lower panel). The exchange of subunits was also evident when equimolar mixtures of wild-type SecB and truncated SecB were subjected to nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). When applied separately the two species of SecB were well resolved (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1and 6 with 3 and 8), whereas three stained bands were observed when the mixture was analyzed. Two of the bands corresponded to the homotetrameric full-length and the homotetrameric truncated species of SecB, and the third band was observed midway between the two. The same ratio of the three species was seen whether the proteins were mixed when loading into the sample well (lane 2) or incubated together either for 17 min or overnight before loading (lane 4 and 5, respectively). The presence of only three bands strongly indicates that the two species of SecB exchanged only dimers and thus that SecB is a dimer of dimers. If it were instead a cyclic tetramer that exchanged monomers, or indeed a dimer of dimers in which the two different dimer interfaces were of near equal stability, one would expect to see in this experiment three intermediate bands between the homotetrameric species, representing the 3:1, 2:2, and 1:3 monomer compositions of the tetrameric species. This expectation was realized when a mixture of full-length and truncated SecB species were denatured in 6 m urea and refolded in the same solution by dilution of the denaturant. Five bands representing all five possible tetrameric species were seen on the gel (Fig. 2, lane 7) indicating that the tetramers had assembled from monomers. This experiment therefore serves as a control for the spontaneous exchange of dimers from the native state, because it demonstrates that if monomers were exchanging we would have seen three intermediate species not just the one observed. When full-length and truncated SecB are refolded separately and then mixed, as expected only three bands were present indicating an exchange of dimers (Fig. 2,lane 9). We conclude that the tetramer dissociates as dimers from the native state, and the protein must be denatured to populate the monomer state. An interesting and confirmatory feature of the gels shown in Fig. 2 is the appreciable diffuse staining between the visible bands of the lanes that contained mixtures of the two types of SecB, reflecting the continuous re-equilibration of the SecB species as they migrate through the gel. Material migrating beyond the position of the homotetrameric full-length SecB comprises tetramers of either two truncated dimers or hybrid tetramers of one truncated dimer and one full-length dimer. Whenever two full-length dimers derived from the dissociation of the hybrid tetramer form a tetramer, they migrate more slowly whereas two truncated dimers that form a tetramer migrate more rapidly than does the hybrid tetramer. This re-equilibration may account for the fact that the central band of the three, which would be expected to contain twice as much material as either the upper or lower band (assuming equal affinities for association of the different dimers), is relatively depleted in Fig. 2, lanes 2,4, 5, and 9. SecB, which contains four cysteine residues per monomer, was treated with dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB or Ellman's reagent) to form adducts with sulfhydryl groups. After a 10-min incubation with the reagent, the equivalent of a single adduct per monomer had formed, and analysis of the reaction mixture by size exclusion chromatography showed that SecB eluted in the normal position (16 ml) for the tetramer with only a small amount of the material eluting later at 17.5 ml (Fig.3, dashed line). Prolonged incubation with the reagent resulted in modification of more than one cysteine per monomer (1.2 at 60 min and 1.6 at 130 min) with a concomitant increase in the later- eluting species (Fig. 3,dotted and solid lines). To establish the oligomeric state of the later-eluting species the proteins were analyzed using an on-line multiangle static light-scatter detector that allows direct determination of molar mass. The intensity of light scattered is proportional to the product of the molar mass and the concentration of the particle under investigation. Thus it is apparent by simply comparing the profiles of light-scatter intensity (Fig. 4 A, solid line) and protein concentration as determined by change in refractive index (Fig. 4 A, dashed line) that the later peak has about half of the mass of the earlier peak, because for the same concentration the light scattered had half the intensity. To accurately determine the mass it was necessary to subject the later-eluting peak to chromatography a second time to remove any unresolved tetrameric species, because their presence would increase the weight average molecular mass (Fig. 4 B). The molar mass calculated was 35,000, a value that is very near the expected molar mass of 34,300 for the dimeric form of SecB. The molar mass of unmodified SecB was also determined in the same manner to be 72,000. The accepted molar mass of the SecB tetramer is 68,600 (2Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Figure 4Molar mass of DTNB-treated SecB. A, SecB was modified with DTNB for 2 h and applied to a TSK G3000SW column. The light- scattering intensity from the 90° detector (solid line) and the refractive index signal (dashed line) are shown. B, unmodified SecB (dotted line) or modified SecB isolated as the later-eluting peak (solid line) was injected onto a TSK G3000SW column. The refractive index signal is displayed with the molar mass calculated for each successive 0.03-ml slice along the peak (SecB dimer,xxxx; SecB, ++++).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The SecB dimer generated by DTNB modification did not redistribute to a mixture of tetramer and dimer when reapplied to the column. We conclude that this dimer can not reassociate with another dimer to form a tetramer. It should be noted that even with longer incubation with DTNB, monomers were not generated. This observation reinforces the conclusion drawn from the demonstration of the spontaneous dissociation; SecB is a dimer of dimers. Because a tetramer exhibiting dihedral symmetry has two different interfaces between dimers it was of interest to determine whether the interface that was disrupted by chemical modification was the same interface as that involved in spontaneous dissociation. If the interface dissociating spontaneously were different from that modified by DTNB then one would expect the dimers generated by the modification to be able to exchange monomers by spontaneous dissociation at the other, unmodified interface. This was not the case as demonstrated using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of mixtures of the dimeric forms of wild-type SecB and truncated SecB, each generated by treatment with DTNB. No hybrid heterodimeric species were detected (data not shown). We previously reported that modification of cysteine by the fluorescent reagent MIANS reduced the apparent affinity of SecB for ligands (8Diamond D.L. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28994-28998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but did not result in a change of the oligomeric state as assessed by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). However, treatment of the MIANS-modified SecB with DTNB did not result in generation of dimers (Fig. 5, dotted line) as DTNB modification does for SecB (Figs. 3 and 5, solid line). Therefore it seems that although modification of cysteine by MIANS does not itself generate dimers it does protect the crucial cysteine from reaction with DTNB. There are four cysteinyl residues in SecB, at positions 76, 97, 102 and 113, that are candidates for modification. Mass spectrometry of peptide mixtures derived from proteolytic digestion of MIANS-modified SecB revealed the presence of a peptide with a mass corresponding to amino acid 78 to 112 carrying one MIANS adduct. Thus it is likely that either Cys-97 or Cys-102 lies at the dimer interface. However, because both cysteine residues Cys-97 and Cys-102 lie within the same fragment we could not determine which was modified. Unambiguous identification of the cysteine modified was further complicated by the fact that at least 2 different cysteine residues were modified both by MIANS and by DTNB. This is indicated by the kinetics of modification by DTNB, as well as by mass spectrometry of MIANS-modified SecB, before proteolytic digestion. When reaction with MIANS was terminated at a molar ratio of 1.6 adducts per monomer, mass spectrometry revealed a mixture of polypeptides carrying 0, 1, or 2 MIANS moieties (data not shown). We assessed numerous other reagents that modify aminoacyl side chains (bromoethylamine and 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (Fig. 5, dashed line), which modify cysteines and succinic anhydride, acetic anhydride, and citraconic anhydride, which modify lysines (data not shown)); none of the modifications resulted in dissociation of the SecB tetramer as assessed by size exclusion chromatography. A homotetramer might be either a cyclic tetramer, in which the interactions at the interface of monomers are all identical (Fig.6 A), or it could be a dimer of dimers in which there are two different interacting interfaces (Fig.6 B). The two sorts of tetramers may be distinguished by the manner in which the subunits dissociate. For cyclic tetramers, because all of the interacting sites are identical, the probability that any one monomer dissociates is equal. Therefore either all four monomers would dissociate simultaneously, or if intermediate states were populated there would be dimers and trimers, as well as monomers. In contrast, because there are two different interactions stabilizing the two dimer interfaces in a dimer of dimers (Fig. 6 B) one interface may be significantly more stable than the other, resulting in dissociation to dimers. We have used two different approaches to investigate the oligomeric state of SecB. In the first approach we showed that SecB in the native state is in a dynamic equilibrium between dimer and tetramer. Two tetrameric species of SecB, one full-length and the other truncated, were mixed. A third tetrameric species containing one wild-type dimer and one dimer of the truncated species formed spontaneously indicating the existence of a dimer-tetramer equilibrium. To detect monomer exchange, the tetramers had to be fully denatured in 6 murea and then refolded with both species of SecB present. We conclude that SecB is structurally a dimer of dimers and that one of the two interfaces is significantly more stable than the other. If both interfaces were of approximately equal energy of stabilization dissociation at each would occur with equal probability leading to formation of tetramers with all possible combination of subunits as was seen with monomer exchange. In the second approach, tetrameric wild-type SecB was induced to dissociate irreversibly by treatment with DTNB, which forms adducts with cysteine residues. The only species observed after prolonged treatment were dimers. Thus there must be at least one cysteine at the interface of the dimers. Because the SecB dimer created by modification of cysteine did not exchange monomers, we conclude that the interface destabilized by DTNB modification is the same interface that dissociates spontaneously.
