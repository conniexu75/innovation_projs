https://openalex.org/W2002409151,A technique for measuring the latency of the P300 component of event-related brain potentials on individual trials is described. Choice reaction times and the latency of the P300 were compared under speed-maximizing and under accuracy-mazimising instructions. The choice stimuli required different levels of semantic categorization. The data support the proposition that the latency of P300 corresponds to stimulus evaluation time and is independent of response selection.
https://openalex.org/W1979612418,Three-month-old rats were injected intraperitoneally with [3H]thymidine (4.3 microcuries per gram of body weight) and allowed to survive for 30 days. Radioautography of 1-micrometer sections revealed labeled cells in the granular layers of dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb; these were confirmed as neurons by electron microscopy of reembedded 1-micrometer sections.
https://openalex.org/W1998811052,Clones derived in vitro from a parent culture of murine malignant melanoma cells varied greatly in their ability to produce metastatic colonies in the lungs upon intravenous inoculation into syngeneic mice. This suggests that the parent tumor is heterogeneous and that highly metastatic tumor cell variants preexist in the parental population.
https://openalex.org/W2066800745,"Abstract Evidence is presented that crown gall tumors are caused by the incorporation of part of a virulence plasmid carried by the inciting bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The rate of reassociation of labeled plasmid DNA was slightly accelerated in the presence of tobacco crown gall tumor DNA, but not normal tobacco DNA. Treatment of tumor DNA with DNAase abolished the acceleration. To determine whether all plasmid sequences are represented in tumor DNA, the labeled plasmid DNA was separated into specific fragments after digestion with restriction endonuclease Sma I. Renaturation rates for DNA from bands 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 14 were not affected by tumor DNA. DNA from band 3 showed a slight rate increase in the presence of tumor DNA, indicating 21–27 copies of 14–18% of the DNA sequences in this (doublet) band. The band 3 doublet was separated by electrophoresis into bands 3a and 3b. Tumor DNA had little effect on the rate of reassociation of labeled band 3a DNA. Band 3b DNA renatured rapidly in the presence of tumor DNA, and its rate increase indicated that approximately 18 copies of 40% of band 3b DNA sequences are present per diploid tumor cell. This amounts to 3.7 × 10 6 daltons of foreign genetic information and represents a contribution of 0.0011% to the DNA content of the tumor cell. The relationship between this plant tumor and virally induced animal tumor systems is discussed."

This protein is present in the cornified envelope, a structure located beneath the plasma membrane. When cornified envelopes were dissolved by exhaustive proteolytic digestion and the products analyzed by chromatography, approximately 18% of the total lysine residues were found as the cross-linking dipeptide ϵ-(γ-glutamyl) lysine. Labeled cornified envelope protein was synthesized by human epidermal keratinocytes allowed to differentiate terminally in culture. The extent of cross-linking, determined from the proportion of radioactive lysine in ϵ-(γ-glutamyl) lysine after exhaustive proteolysis, was similar to that in stratum corneum. The properties of the cornified envelopes (insolubility in detergent and reducing agents, and solubility following proteolytic digestion) are readily explained by a structure consisting of a cross-linked protein lattice."
https://openalex.org/W2036301926,"Glucose consumption of the rat suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) was studied under various experimental conditions by means of the [14C]deoxyglucose (DG) technique. The results show that glucose consumption of the SCN, in contrast to other brain structures, is a function of both the time of day and environmental lighting conditions. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the SCN have an essential role in circadian rhythm regulation and indicate that the DG technique may provide a novel approach for the study of the central neural mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2086974151,"Abstract We have used electron microscopic RNA loop mapping to determine, to within 200 nucleotides, the chromosome coordinates of the 5′ and 3′ ends of adenovirus type 2 transcripts isolated from the cytoplasm of productively infected human KB cells. The major blocks of transcription and many of the individual transcripts have discrete lengths and well defined 5′ and 3′ termini. Early cytoplasmic RNA is transcribed from four separate regions of the adenovirus genome, in map intervals 1.3–11.1, 62.4–67.9, 78.6–86.1 and 91.5–96.8. The most frequent late RNA loop occurred between coordinates 51.9 and 62.2. A late transcript complementary to interval 86.3–91.5 formed a characteristic R loop with a long branch of displaced RNA from coordinate 89.8–91.5, possibly a result of secondary structure near coordinate 89.8. Other late cytoplasmic RNA loops were located between coordinates 11.1 and 14.9, and in the intervals from 30–52 and 68–83. Transcripts from several regions of the chromosome had variable lengths but common 5′ or 3′ termini. Few R loops were seen between map coordinates 15 and 30. Switches between template strands were observed at map positions 11.2, 62.4 and 91.5. Many of the R loops have been correlated with gene products mapped previously by translation of RNA complementary to different portions of the chromosome."

Both cytosol fractions contain a 3.5S macromolecule which specifically binds 1,25-dihydroxy-[3H]vitamin D3 and in addition, a 5 to 6S macromolecule which binds 25-hydroxy-[3H]vitamin D3. In rat calvaria cytosol, 1,25-dihydroxy-[3H]vitamin D3 also binds to the 5 to 6S macromolecule but appears to have greater affinity for the 3.5S component."
https://openalex.org/W3206390335,"The available evidence on the ecological factors favoring the existence and origin of natural parthenogenesis is evaluated. Analysis of the geographical distributions of the well-known cases of animal parthenogenesis in nature reveals (i) that most of these species exist in natural disclimax communities and (ii) that within these communities they exist in isolation from closely related congeneric species. Parthenogenesis can only evolve in areas devoid of the generating bisexual species, because such species would prevent newly formed unisexuals from establishing clones due either to hybridization or competition. Furthermore, the two unique features allowing parthenogenetic species to invade and occupy open habitats faster than bisexuals are (i) a double intrinsic rate of increase and (ii) the ability of one individual to establish a new colony."

The 16 and 23S sequences in each unit are separated by a 2100 base pair (bp) spacer. The DNA sequence for 5S RNA is closely linked to that for the 23S RNA. Within the above unit, the three RNAs are transcribed from a single DNA strand. The two rDNA units on the circular chloroplast DNA molecule are separated from each other by 18,500 bp in one direction and by 106,100 bp in the other direction. The two rDNA units have an inverted orientation with respect to each other. Each rDNA unit is part of a 22,000 bp sequence which is repeated with inverted orientation."

At the same concentration, pentylenetetrazole caused less attenuation of the other iontophoretic responses and had minimal membrane effects. Several convulsants have been observed to have a similar selectivity for the chloride conductance. A common mechanism of convulsant action--reduction of transmitter-induced chloride conductances--is hypothesized."

Long-term ethanol exposure may thus induce the synthesis of more rigid membrane lipids, reducing membrane ""fluidizability."" This may provide a neurocellular basis for ethanol tolerance and cross-tolerance with anesthetics and barbiturates."
https://openalex.org/W2291411100,"Adenosine inhibits the rat liver adenylate cyclase system at a regulatory site that is distinct from the glucagon receptor, the guanine nucleotide regulatory site, and the active site involved in catalysis of ATP to cyclic AMP. The effects of the nucleoside are also independent of the concentration of uncomplexed ATP (ATP4-) in the assay medium. Glucagon, but not guanine nucleotides, sensitizes the system to inhibition by adenosine. Depending on assay conditions, the hormone can shift the concentration of adenosine required for 50% inhibition by as much as 10-fold. Under optimal conditions, the apparent Ki for adenosine is 25 micron. Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ increase adenylate cyclase activity and, in order of relative potency, increase the sensitivity of the enzyme to adenosine inhibition; Mn2+ is 50- to 100-fold more potent than Mg2+. The adenosine inhibitory site exhibits stringent structural requirements for nucleoside action. Most alterations of the purine ring result in loss of activity, whereas alterations in the ribose ring are tolerated, and some deoxyadenosine analogs are even more effective than adenosine. Naturally occurring nucleosides and nucleotides, such as inosine, guanosine, and 5'-AMP, are inactive. Analog studies reveal also that inhibition of the hepatic system occurs at a site which is clearly different from the sites through which adenosine activates other adenylate cyclase systems, and that the liver enzyme appears to have no site for activation by the nucleoside."

https://openalex.org/W1999209658,"Globin mRNA is present in proerythroblasts isolated from anemic rabbit bone marrow by unit gravity sedimentation. Its level has been quantitated in these cells and in the other cells of the erythroid lineage by RNA excess hybridization to highly labeled complementary globin DNA. Globin mRNA levels per cell remain fairly constant at about 10,000 copies per cell until cell division has stopped permanently, when this value rises to approximately 23,000. The rate of accumulation of globin mRNA in nondividing erythroblasts was found to be compatible with the accepted rates of in vivo gene transcription. We have also found evidence for the presence of a β-related globin mRNA in proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts which comprises about 50% of their total globin mRNA. It was detected by the diphasic melting curves of the hybrids between globin cDNA and RNA from these immature erythroblasts. The mismatched component melted 3°C lower than the true hybrid. It was identified as being β- rather than α-related by determining the melting temperatures of hybrids between RNA from basophilic erythroblasts and cDNA transcribed from either α- or β-globin mRNA species (separated by electrophoresis in formamide). Melting curves of hybrids between erythroblast RNA and tritiated DNA copied from rabbit β-globin plasmid DNA, donated by Dr. B. Mach, confirmed that the new globin mRNA is β-related and that it is absent in late orthochromatic erythroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2060598255,"The rise in levels of aldomet in the brains of rats after an injection of the alpha-methylated amino acid was depressed when large neutral amino acids, but not acidic amino acids, were coadministered with the drug. This result suggests that aldomet is transported into brain by the carrier for natural large neutral amino acids. The prior ingestion of a carbohydrate meal, which lowers levels of neural amino acids in the serum, enhanced the uptake of aldomet into brain; the consumption of a protein-containing meal inhibited the subsequent uptake of aldomet into the brain. Antecedent diet can thus affect the availability of aldomet to the central nervous system; the mechanism of this effect probably involves the blood-brain barrier uptake system for large neutral amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2067856934,"An entorhinal cortical lesion causes undamaged fibers in the deafferented hippocampus to sprout and form new connections within 4 to 7 days after the lesion was made. When a partial lesion of the entorhinal cortex precedes a second, more complete entorhinal lesion by a few days, the rate of axon sprouting is accelerated so that the response to the second lesion occurs within only 2 days. This priming effect is present within 4 days, lasts for a few weeks, and eventually subsides. This acceleration may explain, in part, the faster recovery and reduced deficits seen in behavioral studies that have followed serial lesion paradigms."

https://openalex.org/W2046231396,"The physical properties, including contour length, buoyant density and Tm, of chloroplast DNA isolated from purified mesophyll (MC) and bundle sheath chloroplasts (BSC) of a C4 plant are identical. DNA renaturation measurements indicate that both DNAs have a complexity of 9.1 × 107 daltons. BSC and MC chloroplast are homologous as measured using 203Hg-labeled DNA hybridized as a tracer with an excess of the second DNA type, retention of heteroduplexes on a sulfhydryl affinity column and testing for mismatch by measuring the release of 203Hg-C after digestion with S1 single-strand-specific nuclease. The Sal restriction endonuclease patterns determined by electron microscopic measurement of DNA fragment lengths of the two DNA types are identical. The only detectable difference between the two chloroplasts is the DNA content: bundle sheath chloroplasts contain approximately 50 copies of the genome as opposed to 20 in mesophyll chloroplasts. Chloroplasts DNAs from the C4 plant share approximately 95% homology with the chloroplast DNA of a C3 (Calvin cycle pathway) plant of the same genus. Thus the significant differences in physiology and morphology between mesophyll and bundle sheath chloroplasts of C4 plants and between the plastids of C3 and C4 plants are not due to major differences in the genetic complement of mature plastids."

https://openalex.org/W1558525387,"Chromatin subunits or nucleosomes prepared by micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei from trout testis have been examined for the presence of in vivo modified histone species. Both monomers and multimers are labeled when testis cells are incubated in the presence of [14C]acetate, but the level of radioactivity in the monomer fraction is 10 to 20% higher than in the multimer fraction. This difference is attributed to the trimming of nucleotides from the monomer DNA, associated with the loss of H1. The specific activities of the [14C]acetate label in histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 in monomer particles are similar to their respective values in whole chromatin. Starch gel electrophoresis of histone fractions derived from monomeric nucleosomes revealed the presence of monoacetylated and phosphorylated species of H2A, monoacetylated species of H2B and H3, and mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraacetylated species of H4. No differences in the content of these species between monomeric nucleosomes and whole chromatin could be discerned."

Similar experiments carried out at 6.7 atmospheres of inert gas and 0.3 atmosphere of oxygen produced more bubbles for as long as 12 hours after the gas switch. This is believed to be the first objective demonstration of the phenomenon of deep isobaric supersaturation under transient operational diving conditions at relatively shallow diving depths. Detection of bubbles by Doppler ultrasound confirms the potential importance of the phenomenon to shallow saturation diving and holds promise for better quantitification of its effects as well as those of its counterpart, isobaric undersaturation, which can confer a decompression advantage."
