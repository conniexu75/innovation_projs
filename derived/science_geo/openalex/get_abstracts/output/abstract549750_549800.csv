https://openalex.org/W2224398381,"CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing but can induce unwanted off-target mutations. Existing strategies for reducing genome-wide off-target effects of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) are imperfect, possessing only partial or unproven efficacies and other limitations that constrain their use. Here we describe SpCas9-HF1, a high-fidelity variant harbouring alterations designed to reduce non-specific DNA contacts. SpCas9-HF1 retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type SpCas9 with >85% of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested in human cells. Notably, with sgRNAs targeted to standard non-repetitive sequences, SpCas9-HF1 rendered all or nearly all off-target events undetectable by genome-wide break capture and targeted sequencing methods. Even for atypical, repetitive target sites, the vast majority of off-target mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 were not detected with SpCas9-HF1. With its exceptional precision, SpCas9-HF1 provides an alternative to wild-type SpCas9 for research and therapeutic applications. More broadly, our results suggest a general strategy for optimizing genome-wide specificities of other CRISPR-RNA-guided nucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2174781702,"In the vertebrate visual system, all output of the retina is carried by retinal ganglion cells. Each type encodes distinct visual features in parallel for transmission to the brain. How many such ‘output channels’ exist and what each encodes are areas of intense debate. In the mouse, anatomical estimates range from 15 to 20 channels, and only a handful are functionally understood. By combining two-photon calcium imaging to obtain dense retinal recordings and unsupervised clustering of the resulting sample of more than 11,000 cells, here we show that the mouse retina harbours substantially more than 30 functional output channels. These include all known and several new ganglion cell types, as verified by genetic and anatomical criteria. Therefore, information channels from the mouse eye to the mouse brain are considerably more diverse than shown thus far by anatomical studies, suggesting an encoding strategy resembling that used in state-of-the-art artificial vision systems. Two-photon calcium imaging reveals that the mouse retina contains more than 30 functionally distinct retinal ganglion cells, including some that have not been described before, exceeding current estimates and suggesting that the functional diversity of retinal ganglion cells may be much larger than previously thought. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey visual information from the retina to the brain. How many types of RGC exist and how they should be classified have been long-standing questions. Thomas Euler and colleagues used two-photon calcium imaging to record responses to stimuli in more than 11,000 cells in a patch of the mouse ganglion cell layer, and applied unsupervised clustering of the resulting data. This revealed that the mouse retina harbours more than 30 distinct functional RGC types, including several that have not been described before. This number substantially exceeds current estimates and indicates that the functional diversity of RGCs is greater than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2226721679,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous and clinically aggressive disease for which there is no targeted therapy. BET bromodomain inhibitors, which have shown efficacy in several models of cancer, have not been evaluated in TNBC. These inhibitors displace BET bromodomain proteins such as BRD4 from chromatin by competing with their acetyl-lysine recognition modules, leading to inhibition of oncogenic transcriptional programs. Here we report the preferential sensitivity of TNBCs to BET bromodomain inhibition in vitro and in vivo, establishing a rationale for clinical investigation and further motivation to understand mechanisms of resistance. In paired cell lines selected for acquired resistance to BET inhibition from previously sensitive TNBCs, we failed to identify gatekeeper mutations, new driver events or drug pump activation. BET-resistant TNBC cells remain dependent on wild-type BRD4, which supports transcription and cell proliferation in a bromodomain-independent manner. Proteomic studies of resistant TNBC identify strong association with MED1 and hyper-phosphorylation of BRD4 attributable to decreased activity of PP2A, identified here as a principal BRD4 serine phosphatase. Together, these studies provide a rationale for BET inhibition in TNBC and present mechanism-based combination strategies to anticipate clinical drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2237013884,"Endothelial cells (ECs) are plastic cells that can switch between growth states with different bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements. Although quiescent in most healthy tissues, ECs divide and migrate rapidly upon proangiogenic stimulation. Adjusting endothelial metabolism to the growth state is central to normal vessel growth and function, yet it is poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report that the forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO1 is an essential regulator of vascular growth that couples metabolic and proliferative activities in ECs. Endothelial-restricted deletion of FOXO1 in mice induces a profound increase in EC proliferation that interferes with coordinated sprouting, thereby causing hyperplasia and vessel enlargement. Conversely, forced expression of FOXO1 restricts vascular expansion and leads to vessel thinning and hypobranching. We find that FOXO1 acts as a gatekeeper of endothelial quiescence, which decelerates metabolic activity by reducing glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, FOXO1 suppresses signalling by MYC (also known as c-MYC), a powerful driver of anabolic metabolism and growth. MYC ablation impairs glycolysis, mitochondrial function and proliferation of ECs while its EC-specific overexpression fuels these processes. Moreover, restoration of MYC signalling in FOXO1-overexpressing endothelium normalizes metabolic activity and branching behaviour. Our findings identify FOXO1 as a critical rheostat of vascular expansion and define the FOXO1-MYC transcriptional network as a novel metabolic checkpoint during endothelial growth and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2232549736,"Adoptive transfer of receptor-engineered T cells has produced impressive results in treating patients with B cell leukemias and lymphomas. This success has captured public imagination and driven academic and industrial researchers to develop similar 'off-the-shelf' receptors targeting shared antigens on epithelial cancers, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. However, the successful treatment of large numbers of people with solid cancers using this strategy is unlikely to be straightforward. Receptor-engineered T cells have the potential to cause lethal toxicity from on-target recognition of normal tissues, and there is a paucity of truly tumor-specific antigens shared across tumor types. Here we offer our perspective on how expanding the use of genetically redirected T cells to treat the majority of patients with solid cancers will require major technical, manufacturing and regulatory innovations centered around the development of autologous gene therapies targeting private somatic mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2238302853,"Catalysis in biology is restricted to RNA (ribozymes) and protein enzymes, but synthetic biomolecular catalysts can also be made of DNA (deoxyribozymes) or synthetic genetic polymers. In vitro selection from synthetic random DNA libraries identified DNA catalysts for various chemical reactions beyond RNA backbone cleavage. DNA-catalysed reactions include RNA and DNA ligation in various topologies, hydrolytic cleavage and photorepair of DNA, as well as reactions of peptides and small molecules. In spite of comprehensive biochemical studies of DNA catalysts for two decades, fundamental mechanistic understanding of their function is lacking in the absence of three-dimensional models at atomic resolution. Early attempts to solve the crystal structure of an RNA-cleaving deoxyribozyme resulted in a catalytically irrelevant nucleic acid fold. Here we report the crystal structure of the RNA-ligating deoxyribozyme 9DB1 (ref. 14) at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure captures the ligation reaction in the post-catalytic state, revealing a compact folding unit stabilized by numerous tertiary interactions, and an unanticipated organization of the catalytic centre. Structure-guided mutagenesis provided insights into the basis for regioselectivity of the ligation reaction and allowed remarkable manipulation of substrate recognition and reaction rate. Moreover, the structure highlights how the specific properties of deoxyribose are reflected in the backbone conformation of the DNA catalyst, in support of its intricate three-dimensional organization. The structural principles underlying the catalytic ability of DNA elucidate differences and similarities in DNA versus RNA catalysts, which is relevant for comprehending the privileged position of folded RNA in the prebiotic world and in current organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2229966019,"Mechanisms that maintain cancer stem cells are crucial to tumour progression. The ID2 protein supports cancer hallmarks including the cancer stem cell state. HIFα transcription factors, most notably HIF2α (also known as EPAS1), are expressed in and required for maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the pathways that are engaged by ID2 or drive HIF2α accumulation in CSCs have remained unclear. Here we report that DYRK1A and DYRK1B kinases phosphorylate ID2 on threonine 27 (Thr27). Hypoxia downregulates this phosphorylation via inactivation of DYRK1A and DYRK1B. The activity of these kinases is stimulated in normoxia by the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase PHD1 (also known as EGLN2). ID2 binds to the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, displaces VHL-associated Cullin 2, and impairs HIF2α ubiquitylation and degradation. Phosphorylation of Thr27 of ID2 by DYRK1 blocks ID2–VHL interaction and preserves HIF2α ubiquitylation. In glioblastoma, ID2 positively modulates HIF2α activity. Conversely, elevated expression of DYRK1 phosphorylates Thr27 of ID2, leading to HIF2α destabilization, loss of glioma stemness, inhibition of tumour growth, and a more favourable outcome for patients with glioblastoma. HIFα transcription factors are highly expressed in cancer stem cells from glioma; DYRK1 kinases inhibit the protein ID2 to modulate the level of HIF2α and the tumorigenic properties of glioblastoma-associated cancer stem cells. How cancer stem cells are regulated to drive tumour progression is unclear. ID2 proteins and hypoxia induced factors (HIF) are highly expressed in cancer stem cells from glioma. Antonio Iavarone and colleagues show here that DYRK1 kinases regulate ID2 to modulate the level of HIF2 and the tumorigenic properties of glioblastoma-associated cancer cells via an interaction with the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex. This finding indicates a possible therapeutic route to interfere with the activity of these cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2231816712,"The complexity of shoulder mechanics combined with the movement of skin relative to the scapula makes it difficult to measure shoulder kinematics with sufficient accuracy to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Multibody skeletal models can improve motion capture accuracy by reducing the space of possible joint movements, and models are used widely to improve measurement of lower limb kinematics. In this study, we developed a rigid-body model of a scapulothoracic joint to describe the kinematics of the scapula relative to the thorax. This model describes scapular kinematics with four degrees of freedom: 1) elevation and 2) abduction of the scapula on an ellipsoidal thoracic surface, 3) upward rotation of the scapula normal to the thoracic surface, and 4) internal rotation of the scapula to lift the medial border of the scapula off the surface of the thorax. The surface dimensions and joint axes can be customized to match an individual's anthropometry. We compared the model to gold standard bone-pin kinematics collected during three shoulder tasks and found modeled scapular kinematics to be accurate to within 2 mm root-mean-squared error for individual bone-pin markers across all markers and movement tasks. As an additional test, we added random and systematic noise to the bone-pin marker data and found that the model reduced kinematic variability due to noise by 65% compared to Euler angles computed without the model. Our scapulothoracic joint model can be used for inverse and forward dynamics analyses and to compute joint reaction loads. The computational performance of the scapulothoracic joint model is well suited for real-time applications; it is freely available for use with OpenSim 3.2, and is customizable and usable with other OpenSim models."
https://openalex.org/W2273769037,"Inhibiting class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) increases energy expenditure, reduces adiposity, and improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice. However, the precise mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that HDAC1 is a negative regulator of the brown adipocyte thermogenic program. The Hdac1 level is lower in mouse brown fat (BAT) than white fat, is suppressed in mouse BAT during cold exposure or β3-adrenergic stimulation, and is down-regulated during brown adipocyte differentiation. Remarkably, overexpressing Hdac1 profoundly blocks, whereas deleting Hdac1 significantly enhances, β-adrenergic activation-induced BAT-specific gene expression in brown adipocytes. β-Adrenergic activation in brown adipocytes results in a dissociation of HDAC1 from promoters of BAT-specific genes, including uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α (Pgc1α), leading to increased acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), an epigenetic mark of gene activation. This is followed by dissociation of the polycomb repressive complexes, including the H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homologue (EZH2), suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), and ring finger protein 2 (RNF2) from (and concomitant recruitment of H3K27 demethylase ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat on chromosome X (UTX) to) Ucp1 and Pgc1α promoters, leading to decreased H3K27 trimethylation, a histone transcriptional repression mark. Thus, HDAC1 negatively regulates the brown adipocyte thermogenic program, and inhibiting Hdac1 promotes BAT-specific gene expression through a coordinated control of increased acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27, thereby switching the transcriptional repressive state to the active state at the promoters of Ucp1 and Pgc1α. Targeting HDAC1 may be beneficial in prevention and treatment of obesity by enhancing BAT thermogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2223462690,"A mosaic of intact native and human-modified vegetation use can provide important habitat for top predators such as the puma (Puma concolor), avoiding negative effects on other species and ecological processes due to cascade trophic interactions. This study investigates the effects of restoration scenarios on the puma's habitat suitability in the most developed Brazilian region (São Paulo State). Species Distribution Models incorporating restoration scenarios were developed using the species' occurrence information to (1) map habitat suitability of pumas in São Paulo State, Southeast, Brazil; (2) test the relative contribution of environmental variables ecologically relevant to the species habitat suitability and (3) project the predicted habitat suitability to future native vegetation restoration scenarios. The Maximum Entropy algorithm was used (Test AUC of 0.84 ± 0.0228) based on seven environmental non-correlated variables and non-autocorrelated presence-only records (n = 342). The percentage of native vegetation (positive influence), elevation (positive influence) and density of roads (negative influence) were considered the most important environmental variables to the model. Model projections to restoration scenarios reflected the high positive relationship between pumas and native vegetation. These projections identified new high suitability areas for pumas (probability of presence >0.5) in highly deforested regions. High suitability areas were increased from 5.3% to 8.5% of the total State extension when the landscapes were restored for ≥ the minimum native vegetation cover rule (20%) established by the Brazilian Forest Code in private lands. This study highlights the importance of a landscape planning approach to improve the conservation outlook for pumas and other species, including not only the establishment and management of protected areas, but also the habitat restoration on private lands. Importantly, the results may inform environmental policies and land use planning in São Paulo State, Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2232961728,"The well known biomarker of oxidative stress, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, is more susceptible to further oxidation than the parent guanine base and can be oxidatively transformed to the genotoxic spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) and 5-guanidinohydantoin (Gh) lesions. Incubation of 135-mer duplexes with single Sp or Gh lesions in human cell extracts yields a characteristic nucleotide excision repair (NER)-induced ladder of short dual incision oligonucleotide fragments in addition to base excision repair (BER) incision products. The ladders were not observed when NER was inhibited either by mouse monoclonal antibody (5F12) to human XPA or in XPC(-/-) fibroblast cell extracts. However, normal NER activity appeared when the XPC(-/-) cell extracts were complemented with XPC-RAD23B proteins. The Sp and Gh lesions are excellent substrates of both BER and NER. In contrast, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole, a product of the oxidation of guanine in DNA by peroxynitrite, is an excellent substrate of BER only. In the case of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, BER of the Sp lesion is strongly reduced in NEIL1(-/-) relative to NEIL1(+/+) extracts. In summary, in human cell extracts, BER and NER activities co-exist and excise Gh and Sp DNA lesions, suggesting that the relative NER/BER product ratios may depend on competitive BER and NER protein binding to these lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2229325570,"Climate change will bring more drought periods that will have an impact on the irrigation practices of some crops like tomato, from standard water regime to deficit irrigation. This will promote changes in plant metabolism and alter their interactions with biotic stressors. We have tested if mild or moderate drought-stressed tomato plants (simulating deficit irrigation) have an effect on the biological traits of the invasive tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi. Our data reveal that T evansi caused more leaf damage to drought-stressed tomato plants (≥1.5 fold for both drought scenarios). Mite performance was also enhanced, as revealed by significant increases of eggs laid (≥2 fold) at 4 days post infestation (dpi), and of mobile forms (≥2 fold and 1.5 fold for moderate and mild drought, respectively) at 10 dpi. The levels of several essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, valine) and free sugars in tomato leaves were significantly induced by drought in combination with mites. The non-essential amino acid proline was also strongly induced, stimulating mite feeding and egg laying when added to tomato leaf disks at levels equivalent to that estimated on drought-infested tomato plants at 10 dpi. Tomato plant defense proteins were also affected by drought and/or mite infestation, but T. evansi was capable of circumventing their potential adverse effects. Altogether, our data indicate that significant increases of available free sugars and essential amino acids, jointly with their phagostimulant effect, created a favorable environment for a better T. evansi performance on drought-stressed tomato leaves. Thus, drought-stressed tomato plants, even at mild levels, may be more prone to T evansi outbreaks in a climate change scenario, which might negatively affect tomato production on area-wide scales."

SEEL can circumvent many of the possible issues associated with metabolic labeling, including low incorporation of sugar precursors, and allows for sugars to be added selectively to different types of glycans by virtue of the inherent specificity of the glycosyltransferases. Here we compare the labeling of sialoglycoproteins in undifferentiated and differentiated human erythroleukemia cells (HEL) using SEEL using the sialyltransferases ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal1, which label N- and O-glycans, respectively. Our results show that the profile of glycoproteins detected varies between undifferentiated HEL cells and those differentiated to megakaryocytes, with a shift to more N-linked sialoglycoproteins in the differentiated cells. The efficiency of SEEL for both sialyltransferases in HEL cells was greatly increased with prior neuraminidase treatment highlighting the necessity for the presence of available acceptors with this labeling method. Following metabolic labeling or SEEL, tagged glycoproteins were enriched by immunoprecipitation and identified using mass spectrometry. The proteomic findings demonstrated that the detection of many glycoproteins is markedly improved by SEEL labeling, and that unique glycoproteins can be identified using either ST6Gal1 or ST3Gal1.

Most methodologies utilize metabolic labeling as a way to incorporate functionalized sugars into glycans during biosynthesis. The extent of labeling in some cell types may be limited by the presence of endogenous non-labeled sugar precursors that can dilute out the azide-sugars available for incorporation. Variable distribution of azide-sugars into different glycan classes (e.g. glycoproteins versus glycolipids) following metabolic labeling can also skew or limit the types of glycans that can be analyzed. As an alternative approach, labeling methods have been developed that instead rely on the use of recombinant or purified glycosyltransferases to install functionalized sugars directly onto existing glycans (10Mbua N.E.

Prior work using the sialyltransferase ST6Gal1 demonstrated that only N-glycans were modified, confirming the established selectivity of this enzyme (10Mbua N.E. Li X. Flanagan-Steet H.R. Meng L.

Because of the more selective nature of SEEL-based labeling, we propose that this method would allow glycoproteins bearing specific types of glycans to be enriched and identified by proteomic analysis. Such an approach would provide an advantageous and complementary way to identify glycoproteins whose glycosylation is sensitive in the context of human diseases or upon differentiation to various cell lineages. By virtue of the fact that neither the glycosyltransferases nor the modified nucleotide-sugars are capable of crossing the plasma membrane, only cell surface glycoproteins will be labeled by SEEL thus reducing the background typically associated with traditional methods of surface labeling. In the present study, we used SEEL with two different sialyltransferases in undifferentiated and differentiated human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. We demonstrate that labeling with different sialyltransferases produces distinct profiles of sialoglycoproteins in HEL cells, and that SEEL facilitates the detection of glycoproteins that are not readily visualized by metabolic labeling. Moreover, we demonstrated that neuraminidase-coupled SEEL with the two different sialyltransferases improves the overall coverage and detection of sialoglycoproteins by mass spectrometry. An increase in cell surface expression of several adhesion proteins known to be markers of megakaryocytic differentiation was faithfully identified within the differentiated HEL cells using this approach. The potential of SEEL and neuraminidase-coupled SEEL to analyze the sialylation status and cell surface expression of sialoglycoproteins, respectively, is discussed.

PNGaseF and glycoprotein denaturatuion buffer was from Biolabs (P0704S). Mouse monoclonal anti-Biotin antibodies (200-032-211, HRP-conjugated from or 200-002-211, non-conjugated form) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. HRP-conjugated β-actin antibody was from Abcam. Protease inhibitor mixture tablet (88666) and mass spectrometry compatible silver staining kit (24600) were from Thermo Scientific. Protein G beads were from Sigma Aldrich (Protein G-Sepharose, Fast Flow, P3296). Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells were cultured in RPMI1640 media with l-glutamine (2.0 mm). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Clone K1, ATCC) and mutant CHO cells (Lec2) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Alpha 1X (Cellgro) with Earle's salts, without ribonucleosides, deoxyribonucleosides, and l-glutamine. All medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, BenchMark) and penicillin (100 IU/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml, MediaTech). Cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, 37 °C humid incubator. Typically, HEL cells (0.8∼0.9 × 106 cells/well) in a 6-well dish were treated with 16 nm PMA for 48 h. After removing the media together with floating cells, fresh medium containing 8 nm PMA was added, and cells were further cultured for 24 h. For metabolic labeling, the differentiated HEL cells were cultured with Ac4ManNAz (30 μm) in the presence of 8 nm PMA for additional 24 h. At the same time, cells for SEEL labeling were cultured in the presence of 8 nm PMA for additional 24 h without Ac4ManNAz. HEL cells (normal or differentiated) were collected in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Note that the differentiated HEL cells are adherent but they are easily lifted off by pipetting. After washing the cells with DPBS, cells were briefly centrifuged and then the resulting pellet was resuspended and incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 media with or without Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (50 mU/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C with rocking. Next, the resulting cells were washed with DPBS (1 ml × three times), and then the resulting pellet was re-suspended in SEEL reaction solution (typically 300 μl) containing 100 μg of sialyltransferase, CMP-Neu5Ac9N3, (100 μm unless otherwise noted), 2 μl of BSA (2 mg/ml), 2 μl of alkaline phosphatase, 46 μl of 3 m sucrose in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and then cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with rocking. Based on earlier work, SEEL reaction can be performed across a range of concentration of CMP-Neu5Ac9N3 (50∼500 μm) without noticeable decreases in labeling. However, 100 μm CMP-Neu5Ac9N3 was found to be sufficient for maximal labeling with a defined concentration of sialyltransferase (100 μg in 300 μl reaction). Percent cell viability following the various steps in the SEEL procedure was determined as triplicate. Briefly, portions of HEL cells from SEEL reactions with ST6Gal1 in three Eppendorf tubes were collected over the course of SEEL reaction, 1) before sialidase treatment, 2) after sialidase treatment, 3) after ST6Gal1 and Neu5Ac9N3 reaction, 4) after S-DIBO-biotin treatment, and their viability was measured by Cellometer® Vision (Nexcelom Bioscience) using Trypan Blue exclusion method (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Neuraminidase treatment and SEEL of CHO or Lec2 cells were conducted in 12 well dishes. After the cells were confluent, cells were washed with DPBS (1 ml × two times) and then serum-free α-MEM (0.5 ml) was added to each well with or without V. cholerae neuraminidase (50 mU/ml). After incubating the dishes at 37 °C for 2 h, cells were washed with DPBS (1 ml × three times for each well), and then SEEL reaction solution (300 μl each) containing 100 μg of sialyltransferase, CMP-Neu5Ac9N3, (142 μm), BSA (2 mg/ml), 2 μl of alkaline phosphatase, 46 μl of 3 m sucrose in serum-free α-MEM, and then cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C without rocking. Cells metabolically labeled by Ac4ManNAz or SEEL were biotinylated with S-DIBO-biotin. Typically, 30 μm S-DIBO in DPBS containing 2% FBS was treated to cells either in Eppendorf tube (HEL cells) or 12-well dish (CHO or Lec2 cells) for 1 h at room temperature. Biotin-labeled cells were washed with DPBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific) on ice. After 30 min, lysates were spun down at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was saved. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Science Pierce) by following the manufacturer's protocol. Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using anti-biotin antibody conjugated with HRP. In the case of treating lysate with PNGase F, cell lysate was denatured by boiling for 10 min with the supplementation of glycoproteins denaturation buffer. Then the denatured lysate was incubated with 10 units of PNGase F at 37 °C for 4 h. Next, the PNGase F-treated lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using anti-biotin antibody conjugated with HRP. For immunoprecipitation, anti-biotin-coated protein G beads (Sigma) were prepared by incubating anti-biotin antibody with protein G beads in the RIPA buffer followed by washing with the same buffer. 3∼4 mg of the lysates were precleared by incubating with protein G beads for 2 h at 4 °C and then spun down. The precleared lysate as supernatant was collected and then incubated with the antibody-coated protein G beads overnight at 4 °C. Next, the beads were washed five times with the RIPA buffer and then eluted with 2× sample loading buffer containing 10 mm DTT by boiling for 7 min. Eluted sample was separated in SDS-PAGE, and the gel was silver stained. Silver staining of the resulting gel was done with a mass spectrometry compatible silver staining kit from Thermo Scientific following the manufacturer's protocol. Each lane of the silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel was cut into 4 parts above 50 kDa and subsequently processed for in-gel digestion. Briefly, destained gel bands were denatured by incubating with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 1 h and alkylated by 55 mm iodoacetamide for 45 min in dark prior to digestion with trypsin overnight. The resulting peptides were extracted, dried, and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid. The peptides were separated on a 75 μm (I.D.) × 15 cm C18 capillary column (packed inhouse, YMC GEL ODS-AQ120ÅS-5, Waters) and eluted into the nano-electrospray ion source of an Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 180-min linear gradient consisting of 0.5–100% solvent B over 150 min at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. The spray voltage was set to 2.2 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 280 °C. Full MS scans were acquired from m/z 300 to 2000 at 120k resolution, and MS2 scans following collision-induced fragmentation were collected in the ion trap for the most intense ions in the Top-Speed mode within a 3-s cycle using Fusion instrument software (v1.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The raw spectra were searched against the human protein database (UniProt, Oct. 2014) using SEQUEST (Proteome Discoverer 1.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with full MS peptide tolerance of 20 ppm and MS2 peptide fragment tolerance of 0.5 Da, and filtered using ProteoIQ (v2.7, Premier Biosoft) at the protein level to generate a 1% false discovery rate for protein assignments. UniProt was used to define cellular localization. Quantification was performed using spectral counts generated in ProteoIQ (v2.7, Premier Biosoft). Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells grown in suspension can be differentiated to adherent megakaryocytes by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, providing an opportunity to analyze how the profile of sialoglycoproteins changes upon differentiation with various labeling methods (13Barnes J.

Metabolic labeling of HEL cells with Ac4ManNAz showed predominantly O-sialoglycoproteins being labeled as demonstrated by the insensitivity of labeled glycoproteins to PNGase F treatment (Fig. 1). In contrast, PMA-derived differentiated HEL cells showed significantly increased N-sialoglycoprotein labeling as evidenced by an increase in specific bands (e.g. 80 kDa) and the subsequent disappearance of these bands following enzymatic removal of the N-glycans. A corresponding decrease in the major labeled O-sialoglycoprotein was also observed upon differentiation. Incubation of the cells with ManNAc resulted in no glycoprotein labeling as expected. Next, HEL cells were either incubated with Ac4ManNAz for 24 h, or SEEL labeled with rat ST6Gal1 or human ST3Gal1 in the presence of CMP-Neu5Ac9N3 followed by treatment with S-DIBO for biotinylation (Fig. 2). S-DIBO was chosen since it does not cross the plasma membrane and therefore avoids conjugation with intracellular glycoproteins (16Friscourt F. Ledin P.A. Mbua N.E. Flanagan-Steet H.R. Wolfert M.A. Steet R. Boons G.J. Polar dibenzocyclooctynes for selective labeling of extracellular glycoconjugates of living cells.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134: 5381-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast to metabolically labeled cells, Western blot analysis with anti-biotin antibody showed only weak labeling following SEEL with either sialyltransferase. Increasing enzyme or nucleotide-sugar concentrations did not increase labeling, suggesting that HEL cells are heavily sialylated and lack available acceptors. To enhance SEEL, HEL cells were incubated with a bacterial neuraminidase (from Vibrio cholera) prior to SEEL reaction with ST6Gal1 or ST3Gal1. Immunoblotting of the resulting cell lysate showed dramatically enhanced SEEL sialylation of cell surface glycoproteins (Fig. 2a). These data demonstrate the importance of available acceptors as a prerequisite for SEEL labeling. All treatments resulted in only minimal effects on cell viability under the optimized conditions used (Fig. 2b). We also show that untreated WT CHO cells are poorly labeled by SEEL but that robust labeling can be achieved with both ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal1 following neuraminidase pre-treatment (Fig. 3). Lec2 cells, which bear a defect in the CMP-sialic acid transporter, showed strong SEEL labeling regardless of pre-treatment of neuraminidase due to the loss of any sialic acid incorporation in these cells.FIGURE 3.Neu-SEEL labeling of WT CHO and Lec2 cells. Western blot analysis of WT and Lec2 CHO cells following ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal1 SEEL (with or without prior neuraminidase treatment) is shown. The image depicted is representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specificity of the respective sialyltransferases was confirmed by treating SEEL-labeled lysates with PNGaseF prior to analysis. Glycoproteins labeled by ST6Gal1 completely disappeared upon treatment of PNGase F while glycoproteins labeled by ST3Gal1 were largely insensitive (Fig. 4). Among the glycoproteins labeled by ST3Gal1, some shifted to lower molecular weight range, presumably because they also bear N-glycans, but the intensity of labeling did not decrease. This finding is in good agreement with the known specificities of these two glycosyltransferases (17Kiwamoto T. Brummet M.E. Wu F. Motari M.G. Smith D.F. Schnaar R.L. Zhu Z. Bochner B.S.

We next optimized an enrichment protocol for biotin-tagged glycoproteins using immunoprecipitation with an anti-biotin antibody and linked this enrichment to silver staining and proteomic analysis (Fig. 5a). For optimal pull-down of biotinylated proteins, we chose to use immunoprecipitation with anti-biotin antibody, which exhibits a minimal level of nonspecific interactions compared with streptavidin- or avidin-coated beads. Following labeling of sialoglycoproteins metabolically with ManNAz, or by neuraminidase-coupled SEEL with either ST6Gal1 or ST3Gal1, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using the anti-biotin antibody and bound sialoglycoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 5b). Parallel analysis of unlabeled HEL cells was performed as a control for nonspecific binding to the agarose beads. In-gel digestion was performed and the digested peptides corresponding to each section were analyzed by LC-MS-MS. The results were quantified and a comparison of labeled glycoproteins presented (Fig. 5c, supplemental File S1). Overall, labeling with SEEL was more efficient than metabolic labeling for the identification of sialoglycoproteins. Out of 111 identified glycoproteins, 103 proteins were identified via SEEL while 75 proteins were identified via metabolic labeling. To eliminate nonspecific hits in MS analysis, common proteins that were pulled down in the control, proteins with spectral counts under 10 and nucleocytoplasmic proteins were not included. We observed selectivity when comparing the two SEEL enzymes. Out of total 103 protein assignments from the SEEL samples, 64 proteins were identified only from the ST6Gal1 SEEL sample, while 11 proteins were only assigned from the ST3Gal1 SEEL sample. The other 66 proteins were found in both SEEL samples, suggesting they have both N- and O-sialylation. To compare the relative abundance of each protein hit, spectral counts were compared for the 103 proteins (Fig. 6). In nearly all cases, spectral counts were significantly higher in the SEEL sample compared with those from metabolic labeling. Major sialoglycoprotein hits identified were PTPRC (CD45), integrin β1, PECAM1, aminopeptidase N, plexin-D1, sialophorin (SPN, CD43), integrin β3, CD44, etc. Among them, proteins such as ITGB1, PECAM1 showed relatively higher spectral counts from the ST6Gal1 SEEL than spectral counts from ST3Gal1 SEEL, suggesting they are more highly N-sialylated than they are O-sialylated. SPN showed the highest spectral counts in the ST3Gal1 SEEL sample but relatively less spectral counts from ST6Gal1 SEEL sample, suggesting this protein has more O-sialoglycans than N-sialoglycans. This might be expected in light of the abundance of sialylated O-glycans on this protein (19Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Leukosialin, a major sialoglycoprotein on human leukocytes as differentiation antigens.Med. Biol. 1986; 64: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar, 20Maemura K. Fukuda M. Poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycans attached to leukosialin. The presence of sialyl Le(x) structures in O-glycans.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24379-24386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the ability of SEEL to identify a distinct subset of glycoproteins is consistent with what was observed in the Western blot experiments above where specific glycoproteins were detected much more readily following SEEL. Finally, we compared undifferentiated and differentiated HEL cells with neuraminidase-coupled SEEL followed by proteomic analysis to see if SEEL can be used to identify changes in cell surface sialoglycoprotein expression in these two different cell types (supplemental File S1). Interestingly, we found that the most abundant sialoglycoproteins such as PTPRC and SPN did not show any significant change upon differentiation when SEEL was performed with ST6Gal1 or ST3Gal1. In contrast, clear increases in several other proteins were specifically detected in the differentiated cells using both ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal1 (Fig. 7). Many of these glycoproteins such as integrinβ3 and CD44 are known cell adhesion proteins and megakaryocytic markers that facilitate attachment of the adherent megakaryocytes (21Hagiwara T.

J. 1995; 309: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Notably, the spectral counts of these glycoproteins far exceeded the level observed in the control cells whereas other proteins (HSP5a) could not be distinguished between control and SEEL-tagged lysates. This demonstrates the superior enrichment of glycoproteins that can be achieved using SEEL. While the integrins were primarily enriched by SEEL with ST6Gal1, other glycoproteins such as CD44 and SPN were primarily enriched using ST3Gal1, again highlighting the selectivity of the SEEL approach and its ability to enrich unique subsets of cell surface glycoproteins. The present work extends the utility of the previously reported SEEL methodology by demonstrating the selectivity of a different SEEL enzyme (ST3Gal1) and showing that SEEL-tagged glycoproteins can be effectively enriched and identified by proteomic analysis. This work further provides a comparison of SEEL and metabolic labeling in a single cell system, revealing many consistent features between the two methods. For example, an increase in the presence of certain N-sialoglycoproteins could be detected following differentiation using both labeling methods (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 4.). However, several noteworthy differences between these two approaches were also identified and are considered below. Neuraminidase-coupled SEEL with ST6Gal1 in undifferentiated HEL cells revealed a high level of N-glycan labeling, while metabolic labeling incorporated almost exclusively into O-glycans (Fig. 1, lane 5 versus Fig. 2, lane 3). Likewise, SEEL with ST3Gal1 also showed greater labeling of O-glycan while metabolic labeling showed significantly decreased O-glycan upon differentiation (Fig. 1, lane 7 versus Fig. 2, lane 10). We interpret the relative decrease in O-glycan tagging in the metabolically labeled differentiated HEL cells to reflect competition for common sialic acid precursors when the expression of N-sialoglycoproteins is increased. Metabolic labeling is influenced by the rate of glycoprotein biosynthesis and the rate of incorporation into these glycoproteins, which is often limited by competition with endogenous sugar precursor pools. Also, percentage of substitution of sialic acid into azide-tagged sialic acid varies among different cell lines (24Chang P.V. Chen X. Smyrniotis C. Xenakis A. Hu T. Bertozzi C.R. Wu P. Metabolic labeling of sialic acids in living animals with alkynyl sugars.Angewandte Chemie. 2009; 48: 4030-4033Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25Luchansky S.J. Argade S. Hayes B.K. Bertozzi C.R. Metabolic functionalization of recombinant glycoproteins.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since SEEL does not rely on the biosynthetic machinery of the cell nor does it require new synthesis of glycoproteins, competition for substrates and differences in metabolic flux do not contribute to the incorporation of the modified NeuAc derivative. Thus, this approach provides an opportunity to more accurately survey the profile of cell surface glycoproteins. This is supported by the fact that SEEL with ST3Gal1 showed an increase (not the decrease noted with ManNAz labeling) in the labeling of O-sialoglycoproteins upon differentiation (FIGURE 2., FIGURE 4.). Furthermore, SEEL is capable of labeling glycoproteins with slow turnover. This advantage may be most relevant when analyzing cell adhesion glycoproteins or extracellular matrix proteins that are subject to slow internalization and turnover since they maintain stable interactions with other proteins outside the cell. A few ER proteins, including oligosaccharyltransferase subunits and charperones, were also identified, albeit at low levels, following SEEL in the undifferentiated HEL cells. Based on the low level of spectral counts for these proteins and their appearance only in the non-SEEL labeled samples in the differentiated cells, these hits are likely nonspecific (supplemental File S1). Nonetheless, it is possible that a fraction of ER proteins escapes in these cells and traffics to the plasma membrane. Their presentation at the cell surface may also arise due to contacts made between the ER membrane and the plasma membrane (26Henne W.M. Liou J. Emr S.D. Molecular mechanisms of inter-organelle ER-PM contact sites.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 35: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Phillips M.J. Voeltz G.K. Structure and function of ER membrane contact sites with other organelles. Nature Reviews.Molecular Cell Biology. 2015; (in press)Google Scholar). Alternatively, ER-resident proteins may become exposed to the cell surface under specific circumstances including the onset of apoptosis (28Bilyy R.O. Shkandina T. Tomin A. Muñoz L.E. Franz S. Antonyuk V. Kit Y.Y. Zirngibl M. Fürnrohr B.G. Janko C. Lauber K. Schiller M. Schett G. Stoika R.S. Herrmann M.

Herrmann M. After shrinkage apoptotic cells expose internal membrane-derived epitopes on their plasma membranes.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). While the affinity-based analysis of sialoglycoproteins is powerful method, lectins or antibodies have not been in broad use with proteomic profiling of cellular sialoglycan or in search of disease biomarkers, because of their limited affinity, selectivity and availability for pan-specific sialoglycans. In this respect, SEEL provides an efficient strategy to assess the level of sialylation of glycoproteins for many reasons. First, SEEL can be applied to normally cultured cells without perturbation of the cellular metabolism. Second, since the SEEL signal reflects the level of available vacant sites for additional sialylation, the difference of SEEL signals between control cells and neuraminidase treated cells is proportional to the pre-existing sialic acid on cell surface, as was demonstrated using SEEL with CHO and Lec2 cells (Fig. 3). Third, the sialyltransferases such as ST6Gal1 or ST3Gal1 can add Neu5Ac9N3 to N-glycan or O-glycan selectively, yielding an opportunity to limit the type of glycoproteins analyzed. SEEL with concomitant use of two sialyltransferases provided the relative level of N-sialoglycoproteins with 2,6 linkage and that of O-sialoglycoproteins with 2,3 linkage. It is important to note that ST6Gal1 covers only 2,6-linked N-sialoglycoproteins. For covering the 2,3-linked N-sialoglycan, other sialyltransferase such as ST3Gal4 or ST3Gal6 could be employed. As another advantage, SEEL allows the degree of sialylation of cells to be analyzed at the level of individual protein. Although we only showed the relative level of sialylation of proteins by comparing spectral count of each protein, if desired, more precise comparison of the sialylation level is possible via the added step of stable isotope labeling of peptides. It should be noted that the signal in the anti-biotin Western blot is proportional to the total number of sialic acid residues, however, the spectral counts in the MS analysis is not. Rather the spectral count is proportional to the number of protein molecules that are pulled-down. Overall, 37% more spectral counts for sialoglycoproteins were identified by SEEL compared with metabolic labeling in MS analysis. In light of its ability to increase overall labeling above what can typically be achieved with metabolic labeling, and its ability to label unique glycoproteins, SEEL should prove advantageous for the analysis of glycoprotein levels at the cell surface as well as assessing the sialylation status of these glycoproteins. We envision that SEEL using sialyltransferases without prior neuraminidase treatment will represent a convenient method to survey the sialylation status of cells via its ability to modify available acceptors. In this case, an increase in SEEL labeling would reflect a greater availability of acceptors, an indirect measure of sialic acid occupancy. Neuraminidase-coupled SEEL, on the other hand, is ideal for the detection of cell surface sialoglycoproteins since the extent of tagging will depend on the amount of the glycoprotein at the cell surface instead of its original sialylation status.

https://openalex.org/W2224071190,"Life history theory (LHT) predicts a trade-off between reproductive effort and the pace of biological aging. Energy invested in reproduction is not available for tissue maintenance, thus having more offspring is expected to lead to accelerated senescence. Studies conducted in a variety of non-human species are consistent with this LHT prediction. Here we investigate the relationship between the number of surviving children born to a woman and telomere length (TL, a marker of cellular aging) over 13 years in a group of 75 Kaqchikel Mayan women. Contrary to LHT's prediction, women who had fewer children exhibited shorter TLs than those who had more children (p = 0.045) after controlling for TL at the onset of the 13-year study period. An ""ultimate"" explanation for this apparently protective effect of having more children may lay with human's cooperative-breeding strategy. In a number of socio-economic and cultural contexts, having more chilren appears to be linked to an increase in social support for mothers (e.g., allomaternal care). Higher social support, has been argued to reduce the costs of further reproduction. Lower reproductive costs may make more metabolic energy available for tissue maintenance, resulting in a slower pace of cellular aging. At a ""proximate"" level, mechanisms involved may include the actions of the gonadal steroid estradiol, which increases dramatically during pregnancy. Estradiol is known to protect TL from the effects of oxidative stress as well as increase telomerase activity, an enzyme that maintains TL. Future research should explore the potential role of social support as well as that of estradiol and other potential biological pathways in the trade-offs between reproductive effort and the pace of cellular aging within and among human as well as in non-human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2225845113,"The Juan Fernández and Desventuradas islands are among the few oceanic islands belonging to Chile. They possess a unique mix of tropical, subtropical, and temperate marine species, and although close to continental South America, elements of the biota have greater affinities with the central and south Pacific owing to the Humboldt Current, which creates a strong biogeographic barrier between these islands and the continent. The Juan Fernández Archipelago has ~700 people, with the major industry being the fishery for the endemic lobster, Jasus frontalis. The Desventuradas Islands are uninhabited except for a small Chilean military garrison on San Félix Island. We compared the marine biodiversity of these islands across multiple taxonomic groups. At San Ambrosio Island (SA), in Desventuradas, the laminarian kelp (Eisenia cokeri), which is limited to Desventuradas in Chile, accounted for >50% of the benthic cover at wave exposed areas, while more sheltered sites were dominated by sea urchin barrens. The benthos at Robinson Crusoe Island (RC), in the Juan Fernández Archipelago, comprised a diverse mix of macroalgae and invertebrates, a number of which are endemic to the region. The biomass of commercially targeted fishes was >2 times higher in remote sites around RC compared to sheltered locations closest to port, and overall biomass was 35% higher around SA compared to RC, likely reflecting fishing effects around RC. The number of endemic fish species was extremely high at both islands, with 87.5% of the species surveyed at RC and 72% at SA consisting of regional endemics. Remarkably, endemics accounted for 99% of the numerical abundance of fishes surveyed at RC and 96% at SA, which is the highest assemblage-level endemism known for any individual marine ecosystem on earth. Our results highlight the uniqueness and global significance of these biodiversity hotspots exposed to very different fishing pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2226186365,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1, an SF1B helicase, has been implicated in both mitochondrial and nuclear functions. Here we have characterized the preference of Pif1 for RNA:DNA heteroduplexes in vitro by investigating several kinetic parameters associated with unwinding. We show that the preferential unwinding of RNA:DNA hybrids is due to neither specific binding nor differences in the rate of strand separation. Instead, Pif1 is capable of unwinding RNA:DNA heteroduplexes with moderately greater processivity compared with its duplex DNA:DNA counterparts. This higher processivity of Pif1 is attributed to slower dissociation from RNA:DNA hybrids. Biologically, this preferential role of the helicase may contribute to its functions at both telomeric and nontelomeric sites."
https://openalex.org/W2228001113,"Six quadrate bones, of which two almost certainly come from the Kem Kem beds (Cenomanian, Upper Cretaceous) of south-eastern Morocco, are determined to be from juvenile and adult individuals of Spinosaurinae based on phylogenetic, geometric morphometric, and phylogenetic morphometric analyses. Their morphology indicates two morphotypes evidencing the presence of two spinosaurine taxa ascribed to Spinosaurus aegyptiacus and? Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis in the Cenomanian of North Africa, casting doubt on the accuracy of some recent skeletal reconstructions which may be based on elements from several distinct species. Morphofunctional analysis of the mandibular articulation of the quadrate has shown that the jaw mechanics was peculiar in Spinosauridae. In mature spinosaurids, the posterior parts of the two mandibular rami displaced laterally when the jaw was depressed due to a lateromedially oriented intercondylar sulcus of the quadrate. Such lateral movement of the mandibular ramus was possible due to a movable mandibular symphysis in spinosaurids, allowing the pharynx to be widened. Similar jaw mechanics also occur in some pterosaurs and living pelecanids which are both adapted to capture and swallow large prey items. Spinosauridae, which were engaged, at least partially, in a piscivorous lifestyle, were able to consume large fish and may have occasionally fed on other prey such as pterosaurs and juvenile dinosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2232337303,"We aimed to identify regional centres of plant biodiversity in South Australia, a sub-continental land area of 983,482 km2, by mapping a suite of metrics. Broad-brush conservation issues associated with the centres were mapped, specifically climate sensitivity, exposure to habitat fragmentation, introduced species and altered fire regimes. We compiled 727,417 plant species records from plot-based field surveys and herbarium records and mapped the following: species richness (all species; South Australian endemics; conservation-dependent species; introduced species); georeferenced weighted endemism, phylogenetic diversity, georeferenced phylogenetic endemism; and measures of beta diversity at local and state-wide scales. Associated conservation issues mapped were: climate sensitivity measured via ordination and non-linear modelling; habitat fragmentation represented by the proportion of remnant vegetation within a moving window; fire prone landscapes assessed using fire history records; invasive species assessed through diversity metrics, species distribution and literature. Compared to plots, herbarium data had higher spatial and taxonomic coverage but records were more biased towards major transport corridors. Beta diversity was influenced by sampling intensity and scale of comparison. We identified six centres of high plant biodiversity for South Australia: Western Kangaroo Island; Southern Mount Lofty Ranges; Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands; Southern Flinders Ranges; Southern Eyre Peninsula; Lower South East. Species composition in the arid-mediterranean ecotone was the most climate sensitive. Fragmentation mapping highlighted the dichotomy between extensive land-use and high remnancy in the north and intensive land-use and low remnancy in the south. Invasive species were most species rich in agricultural areas close to population centres. Fire mapping revealed large variation in frequency across the state. Biodiversity scores were not always congruent between metrics or datasets, notably for categorical endemism to South Australia versus georeferenced weighted endemism, justifying diverse approaches and cautious interpretation. The study could be extended to high resolution assessments of biodiversity centres and cost:benefit analysis for interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2224318158,"Due to the low structural diversity within the set of antimalarial drugs currently available in the clinic and the increasing number of cases of resistance, there is an urgent need to find new compounds with novel modes of action to treat the disease. Microbial natural products are characterized by their large diversity provided in terms of the chemical complexity of the compounds and the novelty of structures. Microbial natural products extracts have been underexplored in the search for new antiparasitic drugs and even more so in the discovery of new antimalarials. Our objective was to find new druggable natural products with antimalarial properties from the MEDINA natural products collection, one of the largest natural product libraries harboring more than 130,000 microbial extracts. In this work, we describe the optimization process and the results of a phenotypic high throughput screen (HTS) based on measurements of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase. A subset of more than 20,000 extracts from the MEDINA microbial products collection has been explored, leading to the discovery of 3 new compounds with antimalarial activity. In addition, we report on the novel antiplasmodial activity of 4 previously described natural products."
https://openalex.org/W2229698149,"Stem cells have recently garnered attention as drug and particle carriers to sites of tumors, due to their natural ability to track to the site of interest. Specifically, neural stem cells (NSCs) have demonstrated to be a promising candidate for delivering therapeutics to malignant glioma, a primary brain tumor that is not curable by current treatments, and inevitably fatal. In this article, we demonstrate that NSCs are able to internalize 2 μm magnetic discs (SD), without affecting the health of the cells. The SD can then be remotely triggered in an applied 1 T rotating magnetic field to deliver a payload. Furthermore, we use this NSC-SD delivery system to deliver the SD themselves as a therapeutic agent to mechanically destroy glioma cells. NSCs were incubated with the SD overnight before treatment with a 1T rotating magnetic field to trigger the SD release. The potential timed release effects of the magnetic particles were tested with migration assays, confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry for apoptosis. After the magnetic field triggered SD release, glioma cells were added and allowed to internalize the particles. Once internalized, another dose of the magnetic field treatment was administered to trigger mechanically induced apoptotic cell death of the glioma cells by the rotating SD. We are able to determine that NSC-SD and magnetic field treatment can achieve over 50% glioma cell death when loaded at 50 SD/cell, making this a promising therapeutic for the treatment of glioma."

(2n = 28, PPPP), a wild relative of common wheat, possesses many potentially valuable traits that can be transferred to common wheat through breeding programs. The wheat-A. cristatum disomic addition and translocation lines can be used as bridge materials to introduce alien chromosomal segments to wheat. Wheat-A. cristatum 2P disomic addition line II-9-3 was highly resistant to powdery mildew and leaf rust, which was reported in our previous study. However, some translocation lines induced from II-9-3 have not been reported. In this study, some translocation lines were induced from II-9-3 by 60Co-γ irradiation and gametocidal chromosome 2C and then identified by cytological methods. Forty-nine wheat-A. cristatum translocation lines were obtained and various translcoation types were identified by GISH (genomic in situ hybridization), such as whole-arm, segmental and intercalary translocations. Dual-color FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) was applied to identify the wheat chromosomes involved in the translocations, and the results showed that A. cristatum 2P chromosome segments were translocated to the different wheat chromosomes, including 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 3B, 5B, 7B, 1D, 4D and 6D. Many different types of wheat-A. cristatum alien translocation lines would be valuable for not only identifying and cloning A. cristatum 2P-related genes and understanding the genetics and breeding effects of the translocation between A. cristatum chromosome 2P and wheat chromosomes, but also providing new germplasm resources for the wheat genetic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2222751293,"Here we describe the natural occurrence of bacteria of the class Dehalococcoidia (DEH) and their diversity at different depths in anoxic waters of a remote meromictic lake (Lake Pavin) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. Detected DEH are phylogenetically diverse and the majority of 16S rRNA sequences have less than 91% similarity to previously isolated DEH 16S rRNA sequences. To predict the metabolic potential of detected DEH subgroups and to assess if they encode genes to transform halogenated compounds, we enriched DEH-affiliated genomic DNA by using a specific-gene capture method and probes against DEH-derived 16S rRNA genes, reductive dehalogenase genes and known insertion sequences. Two reductive dehalogenase homologous sequences were identified from DEH-enriched genomic DNA, and marker genes in the direct vicinity confirm that gene fragments were derived from DEH. The low sequence similarity with known reductive dehalogenase genes suggests yet-unknown catabolic potential in the anoxic zone of Lake Pavin."
https://openalex.org/W2227971133,"How animals navigate the constantly moving and visually uniform pelagic realm, often along straight paths between distant sites, is an enduring mystery. The mechanisms enabling pelagic navigation in cartilaginous fishes are particularly understudied. We used shoreward navigation by leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) as a model system to test whether olfaction contributes to pelagic navigation. Leopard sharks were captured alongshore, transported 9 km offshore, released, and acoustically tracked for approximately 4 h each until the transmitter released. Eleven sharks were rendered anosmic (nares occluded with cotton wool soaked in petroleum jelly); fifteen were sham controls. Mean swimming depth was 28.7 m. On average, tracks of control sharks ended 62.6% closer to shore, following relatively straight paths that were significantly directed over spatial scales exceeding 1600 m. In contrast, tracks of anosmic sharks ended 37.2% closer to shore, following significantly more tortuous paths that approximated correlated random walks. These results held after swimming paths were adjusted for current drift. This is the first study to demonstrate experimentally that olfaction contributes to pelagic navigation in sharks, likely mediated by chemical gradients as has been hypothesized for birds. Given the similarities between the fluid three-dimensional chemical atmosphere and ocean, further research comparing swimming and flying animals may lead to a unifying paradigm explaining their extraordinary navigational abilities."

We are exploring the guinea pig l-asparaginase (gpASNase1) as a potential replacement of the immunogenic bacterial enzymes. The exact mechanism used by l-asparaginases to catalyze the hydrolysis of asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia has been recently put into question. Earlier experimental data suggested that the reaction proceeds via a covalent intermediate using a ping-pong mechanism, whereas recent computational work advocates the direct displacement of the amine by an activated water. To shed light on this controversy, we generated gpASNase1 mutants of conserved active site residues (T19A, T116A, T19A/T116A, K188M, and Y308F) suspected to play a role in hydrolysis. Using x-ray crystallography, we determined the crystal structures of the T19A, T116A, and K188M mutants soaked in asparagine. We also characterized their steady-state kinetic properties and analyzed the conversion of asparagine to aspartate using NMR. Our structures reveal bound asparagine in the active site that has unambiguously not formed a covalent intermediate. Kinetic and NMR assays detect significant residual activity for all of the mutants. Furthermore, no burst of ammonia production was observed that would indicate covalent intermediate formation and the presence of a ping-pong mechanism. Hence, despite using a variety of techniques, we were unable to obtain experimental evidence that would support the formation of a covalent intermediate.

The specific miRNAs expressed at conception might be involved in pregnancy establishment and expression of let-7f-5p and let-7g-5p was experimentally up-regulated or inhibited to assess the effect on the expression of IGF2BP-1 and IGF2R in vitro, respectively. Samples of endometria and deciduas were obtained from 25 women who suffered from tubal or male factor subfertility and from 35 early pregnant women who underwent pregnancy termination at 6–8 weeks gestation were irrespectively collected and comparatively analyzed by miRNA sequencing and differential expression of known and novel miRNAs was analyzed using bioinformatics. The 2042 miRNA expression was analyzed in the study and the differential expression of six miRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR. The expression of four miRNAs in decidua samples was down-regulated (miR-34c, miR-92a, miR-181a-5p, and miR-191), whereas the expression of miR-10a-5p and let-7f-5p was significantly up-regulated. The expression of IGF2BP-1 and IGF2R declined and increased with overexpression and inhibition of let-7f-5p and let-7g-5p, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2227626608,"Researchers have analysed whether school and local knowledge complement or substitute each other, but have paid less attention to whether those two learning models use different cognitive strategies. In this study, we use data collected among three contemporary hunter-gatherer societies with relatively low levels of exposure to schooling yet with high levels of local ecological knowledge to test the association between i) schooling and ii) local ecological knowledge and verbal working memory. Participants include 94 people (24 Baka, 25 Punan, and 45 Tsimane') from whom we collected information on 1) schooling and school related skills (i.e., literacy and numeracy), 2) local knowledge and skills related to hunting and medicinal plants, and 3) working memory. To assess working memory, we applied a multi-trial free recall using words relevant to each cultural setting. People with and without schooling have similar levels of accurate and inaccurate recall, although they differ in their strategies to organize recall: people with schooling have higher results for serial clustering, suggesting better learning with repetition, whereas people without schooling have higher results for semantic clustering, suggesting they organize recall around semantically meaningful categories. Individual levels of local ecological knowledge are not related to accurate recall or organization recall, arguably due to overall high levels of local ecological knowledge. While schooling seems to favour some organization strategies this might come at the expense of some other organization strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2230674919,"Ulcerative Dermatitis (UD) is the most common cause of unplanned euthanasia in mice used in research, with prevalence rates reported between 4 and 21%. UD is characterized by a deep, ulcerative lesion that appears most commonly over the dorsal neck and is attendant with an intense pruritus. The underlying cause of UD is currently unknown, and as a consequence, there are no directed therapies that resolve lesions reliably. However, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests a behavioral component to the onset, maintenance, and progression of UD lesions. Scratching behavior in response to the intense pruritus associated with UD lesions may be an effective target for interventional therapies. We hypothesized that interfering with scratching behavior by trimming the toenails of mice with UD, would resolve UD lesions. To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated the efficacy of toenail trims with a single application of Vetericyn at the time of treatment versus our previous standard of care, topical Tresaderm applied daily. We found that toenail trims were significantly more effective at resolving lesions (n = 39 toenail trims, n = 100 Tresaderm, p<0.0001) with 93.3% of animals healing by 14 days (median time to lesion resolution). Furthermore, dorsal neck lesions did not recur by 42 days after a single toenail trim (n = 54); however, flank lesions did not resolve and the outcome of the two lesion distributions following treatment were significantly different (p<0.0001). Finally, we implemented toenail trims at an institutional level and found similar efficacies (approximately 90%) for toenail trims regardless of one-time topical supplement used (triple antibiotic ointment, Tresaderm, and Vetericyn, n = 55, 58, 18, p = 0.63). This is the first report of a highly effective treatment for one of the most serious welfare issues in laboratory mice."
https://openalex.org/W2224820439,"Background HER-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative effects in vitro and in vivo. The exact pathways through which TKIs exert their antineoplastic effects are, however, still not completely understood. Methods Using Milliplex assays, we have investigated the effects of the three panHER-TKIs lapatinib, canertinib and afatinib on signal transduction cascade activation in SKBR3, T47D and Jurkat neoplastic cell lines. The growth-inhibitory effect of blockade of HER and of JNK and STAT5 signaling was measured by proliferation- and apoptosis-assays using formazan dye labeling of viable cells, Western blotting for cleaved PARP-1 and immunolabeling for active caspase 3, respectively. Results All three HER-TKIs clearly inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in HER2 overexpressing SKBR3 cells, while their effect was less pronounced on HER2 moderately expressing T47D cells where they exerted only a weak antiproliferative and essentially no pro-apoptotic effect. Remarkably, phosphorylation/activation of JNK and STAT5A/B were inhibited by HER-TKIs only in the sensitive, but not in the resistant cells. In contrast, phosphorylation/activation of ERK/MAPK, STAT3, CREB, p70 S6 kinase, IkBa, and p38 were equally affected by HER-TKIs in both cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrated that direct pharmacological blockade of JNK and STAT5 abrogates cell growth in both HER-TKI-sensitive as well as -resistant breast cancer cells, respectively. Conclusion We have shown that HER-TKIs exert a HER2 expression-dependent anti-cancer effect in breast cancer cell lines. This involves blockade of JNK and STAT5A/B signaling, which have been found to be required for in vitro growth of these cell lines."

We investigated the pathogenetic mechanisms of splenomegaly in both portal hypertensive patients and rats, and tried to identify the possible therapy for this disease.Spleen samples were collected from portal hypertensive patients after splenectomy. Rat models of portal hypertension were induced by common bile duct ligation and partial portal vein ligation. Spleen samples from patients and rats were used to study the characteristics of splenomegaly by histological, immunohistochemical, and western blot analyses. Rapamycin or vehicle was administered to rats to determine the contribution of mTOR signaling pathway in the development of splenomegaly.We found that not only spleen congestion, but also increasing angiogenesis, fibrogenesis, inflammation and proliferation of splenic lymphoid tissue contributed to the development of splenomegaly in portal hypertensive patients and rats. Intriguingly, splenomegaly developed time-dependently in portal hypertensive rat that accompanied with progressive activation of mTOR signaling pathway. mTOR blockade by rapamycin profoundly ameliorated splenomegaly by limiting lymphocytes proliferation, angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and inflammation as well as decreasing portal pressure.This study provides compelling evidence indicating that mTOR signaling activation pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of splenomegaly in both portal hypertensive patients and rats. Therapeutic intervention targeting mTOR could be a promising strategy for patients with portal hypertension and splenomegaly."

In this study, we identified a novel exopeptidase, designated acylpeptidyl oligopeptidase (AOP), composed of 759 amino acid residues with active Ser(615) and encoded by PGN_1349 in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. AOP is currently listed as an unassigned S9 family peptidase or prolyl oligopeptidase. Recombinant AOP did not hydrolyze a Pro-Xaa bond. In addition, although sequence similarities to human and archaea-type acylaminoacyl peptidase sequences were observed, its enzymatic properties were apparently distinct from those, because AOP scarcely released an N-acyl-amino acid as compared with di- and tripeptides, especially with N-terminal modification. The kcat/Km value against benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Lys-Met-4-methycoumaryl-7-amide, the most potent substrate, was 123.3 ± 17.3 μm(-1) s(-1), optimal pH was 7-8.5, and the activity was decreased with increased NaCl concentrations. AOP existed predominantly in the periplasmic fraction as a monomer, whereas equilibrium between monomers and oligomers was observed with a recombinant molecule, suggesting a tendency of oligomerization mediated by the N-terminal region (Met(16)-Glu(101)). Three-dimensional modeling revealed the three domain structures (residues Met(16)-Ala(126), which has no similar homologue with known structure; residues Leu(127)-Met(495) (β-propeller domain); and residues Ala(496)-Phe(736) (α/β-hydrolase domain)) and further indicated the hydrophobic S1 site of AOP in accord with its hydrophobic P1 preference. AOP orthologues are widely distributed in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, suggesting its importance for processing of nutritional and/or bioactive oligopeptides."

https://openalex.org/W2222585144,"Past climate changes often have influenced the present distribution and intraspecific genetic diversity of organisms. The objective of this study was to investigate the phylogeography and historical demography of populations of Acromyrmex striatus (Roger, 1863), a leaf-cutting ant species restricted to the open plains of South America. Additionally, we modeled the distribution of this species to predict its contemporary and historic habitat. From the partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I of 128 A. striatus workers from 38 locations we estimated genetic diversity and inferred historical demography, divergence time, and population structure. The potential distribution areas of A. striatus for current and quaternary weather conditions were modeled using the maximum entropy algorithm. We identified a total of 58 haplotypes, divided into five main haplogroups. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the largest proportion of genetic variation is found among the groups of populations. Paleodistribution models suggest that the potential habitat of A. striatus may have decreased during the Last Interglacial Period (LIG) and expanded during the Last Maximum Glacial (LGM). Overall, the past potential distribution recovered by the model comprises the current potential distribution of the species. The general structuring pattern observed was consistent with isolation by distance, suggesting a balance between gene flow and drift. Analysis of historical demography showed that populations of A. striatus had remained constant throughout its evolutionary history. Although fluctuations in the area of their potential historic habitat occurred during quaternary climate changes, populations of A. striatus are strongly structured geographically. However, explicit barriers to gene flow have not been identified. These findings closely match those in Mycetophylax simplex, another ant species that in some areas occurs in sympatry with A. striatus. Ecophysiological traits of this species and isolation by distance may together have shaped the phylogeographic pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2229685038,"Since the early 2000s outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been described in several previously FMD-free Asian nations, including the Republic of Korea (South Korea). One outbreak with FMD virus (FDMV) serotype A and two with serotype O occurred in South Korea in 2010/2011. The causative viruses belonged to lineages that had been spreading in South East Asia, far East and East Asia since 2009 and presented a great threat to the countries in that region. Most FMDV strains infect ruminants and pigs, as it happened during the outbreaks of FMDV serotype O in South Korea. Contrastingly, the strain of serotype A affected only ruminants. Based upon these findings, the intention of the work described in the current report was to characterize and compare the infectivity, virulence and transmission of both strains under laboratory conditions in cattle and pigs, by direct inoculation and contact exposure. As expected, FMDV serotype O was highly virulent in both cattle and swine by contact exposure and direct inoculation. Surprisingly, FMDV serotype A was highly virulent in swine, but was less infectious in cattle by contact exposure to infected swine or cattle. Interestingly, similar quantities of aerosolized FMDV RNA were detected during experiments with viruses of serotypes O and A. Specific virus-host interaction of A/SKR/2010 could affect the transmission of this strain to cattle, and this may explain in part the limited spread of the serotype A epizootic."
https://openalex.org/W2232582199,"Yersinia enterocolitica is a major cause of human yersiniosis, with enterocolitis being a typical manifestation. These bacteria can cross the intestinal mucosa, and invade eukaryotic cells by binding to host β1 integrins, a process mediated by the bacterial effector protein invasin. This study examines the role of hypoxia on the internalization of Y. enterocolitica into intestinal epithelial cells, since the gastrointestinal tract has been shown to be physiologically deficient in oxygen levels (hypoxic), especially in cases of infection and inflammation. We show that hypoxic pre-incubation of Caco-2 cells resulted in significantly decreased bacterial internalization compared to cells grown under normoxia. This phenotype was absent after functionally blocking host β1 integrins as well as upon infection with an invasin-deficient Y. enterocolitica strain. Furthermore, downstream phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase was also reduced under hypoxia after infection. In good correlation to these data, cells grown under hypoxia showed decreased protein levels of β1 integrins at the apical cell surface whereas the total protein level of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1) alpha was elevated. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the HIF-1 α stabilizer dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) also reduced invasion and decreased β1 integrin protein levels compared to control cells, indicating a potential role for HIF-1α in this process. These results suggest that hypoxia decreases invasin-integrin-mediated internalization of Y. enterocolitica into intestinal epithelial cells by reducing cell surface localization of host β1 integrins."

The aim of our study is to confirm whether use of these medications is associated with survival benefit. Methods Consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed, stage 4 SCLC were analyzed in this retrospective study. Patients that were prescribed statins, aspirin, clomipramine (tricyclic antidepressant; TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), doxazosin or prazosin (α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists; ADRA1) were identified. Results There were a total of 876 patients. Aspirin, statins, SSRIs, ADRA1, and TCA were administered in 138, 72, 20, 28, and 5 cases, respectively. A statistically significant increase in median OS was observed only in statin-treated patients when compared to those not receiving any of the aforementioned medications (OS, 8.4 vs. 6.1 months, respectively; p = 0.002). The administration of SSRIs, aspirin, and ADRA1 did not result in a statistically significant OS benefit (median OS, 8.5, 6.8, and 6.0 months, respectively). The multivariate Cox model showed that, besides age and ECOG PS, radiotherapy was an independent survival predictor (Hazard Ratio, 2.151; 95% confidence interval, 1.828–2.525; p <0.001). Conclusions Results of drug repositioning studies using only preclinical data or small numbers of patients should be treated with caution before application in the clinic. Our data demonstrated that radiotherapy appears to be an independent survival predictor in stage 4 SCLC, therefore confirming the results of other prospective and retrospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W2224441186,"The timing, intensity, and duration of exposure to both artificial and natural light have acute metabolic and physiological effects in mammals. Recent research in human adults suggests exposure to moderate intensity light later in the day is concurrently associated with increased body mass; however, no studies have investigated the effect of light exposure on body mass in young children. We examined objectively measured light exposure and body mass of 48 preschool-aged children at baseline, and measured their body mass again 12 months later. At baseline, moderate intensity light exposure earlier in the day was associated with increased body mass index (BMI). Increased duration of light exposure at baseline predicted increased BMI 12-months later, even after controlling for baseline sleep duration, sleep timing, BMI, and activity. The findings identify that light exposure may be a contributor to the obesogenic environment during early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2228756597,"Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract contribute to exacerbations and disease progression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is also an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in COPD. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood but include impaired mucociliary clearance and structural remodeling of the airways. In addition, antimicrobial proteins that are constitutively expressed or induced during inflammatory conditions are an important part of the airway innate host defense. In the present study, we show that osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional glycoprotein that is highly upregulated in the airways of COPD patients co-localizes with several antimicrobial proteins expressed in the airways. In vitro, OPN bound lactoferrin, secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), midkine, human beta defensin-3 (hBD-3), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) but showed low or no affinity for lysozyme and LL-37. Binding of OPN impaired the antibacterial activity against the important bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, OPN reduced lysozyme-induced killing of S. pneumoniae, a finding that could be explained by binding of OPN to the bacterial surface, thereby shielding the bacteria. A fragment of OPN generated by elastase of P. aeruginosa retained some inhibitory effect. Some antimicrobial proteins have additional functions. However, the muramidase-activity of lysozyme and the protease inhibitory function of SLPI were not affected by OPN. Taken together, OPN can contribute to the impairment of innate host defense by interfering with the function of antimicrobial proteins, thus increasing the vulnerability to acquire infections during COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2224055198,"Facial expressions aid social transactions and serve as socialization tools, with smiles signaling approval and reward, and angry faces signaling disapproval and punishment. The present study examined whether the subjective experience of positive vs. negative facial expressions differs between children and adults. Specifically, we examined age-related differences in biases toward happy and angry facial expressions. Young children (5-7 years) and young adults (18-29 years) rated the intensity of happy and angry expressions as well as levels of experienced arousal. Results showed that young children-but not young adults-rated happy facial expressions as both more intense and arousing than angry faces. This finding, which we replicated in two independent samples, was not due to differences in the ability to identify facial expressions, and suggests that children are more tuned to information in positive expressions. Together these studies provide evidence that children see unambiguous adult emotional expressions through rose-colored glasses, and suggest that what is emotionally relevant can shift with development."
https://openalex.org/W2228556346,"Suppression of Tumorigenicity 2 (ST2), a member of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family, activates type 2 immune responses to pathogens and tissue damage via binding to IL-33. Dysregulated responses contribute to asthma, graft-versus-host and autoinflammatory diseases and disorders. To study ST2 structure for inhibitor development, we performed the principal component (PC) analysis on the crystal structures of IL1-1R1, IL1-1R2, ST2 and the refined ST2 ectodomain (ST2ECD) models, constructed from previously reported small-angle X-ray scattering data. The analysis facilitates mapping of the ST2ECD conformations to PC subspace for characterizing structural changes. Extensive coverage of ST2ECD conformations was then obtained using the accelerated molecular dynamics simulations started with the IL-33 bound ST2ECD structure as instructed by their projected locations on the PC subspace. Cluster analysis of all conformations further determined representative conformations of ST2ECD ensemble in solution. Alignment of the representative conformations with the ST2/IL-33 structure showed that the D3 domain of ST2ECD (containing D1-D3 domains) in most conformations exhibits no clashes with IL-33 in the crystal structure. Our experimental binding data informed that the D1-D2 domain of ST2ECD contributes predominantly to the interaction between ST2ECD and IL-33 underscoring the importance of the D1-D2 domain in binding. Computational binding site assessment revealed one third of the total detected binding sites in the representative conformations may be suitable for binding to potent small molecules. Locations of these sites include the D1-D2 domain ST2ECD and modulation sites conformed to ST2ECD conformations. Our study provides structural models and analyses of ST2ECD that could be useful for inhibitor discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2228736265,"Mammals developed antioxidant systems to defend against oxidative damage in their daily life. Enzymatic antioxidants and low molecular weight antioxidants (LMWAs) constitute major parts of the antioxidant systems. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2, encoded by the Nrf2 gene) is a central transcriptional regulator, regulating transcription, of many antioxidant enzymes. Frugivorous bats eat large amounts of fruits that contain high levels of LMWAs such as vitamin C, thus, a reliance on LMWAs might greatly reduce the need for antioxidant enzymes in comparison to insectivorous bats. Therefore, it is possible that frugivorous bats have a reduced need for Nrf2 function due to their substantial intake of diet-antioxidants. To test whether the Nrf2 gene has undergone relaxed evolution in fruit-eating bats, we obtained Nrf2 sequences from 16 species of bats, including four Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) and one New World fruit bat (Phyllostomidae). Our molecular evolutionary analyses revealed changes in the selection pressure acting on Nrf2 gene and identified seven specific amino acid substitutions that occurred on the ancestral lineage leading to Old World fruit bats. Biochemical experiments were conducted to examine Nrf2 in Old World fruit bats and showed that the amount of catalase, which is regulated by Nrf2, was significantly lower in the brain, heart and liver of Old World fruit bats despite higher levels of Nrf2 protein in Old World fruit bats. Computational predictions suggest that three of these seven amino acid replacements might be deleterious to Nrf2 function. Therefore, the results suggest that Nrf2 gene might have experienced relaxed constraint in Old World fruit bats, however, we cannot rule out the possibility of positive selection. Our study provides the first data on the molecular adaptation of Nrf2 gene in frugivorous bats in compensation to the increased levels of LWMAs from their fruit-diet."
https://openalex.org/W2224819999,"Summarization is a process to select important information from a source text. Summarizing strategies are the core cognitive processes in summarization activity. Since summarization can be important as a tool to improve comprehension, it has attracted interest of teachers for teaching summary writing through direct instruction. To do this, they need to review and assess the students' summaries and these tasks are very time-consuming. Thus, a computer-assisted assessment can be used to help teachers to conduct this task more effectively.This paper aims to propose an algorithm based on the combination of semantic relations between words and their syntactic composition to identify summarizing strategies employed by students in summary writing. An innovative aspect of our algorithm lies in its ability to identify summarizing strategies at the syntactic and semantic levels. The efficiency of the algorithm is measured in terms of Precision, Recall and F-measure. We then implemented the algorithm for the automated summarization assessment system that can be used to identify the summarizing strategies used by students in summary writing."
https://openalex.org/W2229404153,"Cryogenic treatments and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) determine the survival rate of organisms that undergo cryopreservation, but their mechanisms of operation have not yet been characterised adequately. In particular, the way in which membrane lipids respond to cryogenic treatments and CPAs is unknown. We developed comparative profiles of the changes in membrane lipids among cryogenic treatments and between the CPAs dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methanol (MeOH) for the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found that freezing in liquid nitrogen led to a dramatic degradation of lipids, and that thawing at warm temperature (35°C) induced lipid remodelling. DMSO did not protect membranes, but MeOH significantly attenuated lipid degradation. The presence of MeOH during cooling (from 25°C to −55°C at a rate of 1°C/min) sustained the lipid composition to the extent that membrane integrity was maintained; this phenomenon accounts for successful cryopreservation. An increase in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and a decrease in diacylglycerol were the major changes in lipid composition associated with survival rate, but there was no transformation between these lipid classes. Phospholipase D-mediated phosphatidic acid was not involved in freezing-induced lipid metabolism in C. reinhardtii. Lipid unsaturation changed, and the patterns of change depended on the cryogenic treatment. Our results provide new insights into the cryopreservation of, and the lipid metabolism in, algae."
https://openalex.org/W2235260589,"HIV-1 depends on host-cell-encoded factors to complete its life cycle. A comprehensive understanding of how HIV-1 manipulates host machineries during viral infection can facilitate the identification of host targets for antiviral drugs or gene therapy. The cellular protein Naf1 (HIV-1 Nef-associated factor 1) is a CRM1-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, and has been identified to regulate multiple receptor-mediated signal pathways in inflammation. The cytoplasm-located Naf1 can inhibit NF-κB activation through binding to A20, and the loss of Naf1 controlled NF-κB activation is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases. However, the effect of Naf1 on HIV-1 mRNA expression has not been characterized. In this study we found that the nucleus-located Naf1 could promote nuclear export of unspliced HIV-1 gag mRNA. We demonstrated that the association between Naf1 and CRM1 was required for this function as the inhibition or knockdown of CRM1 expression significantly impaired Naf1-promoted HIV-1 production. The mutation of Naf1 nuclear export signals (NESs) that account for CRM1 recruitment for nuclear export decreased Naf1 function. Additionally, the mutation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Naf1 diminished its ability to promote HIV-1 production, demonstrating that the shuttling property of Naf1 is required for this function. Our results reveal a novel role of Naf1 in enhancing HIV-1 production, and provide a potential therapeutic target for controlling HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2225664584,"The horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus is a unique marine species and a potential model for marine invertebrate. Limited genomic and transcriptional data are currently available to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the embryonic development of T. tridentatus. Here, we reported for the first time the de novo transcriptome assembly for T. tridentatus at embryonic developmental stage using Illumina RNA-seq platform. Approximate 38 million reads were obtained and further assembled into 133,212 unigenes. Sequence homology analysis against public databases revealed that 33,796 unigenes could be annotated with gene descriptions. Of the annotated unigenes, we identified a number of key components of several conserved metazoan signaling pathways (Hedgehog, Wnt, TGF-beta and Notch pathways) and other important regulatory genes involved in embryonic development. Targeted searching of Pax family genes which play critical roles in the formation of tissue and organ during embryonic development identified a complete set of Pax family genes. Moreover, the full length T. tridentatus Pax1/9a (TtPax1/9a) and Pax1/9b (TtPax1/9b) cDNA sequences were determined based on the transcriptome, demonstrating the immediate application of our database. Using quantitative real time PCR, we analyzed the expression patterns of TtPax1/9a and TtPax1/9b in different tissues of horseshoe crab. Taking advantage of Drosophila model, we further found that TtPax1/9b, but not TtPax1/9a, can partly rescue the Drosophila homolog Poxm dysfunction-caused lethality at the larval stage. Our study provides the embryonic transcriptome of T. tridentatus which could be immediately used for gene discovery and characterization, functional genomics studies in T. tridentatus. This transcriptome database will also facilitate the investigations of molecular mechanisms underlying embryonic development of T. tridentatus and other marine arthropods as well."
https://openalex.org/W2229530258,"Platoon based traffic flow models form the underlying theoretical framework in traffic simulation tools. They are essentially important in facilitating efficient performance calculation and evaluation in urban traffic networks. For this purpose, a new platoon-based macroscopic model called the LWR-IM has been developed in [1]. Preliminary analytical validation conducted previously has proven the feasibility of the model. In this paper, the LWR-IM is further enhanced with algorithms that describe platoon interactions in urban arterials. The LWR-IM and the proposed platoon interaction algorithms are implemented in the real-world class I and class II urban arterials. Another purpose of the work is to perform quantitative validation to investigate the validity and ability of the LWR-IM and its underlying algorithms to describe platoon interactions and simulate performance indices that closely resemble the real traffic situations. The quantitative validation of the LWR-IM is achieved by performing a two-sampled t-test on queues simulated by the LWR-IM and real queues observed at these real-world locations. The results reveal insignificant differences of simulated queues with real queues where the p-values produced concluded that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Thus, the quantitative validation further proved the validity of the LWR-IM and the embedded platoon interactions algorithm for the intended purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2225867159,"Chronic increases in blood flow in resistance arteries induce outward remodeling associated with increased wall thickness and endothelium-mediated dilatation. This remodeling is essential for collateral arteries growth following occlusion of a large artery. As estrogens have a major role in this remodeling, we hypothesized that resveratrol, described as possessing phytoestrogen properties, could improve remodeling in ovariectomized rats.Blood flow was increased in vivo in mesenteric arteries after ligation of adjacent arteries in 3-month old ovariectomized rats treated with resveratrol (5 or 37.5 mg/kg per day: RESV5 or RESV37.5) or vehicle. After 2 weeks arterial structure and function were measured in vitro in high flow (HF) and normal flow (NF) arteries isolated from each rat.Arterial diameter was greater in HF than in NF arteries in ovariectomized rats treated with RESV5 or RESV37.5, not in vehicle-treated rats. In mice lacking estrogen receptor alpha diameter was equivalent in HF and NF arteries whereas in mice treated with RESV5 diameter was greater in HF than in NF vessels. A compensatory increase in wall thickness and a greater phenylephrine-mediated contraction were observed in HF arteries. This was more pronounced in HF arteries from RESV37.5-treated rats. ERK1/2 phosphorylation, involved in hypertrophy and contraction, were higher in RESV37.5-treated rats than in RESV5- and vehicle-treated rats. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was greater in HF than in NF arteries in RESV5-treated rats only. In HF arteries from RESV37.5-treated rats relaxation was increased by superoxide reduction and markers of oxidative stress (p67phox, GP91phox) were higher than in the 2 other groups.Resveratrol improved flow-mediated outward remodeling in ovariectomized rats thus providing a potential therapeutic tool in menopause-associated ischemic disorders. This effect seems independent of the estrogen receptor alpha. Nevertheless, caution should be taken with high doses inducing excessive contractility and hypertrophy in association with oxidative stress in HF arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2228217174,"The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by binding of a Fas ligand to the ectodomain of the surface death receptor Fas protein. Subsequently, the intracellular death domain of Fas (FasDD) and that of the Fas-associated protein (FADD) interact to form the core of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), a crucial step for activation of caspases that induce cell death. Previous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is recruited into the DISC in cholangiocarcinoma cells and specifically interacts with FasDD to regulate the apoptotic/survival signaling pathway. Inhibition of CaM activity in DISC stimulates apoptosis significantly. We have recently shown that CaM forms a ternary complex with FasDD (2:1 CaM:FasDD). However, the molecular mechanism by which CaM binds to two distinct FasDD motifs is not fully understood. Here, we employed mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), biophysical, and biochemical methods to identify the binding regions of FasDD and provide a molecular basis for the role of CaM in Fas–mediated apoptosis. Proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry data revealed that peptides spanning residues 209–239 (Fas-Pep1) and 251–288 (Fas-Pep2) constitute the two CaM-binding regions of FasDD. To determine the molecular mechanism of interaction, we have characterized the binding of recombinant/synthetic Fas-Pep1 and Fas-Pep2 peptides with CaM. Our data show that both peptides engage the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM simultaneously. Binding of Fas-Pep1 to CaM is entropically driven while that of Fas-Pep2 to CaM is enthalpically driven, indicating that a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces contribute to the stabilization of the FasDD–CaM complex. Our data suggest that because Fas-Pep1 and Fas-Pep2 are involved in extensive intermolecular contacts with the death domain of FADD, binding of CaM to these regions may hinder its ability to bind to FADD, thus greatly inhibiting the initiation of apoptotic signaling pathway."
