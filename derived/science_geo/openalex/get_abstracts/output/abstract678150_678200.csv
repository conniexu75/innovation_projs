https://openalex.org/W3186410095,"The COVID-19 outbreak has struck Lebanon in its worst period of instability, not only impacting physical health, but also increasing psychological distress. Using an online survey enhanced by response time measurement, this study describes the overall patterns in mental well-being outcomes and examines their association with sociodemographic characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it identifies significant predictors for COVID-19 good practices. A total of 988 Lebanese were surveyed, with participants providing written online consent prior to filling the survey. Regression-based models were estimated. Findings show that individuals with higher education levels exhibit lower health concerns. People with children face higher health worries than those without. Men are more worried than women about their health and they are less satisfied with their lives during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics show that most Lebanese are very satisfied with their families (93.1%), but they are highly dissatisfied with their country (63%). Young adults and individuals who live alone exhibit significantly higher social well-being concerns. Age and having children were strong predictors for good COVID-19 practices. The odds of having good practices for older adults are 3.13 times higher than that of youth, while the odds for those with children are 3.18 times higher than those without. The findings of this study could pave the way for a well-coordinated national strategy and increased collaboration with public health professionals to mitigate the pandemic’s adverse effects on mental health in the long-term."
https://openalex.org/W3162564387,"Aims The present study aimed to investigate whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis varied with regards to young Swiss men’s pre-crisis level of education and socioeconomic status and to changes in their work situation due to it. Methods A cohort of 2345 young Swiss men (from 21 out of 26 Swiss cantons; mean age = 29) completed survey-based assessments shortly before (April 2019 to February 2020) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (May to June 2020). Outcomes measured were psychological outcomes before and during the COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and the fear, isolation and psychological trauma induced by it. We investigated associations between these outcomes and their predictors: pre-crisis socioeconomic status (relative financial status, difficulty paying bills, level of education), changes in work situation during the crisis (job loss, partial unemployment, working from home, change in workload) and working in contact with potentially infected people, both inside and outside the healthcare sector. For outcomes measured before and during the crisis, the analyses were adjusted for their pre-crisis levels. Results About 21% of participants changed their employment status (job loss, partial unemployment or lost money if self-employed) and more than 40% worked predominantly from home during the COVID-19 crisis. Participants with a lower relative socioeconomic status already before the crisis experienced a higher psychological impact due to the COVID-19 crisis, compared to participants with an average socioeconomic status (major depression (b = 0.12 [0.03, 0.22]), perceived stress (b = 0.15 [0.05, 0.25]), psychological trauma (b = 0.15 [0.04, 0.26]), fear (b = 0.20 [0.10, 0.30]) and isolation (b = 0.19 [0.08, 0.29])). A higher impact was also felt by participants who lost their job due to the COVID-19 crisis, the partially unemployed, those with an increased workload or those who worked mainly from home (e.g. depression b = 0.25 [0.16, 0.34] for those working 90%+ at home, compared to those not working at home). Conclusions Even in a country like Switzerland, with relatively high social security benefits and universal healthcare, the COVID-19 crisis had a considerable psychological impact, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status and those who experienced deteriorations in their work situation due to the COVID-19 crisis. Supporting these populations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of inequalities in mental health and social status. Such support could help to lower the overall impact of the crisis on the mental well-being of Switzerland’s population."
https://openalex.org/W3184191187,"Consumers' preferences for products derived from genetic improvements and innovations in plant breeding are often conditioned by technophobia and negative public imaginaries. The current study addresses this issue by analyzing consumers' monetary preferences for a win-win innovation (generating gains for both private actors and the community) in the viticulture sector, namely fungus resistant grapes (FRG). The use of these grapes reduces the quantity of chemical inputs applied to vineyards, simultaneously improving firms' economic performance. This study aimed to assess whether consumers prefer wines originating from FRG varieties to conventional wines. In particular, through an experimental online survey involving 627 Italian regular wine drinkers, the study compares individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for conventional wines with the WTP for two FRG wines produced with two different techniques: horticultural hybridization and genome editing. The study also assesses the potential effect of polarized media coverage on preferences by testing, in a between-subjects experimental design, two diverging (positive/negative) information scenarios, and the core drivers of these preferences. The findings suggest that respondents express a premium price for horticultural FRG wines compared to conventional wines (+9.14%) and a strong discount for genome edited FRG wines (-21.13%). The results also reveal that negative information reduces consumers' WTP for horticultural FRG wines, while positive information increases their WTP for genome edited FRG wines. Last, the study highlights that individuals concerned with food sustainability issues and knowledgeable about wine are more likely to accept both FRG typologies. Overall, the study confirms the crucial role of appropriate information for market acceptance of innovations based on plant genetics to foster the adoption of sustainable pest-reducing practices in wine production."
https://openalex.org/W3185364303,"Lung function declines as people age and their lungs become stiffer. With an increasing elderly population, understanding mechanisms that contribute to these structural and functional changes in the aging lung is important. Part of the aging process is characterized by thicker, more fibrotic airways, and senile emphysema caused by changes in lung parenchyma. There is also senescence, which occurs throughout the body with aging. Here, using human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells from patients in different age groups, we explored senescence pathways and changes in intracellular calcium signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition to elucidate potential mechanisms by which aging leads to thicker and stiffer lungs. Senescent markers p21, γH2AX, and β-gal, and some senescence-associated secretory proteins (SASP) increased with aging, as shown by staining and biochemical analyses. Agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ responses, measured using fura-2 loaded cells and fluorescence imaging, increased with age. However, biochemical analysis showed that expression of the following markers decreased with age: M3 muscarinic receptor, TRPC3, Orai1, STIM1, SERCA2, MMP2 and MMP9. In contrast, collagen III, and fibronectin deposition increased with age. These data show that senescence increases in the aging airways that is associated with a stiffer but surprisingly greater intracellular calcium signaling as a marker for contractility. ASM senescence may enhance fibrosis in a feed forward loop promoting remodeling and altered calcium storage and buffering."
https://openalex.org/W3183643744,"Five essential oil hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) cultivars (Cherry Blossom, Cherry Blossom (Tuan), Berry Blossom, Cherry Wine, and Cherry Blossom × Trump) were treated with six fertigation treatments to quantify the effects of synthetic fertilizer rates and irrigation electrical conductivity on plant growth, biomass accumulation, and cannabinoid profiles. Irrigation water was injected with a commercial 20-20-20 fertilizer at rates of 0, 50, 150, 300, 450, and 600 ppm nitrogen equating to 0.33 (control), 0.54, 0.96, 1.59, 2.22, and 2.85 dS m-1, respectively. Plants were grown under artificial lighting (18 hr) to maintain vegetative growth for eight weeks, followed by an eight-week flowering period. High linear relationship between chlorophyll concentrations and SPAD-502 measurements validated the utilization of SPAD meters to rapidly identify nutrient deficiency in essential oil hemp. Cultivars expressed significant variation in plant height and cannabinoid profiles (% dry mass), in concurrence with limited biomass and cannabinoid (g per plant) yield variation. Cherry Blossom was the best performing cultivar and Cherry Wine was the least productive. Variation in plant growth, biomass, and cannabinoid concentrations were affected to a greater extent by fertilizer rates. Optimal fertilizer rates were observed at 50 ppm N, while increased fertilizer rates significantly reduced plant growth, biomass accumulation, and cannabinoid concentrations. Increased fertilizer rates (> 300 ppm N) resulted in compliant THC levels (< 0.3%), although when coupled with biomass reductions resulted in minimal cannabinoid yields. Additionally, CBD concentration demonstrated higher sensitivity to increased fertilizer rates (> 300 ppm N) compared to THC and CBG (> 450 ppm N). The results of this study can serve as a guide when using fertigation methods on essential oil hemp cultivars; although results may differ with cultivar selection, environmental conditions, and management practices."
https://openalex.org/W3185791392,"Activating mutations in KIT/PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases drive gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). KIT/PDGFRA inhibitors, such as imatinib do not evoke an effective cytocidal response, leaving room for quiescence and development of multiple secondary resistance mutations. As the majority of the secondary resistance clones activate PI3K and MAPK pathways, we investigated whether combined targeting of KIT/PI3K/MAPK (KPM) pathways overcomes drug resistance and quiescence in GIST cells. We monitored the proliferation of imatinib-sensitive and-resistant GIST cell lines after treating them with various combinations of drugs to inhibit KPM pathways. Cytocidal response was evaluated through proliferation, apoptosis and colony outgrowth assays. Combined inhibition of KPM signaling pathways using a KPM inhibitor cocktail decreased the survival of drug-resistant GIST cells and dramatically reduced their proliferation. Downstream pathway analysis showed that the residual PI3K/MAPK signaling observed after KIT inhibitor treatment plays a role in mediating quiescence and drug resistance. The KPM inhibitor cocktail with sunitinib or regorafenib effectively induced apoptosis and prevented colony outgrowth after long-term drug removal, suggesting that it can be used as an effective strategy against quiescence and drug resistance in metastatic GIST."
https://openalex.org/W3186749653,"Background Patients presenting with the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) may have a high risk of cardiovascular adverse events, including death from cardiovascular causes. The long-term cardiovascular outcomes of these patients are entirely unknown. We aim to perform a registry of patients who have undergone a diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and to determine their long-term cardiovascular outcomes. Study and design This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective registry to be conducted at 17 centers in Spain and Italy (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04359927). Consecutive patients older than 18 years, who underwent a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV2 in the participating institutions, will be included since March 2020, to August 2020. Patients will be classified into two groups, according to the results of the RT-PCR: COVID-19 positive or negative. The primary outcome will be cardiovascular mortality at 1 year. The secondary outcomes will be acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, pulmonary embolism, and serious cardiac arrhythmias, at 1 year. Outcomes will be compared between the two groups. Events will be adjudicated by an independent clinical event committee. Conclusion The results of this registry will contribute to a better understanding of the long-term cardiovascular implications of the COVID19."
https://openalex.org/W3183730521,"Florida's waters are a reservoir for a host of pathogens and toxins. Many of these microorganisms cause water-related diseases in people that are reportable to the Florida Department of Health. Our objective in this review was to ascertain which water-related pathogens and toxins of public health importance have been found in animal populations in Florida over the last twenty years.Nineteen databases were searched, including PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection, using keywords and search terms for the waterborne diseases, water-related vector-borne diseases, and water-based toxins reportable to the Florida Department of Health. For inclusion, peer-reviewed journal articles were to be written in English, published between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2019, and contain primary research findings documenting at least one of the water-related pathogens or toxins of interest in an animal population within Florida during this same time frame.Of over eight thousand initial search results, 65 studies were included for final analysis. The most common animal types implicated in the diseases of interest included marine mammals, fish and shellfish, wild birds, and livestock. Toxins or pathogens most often associated with these animals included toxin-producer Karenia brevis, vibriosis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonellosis.Findings from this review elucidate the water-related disease-causing pathogens and toxins which have been reported within animal populations in recent Florida history. As most of these diseases are zoonotic, our results suggest a One Health approach is necessary to support and maintain healthy water systems throughout the state of Florida for the protection of both human and animal populations."
https://openalex.org/W3184268847,"Ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging (OOPS) and middle ear risk index (MERI) are the most commonly used indices for predicting prognosis of patients with chronic otitis media (COM). This study aimed to verify the efficiency of OOPS and MERI scores in predicting outcomes of patients with COM who underwent tympanoplasty.We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent tympanoplasty (n = 526). OOPS, and MERI scores were collected. Hearing data were measured 1 day preoperatively, and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Operation success was defined according to the Korean Society of Otology guidelines.For calculation of success, the ROC values of MERI were 0.551 at 12 months. ROC values of OOPS were 0.637 at 12 months. There were no significant differences in hearing variables among the three groups according to MERI. There were significantly favorable outcomes in hearing variables in the low-risk group in OOPS. The mean OOPS score was greater in patients with success than those with non-success. Otorrhea, ossicle status, and status of mucosa as variables in both indices were associated with success. The type of mastoidectomy as a variable in OOPS alone was associated with success. Absence of hypertension, presence of ossiculoplasty, and use of incus as ossiculoplasty material were associated with poor success rate.Compared with MERI, the OOPS index was more closely associated with the hearing outcomes, which may be due to the extent of inflammation in the OOPS index."
https://openalex.org/W3184397088,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic forced a reconsideration of surgical patient management in the setting of scarce resources and risk of viral transmission. Herein we assess the impact of implementing a protocol of more rigorous patient education, recovery room assessment for non-ICU admission, earlier mobilization and post-discharge communication for patients undergoing brain tumor surgery. Methods A case-control retrospective review was undertaken at a community hospital with a dedicated neurosurgery and otolaryngology team using minimally invasive surgical techniques, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and early post-operative imaging protocols. All patients undergoing craniotomy or endoscopic endonasal removal of a brain, skull base or pituitary tumor were included during two non-overlapping periods: March 2019–January 2020 (pre-pandemic epoch) versus March 2020–January 2021 (pandemic epoch with streamlined care protocol implemented). Data collection included demographics, preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, tumor pathology, and tumor resection and remission rates. Primary outcomes were ICU utilization and hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were complications, readmissions and reoperations. Findings Of 295 patients, 163 patients were treated pre-pandemic (58% women, mean age 53.2±16 years) and 132 were treated during the pandemic (52% women, mean age 52.3±17 years). From pre-pandemic to pandemic, ICU utilization decreased from 92(54%) to 43(29%) of operations (p&lt;0.001) and hospital LOS≤1 day increased from 21(12.2%) to 60(41.4%), p&lt;0.001, respectively. For craniotomy cohort, median LOS was 2 days for both epochs; median ICU LOS decreased from 1 to 0 days (p&lt;0.001), ICU use decreased from 73(80%) to 29(33%),(p&lt;0.001). For endonasal cohort, median LOS decreased from 2 to 1 days; median ICU LOS was 0 days for both epochs; (p&lt;0.001). There were no differences pre-pandemic versus pandemic in ASA scores, resection/remission rates, readmissions or reoperations. Conclusion This experience suggests the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for implementing a brain tumor care protocol to facilitate safely decreasing ICU utilization and accelerating discharge home without an increase in complications, readmission or reoperations. More rigorous patient education, recovery room assessment for non-ICU admission, earlier mobilization and post-discharge communication, layered upon a foundation of minimally invasive surgery, TIVA anesthesia and early post-operative imaging are possible contributors to these favorable trends."
https://openalex.org/W3184481938,"Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF) can prevent up to 13% of under-five mortality in developing countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa the rate of EBF at six months remains very low at 36%. Different types of factors such as maternal, family and work-related factors are responsible for the low rate of EBF among employed women. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of EBF continuation and associated factors among employed women in North Ethiopia.A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in two towns of Tigray region, North Ethiopia. Employed women who had children between six months and two years were surveyed using multistage, convenience sampling. Women filled in a paper based validated questionnaire adopted from the Breastfeeding and Employment Study toolkit (BESt). The questions were grouped into four parts of sociodemographic characteristics, maternal characteristics, family support and work-related factors. Factors associated with EBF continuation as a binary outcome (yes/no) were determined using multivariable logistic regression.Four-hundred and forty-nine women participated in this study with a mean (SD) age 30.4 (4.2) years. Two hundred and fifty-four (56.4%) participants exclusively breastfed their children for six months or more. The main reason for discontinuation of EBF was the requirement of women to return to paid employment (31.5%). Four-hundred and forty (98.2%) participants believed that breastfeeding has benefits either to the infant or to the mother. Three hundred and seventy-one (82.8%) of the participants received support from their family at home to assist with EBF, most commonly from their husbands and mothers. Having family support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.1, 95%, CI 1.2-3.6; P = 0.005), having frequent breaks at work (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI, 1.4-4.8; P = 0.002) and the possibility of buying or borrowing required equipment for expressing breast milk (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.0-3.0; P = 0.033) were statistically associated with an increased chance of EBF.Although returning to work was reported by the study participants as the main reason for discontinuation of EBF, families and managers' support play significant roles in EBF continuation, which in the absence of six-month's maternity leave for employed women in Ethiopia would be of benefit to both mothers and children."
https://openalex.org/W3185648293,"Newer data platforms offer increased opportunity to share multidimensional health data with research participants, but the preferences of participants for which data to receive and how is evolving. Our objective is to describe the preferences and expectations of participants for the return of individual research results within Project Baseline Health Study (PBHS). The PBHS is an ongoing, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study with data from four initial enrollment sites. PBHS participants are recruited from the general population along with groups enriched for heart disease and cancer disease risk. Cross-sectional data on return of results were collected in 2017-2018 from an (1) in-person enrollment survey (n = 1,890), (2) benchmark online survey (n = 1,059), and (3) participant interviews (n = 21). The main outcomes included (1) preferences for type of information to be added next to returned results, (2) participant plans for sharing returned results with a non-study clinician, and (3) choice to opt-out of receiving genetic results. Results were compared by sociodemographic characteristics. Enrollment and benchmark survey respondents were 57.1% and 53.5% female, and 60.0% and 66.2% white, respectively. Participants preferred the following data types be added to returned results in the future: genetics (29.9%), heart imaging, (16.4%), study watch (15.8%), and microbiome (13.3%). Older adults (OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87) were less likely to want their genetic results returned next. Forty percent of participants reported that they would not share all returned results with their non-study clinicians. Black (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.95) and Asian (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.73) participants were less likely, and older participants more likely (OR 1.45-1.61), to plan to share all results with their clinician than their counterparts. At enrollment, 5.8% of participants opted out of receiving their genetics results. The study showed that substantial heterogeneity existed in participant's preferences and expectations for return of results, and variations were related to sociodemographic characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3185811648,"Water mites are diverse aquatic invertebrates that provide potentially important ecosystem and economic services as bioindicators and mosquito biocontrol; however, little is known about water mite digestive physiology, including their diet in nature. Water mites, much like their spider relatives, liquefy their prey upon consumption. This results in the absence of morphologically identifiable prey in water mite mid-gut. Previous studies have reported associations in the field of water mites with presumed prey and laboratory observations of water mites feeding on specific organisms offered for ingestion; however, the present work aims to determine what water mites have ingested in nature based on molecular studies of gut contents from freshly collected organisms from the field. To elucidate water mite prey, we used next-generation sequencing to detect diverse cytochrome oxidase I DNA barcode sequences of putative prey in the guts of 54 specimens comprising two species of Lebertia and a few specimens of Arrenurus (2) and Limnesia (1). To our knowledge this is the first molecular study of the diets of water mites as they feed in nature. While the presence of chironomid DNA confirmed previous observations of midge larvae as part of the diets of Lebertia, we also found the DNA of diverse organisms in all four species of water mites, including the DNA of mosquitoes in 6 specimens of Lebertia and a large number of previously unknown prey, especially from oligochaete worms. These studies thereby reveal a greater diversity of prey and a potentially broader significance than previously appreciated for water mites in aquatic food webs. Molecular studies like this can detect water mite predators of mosquito larvae and add knowledge of water mite predatory contributions to freshwater food webs."
https://openalex.org/W3183284562,"The natural convection boundary layer flow of a viscous incompressible fluid with temperature dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity in the presence of exothermic catalytic chemical reaction along a curved surface has been investigated. The governing non dimensional form of equations is solved numerically by using finite difference scheme. The numerical results of velocity profile, temperature distribution and mass concentration as well as for skin friction, heat transfer rate and mass transfer rate are presented graphically and in tabular form for various values of dimensionless parameters those are generated in flow model during dimensionalization. From the obtained results, it is concluded that the exothermic catalytic chemical reactions is associated with temperature dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity. Further, it is concluded that the body shape parameter also plays an important quantitative role for change in velocity profile, temperature field and mass concentration behavior in the presence of exothermic catalytic chemical reaction."
https://openalex.org/W3184744693,"Epidemics such as COVID-19 and corresponding containment measures are assumed to cause psychological stress. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n = 1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced high levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. Thus, we conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms that lead to stress. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e., state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. Our findings indicate that containment measures increase worries and stress, especially for those who feel that these measures either are not sufficient or go too far. Thus, highlighting positive aspects of the crisis and convincing people of the effectiveness and necessity of mitigation measures can, not only promote compliance, but also reduce stress. Our model suggests that people who feel protected by the authorities have fewer worries, which can, in turn, limit the negative impact of the crisis on mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3185875921,"The changing forest disturbance regimes emphasize the need for improved damage risk information. Here, our aim was to (1) improve the current understanding of snow damage risks by assessing the importance of abiotic factors, particularly the modelled snow load on trees, versus forest properties in predicting the probability of snow damage, (2) produce a snow damage probability map for Finland. We also compared the results for winters with typical snow load conditions and a winter with exceptionally heavy snow loads. To do this, we used damage observations from the Finnish national forest inventory (NFI) to create a statistical snow damage occurrence model, spatial data layers from different sources to use the model to predict the damage probability for the whole country in 16 x 16 m resolution. Snow damage reports from forest owners were used for testing the final map. Our results showed that best results were obtained when both abiotic and forest variables were included in the model. However, in the case of the high snow load winter, the model with only abiotic predictors performed nearly as well as the full model and the ability of the models to identify the snow damaged stands was higher than in other years. The results showed patterns of forest adaptation to high snow loads, as spruce stands in the north were less susceptible to damage than in southern areas and long-term snow load reduced the damage probability. The model and the derived wall-to-wall map were able to discriminate damage from no-damage cases on a good level (AUC > 0.7). The damage probability mapping approach identifies the drivers of snow disturbances across forest landscapes and can be used to spatially estimate the current and future disturbance probabilities in forests, informing practical forestry and decision-making and supporting the adaptation to the changing disturbance regimes."
https://openalex.org/W3187035687,"The source of bacterial infection in neutropenic acute leukemia patients is detected in about 20-30% of cases. Bacterial cultures may require a long incubation period and risk false-positive and false- negative results. Therefore, biomarkers distinguishing septic febrile neutropenia from other etiologies in acute leukemia patients play the important role in patient assessment and treatment planning. This study aims to determine the role of procalcitonin (PCT) and presepsin (PSPN) in infectious complication in comparison to C-reactive protein (CRP) on the first and third day at the onset of febrile neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia.Between June 2018 and February 2019, 60 acute leukemia patients with febrile neutropenia receiving chemotherapy. The 41 acute myeloid leukemia patients and 19 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were recruited in this study. Their ages ranged from 14 to 65 years. PCT and PSPN were measured and were compared to CRP at the onset of febrile neutropenia and after 48 hours. 20 patients had a fever of unknown origin (FUO) and 40 patients had a bacterial infection.Our results showed that the values of these markers were higher in patients with infection than patients without. The area under the curve (AUC) of PCT were 0.931 and 0.813 on day one and three respectively, which was the best in determination of infection. The cut-off values of PCT were 1.27 and 1.23 ng/mL and the cut off values of PSPN were 1.75 and 2.9 μg/L in the successive days, their clinical sensitivities were high. PCT and PSPN were capable of distinguishing the cause of febrile neutropenia from the onset of infection and predicting its complications (p<0.05). The PSPN level couldn't differentiate gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial infection. Significant differences were found between the mean values of the PSPN during the successive days in all patients and patients with bacteremia. This study illustrated a weak positive correlation between PCT and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the negligible correlation between CRP and SOFA score and no significant correlation between PSPN and SOFA score.PCT is an accurate biomarker in identifying infection in acute leukemia patients, its concentration is associated with the severity of bacterial sepsis. PSPN is superior to PCT for follow-up of patients."

Methods This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 and 08/31/20 and followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients that were subsequently hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on the month of hospitalization. We summarized our findings through descriptive statistics. We used Cuzick’s Trend Test to examine any differences in the distribution of our study variables across the six months. Results During our study period, we identified 43,267 patients with COVID-19. A total of 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 13.1% (N = 1,081) died within 30 days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the proportion of patients that died consistently declined from 24.8% (N = 221/890) in March to 8.0% (N = 111/1,396) in August. Patients hospitalized in March compared to August were younger on average, mostly black, urban-dwelling, febrile and dyspneic. They also had a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to present with abnormal laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated creatinine. Lastly, there was a decline from March to August in receipt of mechanical ventilation (31.4% to 13.1%) and hydroxychloroquine (55.3% to &lt;1.0%), while treatment with dexamethasone (3.7% to 52.4%) and remdesivir (1.1% to 38.9%) increased. Conclusion Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we observed a trend towards decreased disease severity and mortality over time."
https://openalex.org/W3183872394,"The Maldives tuna fishery landings in 2018 were 148, 000 t and accounted for nearly a quarter of the global pole-and-line tuna catch. This fishery partially relies on a network of 55 anchored fish aggregating devices (AFADs) deployed around the archipelago. About one-third of the total pole-and-line tuna catch is harvested at AFADs. Although the AFAD fishery has existed for 35 years, knowledge on the behaviour of tuna in the AFAD array is still limited, precluding the development of science-based fishery management. In this study, local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers was used to improve our understanding of tuna behaviour, through personal interviews of 54 pole-and-line fishers from different parts of the archipelago. Interview results suggest that during the northeast monsoon tuna are more abundant on the eastern side of the Maldives, while during the southwest monsoon they are more abundant on the western side of the Maldives. Most fishers believed that tuna tend to stay at the AFADs for 3 to 6 days and remain within 2 miles from the AFADs when they are associated. Fishers believe that strong currents is the main factor for tuna departure from AFADs, though high sea surface temperatures and stormy conditions were also thought to contribute to departures. Moderate currents are believed to be a favourable condition to form aggregations at the AFADs while other factors such as suitable temperature, prey and attractants enhance this aggregation. Fishers also believe that there are multiple schools segregated according to size and species at AFADs and that catchability is higher at dawn and in the late afternoon when the tuna occur shallower in the water column. This study is an important step towards engaging the Maldivian tuna fishers into a science-based fishery management."

A total of 203 non-repetitive isolates were characterised using genus/species-specific PCRs and the identified isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing. The production of AmpC beta-lactamases was evaluated using cefoxitin disc, confirmed by the D96C detection test and their encoding genes detected by PCR. The D64C extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) test was also performed to appraise ESBLs/AmpC co-production. The genetic fingerprints of AmpC beta-lactamase producers were determined by ERIC-PCR. A total of 116 isolates were identified as E. coli (n = 65), Shigella spp. (n = 36) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 15). Ciprofloxacin resistance (44.4-55.4%) was the most frequent and resistance against the Cephem antibiotics ranged from 15-43.1% for E. coli, 25-36.1% for Shigella spp., and 20-40% for K. pneumoniae. On the other hand, these bacteria strains were most sensitive to Amikacin (0%), Meropenem (2.8%) and Piperacillin-Tazobactam (6.7%) respectively. Nineteen (16.4%) isolates comprising 16 E. coli and 3 Shigella spp. were confirmed as AmpC beta-lactamase producers. However, only E. coli isolates possessed the corresponding resistance determinants: blaACC (73.7%, n = 14), blaCIT (26%, n = 5), blaDHA (11%, n = 2) and blaFOX (16%, n = 3). Thirty-four (27.3%) Enterobacteriaceae strains were confirmed as ESBL producers and a large proportion (79.4%, n = 27) harboured the blaTEM gene, however, only two were ESBLs/AmpC co-producers. Genetic fingerprinting of the AmpC beta-lactamase-producing E. coli isolates revealed low similarity between isolates. In conclusion, the findings indicate the presence of AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from cattle, beef products and hospital environments that commonly harbour the associated resistance determinants especially the blaACC gene, nonetheless, there is limited possible cross-contamination between these environments."
https://openalex.org/W3184013415,"Background and purpose Stroke is the leading cause of neurological impairment in the South American Andean region. However, the epidemiology of stroke in the region has been poorly characterized. Methods We conducted a staged three-phase population-based study applying a validated eight-question neurological survey in 80 rural villages in Tumbes, northern Peru, then confirmed presence or absence of stroke through a neurologist’s examination to estimate the prevalence of stroke. Results Our survey covered 90% of the population (22,278/24,854 individuals, mean age 30±21.28, 48.45% females), and prevalence of stroke was 7.05/1,000 inhabitants. After direct standardization to WHO’s world standard population, adjusted prevalence of stroke was 6.94/1,000 inhabitants. Participants aged ≥85 years had higher stroke prevalence (&gt;50/1000 inhabitants) compared to other stratified ages, and some unusual cases of stroke were found among individuals aged 25–34 years. The lowest age reported for a first stroke event was 16.8 years. High blood pressure (aPR 4.2 [2.7–6.4], p&gt;0 . 001 ), and sedentary lifestyle (aPR 1.6 [1.0–2.6], p = 0 . 045 ) were more prevalent in people with stroke. Conclusions The age-standardized prevalence of stroke in this rural coastal Peruvian population was slightly higher than previously reported in studies from surrounding rural South American settings, but lower than in rural African and Asian regions. The death rate from stroke was much higher than in industrialized and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3184732153,"Does the “ideal” organization exist? Or do different workplace attributes attract different people? And if so, what attributes attract what types of employees? This study combines person-organization fit theory and a policy capturing methodology to determine (a) which attributes are the strongest predictors of perceived organization attractiveness in a sample of Australian job seekers, and (b) whether the magnitude of these predictive effects varies as a function of job seekers’ personal values. The design of this study is a randomized experiment of Australian job seekers who responded to an online survey invitation. Each of the 400 respondents received a random subset of 8 of 64 possible descriptions of organizations. Each description presented an organization that scored either high or low on six attributes based on the Employer Attractiveness Scale: economic, development, interest, social, application, and environmental value. Multi-level modelling revealed that all six attributes positively predicted job seekers’ ratings of organization attractiveness, with the three strongest predictors being social, environmental, and application value. Moderation analyses revealed that participants with strong self-transcendent or weak self-enhancement values were most sensitive to the absence of social, environmental, and application value in workplaces, down-rating organizations that scored low on these attributes. Our results demonstrate how job seekers’ personal values shape preferences for different types of workplaces. Organizations may be able to improve recruitment outcomes by matching working conditions to the personal values of workers they hope to employ."
https://openalex.org/W3183336689,"Background As healthcare-related data proliferate, there is need to annotate them expertly for the purposes of personalized medicine. Crowdworking is an alternative to expensive expert labour. Annotation corresponds to diagnosis, so comparing unlabeled records to labeled ones seems more appropriate for crowdworkers without medical expertise. We modeled the comparison of a record to two other records as a triplet annotation task, and we conducted an experiment to investigate to what extend sensor-measured stress, task duration, uncertainty of the annotators and agreement among the annotators could predict annotation correctness. Materials and methods We conducted an annotation experiment on health data from a population-based study. The triplet annotation task was to decide whether an individual was more similar to a healthy one or to one with a given disorder. We used hepatic steatosis as example disorder, and described the individuals with 10 pre-selected characteristics related to this disorder. We recorded task duration, electro-dermal activity as stress indicator, and uncertainty as stated by the experiment participants ( n = 29 non-experts and three experts) for 30 triplets. We built an Artificial Similarity-Based Annotator (ASBA) and compared its correctness and uncertainty to that of the experiment participants. Results We found no correlation between correctness and either of stated uncertainty, stress and task duration. Annotator agreement has not been predictive either. Notably, for some tasks, annotators agreed unanimously on an incorrect annotation. When controlling for Triplet ID, we identified significant correlations, indicating that correctness, stress levels and annotation duration depend on the task itself. Average correctness among the experiment participants was slightly lower than achieved by ASBA. Triplet annotation turned to be similarly difficult for experts as for non-experts. Conclusion Our lab experiment indicates that the task of triplet annotation must be prepared cautiously if delegated to crowdworkers. Neither certainty nor agreement among annotators should be assumed to imply correct annotation, because annotators may misjudge difficult tasks as easy and agree on incorrect annotations. Further research is needed to improve visualizations for complex tasks, to judiciously decide how much information to provide, Out-of-the-lab experiments in crowdworker setting are needed to identify appropriate designs of a human-annotation task, and to assess under what circumstances non-human annotation should be preferred."

https://openalex.org/W3183781972,"Building on previous research on the use of macroeconomic factors for conflict prediction and using data on political instability provided by the Political Instability Task Force, this article proposes two minimal forecasting models of political instability optimised to have the greatest possible predictive power for one-year and two-year event horizons, while still making predictions that are fully explainable. Both models employ logistic regression and use just three predictors: polity code (a measure of government type), infant mortality, and years of stability (i.e., years since the last instability event). These models make predictions for 176 countries on a country-year basis and achieve AUPRC's of 0.108 and 0.115 for the one-year and two-year models respectively. They use public data with ongoing availability so are readily reproducible. They use Monte Carlo simulations to construct confidence intervals for their predictions and are validated by testing their predictions for a set of reference years separate from the set of reference years used to train them. This validation shows that the models are not overfitted but suggests that some of the previous models in the literature may have been. The models developed in this article are able to explain their predictions by showing, for a given prediction, which predictors were the most influential and by using counterfactuals to show how the predictions would have been altered had these predictors taken different values. These models are compared to models created by lasso regression and it is shown that they have at least as good predictive power but that their predictions can be more readily explained. Because policy makers are more likely to be influenced by models whose predictions can explained, the more interpretable a model is the more likely it is to influence policy."
https://openalex.org/W3184092923,"Due to Hardware Trojan (HT), trustworthiness of Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain is a burning issue in Semiconductor Industry nowadays. Over the last decade, extensive research has been carried on HT detection methods for digital circuits. However, the HT issue remains largely unexplored in the domain of Analog Mixed Signal (AMS)/ RF circuit where it is now an appealing target for the attackers. The increasing popularity of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless cryptographic ICs in modern communication systems makes it a lucrative target for HT-based attacks which could have a devastating impact on data security. This paper presents a trigger-based Hardware Trojan Threat model that exploits the extended cyclic prefix (ECP) property of the OFDM communication scheme to leak the secret encryption key over low noise Additive White Gaussian Channel (AWGN) and developed a Cyclic Prefix (CP) checker based detection mechanism named ""SENTRY"" to detect such trojans once it is triggered."

The edge computing technology and GIS (Geographic Information Science) image data are combined from the perspective of sustainable development. A prediction model for the water resources in the irrigation area is constructed. With the goal of maximizing comprehensive benefits, the optimal allocation of water quality and quantity of water resources is determined. Finally, the actual effect of the model is verified through specific instance data in a province. Results demonstrate that the proposed irrigation area ecological prediction model based on edge computing and GIS images can provide better performance than other state of the art models on water resources prediction. Specifically, the accuracy can remain above 90%. The proposed model for ecological water demand prediction in the irrigation area and optimal allocation of water resources is based on the principle of quality water supply. The optimal allocation of water resources reveals the sustainable development ideas and the requirements of the optimal allocation model, which is very reasonable. The improvement of the system is effective and feasible, and the optimal allocation results are reasonable. This allocation model aims at the water quality and quantity conditions, water conservancy project conditions, and specific water demand requirements in the study area. The calculation results have great practicability and a strong guiding significance for the sustainable utilization and management of the irrigation area."
https://openalex.org/W3186048419,"Background Family history (FH) is one of important risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, little is known about its impact on dyslipidemia prevalence and management status. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of FH of CVD on dyslipidemia prevalence, awareness, treatment, control, and healthy behaviors in Korean adults. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using representative data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2014–2018. A total of 22,024 participants aged ≥ 19 years without histories of CVDs were classified into two groups according to the presence of FH of CVD (with FH, n = 3,778; without FH, n = 18,246). FH of CVD was defined as having a first-degree relative with ischemic heart disease or stroke. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between FH of CVD and dyslipidemia prevalence, awareness, treatment, control, and healthy behaviors (weight control, non-smoking, non-risky drinking, sufficient physical activity, and undergoing health screening). Results FH of CVD was significantly associated with a higher dyslipidemia prevalence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–1.51), better awareness (aOR 1.54, 95%CI 1.19–2.00), and treatment rates (aOR 1.34, 95%CI 1.12–1.60), but not control. Having an FH of CVD was not predictive of any healthy behaviors in dyslipidemia patients. For non-dyslipidemia patients, FH of CVD even showed significant association with smoking (aOR 1.18, 95%CI 1.02–1.36), and risky drinking (aOR 1.20, 95%CI 1.03–1.40) while it was predictive of receiving health screening (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02–1.27). Conclusions Having an FH of CVD might positively trigger dyslipidemia patients to start pharmacological intervention, but not non-pharmacological interventions. Therefore, physicians should make more efforts to educate and promote the importance of non-pharmacological behavioral modification in dyslipidemia patients with an FH of CVD."
https://openalex.org/W3186804670,"Strict endosymbiont bacteria present high degree genome reduction, retain smaller proteins, and in some instances, lack complete functional domains compared to free-living counterparts. Until now, the mechanisms underlying these genetic reductions are not well understood. In this study, the conservation of RNA polymerases, the essential machinery for gene expression, is analyzed in endosymbiont bacteria with extreme genome reductions. We analyzed the RNA polymerase subunits to identify and define domains, subdomains, and specific amino acids involved in precise biological functions known in Escherichia coli. We also perform phylogenetic analysis and three-dimensional models over four lineages of endosymbiotic proteobacteria with the smallest genomes known to date: Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola, Candidatus Tremblaya phenacola, Candidatus Tremblaya Princeps, Candidatus Nasuia deltocephalinicola, and Candidatus Carsonella ruddii. We found that some Hodgkinia strains do not encode for the RNA polymerase α subunit. The rest encode genes for α, β, β', and σ subunits to form the RNA polymerase. However, 16% shorter, on average, respect their orthologous in E. coli. In the α subunit, the amino-terminal domain is the most conserved. Regarding the β and β' subunits, both the catalytic core and the assembly domains are the most conserved. However, they showed compensatory amino acid substitutions to adapt to changes in the σ subunit. Precisely, the most erosive diversity occurs within the σ subunit. We identified broad amino acid substitution even in those recognizing and binding to the -10-box promoter element. In an overall conceptual image, the RNA polymerase from Candidatus Nasuia conserved the highest similarity with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and their σ70. It might be recognizing the two main promoter elements (-10 and -35) and the two promoter accessory elements (-10 extended and UP-element). In Candidatus Carsonella, the RNA polymerase could recognize all the promoter elements except the -10-box extended. In Candidatus Tremblaya and Hodgkinia, due to the α carboxyl-terminal domain absence, they might not recognize the UP-promoter element. We also identified the lack of the β flap-tip helix domain in most Hodgkinia's that suggests the inability to bind the -35-box promoter element."
https://openalex.org/W3125498057,"The Islamic headscarf has been in the middle of heated debates in European society, yet little is known about its influence on day-to-day interactions. The aim of this randomized field experiment (n = 840) is to explore how the generally negative views that surround the hijab in Europe manifest in the behavior that people direct to hijab-wearing women in everyday situations. Using a helping scenario and videotapes of the resulting interactions, we measured whether passengers offered assistance and also various details of behavior that indicate interpersonal involvement. We predicted that in interaction with the covered confederate less help would be offered, that women's level of nonverbal involvement would increase but men's decrease, and that responses would be stronger in Paris, intermediate in Brussels, and weaker in Vienna. We analyzed the data using Generalized Linear Models estimated with Bayesian inference. While the headscarf does not produce concluding differences in ""overt"" helping, it does affect ""subtle"" cues of interpersonal involvement. In response to the hijab, women across sites increase, but men in Paris decrease, the level of involvement that they show with their nonverbal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3184520290,"Background Although people living with HIV in Côte d’Ivoire receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) at no cost, other out-of-pocket (OOP) spending related to health can still create a barrier to care. Methods A convenience sample of 400 adults living with HIV for at least 1 year in Côte d’Ivoire completed a survey on their health spending for HIV and chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In addition to descriptive statistics, we performed simple linear regression analyses with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Findings 365 participants (91%) reported OOP spending for HIV care, with a median of $16/year (IQR 5–48). 34% of participants reported direct costs with a median of $2/year (IQR 1–41). No participants reported user fees for HIV services. 87% of participants reported indirect costs, with a median of $17/year (IQR 7–41). 102 participants (26%) reported at least 1 NCD. Of these, 80 (78%) reported OOP spending for NCD care, with a median of $50/year (IQR 6–107). 76 participants (95%) with both HIV and NCDs reported direct costs, and 48% reported paying user fees for NCD services. Participants had missed a median of 2 HIV appointments in the past year (IQR 2–3). Higher OOP costs were not associated with the number of HIV appointments missed. 21% of participants reported spending over 10% of household income on HIV and/or NCD care. Discussion and conclusions Despite the availability of free ART, most participants reported OOP spending. OOP costs were much higher for participants with co-morbid NCDs."
https://openalex.org/W3184881799,"The pathophysiology of dry eye disease (DED) remains largely unknown, accounting in part for the lack of successful treatments. We explored the pathophysiology of DED using a rabbit model of chronic DED induced with 3 weekly injections of Concanavalin A into the periorbital lacrimal glands. The transcriptome of full-thickness's conjunctival tissue from rabbits with DED and from normal controls was determined using microarrays and, as needed, confirmatory real-time polymerase chain reactions. Results were subjected to bioinformatic analysis. DED induced large-scale changes in gene transcription involving 5,184 genes (22% of the total). Differentially expressed genes could be segregated into: functional modules and clusters; altered pathways; functionally linked genes; and groups of individual genes of known or suspected pathophysiological relevance to DED. A common feature of these subgroups is the breadth and magnitude of the changes that encompass ocular immunology and essentially all aspects of cell biology. Prominent changes concerned innate and adaptive immune responses; ocular surface inflammation; at least 25 significantly altered signaling pathways; a large number of chemokines; cell cycle; and apoptosis. Comparison of our findings to the limited extant transcriptomic data from DED patients associated with either Sjogren's syndrome or non-Sjogren's etiologies revealed a significant correlation between human and rabbit DED transcriptomes. Our data, establishing the large-scale transcriptomic changes of DED and their potential similarity to the human, underscore the enormous complexity of DED; establish a robust animal model of DED; will help expand our understanding of its pathophysiology; and could guide the development of successful therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3184918577,"Myopia is increasing worldwide hence it exists a pressing demand to find effective myopia control strategies. Previous studies have shown that light, spectral composition, spatial frequencies, and contrasts play a critical role in refractive development. The effects of light on multiple retinal processes include growth regulation, but also visual performance and perception. Changes in subjective visual performance can be examined by contrast sensitivity (CS). This study was conducted to investigate whether retinal light stimulation of different wavelength ranges is able to elicit changes in CS and, therefore, may be used for myopia control purposes. In total, 30 right eyes were stimulated with the light of different wavelength ranges, including dominant wavelengths of ∼480 nm, ∼530 nm, ∼630 nm and polychromatic light via a commercial liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. Stimulation was performed screen full-field and on the optic nerve head only. CS was measured before any stimulation and after each stimulation condition using a novel and time-efficient CS test. Post-stimulation CS changes were analyzed by ANOVA regarding the influencing factors spatial frequency, stimulation wavelength and stimulation location. A priorly conducted verification study on a subset of five participants compared the newly developed CS test to a validated CS test. The novel CS test exhibited good reliability of 0.94 logCS and repeatability of 0.13 logCS with a duration of 92 sec ± 17 sec. No clinically critical change between pre- and post-stimulation CS was detected (all p>0.05). However, the results showed that post-stimulation CS differed significantly at 18 cpd after stimulation with polychromatic light from short-wavelength light (p<0.0001). Location of illumination (screen full-field vs. optic nerve head) or any interactions with other factors did not reveal significant influences (all p>0.05). To summarize, a novel CS test measures the relationship between retinal light stimulation and CS. However, using retinal illumination via LCD screens to increase CS is inconclusive."
https://openalex.org/W3185314079,"We recently showed that the gut microbiota composition of stunted children was different from that of children with normal nutritional status. Here, we compared immune status and fecal microbial metabolite concentrations between stunted and normal children, and we correlated macronutrient intake (including energy), metabolites and immune status to microbiota composition. The results show that macronutrient intake was lower in stunted children for all components, but after correction for multiple comparison significant only for energy and fat. Only TGF-β was significantly different between stunted children and children of normal nutritional status after correction for multiple comparisons. TNF-alpha, IL-10, lipopolysaccharide binding protein in serum and secretory IgA in feces were not significantly different. Strikingly, all the individual short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids were higher in fecal samples of stunted children (significant for acetate, valerate and total SCFA). These metabolites correlated with a number of different microbial taxa, but due to extensive cross-feeding between microbes, did not show a specific pattern. However, the energy-loss due to higher excretion in stunted children of these metabolites, which can be used as substrate for the host, is striking. Several microbial taxa also correlated to the intake of macronutrients (including dietary fibre) and energy. Eisenbergiella positively correlated with all macronutrients, while an uncharacterized genus within the Succinivibrionaceae family negatively correlated with all macronutrients. These, and the other correlations observed, may provide indication on how to modulate the gut microbiota of stunted children such that their growth lag can be corrected.

https://openalex.org/W3185788157,We propose in this paper a general class of nonlinear beta regression models with measurement errors. The motivation for proposing this model arose from a real problem we shall discuss here. The application concerns a usual oil refinery process where the main covariate is the concentration of a typically measured in error reagent and the response is a catalyst’s percentage of crystallinity involved in the process. Such data have been modeled by nonlinear beta and simplex regression models. Here we propose a nonlinear beta model with the possibility of the chemical reagent concentration being measured with error. The model parameters are estimated by different methods. We perform Monte Carlo simulations aiming to evaluate the performance of point and interval estimators of the model parameters. Both results of simulations and the application favors the method of estimation by maximum pseudo-likelihood approximation.
https://openalex.org/W3185987025,"As adult height is linked to various health outcomes, further investigation of its causal effects on kidney function later in life is warranted. This study involved a cross-sectional observational analysis and summary-level Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. First, the observational association between height and estimated GFR determined by creatinine (eGFRcreatinine) or cystatin C (eGFRcystatinC) was investigated in 467,182 individuals aged 40-69 using UK Biobank. Second, the genetic instrument for adult height, as reported by the GIANT consortium, was implemented, and summary-level MR of eGFRcreatinine and CKDcreatinine in a CKDGen genome-wide association study was performed (N = 567,460), with multivariable MR being adjusted for the effects of genetic predisposition on body mass index. To replicate the findings, additional two-sample MR using the summary statistics of eGFRcystatinC and CKDcystatinC in UK Biobank was performed (N = 321,405). In observational analysis, adult height was inversely associated with both eGFRcreatinine (per 1 SD, adjusted beta -1.039, standard error 0.129, P < 0.001) and eGFRcystatinC (adjusted beta -1.769, standard error 0.161, P < 0.001) in a multivariable model adjusted for clinicodemographic, anthropometric, metabolic, and social factors. Moreover, multivariable summary-level MR showed that a taller genetically predicted adult height was causally linked to a lower log-eGFRcreatinine (adjusted beta -0.007, standard error 0.001, P < 0.001) and a higher risk of CKDcreatinine (adjusted beta 0.083, standard error 0.019, P < 0.001). Other pleiotropy-robust sensitivity MR analysis results supported the findings. In addition, similar results were obtained by two-sample MR of eGFRcystatinC (adjusted beta -1.303, standard error 0.140, P < 0.001) and CKDcystatinC (adjusted beta 0.153, standard error 0.025, P < 0.001) in UK Biobank. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that a taller adult height is causally linked to worse kidney function in middle-aged to elderly individuals, independent of the effect of body mass index."

Here we explore for the first time the genetic aetiology of MMS using whole-exome sequencing (WES) in undiagnosed patients from the Greek-Cypriot population after prior extensive diagnostics workup including karyotype and array-CGH. A total of 100 individuals (37 affected), from 32 families were recruited and family-based WES was applied to detect causative single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. A genetic diagnosis was reported for 16 MMS patients (43.2%), with 10/17 (58.8%) of the findings being novel. All autosomal dominant findings occurred de novo. Functional studies were also performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism relevant to the abnormal phenotypes, in cases where the clinical significance of the findings was unclear. The 17 variants identified in our cohort were located in 14 genes (PCNT, UBE3A, KAT6A, SPR, POMGNT1, PIEZO2, PXDN, KDM6A, PHIP, HECW2, TFAP2A, CNOT3, AGTPBP1 and GAMT). This study has highlighted the efficacy of WES through the high detection rate (43.2%) achieved for a challenging category of undiagnosed patients with MMS compared to other conventional diagnostic testing methods (10-20% for array-CGH and ~3% for G-banding karyotype analysis). As a result, family-based WES could potentially be considered as a first-tier cost effective diagnostic test for patients with MMS that facilitates better patient management, prognosis and offer accurate recurrence risks to the families."

The literature suggests participation in trauma research is not inherently harmful, and current recommendations concern using research to benefit communities and participants, protecting participants and researchers from harm, and improving professional practice. As public health researchers increasingly analyze trauma as a determinant of health, gold standards for the conduct of trauma-informed public health research would be appropriate and timely."
https://openalex.org/W3186965275,"Chemically defended prey often advertise their toxins with bright and conspicuous colors. To understand why such colors are effective at reducing predation, we need to understand the psychology of key predators. In bird predators, there is evidence that individuals avoid novelty-including prey of novel colors (with which they have had no prior experience). Moreover, the effect of novelty is sometimes strongest for colors that are typically associated with aposematic prey (e.g., red, orange, yellow). Given these findings in the bird literature, color neophobia has been argued to be a driving force in the evolution of aposematism. However, no studies have yet asked whether invertebrate predators respond similarly to novel colors. Here, we tested whether naive lab-raised jumping spiders (Habronattus pyrrithrix) exhibit similar patterns of color neophobia to birds. Using color-manipulated living prey, we first color-exposed spiders to prey of two out of three colors (blue, green, or red), with the third color remaining novel. After this color exposure phase, we gave the spiders tests where they could choose between all three colors (two familiar, one novel). We found that H. pyrrithrix attacked novel and familiar-colored prey at equal rates with no evidence that the degree of neophobia varied by color. Moreover, we found no evidence that either prey novelty nor color (nor their interaction) had an effect on how quickly prey was attacked. We discuss these findings in the context of what is known about color neophobia in other animals and how this contributes to our understanding of aposematic signals."

We used Cox regression and LASSO regression analysis to screen prognostic factors and constructed a risk score model. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was used to validate the model. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for mRNAs functional analysis. The cell composition of TILs was analyzed by the CIBERSORT algorithm, and Pearson correlation analysis was utilized to explore the correlation between TILs and prognostic factors.We constructed a ceRNA regulatory network composed of 67 nodes through WGCNA, including 44 DElncRNAs, 19 DEGs, and 4 DEmiRNAs. And based on the expression of 4 DEGs in this network (RRM2, LDLR, TXNIP, and KIF23), a prognostic model of HCC with good specificity and sensitivity was developed. CIBERSORT analyzed the composition of TILs in HCC tumor tissues. Correlation analysis showed that RRM2 is significantly correlated with T cells CD4 memory activated, T cells CD4 memory resting, T cells CD8, and T cells follicular helper, and TXNIP is negatively correlated with B cells memory.In this study, a ceRNA with prognostic value in HCC was created, and a prognostic risk model for HCC was constructed based on it. This risk score model is closely related to TILs and is expected to become a potential therapeutic target and a new predictive indicator."
https://openalex.org/W3184552242,"Creating biocatalysts for (R)-selective amination effectively is highly desirable in organic synthesis. Despite noticeable progress in the engineering of (R)-amine activity in pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent transaminases of fold type IV, the specialization of the activity is still an intuitive task, as there is poor understanding of sequence-structure-function relationships. In this study, we analyzed this relationship in transaminase from Thermobaculum terrenum, distinguished by expanded substrate specificity and activity in reactions with L-amino acids and (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine using α-ketoglutarate and pyruvate as amino acceptors. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to create a panel of the enzyme variants, which differ in the active site residues from the parent enzyme to a putative transaminase specific to (R)-primary amines. The variants were examined in the overall transamination reactions and half-reaction with (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine. A structural analysis of the most prominent variants revealed a spatial reorganization in the active sites, which caused changes in activity. Although the specialization to (R)-amine transaminase was not implemented, we succeeded in understanding the role of the particular active site residues in expanding substrate specificity of the enzyme. We showed that the specificity for (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine in transaminase from T. terrenum arises without sacrificing the specificity for L-amino acids and α-ketoglutarate and in consensus with it."
https://openalex.org/W3185659264,"The Glaucoma Stereo Analysis Study (GSAS) is a multicenter collaborative study of the characteristics of glaucomatous optic disc morphology using a stereo fundus camera. This study evaluated the retinal vessel calibers and correlations using GSAS fundus photographs between retinal vessels and 38 optic nerve head (ONH) morphologic parameters comprehensively. In all 240 eyes, the mean central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) were 138.4 and 216.5 μm, respectively; the CRAE correlated with age, visual field scores and 19 ONH parameters and CRVE correlated with age, intraocular pressure, visual field scores and 11 ONH parameters. Among the different optic disc appearances including focal ischemia (FI) (n = 53, 22%), generalized enlargement (GE) (n = 53, 22%), myopic glaucoma (MY) (n = 112, 47%), and senile sclerosis (SS) (n = 22, 9%), the CRAE did not differ significantly; CRVE was significantly narrower in SS than in FI and MY. In FI, GE, MY, and SS disc types, CRAE correlated with 3, 14, 9, and 2 ONH parameters, respectively, and CRVE corelated with 9, 0, 12, and 6 ONH parameters, respectively. We confirmed previous observations on the effect of retinal vessel narrowing on glaucomatous changes in the ONH and visual field. The associations between retinal vessel caliber and ONH morphologic parameters vary among different optic disc appearances, suggesting different effects of vascular changes in each disc type."
https://openalex.org/W3186230484,"The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of amblyopia risk factors in children visiting the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) using automated vision screening.This was a hospital-based screening of 1102 children aged between 2 and 6 years. Vision screening was performed using PlusoptiX S12 over 2 years (2018-2020). The need for referral to a pediatric ophthalmologist was based on the amblyopia risk factors set forth by the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. Referred patients underwent a comprehensive eye examination.A total of 1102 children were screened, 63 were referred for amblyopia risk factors (5.7%); 37/63 (59%) underwent comprehensive eye examination and 73% were prescribed glasses. Of the non-referred group of children, 6.35% had astigmatism, 6.25% were hyperopic and 3.27% were myopic. The refractive errors observed among the examined patients were distributed as follows: 41% astigmatism, 51% hyperopia, and 8% myopia; amblyopia was not detected. Refractive amblyopia risk factors were associated with the presence of systemic disorders. Bland-Altman plots showed most of the differences to be within limits of agreement.Using an automated vision screener in a hospital-based cohort of children aged 2 to 6 years, the rate of refractive amblyopia risk factors was 5.7%. Hyperopia was the most commonly encountered refractive error and children with systemic disorders were at higher risk."
https://openalex.org/W3186425307,"Protoceratids are an extinct family of endemic North American artiodactyls. The phylogenetic position of protoceratids in relation to camelids and ruminants has been contentious for over a century. The petrosal morphology of basal (Leptotragulus) and derived (Syndyoceras) protoceratids has suggested that protoceratids are closely related to ruminants, whereas a prior description of a disarticulated intermediate protoceratid petrosal (Protoceras celer) indicated that protoceratids were closely related to camelids. This contradictory evidence implied that there were several character reversals within the protoceratid lineage and brought into question the utility of basicranial characters in artiodactyl phylogenetics. Here, we provide descriptions of an additional P. celer petrosal. The descriptions are based on data produced by computed tomography scans, which allowed us to image the petrosal in situ in the skull. Our results indicate that the petrosal morphology of P. celer is similar to that of other protoceratids, implying that, contrary to previous evidence, petrosal morphology is conserved within the Protoceratidae."
https://openalex.org/W3186998754,"To support the rapidly expanding industrial hemp industry, a commercial supply of high-quality starter plants with low genetic variability from nurseries will be key to consistent and efficient cultivation efforts. Rooting success was evaluated across four propagation medias, five rooting hormones, and eight commercially available high-cannabidiol (CBD) essential oil hemp cultivars. Cuttings were placed in a climate-controlled room and assessed for rooting success 12 days after cloning. Rooting success was determined by quantifying total root number, cumulative total root length, and total root mass. Propagation media had the greatest effect on rooting success (13-80%). Rockwool had the highest rooting success resulting in 10-fold increases in rooting traits over the next highest scoring medium (Berger BM6). Hormone applications significantly improved (15- to 18-fold) rooting success compared to no hormone application, while non-statistical differences were observed across auxin hormone concentrations and application methods. Genetic variation in rooting response was observed between cultivars with 'Cherry Wine' outperforming all other cultivars with an approximate 20% increase in rooting success over the next highest rooting cultivar, 'Wife'. Although the ideal combination was not specifically identified in this study, findings provide insight into how rooting hormone application and medium selection impact vegetative propagule rooting success of essential oil hemp."
https://openalex.org/W3183497848,"Social cognition allows humans to understand and predict other people's behavior by inferring or sharing their emotions, intentions and beliefs. Few studies have investigated the impact of one's own emotional state on understanding others. Here, we tested the effect of being in an angry state on empathy and theory of mind (ToM). In a between-groups design we manipulated anger status with different paradigms in three studies (autobiographical recall (N = 45), negative feedback (N = 49), frustration (N = 46)) and checked how this manipulation affected empathic accuracy and performance in the EmpaToM. All paradigms were successful in inducing mild anger. We did not find the expected effect of anger on empathy or ToM performance but observed small behavioral changes. Together, our results validate the use of three different anger induction paradigms and speak for rather weak behavioral effects of mild state anger on empathy and ToM."
https://openalex.org/W3183972467,"Many physical and psychological characteristics are influenced by prenatal development. Some studies have located links between low birth parameters and behavioural problems, with the latter in turn associated with educational progress, career success, overall health, and subsequent life events. However, few studies have investigated whether this association also applies to children in the normal birth growth range. This study thus investigates the relationship between normal-range birth length, weight, and behavioural problems at the age of seven. We use data from the Czech part of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC) cohort, which provides comprehensive insight into a post-communist country undergoing a period of economic transition. Childhood behavioural problems were measured in 1,796 children using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Associations were modelled using weighted logistic regression. Birth weight was found to be linked to the total difficulties score, hyperactivity, and peer relationship problems subscales in a fully adjusted model while birth length was not significantly associated with any subscale in the fully adjusted model. We thus conclude that normal-range birth weight is associated with behavioural problems. It can therefore be assumed that the odds of behavioural problems and their consequences can be mitigated by preventive programs targeting pregnant women and children with lower but still normal weight."
https://openalex.org/W3184668846,"Examining relationships of toddler abilities in attention, cognitive, motor, and language development, and behavioral problems, with distinct attention profiles at 6 years of age in children born moderate-to-late preterm and full term.Longitudinal study with a cohort of 88 moderate-to-late preterm and 83 full term born children. At 18 months attention abilities were assessed. At 24 months cognitive, motor, and language development was examined and behavioral problems were screened. At 6 years ten measures of attention were administered, which were used to classify children in one of four attentional functioning profiles (normal attention, overall poorer attention, poorer cognitive attention, and behavioral attention problems). Performance at 18 and 24 months was examined in relation to these four distinct attention profiles, as well as in relation to normal (first profile) versus subaverage attention (second, third, and fourth profiles) using multinomial logistic regressions.Orienting and alerting attention, and receptive language were related to distinct attention profiles. Specifically, children with an overall poorer attention profile at 6 years were differentiated by lower orienting attention and receptive language scores at toddler age, while those with a poorer cognitive attention profile showed lower early alerting attention at 18 months. Children with a behavioral attention problems profile at 6 years were differentiated by lower orienting attention but higher alerting attention scores at toddler age. Orienting attention and receptive language, but not alerting attention, at toddler age were related to normal versus subaverage attention, with lower scores predicting subaverage attention.Children at risk of poorer attentional functioning at school-age, expressed in distinct attention profiles, already showed differentiated functioning in attention abilities and in language comprehension as toddlers. Distinguishing distinct attention profiles could be important for future research and clinical practice, as is early monitoring of attention and language abilities in children at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3185810424,"Biodiversity conservation planning requires accurate, current information about species status and threats. Although introduced mammals are the greatest threat to seabirds globally, data on introduced species is lacking for many seabird breeding islands. To inform conservation planning, we used trail cameras to document the presence, relative abundance, and seasonal and diel attendance of introduced and native vertebrates within pink-footed shearwater (Ardenna creatopus) breeding colonies on Isla Mocha (five colonies, 2015-2020) and Isla Robinson Crusoe (Juan Fernández Archipelago), Chile (one colony, 2019-2020). The most commonly detected species were pink-footed shearwaters and introduced rats (Rattus spp.) on Isla Mocha, and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and pink-footed shearwaters on Isla Robinson Crusoe. Introduced mammals observed, in order of greatest catch-per-unit-effort, were rats, cats (Felis catus), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), and European hares (Lepus europaeus) on Isla Mocha and European rabbits, cats, cattle (Bos taurus), rats, dogs, mice (Mus musculus), and southern coati (Nasua nasua) on Isla Robinson Crusoe. Especially noteworthy results for pink-footed shearwater conservation were the presence of cats during all monitoring months in shearwater colonies on both islands, that catch-per-unit-effort of rabbits was greater than shearwaters on Isla Robinson Crusoe, and that rats were the most observed vertebrates after shearwaters on Isla Mocha. Pink-footed shearwaters were regularly present on the islands from October through May. Presence and relative catch-per-unit-effort of pink-footed shearwaters qualitatively matched the species' known breeding phenology. The regular presence and temporal overlap with shearwaters of cats, rats, rabbits, and cattle within shearwater colonies, coupled with the irregular presence of dogs, coati, hares, and mice, indicated a serious conservation threat for pink-footed shearwaters and other native insular fauna and flora. Finally, our study provides a widely applicable model for analysis of multi-year trail camera data collected with unstandardized settings."
