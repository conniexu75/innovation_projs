Incorporation of defined in vitro-generated ctx deletion mutations into Vibrio cholerae by in vivo genetic recombination produced strains which have practical value in cholera vaccine development.
https://openalex.org/W2094354143,"Almost 40,000 selected seventh-grade students from the Middle Atlantic region of the United States took the College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test as part of the Johns Hopkins regional talent search in 1980, 1981, and 1982. A separate nationwide talent search was conducted in which any student under age 13 who was willing to take the test was eligible. The results obtained by both procedures establish that by age 13 a large sex difference in mathematical reasoning ability exists and that it is especially pronounced at the high end of the distribution: among students who scored greater than or equal to 700, boys outnumbered girls 13 to 1. Some hypothesized explanations of such differences were not supported by the data."

The diploid gynogenones, activated by the male gamete which was then removed, developed at best to about the 25-somite stage as did the genetically similar diploid parthenogenones stimulated to develop in the complete absence of the male gamete. The failure of development to term in both cases may be due to homozygosity and does not appear to be due to a lack of extragenetic contribution from spermatozoa."
https://openalex.org/W2062957366,"A synthetic heptapeptide from the amino terminus of the beta chain in human fibrin was used as an antigen to produce monoclonal antibodies that bind to fibrin even in the presence of human fibrinogen at the concentration found in plasma. As expected, the antifibrin activity was inhibited by the peptide antigen but not by a control heptapeptide. In a chicken ex vivo circulatory model for fibrin detection, intravenously administered monoclonal antibodies bound to human fibrin-coated disks placed in an extracorporeal chamber. These findings may lead to better methods for identifying deep vein and coronary artery thrombi."

The peptides were arginine- and cystine-rich and lacked free sulfhydryl groups and detectable levels of carbohydrate. Complete sequence determinations revealed that MCP-1 differed from MCP-2 only by the substitution of arginine for leucine at residue 13 from the NH2 terminus and that the molecules were each single chain polypeptides of 33 amino acid residues containing three intramolecular disulfide bonds. The complete amino acid sequences of MCP-1 and MCP-2 are: (sequence in text)"

https://openalex.org/W1927705072,"We have studied the ionic strength-dependent change in conformation of fibronectin, half-molecules of fibronectin produced by reduction and carboxyamidomethylation, and proteolytic fragments. In zone sedimentation through glycerol gradients, intact fibronectin sedimented at 13.5 and 10 S in 0.02 and 0.2 M NaCl, respectively, in agreement with previous studies. Half-molecules sedimented at 11.5 and 7.5 S in the two salt concentrations, demonstrating that the change in conformation occurs independently within each half-molecule. Gelatin-binding plasmic fragments of 165-215 kDa showed a similar large shift in sedimentation coefficient, and one of 60 kDa showed a small shift. We conclude that the change in conformation is effected by short range electrostatic interactions along the strand, rather than by attraction of distant segments of the molecule. Electron microscopy showed that both intact fibronectin and half-molecules exist as extended strands at high ionic strength. At low ionic strength the strands are more strongly curved or bent to produce an irregularly coiled compact structure. No regular points of folding or crossover were seen, suggesting that the compact conformation is produced by increased bending over most or all of the strand."
https://openalex.org/W1575733808,"Intramolecular isotope effects were determined for the N-demethylation of N-methyl-N-trideuteriomethylaniline catalyzed by two isozymes of cytochrome P-450 and several peroxidases in order to differentiate between deprotonation and hydrogen atom abstraction steps. Lactoperoxidase, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and two isozymes of horseradish peroxidase catalyzed the hydroperoxide-dependent N-demethylation at initial rates ranging from 20 to 1700 min-1. These hemeproteins exhibited large and comparable intramolecular isotope effects (kH/kD = 8.6 to 10.1). In contrast, two isozymes of cytochrome P-450 as well as chloroperoxidase (v = 1.5 to 1700 min-1) gave low isotope effects (kH/kD = 1.7 to 3.1) under identical conditions. Catalase exhibited an intermediate intramolecular isotope effect (kH/kD = 5.4). These results have been interpreted to indicate that most of the hemeproteins investigated catalyze N-demethylation reactions via alpha-carbon hydrogen atom abstraction, while the reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 and chloroperoxidase proceed via alpha-carbon deprotonation."
https://openalex.org/W1499432418,"Fiber type transformation was induced in fast skeletal muscles of the rabbit by chronic electrical stimulation of the motor nerve. The accompanying changes in myosin subunit composition were examined in order to establish the precise sequence of events during this transition. Replacement of the fast by the slow isoforms of the individual light and heavy chains of the native myosin did not occur synchronously. The resultant changes in the stoichiometry of the different classes of light chains are described in relation to possible mechanisms regulating the expression of the corresponding genes. The neonatal form of myosin could not be detected at any stage of transformation, suggesting that the changes in myosin synthesis do not recapitulate the developmental sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1515357074,"The binding region of immunoglobulins, which includes the portion of the molecule having the most variability in its amino acid sequence, is shown to have a surprisingly constant structure that can be characterized in terms of a simple, well-defined model. The binding region is composed of the antigen combining site plus its immediate vicinity and arises by noncovalent association of the light and heavy chain variable domains (VL and VH, respectively). The antigen combining site itself consists of six polypeptide chain segments (hypervariable loops) which comprise some 80 amino acid residues and are attached to a framework of VL and VH beta-sheet bilayers. Having analyzed refined x-ray crystallographic coordinates for three antigen-binding fragments (Fab KOL (Marquart, M., Deisenhofer, J., and Huber, R. (1980) J. Mol. Biol. 141, 369-391), MCPC 603 (Segal, D., Padlan, E. A., Cohen, G. H., Rudikoff, S., Potter, M., and Davies, D. R. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71, 4298-4302), and NEW (Saul, F. A., Amzel, L. M., and Poljak, R. J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 585-597] we use the results to introduce a general model for the VL-VH interface forming the binding region. The region consists of two closely packed beta-sheets, and its geometry corresponds to a 9-stranded, cylindrical barrel of average radius 0.84 nm with an average angle of -53 degrees between its two constituent beta-sheets. The barrel forms the bottom and sides of the antigen combining site. The model demonstrates that the structural variability of the binding region is considerably less than was thought previously. Amino acid residues which are part of the domain-domain interface and appear not to be accessible to solvent or antigen contribute to antibody specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1493150376,"The kinetics of the reaction between human thrombin and antithrombin III were studied in the presence of heparin fractionated according to its molecular size and affinity for antithrombin III. Reactions were monitored continuously through the loss of fluorescence intensity accompanying the displacement of the reversible inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide from thrombin upon its interaction with antithrombin III. As the concentration of heparin was increased in the presence of fixed concentrations of the two proteins, initial rates of the reaction increased up to a maximum and then decreased. Both the maximum rate and the concentration of heparin required to obtain a maximum increased with increased concentration of the proteins. The reaction appeared second order overall and first order with respect to each protein when heparin was in excess and zero order overall when the proteins were in excess. The existence of zero order kinetics at excess concentration of proteins indicates that the reaction is saturable in both proteins. The kinetics of the heparin-catalyzed reaction measured over an appreciable range of protein and heparin concentrations could be rationalized well by the simple rate equation, v = k X fa X fb X [H]t, where k is an intrinsic rate constant for the reaction between bound antithrombin III and thrombin, fa and fb are, respectively, the fractional saturation of available sites on heparin by antithrombin III and thrombin, and [H]t is the total concentration of heparin. This rate equation implies that interactions of both proteins with heparin are involved in the expression of catalytic activity through a template mechanism as proposed by M. W. Pomeranz and W. G. Owen ((1978) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 535, 66-77) and M. J. Griffith ((1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7360-7365)."
https://openalex.org/W2086994939,"Secretory antibodies of the IgA class (sIgA) are thought to have an important role in the defence against bacteria at mucosal surfaces--the level at which the infectious agents first come into contact with the host. However, the mechanism by which sIgA exert their antibacterial activity is still a matter of debate. After the recent discovery of receptors for the Fc portion of IgA (RFc alpha) on lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes of human, rabbit, guinea pig and mouse origin, it has been hypothesized that IgA also mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Indeed, ADCC mediated by human leukocytes against bacteria has been demonstrated in the presence of human circulating IgA. As RFc alpha have also been shown to bind sIgA, we decided to investigate whether sIgA could mediate antibacterial ADCC when bound to lymphocytes from the murine gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) which first interact with the invading bacteria. By using Shigella X16 (a hybrid strain between the enteric pathogen Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli) as target in an in vitro assay that measures cell-mediated antibacterial responses, we found that murine lymphocytes from GALT but not from other tissues are able to exert natural antibacterial activity against Shigella X16, and that sIgA significantly and specifically increase the natural antibacterial activity of GALT lymphocytes from mice and induce antibacterial activity in cells from the spleen, but not from the thymus or popliteal lymph nodes. Thus, we now propose a new role for sIgA in protecting the host against infectious agents at the mucosal level."

https://openalex.org/W1499411251,"Fibronectin has been purified to apparent homogeneity according to measurements of molecular weight and diffusion constant from light scattering and sedimentation in the analytical ultracentrifuge. This gives two estimates of molecular weight close to 500,000. (The difference with the gel electrophoretic value of 440,000 may indicate the presence of some material of molecular weight higher than that of the monomer.) The (corrected) diffusion constant is found to decrease with ionic strength, much more rapidly in 30% glycerol than in water. A corresponding change occurs when the glycerol content is varied from 0 to 30% at moderate ionic strength, but at very low ionic strength the diffusion constant does not depend on glycerol content. It is concluded that fibronectin can occur in two extreme conformations: the open form, in 30% glycerol at moderate ionic strength, should correspond to the extended shapes visualized by others by electron microscopy of samples prepared from solutions containing glycerol, while the closed form occurs under more physiological conditions. The Stokes radii of these forms, 14.5 and 9.6 nm, respectively, have been compared with calculated Stokes radii of chains of beads of overall length 140 nm having varying stiffness, simulated by a Monte Carlo procedure. These have a Stokes radius of 14.5 nm when made relatively extended to where the distance between chain ends averages 90 nm, as observed in the electron micrographs. When these chains are made very flexible, the Stokes radius reaches a limit of about 10 nm, apparently a lower limit to which a randomly coiled molecule of this size and volume may collapse in a disordered fashion. These results and electron micrographs obtained at low ionic strength suggest a tangled model of the compact form, rather than the ordered model recently proposed by others. Finally, some speculation is offered in regard to a possible physiological role of a conformation change of fibronectin."

https://openalex.org/W1498346306,"Primary cultures of estrogen-induced chick parenchymal liver cells have been used to study the assembly of the apolipoprotein and glycerolipid constituents of hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Liver cell monolayers in serum-free medium were pulse-labeled for 2.5 min with either [3H]leucine or [3H]glycerol and were then chased for 4 h. The kinetics of secretion of VLDL 3H-apolipoproteins (labeled from [3H]leucine) and [3H]triacylglycerol and 3H-phosphoglycerides (labeled from [3H]glycerol) was determined through the chase. Maximal rates of VLDL [3H]triacylglycerol secretion were reached by 20-25 min into the chase, preceding the initial appearance of 3H-apolipoproteins in the medium at 30-35 min of chase time. The secretion of VLDL 3H-phosphoglycerides was maximal much earlier, between 5 and 15 min into the chase, plateaued for 15 min, and then began again at 30 min, thereby displaying a distinctive biphasic pattern. In the presence of cycloheximide or puromycin, such that apopeptide synthesis was halted from the start of the chase, the secretion of VLDL 3H-glycerolipid was depressed after 30 min of chase, without having influenced the temporal pattern of the newly synthesized VLDL 3H-apolipoprotein and 3H-glycerolipid secretion. As compared to the cycloheximide-treated cells in which apolipoprotein B nascent chains were arrested intracellularly, the puromycin-treated cells secreted discharged apolipoprotein B nascent chains as VLDL constituents assembled with triacylglycerol. The differential kinetics of 3H-apolipoprotein, [3H]triacylglycerol, and 3H-phosphoglyceride secretion as VLDL and the timing of the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors on their secretion indicate that VLDL constituents are assembled sequentially in the intact liver cell. Some VLDL phosphoglyceride and the VLDL triacylglycerol are assembled with apolipoprotein early in the secretory pathway, forming a triacylglycerol-rich lipid-protein particle into which further phosphoglyceride is introduced just prior to its secretion as mature VLDL."

https://openalex.org/W1975033608,"Hepatic porphyrias are disorders of heme synthesis characterized by genetically determined lesions of one of the key enzymes of heme synthesis. In carriers of such lesions, several factors (drugs, environmental chemicals, or diet) precipitate acute and often fatal attacks of neurologic dysfunction, which are promptly relieved by intravenous infusion of heme. However, the mechanism of such heme-induced amelioration remains elusive. To probe this mechanism, the biochemical events triggered by acute hepatic heme deficiency were examined in an animal model of chemically induced porphyria. Acute hepatic heme depletion in porphyric rats was found to impair hepatic tryptophan pyrrolase activity which, in turn, elevated tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the brain. These alterations in porphyric rats were dramatically reversed by parenteral heme administration. These findings suggest that increased tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the nervous system may be responsible for the neurologic dysfunctions observed in humans with acute attacks of hepatic porphyria."

https://openalex.org/W1486503774,"Lingual lipase was highly purified from serous glands of rat tongue. Protein containing lipolytic activity was precipitated with 30-60% saturated ammonium sulfate from the 100,000 X g supernatant of a homogenate of the glands, resuspended in buffered solution, treated and precipitated with acetone at -20 degrees C, and redissolved in buffered solution at pH 5.4. This protein was further purified by hydrophobic chromatography on ethyl agarose; it was eluted with a micellar solution of sodium taurodeoxycholate, oleic acid, and monooleoylglycerol at pH 6.3. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed this fraction consisted of one major protein band, with Mr = 51,000, and several minor bands. A similar value for Mr of protein with lipolytic activity was obtained when acetone-precipitated protein was subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 indicating that 51,000 is the Mr of an active form of lingual lipase. Lingual lipase purified from rat tongue had a specific activity of 230 units/mg of protein (unit = micromoles of fatty acid formed/min at 37 degrees C). Purified lingual lipase hydrolyzed immediately long chain triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol and fatty acid in medium containing 17 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate and 3.3 mM CaCl2 at pH 5.4. It then hydrolyzed diacylglycerol, and later monoacylglycerol, but at rates 1:6 and 1:20, respectively, of that for triacylglycerol. The activity of lingual lipase in the presence of sodium taurodeoxycholate and CaCl2 was decreased only 33% when pH of the incubation medium was increased to 6.5. This indicates that lingual lipase, which is known to be active in stomach, could act in the small intestines."
https://openalex.org/W1498537456,"Abstract Interactions between Ca2+, exogenous calmodulin, and white skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase have been quantitatively studied by equilibrium gel filtrations and analyzed by means of the so-called linked functions theory (Weber, G. (1975) Adv. Protein Chem. 29, 1-83). Four moles of calmodulin, each saturated with at least 3 Ca2+ ions, bind to 1 mol of phosphorylase kinase with a Kdiss of 2.3 nM. The activation of the enzyme as a function of free [Ca2+] shows that the intrinsic Ca-binding properties of phosphorylase kinase do not change upon binding of exogenous calmodulin, and confirms that alpha beta gamma delta X Ca3 is the functional catalytic unit through which activation occurs. Direct binding studies reveal that the intrinsic Ca-binding properties of the enzyme remain the same in the presence of either 0.5 or 8 mM Mg2+, indicating that phosphorylase kinase is endowed with Ca-specific sites. Upon interaction with the enzyme, calmodulin acquires strong positive cooperativity in Ca2+-binding: whereas its first two stoichiometric Ca-binding constants are not significantly different from those of free calmodulin, the third Ca2+ ion binds with an affinity at least 10(5)-fold higher than the corresponding one in free calmodulin. Calmodulin liganded with 1 or 2 Ca2+ displays the same low affinity for the enzyme as calmodulin depleted of Ca2+ (approximate Kdiss = 10(-4)-10(-3) M). The alpha beta gamma delta X calmodulin X Ca3 complex is strengthened by a free energy coupling of -8 kcal/mol upon complexation. The quantitative analysis of our results predicts that in spite of this high free energy barrier the dissociation of the complex (i.e. the inactivation of phosphorylase kinase) occurs rapidly upon lowering free [Ca2+]."

https://openalex.org/W1480245711,"The reaction of oxygen with catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas arvilla ATCC 23974 in complex with catechol, 4-methylcatechol, and 4-fluorocatechol has been studied using single turnover stopped flow spectrophotometry. Two sequential enzyme intermediates have been resolved and their visible spectra characterized by computer-assisted methods. These intermediates are spectrally similar to those observed in a similar study with protocatechuate dioxygenase (Bull, C., Ballou, D. P., and Otsuka, S. J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12681-12686 (1981), although the first intermediate seen with the latter enzyme was not observed in this study. The rate of formation of intermediate I is oxygen-dependent and also accelerated by electron-donating substituents on the C-4 of the substrate. This is consistent with the proposed substrate reduction of dioxygen to form a hydroperoxide. Intermediate I is thus suggested to be a 6-hydroperoxycyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-one. The decay of intermediate I is also accelerated by electron donors and is consistent with the rearrangement of intermediate hydroperoxide via an acyl migration mechanism. It is inconsistent with mechanisms involving nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon. Intermediate II is proposed to be an enzyme-product complex based on the resemblance of its visible spectra to those of the benzoate complex of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and enzyme-product complexes of protocatechuate dioxygenase. Careful 18O2-labeling experiments have shown that no label is lost to the solvent, implying that no free hydroxide forms during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1488389508,"Abstract The interaction of sex steroid hormone receptors with the nuclear matrix (NM) of target and non-target tissue was investigated using a simple in vitro binding assay. Steroid receptors can recognize acceptor sites on the NM of target cells; androgen receptor binds with the highest apparent affinity to rat prostate NM; similarly estrogen receptor binds with the highest apparent affinity to uterine NM. Furthermore, the steroid receptor-NM interaction depends upon the hormonal status of the animal. The binding of androgen receptor to rat prostate NM was drastically reduced upon hormone withdrawal (castration) and fully recovered upon hormonal stimulation. When NM were prepared by an alternate method (DNase I digestion prior to high salt extraction) known to digest active chromatin, no preferential receptor binding to target tissue NM was observed. Although the NM fraction contains less than 1% of the total nuclear DNA, the matrix-associated DNA sequences seem to be, at least in part, responsible for specific receptor recognition. DNA extracted from the prostate NM was shown to be a potent competitor for androgen receptor binding as measured by DNA-cellulose competition experiments. Moreover, this DNA recognition also depends upon the hormonal status of the animal. These studies are consistent with the notion that hormonal manipulation induces changes in the NM-associated DNA sequences of steroid hormone target tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1530654169,"The catalytic properties of a 1440-fold purified preparation of lysosomal phospholipase A1 were examined. The preparation was at least 95% specific for the sn-1 position of neat phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The apparent specificity of the enzyme toward substrates was affected by three factors: the physical arrangement of molecules in the substrate aggregate, the charge on the lipid-water and the chemical structure of the substrate as it relates to the active site of the enzyme. Of various phospholipids tested in the absence of detergent PE was the preferred substrate, phosphatidylcholine (PC) was hydrolyzed at one-fifth the rate of PE, while phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were degraded very slowly. Triton WR1339 stimulated the hydrolysis of PC, PI, PS, and PG but inhibited the hydrolysis of PE, with PG the preferred substrate at a 6:1 Triton/phospholipid ratio. The preference for PC over PE in detergent mixtures was attributed to the active site fit of the chemical structures of the substrate molecules. The enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed neat PE containing palmitic and oleic acids at position 1. A negative surface charge was required for the hydrolysis of PC and PE. Ca2+ stimulated the hydrolysis of PI, PS, and PG but inhibited the hydrolysis of PE. The inhibition of PE hydrolysis by Ca2+ was the result of an alteration in the surface charge of the PE vesicle. Chromatography of phospholipase A1 on concanavalin A-Sepharose resulted in a loss of activity toward acidic phospholipids which could be restored with Ca2+. Plasmalogen PE was found to inhibit the hydrolysis of diacyl-PE at the level of interfacial binding but not by competition for the active site of the enzyme. These results suggest that the hexagonal structure of PE represents a preferred physical form for catalysis by phospholipase A1, while the bilayer form is less readily attacked. Dispersion of the substrate in the inert detergent enhanced the activity of those substrates normally forming bilayer structures. We demonstrate the importance of the quality of interface in regulating the activity of the enzyme."

G., and Lawler, D. M. (1974) Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 47B, 697-710). Blatta orientalis LSP was purified by sedimentation in preparative sucrose gradients followed by 2-hydroxypropylamino-cellulose anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration on a column of Bio-Gel A-1.5m. The amino acid composition of LSP includes 16.3 mol % tyrosine and 4.9 mol % phenylalanine, but virtually no cysteine and little methionine. The following physical properties were determined for LSP: R8 = 68.3 A, 8(20),w = 17.8, and V = 0.723. From these values an Mr = 507,900 was calculated. In electron micrographs, LSP appears as rectangular particles of 121 by 134 A. In disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, native LSP exhibits a single band, but in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, LSP is resolved into a doublet of closely spaced bands of Mr = 88,100 and 84,400 present in a ratio of 1.38:1. These data indicate that native B. orientalis LSP is a hexamer of subunits averaging approximately Mr = 86,000. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of Blattella germanica larval serum indicates that LSP in that species is a hexamer composed of a random assortment of two subunits of different charge in the ratio 1.25:1. The amino acid composition and physical properties of LSP suggest that LSP may be the hemimetabolous analogue of the tyrosine- and phenylalanine-rich storage proteins of holometabolous insects."

https://openalex.org/W1589949225,"The appearance of a functional thiol ester within murine pro-C4 (the intracellular precursor of C4) has been studied. This was assessed by testing the ability of pro-C4 molecules to undergo denaturation-dependent autolytic cleavage. In pulse-chase experiments, [35S]methionine-labeled pro-C4 does not autolyze until approximately 20 min after synthesis by peritoneal macrophages. When intact (not autolyzed) pro-C4 was examined by nonreducing gel electrophoresis, an increase in its apparent Mr was seen, with a time course similar to that for autolysis. Both the capacity to undergo autolytic cleavage and the Mr increase were inhibited by cell culture in the presence of the antibiotic tunicamycin or the threonine analog beta-hydroxynorvaline, both of which inhibit glycosylation. Upon isolation from tunicamycin- or hydroxynorvaline-treated cells, pro-C4 associates with other cell constituents, probably via disulfide bonds. This phenomenon is not seen with the mature (high Mr) form of pro-C4 in control cultures, and can be prevented if the cells are lysed in the presence of a sulfhydryl reagent such as iodoacetamide. These data suggest that the post-translational modification of pro-C4 includes the acquisition of a disulfide-stabilized conformation with a greater apparent Mr. This conformation, along with an intact thiol ester, is necessary for autolytic cleavage to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1709345302,"Substrates containing electron-withdrawing groups were reacted with protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and oxygen. Haloprotocatechuates (5-fluoro-, 5-chloro-, 5-bromo-, 2-chloro-, and 6-chloroprotocatechuates) are oxygenated by the enzyme at rates 28- to 3000-fold lower than that with the native substrate. These lower rates are due to both deactivation of substrate to O2 attack, and to the formation of abortive enzyme-substrate (ES) complexes. Such ES complexes with haloprotocatechuates are spectrally distinct from the normal ES complex. 6-Chloroprotocatechuate produces changes more like those due to protocatechuate. The abortive ES complexes, when rapidly mixed with oxygen, decay to free enzyme and product monophasically, and the dependence of the rates on O2 concentration shows that a rate-limiting step precedes reaction with O2. Thus these complexes are rather unreactive toward O2, and the rate-limiting step in oxygenation is their conversion to active complexes. In contrast, the reaction of O2 with the enzyme and 6-chloroprotocatechuate is biphasic, the first phase being dependent on O2 concentration (2 X 10(4) M-1 S-1) and the second not (7 S-1). The intermediate formed after the first phase strongly resembles the second intermediate seen in the reaction of enzyme with protocatechuate and O2 (Bull, C., Ballou, D. P., and Otsuka, S., (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12681-12686), implying that the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine slows the O2 addition step considerably while the conversion to the second intermediate is hardly affected. When the enzyme cycles through several turnovers with 6-chloroprotocatechuate, an enzyme species is formed that resembles the unreactive ES complexes seen with the other haloprotocatechuates, indicating that a small amount of the unreactive complex is in equilibrium with the reactive complex and that during successive turnovers the enzyme is slowly converted into the unreactive form. The formation of this form correlates with the observation that in assays the rate of product formation gradually decreases with time."

PTH stimulated Ca2+ uptake at 20 s of incubation from control values of 231 +/- 21 to 306 +/- 30 pmol/mg of protein, p less than 0.001. The stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by PTH was not reversed by incubation of the BBMV with the Ca2+ ionophore, despite the fact that Ca2+ uptake was several times greater than the expected uptake at equilibrium, indicating that most of the uptake represented Ca2+ binding to the BBMV. In BBMV from kidneys exposed to PTH, hypotonic lysis or increasing the osmolality of the solution external to the BBMV did not affect Ca2+ uptake. These data also indicated that the largest fraction of Ca2+ uptake in the presence of a chemical potential represented binding of Ca2+ to BBMV. Ca2+ binding was initially to the exterior of the BBMV, then translocated within the membrane and to the interior vesicular face as assessed by chelation of Ca2+ bound to the BBMV by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Incubation of BBMV from kidneys exposed to PTH with gentamicin, which competes with Ca2+ for anionic phospholipid-binding sites, reversed the stimulatory effects of PTH on Ca2+ uptake. Phosphorylation of BBMV and PTH treatment in vivo had similar effects on BBMV phospholipid composition increasing the levels of anionic phospholipids. Phosphorylation of the BBMV also produced gentamicin-inhibitable increases in membrane Ca2+ binding. Phosphorylation of BBMV from kidneys exposed to PTH was inhibited suggesting a higher state of phosphorylation in vivo. The data demonstrate that PTH administered in vivo stimulated Ca2+ binding in BBMV that was gentamicin inhibitable and associated with an increase in the membrane content of anionic phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1518268263,"The reduction of hemoglobins (Hb) M such as Hb M Iwate, Hb M Boston, Hb M Hyde Park, Hb M Saskatoon, and Hb M Milwaukee by the ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP reductase system was studied systematically under anaerobic conditions. The enzyme system could not reduce the abnormal chains in methemoglobin M with an alpha chain anomaly but effectively converted the methemoglobin M with a beta chain anomaly to the fully reduced form. During the reduction of the methemoglobin M with a beta chain anomaly, the spectra showed a shift of the initial isosbestic points, indicating the possible formation of intermediate hemoglobins in the partially reduced state. On the reduction mode of the methemoglobin M, however, it was classified into three types. 1) Only normal chains were reduced (Hb M Iwate and Hb M Boston). 2) Sequential reduction from normal to abnormal chains occurred (Hb M Milwaukee and Hb M Hyde Park). 3) Normal chains were preferentially reduced, but the reduction of abnormal chains also started at the same rate when the reduction of normal ones had proceeded halfway (Hb M Saskatoon). These differences are discussed in relation to the redox potential of each abnormal chain in methemoglobin M."
https://openalex.org/W1511781465,"The amphipathic flavoprotein NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase from steer liver was converted into the membrane-binding and soluble catalytic domains by controlled subtilisin proteolysis of vesicle-bound, externally oriented reductase. Amino acid analysis of the single nonpolar peptide which remained associated with the vesicles showed that it has a molecular weight of about 6400-6500 and that 65-66% of the amino acid residues are hydrophobic. Both the intact reductase and the nonpolar peptide were blocked to sequencing. Carboxypeptidase Y digestion of the holoenzyme and of a chymotryptically generated flavopeptide, which had lost membrane-binding capacity, released 1 residue of alanine and 2 residues of phenylalanine, indicating a common carboxyl terminus. Partial sequence analysis of the reductase placed the nonpolar peptide to the NH2-terminal side of the subtilisin-generated flavopeptide domain. Thus, the membrane-binding domain of cytochrome b5 reductase is localized at the NH2-terminus of the whole protein. The nonpolar peptide bound to vesicles contains a single fluorescent tryptophan with an emission maximum characteristic of a hydrophobic environment."
https://openalex.org/W1494689688,"The effect of pressure on the tertiary and quaternary structures of human oxy, carbonmonoxy, and deoxyhemoglobin was examined by high pressure NMR spectroscopy at 300 MHz. The increased pressure displaced the ring current-shifted gamma 1-methyl resonance of beta E11 valine for oxy- and carbonmonoxyhemoglobin to the upfield side, whereas that of the alpha subunit was insensitive to pressure. Such a preferential pressure-induced upfield shift for the beta E11 valine gamma 1-methyl signal was also encountered for the isolated carbonmonoxy beta chain. For deoxyhemoglobin, hyperfine shifted resonances of the heme peripheral proton groups and the proximal histidyl NH proton for the beta subunit were pressure-dependent, in contrast to the pressure-insensitive responses for these resonances of the alpha subunit. These results indicate the structural nonequivalence of the pressure-induced structural changes in the alpha and beta subunits of hemoglobin. The exchangeable proton resonances due to the intra- and intersubunit hydrogen bonds which have been used as the oxy and deoxy quaternary structural probes were not changed upon pressurization. From all of above results, it was concluded that pressure induces the tertiary structural change preferentially at the beta heme pocket of the ferrous hemoglobin derivatives with the quaternary structure retained."
https://openalex.org/W1652531433,"Abstract Solid state conformational analysis of N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-D-leucyl-L-phenylalanylethanolamide (t-Boc-D-Leu-L-Phe-EA), an N alpha-protected analogue of the COOH-terminal dipeptide of linear gramicidins, carried out by x-ray diffraction, has indicated that the molecules are characterized by an N-H...O = C intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded chain reversal of the beta-turn II' type. One of the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit shows an additional intramolecular hydrogen bond of the O-H...O = C type, linking the hydroxyl function of the COOH-terminal ethanolamide moiety to the carbonyl oxygen of the urethane N-protecting group. This is the first experimental evidence for a beta-turn conformation fused with the oxy analogue of an alpha-turn. The results of an investigation in a solvent of low polarity (deuteriochloroform), using infrared absorption and 1' nuclear magnetic resonance, strongly support the view that an intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded beta-turn conformation is the most populated conformation of t-Boc-D-Leu-L-Phe-EA molecules at high dilution. In the self-association process, taking place at high concentration, the urethane and peptide NH groups are involved as hydrogen-bonding donors."
