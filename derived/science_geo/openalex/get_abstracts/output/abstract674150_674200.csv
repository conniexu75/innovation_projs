https://openalex.org/W3163785571,"Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4–28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7–13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic. Estimates of the levels of neutralizing antibodies necessary for protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19 are a fraction of the mean level in convalescent serum and will be useful in guiding vaccine rollouts."

https://openalex.org/W3161556485,"Insulators play a critical role in spatiotemporal gene regulation in animals. The evolutionarily conserved CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is required for insulator function in mammals, but not all of its binding sites act as insulators. Here we explore the sequence requirements of CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation using a sensitive insulator reporter in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that insulation potency depends on the number of CTCF-binding sites in tandem. Furthermore, CTCF-mediated insulation is dependent on upstream flanking sequences at its binding sites. CTCF-binding sites at topologically associating domain boundaries are more likely to function as insulators than those outside topologically associating domain boundaries, independently of binding strength. We demonstrate that insulators form local chromatin domain boundaries and weaken enhancer-promoter contacts. Taken together, our results provide genetic, molecular and structural evidence connecting chromatin topology to the action of insulators in the mammalian genome."

Developing an at-scale workflow for mtDNA variant analyses, we show correlations between nuclear and mitochondrial genomic structures within subpopulations of Great Britain and establish a UK Biobank reference atlas of mtDNA–phenotype associations. A total of 260 mtDNA–phenotype associations were new (P < 1 × 10−5), including rs2853822/m.8655 C>T (MT-ATP6) with type 2 diabetes, rs878966690/m.13117 A>G (MT-ND5) with multiple sclerosis, 6 mtDNA associations with adult height, 24 mtDNA associations with 2 liver biomarkers and 16 mtDNA associations with parameters of renal function. Rare-variant gene-based tests implicated complex I genes modulating mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Seven traits had both rare and common mtDNA associations, where rare variants tended to have larger effects than common variants. Our work illustrates the value of studying mtDNA variants in common complex diseases and lays foundations for future large-scale mtDNA association studies."

Electrophysiological and single-cell sequencing experiments have revealed a remarkable degree of heterogeneity of these neurons. However, the exact molecular basis and functional consequences of this heterogeneity have not yet been addressed. Here, we have developed new mouse models in which intersectional Cre/Dre-dependent recombination allowed for successful labeling, translational profiling and functional characterization of distinct POMC neurons expressing the leptin receptor (Lepr) and glucagon like peptide 1 receptor (Glp1r). Our experiments reveal that POMCLepr+ and POMCGlp1r+ neurons represent largely nonoverlapping subpopulations with distinct basic electrophysiological properties. They exhibit a specific anatomical distribution within the arcuate nucleus and differentially express receptors for energy-state communicating hormones and neurotransmitters. Finally, we identify a differential ability of these subpopulations to suppress feeding. Collectively, we reveal a notably distinct functional microarchitecture of critical metabolism-regulatory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3163590632,"Background During the Covid-19 pandemic, the negative effects of wearing a mouth-nose cover (MNC) on interpersonal functioning have been discussed in public media but empirical studies on how wearing MNCs affect social judgements are sparse. In the present study, we investigated the effects of MNCs on trustworthiness appraisals, the influence of changes due to MNCs in evaluating joy, and the relationship between a social-cognitive appraisal bias and a participant’s characteristics. Methods All participants ( N = 165) judged the intensity of happiness and trustworthiness in calm facial stimuli presented with and without a surgical mask covering part of the face. We analysed the relationship of changes in judgements evoked by MNCs to participants’ evaluations of MNCs as protective tools and explored their associations with the burden experienced by wearing MNCs, compliance to behaviour recommendations, their risk associated with the pandemic, and their levels of psychological distress. Results Overall, calm facial stimuli covered with MNCs were evaluated as less trustworthy and, to an even stronger extent, less happy than uncovered facial stimuli. However, participants varied in whether they showed a negative or positive evaluation of faces with MNCs; the negative bias was stronger in those participants who attributed lower protective potential to MNCs, experienced a higher burden while wearing MNCs, wore MNCs less often, and experienced a higher level of psychological distress. Conclusions A negative bias in trustworthiness appraisals of faces with a positive emotional expression covered by MNCs is linked to a participant’s evaluation of MNCs as inefficient and burdening and their experience of high psychological distress."

https://openalex.org/W3161430981,"Background Novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that has caused a global pandemic. As of July 2020, there were 8,475 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, and a total of 52 cases and 1 death were reported in Debre Berhan where this study was conducted. Under these conditions, we sought to assess what undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University knew about COVID-19 and how it shaped their attitudes and practices regarding this disease. Objective The aim of the current study was to assess undergraduate student knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 in Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 18–24, 2020 among undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was employed with a total sample size of 634. Proportional allocation of samples was used to the randomly selected colleges, and a systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit the students. The data were checked for completeness, coded, entered into Epi-Data VS 3.1, and then exported into STATA™ Version 14 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors. Factors were selected with the entry method. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the associations between variables and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP). Results From a total of 546 included participants, more than half of them, 307 (57%) were males. Seventy-three percent of them heard about novel coronavirus from social media. In this study, 73.8% of the participants were knowledgeable, and their overall attitude was favorable. Approximately 71.4% correctly responded that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Nearly half, 229 (42%) of the students approved that they had no concern of being infected with COVID-19. Moreover, most participants showed poor practices; more than half of the study subjects were not maintaining a physical distance. In multivariable analyses, people older than 25 years (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI; 1.2, 4.6) and those who lived in urban areas (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI; 2.6, 15.8) were significantly more knowledgeable about COVID-19. Furthermore, those students that have information about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI; 1.6, 8.7) was significantly associated with the attitude undergraduate students had about COVID-19 as compared with its counterpart. Conclusion The undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University were moderately knowledgeable about COVID-19 and had an optimistic attitude towards its resolution. However, this optimism may lead to poor public health practices within this community. Therefore, greater efforts need to be made through more comprehensive and directed actions and awareness campaigns to increase the knowledge, attitude and practice of the students."

Here we investigate the role of Rora across CD4+ T cells in general, but with an emphasis on Th2 cells, both in vitro as well as in the context of several in vivo type 2 infection models. We dissect the function of Rora using overexpression and a CD4-conditional Rora-knockout mouse, as well as a RORA-reporter mouse. We establish the importance of Rora in CD4+ T cells for controlling lung inflammation induced by Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection, and have measured the effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using a systematic stimulation screen of CD4+ T cells, coupled with RNA-seq, we identify upstream regulators of Rora, most importantly IL-33 and CCL7. Our data suggest that Rora is a negative regulator of the immune system, possibly through several downstream pathways, and is under control of the local microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3163311903,"Introduction: SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic causes serious emotional consequences. It has occurred widespread medical courses suspension, and graduations were anticipated. Field hospitals, set up to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, were the main workplaces of newly graduated doctors. Objective: To assess the impact of SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of medical interns and newly graduated doctors. Method: This is a cross-sectional study performed using a digital platform. Links to forms were sent in two moments: moment 1 (M1), at the beginning of the pandemic, in the first half of April/2020 and moment 2 (M2), after six months of pandemic, in the second half of September/2020. All students from the medical internship and all doctors graduated since 2018 from the three medical schools in Sergipe-NE-Brazil were invited. Results: 335 forms were answered in April and 148 in September. In M1 88.9% considered themselves exposed to excess of information about COVID-19, which was associated with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.04). Long family physical distance was also associated with these symptoms, as increased appetite (p = 0.01), feeling shortness of breath (p = 0.003) and sweating (p = 0.007). Fear of acquire COVID-19 was reported as intense by almost half of participants, and of transmitting by 85.7% in M1. In M2 41.2% reported the death of friends or relatives. Psychiatric illness was described by 38.5% and psychotropic drugs use by 30.1% in M1, especially those who lived alone (p = 0.03) and the single ones (p = 0.01). Alcohol intake was reported by 54.3%, and among doctors graduated in 2020 it increased from 50% in M1 to 85% in M2 (p = 0.04). Conclusion: The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of medical students and newly graduated doctors. Exposure to excessive COVID-19 information and family physical distance were associated to anxiety symptoms. Among doctors graduated in 2020, alcohol intake increased during pandemic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3161691797,"Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential mineral of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal biochemistry because of the Ca2+ dependence of ER-resident chaperones charged with folding de novo proteins that transit this cellular compartment. ER Ca2+ depletion reduces the ability of chaperones to properly fold the proteins entering the ER, thus leading to an accumulation of misfolded proteins and the onset of a state known as ER stress. However, not all conditions that cause ER stress do so in a manner dependent on ER Ca2+ depletion. Agents such as tunicamycin inhibit the glycosylation of de novo polypeptides, a key step in the maturation process of newly synthesized proteins. Despite this established effect of tunicamycin, our understanding of how such conditions modulate ER Ca2+ levels is still limited. In the present study, we report that a variety of ER stress–inducing agents that have not been known to directly alter ER Ca2+ homeostasis can also cause a marked reduction in ER Ca2+ levels. Consistent with these observations, protecting against ER stress using small chemical chaperones, such as 4-phenylbutyrate and tauroursodeoxycholic acid, also attenuated ER Ca2+ depletion caused by these agents. We also describe a novel high-throughput and low-cost assay for the rapid quantification of ER stress using ER Ca2+ levels as a surrogate marker.

This report builds on our understanding of ER Ca2+ levels in the context of ER stress and also provides the scientific community with a new, reliable tool to study this important cellular process in vitro. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a crucial organelle in the majority of cell types, known to play a key role in calcium (Ca2+) storage, lipid synthesis, detoxification of chemicals, and de novo peptide synthesis and maturation (1Hetz C. The unfolded protein response: Controlling cell fate decisions under ER stress and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Charged with such diverse tasks are a vast array of ER-luminal molecular chaperones, which rely on the highly specialized and regulated environment provided to them by the ER. Disturbances in this environment reduce chaperone activity, and thus, misfolded de novo polypeptides, lipids, and/or other toxins begin to accumulate in the ER lumen. This imbalance is known as ER stress and is an established driver of a variety of human diseases including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, and several metabolic diseases (2Austin R.C. The unfolded protein response in health and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Al-Hashimi A. Crane E. Austin R. Oxidative stress and the endoplasmic reticulum.in: Pantopoulos K. Schipper H.M. Principles of Free Radical Biomedicine. Nova Science Publishers, New York, NY2011: 1-20Google Scholar). Initiation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) resolves ER stress by inducing chaperone expression, thereby increasing the protein folding capacity of the ER (4Gardner B.M. Pincus D. Gotthardt K. Gallagher C.M. Walter P. Endoplasmic reticulum stress sensing in the unfolded protein response.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a013169Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The UPR consists of a highly conserved signaling cascade orchestrated by three interrelated components: (a) the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α, (b) the activating transcription factor 6, and (c) the protein kinase R-like ER kinase. If the UPR fails to overcome this form of cellular stress, a proapoptotic program is initiated to remove the damaged cells from otherwise healthy tissue (5Sano R. Reed J.C. ER stress-induced cell death mechanisms.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833: 3460-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Ca2+ homeostasis is of critical importance for cells because of its role in regulating a variety of cellular processes including metabolism, phosphorylation, cell proliferation, division and differentiation, gene transcription, cell motility, muscle excitation-contraction, programmed cell death, and neurotransmission (6Krebs J. Agellon L.B. Michalak M. Ca(2+) homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress: An integrated view of calcium signaling.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 460: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). ER luminal Ca2+ represents a fundamental component of the environment on which the majority of ER-resident chaperones depend (7Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. Francois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J.

Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To maintain elevated Ca2+ levels relative to the cytosol, three different classes of proteins must be expressed in the ER. These include (a) ER-resident Ca2+-binding proteins that increase the Ca2+-retaining ability of the ER, (b) ATP-dependent pumps, such as the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) for pumping Ca2+ into the ER lumen against the electrochemical gradient, and (c) Ca2+ channels, such as the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and inositol-trisphosphate receptor, which slowly release Ca2+ back into the cytosol for signaling purposes (9Michalak M. Robert Parker J.M. Opas M. Ca2+ signaling and calcium binding chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It is well established that ER Ca2+ depletion caused by SERCA pump inhibitors, such as thapsigargin (TG), induces a robust UPR activation (10Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Hou Y.F. Melan M.A. Chen X.

Chem. 2017; 292: 1510-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a reciprocal manner, recent evidence also demonstrates that inhibition of channels or promoting SERCA pump activation can also protect against ER stress (12Ruiz A. Matute C. Alberdi E. Intracellular Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptors contributes to AMPA receptor-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress in oligodendrocytes.Cell Death Dis. 2010; 1: e54Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Kang S. Dahl R. Hsieh W. Shin A. Zsebo K.M. Buettner C. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D.

Chem. 2016; 291: 5185-5198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Not all conditions leading to ER stress, however, function directly through Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. Agents such as tunicamycin (TM) are known to inhibit N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER, a key step in the maturation of most secretory and cell-surface proteins, thus leading to their accumulation in this compartment (14Merlie J.P. Sebbane R. Tzartos S. Lindstrom J. Inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin blocks assembly of newly synthesized acetylcholine receptor subunits in muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2694-2701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, heritable loss-of-function protein mutants that transit the ER, such as vasopressin (VP) and α1-antitrypsin, fail to pass ER quality control and accumulate in the ER leading to ER stress and disease (15Lin L. Schmidt B. Teckman J. Perlmutter D.H. A naturally occurring nonpolymerogenic mutant of alpha 1-antitrypsin characterized by prolonged retention in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33893-33898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Yan Z. Hoffmann A. Kaiser E.K. Grunwald Jr., W.C. Cool D.R. Misfolding of mutated vasopressin causes ER-retention and activation of ER-stress markers in neuro-2a cells.Open Neuroendocrinol J. 2011; 4: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The effect of such conditions on ER Ca2+ levels, the fundamental regulator of ER chaperone function, is often overlooked and underappreciated. In this report, we provide novel evidence that ER Ca2+ depletion not only promotes ER stress but can also occur as a result of ER stress. Although it is well established that agents such as TG significantly reduce ER Ca2+ levels, to our surprise, we also observed a significant reduction of ER Ca2+ upon treatment with ER stress–inducing agents that are not known to impact ER Ca2+ levels directly. Further confirmation and characterization of this unexpected occurrence also demonstrated that small chemical chaperones such as 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) attenuated ER Ca2+ loss resulting from TG- and TM-induced ER stress. Based on the reliability of ER Ca2+ levels to reflect the state of ER stress, we also describe a cost- and time-effective assay that takes advantage of the high-throughput and sensitive nature of fluorescent probes to use ER Ca2+ as a surrogate marker for the accurate quantitative assessment of ER stress in live cells. In contrast to high-affinity indicators used to measure Ca2+ concentration in conditions of low abundance, such as the cytosol, low-affinity dyes can be used for the assessment of Ca2+ in cellular compartments with elevated Ca2+ levels, including the ER (17Paredes R.M. Etzler J.C. Watts L.T. Zheng W. Lechleiter J.D. Chemical calcium indicators.Methods. 2008; 46: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Our need to understand and quantify the effect of ER stress on ER Ca2+ levels in a reliable and high-throughput manner led us to develop a low-cost microtiter plate assay using the Ca2+ dye, Mag-Fluo-4 AM. To validate the performance of the assay, a number of experiments were first carried out with established modulators of ER Ca2+. Consistent with previous studies (11Lebeau P. Al-Hashimi A. Sood S. Lhotak S. Yu P. Gyulay G. Pare G. Chen S.R. Trigatti B. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Austin R.C. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and Ca2+ depletion differentially modulate the sterol regulatory protein PCSK9 to control lipid metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 1510-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we observed that TG caused a marked reduction in ER Ca2+ levels, as indicated by a reduction in fluorescence intensity in HuH7 immortalized hepatocytes loaded with Mag-Fluo-4 AM (Fig. 1A). In contrast to these results, we observed that an agent known to increase SERCA pump activity, CDN 1163 (CDN) (13Kang S. Dahl R. Hsieh W. Shin A. Zsebo K.M. Buettner C. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. Small molecular allosteric activator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) attenuates diabetes and metabolic disorders.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 5185-5198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), increased fluorescence intensity in Mag-Fluo-4–loaded cells (Fig. 1B), indicative of an increase in ER Ca2+. Changes in fluorescence intensity of the ER using Mag-Fluo-4 AM were also visualized using a fluorescent microscope and were consistent with values obtained from the quantitative assay (Fig. 1, C and D). TG-induced ER stress was confirmed via immunoblot and real-time quantitative PCR analysis of ER stress markers including the glucose-regulated proteins of 78 kDa and 94 kDa (GRP78 and GRP94, respectively) and spliced X-box–binding protein. Genetically induced changes in ER Ca2+ levels were also assessed in HuH7 cells transfected with RyR2 variants, E4872A and Q4201R. Consistent with previous reports (18Priori S.G. Chen S.R. Inherited dysfunction of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling and arrhythmogenesis.Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19Chen W. Wang R. Chen B. Zhong X. Kong H. Bai Y. Zhou Q. Xie C. Zhang J. Guo A. Tian X. Jones P.P. O'Mara M.L. Liu Y. Mi T. et al.The ryanodine receptor store-sensing gate controls Ca2+ waves and Ca2+-triggered arrhythmias.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), data generated using Mag-Fluo-4 AM suggest that the loss-of-function variant E4872A-RyR2 prevents ER Ca2+ leakage, whereas the gain-of-function Q4201R increases ER Ca2+ leakage (Fig. 1G). The ability of agents that affect SERCA pump activity to cause changes in ER Ca2+ levels is well established (20Cheng T.C. Benton H.P. The intracellular Ca(2+)-pump inhibitors thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid induce stress proteins in mammalian chondrocytes.Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is also widely accepted that these agents affect the UPR in a manner dependent on such changes. Having optimized the sensitivity of the Mag-Fluo-4–based assay using established ER Ca2+-modulating agents, our next aim was to assess changes in ER Ca2+ levels in response to other well-established ER stress–inducing agents that are not known to cause ER stress in a manner dependent on changes in ER Ca2+ levels. Strikingly, similar to TG treatment, a dose-dependent reduction of ER Ca2+ was also observed in HuH7 cells treated with TM 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2A). TM-induced changes in fluorescence intensity were also visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 2B). UPR activation in response to TM was confirmed via assessment of GRP78 and GRP94 using immunoblots and real-time PCR (Fig. 2, C and D). The effect of TG and TM on ER Ca2+ levels was also examined in HK2 and HEK293 immortalized kidney cell lines as well as HepG2 human hepatocytes subjected to the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2E). Although TG and TM are among the most commonly used agents to study the impact of ER stress in laboratory models, a variety of chemicals are known to negatively impact the ER environment and cause ER stress. Homocysteine has been shown to contribute to dyslipidemia via pathological activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, thus contributing to cardiovascular disease (21Werstuck G.H. Lentz S.R. Dayal S. Hossain G.S. Sood S.K. Shi Y.Y. Zhou J. Maeda N. Krisans S.K. Malinow M.R. Austin R.C. Homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress causes dysregulation of the cholesterol and triglyceride biosynthetic pathways.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); DTT is a reducing agent capable of preventing disulfide bond formation of nascent proteins in the ER by chaperones such as protein disulfide isomerase and ERp72 (22Maity S. Rajkumar A. Matai L. Bhat A. Ghosh A. Agam G. Kaur S. Bhatt N.R. Mukhopadhyay A. Sengupta S. Chakraborty K. Oxidative homeostasis regulates the response to reductive endoplasmic reticulum stress through translation control.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 851-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and bisphenol-A is an estrogen mimetic commonly found in plastics, capable of antagonizing the SERCA pump in a manner similar to TG (23Asahi J. Kamo H. Baba R. Doi Y. Yamashita A. Murakami D. Hanada A. Hirano T. Bisphenol A induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis in mouse non-parenchymal hepatocytes.Life Sci. 2010; 87: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, the accumulation of misfolded protein variants that fail to pass ER quality controls is also a known driver of ER storage diseases (24Callea F. Brisigotti M. Fabbretti G. Bonino F. Desmet V.J. Hepatic endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases.Liver. 1992; 12: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VP variants, for instance, contribute to a form of autosomal dominant diabetes insipidus in a manner dependent on ER stress (16Yan Z. Hoffmann A. Kaiser E.K. Grunwald Jr., W.C. Cool D.R. Misfolding of mutated vasopressin causes ER-retention and activation of ER-stress markers in neuro-2a cells.Open Neuroendocrinol J. 2011; 4: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similarly, changes in the expression or activity of ER-resident Ca2+-binding proteins can affect their ability to bind and maintain elevated ER Ca2+ levels relative to the cytosol (6Krebs J. Agellon L.B. Michalak M. Ca(2+) homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress: An integrated view of calcium signaling.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Interestingly, we observed that all of the aforementioned agents and conditions caused the depletion of ER Ca2+ 24 h after treatment in HuH7 cells (Fig. 2F). We also demonstrate that culturing cells in a Ca2+-deprived medium resulted in ER Ca2+ depletion and ER stress, as demonstrated by ER Ca2+ quantification and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, respectively (Fig. S1, A and B). In line with previous findings (25Prins D. Michalak M. Organellar calcium buffers.Cold Spring Harb Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Dai F. Lee H. Zhang Y. Zhuang L. Yao H. Xi Y. Xiao Z.D. You M.J. Li W. Su X. Gan B. BAP1 inhibits the ER stress gene regulatory network and modulates metabolic stress response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, cell viability after the treatment with known cytotoxic agents, such as DTT and bisphenol-A, was also verified (Fig. S2, A and B). To support our hypothesis that TM causes ER Ca2+ depletion as a secondary byproduct of ER stress, additional assays were carried out using a high-affinity cytosolic Ca2+ dye to assess its ability to spontaneously affect ER Ca2+ release. Consistent with previous reports (11Lebeau P. Al-Hashimi A. Sood S. Lhotak S. Yu P. Gyulay G. Pare G. Chen S.R. Trigatti B. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Austin R.C. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and Ca2+ depletion differentially modulate the sterol regulatory protein PCSK9 to control lipid metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 1510-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), TG caused a spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the ER (Fig. 3A). In contrast, TM did not significantly impact the release of Ca2+ from the ER into the cytosol (Fig. 3B). A direct comparison of ER Ca2+ was then carried out in HuH7 cells treated with doses of TG and TM that caused a similar level of UPR activation 10 h after treatment, as indicated by GRP78 and GRP94 immunoblots (Fig. 3C). Consistent with previous experiments, TG and TM induced a reduction of ER Ca2+ levels compared with vehicle-treated cells. Importantly, however, TG reduced ER Ca2+ levels to a greater extent than TM at all time points examined (Fig. 3D). Given that TM does not cause a spontaneous release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and fails to cause ER Ca2+ depletion to the same extent as TG, these data suggest that TM-induced changes in ER Ca2+ occur as a downstream result of ER stress. To further assess the role of ER stress as an upstream effector of ER Ca2+ levels, our next aim was to examine whether small chemical chaperones and other agents known to protect against ER stress (29Basseri S. Lhotak S. Sharma A.M. Austin R.C. The chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate inhibits adipogenesis by modulating the unfolded protein response.J.

Rep. 2017; 7: 3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) can also restore ER Ca2+ levels. Accordingly, HuH7 cells were pretreated with 4-PBA, TUDCA, metformin, or CDN for 24 h and then exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle, TG, or TM for an additional 24 h before the Mag-Fluo-4 assay (Fig. 4A). Results from these experiments demonstrate that (a) 4-PBA, TUDCA, and metformin treatment alone does not affect ER Ca2+ but that (b) these agents prevent ER Ca2+ loss during conditions of TG- and TM-induced ER stress. The SERCA pump activator, CDN (13Kang S. Dahl R. Hsieh W. Shin A. Zsebo K.M. Buettner C. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. Small molecular allosteric activator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) attenuates diabetes and metabolic disorders.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 5185-5198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), increased ER Ca2+ levels in the absence and in the presence of TG or TM. Interestingly, we also observed that 4-PBA did not attenuate the ability of TG to cause an influx of Ca2+ from the ER into the cytosol (Fig. 4B). Given that 4-PBA protects against ER stress (Fig. 4C) but does not directly affect ER Ca2+ transients, these data also support the notion that ER Ca2+ can be altered as a result of ER stress. ER stress is a well-studied cellular stress pathway that can contribute to a number of disease states (2Austin R.C. The unfolded protein response in health and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, there remains much to be uncovered about the intricacies of the UPR as well as the secondary messengers that modulate its signaling cascades. In this report, we demonstrate that ER stress–inducing agents such as TM fail to promote immediate changes in ER Ca2+ release but that prolonged 24-h exposure of TM can reduce ER Ca2+ levels to a similar extent as established Ca2+-modulating agents such as TG. The homeostasis of ER Ca2+ is maintained by an elaborate system of ER-resident Ca2+ transporters, Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+-binding/buffering proteins. Any changes in expression or activity of these components can impact ER Ca2+ levels (6Krebs J. Agellon L.B. Michalak M.

Commun. 2015; 460: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 9Michalak M. Robert Parker J.M. Opas M. Ca2+ signaling and calcium binding chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Given the number of variables that play a role in this equilibrium, the exact mechanisms by which the inhibition of N-glycosylation by TM, or other conditions that cause of ER stress, affect ER Ca2+ levels are likely numerous. For instance, SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake was increased in conditions of ER stress induced by ER Ca2+ depletion as well as TM (32Hojmann Larsen A. Frandsen A. Treiman M. Upregulation of the SERCA-type Ca2+ pump activity in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress in PC12 cells.BMC Biochem. 2001; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In another example, TM treatment induced the production of oxidative species in smooth muscle cells (33Santos C.X. Tanaka L.Y. Wosniak J. Laurindo F.R. Mechanisms and implications of reactive oxygen species generation during the unfolded protein response: Roles of endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductases, mitochondrial electron transport, and NADPH oxidase.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2409-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while oxidation of RyR in the skeletal muscle was associated with persistent activation of RyR channels, which was accompanied by an increase in Ca2+ efflux from the ER (34Waning D.L. Mohammad K.S. Reiken S. Xie W. Andersson D.C. John S. Chiechi A. Wright L.E. Umanskaya A. Niewolna M. Trivedi T. Charkhzarrin S. Khatiwada P. Wronska A. Haynes A. et al.Excess TGF-β mediates muscle weakness associated with bone metastases in mice.Nat. Med. 2015; 11: 1262-1271Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similar to our findings, Yamamoto et al. (35Yamamoto W.R. Bone R.N. Sohn P. Syed F. Reissaus C.A. Mosley A.L. Wijeratne A.B. True J.D. Tong X. Kono T. Evans-Molina C. Endoplasmic reticulum stress alters ryanodine receptor function in the murine pancreatic β cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 1: 168-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TM treatment induced ER Ca2+ release in β-pancreatic cells. Furthermore, TM directly induced activation of the RyR, whereas no change in RyR expression or inositol-trisphosphate receptor function was observed (35Yamamoto W.R. Bone R.N. Sohn P. Syed F. Reissaus C.A. Mosley A.L. Wijeratne A.B. True J.D. Tong X. Kono T. Evans-Molina C. Endoplasmic reticulum stress alters ryanodine receptor function in the murine pancreatic β cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 1: 168-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because of the protein-centric nature of ER-resident Ca2+ modulators, it is also possible that TM-mediated ER stress reduces the ability of the ER to produce or replace old/damaged pumps and/or channels at the ER membrane. In line with this notion, studies demonstrate that TM can induce protein misfolding within the ER (36Mimnaugh E.G. Xu W. Vos M. Yuan X. Neckers L.

Currently, a multitude of perfusion solutions exist for renal NMP. This study aimed to evaluate four different perfusion solutions side-by-side and determine the influence of different perfusate compositions on measured renal perfusion parameters. Porcine kidneys and blood were obtained from a slaughterhouse. Kidneys underwent NMP at 37°C for 7 hours, with 4 different perfusion solutions (n = 5 per group). Group 1 consisted of red blood cells (RBCs) and a perfusion solution based on Williams’ Medium E. Group 2 consisted of RBCs, albumin and a balanced electrolyte composition. Group 3 contained RBCs and a medium based on a British clinical NMP solution. Group 4 contained RBCs and a medium used in 24-hour perfusion experiments. NMP flow patterns for solutions 1 and 2 were similar, solutions 3 and 4 showed lower but more stable flow rates. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were significantly higher in solution 1 and 4 compared to the other groups. Levels of injury marker N-acetyl-β-D glucosaminidase were significantly lower in solution 2 in comparison with solution 3 and 4. This study illustrates that the perfusate composition during NMP significantly impacts the measured perfusion and injury parameters and thus affects the interpretation of potential viability markers. Further research is required to investigate the individual influences of principal perfusate components to determine the most optimal conditions during NMP and eventually develop universal organ assessment criteria."
https://openalex.org/W3160088627,"Purpose The long-term survival of uveal melanoma patients in the US is not known. We compared long-term survival estimates using relative survival, excess absolute risk (EAR), Kaplan-Meier (KM), and competing risk analyses. Setting Population based cohort study. Study population Pooled databases from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data (SEER, SEER-9+SEER-13+SEER-18). Main outcome measure Overall Survival (OS), Metastasis Free Survival (MFS) and relative survival, computed directly or estimated via a model fitted to excess mortality. Results There were 10678 cases of uveal melanoma spanning a period of 42 years (1975–2016). The median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range 3–99). Over half the patients were still alive at the end of 2016 (53%, 5625). The KM estimates of MFS were 0.729 (0.719, 0.74), 0.648 (0.633, 0.663), and 0.616 (0.596, 0.636) at 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of melanoma metastatic death at 10, 20 and 30 years were 0.241 (0.236, 0.245), 0.289 (0.283, 0.294), and 0.301 (0.295, 0.307). In the first 5 years since diagnosis of uveal melanoma, the proportion of deaths attributable to uveal melanoma were 1.3 with rapid fall after 10 years. Death due to melanoma were rare beyond 20 years. Relative survival (RS) plateaued to ~60% across 20 to 30 years. EAR parametric modeling yielded a survival probability of 57%. Conclusions Relative survival methods can be used to estimate long term survival of uveal melanoma patients without knowing the exact cause of death. RS and EAR provide more realistic estimates as they compare the survival to that of a normal matched population. Death due to melanoma were rare beyond 20 years with normal life expectancy reached at 25 years after primary therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3160302520,"Objective Teriflunomide is a once-daily, oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied clinical outcomes in a real-world setting involving a population-based large cohort of unselected patients enrolled in The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry (DMSR) who started teriflunomide treatment between 2013–2019. Methods This was a complete nationwide population-based cohort study with prospectively enrolled unselected cases. Demographic and disease-specific patient parameters related to treatment history, efficacy outcomes, and discontinuation and switching rates among other clinical variables were assessed at baseline and during follow-up visits. Results A total of 3239 patients (65.4% female) started treatment with teriflunomide during the study period, 56% of whom were treatment-naïve. Compared to previously treated patients, treatment-naïve patients were older on average at disease onset, had a shorter disease duration, a lower Expanded Disability Status Scale score at teriflunomide treatment start and more frequently experienced a relapse in the 12 months prior to teriflunomide initiation. In the 3001 patients initiating teriflunomide treatment at least 12 months before the cut-off date, 72.7% were still on treatment one year after treatment start. Discontinuations in the first year were due mainly to adverse events (15.6%). Over the full follow-up period, 47.5% of patients discontinued teriflunomide treatment. Sixty-three percent of the patients treated with teriflunomide for 5 years were relapse-free, while significantly more treatment-naïve versus previously treated patients experienced a relapse during the follow-up (p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, 85% of the patients with available data were free of disability worsening at the end of follow-up. Conclusions Solid efficacy and treatment persistence data consistent with other real-world studies were obtained over the treatment period. Treatment outcomes in this real-world scenario of the population-based cohort support previous findings that teriflunomide is an effective and generally well-tolerated DMT for relapsing MS patients with mild to moderate disease activity."

Africa remains the region with the greatest burden of the disease. Cameroon is among the countries with a very high burden of malaria, with the coastal and forest regions carrying the highest burden of the disease. Nkongho-mbeng is a typical rural setting in the equatorial rain forest region of Cameroon, with no existing knowledge of the epidemiology of malaria in this locality. This study aimed at determining the current status of malaria epidemiology in Nkongho-mbeng. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, during which blood samples were collected from 500 participants and examined by microscopy. Risk factors such as, age, sex, duration of stay in the locality, housing type, environmental sanitation and intervention strategies including use of, LLINs and drugs were investigated. Trends in malaria morbidity were also determined. Of the 500 samples studied, 60 were positive, giving an overall prevalence of 12.0% with the prevalence of asymptomatic infection (10.8%), more than quadruple the prevalence of symptomatic infections (1.2%) and, fever burden not due to malaria was 1.4%. The GMPD was 6,869.17 parasites/μL of blood (95% C.I: 4,977.26/μL– 9,480.19/μL). A LLINs coverage of 84.4% and 77.88% usage was observed. Unexpectedly, the prevalence of malaria was higher among those sleeping under LLINs (12.56%) than those not sleeping under LLINs (8.97%), though the difference was not significant (p = 0.371). Being a male (p = 0.044), being unemployed (p = 0.025) and, living in Mbetta (p = 0.013) or Lekwe (p = 0.022) and the presence bushes around homes (p = 0.002) were significant risk factors associated with malaria infection. Trends in proportion demonstrated that, the prevalence of malaria amongst patients receiving treatment in the health center from 2015 to 2019 decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) and linearly from 9.74% to 3.08% respectively. Data generated from this study can be exploited for development of a more effective control measures to curb the spread of malaria within Nkongho-mbeng."
https://openalex.org/W3162182829,"This study aimed to elucidate the effects of selenium-loaded chitosan nanoparticles used as a dietary supplement on Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) antioxidant and growth responses. First, chitosan-based nanoparticles containing selenium (Se) were synthesized using the ionotropic gelation method and their physicochemical characteristics, controlled release profile, and antioxidant activity properties were investigated. Thereafter, the effects on glutathione peroxidase and antioxidant activities (by radical scavenging activity), growth, and whole-body composition of Nile tilapia were evaluated when they were fed with Se-loaded chitosan nanoparticles and compared with other selenium dietary supplements. Se-loaded chitosan nanoparticles showed high entrapment efficiency (87%), spherical shape, smooth surface, and broad size distribution. The controlled release of Se consisted of an initial burst followed by a gradual release over 48 h. Se-loaded nanoparticles presented significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to free Se. A 60-day feeding trial was conducted to compare the effects of supplementing different dietary Se sources, including selenomethionine (as organic source), sodium selenite (as inorganic source), and Se-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (Se-Nano and Se-Nano x1.5) on antioxidant and growth responses of Nile tilapia. A basal diet without Se supplementation was used as the control. The dietary supplementations with different Se sources (free and encapsulated selenium) lead to significant improvements in final weight and feed efficiency of Nile tilapia fingerlings. However, dietary treatments did not affect whole-body protein and lipid content. Diets containing Se-Nano and Se-Nano x1.5 were more effective than sodium selenite and selenomethionine in preventing oxidative stress and improving antioxidant activity in Nile tilapia. Overall, Se-loaded nanoparticles presented a great potential as an efficient source for delivering dietary Se to Nile tilapia, directly affecting the growth performance, feed efficiency, oxidative stress, and antioxidant activity of this species."

An Ensemble Classifier-Decision Tree (EC-DT) algorithm is proposed based on the single decision tree algorithm to analyze HRM data. The involved single decision tree algorithms include C4.5, Random Tree, J48, and SimpleCart. Then, an HRM system is established based on the designed algorithm, and the evaluation management and talent recommendation modules are tested. Finally, the designed algorithm is compared and tested. Experimental results suggest that C4.5 provides the highest classification accuracy among the single decision tree algorithms, reaching 76.69%; in contrast, the designed EC-DT algorithm can provide a classification accuracy of 79.97%. The proposed EC-DT algorithm is compared with the Content-based Recommendation Method (CRM) and the Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Method (CFRM), revealing that its Data Mining Recommendation Method (DMRM) can provide the highest accuracy and recall, reaching 35.2% and 41.6%, respectively. Therefore, the data mining-based HRM system can promote and guide enterprises to develop according to quantitative evaluation results. The above results can provide a reference for studying HRM systems based on data mining technology."
https://openalex.org/W3118766766,"Facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool."
https://openalex.org/W3161782229,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a pivotal role as molecular chaperones against unfavorable conditions. Although HSPs are of great importance, their computational identification remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have two major limitations. First, they relied heavily on amino acid composition features, which inevitably limited their prediction performance. Second, their prediction performance was overestimated because of the independent two-stage evaluations and train-test data redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two novel deep learning algorithms: (1) time-efficient DeepHSP and (2) high-performance DeeperHSP. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DeepHSP that classifies both non-HSPs and six HSP families simultaneously. It outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, despite taking 14-15 times less time for both training and inference. We further improve the performance of DeepHSP by taking advantage of protein transfer learning. While DeepHSP is trained on raw protein sequences, DeeperHSP is trained on top of pre-trained protein representations. Therefore, DeeperHSP remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms increasing F1 scores in both cross-validation and independent test experiments by 20% and 10%, respectively. We envision that the proposed algorithms can provide a proteome-wide prediction of HSPs and help in various downstream analyses for pathology and clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W3162086228,"It is widely recognized that innate macrophage immune reactions to implant debris are central to the inflammatory responses that drive biologic implant failure over the long term. Less common, adaptive lymphocyte immune reactions to implant debris, such as delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), can also affect implant performance. It is unknown which key patient factors, if any, mediate these adaptive immune responses that potentiate particle/macrophage mediated osteolysis. The objective of this investigation was to determine to what degree known adaptive immune responses to metal implant debris can affect particle-induced osteolysis (PIO); and if this pathomechanism is dependent on: 1) innate immune danger signaling, i.e., NLRP3 inflammasome activity, 2) sex, and/or 3) age. We used an established murine calvaria model of PIO using male and female wild-type C57BL/6 vs. Caspase-1 deficient mice as well as young (12–16 weeks old) vs. aged (18–24 months old) female and male C57BL/6 mice. After induction of metal-DTH, and Cobalt-alloy particle (ASTM F-75, 0.4um median diameter) calvaria challenge, bone resorption was assessed using quantitative micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis and immune responses were assessed by measuring paw inflammation, lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) reactivity and adaptive immune cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-17 (ELISA). Younger aged C57BL/6 female mice exhibited the highest rate and severity of metal sensitivity lymphocyte responses that also translated into higher PIO compared to any other experimental group. The absence of inflammasome/caspase-1 activity significantly suppressed DTH metal-reactivity and osteolysis in both male and female Caspase-1 deficient mice. These murine model results indicate that young female mice are more predisposed to metal-DTH augmented inflammatory responses to wear debris, which is highly influenced by active NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1 danger signaling. If these results are clinically meaningful for orthopedic patients, then younger female individuals should be appropriately assessed and followed for DTH derived peri-implant complications."
https://openalex.org/W3162613106,"Macroautophagy (hereafter, autophagy) is a process that directs the degradation of cytoplasmic material in lysosomes. In addition to its homeostatic roles, autophagy undergoes dynamic positive and negative regulation in response to multiple forms of cellular stress, thus enabling the survival of cells. However, the precise mechanisms of autophagy regulation are not fully understood. To identify potential negative regulators of autophagy, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen using the quantitative autophagic flux reporter GFP-LC3-RFP. We identified phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase, a component of the de novo purine synthesis pathway, as one such negative regulator of autophagy. Autophagy was activated in cells lacking phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, another de novo purine synthesis enzyme, or treated with methotrexate when exogenous levels of purines were insufficient. Purine starvation-induced autophagy activation was concomitant with mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) suppression and was profoundly suppressed in cells deficient for tuberous sclerosis complex 2, which negatively regulates mTORC1 through inhibition of Ras homolog enriched in brain, suggesting that purines regulate autophagy through the tuberous sclerosis complex-Ras homolog enriched in brain-mTORC1 signaling axis. Moreover, depletion of the pyrimidine synthesis enzymes carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activated autophagy as well, although mTORC1 activity was not altered by pyrimidine shortage. These results suggest a different mechanism of autophagy induction between purine and pyrimidine starvation. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of autophagy by nucleotides and possibly the role of autophagy in nucleotide metabolism, leading to further developing anticancer strategies involving nucleotide synthesis and autophagy.

Moreover, depletion of the pyrimidine synthesis enzymes carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activated autophagy as well, although mTORC1 activity was not altered by pyrimidine shortage. These results suggest a different mechanism of autophagy induction between purine and pyrimidine starvation. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of autophagy by nucleotides and possibly the role of autophagy in nucleotide metabolism, leading to further developing anticancer strategies involving nucleotide synthesis and autophagy. Macroautophagy (hereafter, autophagy) is an intracellular degradation system in which cytoplasmic materials are delivered to and degraded by the lysosome (1Mizushima N. Komatsu M. Autophagy: Renovation of cells and tissues.Cell. 2011; 147: 728-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Autophagy is responsible for the turnover of proteins and organelles and provides cells with an alternate source of nutrients for cellular renovation and homeostasis. Autophagy occurs constitutively at low levels to perform housekeeping functions, such as the degradation of dysfunctional organelles, and is upregulated in response to multiple forms of cellular stress (2Kroemer G. Marino G. Levine B. Autophagy and the integrated stress response.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar), thereby serving as an essential survival mechanism. This dynamic regulation of autophagy requires both positive and negative regulators. In addition to autophagy-related (ATG) proteins (3Mizushima N. A brief history of autophagy from cell biology to physiology and disease.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), many factors have been reported to positively regulate autophagy, including the endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins VMP1 (4Ropolo A.

Among the most important negative regulators of autophagy is mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central regulator of cell growth (14Jung C.H. Ro S.H. Cao J. Otto N.M. Kim D.H. mTOR regulation of autophagy.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). mTORC1 is the master regulator of autophagy, and its suppression is the key signal for inducing autophagy. Although few in number, there have been other reports of negative regulators functioning across multiple levels within the autophagy cascade. For example, Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes by joining the PI3KC3-C2 complex, which includes UVRAG, Beclin 1, VPS15, and VPS34 (15Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M.

A recent genome-wide screen unintentionally discovered a novel negative regulatory pathway of autophagy, mediated through ubiquitination of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) (18Jia R.

Our study aimed to identify additional negative regulators of autophagy by employing a genome-wide CRISPR screen. Our nonbiased screening identified the de novo purine synthesis enzyme phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) as a negative regulator of autophagy. We demonstrate in this study that purine starvation, which is caused by the complete loss of purine supply, induces autophagy activation. Our data suggest that lack of nucleotide synthesis profoundly impacts autophagy, elucidating a novel aspect of autophagy regulation. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen for negative regulators of autophagy. In the screen, we used the GFP-LC3-RFP autophagic flux reporter (Fig. 1A) (35Kaizuka T. Morishita H. Hama Y. Tsukamoto S. Matsui T. Toyota Y. Kodama A. Ishihara T. Mizushima T. Mizushima N. An autophagic flux probe that releases an internal control.Mol. Cell. 2016; 64: 835-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Endogenous ATG4 proteins, which function as proteases, cleave the GFP-LC3-RFP reporter, yielding equimolar amounts of GFP-LC3 and RFP. Subsequently, GFP-LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagic membranes and delivered to lysosomes, where the GFP signal is quenched. RFP stays in the cytosol and serves as an internal control. Thus, autophagic flux can be visualized by measuring the GFP:RFP ratio using flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). To validate the screen, we performed a LentiCRISPR-mediated bulk knockout of a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line stably expressing GFP-LC3-RFP and Cas9 (HEK293T GFP-LC3-RFP cells) with a LentiCRISPR vector comprising single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting previously known negative regulators of autophagy. After the introduction of sgRNAs targeting RRAGA (a gene coding RAGA, a positive regulator of mTORC1 (36Efeyan A. Schweitzer L.D. Bilate A.M. Chang S. Kirak O. Lamming D.W. Sabatini D.M. Raga, but not RagB, is essential for embryonic development and adult mice.Dev. Cell. 2014; 29: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) and BRD4 (a gene coding BRD4, a transcriptional repressor of autophagy (17Sakamaki J.I. Wilkinson S.

Cell. 2017; 66: 517-532.e519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the number of autophagy-activated cells with a low GFP:RFP ratio was increased (indicated by the region of interest) (Fig. 1C). For bulk knockouts, the phenotypes were observed according to the mutagenic efficiency of the transduced sgRNA, with limited effects on the GFP:RFP ratio of the entire population. For the screen, HEK293T GFP-LC3-RFP cells were transduced with the human genome-scale CRISPR knockout (GeCKO) library, a pooled LentiCRISPR library comprising 123,411 sgRNAs targeting 19,050 human genes (six sgRNAs per gene) (20Shalem O. Sanjana N.E. Hartenian E. Shi X. Scott D.A. Mikkelson T. Heckl D. Ebert B.L. Root D.E. Doench J.G. Zhang F. Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells.Science. 2014; 343: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar, 37Sanjana N.E. Shalem O. Zhang F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 783-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected using puromycin. After 2 weeks of culture, the cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Cells gated in the autophagy-activated population, whose GFP signal decreased under nutrient-replete conditions, were collected. Sorting was repeated four times, at 2-week intervals (Fig. 1D). Genomic DNA was isolated from unsorted cells (control) and sorted cells (autophagy activated), and the sgRNA region was subjected to next-generation sequencing analysis. We performed the screen twice and plotted the abundance of each sgRNA (Fig. 1E and Table S1). GABARAP, a gene coding the mammalian Atg8 homolog γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (38Slobodkin M.R. Elazar Z. The Atg8 family: Multifunctional ubiquitin-like key regulators of autophagy.Essays Biochem. 2013; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), scored highly in both replicates. This is likely because GABARAP competes with the GFP-LC3-RFP reporter to associate with autophagosomal membranes (see Discussion). Genes coding previously reported negative regulators of autophagy, such as the components of mTORC1 and BRD4, were not detected (see Discussion). For the selection of candidate genes for the secondary screening, read counts were computationally analyzed by model-based analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (MAGeCK) (39Li W. Xu H. Xiao T. Cong L. Love M.I. Zhang F. Irizarry R.A. Liu J.S. Brown M. Liu X.S. MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table S2), and the top enriched genes were determined (Table S3). Additionally, based on the scatterplot, genes highly enriched in both replicates were defined as indicated in the rectangle (>−5 log2 fold-change in both replicates) (Fig. 1E). To avoid noise from low-count sgRNAs, sgRNAs with fewer than 30 read counts in the unsorted cells were filtered out (Fig. 1F). Genes with more than two corresponding sgRNAs remaining after processing were recorded (Table S4). From these lists, we selected a total of 21 candidate genes for the secondary screen (Fig. 1, E and F, Tables S2 and S3). Genes rarely expressed in HEK293T cells were excluded (using the published Human Protein Atlas database (40Thul P.J. Åkesson L. Wiking M. Mahdessian D. Geladaki A. Ait Blal H. Alm T. Asplund A. Björk L. Breckels L.M. Bäckström A. Danielsson F. Fagerberg L. Fall J. Gatto L. et al.A subcellular map of the human proteome.Science. 2017; 356eaal3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar)). For the secondary screen, HEK293T GFP-LC3-RFP cells were transduced with two independent sgRNAs against each candidate gene. In addition to the 21 candidate genes, RHEB (an activator of mTORC1 (41Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. TOR signaling in growth and metabolism.Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4369) Google Scholar)) was added as a positive control. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the ratio of the autophagy-activated population to the total population was measured (Fig. 2, A and B). A significant increase in the autophagy-activated population was observed in cells transduced with two sgRNAs for GABARAP and one sgRNA each for RHEB and PFAS. PFAS encodes PFAS, a de novo purine synthesis enzyme (Fig. 3A). Cells depleted of PFAS show defects in de novo purine synthesis and are dependent on the purine salvage pathway for cell growth (42Ali E.S. Sahu U. Villa E. O’Hara B.P. Gao P. Beaudet C. Wood A.W. Asara J.M. Ben-Sahra I. ERK2 phosphorylates PFAS to mediate posttranslational control of de novo purine synthesis.Mol. Cell. 2020; 78: 1178-1191.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, except for in the screens, cells lacking de novo purine synthesis were maintained in a medium supplemented with 100 μM hypoxanthine before analysis. To confirm the specific effect of PFAS knockout, we established a PFAS-KO HEK293T cell clone and then introduced the GFP-LC3-RFP autophagic flux reporter. When cultured in a normal culture medium (without hypoxanthine supplementation) for 2 days, the PFAS-KO clone showed a clear decline in the GFP:RFP signal ratio, which indicated upregulation of autophagic flux (Fig. 3B). This decline was restored by exogenous expression of PFAS-FLAG. These data confirm that the positive results of PFAS knockout in the second screen were not caused by off-target effects. In addition, LentiCRISPR-mediated bulk knockout of PFAS was performed in HeLa and U-2 OS cells expressing the GFP-LC3-RFP reporter. Autophagy activation was observed in both cell lines, suggesting that activation of autophagy by PFAS depletion is not specific to HEK293T (Fig. 3C) To specify the cause of autophagy activation in PFAS-depleted cells, we performed a LentiCRISPR-mediated bulk knockout of PPAT, a gene encoding phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), another essential enzyme in the de novo purine synthesis pathway (Fig. 3A). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of de novo purine synthesis was performed using methotrexate (Fig. 3A). Bulk knockout of PPAT and methotrexate treatment both induced autophagy activation (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of autophagy observed in PFAS-KO cells involves the impairment of the de novo purine synthesis pathway. Hoxhaj et al. (43Hoxhaj G. Hughes-Hallett J. Timson R.C. Ilagan E. Yuan M. Asara J.M. Ben-Sahra I. Manning B.D. The mTORC1 signaling network senses changes in cellular purine nucleotide levels.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 1331-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) previously reported that when exogenous purines are depleted, cells deficient in de novo purine synthesis show decreased intracellular purine levels. Therefore, we investigated whether autophagy is activated in response to the depletion of extracellular purine levels in PFAS-KO cells. To exclude the effects of exogenous purines contained in conventional culture media containing 10% serum (estimated to be approximately 7.5 μM (44Harkness R.A. Simmonds R.J. Gough P. Priscott P.K. Squire J.A. Purine base and nucleoside, cytidine and uridine concentrations in foetal calf and other sera [proceedings].Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 139Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)), we used a purine-depleted medium supplemented with dialyzed serum. Activation of autophagy in PFAS-depleted cells was observed when they were cultured with less than 10 μM exogenous hypoxanthine but was canceled in the presence of sufficient hypoxanthine (more than 30 μM) (Fig. 4, A and B). Additionally, sufficient amounts of exogenous hypoxanthine suppressed the lysosomal turnover of endogenous LC3, observed by the accumulation of endogenous LC3-II upon treatment with lysosomal protease inhibitors, Pepstatin A and E64d (Fig. 4, C and D), and the formation of GFP-LC3 puncta (Fig. 4, E and F). Given that cells deficient in de novo purine synthesis are dependent on the salvage pathway, PFAS-KO cells cultured in a purine-insufficient medium should have been subjected to intracellular purine-starvation conditions. These data suggest that the decline of intracellular purine levels, caused by purine starvation, activates autophagy. Aside from hypoxanthine, sufficient amounts (more than 30 μM) of exogenous inosine, inosine monophosphate, and adenine could completely cancel the autophagy activation, whereas the effect of guanine was limited (Fig. 4G). Together with our findings on purine synthesis pathways (Fig. 3A), the unavailability of hypoxanthine or adenine and their derivatives could mediate purine starvation-induced autophagy. Next, we investigated the mechanism of autophagy activation in purine-starved cells. Recent studies have shown that depletion of intracellular purine bases via inhibition of purine synthesis pathways suppresses mTORC1 (43Hoxhaj G. Hughes-Hallett J. Timson R.C. Ilagan E. Yuan M.

Therefore, we investigated whether the activation of autophagy is concomitant with the downregulation of mTORC1 in PFAS-depleted cells. Consistent with previous studies, mTORC1 activity was downregulated in PFAS-KO cells depleted of purines, as assessed from the phosphorylation status of its substrates p70 S6-kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (Fig. 5A). mTORC1 activity was restored by hypoxanthine treatment or expression of PFAS–FLAG. Previous studies have suggested that purines regulate mTORC1 in a manner dependent on the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex and Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB) (43Hoxhaj G.

https://openalex.org/W3163310202,"Oesophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the world. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most prevalent histological type of oesophageal cancer. Oesophageal cancer has a poor prognosis because of its invasiveness. Thus, it is especially important to seek effective treatment methods. Research indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a significant role in the occurrence and development of oesophageal cancer. The aim of this study was to describe the role of LINC00958 in ESCC. Bioinformatics and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) methods were utilized to predict and verify the expression of LINC00958 in ESCC. Related functional experiments, including cell proliferation, migration and invasion, were performed. In addition, a western blot and a dual luciferase reporter gene experiment were used to study the detailed carcinogenic mechanism of LINC00958. The results indicated there was a high expression of LINC00958 in ESCC, which promoted proliferation, migration, invasion and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of ESCC cells, and this effect may be via regulating miR-510-5p."
https://openalex.org/W3163857020,"Last decade has witnessed three major pandemics caused by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV that belong to Coronavirus family. Currently, there are no effective therapies available for corona virus infections. Since the three viruses belong to the same family and share many common features, we can theoretically design a drug that can be effective on all the three of them. In this study, using computational approach, we designed a peptide (Peptide 7) that can bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV thereby preventing the entry of the viruses into the host cell. The peptide inhibitor was designed as a consensus peptide from three different peptides that might individually bind to the RBD of the three viruses. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations using Peptide 7 has shown that it binds with higher affinity than the native receptors of the RBD and forms a stable complex thereby preventing further viral-receptor interaction and inhibiting their cellular entry. This effective binding is observed for the three RBDs, despite the Peptide 7 interactions being slightly different. Hence; this peptide inhibitor can be used as a potential candidate for the development of peptide based anti-viral therapy against Corona viruses."

Emergency departments (EDs), recognized as essential venues for HIV screening, may play a unique role in identifying undiagnosed HIV among PWID, who frequently present for complications of injection drug use (IDU). Our objective was to describe changes in HIV diagnoses among PWID detected by an ED HIV screening program and estimate the program's contribution to HIV diagnoses among PWID county-wide during the emergence of a regional HIV outbreak.This was a retrospective study of electronically queried clinical records from an urban, safety-net ED's HIV screening program and publicly available HIV surveillance data for its surrounding county, Hamilton County, Ohio. Outcomes included the change in number of HIV diagnoses and the ED's contribution to case identification county-wide, overall and for PWID during 2014-2018.During 2014-2018, the annual number of HIV diagnoses made by the ED program increased from 20 to 42 overall, and from 1 to 18 for PWID. We estimated that the ED contributed 18% of HIV diagnoses in the county and 22% of diagnoses among PWID.The ED program contributed 1 in 5 new HIV diagnoses among PWID county-wide, further illustrating the importance of ED HIV screening programs in identifying undiagnosed HIV infections. In areas experiencing increasing IDU, HIV screening in EDs can provide an early indication of increasing HIV diagnoses among PWID and can substantially contribute to case-finding during an HIV outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3161825659,"There is increasing interest in the role of mindfulness and mindfulness-based interventions to optimize recovery from a substance use disorder (SUD). However, relatively little is known about the theory-based psychological and social pathways whereby mindfulness could have beneficial effects for managing a chronic, relapsing SUD. Informed by Revised Stress and Coping Theory, the present cross-sectional study examined affective, cognitive, and social pathways whereby mindfulness is associated with lower methamphetamine craving. A total of 161 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using sexual minority men completed a screening visit for a randomized controlled trial. Using a hybrid structural equation model, we examined pathways whereby mindfulness is associated with lower methamphetamine craving. We found that greater mindfulness was directly associated with lower negative affect and higher positive affect as well as indirectly associated with less methamphetamine craving. Interestingly, the indirect association between mindfulness and methamphetamine craving appeared to be uniquely attributable to positive affect. Only positive affect was indirectly associated with lower methamphetamine craving via higher positive re-appraisal coping and greater self-efficacy for managing triggers for methamphetamine use. Methamphetamine craving was supported by moderate associations with greater substance use severity and more frequent methamphetamine use. These findings support the role of mindfulness in cultivating positive affect, which could be crucial to build the capacity of individuals to manage methamphetamine craving as a chronic stressor that threatens recovery from SUD."
https://openalex.org/W3160957173,"To explore women's experiences and perspectives of reproductive healthcare in prison.We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured focus groups in 2018 with women in a provincial prison in Ontario, Canada. We asked participants about their experiences and perspectives of pregnancy and contraception related to healthcare in prison. We used a combination of deductive and inductive content analysis to categorize data. A concept map was generated using a reproductive justice framework.The data reflected three components of a reproductive justice framework: 1) women have limited access to healthcare in prison, 2) reproductive safety and dignity influence attitudes toward pregnancy and contraception, and 3) women in prison want better reproductive healthcare. Discrimination and stigma were commonly invoked throughout women's experiences in seeking reproductive healthcare.Improving reproductive healthcare for women in prison is crucial to promoting reproductive justice in this population. Efforts to increase access to comprehensive, responsive, and timely reproductive healthcare should be informed by the needs and desires of women in prison and should actively seek to reduce their experience of discrimination and stigma in this context."
https://openalex.org/W3163804295,"This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone as axillary surgery regardless of their clinical and pathological lymph node status. We reviewed the records of 1,795 patients from Asan Medical Center who were diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy during 2003-2014. We selected 760 patients who underwent SLNB alone as axillary surgery and divided these patients into four groups according to their clinical lymph node (cN) and pathological lymph node (pN) status: cN(-)pN(-) (n = 377), cN(-)pN(+) (n = 33), cN(+)pN(-) (n = 242), and cN(+)pN(+) (n = 108). We then compared axillary lymph node recurrence, locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) among the four groups using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We compared prognosis between the cN(-)pN(-) and cN(+)pN(-) groups to determine whether SLNB alone is an adequate treatment modality even in patients with cN positive pathology before neoadjuvant therapy but SLNB-negative pathology after NAC. The 5-year axillary recurrence rates in the cN(-)pN(-) and cN(+)pN(-) groups were 1.4% and 2.9%, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.152). The axillary recurrence and LRR rates were significantly different among the four groups, with the pN-negative groups (cN[-]pN[-], cN[+]pN[-]) showing lower recurrence rates. DMFS and OS were also significantly different among the four groups, with the cN negative groups (cN[-]pN[-], cN[-]pN[+]) showing improved survival rates. Our study findings suggest that SLNB alone was associated with lower LRR rates even in patients with cN positive pathology before neoadjuvant therapy but cN negative pathology after SLNB. Moreover, recurrence and survival rates differ significantly according to clinical and pathological lymph node status."

We seek to investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the high altitude areas of Sichuan, China. In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 67 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in Sichuan’s Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture were included from February 1, 2020, to March 2, 2020. Their clinical characteristics, as well as radiological and laboratory features, were extracted. Four (6.0%) patients were categorized as severe cases; 39 (58.2%) were non-severe cases, and 24 (35.8%) were asymptomatic cases. A total of 46 (68.7%) patients were associated with cluster infection events in this study. The most common symptoms were cough, sputum production, dyspnea, fatigue or myalgia, and headache. Seven (10.4%) patients showed leucopenia, and 20 (29.9%) patients showed lymphopenia. Lymphocyte counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NPR) were different between the three groups. In total, 14 (20.9%) patients had thrombocytopenia, and prothrombin times (PT) and fibrinogen levels differed between groups. We also found significant differences in sodium, chloride and calcium levels between the three groups. Antiviral therapy did not lead to obvious adverse events or shortened durations from initial positive to subsequent negative nuclei acid tests. Advanced age, hypertension, high neutrophil count, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, fibrinogen and lactate dehydrogenase levels were identified as independent risk factors for symptomatic cases of COVID-19. In conclusion, the symptoms of patients in high altitude areas were mild, and about one third were asymptomatic. We also identified several independent risk factors for symptomatic cases of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3163948916,"Quick identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is central to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, this resource-intensive and relatively lengthy technique is not ideally suited for mass testing. While pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized testing remains elusive. To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying proportions of positive and negative samples. We observed that 5-sample pool testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one positive sample. We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive samples in 125 pools. With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively. Since the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively. These observations led us to conclude that 4-sample pool testing offers the optimal blend of resource optimization and diagnostic performance across difference disease prevalence settings."

Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1s) play a crucial role in not only membrane excitability in the nervous system but also muscle and endocrine cells. Nav1s are composed of a main (α) subunit and associated auxiliary (β1–4) subunits. The α subunit is comprised of four homologous domains, with each containing a voltage sensor, and a pore that is highly selective for sodium ions—a selectivity for sodium over 1000 times higher than for potassium and calcium ions. To date, there are ten Nav1 α subunit genes identified in mammals with their expressions regulated in tissue-specific and cell type–specific manner (1Catterall W.A. Voltage-gated sodium channels at 60: Structure, function and pathophysiology.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 2577-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Nav1s were first characterized in the squid giant axon by Hodgkin and Huxley (2Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (13430) Google Scholar), who established the fundamental concepts in membrane excitability: “ion-selective pore” and “voltage sensor.” Since then, the basic properties of Nav1s, including their gating kinetics and ion permeation, have also been characterized in other invertebrates, such as snail neurons as well as the eggs of starfish and ascidians, which were advantageous to use because of their large cell size in two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) experiments, during a time before the age of patch clamping (3Okamoto H.

CiNav1a showed tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive sodium currents with very rapid gating of activation and inactivation. Coexpression of human β1 (hβ1) subunit did not affect the gating properties of CiNav1a, consistent with the fact that Ciona genome lacks orthologous gene to vertebrate β subunit genes (24Okamura Y.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis using the predicted amino acid sequences of the identified genes revealed that the three paralogs, CiNav1a, CiNav1b, CiNav1c, are at a relatively close position to the clade of vertebrate Nav1 channels (Fig. 1A). The other one, CiNav2, is closely related to the clade of Nav2 including BSC1 of cockroach Blattella and TuNa2, the previously identified Nav channel–like gene from another ascidian Halocynthia (Fig. 1A) (27Nishino A.

Because the full length is long, we obtained two (5’ and 3’) cDNA fragments for covering the full-length cDNA using two sets of PCR primers (see Experimental procedures section for details). The deduced primary structure of CiNav1a was of 2323 amino acids. Critical regions for Nav1 functions are more evidently conserved in CiNav1a than in CiNav1b and CiNav1c (Fig. 1B). Those critical regions include the pore turrets for ion selectivity in the S5–S6 loop from each quadrant of the four repetitive domains (I–IV) with the signature D/E/K/A as found in other typical Nav1s, and also the S4 for voltage sensing, ABM in the II–III loop (32Garrido J.J.

A. 1992; 89: 10910-10914Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Those critical regions were also conserved in TuNa1 (BAA04133) of Halocynthia and mostly in a putative ortholog (CBY22707) of Oikopleura (which belong to another tunicate group of ascidians). These characteristics suggest that CiNav1a represents an original chordate type of Nav1 that retains basic molecular functions inherited to all vertebrate Nav1 isoforms (Fig. 1). Expressing full-length CiNav1a mRNA in Xenopus oocytes, we performed TEVC to record sodium currents. Cells that expressed CiNav1a exhibited typical voltage-gated sodium currents with rapid activation and inactivation (Fig. 2). CiNav1a is grouped in the same clade as the previously characterized ascidian sodium channel, TuNa1 from Halocynthia roretzi (Fig. 1A), which was reported to be TTX insensitive in native neural cells (12Okamura Y. Ono F. Okagaki R. Chong J.A. Mandel G. Neural expression of a sodium channel gene requires cell-specific interactions.Neuron. 1994; 13: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Applying 10 μM TTX suppressed the peak inward current of CiNav1a expressed in Xenopus oocytes by less than 5%, whereas it completely inhibited currents of rat Nav1.4 (rNav1.4) (Fig. 2, B and C). This result indicates that CiNav1a is almost insensitive to TTX. CiNav1a cDNA transfected into human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells failed to express functional Nav current (data not shown). In mammals, β subunits are known to increase cell surface expression and modify the gating properties of α subunits. To examine the effects of β subunit on CiNav1a, we performed cut-open oocyte recording and compared sodium currents between cells expressing only CiNav1a and cells coexpressing CiNav1a with hβ1. rNav1.4 (also called μ1) and human Nav1.5 (hNav1.5, also called hH1) were tested as positive controls known to be modulated by β1 subunits. To test the effects of hβ1, we first verified the functional expression of hβ1 by observing its known influences on the current decay of rNav1.4, which was remarkedly accelerated (Figs. 3A and 4B). In contrast, hβ1 did not alter the current decay kinetics of CiNav1a (Fig. 4B). The current–voltage (I–V) curve and activation speed (Fig. 3, B and C and Fig. S1) were not significantly different between cells only expressing CiNav1a and those coexpressing with hβ1. Steady-state inactivation of CiNav1a (Fig. 4A) as examined by recording in cut-open oocyte also showed no difference between the presence and absence of hβ1 (CiNav1a: V_half = −46.39 ± 0.2931 [mV]; k [slope factor] = 4.001 ± 0.2253 [mV]; N = 5; CiNav1a + hβ1: V_half = −49.03 ± 0.4525 [mV]; k = 3.958 ± 0.4790 [mV]; N = 7, as fitted with Boltzmann function [mean ± SD]). Consistent with previously reported data (35Qu Y. Isom L.L. Westenbroek R.E. Rogers J.C. Tanada T.N. McCormick K.A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25696-25701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), fits of the recovery time course required two exponential components in rNav1.4. hβ1 accelerated the recovery from inactivation of hNav1.5 as examined at −100 mV (hNav1.5: tau1 = 20.64 ± 11.443 ms, tau2 = 868.666 ± 1057.546 ms, N = 5; hNav1.5 + hβ1: tau1 = 9.861 ± 1.455 ms, tau2 = 821.217 ± 442.856 ms, N = 7, in fitting with double exponential function [mean ± SD]), whereas no significant difference was observed in the recovery from inactivation in cells expressing CiNav1a with or without hβ1 (CiNav1a: tau = 2.151 ± 0.702 ms, N = 10; CiNav1a + hβ1: tau = 2.401 ± 0.687 ms, N = 9, in fitting with single exponential function [mean ± SD]) (tau1, tau2, tau are time constant of each exponential component) (Fig. 4, C and D). We also tried to coexpress CiNav1a with hβ1 in HEK293T cells but failed to observe functional currents. Although ascidians are more closely related to vertebrates than to insects, we tested for possible effects of insect Nav1 auxiliary subunit, TipE (36Feng G. Deak P. Kasbekar D.P. Gil D.W. Hall L.M. Cytogenetic and molecular localization of tipE: A gene affecting sodium channels in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1995; 139: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on the molecular functions of CiNav1a. TipE drastically enhanced the current expression of Drosophila Nav1 Para (Fig. 5A), whereas it did not change the current amplitude of CiNav1a (Fig. 5B). In addition, coexpression with TipE did not lead to any significant change of the I–V curve, activation speed, and decay kinetics of CiNav1a (Fig. 5, B–D). We examined the gene expression pattern of CiNav1a using whole-mount in situ hybridization. Corresponding to the expression pattern of H. roretzi TuNa1, which was exclusively expressed in larval neurons (12Okamura Y. Ono F. Okagaki R. Chong J.A. Mandel G. Neural expression of a sodium channel gene requires cell-specific interactions.Neuron. 1994; 13: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), CiNav1a expression signals were found in the cells of larval central and peripheral nervous systems, which include presumptive central neurons in the brain vesicle and motor ganglion, as well as peripheral neurons, such as epidermal sensory neurons in the surface of trunk and tail and bipolar tail neurons located in the peripheral nervous system (Fig. 6). In addition, CiNav1a mRNA was expressed in juvenile cerebral ganglion as examined by RT-PCR (data not shown). This is supported by mRNA expression profile in the expressed sequence tag database of Ciona (http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/fordetailht1.cgi?name=KY.Chr9.756.v1.SL1-1). Coexpression of CiNav1a with CiKv1b (one of shaker-related K+ channels in Ciona) in Xenopus oocyte showed action potentials (Fig. 7). These suggest that CiNav1a plays a substantial role in generating action potentials in ascidian neurons. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences from chordate Nav1s suggest that CiNav1a has an ABM in the II–III linker (27Nishino A. Okamura Y. Evolutionary history of voltage-gated sodium channels.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2018; 246: 3-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33Hill A.S. Nishino A. Nakajo K. Zhang G. Fineman J.R.

AIS was identified by positive signal of immunostaining with anti–ankyrin-G antibody (38Jenkins S.M. Bennett V.

CiNav1a–II–III linker–YFP signal overlapped with ankyrin-G signal (Fig. 8), which suggest that the II–III linker of CiNav1a can be targeted to AIS of rat cortical neurons.

However, early detection of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during CPR using waveform capnography remains a challenge. The aim of the study was to investigate if the assessment of ETCO2 variation during chest compression pauses could allow for ROSC detection. We hypothesized that a decay in ETCO2 during a compression pause indicates no ROSC while a constant or increasing ETCO2 indicates ROSC.We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) episodes treated by the advanced life support (ALS). Continuous chest compressions and ventilations were provided manually. Segments of capnography signal during pauses in chest compressions were selected, including at least three ventilations and with durations less than 20 s. Segments were classified as ROSC or non-ROSC according to case chart annotation and examination of the ECG and transthoracic impedance signals. The percentage variation of ETCO2 between consecutive ventilations was computed and its average value, ΔETavg, was used as a single feature to discriminate between ROSC and non-ROSC segments.A total of 384 segments (130 ROSC, 254 non-ROSC) from 205 OHCA patients (30.7% female, median age 66) were analyzed. Median (IQR) duration was 16.3 (12.9,18.1) s. ΔETavg was 0.0 (-0.7, 0.9)% for ROSC segments and -11.0 (-14.1, -8.0)% for non-ROSC segments (p < 0.0001). Best performance for ROSC detection yielded a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI: 90.1%, 98.1%) and a specificity of 94.9% (91.4%, 97.1%) for all ventilations in the segment. For the first 2 ventilations, duration was 7.7 (6.0, 10.2) s, and sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (83.5%, 94.2%) and 89.4 (84.9%, 92.6%), respectively. Our method allowed for ROSC detection during the first compression pause in 95.4% of the patients.Average percent variation of ETCO2 during pauses in chest compressions allowed for ROSC discrimination. This metric could help confirm ROSC during compression pauses in ALS settings."
https://openalex.org/W3160095560,"Adelgidae are a sister group of Aphididae and Phylloxeridae within Hemiptera, Aphidoidea and occur exclusively on Pinaceae. The piercing-sucking mouthparts of Adelgidae are similar to those of aphids and it is believed that adelgids ingest sap from both the non-vascular and vascular (phloem) tissues. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize the adelgid stylet activities during their penetration in plant tissues. The probing behavior of Adelges laricis Vallot (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) on European larch Larix decidua Mill. and sucrose diets was monitored using the DC-EPG (Electrical Penetration Graph technique = electropenetrography). The EPG waveforms were described based on amplitude, frequency, voltage level, and electrical origin of the observed traces, and associated with putative behavioral activities based on analogy with aphid activities. Waveform frequency, duration, and sequence were analysed as well. A. laricis generated EPG signals at two clearly distinct voltage levels positive and negative, suggesting extracellular and intracellular stylet penetration, respectively. The adelgid EPG patterns were ascribed to four behavioral phases, which were non-probing, pathway, phloem, and xylem phases. Non-probing referred to the position of the stylets outside the plant tissues. Pathway phase was represented by three waveform patterns that visualized extracellular stylet penetration in non-vascular tissues without potential drops (AC1), with serial short (1.2-1.5 s) potential drops (AC2), and with 'aphid-like' (5-10 s) potential drops (AC3). Phloem phase comprised three waveform patterns at intracellular level, which in all probability represented phloem salivation (AE1), and phloem sap passive (AE2) and active ingestion (AE3). AE3 was a newly described waveform, previously unreported from Hemiptera. Waveform AG represented the ingestion of xylem sap. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the gymnosperm-associated adelgids show certain similarities in probing behavior typical of aphids and phylloxerids on angiosperm plants. The present work is the first detailed analysis of specific adelgid stylet activities on gymnosperms."

However, a preponderance of voice research focuses on employee voice with little attention paid to voice endorsement. Building on the social persuasion theory of the elaboration likelihood model, we systematically examine the sender and receiver determinants of voice endorsement and how the interplay of those determinants affects voice endorsement. By empirically analyzing 168 paired samples, we find that issue-relevant information, i.e., voicer credibility, has a positive effect on voice endorsement and matters most when leaders have high felt obligation. The results also show that the peripheral cue used in the study, i.e., positive mood, has a positive effect on voice endorsement and matters most when leaders have low felt obligation or low cognitive flexibility. We discuss the contributions of these findings and highlight limitations and directions for future research."

Longitudinal hierarchical model and Cox proportional-hazard model were adopted to examine patients’ adherence over their full five-year course of adjuvant hormone therapy. Results Our study cohort consisted of 1,133 dual eligible beneficiaries diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive early stage breast cancer in years 2007 –mid 2009. About 80.5% of them received MSPs benefits, while the rest received full Medicaid benefits. On average for a standardized 30-day hormone therapy medication, full Medicaid beneficiaries spent $0.5-$2.0 and MSP beneficiaries spent $1.4-$4.8 in copayment. After adjusting for other factors, this copayment reduction wasn’t associated with a significantly better adherence. However, when the catastrophic coverage threshold was reached (copayments reduced to zero), significant improvement in adherence was found in both groups. Conclusions Our study found that small amount of cost-sharing reduction did not affect Medicare and Medicaid dual eligible patients’ medication treatment adherence, however, the elimination of cost-sharing (even a minimal amount) was associated with improved adherence. Future legislative and advocacy efforts should be paid on eliminating cost sharing for dual eligibles, and possibly even a broader group of financially vulnerable patients."

Receipt of a physician skin examination was measured using a single question that asked participants whether they had ever had all of their skin from head to toe checked for cancer by a dermatologist or some other kind of doctor.Less than a third (30.88%) of participants reported ever having a physician skin examination. Factors positively associated with receipt of a physician skin examination in a multivariable logistic regression analysis included: older age, greater educational level, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, having TRICARE (military) health insurance, greater skin sensitivity to the sun, and engagement in more sun protection behaviors.The majority of military veterans have never been screened for skin cancer by a physician.

When cultured lactic acid bacteria are washed, heat-killed, and powdered, adhesion occurs between results in aggregation (non-treated lactic acid bacteria, n-LAB). However, dispersed lactic acid bacteria (d-LAB) with a lower number of aggregates can be prepared by treating them with a high-pressure homogenizer and adding an excipient during powdering. Mice were administered n-LAB or d-LAB Peyer's patches in the small intestine were observed. Following n-LAB administration, a high amount of aggregated bacteria drifting in the intestinal mucosa was observed; meanwhile, d-LAB reached the Peyer's patches and was absorbed into them. Evaluation in a mouse influenza virus infection model showed that d-LAB was more effective than n-LAB in the influenza yield of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids on day 3 post-infection and neutralizing antibody titers of sera and influenza virus-specific immunoglobulin A in the feces on day 14 post-infection. Therefore, the physical properties of lactic acid bacteria affect their efficacy; controlling their water dispersibility can improve their effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3162346812,"Throughout engineering there are problems where it is required to predict a quantity based on the measurement of another, but where the two quantities possess characteristic variations over vastly different ranges of time and space. Among the many challenges posed by such ‘multiscale’ problems, that of defining a ‘scale’ remains poorly addressed. This fundamental problem has led to much confusion in the field of biomedical engineering in particular. The present study proposes a definition of scale based on measurement limitations of existing instruments, available computational power, and on the ranges of time and space over which quantities of interest vary characteristically. The definition is used to construct a multiscale modelling methodology from start to finish, beginning with a description of the system (portion of reality of interest) and ending with an algorithmic orchestration of mathematical models at different scales within the system. The methodology is illustrated for a specific but well-researched problem. The concept of scale and the multiscale modelling approach introduced are shown to be easily adaptable to other closely related problems. Although out of the scope of this paper, we believe that the proposed methodology can be applied widely throughout engineering."

Performing the anastomosis of a single uterine vein could bring a therapeutic benefit and simplification of surgery and serve for managing unilateral venous thromboses. The objectives of this project were to evaluate the expression of early markers of ischemia-reperfusion and to compare findings following one or two vein anastomoses. Orthotopic uterine auto-transplantations were performed on an ovine model with anastomosis of either two (group 1) or one utero-ovarian veins (group 2). Blood gases, histology and ischemia- reperfusion markers transcripts (PTGS2, IL6, IL8, SOD2, C3, BAX/BCL2 and TLR4) were analyzed as well as PTGS2 protein expression using Western Blot and fluorescence immunolocalization on endometrial biopsies after 3h of reperfusion. Ten ewes were included in the experimentation, 4 were in group1, 3 in group 2, the others being sham operated controls. No significant differences were observed between the two phenotypes. Based on these results, the anastomosis of one single uterine vein appears to be an approach consistent with short-term graft survival. Further experiments will be needed to confirm the reliability of this approach, especially the long-term follow-up of the uterine graft including its ability to support gestation to term."
https://openalex.org/W3160098940,"The skeletal muscle mass has been shown to be affected by catecholamines, such as epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE), and isoproterenol (ISO). On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the causative substances of sepsis, induces muscle wasting via toll-like receptors expressed in skeletal muscle. Although catecholamines are frequently administered to critically ill patients, it is still incompletely understood how these drugs affect skeletal muscle during critical illness, including sepsis. Herein, we examined the direct effects of catecholamines on LPS-induced skeletal muscle wasting using the C2C12 myoblast cell line. Muscle wasting induced by catecholamines and/or LPS was analyzed by the use of the differentiated C2C12 myotubes, and its underlying mechanism was explored by immunoblotting analysis, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the TransAM kit for p-65 NF-κB. Epi augmented myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein loss and reduction of the myotube diameter induced by LPS. LPS induced C/EBPδ protein, Atrogin-1 and inteleukin-6 (IL-6), and these responses were potentiated by Epi. An IL-6 inhibitor, LMT28, suppressed the potentiating effect of Epi on the LPS-induced responses. NF-κB activity was induced by LPS, but was not affected by Epi and recombinant IL-6, and the NF-κB inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, abolished Atrogin-1 mRNA expression induced by LPS with or without Epi. NE and ISO also potentiated LPS-induced IL-6 and Atroign-1 mRNA expression. Carvedilol, a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, suppressed the facilitating effects of Epi on the Atrogin-1 mRNA induction by LPS, and abolished the effects of Epi on the MHC protein loss in the presence of LPS. It was concluded that Epi activates the β-adrenergic receptors in C2C12 myotubes and the IL-6-STAT3 pathway, leading to the augmentation of LPS-induced activation of the NF-κB- C/EBPδ-Atrogin-1 pathway and to the exacerbation of myotube wasting."
https://openalex.org/W3161461798,"Prey availability plays an important role in determining larval fish survival. Numerous studies have found close relationships between the density of mesozooplankton and larval fishes; however, emerging studies suggest that small-size zooplankton are more important prey for some larval fish species. One arising question is whether the size of zooplankton determines the relationship between zooplankton and larval fish community in natural environments. To address this question, we collected small-size (50-200 μm) zooplankton, mesozooplankton (> 330 μm), and larval fish using three different mesh-size (50, 330, 1000 μm, respectively) nets in the East China Sea, and examined their relationships in density. Both meso- and small-size zooplankton densities showed positive relationships with larval fish density, while the relationship is much stronger for the small-size zooplankton. Specifically, the smallest size classes (50-75 and 75-100 μm) of small-size zooplankton showed the highest positive relationships with larval fish density. Temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll-a concentration did not significantly explain larval fish density. Based on these findings, we demonstrate the importance of considering prey size when investigating prey availability for larval fishes."

The secondary aim of the study was to assess intraday and interday (test-retest) reliability of sEMG obtained from maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) test. We evaluated the intraday reliability of sEMG recordings obtained during sessions 1 and 2 performed on the same day. The sessions consisting of maximal voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction and synchronous vibration sets with 1-hour rest in-between sessions 1 and 2 in healthy nulliparous women. The next intraday reliability was evaluated between the results of sessions 3 and 4 performed on the same day but followed at an interval of 4 weeks. to include the entire menstrual cycle. The interday reliability was determined based on the results of sessions 1 and 3 using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,3). The intraday ICCs for band-stop filtered mean and median sEMG frequency and mean normalized sEMG RMS amplitude of the 30Hz/2mm (ICC = 0.89–0.99) and 40Hz/4mm vibration (ICC = 0.95–0.99) indicated substantial reproducibility. The intraday reliability of high-pass filter at 100-450Hz for these parameters was also substantial (30Hz/2mm ICC of 0.92 to 0.98; 40Hz/4mm ICC of 0.88 to 0.98). The interday reliability (session 1 vs. session 3) of the mean normalized sEMG RMS amplitude for band-stop filtered means of 40 Hz/4mm and 30Hz/2mm vibration recordings was substantial (ICC = 0.82 and 0.93). However, ICCs of the mean and median frequency were indicative of fair reliability (ICC of 0.43 to 0.59). The interday reliability of mean normalized sEMG RMS amplitude for high-pass filter at 100-450Hz was substantial (30Hz/2mm ICC of 0.90; 40Hz/4mm ICC of 0.73) for the 30Hz/2mm S-WBV and moderate (ICC = 0.73) for the 40/4mm S-WBV. The ICCs for mean and median sEMG frequency ICCs indicated slight to fair reproducibility (ICC of 0.16 to 0.56). The intraday reliability of the strongest MVC contraction and average MVC turned out substantial (ICC = 0.91–0.98). The interday reliability coefficients of the strongest MVC contraction and average MVCs were 0.91 and 0.82, respectively. Concluded, the intraday reliability proved satisfactory for all variables; however, the interday comparison showed sufficient ICC levels only for the mean amplitude. We therefore recommend this parameter should be used when analyzing PFM sEMG recorded during vibration. ICCs of the mean and median frequency for both signal processing methods were indicative of insufficient reliability and did not reach the threshold for usefulness. Our study showed similar reliability of PFM sEMG during S-WBV in case of the two filtering methods used."
https://openalex.org/W3162000282,"The aim of the study was to assess the effect of different models of sucrose intake on carbohydrate-lipid metabolism and changes in oxidant balance in the ovaries and uterus of rats. Animals were divided into three groups: I-basic feed, II-feed contains 8% of sucrose, III-alternately every second week the basic feed and modified feed contains 16% of sucrose. The diet containing 8% of sucrose was found to result in an increased activity of antioxidant enzymes in the blood, with unchanged malonylodialdehyde concentration. Variable sucrose administration pattern intensified oxidative stress in the blood and led to disturbed redox equilibrium in the rat uterus, even at a comparable long-term sucrose uptake as in the group II. This was manifested as a reduced superoxide dismutase activity (in the blood and uterus) and a higher malonylodialdehyde concentration (in the uterus). The changes observed could have been a result of metabolic disorders (higher amount of visceral fat, higher glucose concentration, higher index of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and reduced HDL-cholesterol concentration) and endocrine disorders (higher oestrogen concentrations). Changes in the antioxidant status in the rats kept on the alternating diet, may underpin the failure of fertilised egg implantation in the uterine tissue and pregnancy completion."
https://openalex.org/W3163333140,"Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are migratory marine mammals that live in both open-ocean and coastal habitats. Although widely studied, little is known about their occurrence patterns in the highly urbanized estuary of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. The goal of this study was to establish the spatial and temporal distribution of bottlenose dolphins throughout this large estuarine system and use statistical modeling techniques to determine how their distribution relates to environmental factors. Three years (April-October 2017-2019) of dolphin sighting reports from a citizen-science database, Chesapeake DolphinWatch, were analyzed. The dolphins had a distinct temporal pattern, most commonly sighted during summer months, peaking in July. This pattern of observed occurrence was confirmed with systematic, passive acoustic detections of dolphin echolocation clicks from local hydrophones. Using spatially-exclusive Generalized Additive Models (GAM), dolphin presence was found to be significantly correlated to spring tidal phase, warm water temperature (24-30°C), and salinities ranging from 6-22 PPT. We were also able to use these GAMs to predict dolphin occurrence in the Bay. These predictions were statistically correlated to the actual number of dolphin sighting reported to Chesapeake DolphinWatch during that time. These models for dolphin presence can be implemented as a predictive tool for species occurrence and inform management of this protected species within the Chesapeake Bay."
https://openalex.org/W3163937484,"Background Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. The complex evolution of RSV creates a need for worldwide surveillance, which may assist in the understanding of multiple viral aspects. Objectives This study aimed to investigate RSV features under the Brazilian Influenza Surveillance Program, evaluating the role of viral load and genetic diversity in disease severity and the influence of climatic factors in viral seasonality. Methodology We have investigated the prevalence of RSV in children up to 3 years of age with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in the state of Espirito Santo (ES), Brazil, from 2016 to 2018. RT-qPCR allowed for viral detection and viral load quantification, to evaluate association with clinical features and mapping of local viral seasonality. Gene G sequencing and phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated local genetic diversity. Results Of 632 evaluated cases, 56% were caused by RSV, with both subtypes A and B co-circulating throughout the years. A discrete inverse association between average temperature and viral circulation was observed. No correlation between viral load and disease severity was observed, but children infected with RSV-A presented a higher clinical severity score (CSS), stayed longer in the hospital, and required intensive care, and ventilatory support more frequently than those infected by RSV-B. Regarding RSV diversity, some local genetic groups were observed within the main genotypes circulation RSV-A ON1 and RSV-B BA, with strains showing modifications in the G gene amino acid chain. Conclusion Local RSV studies using the Brazilian Influenza Surveillance Program are relevant as they can bring useful information to the global RSV surveillance. Understanding seasonality, virulence, and genetic diversity can aid in the development and suitability of antiviral drugs, vaccines, and assist in the administration of prophylactic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3161279389,"Previous research has shown that romantic relationships can lead to the cognitive inclusion of a romantic partner into one’s own self-representation, resulting in blurred boundaries between self and intimate other. Recent work suggests that this self-other integration process encompasses the two dimensions of the self–the conceptual and the bodily self. In line with this, it has been proposed that romantic love is associated with cognitive states that blur or reduce the saliency of self-boundaries in the bodily domain. The present study tested this hypothesis by investigating the influence of the self-other integration process in romantic love on passability judgments of door-like apertures, an action-anticipation task that rests on the representation of bodily boundaries. Romantically involved and single participants estimated whether they could pass through apertures of different widths. Moreover, inclusion of romantic partner in the self was assessed using the Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) scale. The pattern of correlation and the ratio between participants’ shoulder width and aperture judgments did not differ between romantically involved participants and singles. However, our results revealed that in romantically involved participants, the relationship between individuals’ shoulder width and aperture judgements was moderated by IOS scores. A greater inclusion of romantic partner in the self was associated with a weaker prediction of aperture judgment by participants’ shoulder width. A similar moderating effect of the intensity of romantic feelings (as measured by the passionate love scale) on shoulder width-aperture judgment relationship was found. IOS scores, but not romantic feelings, also moderated aperture judgments made for another individual (third person perspective). Together, these findings are consistent with the view that inclusion of romantic partner in the self triggers cognitive states affecting self-boundaries in the bodily domain."
https://openalex.org/W3161478112,"Writing and digital storage have largely replaced organic memory for encoding and retrieval of information in the modern era, with a corresponding decrease in emphasis on memorization in Western education. In health professional training, however, there remains a large corpus of information for which memorization is the most efficient means of ensuring: A) that the trainee has the required information readily available; and B) that a foundation of knowledge is laid, upon which the medical trainee builds multiple, complex layers of detailed information during advanced training. The carefully staged progression in early- to late- years' medical training from broad concepts (e.g. gross anatomy and pharmacology) to in-depth, specialised disciplinary knowledge (e.g. surgical interventions and follow-on care post-operatively) has clear parallels to the progression of training and knowledge exposure that Australian Aboriginal youths undergo in their progression from childhood to adulthood to Tribal Elders.As part of the Rural Health curriculum and the undergraduate Nutrition and Dietetics program in the Monash University Faculty of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences, we tested Australian Aboriginal techniques of memorization for acquisition and recall of novel word lists by first-year medical students (N = 76). We also examined undergraduate student evaluations (N = 49) of the use of the Australian Aboriginal memory technique for classroom study of foundational biomedical knowledge (the tricarboxylic acid cycle) using qualitative and quantitative analytic methods drawing from Bloom's taxonomy for orders of thinking and learning. Acquisition and recall of word lists were assessed without memory training, or after training in either the memory palace technique or the Australian Aboriginal narrative technique.Both types of memory training improved the number of correctly recalled items and reduced the frequency of specific error types relative to untrained performance. The Australian Aboriginal method resulted in approximately a 3-fold greater probability of improvement to accurate recall of the entire word list (odds ratio = 2.82; 95% c.i. = 1.15-6.90), vs. the memory palace technique (odds ratio = 2.03; 95% c.i. = 0.81-5.06) or no training (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% c.i. = 0.54-4.59) among students who did not correctly recall all list items at baseline. Student responses to learning the Australian Aboriginal memory technique in the context of biomedical science education were overwhelmingly favourable, and students found both the training and the technique enjoyable, interesting, and more useful than rote memorization. Our data indicate that this method has genuine utility and efficacy for study of biomedical sciences and in the foundation years of medical training."
https://openalex.org/W3161509050,"There are individuals who still refuse to wear seat belts, despite its effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality in road traffic accidents. We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors according to the use of seat belts among public transport drivers in Tacna, Peru.This analytical transversal study was carried out among public transport drivers (buses and taxis) in a Peruvian city. Questionnaires were used to evaluate the general and occupational characteristics and the use of seat belts (observed). Descriptive statistics and risk factors were obtained, these latter through generalized linear models.Of the 460 drivers, 77% used their seat belts, with a difference in use depending on the type of public transport (p<0.001). In the multivariate model, the risk of not using the belt was associated with the following: older age (p<0.001), having complete studies (p<0.001), a higher level/category of driving license (3 categories had p<0.001), having a higher number of previous road traffic accidents (p = 0.011), and received medical attention in that accident (p<0.001), those who reported using a cell phone while driving (p = 0.005), if the co-driver's belt had 3 anchorage points (p<0.001), and working for > 5 hours that day (p = 0.002). However, male drivers and those who had their belt with 3 anchorage points had greater use (both p<0.001).One in five drivers did not use a seat belt, and important characteristics of those who did not comply with this traffic law were evaluated to generate control and intervention measures."

https://openalex.org/W3162668034,"Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 is involved in inflammation and related tumorigenesis in the colorectum. This study aimed to investigate the chemopreventive ability of RQ-15986, a selective EP4 antagonist, in colitis-related colorectal tumorigenesis. Male Kyoto APC delta rats, which have APC mutations, were treated with azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium and subsequently administered RQ-15986 for eight weeks. At the end of the experiment, the development of colorectal tumor was significantly inhibited in the RQ-15986-treated group. The cell proliferation of the crypts and tumors in the colorectum was decreased following RQ-15986 treatment. RQ-15986 also suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-18, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, in the colon mucosa. In addition, the expression levels of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which is involved in immune tolerance, were decreased in the colorectal epithelium and tumors of the RQ-15986-treated group. These findings indicate that RQ-15986 inhibits colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis by attenuating inflammation, suppressing cell proliferation, and modulating the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Targeting prostaglandin E2/EP4 signaling might be a useful strategy for chemoprevention of inflammation-related colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3163268447,"Detecting high-collision-concentration locations based solely on collision frequency may produce different results compared to those considering the severities of the collisions. In particular, it can lead government agencies focusing sites with a high collision frequency while neglecting those with a lower collision frequency but a higher percentage of injury and fatal collisions. This study developed systematic ways of detecting reproducible fatal collision locations ( R ) using the naïve Bayes approach and a continuous risk profile (CRP) that estimates the true collision risk by filtering out random noise in the data. The posterior probability of fatal collisions being reproducible at a location is estimated by the relationship between the spatial distribution of fatal-collision locations (i.e., likelihood) and the CRP (i.e., prior probability). The proposed method can be used to detect sites with the highest proxy measure of the posterior probability (PMP) of observing R . An empirical evaluation using 5-year traffic collision data from six routes in California shows that detecting R based on the PMP outperform those based on the SPF-based approaches or random selection, regardless of various conditions and parameters of the proposed method. This method only requires traffic collision and annual traffic volume data to estimate PMP that prioritize sites being R and the PMPs can be compared across multiple routes. Therefore, it helps government agencies prioritizing sites of multiple routes where the number of fatal collisions can be reduced, thus help them to save lives with limited resources of data collection."
