https://openalex.org/W2037779370,"A photosensitive protein resembling the visual pigments of invertebrates enables phototactic archaebacteria to distinguish colour. This protein exists in two spectrally-distinct forms, one of which is a transient photoproduct of the other and each of which undergoes photochemical reactions controlling the cell's swimming behaviour. Activation of a single pigment molecule in the cell is sufficient to signal the flagellar motor. This signal-transduction mechanism makes evident a colour-sensing capability inherent in the retinal/protein chromophore."

https://openalex.org/W1483093256,"A previous analysis of covalent modification systems (Goldbeter, A., and Koshland, D. E., Jr. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 6840-6844) showed that steep transitions in the amount of modified protein can occur when the converter enzymes are saturated by their protein substrate. This ultrasensitivity can further be amplified when an effector acts at more than one step in a monocyclic or multicyclic cascade of covalent modification. We analyze the limitations of the latter multistep ultrasensitivity and show how it can combine with the zero-order effect to enhance the sensitivity of biochemical systems controlled by covalent modification."
https://openalex.org/W1583635771,"Abstract The venom of a fish-hunting cone snail (Conus geographus) contains a novel toxin, the peptide, which induces a sleep-like state in mice when injected intracerebrally. We demonstrate that this peptide contains 5 mol of gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) in 17 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the sleeper peptide is Gly-Glu-Gla-Gla-Leu-Gln-Gla-Asn-Gln-Gla-Leu-Ile-Arg-Gla-Lys-Ser-Asn-NH2."
https://openalex.org/W1489389457,"Na+-dependent GSH transport in basal-lateral membrane vesicles from rat kidney exhibited saturation kinetics while Na+-independent flux increased linearly up to 10 mM GSH. Inhibitor studies showed that GSH transport was not dependent upon the catalytic activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase. K+, choline and NH+4 ions did not stimulate GSH transport, but Li+ partially substituted for Na+. Na+-dependent GSH transport was inhibited by other gamma-glutamyl amino acids. The membrane also showed Na+-dependent transport of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and gamma-glutamylglutamate. These results show that specificity resides in the gamma-glutamyl moiety and suggest that this system may be a general transport system for gamma-glutamyl compounds. Results from four types of experiments showed that Na+-dependent GSH transport was electrogenic. Transport was stimulated by negative and inhibited by positive valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potentials; the transport rate was influenced by the anion component of the Na+ salt in the order NaSCN greater than NaCl greater than Na2SO4; analysis of the Na+ concentration dependence indicated coupling of at least 2 Na+/GSH; comparison of GSH-dependent Na+ transport and Na+-dependent GSH transport gave a Na+:GSH stoichiometry of 2:1. Thus, energy is coupled to the transport of GSH in the form of the cellular Na+ gradient and the membrane potential. This system, if it functions in vivo, can act as a mechanism for extraction of GSH from the renal circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1504501437,"Using thrombin and trypsin as probes, we determined: first, that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding determinants switch from apolipoprotein (apo) E to apo-B within the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) Sf 20-60 region of the metabolic cascade from VLDL1 (Sf 100-400) of hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) human subjects to LDL. Second, two different conformations of apo-E exist in HTG-VLDL Sf greater than 60, one accessible (greater than or equal to 1 mol/mol of particle) and one inaccessible (1-2 mol/mol) to both thrombin and the LDL receptor; normal VLDL (Sf greater than 60) have only the inaccessible conformation and therefore do not bind to the LDL receptor. Third, thrombin degrades apo-B into large fragments, three of which have electrophoretic mobilities similar to B-48, B-74, and B-26; this, however, has no effect on apo-B-mediated receptor binding. Fibroblast studies showed that thrombin could abolish receptor uptake of HTG-VLDL1 and HTG-VLDL2 (Sf 60-100), had little or no effect on HTG-VLDL3 (Sf 20-60), and no effect on uptake of intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) or LDL. Trypsin abolished the binding of HTG-VLDL1 and HTG-VLDL2, reduced that of HTG-VLDL3, but had little to no effect on IDL or LDL binding. Immunochemical techniques revealed that thrombin cleaved some apo-E into the E-22 and E-12 fragments; after trypsin treatment no apo-E was detected in any HTG-lipoprotein. Normal VLDL subclasses contained less apo-E than the corresponding HTG-VLDL subclasses and it was not cleaved by thrombin. Apo-B immunoreactivities of VLDL subclasses were not significantly changed after treatment with thrombin, although thrombin cleaved some of the B-100 of each VLDL subclass, and all apo-B in IDL and LDL, into 4-6 major large fragments. Trypsin converted all of the apo-B of each lipoprotein into smaller fragments (Mr less than 100,000). We conclude that apo-E of the thrombin-accessible conformation mediates uptake of HTG-VLDL1 and HTG-VLDL2 but that apo-B alone is sufficient to mediate receptor binding of IDL and LDL; the switch from apo-E to apo-B as the primary or sufficient binding determinant occurs within the VLDL3 (Sf 20-60) region of the metabolic cascade, where receptor binding first appears in VLDL subclasses from normal subjects."

https://openalex.org/W1583292806,"DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr = 32,000) is a cytosolic neuronal phosphoprotein enriched in dopamine-innervated brain regions which, in its phosphorylated form, acts as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. We have compared the phosphorylation of purified DARPP-32 with that of purified phosphatase inhibitor 1, a widespread inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. Purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase each catalyzed the maximal incorporation of 0.9-1.1 mol of [32P]phosphate/mol of DARPP-32 or phosphatase inhibitor 1, with phosphorylation occurring on threonine residues. Evidence for the existence of a single phosphorylation site in each substrate protein was obtained by two-dimensional thin-layer phosphopeptide mapping of thermolytic digests. Initial rate studies of the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 yielded an apparent Km of 2.4 microM and a kcat of 2.7 S-1 for the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and an apparent Km of 5.4 microM and a kcat of 2.3 S-1 for cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase. These in vitro results are compatible with a physiological role for the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by either protein kinase in vivo. Similar studies with phosphatase inhibitor 1 yielded an apparent Km of 5.0 microM and a kcat of 1.4 S-1 for the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and an apparent Km of 25.0 microM and a kcat of 1.2 S-1 for cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase. A synthetic nonapeptide, corresponding to the phosphorylation site of DARPP-32, was phosphorylated with apparent Km values of 1.12 mM and 1.86 mM and kcat values of 0.22 S-1 and 3.4 S-1 for cyclic AMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1581926266,"Human interferons induce a protein of 15,000 daltons in human and bovine cells. This protein is located in the cytoplasm in a soluble form and is induced by concentrations of interferon which induce the antiviral state. Messenger RNA prepared from interferon-treated human and bovine cells contains a mRNA which yields on translation in vitro a protein similar in size to the 15-kDa protein induced by interferon in vivo. The human protein has been purified to homogeneity from interferon-treated human cells by ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. A comparison of the peptides generated by V8 protease from the human and bovine 15-kDa proteins reveals that the two proteins are similar but not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1539422341,"We have followed the transfer of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane in cultured fibroblasts using cholesterol oxidase as a probe. Since the enzyme has access only to the plasma membrane in intact cells, it permits the discrimination of cell surface and endogenous cholesterol. Cholesterol synthesized from radiolabeled acetate was transferred to the plasma membrane in a strictly first order fashion with a half-time of 1-2 h at 37 degrees C. The rate of transfer was similar in rapidly growing and confluent cells and was not affected by preincubating the cells in lipoprotein-deficient serum which greatly stimulated cholesterol synthesis. We used equilibrium density gradient centrifugation of homogenates from cholesterol oxidase-treated cells to examine further the distribution of newly synthesized cholesterol between cellular pools. We identified membrane fractions enriched in newly synthesized cholesterol yet inaccessible to cholesterol oxidase. The cholesterol in these membranes eventually moved to the plasma membrane. The movement of exogenous radiocholesterol from the plasma membrane to the cell interior also was examined by this method. No detectable transfer was observed over several hours, during which time endogenous cholesterol moved to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the transfer of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane is a vectorial process and is not mediated by a simple diffusional equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1502817460,"Human type V collagen was purified from placenta and found to contain alpha 1(V), alpha 2(V), and alpha 3(V) chains in varying ratios. Using any of three independent nondenaturing methods (phosphocellulose chromatography, high-performance ion-exchange chromatography on IEX-540 DEAE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation), this preparation could be resolved into two fractions. Analysis of the two fractions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that one fraction contained alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V) in a 2:1 ratio and the other contained alpha 1(V), alpha 2(V), and alpha 3(V) in a 1:1:1 ratio. When the crude placental type V collagen was electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions, two bands were observed, one co-migrating with purified (alpha 1(V]2 alpha 2(V) and the other co-migrating with the fractions containing alpha 1(V), alpha 2(V), and alpha 3(V) chains in a 1:1:1 ratio. Electrophoresis in a second dimension under denaturing conditions confirmed that the fast-migrating band contained (alpha 1(V]2 alpha 2(V) and that the slow-migrating band contained the three chains in equimolar ratio. CD spectra of the two fractions and resistance to trypsin-chymotrypsin digestion confirmed that the two fractions contain triple helical collagen. Thermal denaturations were monitored by the changes in CD signal at 221 nm. The two fractions purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation melted at 39.1 and 36.4 degrees C for the (alpha 1(V]2 alpha 2(V) and alpha 1(V) alpha 2(V) alpha 3(V) fractions, respectively. Trypsin cleavage of these two native fractions at temperatures near melting produced completely different fragmentation patterns, indicating different partial unwinding sites of the alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V) chains in the two preparations and thus different molecular assemblies. Our data demonstrate the existence of two different molecular assemblies of type V collagen in human placenta consisting of (alpha 1(V]2 alpha 2(V) and alpha 1(V) alpha 2(V) alpha 3(V) heterotrimers."
https://openalex.org/W1532268646,"The adenosine analog 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibits specific in vitro transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. We report here that DRB inhibits a protein kinase present in an extract of HeLa cells and does not inhibit other protein kinases contained in the same extract. The protein kinase affected by DRB is cyclic AMP independent, prefers acidic protein substrates such as casein and phosvitin, and utilizes GTP as the phosphate donor almost as effectively as ATP in the phosphotransferase reaction. The DRB-sensitive protein kinase is also stimulated by polyamines and inhibited by quercitin and heparin. The biochemical and chromatographic properties of this enzyme correspond to those characteristic of casein kinase II. In HeLa cells, DRB is able to inhibit in vivo phosphorylation on some nuclear proteins. In HeLa cell extracts, in vitro phosphorylation of several proteins by [gamma-32P]GTP is inhibited by DRB. This protein kinase has a DRB sensitivity profile identical to the one previously reported for specific in vitro transcription by RNA polymerase II in a whole-cell extract (Zandomeni, R., Mittleman, B., Bunick, D., Ackerman, S., and Weinmann, R. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 3167-3170). Thus we suggest that this protein kinase mediates DRB inhibition of specific RNA polymerase II transcription in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1491681156,"Cultured mouse 3T3-F442A and 3T3-C2 fibroblasts exhibit a transient double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent phosphorylation of a 67,000-dalton protein (67K) without prior treatment with interferon (IFN). This phosphoprotein is similar but not identical to the dsRNA-dependent eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) alpha protein kinase (dsI), which regulates protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocytes. We have studied the relationship between cell growth and phosphorylation of the 67K protein (designated 3T3-dsRNA-dependent eIF-2 alpha kinase). A low level of dsRNA-dependent phosphorylation of 3T3-dsI was detectable in extracts prepared from cells not treated with IFN and grown at a low cell density. The phosphorylation of dsI and the phosphorylation of a 38K protein identified as the alpha-subunit (38K) of 3T3-eIF-2 (eIF-2 alpha) occurred concomitantly; the levels of these phosphorylations confluent and thereafter decreased markedly. Treatment of cells with IFN at all stages of growth resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of dsI. 3T3-F442A and 3T3-C2 fibroblasts were found to produce and secrete IFN at levels sufficient to induce an elevated dsI activity."
https://openalex.org/W1936735623,"DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr = 32,000) is a major endogenous cytosolic substrate for dopamine- and cyclic AMP-stimulated protein phosphorylation in neurons of the basal ganglia of mammalian brain. It shares many properties with phosphatase inhibitor 1, a substrate for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and with G-substrate, a substrate for cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase. We have, therefore, undertaken an analysis of the amino acid sequence around the site at which purified DARPP-32 is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The results indicate that DARPP-32 is phosphorylated at a single threonine residue contained in the sequence Arg-Arg-Arg-Pro-Thr(P)-Pro-Ala-Met-Leu-Phe-Arg. This sequence was obtained by automated solid phase sequencing of two overlapping tryptic phosphopeptides and one overlapping chymotryptic phosphopeptide which were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. A 9-amino acid sequence containing the phosphorylatable threonine residue in DARPP-32 shares 8 identical residues with a sequence containing the phosphorylatable threonine residue in phosphatase inhibitor 1, and shares 5 identical residues with the two identical sequences surrounding the 2 phosphorylatable threonine residues in G-substrate. These observations support the view that DARPP-32, inhibitor 1, and G-substrate are members of a family of regulatory proteins which are involved in the control of protein phosphatase activity by both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, but which differ in their cellular and tissue distributions."
https://openalex.org/W1576878402,"[3-14C]Acetoacetate, injected subcutaneously into rats, was rapidly incorporated into hepatic cholesterol and fatty acids. Injection of radiolabeled acetoacetate, acetate, or glucose resulted in the preferential incorporation of acetoacetate into cholesterol. The postmitochondrial supernatant of a rat liver homogenate has the capacity to synthesize radiolabeled sterols from [3-14C]acetoacetate, and this capacity surpasses its capacity to utilize [1-14C]acetate. The activity of acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, a cytoplasmic enzyme that activates acetoacetate, was found to be highly regulated by modulators known to affect the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and/or cholesterol biosynthesis in liver and adrenals of adult rats. Acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase activity was depressed by feeding cholesterol or mevalonate administration and was enhanced by the addition to the diet of mevinolin and/or cholestyramine. The activity of acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase in adrenals was enhanced by treatment of the animals with 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine. These changes in activity of acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase were in synchrony with changes in the activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. The evidence suggests that the regulation of acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase activity and the utilization of acetoacetate for lipogenesis is closely linked to the regulation of cholesterogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1529649026,"The anaerobic proteins of maize are a set of 10 major and 10 minor polypeptides selectively synthesized in anaerobic seedling roots. 1) Anaerobiosis resulted in the selected labeling of a protein which bound to Blue Sepharose and was eluted by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. 2) This protein elicited antiserum which recognized a single protein with molecular weight of approximately 40,000. 3) By Western blot analysis, this antiserum recognized a maize fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase purified to homogeneity. We show that two major anaerobic proteins of maize, ANP35.5 and ANP33A, correspond to a cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase."
https://openalex.org/W1494862138,"Salt induces aggregation of large chromatin fragments maximally at 150-200 mM NaCl. The soluble fragments are depleted of H1 histones while the aggregated fragments are enriched. H1 histones did not equilibrate between the soluble and insoluble chromatin fractions when they were recycled through the process of salt-induced aggregation. The chromatin fragments that resisted aggregation retained more H1c subtype than they did H1 ab, correlating with previous results which showed complexes of H1c with DNA resisted salt-induced aggregation much more than complexes of DNA with other subtypes. The chromatin that was soluble at physiological concentrations of NaCl was DNase I sensitive and enriched in acetylated core histones. We conclude that H1 histone is nonuniformly distributed in chromatin in a stable pattern that probably correlates with the different degrees of condensation known to exist in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1500095501,"We have investigated the interaction of several charged amphiphiles with the Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism in a highly purified preparation of canine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. In all cases, the hydrophobic part of the molecule was an unbranched alkyl group. All anionic lauryl derivatives stimulated (by up to 100%) the initial rate of Na+-Ca2+ exchange in the order lauryl sulfate greater than dodecyl sulfonate greater than lauric acid. All cationic lauryl derivatives (dodecylamine, dodecyltrimethylamine, laurylcholine) were potent inhibitors of Na+-Ca2+ exchange (approximately 50% at 20 microM amphiphile). The effects of the charged amphiphiles on Na+-Ca2+ exchange were not secondary to altered passive ion permeabilities or to altered membrane surface potential. The anionic compound lauryl sulfate stimulated sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity by increasing the apparent affinity of the exchanger for Ca2+. In contrast, cationic dodecylamine did not change the apparent Km (Ca2+) and acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor of Na+-Ca2+ exchange. The effectiveness of the amphiphiles could be varied by altering the length of the alkyl chain. The more hydrophobic the molecule (i.e. the longer the alkyl chain), the more potent was the stimulation or inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange. This implies that the amphiphiles most probably become embedded in the membrane lipid bilayer to exert effects on Na+-Ca2+ exchange. The Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism is more sensitive to the charged amphiphiles than are other sarcolemmal transport mechanisms. We have previously suggested (Philipson, K. D., and Nishimoto, A. Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 16-19) that negatively charged phospholipids could stimulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. We propose that the charged amphiphiles modulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity by acting as phospholipid analogues. The amphiphiles are useful tools for studying the interaction of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism with the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1536035569,"Pure phenylalanine hydroxylase from rat liver can be activated by limited proteolysis with alpha-chymotrypsin. As with most other types of activation of this enzyme, including activation by exposure to lysolecithin, the increase in activity is expressed in the presence of the naturally occurring pterin cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, but not in the presence of synthetic pterin cofactors such as 6-methyltetrahydropterin. With the chymotrypsin-activated enzyme, we have demonstrated directly, using circular dichroism measurements, that the activated enzyme differs in conformation from the native enzyme. In addition to chymotrypsin, trypsin and a mixture of rat liver lysosomal proteases can also activate phenylalanine hydroxylase. The latter finding raises the possibility that activation of the enzyme by limited proteolysis may be a physiologically important process. In experiments carried out with phenylalanine in which all five hydrogens on the aromatic ring have been replaced with deuterium, and in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, we have been unable to detect a kinetic isotope effect with either the native hydroxylase or with the hydroxylase activated by limited proteolysis, or by exposure to lysolecithin. By contrast, with both native and activated enzymes, a small isotope effect was detected when 6-methyltetrahydropterin was used as the pterin cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W1589803734,"A Na+ gradient (extravesicular greater than intravesicular) increased the rate of inorganic sulfate (SO24-) uptake into renal brush-border membrane vesicles and energized the transient accumulation of the anion against its concentration gradient, indicating a secondary active transport system. Stimulation of SO24- uptake was specific for Na+. The anions, SO23-, S2O23-, SeO24-, MoO24-, CrO24-, and WO24-, but not HPO24-, cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated SO24- uptake, suggesting that these divalent anions shared the SO24- carrier. The Na+/SO24- co-transport and Na+. The apparent Km for SO24- was 0.6 mM at 100 mM Na+. The relationship between Na+ concentration and rate of SO24- uptake was sigmoidal. From a Hill analysis of the data a [Na+]0.5 of 36 mM and an n value of 1.6 were calculated. Comparisons of the effects of a K+ diffusion potential (inside positive), of a H+ diffusion potential (inside negative), of Na+ salts of anions of different conductances on the Na+-dependent uptakes of SO24- and D-glucose, and of the responses of a membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent probe concomitant with the uptakes indicate that Na+/SO24- co-transport was electroneutral. The simplest stoichiometry consistent with an electroneutral mechanism would be the co-transport of two Na+ and one SO24-. Na+ gradient-dependent SO24- uptake was enhanced by intravesicular Cl-. cis-Cl- inhibited the efflux as well as the influx of SO24-. These findings suggest that Cl- was an inhibitor of SO24- transport. Intravesicular K+ stimulated Na+ gradient-dependent SO24- uptake. The co-transport of Na+/SO24- appeared not to be coupled to the transmembrane flux of K+. It is hypothesized that the co-transport system contained an internal site activated by K+."
https://openalex.org/W1486801948,"Mutant promastigotes of Leishmania donovani deficient in adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (AP-Rib transferase) have been isolated in medium containing 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine. The generation of AP-Rib transferase-deficient mutants occurred in two discrete steps. In the first step, clones were isolated with 50% of wild-type levels of AP-Rib transferase activity. These cells were reselected, and colonies totally deficient in AP-Rib transferase were isolated. Wild-type and AP-Rib transferase-deficient cells contained equivalent amounts of other enzymes essential to adenine metabolism such as adenine deaminase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Partially and totally AP-Rib transferase-deficient cells exhibited intermediate and complete resistance to cytotoxic adenine analogs, respectively. Nevertheless, wild-type and mutant cells could salvage adenine and utilize adenine as a purine source equally efficiently, suggesting that the adenine deaminase-hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase pathway plays an important role in promastigote adenine metabolism. Kinetic and thermal inactivation studies of purified AP-Rib transferase and isoelectric focusing of crude extracts from wild-type and partially AP-Rib transferase-deficient cells suggested that the latter cells possessed wild-type AP-Rib transferase activity at half the amount found in wild-type parental cells. These data suggest that L. donovani possesses two copies of the AP-Rib transferase structural gene and that these organisms might be diploid for the AP-Rib transferase locus."

https://openalex.org/W1523797526,"The preparation of a pure, monoiodinated derivative of mast cell-degranulating peptide (MCD peptide), the mast cell-degranulating peptide from bee venom, has enabled us to identify binding sites in rat brain membranes that have a high affinity and specificity for this peptide. These binding sites are evenly distributed throughout the brain and copurify with synaptic membranes. Saturation-binding curves, determined by rapid centrifugation or filtration assays, indicate a single population of sites with a concentration of 200 fmol/mg membrane protein in partially fractionated, lysed brain membranes. Dissociation constants of 150 and 140 pM were calculated for the iodinated and native peptides, respectively. These binding sites are probably associated with the neurotoxic action of MCD peptide in the central nervous system. No similar binding sites have been identified in peripheral tissue preparations, and other polycationic mast cell-degranulating agents including compound 48/80 show no such specificity. Specific modification of the primary amines, arginine residues, or disulfide bridges of MCD peptide results in a complete loss of binding activity. Other components of bee venom show specificity for the MCD peptide-binding site, suggesting that a class of neurotoxins in bee venom (possibly including secapin and tertiapin, but not apamin) share the specific action of MCD peptide on the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2042091378,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the causative agent of crown gall, a plant tumour that can arise on most species of dicotyledonous plants. The tumour-inducing capacity of the bacterium requires the presence of a large plasmid, designated the Ti plasmid1,2, which itself contains two regions essential for tumour formation—the T(umour)-region and the Vir(ulence)-region3. The T-region is transferred to plant cells by an unknown mechanism, and becomes stably integrated into the plant genome4–9. The Vir-region has been identified by transposon mutagenesis10–16, but the DNA of this region has never been detected in tumour lines4,5. However, trans-complementation of Vir mutants17 indicates that genes of the Vir-region are functional in the bacterium. Moreover, the Vir-and T-regions can be physically separated in A. tumefaciens without loss of tumour-inducing capacity18,19. Seven loci, designated virA–F and virO (refs 17, 20–22), have been identified in the Vir-region of the octopine Ti plasmid, but their functions are unknown. As virC mutants in the octopine-type plasmid pTiB6 are invariably avirulent in tests on various plant species17, this gene seems to be essential for virulence and we are studying it in detail. We report here that the promoter of virC shows no detectable activity in A. tumefaciens and Escherichia coli K-12 grown in standard medium, but that its activity is induced by a plant product."
https://openalex.org/W1511409746,"Transfer of an aqueous-soluble peptide hormone or neurotransmitter such as [Met]- or [Leu]enkephalin (Tyr1-Gly2-Gly3-Phe4-Met5(Leu5)), to the lipid-rich environment of its membrane-embedded receptor protein may convert the peptide into a (bioactive) conformation required for eliciting biological activity. We have examined by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy the conformational parameters of free enkephalin in aqueous solution versus those of enkephalin bound to lysophosphatidylcholine micelles using two approaches: 1) exchange rates, line broadening, coupling constants, and chemical shift changes of enkephalin backbone peptide N-H protons were measured for free and membrane-bound peptide in H2O (360 MHz, pH 5.6, 20 degrees C). A selective upfield shift observed for the Met5(Leu5) N-H proton upon lipid binding was interpreted in terms of its incorporation into an intramolecular H-bond. 2) 13C chemical shift changes induced by the shift reagent praseodymium nitrate (Pr(NO3)3) were compared in the presence and absence of lipid micelles. Significant changes occurring in Gly2 carbon atoms in membrane-bound enkephalin suggested the relative proximity of this residue to the Pr3+ atom (bound to the Met5(Leu5) COOH-terminal carboxylate 4 residues away). These combined results, in conjunction with studies on the specific interactions of enkephalin substituents with the micelles (Deber, C. M., and Behnam, B. A., (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 61-65) suggest that enkephalin folds into an intramolecularly H-bonded beta-turn structure (with an H-bond between Gly2 C = O and Met5 NH) in the lipid environment. Such folding could facilitate the positioning of strategic residues in vivo as the hormone diffuses toward its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1535534314,"We investigated by means of an automated ellipsometer the calcium-dependent binding of prothrombin from a buffer solution to monolayers of dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) deposited on chromium slides. This technique allows direct measurements of bound and free protein concentrations and is not hampered by calcium-induced aggregation of vesicles. For pure DOPS a dominant class of binding sites exists with a dissociation constant, Kd = (6 +/- 2) X 10(-10) M (mean +/- S.D.) and maximal binding of prothrombin, gamma max = 0.26 +/- 0.03 micrograms/cm2. Incorporation of a small fraction of DOPC in the monolayer causes a large decrease in the binding affinity with a pronounced biphasic behavior of the binding curve. For monolayers consisting of 20% DOPS and 80% DOPC the binding curve becomes monophasic with Kd = (1.6 +/- 0.6) X 10(-7) M and gamma max = 0.22 +/- 0.03 micrograms/cm2. The procoagulant activity of the monolayers was tested by measuring the generation of thrombin after addition of prothrombin and activated coagulation factors X and V. The thrombin-generating capacity of monolayers and single-bilayer vesicles is comparable but is apparently diffusion limited in the monolayer system. The calcium-dependent formation of stacked multilayers according to the Blodgett technique appeared to be strongly influenced by the DOPS/DOPC ratio in the phospholipid monolayer. From these results it is concluded that for pure DOPS monolayers high-affinity prothrombin-phospholipid and phospholipid-phospholipid interactions exist which are radically disturbed when the monolayer contains more than 20-30% of DOPC."
https://openalex.org/W1680243606,"Tropomyosin preparations from human platelets, human peripheral blood leukocytes from normal individuals and from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, human lymphoblastoid cells (GM607), human epithelial cells, and human skin fibroblasts have all been found to contain more than one protein when analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Although the lymphoid cell preparations consistently contain two proteins of almost identical molecular weight (Mr = 30,000), the platelet, epithelial cell, and fibroblast preparations contain two or more major proteins with molecular weights between 31,000 and 36,000, in addition to a major protein at 30,000. All of these proteins have characteristics in common with tropomyosin including slightly acidic isoelectric point (approximately pH 4), stability to heat and organic solvents, association with the cytoskeleton, and reactivity with antibody against skeletal muscle tropomyosin. The nonmuscle tropomyosin-like proteins were compared with tropomysins from human skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle by peptide mapping after partial proteolysis. The results showed one of the non-muscle proteins to be identical to the major smooth muscle tropomyosin in human uterus (myometrium) and another to be similar but not identical to skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin. The remainder of the proteins with tropomyosin characteristics was unique to non-muscle cells. In all, nine distinct human proteins with characteristics of tropomyosin are described. Charge variants of two of these proteins have been described previously."
https://openalex.org/W1503270919,"The nucleotide sequence of the gene for the adenovirus type 2 hexon has been determined. The hexon polypeptide consists of 967 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 109,058. Several tentative parts in the previously reported amino acid sequence were resolved from the DNA sequence. The existence of regions with unusual properties in the hexon protein was confirmed, including a region consisting of 16 consecutive acidic residues in the N-terminal part of the protein. In conjunction with previously published sequences and sequences reported in the accompanying papers (Alestrom, P., Akusjarvi, G., Lager, M., Yeh-Kai, L., and Petterson, U. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13980-13985; Roberts, R. J., O'Neill, K. E., and Yen, C. E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13965-13975) a complete sequence of the 35,937-base pairs-long adenovirus type 2 genome can now be reconstructed."
https://openalex.org/W1561999405,"The interaction of the camphor hydroxylating P-450 isolated from Pseudomonas putida grown on camphor (P-450-CAM) with 5,5-difluorocamphor, a substrate analog in which the two methylene hydrogens at the normal site of hydroxylation have been replaced with fluorine, has been examined. This compound binds tightly to the enzyme with a dissociation constant and UV-visible absorption spectrum identical to that observed with d-camphor. In the presence of the reconstituted P-450-CAM system, 5,5-difluorocamphor is metabolized at a rate approximately one-third the rate of the physiological substrate, d-camphor, resulting in the formation of a hydroxylated product with a molecular weight of 204 as well as a minor (less than 3%) hydroxylated product of molecular weight 184. Isotopically labeled molecular oxygen (18O2) is incorporated into the major product while labeled oxygen from water (H218O) is not incorporated, clearly indicating that the hydroxyl oxygen originates from dioxygen. Proton NMR characterization (400 MHz) of the major product has led to its assignment as 5,5-difluoro-9-hydroxy-camphor, with supporting structural evidence provided by the mass spectral fragmentation pattern. The formation of 9-hydroxylated product represents the first example of methyl hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P-450-CAM, indicates a change in regio-selectivity when the normal site of reaction is blocked, and supports the hypothesis that the delivery of the oxygen atom occurs from the exo side of the camphor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1498124367,"We have isolated and characterised A-IV apolipoprotein (apo-A-IV) from human lymph and plasma by immunoabsorbance chromatography and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Two different apo-A-IV-containing lipoproteins were isolated from four different sources, human lymph triglyceride-rich fraction (TRL), lymph lipoprotein-deficient fraction (LDF), plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and plasma lipoprotein-deficient fraction (LDF). The lipoprotein complexes obtained from lymph TRL and plasma HDL were similar and contained apo-A-IV, apo-A-I, and small molecular weight peptides (apo-C or -A-II). The second lipoprotein complex was isolated from lymph LDF and plasma LDF, and contained apo-A-IV, apo-A-I, and a peptide of Mr = 59,000. The lipid composition of the lipoprotein complexes varied according to the source: triglyceride predominating in lymph TRL and phospholipid and cholesteryl ester from the other sources. Free cholesterol was conspicuously present in very small amounts. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting techniques, eleven isoproteins of apo-A-IV were identified (pI-4.98, 5.06, 5.10, 5.15, 5.20, 5.22, 5.25, 5.30, 5.34, 5.42, and 5.48). The isoprotein pattern of lymph TRL and plasma HDL was similar, but that of lymph and plasma LDF were different patterns. These results suggest that apo-A-IV associated with d less than 1.21 lipoproteins and apo-A-IV present in LDF may be in metabolically separate lipoproteins and may have different physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W1571303406,"The interactions of smooth muscle myosin and its light chains have been examined by incubating sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of myosin with radioactively labeled regulatory or essential light chains. The technique involves sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fixation with methanol and acetic acid followed by an extensive series of washes. The gel is incubated overnight with labeled light chains in the presence of bovine serum albumin and then washed extensively to remove unbound protein. Following staining and destaining, the gel is autoradiographed to reveal which protein bands have bound light chain. The myosin heavy chain was able to rebind labeled regulatory or essential light chains despite the harsh procedure described above. By fragmenting the myosin heavy chain proteolytically, we were able to determine the binding site for both types of light chains to be within the 26,000-Da COOH-terminal segment of smooth muscle subfragment 1 (S-1) or the 20,000-Da COOH-terminal segment of skeletal muscle S-1. The extent of binding was 0.1-0.4 mol of light chain/mol of S-1 heavy chain. No binding was observed to portions of the myosin molecule which do not contain this segment such as myosin rod, light meromyosin, S-2, or the NH2-terminal 75,000-Da segment of S-1."
https://openalex.org/W1564702795,"The time dependence of the molecular weight, radius of gyration, and hydrodynamic size distribution for porcine submaxillary mucin (PSM) in solution have been studied using static and dynamic light scattering. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of PSM in 6 M guanidine HCl, pH 7, is initially 3 X 10(6) and decreases with time in three phases: rapidly from 3-2 X 10(6), less rapidly from 2-0.9 X 10(6), and slowly below 0.9 X 10(6). The rates of decrease are much greater at pH 2. The energy of activation associated with each phase is 20 kcal/mol, which is similar to that reported for peptide bond cleavage at an aspartic acid residue. Addition of mercaptoethanol to PSM in 6 M guanidine HCl leads to a rapid decrease in Mw to 0.9 X 10(6), followed by a very slow further decrease. These results suggest that native PSM consists of subunits (Mw = 0.9 X 10(6] that are linked by disulfide bonds to form dimers (Mw = 2 X 10(6] and then higher aggregates. This cross-linking appears to occur at unglycosylated regions of the protein core, which are believed to be richer in aspartic acid than the rest of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1589960552,"Primary monolayer cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes were employed in pulse-chase experiments to examine plasma protein synthesis and secretion. The fates of [35S]methionine-labeled fibrinogen and transferrin were monitored in cell extracts and in spent culture media. It was found that hepatocytes, which were maintained in the absence of added hormones or serum, released into the medium virtually all of the label of transferrin but only 30% of the label in fibrinogen. The remainder of the labeled fibrinogen was retained by the cells, gradually disappearing in a manner suggestive of its intracellular degradation. To stimulate fibrinogen production on as many levels as possible, fetal bovine serum was added to the medium of the cultured cells. Serum elicited an increase in the level of fibrinogen mRNA which was accompanied by a 7-fold increase in the rate of fibrinogen synthesis as well as the complete release of fibrinogen label, resulting in an overall 20-fold enhancement in the hepatocellular output of this protein. Thus, both the amount of fibrinogen synthesized as well as the amount ultimately secreted are subject to modulation by the hepatocellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1486491020,"Isolated 3H-labeled human hemoglobin alpha chains were incubated with unlabeled carbonmonoxyhemoglobin A for 72 h in 0.01 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 25 degrees C. Following separation of the free alpha chain monomers and Hb A (alpha 2 beta 2) tetramers by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips or by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose columns, analysis of radioactivity showed a slow transfer of 3H-labeled alpha chains into Hb A. Separation of the globin chains of the isolated [3H] Hb A on a CM-cellulose column in 8 M urea showed that the radioactivity was in structurally intact alpha chains. Gel filtration of a reaction mixture on Sephadex G-75 in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl showed that the 3H-labeled alpha-chains in Hb A were an integral part of, and not nonspecifically adsorbed to, the tetramer. These results indicate that the free 3H-labeled alpha chain monomers were incorporated into Hb A by exchange with pre-existing unlabeled alpha chain subunits according to the scheme, alpha 2 beta 2 in equilibrium 2 alpha beta in equilibrium 2 alpha + 2 beta. The rate constant for the dissociation of alpha beta dimers to alpha and beta monomers, the rate-limiting step in this exchange reaction, was 4.0 (+/- 0.7) X 10(-3) h-1."
https://openalex.org/W1538199178,"The 130- and 125-kDa heavy chains of Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB were radioactively labeled at either the regulatory phosphorylation site or the catalytic site and then subjected to controlled proteolysis by either trypsin or chymotrypsin. The labeled and unlabeled peptides generated during the course of proteolysis were identified by autoradiography and Coomassie Blue staining after separation by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The relative positions of the phosphorylation and active sites could be deduced. The catalytic site of myosin IA is most probably within 38 kDa of one end of the 130-kDa heavy chain, and the phosphorylation site, which can be no more than 40 kDa away from the catalytic site, would then be between 38 and 78 kDa of that same end of the heavy chain. Possibly, the phosphorylation site is further restricted to the region between 38 and 64 kDa from the end of the heavy chain. The catalytic and phosphorylation sites of myosin IB are both contained within a segment of 62 kDa at one end of the 125-kDa heavy chain and are within 40 kDa of each other. The phosphorylation site may be restricted to a small segment between 60 and 62 kDa from one end of the heavy chain which would limit the possible position of the catalytic site to the region between 20 and 60 kDa of that end."
https://openalex.org/W1552185284,"NADH and NAD+ are neither substrates nor inhibitors of 3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in concentrations up to 1 mM. Addition of either NADH or NAD+ enhanced the activity of rat liver microsomal reductase, yet NADH failed to affect the activity of the freeze-thaw solubilized enzyme. The degree of enhancement of enzyme activity by NADH decreased as GSH concentration in the assay increased. Addition of 500 microM NADH to the assay converted the sigmoidal (Hill coefficient = 2.0) NADPH-dependent kinetic curve of the microsomal reductase into Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Hill coefficient = 1.1). Furthermore, the kinetic curves were shifted to the left, resulting in an up to 35% decrease in the concentration of NADH required to obtain half-maximal velocity (S0.5) in the presence of 500 microM NADH. Again, this effect of NADH was diminished as GSH concentrations increased. These results demonstrate that NAD(H) is an allosteric activator of HMG-CoA reductase. These results also indicate that HMG-CoA reductase has NAD(H) binding site(s) distinct from the catalytic NADPH site(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1499898359,"An electron density map of trimethylamine dehydrogenase has been calculated at 6.0-A resolution. Protein phases were based on two isomorphous mercury derivatives with similar binding properties, and on anomalous scattering measurements. The map has been averaged about the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis, plotted on transparent sheets and used to construct a wooden model. The elipsoidal dimer has a large inter-subunit interface. Each subunit appears to contain three closely associated domains with the iron-sulfur cluster located between two of them. The map suggests an alpha/beta-structure for two of the domains and a large helix content for the third."
https://openalex.org/W1536971633,"It has been proposed that the sequences surrounding nonsense codons determine the efficiency of protein-chain termination. To test this hypothesis, the termination factor, RF-1, was purified to near homogeneity and was used to examine the specificity of in vitro prokaryotic termination as a function of the nature and number of bases adjacent to UAA. Oligomers with different nucleotide sequences surrounding UAA were synthesized and their conformation was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The activity of these oligomers in RF-1-dependent termination was assayed by the release of analogues of peptides, N-acetyl or N-formyl-methionine, that were bound to ribosomes as N-acetyl or N-formyl-Met-tRNAfMet with either AUG or AUG covalently linked to another oligoribonucleotide. In the former case, a second oligomer was added to stimulate release. When added to the AUG-bound intermediate, UAAUAA was 5-fold less effective in stimulating release of N-acetyl-Met by RF-1 than were UAA, UAAN (where N is any base), UAAUGA, or UAAUAG. Oligomers AUGUAA, AUGUUAA, and AUG(U)mUAA18-25 (where m = 1-5) stimulated release by RF-1, whereas AUGCUA, AUGCUAA, and other control polymers were inactive. The data suggest that recognition of UAA depends, at least in part, on the nature of the bases surrounding UAA. A loosely stacked conformation of UAA in the short messengers favors termination, whereas nucleosides which encourage strong base stacking restrict release."
https://openalex.org/W1596476375,"Resonance Raman spectroscopic data provide conclusive evidence for the existence of an acyl-enzyme intermediate during the reaction of a thionoester substrate, N-methyloxycarbonylphenylalanylglycine methyl thionoester (CH3OC(=O)-Phe-NHCH2C(=S) OCH3), with cathepsin B from porcine spleen. The resonance Raman spectrum of CH3OC(=O)-Phe-NHCH2C(=S)S-cathepsin B, where the thiol S is from the active-site cysteine residue, is compared to that of the corresponding papain acyl-enzyme. Within the limits of experimental error (+/-2 cm-1 for peak positions), there are no detectable spectral differences. Since the resonance Raman spectrum is sensitive to the torsional angles in the glycinic bonds and the cysteine linkages, the conformations are identical in those parts of the acyl-enzymes where chemical transformation occurs. A conformational analysis of the model compound CH3OC(=O)-Phe-NHCH2C(=S)SC2H5 demonstrates that the dithioacyl group in both dithioacyl-enzymes is present as a single population of a form known as conformer B. Conformer B is characterized by a small torsional angle about the glycinic NHCH2-CS(thiol) bond such that the nitrogen and S (thiol) atoms are in close contact. This conformer is widespread among the dithioacyl intermediates of plant cysteine proteinases, and it is apparent that the same chemistry is retained in a mammalian cysteine proteinase. Steady-state kinetic parameters are also reported for CH3OC(=O)-Phe-NHCH2C(=S)OCH3 reacting with papain and cathepsin B. The similarity of the Kcat values, 0.53 and 1.15 s-1, for papain and cathepsin B, respectively, provides further evidence for a conserved deacylation process."
https://openalex.org/W1542357258,"Bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)fumarate (I) reacts preferentially with oxyhemoglobin to cross-link the two beta 82 lysine residues within the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) binding site and as a result markedly increases the solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S. The cross-link acts by perturbing the acceptor site for Val 6 within the sickle cell fiber (Chatterjee, R., Walder, R. Y., Arnone, A., and Walder, J. A. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 5901-5909). In the present studies we have compared a large number of analogs of I to determine the structural features of the reagent required for specificity and for transport into the red cell. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute to the binding of these compounds at the DPG site. The optimal position for the negatively charged groups on the cross-linking agent for productive binding is adjacent to the ester as in the original salicylic acid derivatives. There is a direct correlation between the reactivity toward hemoglobin and the hydrophobicity of the substituent attached at the para position. Phenyl and substituted phenyl derivatives as in the analgesic, antiinflammatory drug diflunisal are particularly effective. These groups probably interact with hydrophobic residues of the amino-terminal tripeptide and the EF corner of the beta chains adjacent to the DPG binding site. Although bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)fumarate is very reactive toward hemoglobin in solution, it is much less effective in modifying hemoglobin within the red cell. The reaction with intracellular hemoglobin was shown to be limited by competing hydrolysis of the reagent catalyzed at the outer surface of the erythrocyte membrane. Inactivation of the red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not inhibit this reaction. Introduction of a single methyl group onto the carbon-carbon double bond of the fumaryl moiety decreases the lability of the ester 10-fold, due to steric effects, and allows the reagent to be taken up by the red cell and modify intracellular hemoglobin. The kinetics of transport of the methylfumarate derivative, bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)mesaconate, are first-order, consistent with passive diffusion. The attachment of larger alkyl groups onto the cross-link bridge further enhances the transport of the reagent into the red cell. The solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S cross-linked with the butylfumarate derivative was found to be increased by almost 10% compared to the original fumarate diester.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
