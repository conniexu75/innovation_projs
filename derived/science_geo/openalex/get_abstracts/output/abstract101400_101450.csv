Insulin increased PHAS-I protein (3.3-fold after 2 days), the rate of PHAS-I synthesis (3-fold after 1 h), and the half-life of the protein (from 1.5 to 2.5 days). Insulin also increased the phosphorylation of PHAS-I and promoted dissociation of the PHAS-I•eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF-4E) complex, effects that were maximal within 10 min. With recombinant [H6]PHAS-I as substrate, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was the only insulin-stimulated PHAS-I kinase detected after fractionation of extracts by Mono Q chromatography; however, MAP kinase did not readily phosphorylate [H6]PHAS-I when the [H6]PHAS-I•eIF-4E complex was the substrate. Thus, while MAP kinase may phosphorylate free PHAS-I, it is not sufficient to dissociate the complex. Moreover, rapamycin attenuated the stimulation of PHAS-I phosphorylation by insulin and markedly inhibited dissociation of PHAS-I•eIF-4E, without decreasing MAP kinase activity. Rapamycin abolished the effects of insulin on increasing phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and on activating p70S6K. The MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, PD 098059, markedly decreased MAP kinase activation by insulin, but it did not change PHAS-I phosphorylation or the association of PHAS-I with eIF-4E. In summary, insulin increases the expression of PHAS-I and promotes phosphorylation of multiple sites in the protein via multiple transduction pathways, one of which is rapamycin-sensitive and independent of MAP kinase. Rapamycin may inhibit translation initiation by increasing PHAS-I binding to eIF-4E.

https://openalex.org/W1995678491,"The precursor of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (proMMP-9, progelatinase B) noncovalently binds to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 through the C-terminal domain of each molecule. We have isolated the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex from the medium of human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells and investigated the activation processes of the complex by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, trypsin, and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3, stromelysin 1). The treatment of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate or trypsin converts proMMP-9 to lower molecular weight species corresponding to active forms, but no gelatinolytic activity is detected. The lack of enzymic activity results from binding of TIMP-1 to the activated MMP-9. The treatment of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex with a possible physiological proMMP-9 activator, MMP-3, does not reveal any gelatinolytic activity unless the molar ratio of MMP-3 to the complex exceeds 1. This is due to the inhibition of MMP-3 by TIMP-1 forming a ternary proMMP-9•TIMP-1•MMP-3 complex. The formation of the ternary complex weakens the interaction between proMMP-9 and TIMP-1, resulting in partial dissociation of the complex into proMMP-9 and the TIMP-1•MMP-3 complex. When MMP-3 is in excess, the propeptide is completely processed, and the full activity of MMP-9 is detected. Similarly, the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex inhibits MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) and in turn renders the proMMP-9 activable by a catalytic amount of MMP-3. These results suggest that formation of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex regulates extracellular matrix breakdown in tissue by switching the predominant MMP activity from one type to another.

Activities of the MMPs are precisely controlled, not only by their gene expression in various cell types but also by activation of their precursors (proMMPs) and inhibition by endogenous inhibitors, such as α2-macroglobulin (α2M) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)(1Woessner Jr., J.F.

Among them, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are unique in that their zymogen forms can form a complex with TIMP-2 and TIMP-1, respectively(9Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. J. Biol.

The progelatinase-TIMP complexes are formed through the interaction of the C-terminal hemopexin/vitronectin-like domain of the zymogen and the C-terminal domain of the inhibitor(16Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

This introduces complexity in activation of progelatinase-TIMP complexes. proMMP-2 free of TIMP-2 can be readily activated by a mercurial compound, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA)(25Okada Y.

Biochem. 1990; 194: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and by a specific cell surface activator expressed in fibroblasts and cancer cells treated with concanavalin A or a phorbol ester(26Overall C.M.

Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar); however, the activation of proMMP-2 by a cell surface activator is prevented in the presence of TIMP-2(28Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Golberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex is also resistant to activation by MMP-3(21Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4519-4583Google Scholar), while proMMP-9 free of TIMP-1 is readily activated by MMP-3 (21Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4519-4583Google Scholar, 30Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem.

On the other hand, many investigators reported that treatment of the proMMP-2•TIMP-2 complex or the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex with APMA yielded gelatinolytic activity with concomitant conversion of the proenzyme to active forms, although the specific activities of the activated complexes were considerably lower than those of TIMP-free gelatinases(11Goldberg G.I.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13064-13069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, our studies on the activation of the proMMP-2•TIMP-2 complex by APMA have indicated that the activated proMMP-2 is inhibited by the TIMP-2 before it loses the propeptide by autocatalysis(24Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To attain the enzymic activity, masking of the N-terminal inhibitory domain of TIMP-2 with another active MMP is prerequisite(24Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).In this report, we have isolated the human proMMP-9•TIMP-1 and investigated the molecular rearrangements that occur in the complex upon activation with APMA and trypsin. To address a possible biological implication of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex formation to extracellular matrix catabolism, we have also investigated the conditions that are required for the activation of the complex by MMP-3, a likely proMMP-9 activator in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAPMA, Brij 35, diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), trypsin (bovine), plasminogen (human), urokinase, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-(sheep IgG) IgG were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI 1640 medium, antibiotics, fetal calf serum, and lactalbumin hydrolysate were from Life Technologies, Inc. Gelatin-Sepharose 4B, Sephacryl S-200, and S-300 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. DE-52 (DEAE-cellulose) was from Whatman. Green A Matrex gel and YM-10 membrane were from Amicon Corp. Affi-Gel 10 was from Bio-Rad. Human α2M was a gift from Dr. Jan J. Enghild, Duke University Medical Center. Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 cell was obtained from American Type Culture Collection.Cell CulturesHT-1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. After confluency, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and treated with TPA (20 ng/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate for 2 days. The conditioned medium was harvested and used for purification of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex.Anti-(human TIMP-1) IgG-SepharosePolyclonal anti-(human TIMP-1) antibodies were prepared in sheep by intramuscular injection of the purified human TIMP-1 from U-937 cells (35Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant once and twice with incomplete Freund's adjuvant as described previously(36Okada Y. Takeuchi N. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Nagase H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1989; 48: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The antiserum obtained was shown to be specific for human TIMP-1 by Western blotting analysis. Sheep anti-(human TIMP-1) IgG isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (40% saturation) and DE-52 fractionation was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 and used as immunoadsorbent beads.Enzyme AssaysAll enzymic assays were carried out in TNC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Ca2+, 0.05% Brij 35, 0.02% NaN3). The collagenolytic activity of MMP-1 was measured using 14C-acetylated type I collagen (guinea pig) according to Cawston and Barrett(37Cawston T.E. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 was measured using heat-denatured 14C-acetylated type I collagen (guinea pig)(38Harris Jr., E.D. Krane S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One unit of collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activity degraded 1 μg of collagen or gelatin/min at 37°C.Purification of proMMP-9•TIMP-1 ComplexThe proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex was purified from the culture medium of TPA-treated HT-1080 cells. The medium was applied to a gelatin-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3. The column was washed with the same buffer, and proMMP-9 bound was eluted with same buffer containing 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The fractions were pooled, concentrated with an Amicon YM-10 membrane, and applied to Sephacryl S-300. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that most of the proMMP-9 eluted from the gelatin-Sepharose was in a complex with TIMP-1. Earlier fractions from the column of Sephacryl S-300 were pooled and used for experiments as the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex. A possible contamination of free proMMP-9 was examined by applying the purified complex (100 μg/ml, 100 μl) onto a column of anti-(human TIMP-1) IgG/Affi-Gel 10 (0.5 ml) equilibrated with TNC buffer. The unbound fraction (2 ml) and the bound material, eluted with 2 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 M urea, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified complex was essentially free of free proMMP-9.Purification of MMP-3 and MMP-1Human proMMP-3 was purified from the culture medium of rheumatoid synoviocytes and activated with chymotrypsin as described previously(39Nagase H. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Human proMMP-1 was purified from TPA-treated U-937 cell culture medium and activated by plasmin and MMP-3 according to Suzuki et al.(40Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Morodomi T. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10261-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). After activation, plasmin was inactivated by 2 mM DFP, and the 41-kDa MMP-1 was isolated by chromatography on anti-MMP-3 immunoadsorbent and on Sephacryl S-200. MMP-1 was free of MMP-3 and plasmin.Estimation of the Amount of the proMMP-9-TIMP-1 Complex, MMP-1, and MMP-3The amounts of the 41-kDa MMP-1 and the 45-kDa MMP-3 were estimated by titration with a known amount of TIMP-1. The amount of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex was estimated by titration of TIMP-1 in the complex with the known amount of MMP-1 or MMP-3, assuming the molar ratio of proMMP-9 to TIMP-1 of the complex is 1.Electrophoresis, Zymography, and Western BlottingSDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Bury(41Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-550Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and proteins were stained with silver nitrate(42Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Zymography was conducted using SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin (0.8 mg/ml) as described previously(35Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Enzymic activity was visualized as negative staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Western blotting was carried out according to Ito and Nagase(43Ito A. Nagase H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sheep anti-(human proMMP-9) IgG, sheep anti-(human TIMP-1) serum, sheep anti-(human MMP-3) serum, and/or sheep anti-(human MMP-1) serum were used as primary antibody, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-(sheep IgG) IgG was used as secondary antibody.RESULTSIsolation of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 ComplexThe conditioned medium of TPA-stimulated HT-1080 cells contained the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex as well as a small amount of free proMMP-9 and free TIMP-1. The gelatin-Sepharose step isolated the complex and free proMMP-9. The separation of the complex from free proMMP-9 was attained by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. Application of the final product to an anti-(human TIMP-1) immunoadsorbent column showed that the purified complex was virtually free of free proMMP-9 (Fig. 1). A very small amount of proMMP-9 (<3%) was found in the unbound fraction of the anti-TIMP-1 column (Fig. 1, lane 2), but it is not known whether this is due to partial dissociation of the complex or contamination of free proMMP-9. Nevertheless, neither case affects the interpretation of our studies, as the amount of free proMMP-9, if any, is very small.Lack of Enzymic Activity of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 Complex upon Treatment with APMA or TrypsinproMMP-9 is activated by APMA and trypsin(21Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4519-4583Google Scholar, 31Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex was treated with these agents, the gelatinolytic activity detected was negligible (Table 1). This suggests that TIMP-1 in the complex may inhibit the activated MMP-9 or prevent the activation of proMMP-9. SDS-PAGE analysis of the APMA-treated complex under reducing conditions indicated that proMMP-9 was mostly converted to an 84-kDa species and to a lesser extent an 82-kDa species (Fig. 2A). Zymographic analysis of the samples under nonreducing conditions indicated that only a small portion of the 82- and 80-kDa species showed gelatinolytic activity, suggesting that most of the converted MMP-9 was inhibited (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when proMMP-9 free from TIMP-1 was activated with APMA, the 80-kDa species was further converted to another active form of 68-kDa by an autolytic reaction as demonstrated previously(35Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Absence of the 68-kDa species in the APMA-treated complex further supports the notion that the enzymic activities of the 82- and the 80-kDa species are inhibited by TIMP-1. Treatment of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex with trypsin converted proMMP-9 to 82 and 68 kDa and four other smaller fragments (Fig. 3A). The TIMP-1 molecule was intact under these conditions (Fig. 3A). The 82- and 68-kDa species are identical to those generated with free proMMP-9 treated with trypsin(35Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similar to APMA treatment, trypsin-treated samples exhibited only a low gelatinolytic activity by zymography (Fig. 3B). Since no significant gelatinolytic activity was detected with these samples using 14C-acetylated gelatin in solution, a small activity detected by zymography might have resulted from partial dissociation of the active MMP-9•TIMP-1 complex due to SDS treatment. Indeed, when the APMA- or trypsin-treated complexes were subjected to Western blotting analysis for TIMP-1 under nonreducing conditions, a majority of TIMP-1 was located at around 90-100 kDa (data not shown), suggesting that the activated MMP-9 formed a complex with TIMP-1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:SDS-PAGE and zymographic analyses of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex treated with APMA.

Only proteolytically active enzymes are able to bind to α2M and form a large enzyme-inhibitor complex(44Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 737-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that an active MMP-9 bound to α2M stoichiometrically, which resulted in the shift of gelatin-lysis zones of activated MMP-9 in zymography(35Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Inability of the enzyme to bind to α2M is indicative of the lack of proteolytic activity. When the APMA- or trypsin-activated proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex was reacted with a 4-fold molar excess of α2M at 37°C for 1 h prior to zymographic analysis, all species exhibiting gelatinolytic activity by zymography failed to bind to α2M (Fig. 4), indicating that the APMA- or trypsin-activated proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex does not possess proteolytic activity.Figure 4:Lack of binding of the APMA- or trypsin-treated proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex to α2M. The proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex (10 μg/ml) was treated with 1 mM APMA for 24 h or trypsin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. Trypsin was inactivated with 2 mM DFP.

Fig. 5 shows the stoichiometric inhibition of MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) by the complex. When the complex was treated with APMA or trypsin, however, the inhibitory activity of the complex against MMP-1 was completely lost. This indicates that MMP-9 and TIMP-1 form a complex through their reactive sites after activation of proMMP-9 and the inhibitory domain of TIMP-1 is no longer available for other MMPs.Figure 5:Loss of MMP-1 inhibition activity of the proMMP-9•TIMP-1 complex upon treatment with APMA or trypsin.

https://openalex.org/W2020842716,"Senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease brain contain, in addition to beta amyloid peptide (Aβ), multiple proteoglycans. Systemic amyloidotic deposits also routinely contain proteoglycan, suggesting that these glycoconjugates are generally involved in amyloid plaque formation and/or persistence. We demonstrate that heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) inhibit the proteolytic degradation of fibrillar, but not non-fibrillar, Aβ at physiological pH. In accordance with the proteolysis studies, high affinity binding of proteoglycans to fibrillar Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) is observed from pH 4 to 9, whereas appreciable binding of HSPG or CSPG to non-fibrillar peptide is only seen at pH < 6. This differing pH dependence of binding suggests that a lysine residue is involved in proteoglycan association with fibrillar Aβ, whereas a protonated histidine appears to be needed for binding of the glycoconjugates to non-fibrillar peptide. Scatchard analysis of fibrillar Aβ association with proteoglycans indicates a single affinity interaction, and the binding of both HSPG and CSPG to fibrillar Aβ is completely inhibited by free glycosaminoglycan chains. This implies that these sulfated carbohydrate moieties are primarily responsible for proteoglycan•Aβ interaction.

Work from this laboratory (18Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that Aβ is also capable of association with a variety of glycosaminoglycan chains. The binding of Aβ with proteoglycan core protein and/or glycosaminoglycan chains provides an explanation for the localization of CSPG(10DeWitt D.A. Silver J. Canning D.R. Perry G. Exper. Neurol. 1993; 121: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), DSPG(11Snow A.D. Henderson M. Nochlin D. Kresse H. Wight T.N. J. Histochem.

Pathol. 1988; 133: 456-463PubMed Google Scholar) with senile plaques. It has been suggested that the association of proteoglycans with Aβ might result in an enhanced rate of fibrillation of the amyloid peptide (13Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or that proteoglycans may inhibit the degradation of Aβ(13Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Frederickson R.C.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1991; 13: 239-253Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Either of these actions could lead to increased numbers of senile plaques, with a concomitant increase of neuropathology. There is precedent for the glycosaminoglycan moieties of proteoglycans affecting protein breakdown, as heparan sulfate has been demonstrated to slow plasmin-mediated digestion of basic fibroblast growth factor(20Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined whether proteoglycans of the classes found associated with senile plaques are capable of decreasing the susceptibility of Aβ to proteolytic degradation. The results reveal that whereas both non-fibrillar and fibrillar Aβ can be readily cleaved by proteases, complexes of proteoglycan and fibrillar amyloid peptide are relatively resistant to breakdown. The polymeric form of Aβ binds proteoglycans with significantly greater affinity than does non-fibrillar peptide at physiological pH, and the association of CSPG and HSPG with fibrillar Aβ appears to be mediated primarily via glycosaminoglycan chains. These data thus supply the first indication that senile plaques in AD brain may accumulate and persist due to the inability of naturally occurring proteases to act on Aβ•proteoglycan complexes. EHS mouse HSPG was obtained commercially (Collaborative Biomedical Products). CSPG were purified from bovine nasal septum cartilage essentially as described(21Hascall V.C. Kimura J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 769-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Fibrillar Aβ(1-40) (Bachem Inc.) and Aβ(1-42) (synthesized at Gliatech Inc.) were prepared by resuspending lyophilized peptide in H2O (2 mM stock) and allowing the solutions to age for 1-3 weeks. The extent of fibril formation was quantified using a Thioflavin T fluorescence assay as described(26LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Non-fibrillar Aβ preparations were made by resuspending lyophilized peptide in hexafluoroisopropanol, with subsequent relyophilization. The hexafluoroisopropanol-treated lyophilized peptides were suspended in H2O (2 mM stock) and used within 3 days of solubilization. The non-fibrillar Aβ solutions did not bind Thioflavin T as determined by the absence of specific fluorescence. In a typical assay, non-fibrillar or fibrillar Aβ(1-40) (4.3 μg) and proteoglycans (30 μg) were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature in 10-15 μl final volume of Tris (0.1 M) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. Papain (2 μg) was subsequently added and the reaction mixture incubated at 37°C for 18 h. In some experiments, papain was replaced with cathepsin B (Sigma). In these studies, fibrillar Aβ(1-40) was incubated either in the presence or absence of CSPG as above, except in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, containing 120 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 μM dithiothreitol. Cathepsin B (0.1 unit) was subsequently added and incubated as above. Digested products were subjected to 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize undegraded 4-kDa Aβ, which was quantitated using a densitometer (PDI; model DNA 35). Additional studies were performed in which 30 μg each of chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate B, chondroitin sulfate C, heparin, (all from Sigma) or heparan sulfate (Seikagaku America, Inc.) were added as above instead of proteoglycan. Polyvinyl microtiter plates (Costar high binding) were coated with proteoglycans (2 μg/50 μl) in PBS buffer overnight at 4°C. After aspirating the proteoglycan solution, wells were blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Control wells were prepared as above, except proteoglycan was omitted from the initial overnight incubation. Aliquots (100 μl) of either fibrillar or non-fibrillar Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) at varying concentrations in blocking solution were added to the wells. Following a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the wells were extensively rinsed with PBS. Proteoglycan-bound Aβ was detected by the addition of mouse Aβ antibody (4G8 at 1:2000 dilution in blocking solution; antibody provided by Drs. K. S. Kim and H. M. Wisniewski, Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Diabetics, Staten Island, NY), which was allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the plate with PBS, a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:2000 dilution in blocking solution; Sigma) was added and allowed to incubate for 1 h. The plate was again rinsed thoroughly with PBS, and peroxidase-catalyzed color development was initiated by adding 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine substrate (Kirkegard & Perry, Inc.). The reaction was quenched by adding 100 μl of 1 M phosphoric acid, and the plates were read at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Dynatech). The ability of proteoglycans or glycosaminoglycans to inhibit Aβ binding to immobilized proteoglycans was evaluated by adding varying concentrations of these agents to a constant concentration of Aβ (typically 1-2 μM). The amount of Aβ bound in the wells was determined by subtracting control wells from the experimental wells. Data were analyzed as described below. Studies examining the pH-dependent binding of fibrillar and non-fibrillar Aβ(1-40) were performed as above in buffer systems containing 120 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 10 mM of each of the following buffers: sodium acetate, pH 4 and 5; sodium phosphate, pH 6, 7, and 8; sodium bicarbonate/carbonate, pH 9 and 10. The estimated Kd of fibrillar Aβ-proteoglycan interaction was based on the concentration of added Aβ ([Aβmonomers]) at 50% maximal binding (Microcal Origin program). Scatchard analyses of binding data were performed by plotting bound/free (OD450 nm/[Aβ]) versus bound (OD450 nm). The concentration of Aβ fibrils could not be accurately determined due to the uncertainty of fibril size (i.e. [Aβfibrils] = [Aβmonomers]/c, where c = number of Aβ monomers comprising an average fibril). The Kd values obtained based on monomeric Aβ concentration (Kd(monomer)) are thus greater than the true Kd values for fibrillar peptide (Kd(fibrilars) = Kd(monomer)/c,). To more accurately determine binding affinities, Ki values were obtained using proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans as competitive inhibitors of Aβ binding to immobilized proteoglycan. The Ki values were derived from, where L = the concentration of Aβ ([Aβmonomers]) used in the inhibition studies. Ki=IC501+(L/Kd(Eq. 1) can be utilized to obtain accurate Ki values with fibrillar Aβ, even with the uncertainty of fibril concentration. In this case, L would represent [Aβfibrilar], which can be replaced by the term ([Aβmonomer]/c). The Kd term in would be Kd(fibrilar), as described above. Substituting these terms into results in Ki=IC501+([Aβmonomer/c)/(Kdmonomer/c)=Ki=IC501+([Aβmonomer)/(Kdmonomer)(Eq. 2) [Aβmonomer] and Kd(monomer) are readily determined parameters. To determine whether proteoglycans can protect Aβ from proteolytic degradation, either non-fibrillar or fibrillar Aβ(1-40) were incubated for 1-2 h at pH 7.4 with or without HSPG and CSPG. The nonspecific protease papain was subsequently added to the mixtures, and after overnight incubation the extent of Aβ proteolysis was evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis. Both fibrillar Aβ(1-40) (Fig. 1 and 2) and non-fibrillar Aβ(1-40) (Fig. 2) were degraded by the protease in the absence of proteoglycan. Addition of CSPG or HSPG to the non-fibrillar peptide solution did not appreciably affect Aβ degradation (Fig. 2). In contrast, a significant amount of fibrillar Aβ(1-40) persisted following preincubation with both of the proteoglycans prior to papain treatment (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Essentially identical results were obtained when Aβ(1-42) was used instead of Aβ(1-40) or when papain was replaced with the nonspecific enzyme mixture Pronase (data not shown).Figure 2:Proteoglycan-mediated protection of Aβ(1-40) from proteolytic degradation. Non-fibrillar or fibrillar Aβ(1-40) and HSPG (lane C), bovine CSPG (lane D), or chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (lane E) were incubated at pH 7.4 and subsequently subjected to proteolysis with papain as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane A shows Aβ(1-40) in the absence of papain, while lane B reveals Aβ treated with papain in the absence of proteoglycan. The data are normalized to the amount of Aβ remaining after treatment relative to lane A conditions. The inset shows a similar study in which papain was substituted with cathepsin B. Lane A contains fibrillar Aβ(1-40) in the absence of cathepsin, lane B shows fibrillar Aβ(1-40) treated with cathepsin in the absence of CSPG, and lane C contains the amyloid peptide treated with cathepsin in the presence of CSPG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the results obtained with papain and Pronase extended to more specific and physiologically relevant proteases, we examined whether cathepsin B degrades Aβ in the absence or presence of CSPG. This enzyme has been shown to be released by microglia (25Fransson L.A. Havsmark B. Silverberg I. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and thus might represent one of the proteases found in the milieu of the brain. As with papain, cathepsin B cleaved fibrillar Aβ in the absence of proteoglycan, while CSPG inhibited cathepsin proteolysis of the amyloid peptides (Fig. 2, inset). The proteoglycan-mediated inhibition of Aβ degradation is most likely explained by steric shielding of the amyloid peptide by glycosaminoglycan chains, which should be naturally resistant to proteases. This would suggest that free glycosaminoglycans might also reduce the papain-catalyzed degradation of Aβ. However, neither chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 2, lane E), nor a variety of other glycosaminoglycans (data not shown) inhibited the proteolysis of either fibrillar or non-fibrillar Aβ. This indicates that intact proteoglycan is required for effective protection of amyloid peptide. Inhibition of fibrillar Aβ proteolysis by proteoglycans implied that these glycoconjugates were binding tightly to this form of the amyloid peptide. The reduction of Aβ degradation appeared to be specific to proteoglycans, since other proteins that are associated with senile plaques (C1q and laminin) had no effect on papain-mediated cleavage of Aβ (data not shown). To directly analyze proteoglycan association with Aβ, a solid-phase binding assay was developed in which proteoglycans were immobilized to the wells of microtiter dishes. Aβ was subsequently added, and bound peptide was quantitated via an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant methodology. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, neither HSPG or CSPG showed appreciable binding to non-fibrillar Aβ(1-40) or Aβ(1-42) at physiological pH. While virtually no binding of non-fibrillar amyloid peptides could be demonstrated with CSPG, the HSPG preparation consistently bound a small amount of both Aβ peptides (compare Fig. 3, A and C to B and D). However, the amounts of non-fibrillar peptides that associated with HSPG were very low compared to the amount of fibrillar Aβ(1-40) or Aβ(1-42) that bound to either CSPG or HSPG (Fig. 3). The ability of proteoglycans to bind substantial amounts of fibrillar, but not non-fibrillar, Aβ at pH 7.4 coincides with the proteoglycan-mediated inhibition of degradation of only the fibrillar form of amyloid peptide. Scatchard transformations of the binding data (Fig. 3, insets) reveal that the association of fibrillar Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) with both HSPG and CSPG is governed by a single affinity interaction. The actual affinities of fibrillar Aβ•proteoglycan binding were not calculated from these data, since the Aβ concentrations are expressed as monomeric peptide and thus overestimate the concentration of Aβ fibrils. The average amyloid fibril is likely to be composed of hundreds of monomers(29Shen C. Scott G.L. Merchant F. Murphy R.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2383-2395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To more completely characterize the nature of proteoglycan binding to Aβ, both fibrillar and non-fibrillar peptide preparations were examined for their ability to bind CSPG over a broad pH range. As seen in Fig. 4, the binding of proteoglycan to Aβ fibrils (closed circles) is relatively constant from pH 5-7, whereas at higher pH there is a decrease in CSPG-amyloid peptide interaction. Half-maximal binding is seen at ~pH 9, suggesting that the protonation of 1 or more lysine residues is necessary for proteoglycan binding to Aβ fibrils. In contrast, non-fibrillar Aβ did not associate with CSPG until pH values were 6 or lower (Fig. 4, open circles). This implies that binding of proteoglycan to the non-fibrillar peptide was governed, at least in part, by protonation of histidine(s). These data show that the nature of proteoglycan binding to the two forms of Aβ is significantly different, and only the fibrillar amyloid peptide would appear to play a role in proteoglycan binding at physiological pH. Since the saturation binding studies presented in Fig. 3 could not be used to accurately determine the affinities of proteoglycan•Aβ interaction, analyses were done in which HSPG and CSPG were added as competitive inhibitors of fibrillar Aβ binding to the immobilized proteoglycans (Fig. 5). The Ki values obtained for solution-phase proteoglycan inhibition of Aβ binding to substrate-attached HSPG and CSPG at pH 7.4 reveal high-affinity interactions of these proteoglycans with both Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) (see Table 1). Examination of the inhibition data by log-logit transformation suggested one class of non-interacting binding sites for both proteoglycans with either amyloid peptide (Fig. 5, insets). Therefore, the inhibition data are in agreement with the single affinity binding observed in the Aβ saturation analyses.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Although the binding of both CSPG and HSPG to fibrillar Aβ is governed by a single affinity interaction, it was not known whether the proteoglycan association was mediated via the core-protein, glycosaminoglycan chains, or a combination of both. To examine this question, free heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans were utilized as competitive inhibitors in the Aβ binding assay. Both of these anionic polysaccharides were effective inhibitors of amyloid peptide binding to HSPG and CSPG (Fig. 6), with their Ki values listed in Table 1. Again, log-logit transformation of these data (Fig. 6, insets) suggested single affinity, non-interacting binding sites. The ability of free glycosaminoglycans to completely inhibit amyloid peptide binding to proteoglycan would seem to indicate that the intact glycoconjugates complex with fibrillar Aβ via these sulfated sugar chains. The larger Ki values obtained with the glycosaminoglycans relative to the proteoglycans is likely to reflect the fact that there are many of these sugar moieties per proteoglycan molecule. For example, the proteoglycans bind Aβ(1-42) with affinities that are approximately 25-75-fold greater than those determined for the free glycosaminoglycans. However, the sugar content (by weight) per mole of the proteoglycans is 25-100 times that of the glycosaminoglycan chain preparations. In addition to proteoglycan association with Aβ being prevented by glycosaminoglycans of the same class as those of the immobilized proteoglycan, we found that free CS and HS polysaccharides could inhibit amyloid peptide binding to HSPG and CSPG, respectively (data not shown). The ability of dissimilar glycosaminoglycan chains to inhibit the binding of the same proteoglycan indicates that the binding of these polysaccharides to Aβ is relatively nonspecific with regard to sugar composition. A body of evidence is accumulating implicating Aβ and APP in the etiology of AD(30Cai X-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

Wight T.N. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Kivilevsky R. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 65-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Stenstad T. Magnus J.H. Husby G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In one study of peripheral amyloidosis(40Snow A.D. Kisilevsky R. Lab. Invest. 1985; 53: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar), the temporal deposition of proteoglycans appeared to occur concurrently with the formation of amyloid fibrils, suggesting that proteoglycans played an active role in plaque formation. The data presented here support the hypothesis that proteoglycans play an important role in the accumulation and persistence of plaques. We have found that mouse HSPG and bovine CSPG have the ability to bind fibrillar Aβ(1-40) and impart protection against proteolytic attack. An identical protective effect is elicited by CSPG purified from rat astrocytes (data not shown), indicating that this activity is not species-specific. Enzymes with relatively nonspecific substrate specificity (i.e. papain and Pronase) were employed in these studies since the stability of proteoglycan•Aβ complexes to such exhaustive proteolytic conditions would suggest similar resistance to proteases found in the brain. The inability of proteoglycans to affect the degradation of non-fibrillar Aβ reflects a relative lack of interaction with this form of peptide at physiological pH. Previous work from this laboratory (18Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) indicated that glycosaminoglycans only associated with the truncated Aβ(1-28) peptide at pH values below 7. This pH profile suggested that 1 or more histidine residues of Aβ(1-28) must be protonated for glycosaminoglycan binding. The pH dependence of proteoglycan binding to non-fibrillar Aβ shows a qualitatively similar profile, implicating histidine in the binding of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans to non-fibrillar Aβ. The binding of fibrillar Aβ to proteoglycans at pH 7.4 would imply, however, an interaction that is not mediated through glycosaminoglycan association with histidine(s). A significant reduction in proteoglycan binding to fibrillar Aβ is observed as the pH increases above 9, indicating 1 or more lysine residues are involved in the association. The critical lysine(s) is likely to reside in the Aβ sequence and not in the proteoglycan core protein since our data indicate that binding of the glycoconjugates is via glycosaminoglycans. The binding of proteoglycans to lysine residues within fibrillar Aβ would suggest that anionic groups of the former ion-pair with the amyloid fibril. It would seem likely that the sulfated sugars of glycosaminoglycans align with a positive-charge array formed from 1 or more lysine residues from each monomeric subunit of the assembled amyloid fibril. Both Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) fibrils showed comparable affinities for proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, suggesting that there were not significant differences in the arrangement of the residues critical to binding between these two forms of amyloid peptide. The binding of proteoglycan to the longer amyloid peptide may be of the most physiological relevance, as recent data suggest that Aβ(1-42) is found in larger amounts than Aβ(1-40) within the senile plaques of AD brain(41Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol.

Greenberg B. Fillit H.M. Brain Res. 1993; 627: 199-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that intact HSPG and chemically deglycosylated HSPG could bind to an Aβ(1-28) affinity column, leading these investigators to suggest that the core protein was involved in binding of intact proteoglycan. These authors also showed glycosaminoglycan-mediated binding of HSPG to Aβ. Since saturation binding analyses were not performed, it is not known whether they observed a single affinity interaction between intact HSPG and the truncated amyloid peptide. Because we have investigated binding of proteoglycans to full-length Aβ peptides, it is difficult to make direct comparisons between this prior study and the data presented here. It should be noted, however, that the deglycosylation of proteoglycans could expose regions of the core protein that would normally be sterically shielded by glycosaminoglycan groups, thereby revealing novel Aβ-binding sites. While our data indicate that Aβ fibrils bind proteoglycans through interaction with glycosaminoglycans, we cannot exclude the possibility that the small amount of non-fibrillar Aβ binding to HSPG observed at pH 7.4 (see Fig. 3, A and C) is mediated, in part, by core protein. No attempts were made to examine the nature of non-fibrillar Aβ-HSPG association through the use of glycosaminoglycan competition studies because of the very low signal obtained in the binding assay. Although proteoglycans bind fibrillar Aβ via glycosaminoglycan chains, these polysaccharide groups alone are not sufficient to inhibit proteolytic accessibility to the amyloid fibrils. The binding of one or a few glycosaminoglycan groups of a proteoglycan may allow the other sulfated polysaccharide moieties of that molecule to form an effective barrier around the Aβ fibril. Such a shield may not be formed when free glycosaminoglycan chains bind the amyloid peptide. The ability of proteoglycans to inhibit proteolysis of Aβ has important implications with regard to AD pathology. The association of HSPG with Aβ may be one of the precipitating events in the formation of stable plaque structures. HSPG has been shown to be present in cortical diffuse plaques(11Snow A.D. Henderson M. Nochlin D. Kresse H. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and there is belief that these structures are predecessors of senile plaques. Interestingly, diffuse plaques of the cerebellum lack HSPG(42Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R.T. Nochlin D. Kalaria R.N. Kimata K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 337-347PubMed Google Scholar), and cerebellar dense plaques with associated neuropathology are rare. Thus, HSPG may bind the initial few Aβ fibrils that form in diffuse deposits, and in doing so begin the transformation to senile deposits. The localization of CSPG and DSPG with senile plaques, and not diffuse deposits, suggests that these proteoglycans may associate with fibrillar Aβ later in the maturation process. Another notable difference between diffuse and senile neuritic plaques is the clear presence of activated glia within and around the latter(43Itagaki S. McGeer P.L. Akiyama H. Zhu S. Selkoe D.J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1989; 24: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 44Perlmutter L.S. Barron E. Chui H.C. Neurosci.

Aging. 1992; 13 (Suppl. 1): S89Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is possible that glia are responsible for the release of all or some of the proteoglycans that associate with senile plaques. CSPG are known to be inhibitory to axon growth(46Snow D.M. Lemmon V. Carrino D.A. Caplan A.I. Silver J. Exp. Neurol. 1990; 109: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and their association with plaques may cause some of the neuritic dystrophy characteristic of AD(37Canning D.R. McKeon R.J. DeWitt D.A. Perry G. Wujek J.R. Frederickson R.C.A. Silver J. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 124: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The demonstrated ability of proteoglycans to alter the proteolytic processing of Aβ suggests that drugs developed to inhibit the binding of these glycoconjugates to amyloid peptide might increase the turnover of Aβ by naturally occurring proteases, thereby providing therapeutic benefit to those suffering the consequences of this devastating disease.

Using human mononuclear leukocytes (MNL), we found that calcium ionophores could elevate βARK activity by about 80% in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner. This was confirmed by the ability of the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to produce a similar effect, suggesting a PKC-dependent modulation of βARK activity. In vitro experiments with purified proteins showed that PKC could directly phosphorylate βARK1 with an apparent Km for βARK1 of 6 nM. The ability of βARK1 to phosphorylate rhodopsin was 61% greater when it was phosphorylated by PKC. The level of phosphorylation of βARK1 immunoprecipitated from MNL and Sf9 cells overexpressing this kinase was enhanced by about 2-3-fold after PMA treatment. Functional significance of PKC-dependent increase in βARK activity was demonstrated by β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) homologous desensitization experiments in MNL. βAR desensitization, as induced by exposure to 10 μM isoproterenol (5 min at 37°C), was increased from 42 ± 10% in control to 68 ± 8% in PMA-pretreated MNL. βARK inhibitor heparin (160 μg/ml) prevented the augmenting effect of PMA on βAR desensitization. These results show that βARK activity can be increased through phosphorylation by PKC, thus indicating that βARK can be preconditioned to modulate the subsequent cellular responsiveness to receptor activation, providing the cell with a mechanism by which specific homologous desensitization can be regulated heterologously.

These receptors contain a highly conserved DNA binding domain consisting of two Zn-fingers that mediate the specific recognition of their respective hormone response elements (e.g. TREs for TRs) located in their target genes. The hormone binding domain is located at the carboxyl-half of the proteins and is unique to each hormone. In the presence of their cognate hormones, these receptors can either activate or repress the transcription of their target genes, depending on the promoter context. Studies in mammals and birds have shown that while TRs can bind to TREs as homodimers and more weakly as monomers, they form strong heterodimers with several other members of the receptor superfamily(3Tsai M.-J.

Indeed, numerous genes that are regulated directly or indirectly by thyroid hormone have been identified in different tissues of metamorphosing Xenopus laevis tadpoles(7Tata J.R. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Shi Y.-B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among these are the two TRα and two TRβ genes themselves. In addition, both TRα and TRβ genes are highly expressed during metamorphosis, suggesting that they participate in the regulation of the process. We provide here evidence that TRs and RXRs function together to mediate the regulatory effect of thyroid hormone on metamorphosis. First of all, we demonstrate that the Xenopus RXR genes are also expressed during metamorphosis. Furthermore, expression of both TR and RXR genes is highly tissue specific and its regulation in different tissues correlates strongly with tissue-specific transformation. In addition, we show that Xenopus TR-RXR heterodimers can bind to the TRE present in Xenopus TRβ genes with high specificity and affinity and activate the TRβ promoter in a hormone-dependent manner. RNA was isolated from whole tadpoles or individually dissected tadpole organs at different developmental stages as described(9Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. To show that equivalent amounts of total RNA were present, the blots were stained with methylene blue (10Herrin D.L. Schmidt G.W. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar) and the same or duplicated blots were hybridized with a cDNA probe for ribosomal protein L8 (rpL8), a gene whose mRNA is maintained at relatively constant levels during development(11Shi Y.-B. Liang V.C.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although there are two TRα (αA and αB) and two TRβ (βA and βB) genes in Xenopus and each of the TRβ genes gives rise to two receptor isoforms, the members in each subfamily are highly homologous(13Yaoita Y. Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose only TRαA and TRβA II for the analysis below. pSP64(A)-TRαA and pSP64(A)-TRβA II for in vitro synthesis of TR mRNAs were kind gifts from Dr. A. Kanamori (Carnegie Institution of Washington, also see (13Yaoita Y. Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)). The cDNAs for the entire coding regions of RXRα and RXRγ (12Blumberg B. Mangelsdorf P.J. Dyck J.A. Bittner D.A. Evans R.M. De Robertis E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2321-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into a modified pSP64poly(A) vector (Promega) 2M. Stolow and Y.-B. Shi, unpublished data. using the restriction sites introduced in the polymerase chain reaction primers to generate pSP64(A)-RXRα and pSP64(A)-RXRγ. The pSP64(A) plasmids containing TR and RXR cDNAs were linearized and transcribed in vitro using a SP6 kit (Ambion). The resulting capped mRNAs were purified and resuspended in water. Each mRNA was injected at a concentration of 100 ng/μl into the cytoplasm of about 30 stage VI Xenopus oocytes (27.6 nl/oocyte) as described (14Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 18°C, the oocytes were collected, rinsed once with modified Barth's medium(14Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and then homogenized in 600 μl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extracts were centrifuged twice at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min to remove yolk proteins and debris. To determine the relative levels of TRs and RXRs in the oocytes, mRNA for each receptor was coinjected with [35S]methionine (1 μCi/μl mRNA) into oocytes. The protein extracts were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The relative levels of unlabeled receptors were analyzed by Western blotting using a chemiluminescence kit from Amersham and polyclonal antibodies against recombinant TRβA II and RXRα(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the DNA binding activity of TR-RXR heterodimers, 0.5 μl of TR and RXR extracts were first mixed on ice for 10 min. The mixture or individual extracts were then used in the DNA binding and competition experiments as described previously(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.9-kilobase EcoRI fragment from the EcoRI site at −1.6 kilobase of TRβA promoter to the EcoRI site at +300 of the CAT reporter gene in pCAT-WT (15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into pBluescript KS(-) to generate pKS-TRβAe. The single-stranded pKS-TRβAe was then prepared as described(16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA was injected into the nuclei of the stage VI oocytes at a concentration of 50 ng/μl (23 nl/oocyte). When mRNAs for TRs and/or RXRs were used, they were injected into the cytoplasm (23 nl/oocyte at a total concentration of 10 ng/μl) 2-3 h before the injection of DNA, and the oocytes were incubated overnight in modified Barth's medium with 100 units of ampicilin and streptomycin in the presence or absence of 50 nM thyroid hormone T3 (3,5,3’-L-triiodothyronine). The injected oocytes(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Development. 1991; 112: 933-943PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were homogenized in 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (10 μl/oocyte). Half of the extract was transferred into a tube containing 500 μl of RNAzol TM reagent (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX) for RNA isolation and the remaining half was used to isolate DNA(14Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Primer extension with a primer located in the CAT gene was used to analyze the transcripts from the TRβA promoter as described(14Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The DNA isolated from the other half of the oocytes was analyzed by slot-blot hybridization to verify the amounts of injected DNA. The expression of Xenopus RXRα and RXRγ genes was initially examined using RNA from whole animals at various embryonic and metamorphosing stages. The mRNA level for RXRα gradually increased as zygotic transcription began after midblastula transition (stage 9) and reached highest values by stage 40, shortly after tadpole hatching at stages 35/36 (Fig. 1). The RXRα mRNA was then maintained at relatively constant levels throughout tadpole development and metamorphosis, resembling that of TRα mRNA(18Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RXRγ mRNA levels, which were relatively high in early embryos due to maternal storage(12Blumberg B. Mangelsdorf P.J. Dyck J.A. Bittner D.A. Evans R.M. De Robertis E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2321-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), gradually decreased to a minimum around neurula stages (stages 16/17) and was elevated slightly in pre- as well as metamorphosing tadpoles (Fig. 1). Although metamorphosis is initiated by the rising concentrations of endogenous thyroid hormone around stage 54, different tissues undergo their specific transformations at very different stages(17Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. North-Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1956Google Scholar). In particular, hindlimb development begins around stage 54 while tail resorption takes place mostly around stage 62 and later. Reflecting this stage dependence, the levels of at least the TRα mRNA correlate with metamorphosis in these different tissues(18Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19Kawahara A. Baker B.S. Tata J.R. Development. 1991; 112: 933-943PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shi Y.-B. Liang V.C.-T. Parkison C. Cheng S.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate whether such regulation exist for other receptors, mRNA levels for RXRα, RXRγ, and TRβ genes were determined in the tail, hindlimb, and intestine at different stages (Fig. 2 and 3). Like the TRα genes, the RXRα gene was found to be highly expressed in the tail around stages 62 to 64 when rapid resorption occurred, and in the hindlimb around stages 54 to 56 when limb morphogenesis took place. Very low levels of its mRNA were present in either the tail or the hindlimb at other stages. In the intestine, the RXRα mRNA was maintained at moderate levels throughout metamorphosis, again resembling the expression pattern of the TRα genes. Similarly, both RXRγ and TRβ genes were expressed at relatively high levels during tail resorption (stages 62-64, Fig. 3). Unlike the other receptor genes, TRβ mRNA levels in the hindlimb were low even during morphogenesis (around stage 56). In the intestine, both TRβ and RXRγ expression was elevated during remodeling, in contrast to that of the TRα and RXRα genes. On the other hand, it is worth pointing out that the absolute levels of TRα and RXRα mRNAs were higher than the corresponding values for TRβ and RXRγ mRNAs (data not shown; also see (20Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). However, the overall correlation of the mRNA levels of these genes with tissue-specific transformations strongly suggest that they all participate in metamorphosis. We have recently identified a TRE (xTRE) consisting of two near perfect direct repeat of AGGTCA separated by 4 base pairs in both TRβA and TRβB genes of X. laevis(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While little binding of the TRE by TRβ or RXRα produced in E. coli was observed, strong specific complexes were formed in the presence of both TRβ and RXRα. However, most of the proteins made in E. coli were insoluble, making it difficult to determine the relative binding affinity of different heterodimers. We, therefore, turned to Xenopus oocytes to generate functional receptors. When the receptor mRNAs were injected into oocytes, they were efficiently translated. By a combination of in vivo labeling with [35S]methionine and Western blotting with anti-Xenopus TR and RXR antibodies, we concluded that within a few folds, the amounts of receptors made were the same when equal amounts of mRNAs were injected into oocytes (Fig. 4). These experiments also showed that there were little endogenous TRs and RXRs in the oocytes even though their mRNAs appeared to be present during oogenesis(12Blumberg B. Mangelsdorf P.J. Dyck J.A. Bittner D.A. Evans R.M. De Robertis E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2321-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Kawahara A. Baker B.S. Tata J.R. Development. 1991; 112: 933-943PubMed Google Scholar). Such a conclusion is in agreement with recent results on TR levels in oocytes by Eliceiri and Brown (22Eliceiri B.P. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24459-24465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is also consistent with the DNA binding and transcription experiments described below. When the extracts from the oocytes injected with individual receptor mRNAs were tested for binding to xTRE, no complexes were detected (Fig. 5). However, when the extracts containing TRα or TRβ were mixed with those containing RXRα or RXRγ, the resulting extracts formed strong complexes with xTRE. Different combinations of receptors produced roughly equal binding. The addition of thyroid hormone T3 had little effect on the amount of complexes formed (not shown). These results indicate that heterodimers formed between any TR and RXR can bind to xTRE with similar affinities. To test the DNA-binding specificity by TR-RXR heterodimers, competition was performed with various known TREs. All complexes formed between xTRE and different combinations of TR-RXR heterodimers showed identical competition profiles (Fig. 6). The unlabeled xTRE itself competed very efficiently while its mutated version (mTRE), the mutations in which abolish the T3 dependence of the TRβ promoter in Xenopus tissue culture cells(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), failed to compete. In addition, a palindromic TRE made of two inverted repeat of AGGTCA (TREp) and the TRE present in the human growth hormone gene (TREgh), which differs from both TREp and xTRE, competed less efficiently for the complex formation. This same TRE sequence preference has also been found for mammalian TRs(23Glass C.K. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 313-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 24Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), consistent with the high sequence conservation among the mammalian and frog receptors. The fact that there is little TRs and RXRs in oocytes also made it possible to study the function of TRs. We took the advantage that when single-stranded plasmid DNA containing a reporter promoter is injected into oocytes, they undergo one round of replication and the resulting double-stranded DNA is quickly chromatinized to form templates with low levels of basal transcription(14Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, mRNAs of TRs or RXRs were individually or co-injected into oocytes first. Following a few hours of incubation to allow the synthesis of the receptors, single-stranded plasmid DNA containing the T3-inducible promoter of TRβA gene was injected and the promoter activity was determined by primer extension analysis of the transcribed RNA. The TRβA promoter exhibited a weak activity in oocytes in the absence of T3 and the addition of T3 had little effect on this activity (Fig. 7 A). Identical results were found with oocytes that were preinjected with only RXRα and RXRγ mRNAs. Similarly, when the promoter DNA was injected into oocytes preinjected with only TRα or TRβ mRNA, little or very low levels of activation was observed in the presence of T3 (Fig. 7A). In contrast, preinjection of various combinations of TR and RXR mRNAs resulted in suppression of the basal promoter expression and the addition of T3 relieved the suppression and led to strong activation. These results indicate that TR alone is either insufficient to activate the TRE-containing promoter or can only weakly activate the promoter. On the other hand TR-RXR heterodimers are strong activators of the TRE-containing promoter, in agreement with the TRE binding results discussed above. As a control, our Western blot and [35S]methionine labeling showed that the amounts of TRs and RXRs synthesized were similar (above). Furthermore, when the injected DNA from the same batch of oocytes used for RNA analysis were extracted and analyzed by hybridization, equal amounts of the plasmid DNA were present in all samples (Fig. 7B). As only the single-stranded plasmid injected into the nucleus would be replicated and protected from degradation, these results indicate that equal amounts of the promoter plasmid were present in all samples. Thus, the results above reflect the true functional difference between the TR-RXR heterodimers and TR or RXR homodimers. Four TR (two TRα and two TRβ) and two RXR (RXRα and RXRγ) genes have been cloned in X. laevis. We and others have shown that the TRβ genes are themselves directly regulated by T3(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kanamori A. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 739-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shi Y.-B. Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 733-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Machuca I. Esslemont G. Fairclough L. Tata J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 96-107PubMed Google Scholar). Our current work clearly demonstrate that both TRα and TRβ can form strong TRE-binding heterodimers with either RXRα or RXRγ. Furthermore, the TRE sequence preference is identical among different heterodimers and is the same as observed in mammals and birds, i.e. the direct repeats of AGGTCA separated by 4 base pairs being the stronger TRE than either TREp or TREgh. Using a tissue culture transfection assay, we have shown recently that the TRE in the TRβA gene appears to confer the repression of the promoter in the absence of T3 and the addition of T3 relieves this repression(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results here demonstrate that such repression is mediated by TR/RXR heterodimers. Furthermore, the addition of T3 leads to a strong activation of the promoter. In contrast, TRs alone have little or very small effects on TRβ promoter activity. This appears to differ from previous reports where cotransfection of a reporter plasmid together with a plasmid to overproduce only TR leads to T3-dependent transcription (e.g. see (30Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). However, RXRs and/or other heterodimerization partners for TR seem to be present in tissue culture cells(15Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, our transcription results are consistent with the TRE-binding property of TR homo- and heterodimers. However, it is worth mentioning that although we failed to detect DNA binding by TR monomers or homodimers, such weaker binding might be detectable under different conditions (e.g. see (30Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). The low level of transcriptional activity when TR mRNAs alone were injected into oocytes may be due to either this weaker binding by TRs alone or heterodimers formed by the TRs with the low levels of endogenous RXRs that eluded our Western blot and DNA binding assays. In any case, our results suggest that in developing tadpoles, unliganded TRs can repress TRE-bearing promoters in the absence of T3 and activate them in the presence of T3. The interesting regulation of amphibian metamorphosis by thyroid hormone has led to the cloning and analysis of the expression of TR genes in both X. laevis and Rana catesbeiana in several laboratories(18Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19Kawahara A. Baker B.S. Tata J.R. Development. 1991; 112: 933-943PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shi Y.-B. Liang V.C.-T. Parkison C. Cheng S.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Schneider M.J. Galton V.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Helbing C. Gergely G. Atkinson B.G. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that the regulation of not only TR but also RXR genes is highly tissue specific. In general, TR and RXR genes are coordinately regulated in different tissues. Currently it is unknown whether mRNA levels reflect protein levels. A recent quantification of TRα and TRβ levels in Xenopus suggest that in general, higher levels of mRNAs result in higher levels of the receptors(22Eliceiri B.P. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24459-24465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exception is that TRα protein levels did not correlate well with the mRNA levels during development in the tail and head, suggesting the existence of mechanisms to regulate translation and/or protein stability. Alternatively, TRα could undergo post-translational modifications during development which altered their ability to be immunoprecipitated and detected by Western blot. Thus, it is likely that TR and RXR protein levels are also coordinately regulated. Amphibian metamorphosis involves systematic transformation of every single organ of a tadpole. Different tissues metamorphose at very different developmental stages. For example, hindlimb morphogenesis takes place very early, around stages 54-56, and tail resorption takes place very late, after stage 60, while intestinal remodeling occurs between stages 58 and 66. Such stage-dependence can be controlled at several levels. First of all, the plasma T3 concentration peaks around stages 60 to 62 when drastic tissue transformation takes place. Second, we have shown recently that the expression a cytosolic T3-binding protein is inversely correlated with tissue metamorphosis, i.e. low levels in the hindlimb during morphogenesis and in the tail during resorption but high levels at other stages(21Shi Y.-B. Liang V.C.-T. Parkison C. Cheng S.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This suggests that the levels of free intracellular T3 could be regulated in a tissue dependent manner. Related to this, the Xenopus type III iodothyronine 5-deiodinase, which converts T3 into an inactive form, has also been suggested to play a role in regulating T3 levels(27St. Germain D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7767-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally the coordinated, tissue-specific temporal regulation of TR and RXR genes are likely to be an important factor in the timing of organ specific metamorphosis. Thus, in the hindlimb around stages 54-56, even though the plasma T3 levels are low, the high levels of TR and RXR expression could allow the activation of genes important for limb morphogenesis. Subsequently, as the limb undergoes growth and the expression of these genes are no longer required, the reduced expression of TRs and RXRs will lead to the down-regulation of these genes although the plasma T3 concentrations are even higher. On the other hand, intestinal remodeling takes place from stage 58, when its length begins to shorten, to stage 66, when secondary epithelial cell differentiation is complete. This is the period when high levels of T3 are present. Furthermore, TRβ and RXRγ expression are elevated even though the mRNA levels for TRα and RXRα do not change appreciably. Finally, in the tail before stage 50, TR and RXR expression is low, this coupled with factors that could reduce free intracellular T3 concentration, can effectively prevent metamorphosis to occur. After stage 60, the elevated expression of TRs and RXRs then activate the tail resorption process. Currently, it is unknown how these receptor genes are regulated. Clearly, factors other than the receptors themselves or T3 levels are involved. This is especially true in premetamorphic tadpoles when there is little T3. The high levels of TR and RXR mRNAs in the limb but not the tail or intestine in those tadpoles strongly suggest the importance of tissue-specific expression of yet unknown genes in receptor gene regulation. Whatever the underlying mechanism is, the tissue-specific regulation of the receptors and free cellular T3 levels also provides a molecular explanation for TRβ gene expression, which is directly regulated by T3. As TRα and RXRα are likely the predominant forms of TRs and RXRs at least in premetamorphic tadpoles based on absolute mRNA levels and protein quantification ((20Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (22Eliceiri B.P. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24459-24465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown), the activation of TRβ genes are probably mediated mostly by TRα-RXRα heterodimers. In the intestine, TRα and RXRα levels appear to be similar at all stages, thus TRβ expression would be expected to follow the levels of endogenous T3 as we have observed. In the tail, for the reasons discussed above, the activation of TRβ genes would be limited to the later period of metamorphosis. Finally, the relatively low levels of TRβ expression in the hindlimb is due first to insufficient amounts of T3 and later the down-regulation of TR and RXR genes. In conclusion, biochemical and tissue culture transfection studies have suggested that TR/RXR heterodimers mediate the effects of T3in vivo. However, it has been difficult to prove such a hypothesis as RXRs are likely involved in gene regulation by several different types of hormone receptors. On the other hand, thyroid hormone is the single most important hormone that controls the drastic organ remodeling during amphibian metamorphosis. Our demonstration of coordinated regulation of TR and RXR genes coupled with the functional studies, therefore, provide strong evidence for the importance of TR/RXR heterodimers in vivo.

Wolffe for helpful comments on the manuscript and T. Vo for its preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2088157575,"The possibility that Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells can provide an intact cell setting for reconstitution of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor with mammalian G protein subunits was explored. The 5-HT1A receptor was found to assume an uncoupled phenotype when expressed alone in Sf9 cells at relatively high levels (5-34 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein), i.e. agonist-binding to the receptor was characterized by a relatively high Kd and an insensitivity to GTP. Co-expression of the receptor with members of the αi“family” together with various combinations of β1 and γ subunits increased the affinity for agonists to that observed for the coupled form of receptor in mammalian cells, concomitant with conferrance of guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate sensitivity. The agonists employed were [3H]8-hydroxy-N, N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin ([3H] 8-OH-DPAT) and [125I]R(+)-trans-8-hydroxy-2-[N-n-propyl-N-(3′-iodo-2′-propenyl)amino]tetralin ([125I]8-OH-PIPAT). The binding of an antagonist, [125I]4-(2′-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2′-[N-(2′-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]ethyl] piperazine ([125I]p-MPPI), was unaffected by co-expression of G protein subunits. Both α and βγ subunits were required for optimal coupling. No differences were evident among αi1, αi2, αi3, αo, and αz when expressed with β1γ2 in this regard, nor among most permutations of β1γ subunits when expressed with αi1 (β1γ2≈β1γ3≈β1γ5 > β1γ1). αs and αq expressed with β1γ2 did not participate in coupling. These data support the conclusion that normal interactions between a mammalian receptor and a select array of G proteins can be established in intact Sf9 cells, and extend previous observations of 5-HT1A receptor coupling to Go and the pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein Gz. The possibility that Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells can provide an intact cell setting for reconstitution of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor with mammalian G protein subunits was explored. The 5-HT1A receptor was found to assume an uncoupled phenotype when expressed alone in Sf9 cells at relatively high levels (5-34 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein), i.e. agonist-binding to the receptor was characterized by a relatively high Kd and an insensitivity to GTP. Co-expression of the receptor with members of the αi“family” together with various combinations of β1 and γ subunits increased the affinity for agonists to that observed for the coupled form of receptor in mammalian cells, concomitant with conferrance of guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate sensitivity. The agonists employed were [3H]8-hydroxy-N, N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin ([3H] 8-OH-DPAT) and [125I]R(+)-trans-8-hydroxy-2-[N-n-propyl-N-(3′-iodo-2′-propenyl)amino]tetralin ([125I]8-OH-PIPAT). The binding of an antagonist, [125I]4-(2′-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2′-[N-(2′-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]ethyl] piperazine ([125I]p-MPPI), was unaffected by co-expression of G protein subunits.

Of the several subtypes of 5-HT receptors, the 5-HT1A subtype is among the most extensively characterized. Assays using the agonist [3H]8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) describe the properties of 5-HT1A receptors in various regions of the rat forebrain, where the receptor is postsynaptic, and in the dorsal raphe nucleus, where it is somatodendritic(2De Montigny C. Blier P. Chaput Y. Neuropharmacology. 1984; 23: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and to stimulation of K+ channels, while activation of presynaptic receptors leads only to stimulation of K+ channels(3De Vivo M.

The 5-HT1A receptor can exhibit different affinities for [3H]8-OH-DPAT depending on whether the receptor is coupled to a G protein(s). As assessed with membranes from rat brain or various transfected cells, the G protein-coupled form of receptor exhibits a Kd for [3H]8-OH-DPAT of about 1 nM, whereas the Kd of the uncoupled form is about 20 nM(16Chamberlain J. Offord S.J. Wolfe B.B. Tyau L.S. Wang H.-L. Frazer A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 618-625PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nenonene E.K. Radja F. Carli M. Grondin L. Reader T.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1822-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Conversion of the high- to the low-affinity form can be achieved with GTP or non-hydrolyzable analogues. GTP promotes dissociation of the G protein into monomeric α and heterodimeric βγ subunits, which in turn destabilizes the interaction between the G protein and receptor supporting high-affinity binding of agonists(18DeLean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mulheron et al.(19Mulheron J.G. Casanas S.J. Arthur J.M. Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W.

Using [3H]8-OH-DPAT, these investigators documented a Bmax of 150 fmol of receptor/mg of Sf9 cell membrane protein and a Kd of 3 nM. The relatively low value for the Kd is consistent with the coupling of the receptor to endogenous G proteins, an inference confirmed by a GTP-induced shift in Kd to 23 nM and by serotonin-promoted labeling of an αo-like subunit with [32P]GTP-azidoanilide. 5-HT1B, dopamine D4, and Substance P receptors, when similarly present at low levels in Sf9 cells, also exhibit GTP-sensitive binding of agonists(20Ng G.Y.K.

We verify here a predominantly uncoupled phenotype of the human 5-HT1A receptor when expressed at high levels in Sf9 cells. Using this phenotype as a starting point, we explored the possibility that Sf9 cells can provide an intact cell setting for reconstitution of the receptor with mammalian G protein subunits. Sf9 cells carry out a variety of co- and post-translational processing events which, although not as extensive as those occurring in mammalian cells, support a viable targeting of receptors and G protein subunits to the cell membrane. In this respect, Sf9 cells provide a level of organization beyond that achieved in vitro with proteins whose purification is difficult or (in the case of bacterially expressed proteins) that lack relevant covalent modifications. In distinction to mammalian cell models, Sf9 cells are free of potentially interfering seven transmembrane segment receptors, and the low level of endogenous G proteins permits more rigorous testing of mammalian subunits for their ability to interact with co-expressed receptors. We report here that human 5-HT1A receptors expressed in Sf9 cells can be induced to assume a coupled phenotype upon co-expression with an appropriate array of G protein subunits. Both α and βγ subunits are required for optimal coupling, with the selectivity for α subunits restricted to those of the αi family, i.e. αi1, αi2, αi3, αo, and αz. An interaction of the 5-HT1A receptor with Go and Gz, the distributions of which overlap extensively in mammalian brain, has not been previously reported.

A BglII site was introduced near the initiating methionine codon, and most of the 5′-untranslated sequence was eliminated, by the polymerase chain reaction using 5′-GAAGATCTGGCGCGCAGGCATGGAT-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-AACCACAACTAGAATGCAGTG-3′ (pDP5-specific) as the reverse primer (the BglII site is underlined, and the initiating codon is double underlined). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BglII and EcoRI to yield a 1.3-kilobase fragment with 11 authentic nucleotides 5′ to the initiating codon and 34 authentic (plus 11 pDP5-related) nucleotides 3′ to the stop codon. The BglII/EcoRI fragment was subcloned into the transfer vector pVL1392. Sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method verified that no mutations had been introduced by polymerase chain reaction. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with a combination of the recombinant transfer vector and a modified AcNPV DNA (BaculoGold™) according to the protocol provided by PharMingen (San Diego, CA).

Baculovirus containing recombinant DNA was isolated as described above. Sf9 cells were maintained in suspension culture in TNM-FH media containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1% pluronic F-68, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamycin at 27°C. For expression, cells were subcultured in monolayer and grown to ~60% confluency, at which time they were infected with one or more recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of at least 1 for each virus. Cells were harvested 48 h following infection, washed twice with 0.9% NaCl, and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. After 5 min on ice, cells were homogenized by repeated passage through a 26-gauge needle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min, and the resultant supernatants at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellets (membrane) were washed twice with the above buffer and resuspended at ~3 mg/ml protein. Binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT was carried out as described previously(33Hall M.D. El Mestikawy S. Emerit M.B. Pichat L. Hamon M. Gozlan H. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Each tube contained 20 μg of membrane protein in 500 μl of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.7), 0.1% ascorbic acid, 20 μM pargyline, and 0.1-50 nM [3H]8-OH-DPAT (~220 Ci/mmol, Amersham). Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 25°C, at which time the contents were filtered under vacuum on Whatman GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed 3 times with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer, placed in 5 ml of Ecolite liquid scintillation mixture, and counted by scintillation spectrometry. Specific binding was defined as the difference in radioactivity measured in the presence and absence of 10 μM 5-HT. The percentage of specific binding at the Kd was 90%. Maximum binding and Kd values were determined by Scatchard (34Scatchard G. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17795) Google Scholar) transformation of saturation binding data using unweighted linear regression analysis. Membranes (0.1-1.1 μg of protein per assay tube) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 9-800 pM [125I]R(+)-trans-8-hydroxy-2-[N-n-propyl-N-(3′-iodo-2′-propenyl)amino]tetralin ([125I]8-OH-PIPAT) (2200 Ci/mmol) or 12-1200 pM [125I]4-(2′-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2′-[N-(2′-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]ethyl]piperazine ([125I]p-MPPI) (2200 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 100 μl. When using [125I]8-OH-PIPAT, assays were carried out in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.7), 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Assays with [125I]p-MPPI were carried out in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.7), 100 μM Gpp(NH)p, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Assays were terminated by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mM Tris, 7.4). Filtration was carried out using a Brandel cell harvester with glass fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell No. 32, previously soaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine) followed by washing with 15 ml of ice-cold wash buffer. Specific binding was defined with 10 μM ([125I]8-OH-PIPAT assay) or 100 μM ([125I]p-MPPI assay) 5-HT. The percentage of specific binding at the Kd was 67% for [125I]8-OH-PIPAT and 72% for [125I]p-MPPI. Maximum binding and Kd values were determined by Scatchard transformation as described above. Sf9 cells expressing 5-HT1A receptors and/or G protein subunits were harvested 44 h following infection and resuspended in methionine-free Graces insect cell media containing 10% fetal calf serum. [35S]Methionine was added (50 μCi/ml), and the cells incubated for an additional 4 h at 27°C. For studies of phosphorylation, cells were incubated for 4 h in TNM-FH media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/ml). For studies of palmitoylation, the cells were incubated for 4 h in serum-free TNM-FH media containing [3H]palmitic acid (250 μCi/ml). Antibodies used are listed in Table 1. Antibodies recognizing G protein α and β subunits have been described previously(35Woolkalis M.J. Nakada M.T. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Immunotransfer blotting was accomplished by solubilizing membranes prepared from uninfected or infected Sf9 cells (50 μg of membrane protein) in Laemmli sample buffer at 37°C for 30 min. Extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes incubated sequentially with rabbit antisera (1:100), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin, and H2O2 plus 4-choro-1-napthol(37Williams A.G. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. Manning D.R. Gewirtz A.M. Brass L.F. Blood. 1990; 76: 721-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, 125I-protein A was used for detection.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For immunoprecipitation, Sf9 cell membranes were solubilized in 0.5% SDS, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), and 2 mM EDTA at 25°C for 30 min. Samples were supplemented at 4°C to achieve 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.5% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin, and 200 mg/ml leupeptin. Selected rabbit antisera were added (1:10), followed 18 h later by protein A-Sepharose(37Williams A.G. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. Manning D.R. Gewirtz A.M. Brass L.F. Blood. 1990; 76: 721-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitates were collected and washed in buffered 0.5% Triton X-100. α subunits were quantitated where indicated by Western blots using antiserum 8645. 8645 was generated with a peptide common to αi1, αi2, αi3, αo1, and αt, and also present in αz and αq except for a valine in place of phenylalanine at the N terminus. Gt purified from bovine retinal rod outer segments (40Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) was typically added to membranes of uninfected Sf9 cells just prior to SDS-PAGE to provide an external standard. Colorimetric intensities were linear and bracketed the intensities of subunits expressed following infection. Gt contains β1 as its sole β subunit, permitting quantitation of β1 expression in Sf9 cells with antiserum 8136. Cholate extraction of membranes was accomplished where indicated by addition of sodium cholate to resuspended membranes to a concentration of 1%, followed by incubation for 1 h on ice. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Expression of the human 5-HT1A receptor in Sf9 cells was initially evaluated using the agonist [3H]8-OH-DPAT. Forty-eight hours following infection of the cells with recombinant baculovirus encoding the receptor, substantial levels of the receptor were found to exist (Fig. 1). Bmax values ranging from 5 to 22 pmol/mg membrane protein were observed, with Kd values between 7 and 18 nM. Binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT did not occur prior to infection, and the binding at 48 h was insensitive to GTP (Fig. 2). In separate experiments with rat hippocampal membranes (Bmax = 230 fmol/mg protein; Kd of the high-affinity site = 0.4 nM), GTP caused a 54% reduction in binding, consistent with published results(41Schlegel J.S. Peroutka S.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The high Kdof the receptor in Sf9 cells and the GTP insensitivity of agonist binding to this receptor were consistent with expression of the receptor in a predominantly uncoupled state.Figure 2:Effects of GTP on binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT. Specific binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT (2.2 nM) was determined in the presence and absence of 100 μM GTP for membranes isolated from noninfected Sf9 cells (“-5-HT1A receptor”) and from Sf9 cells 48 h following infection with recombinant baculovirus encoding the 5-HT1A receptor (“+5-HT1A receptor”). Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To ascertain the extent to which the 5-HT1A receptor in Sf9 cells was subject to co- or post-translational forms of processing, expression was analyzed by Western blots and metabolic labeling. Antibodies recognizing the 5-HT1A receptor were generated using sequences present in three different regions of the receptor, intracellular loop 2 (antiserum “DP”), outer loop 2 (“RT”), and intracellular loop 3 (“EV”) (Table 1). Each of the three antibodies revealed four closely spaced protein bands in Western blots (bands a-d (39-45 kDa), Fig. 3). None of the four bands was detected with preimmune sera, nor were any detected in uninfected Sf9 cells, Sf9 cells expressing β3-adrenergic or dopamine D3 receptors, or Sf9 cells infected with wild-type virus alone. Thus, recognition is specific for the 5-HT1A receptor. The appearance in Sf9 cells of closely spaced bands near the molecular weights deduced from cDNAs has been described previously for β-adrenergic (24Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J.

The four bands were also identified by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled protein (Fig. 4). To determine whether any of the protein species represented by these bands were substrates for phosphorylation or palmitoylation, cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate or [3H]palmitate. All four bands were evident as substrates for phosphorylation. Only two (bands a and b) were substrates for palmitoylation.Figure 4:Biosynthetic labeling of the 5-HT1A receptor. Sf9 cells expressing the 5-HT1A receptor (44 h post-infection) were incubated for 4 h in media containing [35S]methionine, [32P]orthophosphate, or [3H]palmitate, and immunoprecipitation was subsequently achieved using solubilized cell membranes and the EV antiserum. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by fluorography (3H; 30-day exposure using ENHANCE) or autoradiography (35S and 32P; 7- and 10-day exposures, respectively, using an intensifying screen for the latter). None of the radiolabeled bands in the 39-45-kDa range were detected when preimmune serum was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We suspect, based on previous observations(19Mulheron J.G.

In confirmation of the findings by Mulheron et al.(19Mulheron J.G. Casanas S.J. Arthur J.M. Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12954-12962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a G protein α subunit that resembles αo was found in Sf9 cells. The 40-kDa subunit(s) was detected by Western blotting using antiserum 1398, which recognizes αi and αo, and 9072, which is specific for αo (Fig. 5). No protein was detected with 8730, which recognizes αi1, αi2, and, to a lesser extent, αi3, thus ruling out appreciable quantities of these mammalian forms of αi in Sf9 cells. An αq/11-like protein, having an apparently larger molecular size than the αo protein, was detected with 0946. Two proteins react with the αs-directed antibody 1190. No protein was detected with antisera 2919 (αz), 120 (α13), and 130 (α16) (not shown). Surprisingly, a 40-kDa protein was recognized by 1521. 1521 is directed toward αi2 and also recognizes αz. Given the absence of αi2 and αz as deduced with 8730 and 2919, 1521 must either cross-react with the αo-like subunit present in Sf9 cells or recognize another protein (subunit) altogether. Having established expression of the 5-HT1A receptor in Sf9 cells, and an essentially uncoupled phenotype, the effects of αs (αs-s), αi1, αz, and αq on the affinity for [3H]8-OH-DPAT were assessed. In these experiments, a low concentration of agonist was used (0.5 nM) so that an increase in affinity concomitant with coupling would be detected as an increase in binding. All four subunits were expressed in Sf9 cells together with 5-HT1A receptors as detected with the relevant antibodies (Fig. 6). αz was found to promote a small increase in the binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT, while αq caused a small decrease (Fig. 7). αs and αi1 were without effect.Figure 7:[3H]8-OH-DPAT binding to the 5-HT receptor co-expressed with G protein subunits in Sf9 cells. Specific binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT at 0.5 nM was determined for membranes prepared from Sf9 cells expressing the 5-HT1A receptor, α subunits, and β1γ2 as indicated. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of 5-24 individual experiments assayed in triplicate.

Expression of the has operon was shown to be required for the synthesis of the hyaluronic acid capsule in group A streptococci. Previous studies indicated that some group A and group C streptococcal strains produce the hyaluronic acid capsule, while others do not. In addition, it was observed that encapsulated strains cultured in stationary phase of growth lose the hyaluronic acid capsule. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of the hyaluronic acid capsule in group A streptococci was investigated. In this study, it was determined that all encapsulated and unencapsulated strains of group A streptococci as well as encapsulated group C streptococci analyzed possess the has operon locus. The acapsular phenotype was accounted for by the absence of hyaluronate synthase activity in the membrane and not the production of extracellular hyaluronidase. A has operon mRNA transcript was not expressed by unencapsulated strains of group A streptococci, whereas encapsulated strains of group A streptococci grown to mid to late exponential phase produced the hyaluronate capsule, as well as has operon mRNA. However, as the streptococci entered the stationary phase of growth, they became acapsular and this was concomitant with the loss of has operon mRNA transcript. These results were confirmed by primer extension analyses of RNA isolated from encapsulated and unencapsulated strains of group A streptococci as well as RNA prepared from encapsulated strains cultured in exponential and stationary phases of growth. Thus, the loss of has operon mRNA in unencapsulated group A streptococci, as well as growth phase regulation occurs at the previously mapped has operon promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1994998604,"Hsp47 and cyclophilin B (CyPB) are residents of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Both of these proteins are closely associated with polysome-associated α1(I) procollagen chains. Hsp47 possesses chaperone properties early during the translation of procollagen while the cis/trans-isomerase properties of CyPB facilitate procollagen folding. In this report, we further investigate the interaction of these proteins with procollagen I during export from the ER. To inhibit vesicular budding and retain procollagen within the ER, cells were treated with the heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor mastoparan or calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of diacylglycerol/phorbol ester binding proteins. To arrest procollagen in pre-Golgi intermediate vesicles, cells were treated with guanosine 5ʹ-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Pulse-chase experiments of cells labeled with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation during the chase period with anti-procollagen, anti-Hsp47, and anti-CyPB antibodies were performed to reveal the relationship between Hsp47/CyPB/procollagen I. The distribution of procollagen, Hsp47, and CyPB to the ER and/or pre-Golgi vesicles was verified by immunofluorescence. Hsp47 and CyPB remained associated with procollagen retained within the ER. Hsp47 and CyPB were also associated with procollagen exported from the ER into pre-Golgi intermediate vesicles. Treatment of cells with cyclosporin A diminished the levels of CyPB bound to procollagen and diminished the rate of Hsp47 released from procollagen and the rate of procollagen secretion, suggesting that Hsp47 release from procollagen may be driven by helix formation. Also, these studies suggest that Hsp47 may resemble protein disulfide isomerase and possess both chaperone and anti-chaperone properties. During translation, high levels of Hsp47 are seen to limit protein aggregation and facilitate chain registration.

An important feature of native triple helical structure of procollagen is that this structure can include only trans-peptide bonds. However, it has been estimated that 16% of the X-Pro bonds and 8% of the X-Hyp bonds in nascent type I collagen are in cis- rather than trans-confirmation(9Sarkar S.K. Young P.E. Sullivan C.E. Torchia D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4800-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since, the temperature for folding kinetics of collagen is consistent with the normal Arrhenius activation energy for cis/trans-isomerization of peptide bonds, cis/trans-isomerization is considered to be a significant factor in collagen folding(10Bachinger H.P. Morris N.P. Davis J.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Fischer G. Wittmann-Leibold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X.

Consequently, when some of these enzymes are inhibited by the addition of cyclosporin A (CsA), the rate of in vivo folding of collagen is retarded(13Steinmann B. Bruckner P. Superti-Furga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1299-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclophilin proteins (CyPs) are a highly conserved family of PPiases expressed ubiquitously in prokaryotes and eukaryotes(14Hohman R.J. Hultsch T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 663-672PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). These proteins act as intracellular receptors for the immunosuppressant CsA(17Quesniaux V.F.J. Schreier M.H. Wenger R.M.

The cyclophilin family, like heat shock proteins, possesses a conserved core domain flanked by variable domains at the N and C termini(15Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S.

Consequently, CyPs have been classified into several isoforms; CyPA is cytosolic, while CyPB-C and the Drosophila cyclophilin, ninaA, possess ER signal sequences directed to the secretory pathway (19Colley N.J.

Furthermore, ninaA and rhodopsin Rh 1 colocalize to secretory vesicles, suggesting the Rh 1 requires ninaA as it travels through the distal compartments of the secretory pathway(19Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A number of ER resident proteins, designated as molecular chaperones, have been associated with polysome-associated pro-α1(I) chains(28Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These have included the GRP78/Bip, GRP94, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and Hsp47, which appear to function in a series of coupled or successive reactions during procollagen production and assembly(30Ferreira L.R. Norris K. Smith T. Hebert C. Sauk J.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). While investigating the relationship between various molecular chaperones and evolving procollagen chains associated with dense polysomes, a 20.6-kDa protein was observed to be closely associated with procollagen, Hsp47, PDI, GRP78, and GRP94. Here, we report this 20.6-kDa protein to be a CyPB that associates early in the translation/translocation of procollagen and may function in consort with other ER resident proteins to prevent aggregation of nascent chains, mediate proline isomerization(3Gilmore R. Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and possibly improve the catalytic effect of protein disulfide isomerase(31Schoenbrunner E.R. Schmidt F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4510-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also, CyPB and Hsp47 were localized to the ER and to pre-Golgi intermediate vesicles associated with procollagen, suggesting that Hsp47 and CyPB have a role in procollagen sorting and transport. Mouse 3T6 cells obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection were used in all experiments. The cells were grown and maintained in plastic flasks using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1.16 g/liter glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml ascorbate, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C. In those instances when it was necessary to label proteins, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml, DuPont NEN) for varying periods (see figure legends). Dense polysomes were prepared after a modified protocol of Kirk et al.(32Kirk T.Z. Evans J.S. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5540-5545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In essence, Mouse 3T6 cells were grown to near confluence as described above, and protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 10 min. In some instances, cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was used to determine the near neighbors of polysome-associated proteins(28Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in buffer A (0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.24 M KCl, 0.0075 M MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 0.2 mg/ml heparin, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.16 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.78 mg/ml benzamidine), and Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 2%. The cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was collected and the volume adjusted to 5 ml with buffer A. The supernatant (2.5 ml) was then layered on top of 1 ml of 1 M sucrose layered over 1.5 ml of 2 M sucrose. The samples were centrifuged for 12 h in a Beckmann SW 55 Ti rotor at 100,000 × g. Polysomes were collected, washed with water, suspended in Q-Sepharose buffer (0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.24 M KCl, 0.0075 M MgCl2), and applied to a 3-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described by Bergman and Kuehl (33Bergman L.W.

Chem. 1987; 262: 5540-5545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting flow-through fraction contained tRNA-free nascent chains. The retained tRNA-bound material was eluted with 1.0 M NaCl. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto Problot membranes at 50 mA for 3 h. The Problot was then soaked in blotting buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol). The Problot was stained with Coomassie Blue G for 30 s and then destained using acetic acid/methanol/water (1:1:18, v/v) for 12 h. The membranes were dried, and the PPi band was cut for N-terminal sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from ≈108 3T6 mouse cells using a Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). The first strand cDNA synthesis reaction was catalyzed by superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (RT) (Life Technologies, Inc.) with either of two 5ʹ-end-specific primers and one 3ʹ-end-specific primer for mouse CyPB(34Hasel K.W. Glass J.R. Godbout M. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3484-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The resulting products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using β-actin primers and product as a control(35Yokai H. Natsuyama S. Iwai M. Noda Y. Mori T. Mori K. Fujita K. Nakayama H. Fujita J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments were ligated into the Invitrogen TA cloning system and subsequently sequenced to verify the polymerase chain reaction product. Sequencing was achieved using the Sequenase kit 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Samples for gel electrophoresis were suspended in Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer and boiled for 5 min before loading onto 4-20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gels after the method of Laemmli(36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, dried, and autoradiographed using the method of Bonner and Laskey(37Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins run on SDS-PAGE were immediately electrotransferred to nitrocellulose paper. The paper was blocked with 10% non-fat dry milk in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9 M NaCl (TBS) for 1 h and then in TBS/non-fat dry milk with 2% normal goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Antiserum or preimmune serum was diluted 1:2000 in the same buffer and incubated with gentle shaking overnight. The nitrocellulose was then rinsed three times for 5 min in TBS/Tween. The secondary antibody, affinity-purified biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, MD) was diluted to 0.9 μg/ml and incubated with the paper for 2 h. Washing between steps was performed three times for 30 min with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.9 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4. The blot was visualized using ECL Western blot protocol (Amersham Corp.). Hsp47 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were prepared against a 22-mer peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of mouse Hsp47 that was conjugated to Keyhole limpet hemocyanin and was cross-reactive with mouse 3T6 Hsp47(38Sauk J.J.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse α1(I) procollagen antibodies were made from acid-soluble procollagen derived from lathyritic mouse skin(28Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol.

Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were made against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal decapeptide (VEKPFAIAKE) of CyPB (34Hasel K.W. Glass J.R. Godbout M. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3484-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and affinity purified on a peptide column. The antibodies were further characterized by Western blot to CyPB that was expressed in Escherichia coli containing the CyPB expression plasmid(34Hasel K.W. Glass J.R. Godbout M. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3484-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Notably, these antibodies failed to show any reactivity to purified CyPA (Sigma) in Western blots. Cells were freed from the support medium with trypsin (0.025% EDTA (0.02%) and treated with bacterial collagenase (0.01%) and 10% fetal calf serum for 3 min to block trypsin activity and remove extracellular collagen. The samples were suspended in a equal volume of 2 × immunoprecipitation buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, 0.3 M NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 2% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, pH 7.2 containing apyrase (Sigma) to deplete ATP). The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and a 50-μl sample of the radiolabeled supernatant was added to a mixture of protein A-Sepharose and antibody in PBS-azide. The samples were then incubated at 4°C with constant shaking and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with PBS-azide. The final pellets were suspended in 2 × gel electrophoresis sample buffer, heated for 10 min at 90°C, and then centrifuged to remove protein A-Sepharose. Samples of the supernatants were counted in a scintillation counter, and another sample was analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography as described above. To limit procollagen transport to pre-Golgi intermediate vesicles, cells were permeabilized with digitonin (39Plunter H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and incubated in the presence of 25 μM GTPγS for various periods up to 60 min (40Schwaninger R. Plunter H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To inhibit vesicular budding and retain procollagen within the ER, cells were treated with the heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor mastoparan (17 μm)(40Schwaninger R. Plunter H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Also, in some experiments cells were treated with calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of the highly conserved cysteine-rich C6H2 motif present in the regulatory domain of protein kinase C(41Fabbri M. Bannykh S. Balch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26848-26857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these studies, 120 nm of calphostin C was added from a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. To ensure that inhibition by calphostin was specific, parallel control samples were run in the dark since this inhibitor behaves as a caged substrate when activated by exposure to light(41Fabbri M. Bannykh S. Balch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26848-26857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit further protein synthesis. Fixed cells were blocked with 5% swine serum in PBS, and the Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin before incubation with antibody(39Plunter H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Before the addition of the second primary reagent to detect Golgi marker proteins (α-1,2-mannosidase II), cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin for 20 min in PBS/swine. Cells were subsequently washed and exposed to the primary antibody. Rabbit primary antibodies were detected with either a fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit IgG or Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted in Moviol (Calbiochem-Behring Corp.) and viewed in Axiovert microscope (Carl, Zeiss, Oberochen, Germany). PPi activity was determined in a standard coupled chymotrypsin assay utilizing N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide(42Fischer G. Bang H. Mecl C. Biomed. Bichim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar). To study procollagen processing, 3T6 mouse fibroblasts were labeled with [35S]methionine, and dense procollagen polysomes were prepared after the method of Kirk et al.(32Kirk T.Z. Evans J.S. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5540-5545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting polysomes were then fractionated using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography to yield two pools of procollagen. One pool consisted of elongating procollagen bound to peptidyl-tRNA that was initially retained (RT) and eluted with salt. The flow-through fraction consisted of recently completed nascent chains that were disrupted during column fractionation. The eluted RT fraction was then immunoprecipitated with anti-collagen I antibodies. Hsp47 was noted to coimmunoprecipitate with nascent procollagen I α chains. In addition to Hsp47, GRP78, and GRP94, an additional 20.6-kDa protein was recovered in immunoprecipitates associated with peptidyl tRNAs (Fig. 1). Measurement of the PPiase activity of the dense polysome preparation, Q-Sepharose fractions, and immunoprecipitates revealed an enrichment in PPiase activity (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Previous studies had also shown that microsomes may possess a high PPi activity that is inhibited by CsA. Furthermore, this activity was attributed to a protein belonging to the CyPB family(43Bose S. Mucke M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To ascertain if the 20.6-kDa protein precipitating with procollagen nascent chains was a member of the CyPB family, the RT fraction was separated by PAGE electroblotted onto Problot membranes, and the 20.6-kDa band was cut out of the membrane for N-ternimal sequencing. The resulting sequence NDKKKGPKVTVKVYFDLQIG was identical to that previously reported for mouse CyPB (34Hasel K.W. Glass J.R. Godbout M. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3484-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) being rich in lysine and thus distinct from mitochondrial cyclophilins that possess a serine-rich N-terminal extension(44Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To further characterize this protein, we sought to determine if this protein possessed an N-terminal signal sequence that directs the protein to the ER and a C-terminal decapeptide extension distinct from cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of cyclophilin(43Bose S. Mucke M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To address these questions, total RNA was isolated from ≈108 3T6 mouse cells using a total RNA isolation system (Promega). The first strand cDNA synthesis reaction was then catalyzed by SuperScript II RNase H-RT (Life Technologies, Inc.). Next, the protein-coding region was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (45Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar) with either of two 5ʹ-end-specific primers and one 3ʹ-end-specific primer (see “Materials and Methods”). The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments were ligated into the Invitrogen TA cloning system and subsequently sequenced. These results verified that the amplified products from mouse 3T6 cells were identical to CHP2 (CyPB)(34Hasel K.W. Glass J.R. Godbout M. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3484-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As such, this sequence contained 25 amino acids (MKVLFAAALIVGSVVFLLLPGPSVA) that resembled a signal sequence and a predicted cleavage site between Ala-25 and Asn-26, in which the resultant protein would result in a 20.6-kDa final product. In addition, the protein concluded with a C-terminal VEKPFAIAKE, distinct from cytosolic and mitochondrial cyclophilins(43Bose S. Mucke M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal decapeptide of CyPB in Western blots showed reactivity against the 20.6-kDa protein in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-collagen or anti-Hsp47 antibodies (Fig. 1). Also, when the dense polysome Q-Sepharose-retained fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-CyPB antibodies, a number of proteins were noted to coimmunoprecipitate with CyPB. Some of these proteins were identified by susceptibility to digestion by bacterial collagenase and/or Western blot analysis as procollagen, PDI, Hsp47, and the translocon component Sec61p (Fig. 2). To determine whether CyPB was retained within the ER as previously suggested (45Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar) or implied further in the secretory pathway, cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine chased in cold medium in excess of the labeled amino acid and immunoprecipitated with various antibodies. These data revealed that Hsp47 and CyPB were both closely associated with procollagen during the first 10 min of the chase period. However, subsequently both proteins progressively dissociated from procollagen and were unassociated with secreted procollagen in the medium (Fig. 3). To limit procollagen secretion to certain compartments within the secretory pathway, cells were treated with agents that inhibited diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-binding proteins (41Fabbri M. Bannykh S. Balch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26848-26857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or multiple GTP-binding proteins including heterotrimeric G protein(s)(40Schwaninger R. Plunter H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of the highly conserved cysteine-rich C6H2 motif present in the regulatory domain of protein kinase C, is known to be a potent inhibitor of vesicular budding from the ER (41Fabbri M. Bannykh S. Balch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26848-26857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was utilized to retain procollagen in the ER without directly modifying the procollagen post-translational modification. Export from the ER was also inhibited by mastoparan, a peptide that mimics G protein-binding regions of seven transmembrane-spanning receptors activating and uncoupling heterotrimeric G proteins from their cognate receptors(40Schwaninger R. Plunter H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In both instances, immunoprecipitation of the procollagen revealed that Hsp47 and CyPB remained bound to procollagen compared to untreated cells (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple GTP-binding proteins (40Schwaninger R. Plunter H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and a novel protein containing a C6H2 motif serve as a link in a signaling pathway regulating vesicle budding from the ER(41Fabbri M. Bannykh S. Balch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26848-26857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that both inhibitors were effective, the media were collected, and proteins were precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE. In both instances, no radiolabeled procollagen was detected in the medium. In addition, cells were also monitored by indirect immunofluorescence to verify that procollagen was retained within the ER. These studies confirmed that cells treated with either calphostin C and mastoparan retained procollagen, Hsp47, and CyPB to the ER region (Fig. 6).Figure 5:Comparison of kinetics of CyPB-bound procollagen in control, mastoparan, calphostin C, and GTPγS-treated 3T6 cells. Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described above, and samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-procollagen antibodies separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiograms prepared (see “Materials and Methods”). The bands representing CyPB were scanned using a densitometer. The value of the relative density before chasing was designated as 1 unit. The mean values and the standard deviations from at least three independent experiments are plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:A, distribution of Hsp47, CyPB, and procollagen I in 3T6 cells after modulation of ER to Golgi transport.

Arrows indicate staining of Golgi with α-1,2-mannosidase II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In previous immunocytochemical studies, we noted that Hsp47 was colocalized with procollagen in what appeared to be pre-Golgi vesicular structures during tooth development(46Shroff B. Smith T. Norris K. Pileggi R. Sauk J.J. Conn. Tissue Res. 1993; 29: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To verify this relationship, cells were treated with GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP that blocks uncoating of both ER and Golgi transport-derived vesicles(47Melancon P. Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Weidman P.J. Serafini T. Gleason M.L. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 48Beckers C.J.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These studies revealed accumulation of transported procollagen and Hsp47 in pre-Golgi intermediate vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell as well as the ER (Fig. 6). Immunoprecipitation of procollagen in GTPγS-treated cells revealed that labeled Hsp47 and CyPB coprecipitated with labeled procollagen (Figure 4:, Figure 5:), in that CyPB trafficking through the secretory pathway can be altered by CsA (27Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mouse 3T6 cells were treated with 1 μM CsA, labeled, and chased as described above for 60 min (Fig. 7). These studies revealed that CsA treatment diminished the levels of CyPB bound to procollagen and delayed the rate of Hsp47 release from procollagen and the rate of procollagen secretion. These data sustain previous studies that revealed that CyPB traverses the secretory pathway rather than acting solely as a proline isomerase functioning within the ER. Albeit CyPB has been shown to act as a PPiase for procollagen(13Steinmann B. Bruckner P. Superti-Furga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1299-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that the release of Hsp47 from procollagen is driven by helix formation, thereby providing one mechanism by which CyPB plays a role in procollagen export and secretion. Although previous studies have demonstrated that Hsp47 and other molecular chaperones remain bound to altered procollagen in α,α-dipyridyl-treated cells and procollagen in some forms of osteogenesis imperfecta(29Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 49Chessler S.D. Beyers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7751-7757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Chessler S.D. Beyers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18226-18233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The studies reported here indicate that Hsp47 association with procollagen is also compartment dependent. In that Hsp47 has been shown not to undergo Golgi processing of its N-linked oligosaccharides, we anticipated that Hsp47 was involved early in procollagen assembly(28Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the association of Hsp47 with procollagen in the intermediate compartment residing between the ER and Golgi suggests a further role for Hsp47 in mediating procollagen export from the ER. This raises questions as to the role of Hsp47 during transport from the ER to the Golgi. Currently, evidence is accruing that suggests that proteins are sorted and concentrated during export from the ER. One paradigm that has been advocated presumes that the protein to be transported is insensitive and relies on the passive movement of exported proteins into designated regions of the ER specialized in export(51Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plunter H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, to ensure net concentration of the protein, it appears that a mechanism must exist to prevent backflow. To account for this, two additional models that hinge on the interaction of the transported protein with transport machinery have been proposed(51Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plunter H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). One of the schemes is analogous to the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis to concentrate-transported protein (52Schmid S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The other suggests that signals also participate in the active recruitment of coat components, leading to the formation of nascent budding sites(40Schwaninger R. Plunter H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 51Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plunter H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 53Balch W.E. Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 157-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In both instances, release from a chaperone-mediated retention system is suggested as the first step in a more regulated pathway involving multiple transport components that initiate, facilitate, or enhance the efficiency of transport(51Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plunter H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We suggest that there is an additional alternative for procollagen. In this system, Hsp47 is seen to possess both chaperone and anti-chaperone properties similar to that recently demonstrated for PDI(54Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, during translation the high levels of Hsp47 function as a chaperones and limit protein aggregation and facilitate chain registration and/or posttranslational modification of procollagen(28Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, as procollagen concentrations increase and are released from GRP78 and GRP94, Hsp47 and/or in consort with CyPB and PDI act as anti-chaperones and provide the basis for the concentration of procollagen destined for export. However, at present it is still not clear whether the Hsp47 and CyPB that escorts procollagen into pre-Golgi intermediate vesicles initiate and/or coordinate the dynamics of coat assembly on the lipid bilayer. It will be important now to examine the transport of procollagen after alteration of Hsp47 and CyPB to define the general need for sorting and concentration and the nature of plausible signals involved in conveyance control from the ER.

https://openalex.org/W1993847641,"Activation of NF-κB by various cellular stimuli involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor, IκBα, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in the regulation of IκBα phosphorylation was investigated. Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations (~1-5 nM) of calyculin A or okadaic acid, potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 (PP-1) and type 2A (PP-2A), induces the phosphorylation of IκBα even in the absence of any cellular stimulus. This action of the phosphatase inhibitors, which is associated with the activation of the RelA·p50 NF-κB heterodimer, is not affected by agents that block the induction of IκBα phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Furthermore, the phosphorylated IκBα from calyculin A-treated cells, but not that from TNF-α-stimulated cells, is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro, suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of IκBα induced by the two different NF-κB inducers. However, induction of IκBα phosphorylation by both TNF-α and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of IκBα. We further demonstrate that TNF-α- and calyculin A-induced IκBα degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of IκBα, mediated through both the TNF-α-inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases, may serve to target IκBα for proteasome-mediated degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2094228209,"Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) has been implicated in cellular events such as mitogenic signaling, actin organization, and receptor sorting. The p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase contains multiple domains capable of protein-protein interactions that may contribute to mediate the multiple physiological functions of this enzyme. Here, we demonstrate that antibodies raised against the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase immunoprecipitate a single tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 120 kDa (pp120) from lysates of activated Jurkat T cells and A20 B cells. This protein is the only significant phosphotyrosine-containing protein in p85 immunoprecipitates from these cells, and it cannot be detected in immunoprecipitates of other signaling proteins such as PLCγ. Furthermore, antibodies specific for the β isoform of p85 but not antibodies specific for the α isoform immunoprecipitate this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. pp120 completely comigrates with the proto-oncogene c-cbl, which is a 120 kDa protein product abundant in lymphoid cells. Furthermore, immunoblots of p85 immunoprecipitates using antibodies raised against c-cbl detect a band at exactly the position of pp120. In addition, p85 can be detected in immunoblots of c-cbl immunoprecipitates. Thus, pp120 appears to correspond to c-cbl. A direct association between c-cbl and p85 can be observed in vitro using a fusion protein comprising the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85, and this binding is abolished by phenyl phosphate, suggesting that the interaction is mediated through phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions. Thus, these results show important functional differences between the α and β isoforms of p85 in vivo and point to c-cbl as a potentially important mediator of some of the functions of PI-3 kinase in intact cells."

Assays with the T. canis recombinant 26-kDa protein expressed as a fusion with maltose-binding protein have confirmed phosphatidylethanolamine-binding specificity for this novel product. Toxocara canis is a parasitic ascarid nematode that infects large numbers of dogs worldwide. Adult worms infest the gut and lay large numbers of eggs that, on excretion, embryonate and lie dormant in the soil. Upon ingestion by non-canid paratenic hosts, tissue-invasive infective stage larvae are released(1Sprent J.F.A. Parasitology. 1958; 48: 184-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In humans these cause visceral and ocular disease syndromes(2Glickman L.T. Schantz P.M. Epidemiol. Rev. 1981; 3: 230-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 3Gillespie S.H. Parasitol.

Infective larvae have been shown to persist up to 9 years(5Beaver P.C. Bull. Soc. Pathol. Exot. 1962; 55: 555-576Google Scholar), demonstrating their remarkable facility for evading host immune responses. T. canis infective larvae are developmentally arrested, and large numbers may easily be cultured in vitro for long periods(6de Savigny D.H. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For this reason this organism has been used as a laboratory model for characterizing the nematode surface in order to understand the mechanisms of escape from immune attack(7Maizels R.M. Gems D.H.

Infective larvae also possess a glycocalyx-like surface coat that overlies the cuticle, comprised largely of a 120-kDa mucin-like glycoprotein, TES-120(15Page A.P. Rudin W. Fluri E. Blaxter M.L.

Monoclonal antibodies reactive to TES-120 bind to secretory glands within the body, from which it is thought that coat components are ducted to the surface via the buccal cavity and secretory pore(18Page A.P. Hamilton A.J. Maizels R.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 75: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). T. canis excretory/secretory product spliced leader polymerase chain reaction maltose-binding protein phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein phosphatidylethanolamine kilobase(s) base pair(s). The mRNA for TES-120 is hyperabundant, representing approximately 10% of a cDNA library, and is trans-spliced with the nematode 22-nucleotide spliced leader (SL) sequence.2 cDNA amplified from mRNA by PCR using SL and oligo(dT) primers reveals the TES-120 hyperabundant band, together with a less abundant mRNA species. We report here the isolation of cDNA corresponding to this second SL-bearing message (TcSL-2), demonstrate its stage-specific expression in infective larvae as the secreted antigen TES-26, and describe the primary structure of the protein. Comparisons to previously known sequences reveal that TcSL-2 belongs to a recently identified family of genes from a range of organisms, some of which bind phosphatidylethanolamine with high specificity. Live adult T. canis were obtained from the intestinal tract from post-mortem dogs. Male worms were snap frozen and stored at −70°C prior to use. Eggs were obtained from uteri excised from gravid females. Hatching of eggs and in vitro culture of infective larvae was as described previously(19Page A.P. Richards D.T. Lewis J.W. Omar H.M. Maizels R.M. Parasitology. 1991; 103: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Approximately 1,000 infective larvae that had been in culture for at least 3 days were suspended in a drop of RPMI 1640 medium and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. This was ground to a fine powder in a pre-cooled mortar with a pestle, and RNA was extracted using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. DNA was prepared from 10 adult males by grinding to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar and resuspending in 5 ml of lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1% SDS and 1 mg/ml proteinase K). This was incubated at 50°C for 3 h with gentle agitation, then extracted with an equal volume of warm phenol (37°C), and spun at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 20°C. After two extractions with phenol/chloroform and one with chloroform, RNase was added to the aqueous phase to a concentration of 250 μg/ml, and the sample was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. After another chloroform extraction DNA was ethanol precipitated from the aqueous phase. Aliquots of 5 μg of T. canis DNA were partially digested using RsaI, HaeIII, and AluI. These were pooled and protected from EcoRI restriction using EcoRI methylase. EcoRI linkers were then ligated on and digested with EcoRI. The inserts were then ligated into the EcoRI site of the expression vector λgt11. After packaging (Amersham packaging extract) a titer of 106 plaque-forming units/ml was obtained, with 98% of clones containing genomic DNA inserts. Anti-TES polyclonal sera were raised in CBA/Ca and BALB/c mice. These sera were found to bind to all components of TES in Western blots. For screening, sera were first preabsorbed against sonicated Escherichia coli and then used at a dilution of 1:25. To prepare cDNA, 1 μl of total RNA solution was used with a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene Ltd., United Kingdom) substituting for Amplitaq in the PCR. RNA PCR has been described previously(21Belyavsky A. Vinogradova T. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2919-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Domec C. Garbay B. Fournier M. Bonnet J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cDNA was amplified at 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 3 min, and 72°C for 15 min for 35 cycles. For first strand cDNA synthesis, primer DGDT containing a 5’ BamHI restriction site (5’-AATTCGGATCCCCCGGG(T)18-3’) was used. Three second primers were added for PCR: DGSL1 (5’-GGGCGGCCGCGGTTCAATTACCCAAGTTGGAG-3’), DGSL2A (5’-GGGCGGCCGCGGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTGGAG-3’), and DGSL3 (5’-GGGCGGCCGCGGGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3’). These primers contained a NotI site positioned so that each primer would result in PCR products being in a different frame relative to the lacZ gene after ligation into the plasmid pBluescript SK(+). Sequence changes were introduced into the SL1 sequence of DGSL1 and DGSL2A to remove termination codons. Total cDNA prepared as described above was used as a template. Two primer pairs were used: DG9a (5’-GCGCGGCGGCCGCGTCAATTAACCTCTGCCAGAAC-3’), containing 21 bases of the sense genomic sequence determined for clone TcG9 and a 5’ NotI site with the oligo(dT) primer DGDT, and DG9c (5’-GCGCGGCGGCCGCGTTCTGGCAGAGGTTAATTGA-3’), containing 21 bases of the antisense TcG9 sequence and a 5’ NotI site with DGSL-2A. Amplification was at 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min for 35 cycles. DNA was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.). DNA probes were labeled with digoxygenin by random priming and detected after hybridization using a digoxygenin DNA Labeling and Detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The chemiluminescent substrate AMPPD was used as a substrate for the anti-digoxygenin hapten-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Hybridization and washing was carried out at high stringency as described in the Boehringer kit protocol. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs were determined using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method with double-stranded DNA (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.01-13.102Google Scholar) using 35S-dATP and a T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The sequences of both strands were determined from two copies of each of the two portions of the TcSL-2 cDNA. Where sequence differences were seen a third copy was sequenced across the region in question. Two expression systems were used to prepare TcSL-2 (TES-26) protein by inserting a PCR-amplified fragment extending from Gln-21 to the C-terminal Ala-263, thereby omitting the putative signal peptide. For pET15b (Novagen), the 5’ primer contained a restriction site for NdeI (AGTGGACATATGCAACAGTGTATGGACAGT), and the 3’ primer contained a BamHI site (TACGGATCCTTAGGCCTGCGATCGATAGAA). Cloning of this insert into a site under control of the T7 promoter was accomplished in E. coli TB-1 cells, which lack the T7 RNA polymerase gene; expression was achieved in BL21 cells carrying the DE3 bacteriophage, which carries T7. The recombinant TcSL-2 was found in the soluble fraction of a bacterial lysate and was purified on a NiSO4-charged chelating Sepharose column by elution at pH 3.8. A second expression system, pMAL (New England BioLabs Inc.) produced a form of TcSL-2, fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP), which performed better in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (see below). For this vector, the same 3’ PCR primer containing a BamHI site was combined with a 5’ primer utilizing a BglI restriction sequence. Western blot analysis was performed on TES antigens as described previously(18Page A.P. Hamilton A.J. Maizels R.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 75: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of TES/track was electrophoresed on a 5-25% polyacrylamide gradient gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose paper, blocked in 5% fetal calf serum, and incubated for 2 h with 1/400 dilution of sera from normal or TES- or TcSL-2-immunized mice. Blots were then probed with 1/2500 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig and finally incubated in substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma). For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, MBP-TES-26 or control MBP from unrecombined pMAL were coated onto plates at 1 μg/ml overnight, and sera were tested at 1/200, incubating for 2 h at 37°C. Wells subsequently received peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG, followed by 2,2’-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.). Absorbances for each serum on MBP and MBP-TES-26 were read at 405 nm, and the net reactivity to TES-26 was calculated by subtraction. A binding assay for phospholipids was adapted from that described for other members of the PEBP family(24Bernier I. Tresca J.P. Jolls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Jones R. Hall L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lipidex-1000 beads (Packard catalog number 6008301) were first washed in 10 volumes of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and then poured into 2-ml columns in siliconized glass. Radiolabeled [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine (DuPont NEN catalog number NEC-783) was mixed with either recombinant 26-kDa MBP fusion protein or MBP alone; all mixtures contained 500 pmol of PE and 0-10 μg of protein in a total volume of 300 μl of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Samples were incubated in siliconized glass for 15 min at 37°C and then cooled on ice before loading onto parallel Lipidex columns. Columns were washed with 5 ml of phosphate buffer, and the flow-through fraction was collected; this fraction contains lipids sequestered by proteins. Free lipids bound to the column were then eluted with 5 ml of methanol at room temperature. Aliquots from each fraction were assayed by liquid scintillation counting, and the proportion of protein-bound PE was calculated as a percentage of total counts recovered. Additional mixtures were set up in which proteins were preincubated with 5 nmol of unlabeled PE or phosphatidylcholine for 15 min at 37°C. Nucleic acid sequences were analyzed using MacMolly (Softgene) and the University of Wisconsin Sequence Analysis (UWGCG) package at the SEQNET facility (Daresbury, UK). Data base searches for amino acid sequence similarities were performed using the Lipman and Pearson algorithm (26Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar) FASTA on the SwissProt data bank, TFASTA on a translated data base of DNA sequences (GenEMBL), and by the BLAST E-mail server (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68338) Google Scholar) to search a collection of data bases including GenBank™, SwissProt, and dbest. cDNA was synthesized from unfractionated RNA prepared from T. canis infective larvae and from adult males. For first strand cDNA synthesis a poly(A)+-complementary primer carrying a 5’ EcoRI restriction enzyme site (DGDT) was used. A second primer containing the conserved nematode 5’ spliced leader (SL1) sequence and a 5’ NotI site was added, and PCR was carried out. It has been demonstrated in the closely related nematode Ascaris lumbricoides that most mRNA species carry a 5’ SL1 sequence(28Nilsen T.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 413-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); the occurrence of spliced leaders in T. canis was previously unknown. The cDNA preparations were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). The cDNA profiles from adult male and infective larvae were similar apart from two distinct bands visible only in infective larval cDNA. The upper band was approximately 1.1 kb in size; analysis of the lower 0.73-kb band is described elsewhere.2 In a parallel experiment, a 1.3-kb genomic λgt11 clone, TcG9, was isolated by immunoreactivity to an anti-TES polyclonal serum raised in mice. To determine if mRNA from this antigen was represented in the SLcDNA, TcG9 was used to probe a Southern blot of adult and infective larva-derived cDNA (Fig. 1B). It was found that hybridization occurred to a single band approximately 1.1 kb in size in the infective larval cDNA. No hybridization to the adult male cDNA was observed. Digoxygenin-labeled TcG9 was hybridized to a Southern blot of T. canis genomic DNA digested with EcoRI at high stringency. A single band of approximately 3 kb was seen (data not shown), indicating the presence of a single copy of the gene. 273 bp of the 5’ end of TcG9 were sequenced, and upstream (DG9a) and downstream (DG9c) primers were designed from the 5’ 21 bp. PCR was carried out on template cDNA from adults or infective larvae. Using infective larval cDNA and DG9a with DGDT, an 850-bp product was obtained (Fig. 2). This was not obtained when adult cDNA was used as a template. The upstream primer (DG9c) was used in PCRs with three SL1-complementary primers. When infective larval cDNA was used as a template, a 235-bp product was obtained in each case (Fig. 2). Where adult cDNA template was used, no such product was seen. Both fragments were ligated into the plasmid pBluescript SK(+). A plasmid containing the 850-bp fragment was digoxygenin-labeled and used to probe TcG9 on a Southern blot, and hybridization occurred (data not shown). These results confirm the correspondence of the cloned 1.1-kb cDNA with the TcG9 genomic sequence and indicate that expression of the gene from which the 1.1-kb mRNA is derived is stage-specific. Using double-stranded sequencing methods two copies of each of the 5’ and 3’ PCR products were sequenced along the full length of both strands (Fig. 3). A group of overlapping clones was assembled of 1,056 bp, including SL1 and excluding the 3’ poly(A)+ tail. The sequence contained a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 263 amino acid residues. The start codon was located 9 bases downstream of the end of the spliced leader sequence. Analysis based on a weight matrix consensus (29von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3684) Google Scholar) indicated that the first 20 residues comprised a signal peptide for targeting secretion. The predicted protein molecular mass was 28,034, but it was 26,007 after removal of the signal peptide with a pI of 8.5 in each case. The most abundant residues in TcSL-2 are alanine (11.0%), asparagine (8.8%), valine (8.8%), threonine (7.6%), and serine (7.2%). A hydropathy plot shows the protein to be largely hydrophilic apart from the N-terminal signal peptide and a 20-amino acid region at residues 94-113 (data not shown). The presence of charged residues on either side of this region suggests that this may be a transmembrane domain, although no direct evidence for membrane association exists for this protein. The N-terminal domain also contains an NPT triplet at amino acids 78-80, but the presence of proline generally prohibits N-glycosylation because the asparagine and hydroxyamino acid side chains cannot be juxtaposed. Recombinant TcSL-2 was expressed as a full-length protein from Gln-21 to the C-terminal Ala-263 in two vectors, pET15b and pMAL. The former was used to prepare recombinant protein for immunization of mice, and sera collected after secondary challenge were used to probe a Western blot of TES antigens. The TcSL-2-specific antiserum reacted with a 26-kDa band distinct from the major TES-32 glycoprotein, which was designated TES-26 (Fig. 4). The 26-kDa antigen showed no shift in mobility when anti-TcSL2/TES-26 was used to probe N-glycanase-treated TES (data not shown). In testing for naturally elicited antibodies in human infection with T. canis, it was found that the pMAL-expressed protein fused to maltose-binding protein performed better than the pET product. Sera from a total of 118 patients with toxocariasis (as confirmed by A >0.5 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on TES) were screened, together with 38 low titer Toxocara-reactive sera and 8 normal controls. Only 18 individuals (11.5%) were seropositive against TES-26, but one normal control was also reactive (data not shown). The relatively low frequency and nonspecific reactivity to TES-26 excludes it from consideration as a diagnostic antigen. The same antibodies have been tested in immunofluorescence assays in which strong staining of the anterior surface of the larvae was observed (data not shown). Because the nematode cuticle and surface coats are extracellular structures, this pattern supports the contention that TES-26 follows a secretory pathway. Seven protein sequences showing a high degree of similarity to the 1.1-kb cDNA were identified by data base searching: the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus Ag16 antigen(30Lobos E. Altmann M. Mengod G. Weiss N. Rudin W. Karam M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 39: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Lobos E. Weiss N. Karam M. Taylor H.R. Ottesen E.A. Nutman T.B.

Genet. 1991; 230: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similarities within this gene family are summarized in Fig. 5. The Ag16 cDNA sequence from O. volvulus(30Lobos E. Altmann M. Mengod G. Weiss N. Rudin W. Karam M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 39: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) shows a frame shift due to a 1-bp deletion relative to the other members of the family at nucleotide 454 (residue 136, Fig. 5). A strong residual similarity can be found between the −1 frame and the rest of the family almost to the end of the protein(37Pikielny C.W. Hasan G. Rouyer F. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 35-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), indicating that this deletion is likely to be a recent event. The sequence alignment reveals several blocks of highly conserved sequence, especially between residues 240 and 253. The run of hydrophobic residues YV(W/F)LVY at 245-250 (Fig. 3) was previously noted as a putative PE-binding sequence (33Schoentgen F. Saccoccio F. Jolls J. Bernier I. Jolls P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and has a similar composition to a known binding site for phosphatidylcholine, VFMYYF (39Akeroyd R. Moonen P. Westerman J. Puyk W.C. Wirtz K.W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In all seven homologues this hydrophobic stretch is bracketed by pairs of charged residues (H,R and E/K/R,Q), possibly reflecting hydrophilic boundaries of a short hydrophobic functional region. Both the 21-kDa bovine protein (33Schoentgen F. Saccoccio F. Jolls J. Bernier I. Jolls P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the 23-kDa rat protein (25Jones R. Hall L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind PE. For this reason the 1.1-kb cDNA putative protein was compared with three other families of lipid-associated proteins: (a) the 14-16-kDa fatty acid-binding proteins, which include surface proteins of Schistosoma mansoni(40Moser D. Tendler M. Griffiths G. Klinkert M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8447-8454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Fasciola hepatica(41Rodriguez-Perez J. Rodriguez-Medina J.R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Hillyer G.V. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); (b) the mammalian lipid-binding proteins, e.g. human adipocyte lipid-binding protein (42Baxa C.A. Sha R.S. Buelt M.K. Smith A.J. Matarese V. Chinander L.L. Boundy K.L. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8683-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and rat nonspecific lipid transfer protein(43Mori T. Tsukamoto T. Mori H. Tashiro Y. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4338-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); and (c) the plant phospholipid transfer proteins, e.g. barley phospholipid transfer protein(44Linnestad C. Loenneborg A. Kalla R. Olsen O.A. Plant Physiology. 1991; 97: 841-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No significant similarity was detected between the PEBP family and the other three lipid associated protein families (data not shown). A short stretch of similarity (7 out of 8 residues identical) was also found between residues 54-61 of TcSL-2 and residues 107-114 of von Willebrand's factor(45Sadler J.E. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Harlan J.M. Titani K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), a mammalian serum protein involved in platelet adhesion and blood coagulation (Fig. 5). To test whether the sequence homology reflected a functional conservation, recombinant TES-26, expressed as a fusion protein with MBP, was tested in a Lipidex bead assay for binding to radioactive PE. These beads bind free lipid but not lipid sequestered by proteins, and this assay has demonstrated PE binding by other TES-26 homologues(24Bernier I. Tresca J.P. Jolls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Jones R. Hall L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that TES-26 but not MBP binds directly to labeled PE. This binding can be largely inhibited by a 10-fold molar excess of cold PE but not by phosphatidylcholine. Amino acid residues 23-94 comprise partial repeats of a cysteine-rich 36-residue consensus sequence, designated the NC6 motif (Fig. 7). This contains the consensus sequence XCXDXAX2CX6CX11RCX2TCX2C previously identified at the C terminus of another major secreted glycoprotein of T. canis infective larvae, TES-120, and this motif is also found in several predicted genes from Caenorhabditis elegans.2 Although the 5’ and 3’ NC6 motifs of TES-26 are homologous, there is a greater similarity between these sequences and the corresponding motifs in TES-120, indicating that the duplication to create a 72-amino acid domain was an ancient event (Fig. 7). A cDNA library prepared from T. canis infective larvae (kindly provided by C. Tripp and R. B. Grieve, Paravax Inc., Fort Collins, CO) was screened with the 850-bp fragment of the 1.1-kb cDNA at high stringency. Hybridization occurred to 0.8-1.9% of plaques (sample size, 1,387), showing that this transcript is highly abundant in infective larvae. We describe here a cDNA clone that represents an abundantly expressed and stage-specific mRNA and a corresponding excretory/secretory protein in infective larvae of the parasitic nematode T. canis. Sequence similarity analyses show that TcSL-2 (TES-26) belongs to a recently defined gene family of PEBPs. Moreover, TES-26 retains a hydrophobic motif thought in mammalian homologues to mediate lipid binding. Consistent with these indications of its function, we have also shown direct PE binding by TES-26, and we have preliminary evidence for an extracellular (surface) association of this molecule. It is interesting to note that a homologous protein is also associated with the surface (cuticle) of O. volvulus adult worms(30Lobos E. Altmann M. Mengod G. Weiss N. Rudin W. Karam M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 39: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which, like larval T. canis, are tissue-dwelling parasites. Despite the similarities within the PEBP gene families, TES-26 has numerous distinct features. The most extensive is that TES-26 alone possesses paired NC6 motifs, suggesting that it is a hybrid gene composed of domains of diverse ancestry. The presence of similar paired NC6 sequences on two proteins secreted by infective larvae suggests that this motif may be associated with some surface-related function, possibly involving modulation of host immunity. However, the presence of related sequences in the free-living nematode C. elegans indicates a more fundamental role in the biology of the organism. TES-26 differs in other important respects. It possesses a 20-residue hydrophobic domain that separates the NC6 motifs from the PEBP homology region and that could permit membrane association. In other family members, the corresponding sequences contain numerous charged residues and are unlikely to fufill this function. All non-nematode homologues lack signal peptides and are cellular proteins, although the murine PEBP has been shown to be secreted, being highly abundant in epididymal fluid(25Jones R. Hall L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because nematode cuticles are extracellular structures (46Maizels R.M. Blaxter M.L. Selkirk M.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the acquisition of signal peptide sequences may serve both to direct the PEBP to a surface location and to allow its secretion into the environment of the parasite. A role for this protein in the uptake and transport of host lipids is possible because parasitic helminths generally have limited ability to synthesize long chain fatty acids and cholesterols de novo. For example, the trematodes F. hepatica and S. mansoni express surface fatty acid-binding proteins(40Moser D. Tendler M. Griffiths G. Klinkert M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8447-8454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rodriguez-Perez J. Rodriguez-Medina J.R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Hillyer G.V. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which sequester fatty acids from host serum and incorporate them into the tegument. However, we found no sequence similarity between TES-26 and proteins known to be involved in lipid transport. A second possibility, arising from the preferential location of PE on the cytoplasmic leaflet of plasma membranes, is that a PEBP could asymmetrically associate with membrane-bound proteins(25Jones R. Hall L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, PEBPs may be involved in the segregation of lipids into biologically distinct compartments(35Perry A.C.F. Hall L. Bell A.E. Jones R. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This last possibility is intriguing in the light of strong experimental evidence that the surface of T. canis larvae is made up of nondiffusing, discontinuous lipid domains(17Kennedy M.W. Proudfoot L. Lewis J. Maizels R.M. Toxocara canis: Clinical, Epidemiological and Molecular Perspectives. Institute of Biology, London1993: 151-161Google Scholar, 47Kennedy M.W. Foley M. Kuo Y.-M. Kusel J.R. Garland P.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We are now studying each of these possibilities to establish the precise function of the nematode PEBPs and to understand why T. canis should produce this protein in such quantity. The extraordinarily high expression of TES-120, the surface coat mucin, and the major antigen targetted by the host response can be related to the high turnover of the coat as a mechanism of immune evasion by this parasite. Unlike TES-120, for which the mRNA is hyperabundant, the level of expression of TES-26 appears low relative to its specific message. Moreover, the lack of antibodies in human infection sera was unexpected, especially because the gene was originally selected for reactivity with antisera from TES-immunized mice. It is conceivable that TES-26 is invisible to the human immune system in the context of an active Toxocara infection and that a lack of response to this antigen could even be a prerequisite for establishment. Future studies will therefore aim to assess TES-26 both as a physiological requirement for parasite survival and as a potential target to induce immunological protection against infection. These questions are made especially important by the remarkable ability of T. canis to live for many years in a wide range of mammalian species."

We have analyzed the reaction mechanism of the enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. YL and found that Asp10 is the active site nucleophile. When the multiple turnover enzyme reaction was carried out in H218O with L-2-chloropropionate as a substrate, lactate produced was labeled with 18O. However, when the single turnover enzyme reaction was carried out by use of a large excess of the enzyme, the product was not labeled. This suggests that an oxygen atom of the solvent water is first incorporated into the enzyme and then transferred to the product. After the multiple turnover reaction in H218O, the enzyme was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the molecular masses of the peptide fragments formed were measured by an ionspray mass spectrometer. Two 18O atoms were shown to be incorporated into a hexapeptide, Gly6-Lys11. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of this peptide revealed that Asp10 was labeled with two 18O atoms. Our previous site-directed mutagenesis experiment showed that the replacement of Asp10 led to a significant loss in the enzyme activity. These results indicate that Asp10 acts as a nucleophile on the α-carbon of the substrate leading to the formation of an ester intermediate, which is hydrolyzed by nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the carbonyl carbon atom.

They have several common properties; their molecular weights are between 25,000 and 28,000, they show the maximum reactivities in the pH range of 9-11, they specifically act on the L isomer of a substrate, their substrates contain a carboxylate group, and the halogen atom to be released is bound to the α-carbon of the substrate.We have isolated and purified thermostable L-2-haloacid dehalogenase (L-DEX YL) from a 2-chloroacrylate-utilizable bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. YL(6Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Hasan A.K.M.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hasan A.K.M.Q. Takada H. Koshikawa H.

Okamura T. Esaki N. Soda K. Biodegradation. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of 232 amino acid residues(8Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu J.-Q. Koshikawa H. Ozaki H. Terashima Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its amino acid sequence is highly similar to those of L-DEXs from other bacterial strains and haloacetate dehalogenase H-2 from Moraxella sp. strain B; 36-70% of residues are identical(5Jones D.H.A.

Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these dehalogenase reactions probably proceed through the same mechanism.Two different mechanisms have been proposed for the reactions of L-DEXs (Fig. 1)(14Kawasaki H. Tsuda K. Matsushita I. Tonomura K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). According to the mechanism shown in Fig. 1A, a carboxylate group of Asp or Glu acts as a nucleophile to attack the α-carbon of L-2-haloacid, leading to the formation of an ester intermediate. This is hydrolyzed by an attack of the water molecule activated by a basic amino acid residue of the enzyme. Alternatively, water is activated by a catalytic base of the enzyme and directly attacks the α-carbon of L-2-haloacid to displace the halogen atom (Fig. 1B). In both mechanisms, a positively charged amino acid residue is suggested to bind the carboxylate group of the substrate.Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been extensively carried out to elucidate the catalytic amino acid residues of L-DEX(15Asmara W. Murdiyatmo U. Baines A.J. Bull A.T. Hardman D.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Schneider B. Muller R. Frank R. Lingens F. Biol. Chem.

Biochem. 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). His20 of L-DEX from Pseudomonas cepacia MBA4 was proposed to act as a catalytic base as shown in Fig. 1B(15Asmara W. Murdiyatmo U. Baines A.J. Bull A.T. Hardman D.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, replacement of His19 of L-DEX YL, corresponding to His20 of the P. cepacia enzyme, by a few other residues caused no inactivation of the enzyme, indicating that this His is not involved in catalysis(17Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We mutated all the 36 highly conserved charged and polar amino acid residues of L-DEX YL and found that the enzyme activity is decreased significantly by replacement of Asp10, Asp180, Lys151, Ser175, Arg41, Thr14, Tyr157, and Asn177(18Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, we could not show which mechanism of those shown in Fig. 1 is involved in the reaction and identify the catalytic residue.We conducted single and multiple turnover enzyme reactions in H218O in the present study. The single turnover reaction was carried out in the solution containing the enzyme in excess of substrate, whereas the multiple turnover reaction was done by using an excess amount of substrate. If the reaction proceeds through the Fig. 1B mechanism, 18O is incorporated into the product both in single and in multiple turnover reactions. In the case of the reaction through the Fig. 1A mechanism, the single turnover reaction causes 18O incorporation into the carboxylate group of the enzyme but not into the product. In the multiple turnover reaction, both the product and the carboxylate group of the catalytic residue are labeled with 18O. We show in this paper that the reaction proceeds through the Fig. 1A mechanism and that Asp10 acts as a catalytic nucleophile.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialspBA5 encoding L-DEX YL was constructed as described in the previous paper(8Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu J.-Q. Koshikawa H. Ozaki H. Terashima Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.5-kilobase pair PstI-BamHI fragment of pBA5 containing the 3ʹ-noncoding region was removed, and the remaining 3.6-kilobase pair fragment was circularized to form pBA501. Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 mutS, E. coli BW313, and helper phage M13K07 were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Shuzo or Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Lysyl endopeptidase of Achromobacter lyticus M497-1 was purchased from Wako Industry Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M was from Tosoh (Tokyo, Japan). L-2-Chloropropionate was purchased from Sigma. H218O (95-98%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) and Nippon Sanso (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Introduction of Lysyl Residues into L-DEX YL to Be Digested by Lysyl EndopeptidaseLysyl residues were introduced into the enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis in order to produce lysyl endopeptidase hydrolytic sites. The template single-stranded DNA was prepared by infecting recombinant E. coli BW313 carrying plasmid pBA501 with M13K07 phage under the conditions specified by the manufacturer. Replacement of Leu11, Ser176, and Arg185 by Lys was carried out by the method of Kunkel(19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes and synthetic mutagenic primers are as follows (the underlines indicate the mutagenized nucleotides): L11K, 5ʹ-ACAGCGTACCGTACTTGTCGAAGGCAATACC-3ʹ; S176K, 5ʹ-GCGTTCTTCGACACGAACAGG-3ʹ; R185K, 5ʹ-GAAGCCGAAGTATTTCGCCCCCG-3ʹ. The substitutions were confirmed by DNA sequencing with Dye Terminator sequencing kit and an Applied Biosystem 370A DNA sequencer. The constructed triple mutant named L-DEX T15 was produced by E. coli BMH 71-18 mutS.Cultivation of the Cells and Purification of the EnzymeRecombinant E. coli cells were cultivated at 37°C for 14-18 h in Luria-Bertani medium (1% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 150 μg/ml of ampicillin and 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside.The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and disrupted by ultrasonic oscillation at 4°C for 20 min with a Seiko Instruments model 7500 ultrasonic disintegrator. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was brought to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was dialyzed against 2000 volumes of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 14 h and subsequently applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column. The elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 50-300 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The active fractions were pooled and used as the purified enzyme.Enzyme and Protein AssayL-DEX was assayed with 25 mML-2-chloropropionate as a substrate. The chloride ions released were measured spectrophotometrically according to the method of Iwasaki et al.(20Iwasaki I. Utsumi S. Hagino K. Ozawa T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1956; 29: 860-864Crossref Google Scholar). One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the dehalogenation of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Protein assay was done with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.Single and Multiple Turnover Reactions of Wild-type L-DEX YL in H218OFor a typical single turnover experiment, 200 nmol of the wild-type L-DEX YL in 50 μl of 50 mM Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.5) was lyophilized. The reaction was initiated by dissolving the dried enzyme in 50 μl of H218O containing 20 nmol of L-2-chloropropionate, and the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 24 h. For a multiple turnover experiment, 10 nmol of L-DEX, 1 μmol of L-2-chloropropionate, and 2.5 μmol of Tris-H2SO4 (pH 9.0) previously lyophilized were mixed in 50 μl of H218O and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The reaction mixtures were ultrafiltrated, diluted 10-fold with 50% acetonitrile/H2O (1:1), and then introduced into the mass spectrometer by using a Harvard Apparatus syringe infusion pump operating at 2 μl/min. The molecular mass of the produced lactate was measured with a PE-Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ionspray ion source in the negative ion mode (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada).Single and Multiple Turnover Reactions of 18O-Labeled Wild-type L-DEX YL in H2OWild-type L-DEX YL was labeled with 18O under the same conditions as the multiple turnover reaction in H218O by adjusting the molar ratio of enzyme and substrate to 1:100. The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.5), and the recovered enzyme was used as the 18O-labeled enzyme to catalyze single and multiple turnover reactions in H2O according to the same procedures as described above.Digestion of 18O-Labeled L-DEX T15 with Lysyl Endopeptidase10 nmol of lyophilized L-DEX T15, 1 μmol of L-2-chloropropionate, and 2.5 μmol of Tris-H2SO4 (pH 9.0) were mixed in 50 μl of H218O and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The protein was denatured with 8 M urea and subsequently digested at 37°C for 12 h with 80-100 pmol of lysyl endopeptidase. L-DEX T15 incubated in H218O without substrate was used as a control.LC/MS Analysis of the Proteolytic DigestThe proteolytic digest was loaded onto a packed capillary perfusion column (Poros II R/H, 320 μm × 10 cm LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) connected to the mass spectrometer and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The total ion current chromatogram was recorded in the single quadrupole mode with a PE-Sciex API III mass spectrometer equipped with an ionspray ion source. The quadrupole was scanned from 300 to 2000 atomic mass units with a step size of 0.25 atomic mass units and a 0.5-ms dwell time per step. Ion spray voltage was set at 5 kV, and the orifice potential was 80 V. The molecular mass of each peptide was calculated with MacSpec software supplied by Sciex.For detailed analysis of the peptides containing Asp10 and Asp180, the proteolytic digest of the enzyme incubated in H218O with or without a substrate was applied to a C18 column (Puresil 5 μ C18 120Å, 4.6 × 150 mm; Millipore, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min followed by a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 215 nm with a UV detector, and the fractions were collected and injected into a PE-Sciex API III mass spectrometer in the single quadrupole mode under the same conditions as described above.Identification of the Active Site Peptide by Tandem MS/MS SpectrometryThe MS/MS daughter ion spectra were obtained in the triple quadrupole daughter scan mode by selectively introducing the peptides containing Asp10 (m/z 654.5 or m/z 650.2) from Q1 into the collision cell (Q2) and observing the daughter ions in Q3. Q1 was locked on m/z 654.5 or 650.2. Q3 was scanned from 50 to just above the molecular weight of the peptide. Step size was 0.1, and dwell time was 1 ms/step. Ion spray voltage was set at 5 kV, and the orifice potential was 100 V. Collision energy was 30 eV. The resolution of Q1 and Q3 was approximately 500 and 1500, respectively. The collision gas was argon, and the gas thickness was 2.9 × 1014 molecules/cm2.Amino Acid SequencingThe amino acid sequences of peptides were determined with a fully automated protein sequencer PPSQ-10 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).RESULTSSingle and Multiple Turnover Reactions of Wild-type L-DEX YL in H218OUnder the single turnover conditions, less than 10% D-lactate produced in H218O contained 18O (Fig. 2A), whereas under the multiple turnover conditions, more than 95% D-lactate contained 18O (Fig. 2B). These suggest that an oxygen atom of water molecule is first transferred to the enzyme and then to the product. This supports the mechanism involving an ester intermediate shown in Fig. 1A, but does not the Fig. 1B mechanism, in which an oxygen atom of solvent water is directly transferred to the product.Figure 2:Ion spray mass spectra of lactate produced with wild-type L-DEX in H218O. The spectra were obtained between 85 and 95 atomic mass units. Step size was 0.1 atomic mass unit, and dwell time was 10 ms/step. Ion spray voltage was set at −3.5 kV, and the orifice potential was −50 V. A, single turnover reaction.

The enzyme was not inactivated at all by this procedure. Single and multiple turnover reactions were carried out in H2O with 18O-labeled L-DEX YL. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Under the single turnover conditions (Fig. 3A), more than 90% D-lactate produced contained 18O. But under the multiple turnover conditions, 18O-labeled D-lactate was no more than 5% (Fig. 3B). These results also suggest that an oxygen atom of solvent water is first incorporated into the enzyme, and then transferred to the product.Figure 3:Ion spray mass spectra of lactate produced with 18O-labeled L-DEX in normal H2O.

The substitutions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant enzyme was purified to homogenity by DEAE-Toyopearl column chromatography. Properties of the mutant L-DEX T15 such as specific activity toward L-2-chloropropionate and optimum pH were identical to those of the wild-type enzyme.LC/MS Analysis of the Peptides Proteolytically FormedL-DEX T15 was used to carry out a multiple turnover reaction in H218O with L-2-chloropropionate as a substrate. After completion of the reaction, the enzyme was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the resulting peptide fragments were separated on a capillary column interfaced with an ionspray mass spectrometer as a detector. When the spectrometer was in the single quadrupole mode, the total ion current chromatogram displayed several peaks (Fig. 4). Peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were assigned to peptides 109-113, 177-185, 1-5, 6-11, 114-176, and (12-108 + 186-228), respectively (Table 1). Peptides 12-108 and 186-228 are supposed to be bound to each other by a disulfide bond, though this bond could form artificially because the proteolysis was carried out under the aerobic condition. The molecular mass of peptide 6-11 was 654.5 Da, which is approximately 4 Da higher than the predicted molecular mass (650.75 Da), although the amino acid sequence of this peptide was Gly-Ile-Ala-Phe-Asp-Lys, which is identical to that predicted from the nucleotide sequence. Molecular masses of all other peptides were indistinguishable from the predicted ones. These results indicate that two 18O atoms were incorporated solely into the peptide 6-11, which contains Asp10.Figure 4:Total ion current chromatogram of proteolytic fragments of 18O-labeled L-DEX.

The enzyme was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the peptides 6-11 and 177-185 containing Asp10 and Asp180, respectively, were isolated with a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography column. Two atoms of 18O were incorporated into the peptide 6-11 when L-DEX T15 was incubated in H218O in the presence of L-2-chloropropionate (Fig. 5B). However, 18O was not incorporated when the enzyme was incubated in the absence of L-2-chloropropionate (Fig. 5A). No 18O incorporation was observed for the peptide 177-185, whether L-DEX T15 was incubated in the presence or absence of L-2-chloropropionate (Fig. 5, C and D).Figure 5:Ion spray mass spectra of the peptides containing Asp10 and Asp180.

The parent ions of m/z 654.5 and m/z 650.2, corresponding to 18O-labeled and unlabeled hexapeptides, respectively, were selected in the first quadrupole and subjected to collision-induced fragmentation in a collision cell in the second quadrupole. The daughter ions produced are shown in Fig. 6. The Yʹ series ions at m/z 484.0, 413.1, and 266.0 of 18O-labeled peptide correspond to the fragments of Ala-Phe-Asp-Lys, Phe-Asp-Lys, and Asp-Lys, respectively. They are about 4 Da higher than those of ions at m/z 480.3, 409.1, and 262.0 of the unlabeled peptide. However, after the deletion of Asp, molecular masses of the remaining portions (Lys) of these two peptides were closely similar to each other (146.8). These results suggest that two atoms of 18O of solvent water are incorporated into Asp10 of the enzyme during the dehalogenation reaction.Figure 6:Tandem MS/MS daughter ion spectra of 18O-labeled and unlabeled active site peptides (Gly6-Lys11).

This observation is not consistent with the general base mechanism shown in Fig. 1B but rather with the Fig. 1A mechanism, where an active site carboxylate functions as a nucleophile, and an ester intermediate is produced.Asp10 and Asp180 were shown to be important for catalysis by our site-directed mutagenesis experiments(18Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried to find which residue acts as a nucleophile shown in Fig. 1A. The nucleophilic residue is expected to be labeled with 18O when the reaction is carried out in H218O. LC/MS and tandem MS/MS analysis showed that an oxygen atom of solvent water was incorporated into the carboxylate group of Asp10, but not into Asp180. Accordingly, the dehalogenation reaction of L-DEX probably proceeds through the ester intermediate mechanism in which Asp10 functions as a nucleophile (Fig. 1A). Since two 18O atoms were incorporated into Asp10, both oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group of Asp10 are equivalent and either can attack the substrate.Recent computer analysis revealed that L-DEX belongs to a large superfamily of hydrolases with diverse specificity (21Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These proteins include different types of phosphatases and numerous uncharacterized proteins from eubacteria, eukaryotes, and Archaea. Among all of these proteins, Asp10 is completely conserved. This suggests the essential role of Asp10 and supports our above conclusion.The same reaction mechanism in which a nucleophilic carboxylate group takes part has been proposed for three types of hydrolases: rat liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase(22Lacourciere G.M. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 10466-10467Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10(23Pries F. Kingma J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1242-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and (4-chlorobenzoyl)coenzyme A dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3(24Yang G. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Epoxide hydrolase and haloalkane dehalogenase are structurally related to each other, but (4-chlorobenzoyl)coenzyme A dehalogenase does not share sequence identity with either of these two enzymes. L-DEX does not show a significant sequence similarity to any of these three enzymes. Hence, L-DEX resembles these hydrolases solely by the presence of an active site nucleophilic carboxylate.In conclusion, Asp10 of L-DEX probably acts as a nucleophile to attack the α-carbon of the substrate to form an ester intermediate, which is hydrolyzed by attack of an activated water molecule (Fig. 7). This is the first evidence for the catalytic action of Asp10 in the L-DEX reaction. The combination of 18O incorporation experiment and tandem mass spectrometrical analysis of the labeled enzyme is an effective approach to the catalytic mechanism of the member of the hydrolase superfamily.Figure 7:Probable reaction mechanism of L-DEX.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) INTRODUCTIONL-2-Haloacid dehalogenase (L-DEX) ( 1The abbreviations used are: L-DEXL-2-haloacid dehalogenaseL-DEX YLthermostable L-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp.

This antimitogenic effect of TNF-α was accompanied by a decreased number of cells in S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Based on growth arrest experiments using aphidicolin, it is apparent that TNF-α acted in early G1 phase. It did not show antimitogenic effects once cells reentered the S phase based on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and cell cycle analysis. Specificity of TNF-α was established by using monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody. On the basis of Western immunoblot analysis of Rb, p53 and cell cycle inhibitory protein (Cip1) (p21) proteins, TNF-α decreased Rb protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner whereas it increased the expression level of tumor suppressor p53 protein. TNF-α also increased the expression level of Cip1 (p21) protein in a dose-dependent manner. This induction of Cip1 (p21) protein was preceded by the induction of p53 protein in MCF-7 cells. Cip1 (p21) protein associated with cyclin D was also increased. Tumor suppressor Rb protein expression was increased during G1 to S phase progression. Cyclin D protein expression levels were not changed in response to TNF-α treatment, although serine/threonine kinase inhibitors such as H7 and the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine decreased cyclin D expression levels in MCF-7 cells. Based on experiments with staurosporine, it appears that TNF-α does not utilize a protein kinase C pathway in MCF-7 cells.

TNF-α did not affect complexes between cyclin D and Cdk2, Cdk4, and Rb proteins in MCF-7 cells.

This phosphorylation of Rb protein is believed to be achieved by physical association of these proteins and cyclins.Tumor suppressor cell cycle inhibitory protein (Cip1) (p21) was found to be a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases(50Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Didransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). It is known to be associated with various cyclin-Cdk complexes. The main role of Cip1 (p21) protein is to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Cip1 (p21) protein is known to be induced in mammalian cells undergoing G1 arrest or apoptosis(51El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). G1 arrest is linked to p53 gene induction, and it is believed that induction of p53 in turn induces expression of Cip1 (p21) protein. The fact that oncogenes such as SV40 T antigen inhibits induction of Cip1 (p21) protein suggests that Cip1 (p21) protein might act as an anti-oncogene.We investigated the antimitogenic effects of TNF-α in MCF-7 cells as determined by expression levels of cell cycle-related proteins such as Rb, Cip1 (p21), p53, and cyclins to extend our understanding of the mechanisms of TNF-α action in MCF-7 cells. We found by cell cycle analysis that TNF-α acted during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This was associated with a decrease in the expression of Rb and increased expressions of Cip1 (p21) and p53. There was no effect on cyclin D1, Cdk2, or Cdk4 proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and ReagentsMCF-7 (estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer) cells were cultured in a humidified air atmosphere (5% CO2) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS.

Polyclonal antibodies to human Cdc2, Cdk2, Cdk4, and cyclin D were also purchased from UBI. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human Cip1 (p21) Ab was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-human Rb antibody was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Aphidicolin and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma and RNase A (Bovine) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) kit was purchased from Amersham Corp. [3H]Thymidine was purchased from DuPont NEN. H7 and H8 were purchased from Sigma. Staurosporine was purchased from UBI.[3H]Thymidine Incorporation AssayMCF-7 cells (2 × 104/well) were incubated with TNF-α for various time intervals. [3H]Thymidine (20 μCi/ml) was added to each well for 1 h, washed with 1 × HBSS (Hanks' buffered salt solution) three times, and cell lysates were prepared with 0.5% (w/v) SDS solution. To the latter was added 20% trichloroacetic acid (v/v) solution and incubation continued for 30 min on ice. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples were washed with 20% trichloroacetic acid (v/v), 10% trichloroacetic acid (v/v), and 90% ethanol (v/v) successively, and filters were dried. Radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. [3H]Thymidine incorporation data were normalized with cell counts and protein concentration of each sample.Cell Cycle AnalysisMCF-7 cells treated with various concentrations of TNF-α were trypsinized. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS buffer, and were fixed by HBSS buffer containing 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in HBSS buffer containing 50 μg/ml RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Incubation continued for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were filtered through nylon mesh (41 μm) and DNA content was measured in an Epics II flow cytometer. Propidium iodide staining does not distinguish G0 cells from G1.Western Blot AnalysisCell lysates were prepared from MCF-7 cells treated with TNF-α by extraction buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a microcentrifuge and were loaded for SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose filters by electroblot transfer for 2 h at 200 mA. The nitrocellulose filter was incubated with blocking buffer (1 × TBS (Tris-buffered saline), Fraction V 3% BSA (w/v), 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and washed with 1 × TBS buffer for 20 min. The nitrocellulose filter was incubated with primary antibody and dissolved in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C (anti-human Rb Ab was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml). On the following day the nitrocellulose filter was washed with 1 × TBS for 20 min and incubated with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated with IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody was at a concentration of 1:1000 dilution. After washing with 1 × TBS for 20 min at room temperature, detection of proteins of interest was carried out by the ECL method.For immunoprecipitation, confluent MCF-7 cells (106/100-mm dish) were lysed and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-human cyclin D Ab conjugated with protein A-Sepharose. Reaction was carried out at 4°C for 4 h on a rotary shaker. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, and 2 × sample buffer was added to the beads. Boiled samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE. Western immunoblot analyses were followed according to standard procedures.RESULTSAntimitogenicity of TNF-α in MCF-7 CellsTo determine whether TNF-α has antimitogenic effects on MCF-7 cells, various concentrations of TNF-α were added to MCF-7 cells for 24 h at 37°C and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was carried out. The antimitogenic effect of TNF-α was dose-related as shown in Fig. 1. TNF-α did not show any effect at low concentrations but showed clear antimitogenic effects at concentrations exceeding 0.5 ng/ml. TNF-α did not show mitogenic activity at any concentration. The antimitogenic effect was also seen in MCF-7 cells grown under SFM conditions, suggesting that the antimitogenic effect is due not to serum factors but to direct antimitogenic effects of TNF-α on MCF-7 cells. To determine the specificity of TNF-α, a blocking experiment using monoclonal anti-human TNF-α Ab was carried out. Briefly, TNF-α (10 ng/ml) was preincubated with various concentrations of monoclonal anti-human TNF-α Ab at 37°C for 1 h before addition to each well. The next day [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was carried out. As shown in Table 1, the antimitogenic effect of TNF-α was efficiently blocked by an excess concentration of monoclonal anti-human TNF-α Ab while antibody itself did not show any effect on MCF-7 cell growth. Table 2 shows that this inhibition of TNF-α action is consistent with the cell cycle analysis of MCF-7 cells treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) alone or in combination with anti-TNF-α Ab (500 ng/ml).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine whether antimitogenicity of TNF-α is cell cycle-related, FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) analysis was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2A, TNF-α changed the percentage of cells in S phase. The decrease in the fraction of cells in S phase was dose-dependent, as evidenced by larger changes in response to higher concentrations of TNF-α. Changes in cell cycle phases were also time-dependent (data not shown). These results suggest that TNF-α might prevent cells from entering S phase. Based on these results, it is likely that TNF-α acts at the G1/S phase boundary. To prove this point, MCF-7 cells were growth-arrested at the G1/S boundary by aphidicolin treatment (5 μg/ml) for 24 h, washed with 1 × HBSS buffer, and refed with 10% FCS/DMEM. At each interval after release from aphidicolin growth arrest, TNF-α (10 ng/ml) was added. MCF-7 cells were harvested for cell cycle analysis, and cell lysates for [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. As shown in Fig. 2B, TNF-α added at 0, 3, 6, and 12 h after release from aphidicolin treatment showed antimitogenic effects, but not at 20 h. This result suggests that TNF-α acts in the G1 phase but not after cells reenter the S phase. This suggests that TNF-α does not offset the mitogenic stimulation of serum. The antimitogenic effect of TNF-α was more apparent in a synchronized population of MCF-7 cells. To determine whether the blocking effect of TNF-α by antibody is also accompanied by changes in cell cycle phases, growth arrest experiments using aphidicolin were carried out as before. As shown in Table 1, monoclonal anti-human TNF-α Ab itself did not affect cellular growth, suggesting that endogenous TNF-α did not play a role in MCF-7 cell growth. TNF-α added at 0, 3, 6, and 10 h but not 20 h showed antimitogenic effects. When TNF-α was added along with monoclonal TNF-α Ab, the latter efficiently inhibited the antimitogenic effect of TNF-α.Figure 2:A, temporal profile of TNF-α action in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells (106 cells/100-mm dish) were treated with various concentrations of TNF-α for 16 h. Cell cycle analysis was carried out according to standard procedures. Columns a-f refer to observations made at different concentrations of TNF-α of 0, 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 ng/ml. B, temporal profile of TNF-α action in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were growth-arrested by aphidicolin treatment (5 μg/ml) for 24 h, washed with 1 × HBSS buffer extensively, and refed with 10% FCS/DMEM. TNF-α (10 ng/ml) was added at the indicated times. FACS analysis was carried out according to standard procedures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of TNF-α on Cell Cycle-related ProteinsBased on the previous results of the antimitogenic effects of TNF-α, it was necessary to determine whether TNF-α affects expression levels of cell cycle-regulated proteins. For this purpose, Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-human Rb Ab was carried out. MCF-7 cells were treated with aphidicolin for 16 h, washed with 1 × HBSS buffer, and incubated with 10% FCS/DMEM. TNF-α (10 ng/ml) was added at each time point, and cell lysates were prepared according to standard procedures. As shown in Fig. 3, TNF-α added at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 20 h after release showed decreased expression levels of Rb proteins. This result suggests that the decreased DNA synthesis seen in Fig. 1 is consistent with decreased expression levels of Rb protein in response to TNF-α. This result also suggests that Rb protein is important for G1/S transition in the cell cycle. Based on these results, it is plausible that TNF-α acts, in part, by decreasing Rb tumor suppressor protein in MCF-7 cells.Figure 3:TNF-α acts at G1 phase to decrease Rb expression. Normally growing MCF-7 cells (106/100-mm dish) were growth-arrested by incubation with aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) for 16 h, washed with 1 × HBSS buffer three times, and refed with 10% FCS/DMEM. TNF-α was subsequently added at the indicated times after aphidicolin release and harvesting at 24 h. Thus cells were exposed to TNF-α for 24, 21, 18, 12, and 4 h, respectively. Western blot using monoclonal anti-human Rb Ab (1 μg/ml) was carried out according to standard procedures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF-β, a well known antimitogenic agent in many other mammalian cells, did not manifest any antimitogenic activity or induce decreased Rb protein levels in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that TNF-α activity is not mediated by TGF-β, as was the case with interferon-α in human Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cells(32Kumar R. Atlas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6599-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). G1 cyclins such as cyclin D did not show any change in expression levels in response to TNF α in MCF-7 cells. Cdk4 protein did not respond to TNF-α under these conditions. To determine whether cyclin D protein reflects the growth state of the MCF-7 cells, normally proliferating MCF-7 cells were treated with TNF-α (10 and 25 ng/ml), Bt2cAMP (1 mM), or staurosporine (1 nM) for 24 h and Western immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti-human cyclin D Ab (1 μg/ml) was employed. As seen in Fig. 4, there was no significant reduction in the expression level of cyclin D in response to TNF-α. However, in response to H7 as well as staurosporine, cyclin D expression levels were significantly reduced. H7 and staurosporine were found to be strong antimitogenic agents in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Cdk4 protein levels remained constant regardless of the treatments.Figure 4:Growth-regulated expression of cyclin D1 in MCF-7 cells. Normally proliferating MCF-7 cells (106/100-mm dish) were treated with various concentrations of TNF-α (10, 25 ng/ml), Bt2cAMP (1 mM), and staurosporine (1 nM) for 24 h, and cell lysates were prepared for Western immunoblot analysis. Polyclonal anti-human cyclin D Ab was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5 shows that TNF-α-mediated regulation of Rb protein expression is specific in nature, as preincubation of TNF-α with monoclonal anti-human TNF-α Ab prevented TNF-α antimitogenicity in MCF-7 cells (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). This result suggests that endogenous TNF-α does not regulate Rb protein expression. This figure also shows that TNF-α did not have an effect on Rb protein expression once cells enter S phase (lane 13), suggesting an important role of Rb protein in G1/S transition in the cell cycle of MCF-7 cells.Figure 5:Specificity of TNF-α activity in MCF-7 cells. Normally proliferating MCF-7 (106/100-mm dish) cells were treated with aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) for 16 h, washed with 1 × HBSS buffer, and refed with 10% FCS/DMEM. TNF-α was added at the indicated times. For the blocking experiment, TNF-α (10 ng/ml) was preincubated with monoclonal anti-human TNF-α Ab (500 ng/ml) for 1 h at 37°C before adding to cells. Western immunoblot analysis using monoclonal anti-human Rb Ab (1 μg/ml) was carried out according to standard procedures. Detection of Rb protein was done by the ECL method.

At each time after release from growth arrest by aphidicolin, cells and cell lysates were harvested for Western blot and FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, tumor suppressor Rb protein showed induction at late G1 phase as expected. This induction of Rb protein remained through S phase and then declined to normal levels.

https://openalex.org/W2041922550,"The P-450 side chain cleavage (CYP11A1) gene encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in steroid biosynthesis, resulting in the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. Expression of the CYP11A1 gene is increased by hormones, such as adrenocorticotropin and luteinizing hormone, as well as by a number of growth factors, suggesting that its promoter may contain regulatory elements that respond to multiple signal transduction pathways. Using transient expression assays of the ovine CYP11A1 promoter in JEG-3 placental cells, distinct regulatory elements were found to mediate transcriptional stimulation by cAMP and epidermal growth factor (EGF). The cAMP response was mediated through a GC-rich sequence localized between −117 and −92. In contrast, EGF induced CYP11A1 transcription through an adjacent but distinct sequence (−92 to −77 base pairs) that was shown previously to bind nuclear proteins in DNase I footprinting reactions. This EGF-responsive element (EGF-RE) resembles an activator protein-1 (AP-1) site and was also required for transactivation by co-transfected c-Jun. A point mutation within the EGF-RE impaired stimulation by both EGF and c-Jun, suggesting that these pathways converge on a common regulatory element. Transfer of single or multiple copies of the EGF-RE upstream of an heterologous promoter conferred EGF and c-Jun responses, providing further evidence that this element is sufficient for both responses. Transfection studies employing mutant c-Jun proteins confirmed a requirement for its DNA binding, leucine zipper and amino-terminal domains, each of which are required for activation of a classical AP-1 reporter. Gel shift studies demonstrated that protein binding to the CYP11A1 EGF-RE was competed specifically by a canonical AP-1 site, and the addition of an anti-JUN antibody confirmed the presence of AP-1 proteins. Consistent with the possibility that EGF may act in part via c-Jun, EGF stimulated the activity of a chimeric GAL4 c-Jun protein, indicating that JUN can serve as a potential target of EGF in JEG-3 cells. EGF also induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and a dominant negative mutant of mitogen-activated protein kinase partially blocked EGF stimulation of GAL4 c-Jun activity. We conclude that EGF stimulates the CYP11A1 promoter through an AP-1 like element and that c-Jun is one of the targets of EGF action.

The cholesterol side chain cleavage (P-450 SCC or CYP11A1) enzyme is highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal gland, gonads, and placenta, where it catalyzes the initial step in steroid biosynthesis, converting cholesterol to pregnenolone. A number of different hormones and growth factors have been shown to regulate the expression and biosynthesis of this enzyme(1Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). In the adrenal gland, adrenocorticotropin increases CYP11A1 gene expression. In the gonads, its expression is controlled in part by follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Signaling via these G-protein-coupled receptors likely involves activation of the cAMP-stimulated protein kinase A pathway. CYP11A1 gene expression is also stimulated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) ( 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorEGF-REEGF-responsive elementMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasebpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionGPHαglycoprotein hormone α-subunitCREcAMP-responsive elementCREBCRE binding proteinTKthymidine kinaseLUCluciferaseOF4 and OF5ovine footprint 4 and 5, respectivelyRIPA bufferradioimmune precipitation buffer. )and insulin-like growth factor-1, which are produced locally in the adrenal cortex, corpus luteum, and placenta(2Baird A.

Given the multiple hormonal and growth factor inputs that regulate CYP11A1 gene expression, it is likely that a number of distinct DNA regulatory elements are required for normal physiologic responses that alter promoter activity. Transient gene expression studies have delineated several cAMP regulatory sequences in the promoters of CYP11A1 genes(7Pestell R.G. Hammond V. Crawford R. J. Mol.

Some of these cAMP regulatory elements differ from the canonical sequences that bind members of the B-Zip family such as CREB, activation transcription factors, c-Jun, and c-Fos and are comprised of GC-rich sequences that interact with proteins that remain to be fully characterized(8Momoi K.

Although the cAMP pathway is an important regulator of both basal and hormone-induced expression, basal promoter activity is also maintained independently of the cAMP pathway, perhaps by paracrine growth factors or other mechanisms(13Waterman M.R.

In this study, we sought to identify the CYP11A1 promoter regulatory elements that mediate EGF stimulation in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells.

JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, the media was changed after 6 h, and luciferase activity was determined after a further 24 h as described previously(32Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least three different plasmid preparations of each construct were used. In co-transfection experiments a dose response was determined in each experiment with 40, 60, 80, 100, or 200 ng of c-Jun expression vector and the CYP11A1 reporter plasmids (1.6 μg). EGF treatment was performed for 6-24 h at doses from 2 to 20 ng/ml to determine maximal responses. Subsequent experiments were conducted using EGF at 20 ng/ml for 24 h. In co-transfection experiments, comparison was made between the effect of transfecting 100 ng of active expression vector with the effect of an equal amount of the parental empty expression vector. Luciferase assays were performed at room temperature using an Autolumat LB 953 (EG& Berthold). Luciferase content was measured by calculating the light emitted during the initial 30 s of the reaction, and the values are expressed in arbitrary light units(32Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Background activity from cell extracts was typically <150 arbitrary light units/30 s. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays correspond to the CYP11A1 promoter AP-1-like region at −92 (5ʹ GCT GGA GTC AGC TGG 3ʹ), previously shown to include footprinted sequences referred to as ovine footprint 4 (OF4) (7Pestell R.G. Hammond V. Crawford R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The wild type AP-1 site (TCC ATT CTG ACT CAT TTT TTT TAA) and a mutant AP-1 site (TCC ATT CTG CCG CAT TTT TTT TAA) were used as controls. Nuclear extracts (7Pestell R.G. Hammond V. Crawford R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were used in electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays as described previously(32Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide gel in a 0.5 × TBE buffer (1 × TBE: 0.045 M Tris borate, 0.001 M EDTA) and 2.5% glycerol. Autoradiography was performed at −70°C using Kodak XAR5 film with an intensifying screen. Cell extracts were prepared from JEG-3 cells treated with EGF (10 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor α (50 ng/ml), or vehicle for 20 min and used for MAPK assays as recently described(15Kyriakis J.M.

Staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with anti-MAPK antibody (C16) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4°C. The antibody and beads were washed once with RIPA buffer and then incubated with cell lysates for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with RIPA buffer once, with LiCl, 0.1 M Tris base, pH 8.0, twice, and once in kinase buffer. The kinase reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer with 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) and 4 μg of myelin basic protein. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis upon termination of the reaction with Laemmli buffer and boiling. The phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was quantified by densitometry using a Fuji Bio Imaging Analyzer BAS 2000. For the detection of c-Jun protein, cell fractions from the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described(45Pagano M. Theodorus A.M. Tam S.W. Draetta G.F. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1627-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in 3-5 volumes of a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM Na3VO4) containing 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 μg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 1 μg/ml of aprotonin. After incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C to recover a Triton-soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of the same buffer containing 1% SDS. After incubation on ice for 30 min, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C to recover a Triton-insoluble fraction (supernatant). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (46Drust D.S. Troccoli N.M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and probed with a c-Jun antibody (c-jun Ab2, Oncogene Sciences, Uniondale, NY) at a 1:500 dilution. Reactive proteins were visualized using an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase second antibody, and reactive proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). EGF Stimulates CYP11A1 Transcription-The structure of the ovine CYP11A1 promoter and several of its regulatory DNA elements is depicted in Fig. 1A. The full-length −2700 CYPLUC reporter was transfected into JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells and examined for responsiveness to EGF. A dose-responsive increase in CYPLUC activity was observed with maximal stimulation (~5-fold) at 20 ng/ml (data not shown). When cells were treated for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, the maximal EGF effect was observed within 3 h and persisted at 24 h. A series of 5ʹ deletions of the CYP11A1 promoter was examined to delineate the minimal region responsive to EGF. Basal activity decreased progressively with deletions from −2700 to −92 bp (Fig. 1B). Although the basal activity of the −92 construct was relatively low (~3000 arbitrary light units), it was well above background luciferase activity. These same constructs were analyzed for induction by EGF (Fig. 1C). EGF responsiveness was similar (3.4-4.8-fold) for the −2700, −183, −117, and −92 bp constructs but decreased to less than 1.5-fold upon deletion from −92 to −77 bp (Fig. 1C). The deleted region that reduced EGF responsiveness corresponds to a protein binding region detected by DNase I footprinting(7Pestell R.G. Hammond V. Crawford R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter two nucleotides within a putative AP-1-like binding site. The mutation was studied within the context of the −117 bp promoter fragment because this region retains high basal activity and EGF responsiveness (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the putative AP-1 site decreased basal activity by greater than 80% and reduced EGF responsiveness to the level seen with the minimal promoter (−77 bp). These results indicate that the AP-1-like sequence contributes to basal expression and is necessary for EGF responsiveness. In order to assess whether the region between −92 and −77 was sufficient for activation by EGF, this sequence was linked to a heterologous promoter as single or multimeric sites (Fig. 2B). A single copy of the CYP11A1 element (p1(CYP AP-1)TKLUC) conveyed 5-6-fold activation by EGF, and there was greater induction after multimerization (p2(CYP AP-1)TKLUC, 7-fold; p3(CYP AP-1)TKLUC, 9-fold; p5(CYP AP-1)TKLUC, 14-fold). The previously characterized AP-1 reporter p3TPLUX(32Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a multimeric AP-1 site from the collagenase gene, was induced to a similar degree (6-fold) by EGF, whereas the control reporters, TKLUC and the plasmid vector pA3LUC, were not stimulated by EGF (Fig. 2B). Previous studies demonstrated that the DNA sequences responsible for cAMP induction of the ovine CYP11A1 promoter were located within 183 bp of the transcriptional start site(7Pestell R.G. Hammond V. Crawford R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A series of CYP11A1 5ʹ promoter deletion constructs were examined to assess whether activation of the protein kinase A pathway occurred through similar or distinct DNA sequences from those involved in EGF responsiveness. Cotransfection with the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAc) caused 8-fold stimulation, whereas no stimulation was seen with a mutant catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAcm) (Fig. 3A). Similar results were seen when 8-bromo-cAMP was used rather than PKAc (data not shown). There was a 50% reduction in PKAc-stimulated activity upon deletion from −117 to −92, which includes a GC-rich sequence highly homologous to the region involved in cAMP-induced transcription of the bovine CYP11A1 promoter(47Begeot M. Shetty U. Kilgore M. Waterman M. Simpson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17317-17325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When this (OF5) element (−117 to −92) was linked to a heterologous promoter and co-transfected into JEG-3 cells with the PKAc expression vector, it was sufficient to convey 6-7-fold activation (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the CYP11A1 sequences (−92 to −77 bp) sufficient for EGF responsiveness were not induced by the PKAc expression vector (Fig. 3B), and there was no significant additional activation by EGF in the presence of the PKAc expression vector (data not shown). These results indicate that the cAMP (−117 to −92 bp) and EGF (−92 to −77 bp) responsive regulatory elements are distinguishable. Because the EGF-RE contained an AP-1-like element, c-Jun was co-transfected to determine whether it was capable of simulating EGF-mediated activation of CYP11A1. The −2700 bp CYP11A1 promoter fragment was induced 6-fold by c-Jun (Fig. 4A), with somewhat less activation by co-transfection of Jun D (3.2-fold) or c-Fos (2.5-fold) (data not shown). Upon deletion from −92 to −77 bp, the induction by c-Jun was reduced from 4.4- to 1.4-fold (Fig. 4A), suggesting that it may act through the region required for EGF responsiveness. This issue was addressed further using the site-directed mutant that alters 2 bp within the putative AP-1 recognition site (Fig. 4B). As seen previously for EGF stimulation, this mutation reduced c-Jun-mediated transactivation by 70%. The effect of c-Jun was also analyzed using constructs in which the −92 to −77 region was linked to the minimal TK promoter as single or multimeric sites (Fig. 4C). This sequence was sufficient to convey 6-fold stimulation by c-Jun with progressively greater activation using multimerized elements (p2(CYP AP-1)TKLUC, 7-fold; p3(CYP AP-1)TKLUC, 8-fold; and p5(CYP AP-1)TKLUC, 13-fold). By comparison, the collagenase AP-1 reporter, p3TPLUX, was stimulated 7-fold by c-Jun, whereas TKLUC and the promoterless vector, pA3LUC, were not stimulated by c-Jun (Fig. 4C). The CYP OF5 TKLUC, which contains the cAMP-responsive sequences, was repressed 3-fold by c-Jun as was GPHαCRETKLUC (5-fold repression), which contains canonical CREs that mediate repression by c-Jun(32Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the CYP11A1 AP-1-like sequences by c-Jun was therefore comparable with that of the canonical AP-1 site and was mediated by sequences that correspond to the EGF-RE. A series of mutant c-Jun cDNAs were used to characterize the functional domains of the protein that are required for transcriptional induction of the CYP11A1 promoter (Fig. 5). These plasmids have been shown previously to express comparable amounts of protein in transfected cells(32Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Baichwal V.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Compared with the effect of the wild type c-Jun expression vector, mutations in the dimerization domain (Dimer-), the DNA-binding domain (DNA-), the amino terminus (N22 and N51), and the A2 activation domain mutant (A2-) reduced activation of −183 CYPLUC to less than 30% of wild type c-Jun. Dose response curves performed using up to 4-fold greater amounts of the mutants than wild type vector had little alteration in their effect on CYP11A1 transcription (data not shown). Similar effects of the c-Jun mutants were seen with the multimerized CYP AP-1 site (p3(CYP AP-1LUC)) and with p3TPLUX, which is analogous to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs used in previous studies of these mutants(38Baichwal V.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These results indicate a requirement for the DNA binding and transactivation domains of c-Jun for stimulation of the CYP11A1 promoter. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were performed using the CYP11A1 EGF-responsive sequence (−92 to −77 bp) and nuclear extracts from JEG-3 cells (Fig. 6A). Several protein complexes bound to the radiolabeled EGF-RE. Protein binding was competed specifically by excess unlabeled CYP11A1 AP-1 site or by the canonical AP-1 site from the collagenase gene but not by a mutant AP-1 sequence. A polyclonal antibody that"

https://openalex.org/W2082006537,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) gene expression and protein localization were analyzed during the process of myogenic differentiation. The mouse HB-EGF gene was isolated, and a 1.8-kilobase genomic fragment flanking the 5ʹ end of the cDNA was cloned. This fragment contains two sequences which match the consensus CANNTG sequence for E-boxes, binding sites for the MyoD family of DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate myogenesis. Accordingly, HB-EGF synthesis was analyzed in 10T1/2 cells and C2C12 cells which are used commonly for the study of myogenesis. HB-EGF gene expression was up-regulated in both cell types during myogenesis. In 10T1/2 cells, direct activation of HB-EGF gene expression by MyoD was shown in that: i) transient transfection of these cells with a plasmid expressing MyoD resulted in a 10-20-fold increase in endogenous HB-EGF mRNA levels; ii) co-transfection of MyoD and an HB-EGF promoter-reporter plasmid resulted in a 5-10-fold increase in reporter activity, an increase that was abrogated by deletion of a putative HB-EGF proximal E-box sequence; and iii) incubation of MyoD protein with a 25-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the HB-EGF proximal E-box sequence resulted in retarded electrophoretic mobility of the oligonucleotide. In C2C12 cells, differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes resulted in a 40-50-fold increase in HB-EGF promoter activity. In addition, immunostaining and laser confocal microscopy detected HB-EGF protein in C2C12 myotubes but not in myoblasts. The HB-EGF produced was in its transmembrane form and localized to the myotube surface.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor that can be processed to release the soluble mature form. Mature HB-EGF induces autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor (2Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) and is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells (SMC), and keratinocytes, but not for endothelial cells(1Besner G.

The growth factor was named HB-EGF because it binds tightly to immobilized heparin, unlike EGF and transforming growth factor-α(2Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). A heparin binding domain of 21 amino acids has been identified in HB-EGF that mediates interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans(6Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J.

These interactions modulate HB-EGF bioactivity, for example, by greatly enhancing its chemotactic activity for SMC (6Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and in enhancing cell toxicity when fused to a Pseudomonas toxin(8Mesri E.A. Ono M. Kreitman R.J. Klagsbrun M. Pastan I. J.

HB-EGF exists also as a biologically active membrane-spanning protein. Transmembrane forms of HB-EGF with molecular masses of 21.5-24 kDa, compared to 14-17-kDa forms of mature HB-EGF have been purified from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus construct encoding the entire open reading frame (ORF) of HB-EGF(9Ono M. Raab G. Lau K. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31315-31321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transmembrane HB-EGF (HB-EGF™) is cell-associated (10Raab G.

For example, HB-EGF™ stimulates phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and proliferation of adjacent cells (11Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and may mediate adhesion of mouse blastocysts(12Das S.K. Wang X.-N. Paria B.C. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development. 1994; 120: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HB-EGF™ is the receptor for diphtheria toxin(13Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and cells expressing the HB-EGF™/diphtheria toxin receptor are sensitive to the toxic effects of diphtheria toxin(10Raab G.

Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). When HB-EGF™ is processed to release soluble mature HB-EGF by phorbol esters, cells become diphtheria toxin-resistant, evidence for loss of the membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF(10Raab G. Higashiyama S. Hetelekidis S. Abraham J.A. Damm D. Ono M. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, the diphtheria toxin binding domain of HB-EGF has been localized to the EGF-like region (14Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The HB-EGF gene is expressed in a wide variety of cells and tissues. Northern blot analysis of tissues indicates that the highest levels of HB-EGF mRNA are found in lung, skeletal muscle, and heart(15Abraham J.A. Damm D. Bajardi A. Miller J. Klagsbrun M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). HB-EGF gene expression in cultured cells can be induced, particularly in vascular and inflammatory cells, by a variety of agents. For example, in cultured SMC, HB-EGF mRNA levels are increased by phorbol ester, thrombin, angiotensin II, and growth factors(16Dluz S.M. Higashiyama S. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol.

For example, HB-EGF mRNA and/or protein levels are increased in response to injury (5Marikovsky M. Breuing K. Liu P.Y. Eriksson E. Marikovsky M. Breuing K. Liu P.Y. Eriksson E. Higashiyama S. Farber P. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pathol. 1993; 147: 784-793Google Scholar). The inducibility of HB-EGF gene expression in vitro and in vivo prompted us to isolate and characterize the HB-EGF promoter in order to study the mechanisms of HB-EGF gene regulation. Recently, the structure of the human HB-EGF gene was reported and shown to encode the 6 exon/5 intron structure characteristic of members of the EGF family(24Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M. Hillkert R.J. Quertermous T. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lee M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7932-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In that study, a promoter-reporter construct composed of a 2.0-kb genomic fragment of human HB-EGF 5ʹ-flanking sequence linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) was active in endothelial cells. Concurrently, our laboratory has been analyzing the mouse HB-EGF gene and its promoter. Upon isolating and sequencing a 1.8-kb mouse HB-EGF genomic fragment that flanks the 5ʹ end of the cDNA, we noticed the presence of a CAGGTG and a CACCTG sequence located upstream from the HB-EGF transcription start site. These sequences correspond to the CANNTG consensus sequence that identifies the E-box(25Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H.

MyoD family members all have a characteristic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) structure and are expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle. Each of these transcription factors forms heterodimers with other bHLH proteins known as E proteins and bind to the E-box consensus sequence, resulting in the transcription of muscle-specific genes(25Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 26Braun T. Bober E. Winter B. Rosenthal N. Arnold H.H. Kotz S.

The presence of E-boxes in the HB-EGF promoter and our finding that human, rat, and mouse skeletal muscle tissues are among the most abundant tissue sources of HB-EGF mRNA (15Abraham J.A. Damm D. Bajardi A. Miller J. Klagsbrun M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) suggested that HB-EGF gene expression might be associated with myogenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that, during myogenesis, HB-EGF gene expression is up-regulated, that MyoD acts directly to transactivate the HB-EGF gene, that HB-EGF protein can be detected only in myotubes, and that it is the membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF, localized to the myotube surface, that is produced preferentially. Minimum essential medium (MEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), horse serum, RPMI 1640, and G418-sulfate (geneticin) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was obtained from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Iron-fortified bovine calf serum was obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS).

MyoD (pEMSV-MyoD) and MyoD mutant (pEMSV-MyoD, B2PB3, a single point amino acid mutation in the DNA binding region) expression plasmids were gifts from Dr. Andrew Lassar (Harvard Medical School)(28Davis R.L.

The bFGF promoter construct, P2.0 CAT(37Florkiewicz R. Shibata Z. Barankiewicz F. Baird A. Gonzalez A.-M. Florkiewicz E. Shah N. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The luciferase vector (pGL2-basic) was purchased from Promega. Fetal human vascular smooth muscle cells (FHVSMC) were maintained in DMEM/10% FCS/PS as described previously(16Dluz S.M. Higashiyama S. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18330-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Jian Wang (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA) and were maintained in DMEM/15% FCS/PS. After transfection with the MyoD expression plasmids, 10T1/2 cells were transferred to differentiation medium (DMEM/2% horse serum/PS) for analysis of HB-EGF promoter activity and mRNA expression. C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from Dr. Jian Wang (Children's Hospital, Boston MA) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS for growth. To differentiate C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes, cells were grown to 100% confluence in growth medium, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and switched to differentiation medium (DMEM/2% horse serum/PS). Differentiation occurred within 48 to 72 h. A mouse adult DBA/2J liver genomic library cloned into λEMBL3 (Catalog No. ML 1009d) was purchased from Clontech. The library was screened with a 32P-labeled (nick translation) 1.6-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment derived from the 3ʹ end of mouse HB-EGF cDNA or with a 470-bp 32P-labeled probe generated by polymerase chain reaction that corresponded to the 5ʹ end of mouse HB-EGF cDNA using methods previously described(38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out as described previously(16Dluz S.M. Higashiyama S. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18330-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washes were performed with 2 × SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Positive clones were digested with restriction enzymes SalI and EcoRI and subcloned into a Bluescript KS II(+) vector (Stratagene). Clones containing HB-EGF exons were identified by Southern blotting using the mouse HB-EGF cDNA as a probe. Insert fragments were subsequently sequenced from double-stranded templates by the dideoxy method (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52655) Google Scholar) using specific oligonucleotides as primers. The genomic nucleotide sequence has been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers L36024, L36025, L36026, and L36027). Primer extension analysis was carried out as described previously(40Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1992: 481-483Google Scholar). Briefly, two specific oligonucleotides complementary to the HB-EGF cDNA sequences, HB1 (5ʹ- CAGAGTCGGTCCGCGCGTCCACTCCAGCCCTTGAAGGTCTG-3ʹ, corresponding to sequences −219 to −179) and HB2 (5ʹ-CACCAACGCGGACAACACTGCGGCCAGAAAGAGCTTCAGC-3ʹ, corresponding to sequences +24 to +63) were first end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN). Labeled primer (1 × 105 cpm) was hybridized to 50 μg of total RNA derived from mouse lung, heart, and liver overnight at 42°C in 50% formamide, 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The annealed primer was then extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) as described previously (40Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1992: 481-483Google Scholar). The resulting products were treated with RNase A (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C, extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide-8 M urea gel. For precise mapping of the initiation site, a sequencing reaction of the promoter genomic clone using the same HB1 primer was run next to the primer extension on the same polyacrylamide gel. Total RNA was isolated from tissues or cells by homogenization in RNAzol “B” solution (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX) followed by a “single step” isolation method(41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63176) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously with minor modifications(16Dluz S.M. Higashiyama S. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18330-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HB-EGF promoter-reporter constructs were made using the vector pGL2-basic (Promega), a plasmid which contains the firefly luciferase gene but no promoter. The HB-EGF promoter-luciferase construct, pHB-EGF-Luc, was made by ligating a 1.7-kb MboI-NotI fragment derived from the 5ʹ end of the HB-EGF genomic clone (corresponding to sequences −1837 to −155) into the KpnI/BglII site of the polylinker situated in front of the luciferase gene. PGK-lacZ, a LacZ reporter, plasmid was used to correct for transfection efficiency. For transfection with HB-EGF-luciferase constructs as well as promoterless PGL-2-basic and pCMV-luciferase controls, cells (SMC, C2C12, 10T1/2) at 90% confluence (1.0 × 106 cells/transfection) were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in RPMI 1640/PS without FCS, and electroporated with 20 μg of luciferase plasmids and 2 μg of PGK-lacZ DNA using a gene pulser at settings of 960 μF and 200 V (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were plated in DMEM/10 or 20% FCS/PS, and, 20 h later, lysates were prepared and equal amounts of protein were assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available kit (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (BioOrbit 1251; Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 s at 25°C immediately following the addition of luciferase substrate (luciferin). lacZ activity was assayed using a β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System kit (Promega). To measure the induction of HB-EGF promoter activity in FHVSMC in response to a variety of agents, cells were electroporated with HB-EGF promoter-luciferase constructs and were plated in the absence or presence of either 200 nM phorbol ester, 2 units/ml human thrombin, or 50 μM lyso-PC for 48 h before being harvested for measurement of luciferase activity. To measure HB-EGF promoter activity in C2C12 cells during differentiation, cells were transfected first with HB-EGF promoter-reporter plasmids and then plated into 6 well plates in growth medium (DMEM/20% FCS/PS). To promote differentiation, wells were switched to differentiation medium (DMEM/2% horse serum/PS) the next day. Differentiation occurred in about 3 days at which point luciferase activity was measured. To measure HB-EGF promoter activity in response to MyoD expression, 10T1/2 fibroblasts were co-transfected with 10 μg of HB-EGF promoter-reporter plasmid and 20 μg of MyoD expression plasmids. Transfected cells were plated immediately into differentiation medium (DMEM/2% horse serum/PS), and, 24 h later, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. A bFGF-promoter-luciferase construct was made by ligating a 2.0-kb SalI-XhoI fragment of pF2.0 CAT into the XhoI site of pGL2 basic, and the correct orientation of clones was screened by restriction analysis. To prepare an HB-EGF promoter-luciferase construct in which the E-box most proximal to the transcription initiation site was deleted, a genomic subclone that contains a 580-bp XbaI/NotI promoter fragment (containing sequences −646 to −155) cloned in pBluescript was digested with the restriction enzymes XcmI and PpuMI to delete the sequences between −605 and −428. The DNA was then blunt-ended with Klenow, and the largest fragment was isolated and self-ligated. The insert of the resulting clone was released by restriction digestion with XbaI/SacII and ligated into the corresponding XbaI-SacII site of the wild type HB-EGF promoter-Luc construct. To prepare MyoD + E12 protein for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, transcription and translation reactions were carried out in vitro using a commercially available kit, TNT™ T3 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg each of MyoD and E12 cDNA plasmids were incubated with TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of T3 RNA polymerase and a mixture of amino acids lacking leucine and methionine in a 50-μl total volume at 30°C for 120 min. To monitor MyoD + E12 protein production, 35S-labeled proteins were synthesized in parallel using L-[35S]methionine (>800 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyacrylamide gel. Complementary strands of oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to: (i) an HB-EGF promoter sequence encompassing −518 to −493 that contains the putative proximal E-box binding site (5ʹ-CGGTCTTCGCCACCTGCTGCTGGTCATTC-3ʹ, (ii) a similar sequence but mutated by making substitutions in the E-box core (5ʹCGGTCTTCTCTAGATGCTGGTCATTC-3ʹ), and (iii) a bona fide MyoD E-box binding site obtained from the muscle creatine kinase enhancer (5ʹ-GATCCCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGA-3ʹ)(29Lassar A.B.

The oligonucleotides were first labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and then annealed to form double-stranded oligonucleotides. Assays were performed as described previously(28Davis R.L. Cheng P.-F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of MyoD + E12 proteins synthesized in vitro were mixed with an additional 5 μl of fresh reticulocyte lysates and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. Ten μl of 2× concentrated DNA binding mixture were then added such that the final concentrations of each component were 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor (Pharmacia), and 1 × 104 cpm (0.1-0.3 ng) of 32P-labeled double-stranded probe. Following incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the reaction mixtures were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA). The polyacrylamide gel was subsequently dried and exposed to Kodak x-ray AR film at −70°C with an intensifying screen. For competition analysis, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were preincubated with the MyoD + E12 proteins on ice for 10 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe.

https://openalex.org/W2098023801,"In vertebrate skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction coupling may occur by a mechanical coupling mechanism involving protein-protein interactions between the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) of the transverse tubule membrane and the ryanodine receptor (RYR)/Ca2+ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. We have previously shown that the cytoplasmic II-III loop peptides of the skeletal and cardiac muscle DHPR α1 subunits (SDCL and CDCL, respectively) activate the skeletal muscle RYR. We now report that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser687 of SDCL yields a peptide that fails to activate the RYR, as determined in [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel measurements. The phosphorylated SDCL bound to the skeletal muscle but not cardiac muscle RYR, and the binding could be displaced by the unphosphorylated SDCL. A mutant SDCL with a Ser687→ Ala substitution failed to activate the RYR, but was still able to bind. Similarly, a Ser813→ Ala substitution in CDCL yielded a peptide that failed to activate the skeletal RYR. Use of three smaller overlapping peptides within the SDCL region identified an amino acid region from 666 to 726 including Ser687, which bound to and activated the skeletal muscle RYR. These results suggest that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the DHPR α1 subunit may play a role in the functional interaction of the DHPR and RYR in skeletal muscle.

The SR Ca2+ release channels are also known as ryanodine receptors (RYR) because of their ability to bind the plant alkaloid ryanodine with high affinity and specificity(1Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In vertebrate skeletal muscle, the SR Ca2+ release channels are thought to be linked to another Ca2+ channel (L-type), also known as the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), which is located in infoldings of the surface membrane, the transverse (T-) tubule(3Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar).Different E-C coupling mechanisms exist in vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscle. A major difference is that E-C coupling in cardiac muscle is dependent on extracellular Ca2+, whereas skeletal muscle E-C coupling is not. In cardiac muscle, the entry of extracellular Ca2+ via a voltage-sensitive DHPR/Ca2+ channel is required to trigger Ca2+ release from SR(4Wier W.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 467-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in vertebrate skeletal E-C coupling, the Ca2+ release channels are thought to be regulated by a skeletal muscle DHPR isoform through protein-protein interactions(5Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 6Schneider M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition to a direct activation by the DHPR, an involvement of Ca2+ in activating the SR Ca2+ release channel during E-C coupling has been described(6Schneider M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).The skeletal and cardiac muscle DHPRs are related oligomeric protein complexes, which comprise up to five subunits, all of which have cytoplasmic domains that could potentially interact with the SR Ca2+ release channel(7Catterall W.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 871-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similarly, skeletal and cardiac muscle express two structurally related Ca2+ release channels composed of four identical ~565-kDa polypeptides(1Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In addition to the DHPR, several endogenous effector molecules were shown to regulate the RYR. These include small diffusible molecules such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and ATP, and proteins such as calmodulin, FK506-binding protein, and triadin(2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). An involvement of triadin in mediating the functional interaction between the skeletal muscle DHPR and RYR has been suggested(8Brandt N.R. Caswell A.H. Brunschwig J.P. Kang J.J. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Studies with skeletal and cardiac muscle chimeric cDNAs suggest that the putative II-III cytoplasmic loop region of the DHPR α1 subunit is a major determinant of the type of E-C coupling (skeletal or cardiac) that occurs in muscle(9Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). We expressed the II-III loop regions of the skeletal and cardiac DHPR α1 subunits and showed that both peptides activate the purified skeletal but not the cardiac muscle Ca2+ release channel(10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the interaction was specific with respect to the skeletal muscle RYR but not with respect to the peptides.The skeletal muscle DHPR contains several consensus phosphorylation sites including a serine residue, Ser687, in the II-III loop region of the α1 subunit which is rapidly phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)(11Rohrkasten A. Meyer H.E. Nastainczyk W. Sieber M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rotman E.I. De Jongh K.S. Florio V. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16100-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the skeletal muscle DHPR was shown to modulate L-type Ca2+ channel activity(13Nunoki K. Florio V. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6816-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Mundina-Weilenmann C. Ma J. Rios E. Hosey M.M. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here, we report that phosphorylation of Ser687 of SDCL by PKA in vitro resulted in the formation of a peptide that failed to activate the RYR. This result provides novel evidence for a role of DHPR phosphorylation in regulating DHPR protein-RYR protein interactions in skeletal muscle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCatalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart was purchased from Sigma and [3H]ryanodine (54.7 Ci/mmol) from DuPont NEN. Unlabeled ryanodine was obtained from AgriSystems International (Wind Gap, PA), Pefabloc (a protease inhibitor) from Boehringer Mannheim, and phospholipids from Avanti (Birmingham, AL). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Site-directed MutagenesisThe site-directed mutants SDCLS687A and CDCLS813A were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mutagenic primers, 5’-GGA GAC CCC TGG CCA TCT TCC TGC-3’ and 5’-CTT CTC CGG AGC GGC AGT CCT GGC CAG C-3’, were designed to change Ser687 to Ala of SDCL (15Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) and Ser813 to Ala of CDCL(16Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), respectively. The megaprimers were amplified with the mutagenic primers and 5’ primers in the first round PCR. The PCR products were agarose gel-purified and used as megaprimers with the 3’ primers to amplify mutant SDCL and CDCL in the second round PCR. The PCR products were subcloned into the expression vector pET-11d and the mutant SDCLS687A and CDCLS813A plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Preparation of DHPR-derived PeptidesSDCLf1 (Glu666-Glu726), SDCLf2 (Pro709-Leu766) and SDCLf3 (Lys733-Leu791) cDNAs (15Tanabe T.

Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using SDCL as template and subcloned in the pET-11d vector. The constructed plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, followed by hydroxyapatite column chromatography as described(10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Vitro PhosphorylationCatalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) from bovine heart (Sigma) was reconstituted in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C. Phosphorylation reaction was carried out by adding the peptides (1 μg) to kinase reaction buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) plus 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (~3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and 5 units of PKA in a volume of 30 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The gel was fixed in 12% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film. The percentage of 32P incorporation was determined in the presence of 5-fold excess of ATP over SDCL by scintillation counting of the dried gel containing the 32P-labeled peptides. To prepare 32P-labeled SDCL as a probe for 32P-SDCL binding assay, SDCL (2 μg) was incubated with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 15 units of PKA in 30 μl of buffer A at room temperature for 30 min. The 32P-labeled SDCL was freed of [γ-32P]ATP by gel filtration on a G-25 Sephadex column. To prepare the cold phosphorylated SDCL, 0.5 mg of SDCL was incubated with 1.5 mM ATP and 500 units of PKA in 1 ml of buffer A at room temperature for 1 h. Free ATP was removed by dialysis against 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl. The phosphorylated SDCL was concentrated with a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.Isolation of SR Vesicles and Purification of RYRHeavy SR vesicles were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors from rabbit skeletal and canine heart muscle as described(17Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2365-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Meissner G. Henderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RYR was purified in the presence of CHAPS as a 30 S protein complex by sucrose gradient rate centrifugation and reconstituted into proteoliposomes by removal of the detergent by dialysis(19Lee H.B. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13305-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).[3H]Ryanodine BindingUnless otherwise indicated, [3H]ryanodine binding was determined by incubating skeletal muscle SR vesicles at 12°C for 20 h in 100 μl of 20 mM Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.125 mM CaCl2, 5 mM AMP, 100 μM leupeptin, 0.5 mM Pefabloc, and 5 nM [3H]ryanodine. Bound and free [3H]ryanodine were determined by a filtration assay as described(19Lee H.B. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13305-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine.Single Channel RecordingsSingle channel measurements were performed by fusing reconstituted proteoliposomes containing the purified skeletal muscle RYR Ca2+ release channel (19Lee H.B. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13305-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with Muller-Rudin type planar lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine in the ratio of 5:3:2, respectively (25 mg/ml phospholipid in n-decane)(10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Channels were initially recorded in a symmetric KCl buffer solution containing 20 mM K-Pipes, pH 7.0, 0.25 M KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, and 0.1 mM EGTA. Before the addition of the peptides, channel open probability (Po) was lowered to < 0.1 by the addition of EGTA to the cis chamber. The data files were acquired and analyzed using a commercially available software package (pClamp 6.0.1, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) in the continuous fetchex mode, using a filter frequency setting at 2 kHz and sampling rate at 10 kHz. Channel open probabilities were determined by 50% threshold analysis as described previously(20Smith J.S. Coronado R. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).32P-SDCL OverlayProteoliposomes containing the purified skeletal RYR and skeletal and cardiac muscle SR vesicles were dot-blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in binding buffer B (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 0.125 mM CaCl2). The membranes were washed once with buffer B and placed on a piece of parafilm. The binding reaction was carried out by overlaying the membranes with buffer B supplemented with 32P-labeled SDCL (5 × 106 cpm/ml), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 100 μM leupeptin, and 0.5 mM Pefabloc. After incubation for 12 h at room temperature, the membranes were washed twice for 5 min with ice-cold buffer B, air-dried, and exposed to an x-ray film. Bound 32P-labeled SDCL was quantitated by scintillation counting.RESULTSPhosphorylation of SDCLIn purified skeletal muscle DHPR preparations, cAMP-dependent protein kinase rapidly phosphorylates Ser687 in the cytoplasmic II-III loop region of the DHPR α1 subunit (SDCL)(11Rohrkasten A. Meyer H.E. Nastainczyk W. Sieber M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rotman E.I. De Jongh K.S. Florio V. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16100-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the effects of Ser687 phosphorylation on SR Ca2+ release channel function were examined, using the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated SDCL as probes in [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel measurements. In some experiments, the cytoplasmic II-III loop peptide of the cardiac DHPR α1 subunit (CDCL) served as a control, as CDCL lacks a phosphorylation site corresponding to Ser687 in SDCL. SDCL and CDCL were expressed in E. coli, and purified by DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxyapatite column chromatography(10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE indicated that the two peptides were obtained with a purity > 99% (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). The purified peptides were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by PKA as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the autoradiographs, a prominent 32P-labeled band with a mobility corresponding to that of SDCL was observed (Fig. 1B, lane 2). A corresponding 32P-labeled band was not detected in the lane containing CDCL (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The molar ratio of phosphate to SDCL was determined by scintillation counting to be 0.94 (data not shown), indicating only one phosphorylation site in SDCL. To confirm the presence of a single phosphorylation site in SDCL, a single point mutant with substitution of Ser687 to Ala was prepared. The derived peptide SDCLS687A migrated on the gels at the same position as wild type SDCL (Fig. 1A, lane 3), but could no longer be phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 1B, lane 3). These results indicate that Ser687 is phosphorylated by PKA, and that it is the only PKA-dependent phosphorylation site in SDCL.Effects of Phosphorylated and Mutant SDCL Peptides on [3H]Ryanodine BindingTo assess the effects of phosphorylation on RYR function, a nonradioactively phosphorylated SDCL (SDCL-P) was prepared. In control experiments, SDCL-P did not incorporate any radioactivity when incubated with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated peptides also showed no significant incorporation of 32P label following their incubation with SR vesicles under conditions comparable to the [3H]ryanodine binding measurements. These results indicated that essentially fully phosphorylated SDCL peptides were used in the functional studies described below.The RYR was shown to bind the neutral plant alkaloid ryanodine with nanomolar affinity in a manner that correlates well with the functional state of the Ca2+ release channel(1Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). An increase in [3H]ryanodine binding affinity by micromolar concentrations of SDCL and CDCL has been described(10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of the unphosphorylated (SDCL), phosphorylated (SDCL-P), and mutant (SDCLS687A) SDCL peptides on [3H]ryanodine binding to SR vesicles are illustrated in Fig. 2. As shown previously (10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the unphosphorylated SDCL increased [3H]ryanodine binding in a dose-dependent manner. At 10 μM, SDCL increased [3H]ryanodine binding by about 50% (Fig. 2, closed circles). In contrast, the phosphorylated SDCL was without a significant effect. A small (~10%) increase in [3H]ryanodine binding was observed at 10 μM SDCL-P (Fig. 2, triangles). The mutant peptide SDCLS687A was without an effect on [3H]ryanodine binding to the SR vesicles (Fig. 2, open circles).Figure 2:Effect of peptides on [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal SR vesicles. SR vesicles (150 μg of protein/ml) were incubated with 5 nM [3H]ryanodine and the indicated amounts of SDCL (closed circles), SDCLS687A (open circles), CDCL (closed diamonds), CDCLS813A (open diamonds), and phosphorylated SDCL (triangles) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the means ± S.D. of two or three experiments carried out in duplicate. Bmax value for [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal SR vesicles in the absence of peptides was 9.5 pmol/mg as determined by Scatchard analysis. The control value (100%, without added peptides) corresponded to about 10% of the Bmax value of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The lack of activation of [3H]ryanodine binding by the phosphorylated and mutant peptides, shown in Fig. 2, could have been due to a decrease in the binding affinity of the peptides and/or the formation of inactive peptides. To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out binding studies (see below) and determined the effects of the peptides on [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of SDCL and CDCL. Fig. 3A shows that 5 μM SDCL increased [3H]ryanodine binding to the skeletal SR vesicles by about 50%, and the addition of the phosphorylated and mutant peptides resulted in a decrease of [3H]ryanodine binding close to control levels (-SDCL). Half-maximal inhibition of the SDCL-activated binding activity by ~5 μM SDCL-P (Fig. 3A, triangles) and ~4 μM SDCLS687A (open circles) suggested that the three peptides bound to the RYR with similar affinity.Figure 3:Effects of SDCL-P, SDCLS687A, and CDCLS813A on [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal SR vesicles in the presence of SDCL or CDCL. Skeletal SR vesicles (150 μg/ml) were incubated in reaction mixture containing 5 μM SDCL (A) or 5 μM CDCL (B) and 5 nM [3H]ryanodine in the presence of the indicated amounts of SDCLS687A (open circles), CDCLS813A (closed circles), and SDCL-P (triangles). Values are the means ± S.D. of two or three experiments carried out in duplicate. The control value (100%, without added peptides) corresponded to about 10% of the Bmax value of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Mutant CDCL Peptide on [3H]Ryanodine BindingWe were surprised to find that our mutant SDCL with Ser687→Ala substitution failed to activate the skeletal muscle RYR, because a Ser → Ala mutation is in general considered to be a conserved mutation. This result suggested that Ser687 may be essential for RYR activation. To confirm the role of Ser687 in the formation of an active SDCL peptide, we prepared a mutant CDCLS813A with a Ser813→ Ala substitution. We choose to replace Ser813 of CDCL because of its close position to Ser687 of SDCL in the amino acid sequence alignments (Fig. 1C). The mutant SDCLS813A was overproduced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described in “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows that, in agreement with a previous study(10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type CDCL is more potent than SDCL in increasing [3H]ryanodine binding to the SR vesicles. CDCL increased [3H]ryanodine binding by about 75% at 10 μM concentration (Fig. 2, closed diamonds). In contrast, a single point mutation in CDCL (CDCLS813A) yielded a peptide that was without an effect on [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 2, open diamonds).The mutant CDCL peptide was as effective as the phosphorylated and mutant SDCL peptides in inhibiting the SDCL-activated RYR. Fig. 3A (closed circles) shows that the addition of 20 μM CDCLS813A to incubation media containing 5 μM SDCL resulted in a [3H]ryanodine binding level close to the control level (-SDCL). Similarly, the mutant SDCL and CDCL peptides were able to inhibit the CDCL-activated RYR (Fig. 3B). The addition of 5 μM CDCL increased [3H]ryanodine binding by about 65%. This increase was nearly fully prevented by the addition of an excess (20 μM) of the mutant SDCL and CDCL peptides.Previously, we showed that BSA activated the RYR by a mechanism different from that of the DHPR loop peptides(10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, the mutant peptides SDCLS687A and CDCLS813A did not inhibit the increased [3H]ryanodine binding activity of the RYR observed in the presence of BSA (data not shown).Effects of Phosphorylated and Mutant SDCL Peptides on Single Channel ActivitiesAn antagonistic action of the phosphorylated and mutant SDCL peptides was also observed in single Ca2+ release channel measurements. Single, purified channels were recorded in symmetric 250 mM KCl medium. With K+ as the current carrier, single channel conductance was ~770 picosiemens (not shown). To optimize stimulation of channel activity by SDCL, we limited the initial channel open probabilities (Po) to <0.1 by adjusting the free Ca2+ concentration in the cis chamber to about 5 μM by addition of EGTA (Fig. 4, top panels). In Fig. 4A, the addition of 100 nM SDCL increased Po from 0.029 to 0.121 (middle panel). The bottom trace of Fig. 4A shows that the subsequent addition of 100 nM phosphorylated SDCL reduced channel activity about 2-fold (Po = 0.062) corresponding to a level about twice that before the addition of SDCL. A comparable activation of channel activity by 100 nM SDCL and about 2-fold inhibition of the SDCL-activated channel by 200 nM SDCLS687A are shown in Fig. 4B. An inhibition of the SDCL-activated channels by SDCL-P and SDCLS687A was observed in 8 (out of 8) and 9 (out of 9) experiments, respectively (Table 1). The single channel data of Table 1 are in good agreement with the [3H]ryanodine binding measurements. Furthermore, because of the use of purified RYRs, the single channel measurements suggest that the phosphorylated SDCL and SDCLS687A antagonized the action of SDCL by a direct interaction with the RYR.Figure 4:Effects of SDCL-P and SDCLS687A on single channel activity of the purified skeletal Ca2+ release channel in the presence of SDCL.

To examine their binding to the skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle RYRs, we developed a protein overlay assay using 32P-labeled SDCL as a probe. Skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle SR vesicles containing a similar number of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding sites were dot-blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and overlaid with 32P-labeled SDCL. In the autoradiographs, skeletal muscle SR vesicles, but not cardiac SR vesicles, retained 32P-labeled SDCL (Fig. 5), suggesting that 32P-labeled SDCL binds specifically to the skeletal muscle RYR. Fig. 5 also shows that 32P-labeled SDCL binds to the purified skeletal RYR, suggesting a direct interaction between the RYR and 32P-labeled SDCL.Figure 5:Specific binding of 32P-labeled SDCL to the skeletal RYR. A nitrocellulose membrane was dot-blotted with proteoliposomes containing the purified rabbit skeletal muscle RYR (RYR(s), 2 μg), rabbit skeletal muscle SR vesicles (SR (s), 30 μg), and canine cardiac muscle SR vesicles (SR(c), 30 μg) and overlaid with 5 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled SDCL as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The interaction of RYR with other DHPR peptides was further examined in competition binding experiments. Fig. 6 shows that the unphosphorylated, nonradioactively labeled phosphorylated and mutant SDCLs, and CDCL decreased binding of the 32P-labeled SDCL to the purified skeletal muscle RYR by 73%, 52%, 61%, and 53%, respectively (lanes 2-4 and 8). These data are consistent with binding of the peptides to the same site(s) of the skeletal RYR. However, because of difficulties in quantitating the binding data over a sufficient range of peptide concentrations, binding to different sites cannot be ruled out at this time.Figure 6:Effects of peptides on 32P-labeled SDC"

INTRODUCTIONPaired protein channels located in specialized areas of closely apposed plasma membranes, termed gap junctions, act to connect the interiors of adjacent cells in a tissue. These channels allow for direct intercellular communication between cells by acting as a conduit for the passage of ions and small molecules, and they are important for the regulation of development and cell growth (for reviews, see Refs. 1, 2). It is now recognized that a family of gap junction proteins exists, members of which are expressed differentially in virtually all cell types(3Beyer E.C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 1-37PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).This study has focused on the gap junction channel of rat livers which is comprised primarily of a single 32-kDa protein component(5Goodenough D.A.

Chem. 1984; 259: 9936-9943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with less than 5% of the gap junction protein being a related 26-kDa protein species(8Nicholson B. Dermietzel R. Teplow D. Willecke K. Revel J.-P. Nature. 1987; 329: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The mRNAs for both proteins have been cloned and sequenced(9Paul D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 10Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 11Zhang J.T.

These are referred to as β1 (or Cx32) and β2 (or Cx26) gap junction proteins.Electrophoretically eluted (from SDS-polyacrylamide gels) rat liver β1 protein has been reported to form voltage-dependent channels in reconstituted lipid bilayers (12Young J.D. Cohn Z.A. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 733-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the topology of the molecule has been partially mapped (13Zimmer D.B. Green C.R. Evans W.H.

Upon isolation and purification, hepatic gap junction proteins form extended two-dimensional crystalline arrays. Low resolution three-dimensional structural information has been obtained from electron micrographs of tilted specimens (17Unwin P.N.T. Zampighi G. Nature. 1980; 283: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 18Unwin P.N.T. Ennis P.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M.

Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that each channel is composed of two hexameric assemblies which span the opposing membranes and meet at the center of the gap. Additionally, the secondary structure of the rat liver gap junction channel in sonicated membrane patches has been determined by circular dichroism (CD) studies(22Cascio M. Gogol E. Wallace B.A. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2358-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the presence of the membrane bilayer in which the oligomers are embedded has precluded structural examination of the oligomer at a molecular level. Conditions have been described (19Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) under which the β1 connexin protein may be solubilized by detergent while retaining a native-like structure.Using conditions similar to those described by Stauffer et al.(19Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we have isolated and purified the rat liver β1 gap junction protein in a “native” oligomeric state. These isolated complexes were, in turn, characterized to determine the physical properties of the oligomeric unit.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFemale retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats, ranging from 200 to 300 g were obtained from Holtzman Laboratories (Madison, WI). N-N-Dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) 1The abbreviations used are: LDAON-N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxideDTTdithiothreitolTEAtriethanolamineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFPLCfast performance liquid chromatographyNRMSDnormalized root mean standard deviationPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDMSdimethyl suberimidate. was purchased from Fluka (Switzerland). Dodecyl maltoside and dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Tris, HEPES, and triethanolamine (TEA) were purchased from Sigma. EDTA was purchased from Fisher.Specimen PreparationSubcellular fractions of enriched rat liver gap junctions were prepared by alkali-extraction (NaOH) of rat liver plasma membrane fractions according to Hertzberg(7Hertzberg E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9936-9943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Zimmer et al.(13Zimmer D.B. Green C.R. Evans W.H. Gilula N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7751-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated gap junction fractions were stored in 2 mM bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.5, at −70°C.Gel FiltrationGel filtration was carried out on a Waters 510 HPLC system equipped with an LKB Uvicord SII model 2238 detector and a 277-nm filter. Separations were performed at 0.5 ml/min on a 7.5 × 300 mm TSK G3000SW column with a 7.5 × 75 mm TSK SWP pre-column (Toyo Soda, Japan) by isocratic elution with 1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mM DTT, and 0.05% LDAO.Markers used in the Stokes radius determination were horse heart myoglobin (Sigma), bovine heart malate dehydrogenase (Sigma), bovine heart lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), horse spleen ferritin (Gallard Schlesinger), β-galactosidase (Worthington Biochemicals), and blue dextran (Sigma).Isolated gap junctions were solubilized by resuspension of the pellet (15 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C) in 0.4% LDAO, 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 9.4, and 10 mM DTT at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The suspension was vortexed for at least 2 h at 4°C. The sample was then diluted with an equal volume of 100 mM Tris at pH 7.2. Particulates were pelleted as before, and 200 μl of the supernatant was injected onto the column. In this paper, the non-pelleting material in the presence of detergent will be referred to as gap junction complexes or oligomers.Larger scale separations (>500 μg) were conducted on a Pharmacia FPLC system equipped with a P-500 pump and a UV-1 monitor with a 280-nm filter using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia). Samples were prepared as above except the sample was solubilized in 100 mM glycine, pH 10.0, 2 M NaCl, 100 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, and 2.0% LDAO to give a final concentration of ~0.5 mg/ml, and then concentrated 2-3-fold using a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Danver, MA). A 1.0-ml aliquot was injected onto the column, using a running buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.0 M NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5% LDAO at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Eluant of HPLC and FPLC were monitored for gap junction content by electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and/or immunoblotting.UltracentrifugationLinear 2-ml 5-20% or 10-25% sucrose gradients (Schwarz/Mann UltraPure grade) in H2O or D2O in 20 mM Tris, pH 9.2, 1 M NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.05% LDAO were generated by freezing and thawing a gradient containing five steps of sucrose. Marker proteins or solubilized gap junction samples (separated by HPLC or FPLC) were applied to the top of the gradients. All marker proteins were purchased from Sigma, and their respective partial specific volumes and corrected sedimentation coefficients were: horse heart myoglobin, 0.741 ml/g and 2.04 s, chicken egg ovalbumin, 0.744 ml/g and 3.53 s, bovine transferrin, 0.725 ml/g and 4.92 s, rabbit muscle aldolase, 0.735 ml/g and 7.35 s, and bovine liver catalase, 0.730 ml/g and 11.30 s(23le Maire M. Aggerbeck L.P. Monteilhet C. Andersen J.P. Moller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Gradients were centrifuged at 55,000 for 4 h at 4°C (no brake) in a TLS55 swinging bucket rotor in a TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Gradients were fractionated by piercing with a 25-gauge needle. The refractive indices of the fractions were determined with an Atago R5000 hand refractometer. The sedimentation of the markers was determined by SDS-PAGE and the presence of gap junction complexes by electron microscopy.SDS-PAGEPreparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli(24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 224: 149-154Google Scholar), but without boiling. Bands were visualized by Coomassie (Brilliant) Blue or silver staining(13Zimmer D.B. Green C.R. Evans W.H. Gilula N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7751-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ImmunoblottingAffinity-purified antibodies prepared against synthetic peptides corresponding to proposed cytoplasmic loops of the human β1 liver protein (14Milks L.C. Kumar N.M. Houghten R. Unwin N. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and the rat β2 liver protein (25Risek B. Guthrie S. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) were used for immunoblotting. These antibodies were prepared, purified, and characterized as described previously(14Milks L.C. Kumar N.M. Houghten R. Unwin N. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Western transfers were conducted using a modification of the procedure of Towbin et al.(26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar), as described by Milks et al.(14Milks L.C. Kumar N.M. Houghten R. Unwin N. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected by 125I-protein A and visualized by autoradiography. Where noted, band intensities were digitized with an LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer.Electron MicroscopyAcetone-washed 400 mesh copper grids (Ernest Fullam Co.) were coated with 5% collodion in amyl acetate (Ted Pella, Inc.) and stabilized with a carbon film using an Edwards E306A Coating System. The collodion was then removed with acetone, and the grids glow-discharged using an EMscope model 350 unit. Samples were applied to the grids for 1 min and then blot dried using filter paper applied to the grid edge. Each grid was washed three times by inversion onto a drop of 10 mM Tris-buffered solution, pH 9.2, for 1 min, with blotting between washes, and stained by inverting on a drop of 1% uranyl acetate solution for 1-2 min and blot-dried. Samples were examined on a Philips CM-12 electron microscope at 100 kV.Circular Dichroism SpectroscopyNative double-membrane junctions were pelleted as before, resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 9.2, and sonicated to clarity with a Branson Sonifier microprobe using repeated 8-12-s bursts. During this procedure, the sample vial was placed in an ice water-jacketed chamber to prevent heating. Typically, five bursts were sufficient to render the solution transparent. The membrane suspensions were centrifuged at 12,800 × g for 15 min and the supernatant containing the smaller membranes fragments used for further analysis.The isolated gap junction oligomers were purified by FPLC prior to CD examination. The samples were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, pH 9.2, 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.05% LDAO and concentrated using an Amicon microconcentrator and characterized as above. Aliquots of the dialysate were used as blanks.CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv 61DS spectropolarimeter. The spectropolarimeter was calibrated for wavelength using benzene vapor. The optical rotation was calibrated with D-10-camphorsulfonic acid and checked with sperm whale myoglobin.Optical measurements of ellipticity were routinely made at room temperature using a demountable quartz cell (Hellma Kuvetten, Mullheim/Baden, Germany) of pathlength 0.5 mm for the junctions and 0.1 mm for the isolated oligomers. Data was collected at 0.2-nm intervals in the wavelength range between 300 and 185 nm for the former, and between 300 and 195.4 nm for the latter (the presence of high salt, DTT, and LDAO in the solubilization buffer precluded collection at lower wavelengths). At least 15 reproducible scans were collected for each sample, averaged, and then smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (27Savitzky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (14611) Google Scholar).The CD spectra were analyzed in the wavelength range from 190 to 240 nm using a non-linear least-squares curve-fitting procedure, with the values of the fractions of secondary structure constrained to be non-negative and normalized, as described previously(28Mao D. Wachter E. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The reference data set (29Chang C.T. Wu C.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) was augmented with a basement membrane collagen data set (22Cascio M. Gogol E. Wallace B.A. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2358-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to correct for any collagen content. A helix length of 20 residues, the minimum length of helix necessary to span the lipid bilayer, was used in all analyses. The quality of the fit of the reference spectra to the experimental data was evaluated by calculating a fit parameter, the normalized root mean standard deviation (NRMSD) (28Mao D. Wachter E. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).The spectrum of a polypeptide in the near UV region is a sum of the individual absorbances of three peptide transitions in this region: a single n to π*, and two π to π* transitions, one parallel and one perpendicular to the optical beam. Since the energy, and thus the location of the absorption peak, of each transition dipole is affected by the dipole moment of its local environment, the CD bands of the various peptide transitions of membrane proteins may be differentially red- or blue-shifted relative to their location in the spectrum of an aqueous protein(30Cascio M. Wallace B.A. Protein Peptide Lett. 1994; 1: 136-140Google Scholar). Accordingly, additional analyses were conducted in which the reference basis sets were deconvoluted to yield three gaussian absorption bands, and these bands shifted independently to optimize the fit of the reference data base to the experimental spectrum as reflected by minimization of the NRMSD(22Cascio M. Gogol E. Wallace B.A. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2358-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cascio M. Wallace B.A. Proteins. 1988; 4: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Cascio M. Wallace B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The calculated secondary structures determined by this type of analysis may reflect the actual secondary structure present more accurately and are included in the calculations as a limit for the variability in our calculations of net protein conformation.Cross-linkingGap junction membranes were solubilized in 2% Dodecyl maltoside, 20 mM TEA, pH 9.2, 20 mM EDTA, and 10 mM DTT, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. To cross-link, a 100 mM DMS (Pierce) stock solution in 200 mM TEA, pH 9.2, was diluted 10-fold in the buffer and allowed to react at 4°C. The reaction was quenched at various time points with excess glycine. Reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting.RESULTSPreparation of the Isolated Gap Junction OligomersConditions for dissociating the isolated gap junction membranes into oligomeric units were adapted from Stauffer et al.(19Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), using LDAO as the detergent. Oligomers were then isolated by gel filtration on either HPLC or FPLC systems. Buffer conditions were slightly different for HPLC and FPLC since restrictions due to the chemical nature of the silica matrix of the HPLC column required the sample pH to be reduced before chromatography on this system. The elution volume, Ve, of gap junction complexes isolated under these conditions was determined by examining electron micrographs of negatively stained aliquots of the eluant. Aliquots containing gap junction oligomers were identified by the appearance of 70-80 Å circular structures containing a central 15-20-Å electron-dense center (i.e. 70-80 Å diameter “doughnuts”) (Fig. 1B); structures which are similar to those observed in electron micrographs of isolated gap junction plaques (Fig. 1A). The presence of β1 protein in these samples was confirmed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots indicated that β2 protein was present also in the samples before injection (but, relative to β1 protein, at much lower concentrations). This protein was also detected in the FPLC eluant but not in the HPLC eluant. The β2 protein was observed to co-elute with β1 protein (Fig. 2). The absence of detectable β2 protein in the HPLC eluant was probably due to less material being loaded on the HPLC column resulting in dilution below the detection limit during chromatography.Figure 2:Immunoblots of fractions from gel filtration of detergent-solubilized gap junctions. 1-1.5 mg of protein were applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column and eluted at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were treated with antibodies to β1 liver connexins or β2 liver connexins.

The partition coefficient, Kd, of a species is defined as(33Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3237-3238Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) : Kd=(Ve-V0/(Vt-Vo)(Eq. 1) where Vo is the void volume of the column and Vt is the total volume of the column. In these studies, the Vo was 5.77 ± 0.15 ml as measured with blue dextran, and the Vt was 18.19 ± 0.65 ml by salt elution. Le Maire et al.(34le Maire M. Ghazi A. Martin M. Brochard F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have shown that for HPLC gels in general, and TSK3000 SW columns in particular, the porous media of the gel may best be described as surface fractals, and there exists a linear relationship between ln Rs and ln (1 − Kd). By measuring the Ve (by A277) of various marker proteins of known Rs, the gap junction complex was determined to have an Rs of 41.0 ± 0.6 Å (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Plot of ln Rs versus ln (1 − Kd) as determined by gel filtration on a TSK3000 SW column. The marker proteins used with their corresponding Rs values (in A) were myoglobin, 18.9, malate dehydrogenase, 35.1, lactate dehydrogenase, 42.0, ferritin, 63.0, and β-galactosidase, 68.6(23le Maire M.

The composition of the fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE of the markers and by electron microscopy, and confirmed by immunoblotting, as described above, for the solubilized gap junctions. It was assumed that detergent binding is equivalent in H2O and D2O; this assumption results in less than 10% error in the calculated molecular weight of other membrane proteins(35Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5459-5469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of the s20,w calculated from H20 and D20 gradients (8.76 and 8.74 s, respectively) indicate that this is a valid assumption. The sedimentation coefficients for the markers and the gap junctions were determined by measuring the half-distance of migration, ravg, and from the relationship: sT,m(avg)=(r-ro)/ω2ravgt(Eq. 2) The linearity of the gradients was confirmed by measurement of the refractive indices of the fractions. The density, ρ, at any point in the gradient was determined by interpolation of the measured density at the top and bottom of the gradients. The average viscosity, η, experienced by the marker proteins, was determined from the relationship: ηT,m(avg)=(s20,w/sT,m(1-υρT,m(avg)/1-υρ20,w)(Eq. 3) The average viscosity experienced by the gap junction complex in each gradient was interpolated from linear plots of ηavg for the markers versus gradient fraction. The partial specific volume of the complex, v, can then be calculated: υ=(sHηH/sDηD-1)/(ρD(avg)(sHηH/SDηD)-ρH(avg)(Eq. 4) and is reported in Table 1. The sedimentation coefficient corrected to water at 20°C was then determined from both the H2O and D2O gradients since: s20,w=sm(ηm/eta20,ω)(1-υρ20,ω/1-υρH)(Eq. 5) These values are reported in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Using this information, along with the calculated Rsfrom gel filtration, we can then determine the molecular weight of the complex: Mr=s20,wη20,w6πNRs/(1-υρ20,w(Eq. 6) and the frictional ratio from: f/f0=Rs(4πN/3Mrυ)1/3(Eq. 7) These values are reported in Table 1.To determine the molecular weight of the protein alone, we can use the relationship that vcomplex=vPfP+vFfP(Eq. 8) where fP and fD are the fractional weight composition of protein and detergent, respectively; v for LDAO is 1.112 ml/g and vP was calculated from the amino acid composition to be 0.748 ml/g(37Reynolds J.A. McCaslin D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).CD SpectroscopyThe secondary structures of the isolated gap junction oligomers and the gap junction membranes may be directly compared by CD spectroscopy, since the lipid and detergent molecules are not optically active in the low UV range. Artifacts caused by differential scattering (38Schneider A.S. Harmartz D. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4158-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and absorption flattening (39Gordon D.J. Holzworth G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have been shown to be negligible in sonicated gap junction plaques(22Cascio M. Gogol E. Wallace B.A. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2358-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contamination of the samples by collagen was corrected by subtraction of the calculated spectral contribution of collagen to the samples (22Cascio M. Gogol E. Wallace B.A. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2358-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No collagen was detected in the samples of isolated solubilized oligomers, but the junction membrane samples contained 2.4-3.7% collagen and were corrected by subtracting the spectral contribution of this contaminant.For soluble proteins, the α-helix content calculated from the CD spectrum using a non-linear least-squares fitting of the reference data set (29Chang C.T. Wu C.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) has been shown to strongly correlate with the helical content as determined by x-ray crystallography. This type of analysis has also been successful in describing the helix content of two membrane-associated polypeptides, bacteriorhodopsin (40Mao D. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2667-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and crambin (41Wallace B.A. Kohl N. Teeter M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discussion of the experimentally determined secondary structure will focus primarily on the α-helix content since it is not possible to determine other secondary structures with high reliability by this technique.The averaged CD spectrum of the isolated oligomers was similar, but not superimposable, to that of the intact gap junction plaques (Fig. 4) and appeared to be relatively red-shifted (e.g. the large positive peak at low wavelength, which is indicative of helix-content, appeared red-shifted 2.0 nm relative to that of the membrane-bound sample). Analysis of the membrane plaques indicated that there was 52%α-helix content in this protein, consistent with the value determined in previous CD studies(22Cascio M. Gogol E. Wallace B.A. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2358-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated detergent-solubilized oligomers contained 66%α-helix (Table 2).Figure 4:CD spectra of sonicated gap junction patches (A) and solubilized gap junction complexes (B).

Sequence analyses revealed the presence of three open reading frames within 2,350 base pairs, designated as ORF-1, ORF-2, and ORF-3 in order of nucleotide sequence, which encode proteins of 220, 234, and 323 amino acids, respectively.

Prenyltransferases catalyze the fundamental isoprenoid chain elongation to produce prenyl diphosphates with various chain lengths and stereochemistries, which are led to such diverse isoprenoid compounds as steroids, carotenoids, glycosyl carrier lipids, prenyl quinones, and prenyl proteins(1Poulter C.D.

Rab geranylgeranyltransferase from rat brain is a heterodimer, and it separates into two subunits in the presence of high salt concentrations (15Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sdhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ras farnesyltransferase also consists of two nonidentical subunits, but these subunits can be separated from each other only after denaturation with urea or guanidine(16Reiss Y. Seabra M.C.

In order to shed light on the significance of such an unusual two-component system for prenyl diphosphate synthesis and the role of each component in functional expression, we cloned and sequenced the genes encoding the HepPP synthase of Bacillus stearothermophilus. This is the first report of the genes encoding two essential proteins involved in prenyl diphosphate synthesis. [1-14C]Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) (1.95 GBq/mol) was a product of Amersham Corp. Nonlabeled IPP and (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) were synthesized according to the procedure of Davisson et al.(17Davisson V.J. Woodside A.B. Neal T.R. Stremler K.E. Muehlbacher M. Poulter C.D. J.

PCR was performed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 200 μM each dNTPs, 100 pmol of amplification primer pairs (p1/p4, p1/p6, p1/p8, p2/p4, p2/p6, p2/p8, p9/p11, p9/p4, p9/p6, p9/p8, p9/p13, p1/p11, p2/p11, p1/p13, p2/p13, p10/p4, p10/p6, p10/p8, or p10/p13), 1 unit of DNA Polymerase Enhancer (Stratagene), 500 ng of genomic DNA fragments digested with Sau3AI, and 2 units of Taq polymerase. The protocol used was 35 cycles of PCR of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 50°C, and 1 min at 72°C, followed by extension at 72°C for 7 min (Perkin-Elmer TCI thermal cycler). Samples of reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. All DNA products of PCR were purified, subcloned into a pT7Blue T-Vector, and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Genomic DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes. Electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization were performed according to the standard methods(18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The restriction fragments of B. stearothermophilus genomic DNA were fractionated with 0.8% agarose electrophoresis. Approximately 3 kbp of AccI fragments were isolated by electrophoretic elution into a dialysis tube. The AccI fragments were treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and the resulting fragments were ligated to the SmaI site of pUC18, after which Escherichia coli JM109 cells were transformed with the resulting plasmids. Approximately 6,000 transformant colonies were screened by colony lift hybridization for the presence of plasmids bearing the genomic fragment hybridizing to the probe. Candidate colonies that hybridized to the probe were picked from the master plate and plasmid DNA was prepared. The transformed E. coli cells were cultured in 30 ml of L-B medium at 37°C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and then homogenized by sonication according to our procedure for the screening of thermostable prenyl diphosphate synthase activity(20Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 ml, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 25 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NH4Cl, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 25 μM FPP, 0.46 μM [1-14C]IPP (1.95 GBq/mol), and 500 μl of the crude cell-free homogenate to be examined. The incubation was carried out at 55°C for 3 h, and then the reaction mixture was treated with 1-butanol to extract the product of the prenyltransferase reaction. The radioactivity in the butanol extract was measured with an Aloka LSC-1000 liquid scintillation counter. After the enzymatic reaction at 55°C, the radioactive prenyl diphosphate in the reaction mixture was hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohol with potato acid phosphate according to our method reported previously(21Koyama T. Fujii H. Ogura K. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The alcohol was extracted with pentane and analyzed by TLC on reversed phase LKC-18 in a solvent system of acetone/water (19:1). The positions of authentic standards were visualized with iodine vapor, and the distribution of radioactivity was determined by autoradiography. The TLC plates were exposed on a Fuji imaging plate at room temperature for 1 day. The exposed imaging plate was analyzed with a Fuji BAS 2000 bioimage analyzer. The nucleotide sequences was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373A). Computer analysis and comparison of DNA sequence were performed using GENETYX genetic information processing software (Software Development). A HindIII site was introduced at position 220 of pTL6 by site-directed mutagenesis using a mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5’-GGGAAAAAGTAAGCTTGCAAATGTCTAGC-3’ according to the procedure described in our previous paper(22Koyama T. Obata S. Saito K. Takeshita-Koike A. Ogura K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12644-12648Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After deletion of the HindIII fragment (220 bp) of the resulting plasmid, the residual DNA fragment was ligated to give a plasmid designated as pTLM17. After deletion of the SacI (1,027 bp) or the HincII (1,032 bp) fragment from pTL6, the residual DNA fragment was ligated, and the resulting plasmid was designated as pTLD7 or pTLD9, respectively. After deletion of the EcoT14I-ScaI (368 bp) fragment of pTLM17, the residual DNA was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated, and the resulting plasmid was designated as pTLD17, After transformation of E. coli cells with these plasmids, the cells harboring deletion plasmids were examined for production of the thermostable HepPP synthase. The genomic DNA of B. stearothermophilus was chosen for this purpose, because this bacterium contains heat-stable prenyltransferases including HepPP synthase in addition to FPP synthase, whose gene has already been cloned and characterized(20Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In order to obtain possible probes that hybridize genes for prenyltransferases including HepPP synthase, we synthesized nine degenerate oligonucleotide primers of 18-30 bp long designed on the basis of conserved amino acid regions of prenyltransferases. After 19 PCRs using partially digested genomic DNAs of B. stearothermophilus as templates, we obtained 37 clones. These PCR products were cloned into a pT7Blue T-Vector, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Ten clones were found to have the same sequences as fragments of fps gene(20Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but we found that three similar clones of approximately 500 bp had the same sequence encoding a typical prenyltransferase motif, DDXXD. One of the plasmids, pCR64 was used as a probe for subsequent screening of the clones containing the entire coding region of a prenyltransferase other than the FPP synthase of B. stearothermophilus. As the Southern blot analysis with the KpnI-HindIII fragment of pCR64 gave a 3-kbp band in the hybridization pattern of the genomic DNA digested with AccI (data not shown), a genomic library of B. stearothermophilus was constructed with approximately 3-kbp fragments and inserted into the SmaI site of pUC18. E. coli JM109 transformants (>6,000 colonies) were screened by colony hybridization using digoxigenin (DIG, Boehringer Mannheim)-labeled pCR64 fragment as a probe. A clone, pAC2, containing a 2.5-kbp insert, was isolated and sequenced. There were three open reading frames in the same strand of pAC2, and they were designated as ORF-1, ORF-2, and ORF-3 in order of the nucleotide sequence, which encoded proteins of 220, 234, and 323 amino acids, respectively. The protein encoded by ORF-3 contains seven conserved regions, including the two aspartate-rich sequences, LXXDDXXDXXRRG and GXXFQXXDDXXD, which are typical of prenyltransferases(20Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In order to specify the enzyme that is encoded by ORF-3, we transformed, with pAC2, E. coli cells that do not produce HepPP synthase but produce octaprenyl (C40) diphosphate synthase instead. After denaturation of the intrinsic prenyltransferases derived from the host cells by heat treatment, the cell-free homogenate was assayed for heat-stable prenyltransferase. However, no heat-stable prenyltransferase activity was detected in the cell-free homogenate. In order to add an upstream portion to the 2.5-kbp insert in pAC2, another PCR with an M13 primer and an antisense primer of pAC2 (from position 2098 to 2079) was carried out using the genomic library as the template. A 2-kbp clone, pPR2 was obtained and its BamHI fragment was replaced with the corresponding sequence (from position 1975 to 3088). The resulting clone, designated as pTL6, was found to be longer by 423 bp than pAC2 (Fig. 1). After transformation, E. coli JM109 cells harboring pTL6 were homogenized and then heat-treated at 55°C for 60 min. Incubation with the cell-free homogenate gave polyprenyl products extractable with butanol, which were then converted to the corresponding alcohols by acid phosphatase treatment(21Koyama T. Fujii H. Ogura K. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, it is clear that the cells harboring pTL6 express thermostable HepPP synthase, producing HepPP as well as some intermediate shorter-chain prenyl diphosphates.Figure 2:TLC radiochromatogram of the alcohols obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of the products formed by the incubation with the cell-free homogenate of E. coli JM109/pTL6.

However, when an out-of-frame clone with lacZ region in the pUC18 vector was prepared, a slight HepPP synthase activity was detected, indicating that a fusion protein of a lacZ-ORF-1 product might be produced by pAC2 (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence of the 3-kbp insert of pTL6 contains three open reading frames, ORF-1, ORF-2, and ORF-3, which are the same constituents of pAC2. ORF-1 begins with an ATG codon at position 451 and terminates with the TAG codon at position 1110, encoding a 220-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight (Mr) of 24,610. ORF-2 begins with the ATG codon at position 1118 and contains 702 nucleotides encoding a 234-amino acid protein with an Mr of 27,132. ORF-3, beginning with the GTG codon at position 1829, encodes a 323-amino acid protein with an Mr of 36,172. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by the three open reading frames with those for FPP synthases from B. stearothermophilus(20Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that only the ORF-3 protein has a significant level of similarity to the above mentioned prenyltransferases. As shown in Fig. 3, the ORF-3 protein has seven highly conserved regions that are typical of prenyl diphosphate synthases(20Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This protein shows 31.9% similarity to that of the FPP synthase of the same bacterium. The protein deduced from ORF-2 shows 39.1% similarity to an unknown protein deduced from the o-251 gene of E. coli(28Daniels D.L. Plunkett III, G. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In order to specify the real structural genes responsible for the HepPP synthase activity, we prepared several plasmids having DNA inserts with some deletions in pTL6 (Fig. 1) and examined the enzymatic activity in each transformant. As shown in Table 2, neither pTLD7, which had deletion from position 2062 to the end, nor pTLD9, which lacked 582 bp in ORF-1, expressed any thermostable prenyltransferase activity. However, the plasmid pTLD17, from which 367 bp in ORF-2 was lost, showed a significant level of HepPP synthase activity. These results indicate that ORF-1, as well as ORF-3, is essential for the HepPP synthase activity whereas ORF-2 is not essential.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab HepPP synthase is one of the three prenyl diphosphate synthases in B. stearothermophilus. It produces the precursor of the respiratory quinone side chain in this bacterium(29Hess A. Hollnder R. Mannheim W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 115: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The equivalent from B. subtilis and the HexPP synthase from M. luteus B-P 26 (9Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14610-14612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yoshida I. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6840-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Yoshida I. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) are unique in that each of them comprises two dissociable protein components, neither of which shows any enzyme activity(9Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14610-14612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By taking advantage of the thermostability of B. stearothermophilus enzyme and the lack of HepPP synthase in E. coli, we succeeded in the first identification of the genes encoding such two components that constitute a medium-chain polyprenyl diphosphate synthase. On the basis of the data from the deletion experiments, we concluded that both ORF-1 and ORF-3 are essential for the HepPP synthase activity. It is very interesting why this enzyme must take such a two-dissociable component system in contrast to most of the other prenyl diphosphate synthases that are tightly coupled homodimers. In the case of protein farnesyltransferase and protein geranylgeranyltransferase, these transferases are heterodimers that share a common α subunit in association with different β subunits(30Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Glodstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that α- and β subunits bind a prenyl diphosphate and a protein substrate, respectively(16Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10672-10677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may raise the possibility that the two components of HepPP synthase are responsible for the respective bindings for the prenyl donor (allylic diphosphate) and for the acceptor (IPP). However, this possibility seems unlikely for the following reasons. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of ORF-3 with those of other prenyl diphosphate synthases revealed that it has conserved regions that involve the two putative binding sites for the allylic and homoallylic substrates(31Ashby M.N. Spear D.H. Edwards P.A. Attie A. Molecular Biology of Atherosclerosis: Twentieth Steenbock Symposium. Elsevier, New York1990: 27-34Google Scholar). In contrast, the protein encoded by ORF-1 has no such similarity, nor did we find similar protein entries in protein data bases. Therefore, it seems likely that the protein encoded by ORF-3 carries substantial sites for substrate binding and catalysis, whereas the protein by ORF-1 plays an auxiliary but essential role in catalytic function. This would be consistent with our previous observations that one of the two components of M. luteus HexPP synthase or B. subtilis HepPP synthase is more heat-stable than the other. We have also demonstrated that the heat-stable components of these enzymes are so specific for their own partners that one cannot substitute for the other(13Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the case of long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases, which are stimulated by commonly effective protein factors(26Ohnuma S. Suzuki M. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14792-14797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium-chain- (C30 and C35) and long-chain- (C40, C45, and C50) prenyl diphosphate synthases catalyze quite similar reactions, sharing the starting substrates. The only difference between these two classes of enzyme lies in the chain length of the product. Probably, the C30 and C35 products are amphipathic, whereas the C40 and longer products are too hydrophobic to form micelles in an aqueous phase. Taken together, these observations suggest that the unique constitutions of the medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases are related to their abilities to catalyze the synthesis of amphipathic products from soluble substrates. In experiments with a yeast mutant in coenzyme Q biosynthesis, Ashby and Edwards (27Ashby M.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have isolated a gene from a plasmid containing a wild-type genomic DNA fragment that is able to complement the mutant and restore HexPP synthase activity. They have also shown that this gene encodes a 473-amino acid protein having highly conserved domains characteristic of prenyl diphosphate synthases as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, this protein seems to correspond to the product of ORF-3 in this report. However, it is not known whether the yeast 473 amino-acid protein acts as HexPP synthase by itself or in association with another gene product similar to the ORF-1 protein. If the latter is the case, the mutant described above must be deficient in one of the two components of HexPP synthase. Similar to this is the case of the yeast mutant dpr1/ram1, which lacks protein: farnesyltransferase activity(32Schafter W.R. Trueblood C.E. Yang C.-C. Mayer M.P. Rosenberg S. Poulter C.D. Kim S.-H. Rine J. Science. 1990; 249: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The wild-type DPR1/RAM1 gene product expressed in E. coli is catalytically inactive but becomes active when it is mixed with an extract of the dpr1/ram1 cells, suggesting that DPR1/RAM1 encodes one of the two subunits of this transferase. It is interesting to learn whether dissociable heterodimeric systems are common to the medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Overproduction and purification of each component are in progress for further exploring the significance and mechanistic enzymology of this unusual two-component system. We are grateful to Takuya Toyokawa and Zhang Yuanwei for cooperation in the analysis of the enzymatic activities."

In contrast, cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) only slowly oxidizes small molecules but very efficiently oxidizes cytochrome c, a 12-kDa protein that is its natural substrate(4Bosshard H.R. Anni H.

The first step of the normal catalytic sequence is reaction of the heme prosthetic group of the peroxidase with H2O2 to give a two-electron oxidized species known as Compound I(2Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 89-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dunford H.B. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-24Google Scholar). Compound I is reduced to Compound II by a substrate-derived electron and to the resting ferric state by a second electron. All known hemoprotein peroxidases have a common Compound II structure in which the single oxidation equivalent is stored as a ferryl (FeIV = O) species(1Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar, 2Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 89-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same ferryl moiety is present in Compound I, but there are two possible sites for the location of the second oxidation equivalent. Diverse spectroscopic and physical measurements, including magnetic circular dichroism, electron nuclear double resonance, magnetic susceptibility, and resonance Raman spectroscopy, clearly establish that the second oxidation equivalent in Compound I of HRP is stored as a porphyrin radical cation(2Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 89-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HRP Compound I structure therefore can be represented as [Por+•FeIV = O]. In contrast, the second oxidation equivalent in the case of CcP is stored as an unpaired electron on a tryptophan residue (Trp191) located on the proximal side of the heme(9Sivaraja M. Goodin D.B. Smith M. Hoffman B.M. Science. 1989; 245: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The CcP Compound I structure therefore can be represented as [Prot+•FeIV = O]. Some of the structural features that promote the formation of a protein radical in CcP have been determined(10Houseman A.L.P. Doan P.E. Goodin D.B. Hoffman B.M.

An aromatic residue adjacent to the 1- and 8-methyl groups of the heme was initially identified by such arguments as Tyr185(20Thanabal V. de Ropp J.S. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem.

( 2A gene coding for the Y185F mutant of HRP has been constructed and expressed in the baculovirus/S. frugiperda system described here and has been found to have spectroscopic and catalytic properties indistinguishable from those of the wild type enzyme (V. Miller and P. R. Ortiz de Montellano, unpublished results). ) We have expressed a synthetic HRP gene in a baculovirus/insect cell system and are carrying out site-specific mutagenesis studies of the structure and function of this enzyme(24Hartmann C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Ozaki S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem.

We demonstrate here that reaction of H2O2 with the F172Y mutant of HRP, in which a tyrosine has been introduced into the structure near the heme group, initially yields a normal Compound I intermediate. The porphyrin radical cation of this Compound I, however, oxidizes the protein to give a CcP-like Compound I in which the second oxidation equivalent is present as a protein radical. The results demonstrate that one of the parameters that determine whether the second oxidation equivalent is on the porphyrin or the protein is the presence or absence of oxidizable residues near the heme. Guaiacol was purchased from Sigma. HRP (grade 1) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA) or Boehringer Mannheim. S Fast Flow and Q Fast Flow resins were from Pharmacia. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the University of California, San Francisco, Biomolecular Resource Center using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer. Heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and Escherichia coli strain DH5α were obtained from the University of California, San Francisco, Cell Culture Facility. DNA miniprep columns were from Promega (Madison, WI). All insect cell culture media contained 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 100 units/ml penicillin “G.” Guaiacol peroxidation and thioanisole sulfoxidation activities were assayed as reported elsewhere (26Ozaki S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The F172Y mutant gene was constructed by cassette mutagenesis between the BspEI and BstEII restriction sites of a synthetic HRP gene (British Biotechnologies, Ltd.). The cassette sequence was identical to the gene sequence except it contained the tyrosine codon TAC at amino acid position 172: 5′−CC GGA GGA CAC ACA TAC GGA AAG AAC CAG TGT AGG TTC ATC ATG GATT CCT GTG TGT ATG CCT TTC TTG GTC ACA TCC AAG TAG TAC CTA AGG CTC TAC AAT TTC AGC AAC ACT GG-3′TCC GAG ATG TTA AAG TCG TTG TGA CCC AAT G An equal molar mixture of oligonucleotides (55 pmol) in ligation buffer (66 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 6.6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mM ATP) was annealed by heating at 100°C for 3 min and cooling slowly to room temperature over a period of 1 h. The plasmid pUC-HRP containing the synthetic gene cloned into pUC19 was digested with BspEI and BstEII, gel purified, and ligated with the annealed cassette. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α to ampicillin resistance. Positive clones were screened by restriction digests and verified by DNA sequencing. A 762-base pair SacI/NcoI fragment of the HRP gene containing the mutation was then exchanged into the baculovirus vector pVLHRP2 (24Hartmann C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) which contains the same HRP gene as well as the HRP 5’-leader sequence. Positive clones were identified by restriction digestion. The purified plasmid DNA from one clone (pVLHRPF172Y) was used for HRP gene incorporation into baculovirus. Recombinant virus was generated in Sf9 cells growing in Hink's TNM-FH insect tissue culture media (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum using the BaculoGold® transfection kit (Pharmingen, San Diego). Plaque-purified virus was used to infect cell monolayers in 3 ml of media. After 3 days the medium was removed and used as first passage virus stock (pass 1 stock). Genomic viral DNA from 0.75 ml of this media was screened for the presence of HRP gene insertion using polymerase chain reaction procedures and primers from Invitrogen. HRP gene insertion was verified by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment. A 400-μl aliquot of pass 1 stock was then used to infect 1 × 108 cells in a 100-ml culture. After 4 days of growth, the medium was harvested and used for large scale expression after the viral titer had been determined. Recombinant enzyme was expressed using Trichoplusia ni egg homogenate (HighFive®) cells (Invitrogen) growing in shaker flasks at 27°C with Sf-900 II SFM serum-free insect cell media (Life Technologies Inc.). Pass 2 stock was added to 300 ml of T. ni cells (~2 × 106 cells/ml) in a Fernbach culture flask to give a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 1 h at 27°C the volume was increased to 800 ml with serum-free media. Two h later, 10 ml of a 500 μM hemin solution was added to the expression flask. The hemin solution was made by dissolving 3.3 mg of hemin in 10 ml of 10 mM NaOH. Immediately after the hemin was dissolved, the solution was carefully neutralized with a few drops of 0.5 N HCl. The hemin solution was filter sterilized before addition to the expression flask. Three days post-infection another 10 ml of hemin solution was added to the expression flask. The media was harvested 4-6 days post-infection. Following removal of the cells by centrifugation, the media was concentrated to ~50 ml using a spiral channel ultrafiltration apparatus (YM-10 membrane, Amicon, Beverley, MA). The crude concentrated media was dialyzed against 10 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0, and applied to a column of S Fast Flow (1.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with 10 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0, buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer (50 ml) and then eluted with 20 mM NaCl in NaOAc buffer. The fractions containing peroxidase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5, buffer. The protein was then washed through a small column (1.5 × 2 cm) of Q Fast Flow. HRP does not bind to anion-exchange media under these conditions, but the remaining impurities bound tightly. The pure enzyme was stored at −70°C and lyophilized when higher concentrations of enzyme were desired. Stopped-flow experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics Sequential DX-17 MV stopped-flow instrument. The sample handling unit was fitted with two drive syringes mounted inside a thermostated-bath compartment to allow for variable temperature experimentation. A 1.0-cm path-length cell was employed. First- and second-order curve fitting and rate constants were calculated from the average of at least five traces, using a Marquardt algorithm based on a routine “curfit”(27Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar, 28Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 235-240Google Scholar). The absorption spectra at indicated time points were calculated with software provided by Applied Photophysics. This consisted of slicing the appropriate time points across a series of kinetic traces at different wavelengths and then splining the points of a specific time group(29Detty M.R. Friedman A.E. McMillan M. Organometallics. 1994; 13: 3338-3345Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The concentrations of HRP and the F172Y HRP mutant in these studies were between 1 × 10-6 and 5 × 10-7M. The concentrations were calculated assuming the molar absorptivity for the F172Y mutant is the same as that of native HRP (ϵ = 1.02 × 105M−1 s−1). The concentration of H2O2 was either 10-fold that of either HRP or F172Y HRP for pseudo-first-order conditions (i.e. k1 for HRP → Compound I), or the concentration was matched 1:1 to H2O2-enzyme for second-order experiments for k1 and the subsequent measurement of k2 (i.e. for the decay of Compound I). All experiments involving the formation of Compound I were followed at 402 nm, the largest absorbance change for this transition. All experiments involving the conversion of Compound I to final product were followed at 420 nm (greatest ΔA). All solutions contained 100 mM KCl buffered at a concentration of 25 mM with either acetate, <pH 6, phosphate, pH 6-8, or Tris-OH, >pH 8. To solutions at pH 5.47, 7.1, and 8.56, Ca2+ (5.0 mM) was added to ensure that the calcium sites were filled. A 1.3-fold molar excess of H2O2 was added to solutions of either HRP (313 μM) or F172Y HRP (329 μM) in 25 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mM KCl and, for some experiments, 5 mM Ca2+. Within less than 30 s, the samples were transferred to EPR tubes and were quickly frozen to 77 K. After the EPR spectra were recorded, the samples were quickly thawed to 298 K, allowed to stand for 5 min, and refrozen to 77 K before again recording their EPR spectra. Finally, the samples were thawed to 298 K for 30 min before refreezing and recording the final set of EPR spectra. EPR spectra were recorded in 3 mm O.D. quartz tubes on a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer at X-band using 100 KHz field modulation. Low temperature control was achieved by an Air Products LTR-3 Helitran liquid helium transfer line and cryostat. Temperatures below 4 K were achieved by maintaining a measured vacuum above the helium flow. Background spectra on blank samples collected under identical conditions were subtracted from each spectrum. EPR simulations were performed using the program qpowder (30Belford R.L. Nilges M.J. EPR Symposium: 21st Rocky Mountain Conference Denver, CO. 1979Google Scholar) on a 486/66 DX2 personal computer. Alignment of the HRP amino acid sequence with the sequences of three peroxidases for which crystal structures are available indicates that Phe172 corresponds to Leu176 in CcP, Val178 in LiP, and Leu185 in the A. rhamosus peroxidase (31Baunsgard L. Dalb H. Houen G. Rasmussen E.M. Welinder K.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These residues are located in all three crystal structures on the proximal side of the heme close to pyrrole ring C (Fig. 1)(13Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol.

The sequence and structural relationships between HRP and the three crystalline peroxidases suggest that Phe172 occupies a similar site in the HRP structure. We have therefore chosen to replace Phe172 with a tyrosine residue to determine the consequences of placing a structurally similar but more oxidizable residue close to the heme group. It should be noted that the residue equivalent to Phe172 in the peroxidase crystal structures does not interact directly with the proximal histidine iron ligand or with its hydrogen bonding network, so that a mutation of Phe172 should not directly influence the axial ligand-heme interaction(13Finzel B.C.

A gene coding for the F172Y HRP mutant was constructed by cassette mutagenesis between the BspEI and BstEII restriction sites of a commercially available HRP gene. The cassette sequence was identical to the gene sequence except for substitution of the tyrosine codon TAC for the phenylalanine codon at position 172. A 762-base pair SacI/NcoI fragment of the HRP gene encompassing the mutated region was then placed into the previously constructed baculovirus vector pVLHRP2(24Hartmann C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This vector contains the HRP gene and a 5’-leader sequence that directs excretion of the protein into the medium. The mutated vector was incorporated into baculovirus and was then used to express the F172Y HRP protein. Viral stocks were obtained by expressing the mutant baculovirus in Sf9 cells, but large scale protein expression was done in shaker flasks with HighFive® cells. The use of serum-free media in the expression system simplified protein purification. The protein was purified to homogeneity from baculovirus infected HighFive® cell culture media by ion exchange chromatography (Table 1). The concentrated culture medium was applied to a long thin column of the cation-exchanger S Fast Flow at pH 5.0. Although binding of the protein to the column is not optimal at this pH, F172Y HRP denatures at lower pH values. Following elution with a small amount of NaCl (20 mM), the active fractions were combined, equilibrated into pH 7.0 Tris buffer, and passed through a plug of the anion-exchanger Q Fast Flow. HRP does not bind to anion exchangers at neutral pH, but the remaining impurities bind strongly and are easily removed. Ca2+ was added to the neutral Tris buffer to help stabilize the protein(32Haschke R.H. Friedhoff J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The F172Y HRP mutant was thus obtained as a pure protein, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in a yield of 15 mg/liter of culture (Fig. 2). The Rz value of the purified protein was 2.9, and its specific activity, determined by guaiacol oxidation, was 86 μmol min−1 mg−1. The Rz value suggests that a small fraction of the protein does not contain a heme prosthetic group because the Rz value for pure, native HRP is between 3 and 3.4 (3Dunford H.B. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-24Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for the oxidation of guaiacol by recombinant wild type HRP and the F172Y mutant are similar: HRP, Km = 7.63 mM, Vmax = 0.71 nmol s−1 pmol−1; F172Y, Km = 2.62 mM, Vmax = 0.41 nmol s−1 pmol−1. The protein concentrations used for these experiments were based on the Soret absorbance of the catalytically active enzyme. The Vmax for the oxidation of guaiacol by the F172Y mutant is thus approximately half that for the wild type enzyme.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Mutations within the active site of HRP may affect the pH optimum for guaiacol oxidation. The pH profile for guaiacol oxidation was therefore examined by determining the activity of the enzyme in buffers of different pH values adjusted to an ionic strength of 0.1 with NaCl (Fig. 3)(33Stoll V.S. Blanchard J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). No difference in pH profile was found between wild type HRP and the F172Y mutant. The pH optimum is approximately 6.4 for both wild type and F172Y HRP. Stereoselective thioanisole sulfoxidation is catalyzed by native HRP, but the rate and stereoselectivity of the reaction are increased in the F42V mutant(25Ozaki S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4487-4488Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Ozaki S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The stereospecificity of thioanisole sulfoxidation by F172Y HRP was therefore examined to determine if the mutation alters the topology in the vicinity of the ferryl oxygen. However, the enantiomeric excess obtained with F172Y HRP (ee 76%) is similar to that observed with the wild type enzyme (ee 70%). These results suggest that the distal active site pocket is not significantly altered by the F172Y mutation. The spectrum of ferric F172Y HRP is identical to those of the native enzyme and the recombinant wild type protein. The same spectroscopic identity characterizes the ferric cyano complexes of native (λmax 362, 422, 538), recombinant wild type (λmax 362, 422, 538), and F172Y HRP (λmax 362, 422, 540). Reaction of the F172Y HRP mutant with one equivalent of H2O2 initially gives a Compound I spectrum that changes with time to a Compound II-like spectrum (Fig. 4). Similar treatment of native HRP gives a Compound I spectrum that does not decay significantly within 1 h(42Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of Compound I formation for F172Y as determined by stopped flow methods was k1 = 1.6 × 107M−1 s−1 at both pH 6 (100 mM phosphate buffer) and pH 8 (50 mM Tris buffer, 100 mM KCl). This value is the same as those reported in the literature for native HRP (k1 = 1.0 to 2.0 × 107M−1 s−1)(35Davies D.M. Jones P. Mantle D. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Dolman D. Newell G.A. Thurlow M.D. Dunford H.B. Can. J.

This was determined using the equation rate1 = kobs[HRP] where kobs = k1[H2O2] under pseudo-first-order conditions. In contrast to native HRP which has a stable Compound I, ( 3Compound I formed from native HRP is stable for hours in the absence of reducing agents. )Compound I formed from F172Y decays and the decay exhibits a modest pH dependence (Fig. 5). At pH 7, the rate of decay in the absence of added substrate is 1.01 s−1 ([F172Y] = 5.0 × 10-7M) and, as shown by a linear dependence of rate2 on the concentration of F172Y (not shown), follows the equation rate2 = k2[F172Y Compound I]. The same value for the rate is obtained in the presence or absence of 5.0 mM Ca2+. This suggests either"

The partial amino acid sequences determined for five tryptic peptides from the rat testis enzyme prompted us to search for similar sequences in the molecular biology data banks. Although we found no protein with similar sequences, the deduced amino acid sequence of one open reading frame (387 amino acids) of the gene YHR068w in Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VIII (AC:U00061) (16Johnston M. Andrews S. Brinkman R. Cooper J. Ding H. Dover J. Du Z. Favello A. Fulton L. Gattung S. Geisel C. Kirsten J. Kucaba T. Hillier L. Jier M. Johnston L. Langston Y. Latreille P. Louis E.J. Macri C.

In an effort to determine if the product of this gene corresponds to a yeast deoxyhypusine synthase, we obtained from S. cerevisiae cDNA by PCR a 1.17-kilobase pair cDNA with the identical nucleotide sequences as that of the entire YHR068w coding region. The expression, purification, and characterization of the yeast recombinant enzyme are the subject of this paper.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[1,8-3H]Spermidine • HCl (15 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the Midland Certified Reagent Company. pET-11a expression vector and the host Escherichia coli B strain BL21(DE3) were from Novagen; Vent polymerase and T4 DNA ligase from New England Biolabs; restriction enzymes from Life Technologies, Inc.; precast polyacrylamide gels and wide range protein standards (Mark 12) from Novex; ec-eIF-5A, purified from E. coli lysates after overexpression of the human eIF-5A cDNA as described(13Joe Y.A.

A typical reaction mixture contained, in total volumes of 20 μl, 0.2 M glycine NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 mg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM NAD, 7 μM [1,8-3H]spermidine, 10 μM ec-eIF-5A, and enzyme. Incubations were at 37°C for 60 min. The radioactivity of [3H]deoxyhypusine was measured after its ion exchange chromatographic separation from the hydrolyzed protein fraction essentially as described earlier(17Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 458-462Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 pmol of deoxyhypusine h-1.Construction of a Plasmid Encoding Full-length Yeast Deoxyhypusine Synthase and Expression in E. coliOn the basis of the nucleotide sequence in the open reading frame of the gene YHR068w in S. cerevisiae chromosome VIII, primers for PCR representing the 5’-end (43-mer, CTTCCAGTATGCTCATATGTCCGATATCAACGAAAAACTCCCA) and the 3’-end region (45-mer, CTTCCAGTATGGATCCTCAATTCTTAACTTTTTTGATTGGTTTAC) were synthesized with a built-in NdeI site (5’-end primer) and a BamHI site (3’-end primer) (underlined) to facilitate cloning into the expression vector pET-11a. PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using yeast Quick Clone cDNA (Clontech) as a template. Conditions for PCR were: denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, extension reaction at 72°C for 1.5 min for 35 cycles, and a final extension reaction at 72°C for 10 min. Agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of the PCR product showed only one band of ~1.2 kilobase pair. The PCR product was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI, ligated to the insertion site of the vector pET-11a, and introduced into the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli. The cDNA clones containing an insert of the correct size were sequenced by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination procedure with Sequenase (version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) using double-stranded DNA as a template. The recombinant strains obtained by transformation were grown in Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cell density in the culture reached an OD of 0.6 at 600 nm, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 5 min) after 4 h of induction.Purification of S. cerevisiae Deoxyhypusine Synthase Expressed in BL21(DE3) StrainThe induced E. coli cells (14 g) were suspended in 150 ml of Buffer A (20 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and thrice sonicated for a 1-min interval at a 70-watts setting, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a fast flow Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (5 × 6 cm) previously equilibrated with Buffer A, the column was washed with Buffer A until the effluent showed A280 < 0.1, and a 1-liter linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in Buffer A was applied. The fractions containing enzyme activity, eluting between 0.23 and 0.27 M NaCl, were pooled, concentrated to ~4.0 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon), applied to a Bio-Gel A 0.5-m (200-400 mesh, Bio-Rad) column (2.5 × 96 cm) previously equilibrated with Buffer B (0.05 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.07 M NaCl), and eluted with Buffer B. The fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against Buffer A for 1 h, and applied to a Mono Q (5/5) column. The adsorbed enzyme was eluted with a 90-ml linear gradient of 0.1-0.5 M NaCl in Buffer A. PAGE analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme showed a single band in the presence or absence of SDS.Preparation of the Yeast Recombinant eIF-5A Precursors, ec-eIF-5Aa and ec-eIF-5AbS. cerevisiae contains two eIF-5A genes, TIF51A and TIF51B(10Schnier J. Schwelberger H. Smit-McBride Z. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The products of these two genes, ec-eIF-5Aa and ec-eIF-5Ab, respectively, were produced by a method similar to that described above for preparation of the recombinant deoxyhypusine synthase. The cDNA for each of the yeast eIF-5A precursors was obtained by PCR amplification of Quick Clone S. cerevisiae cDNA (Clontech) using a set of two primers containing the underlined NdeI site and BamHI site as follows: 5’-end primer (CTTCCAGTATGCTCATATGTCTGACGAAGAACATACCTTTGAAACTG) and 3’-end primer (CTTCCAGTATGGATCCTTAATCGGTTCTAGCAGCTTCCTTGAAG) for the eIF-5Aa cDNA and 5’-end primer (CTTCCAGTATGCTCATATGTCTGACGAAGAACACACCTTTGAAAATG) and the 3’-end primer (CTTCCAGTATGGATCCCTAATCAGATCTTGGAGCTTCCTTGAAG) for the eIF-5Ab cDNA, respectively. The PCR product after cleavage with NdeI and BamHI was inserted into the vector pET-11a and used for transformation of BL21(DE3) cells. Expression of the eIF-5A precursor proteins in the selected transformants was induced with IPTG (1 mM) for 4 h as described above. The lysate supernatant of IPTG-induced cells (~14 g of packed cells from a 10-liter culture) was applied to a fast flow S-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column (5 × 4 cm) equilibrated with Buffer C (50 mM Tris acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a wash of the column with 200 ml of Buffer C containing 0.25 M KCl, the eIF-5A precursor proteins were eluted with Buffer C containing 1 M KCl. The fractions containing the eIF-5A precursors were pooled. After ammonium sulfate fractionation (40-75% saturation) of this pool and subsequent dialysis, ~20 mg of each of the eIF-5A precursor proteins was obtained in >90% purity. In the transformant containing yeast eIF-5Aa cDNA, two forms of the eIF-5A precursor protein, exhibiting apparent molecular masses of 21 and 19 kDa, respectively, were detected on SDS-PAGE. The 19-kDa form, presumably generated by proteolytic cleavage of a 10-amino-acid fragment of the intact protein(18Wohl T. Klier H. Ammer H. Lottspeich F. Magdolen V. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), copurified with the intact form upon ion exchange chromatography on an S-Sepharose or Mono-Q column (data not shown). From the recombinant strain transformed with yeast eIF-5Ab cDNA, one form of eIF-5A precursor with an apparent molecular mass of ~20 kDa was isolated.Other MethodsMatrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry was carried out using a Kratos Kompact MALDI-3 spectrometer (Kratos, Ltd., Manchester, UK). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed at 20°C with a 5-mm column height of sample (0.34 mg/ml yeast enzyme) using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge.RESULTSThe deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame of the yeast YHR068w gene (16Johnston M.

There is a remarkable identity between P5 and residues 319-332 of the yeast YHR068w gene product. By making the reasonable assumption that P2 and P3 were originally joined by lysine in the rat enzyme, a good match can be made for this extended peptide. The other two peptides do not show as good a fit. Using primers based on the nucleotide sequence of the yeast gene, PCR product was observed as a single band after amplification of Quick Clone S. cerevisiae cDNA (Clontech). Two independent clones were found to have nucleotide sequences (1,161 bases) identical to that deposited in the GenBank for this gene, suggesting that we had obtained a full-length YHR068w cDNA, encoding a polypeptide of 387 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 42,892 Da. The cDNA clone, tentatively identified as the cDNA for a yeast deoxyhypusine synthase, was expressed in E. coli using pET-11a plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2A, deoxyhypusine synthase activity was detected in the cell lysates and increased in a time-dependent manner up to 4 h after induction by IPTG. SDS-PAGE of the cell lysates showed that a 43-kDa polypeptide was overexpressed (Fig. 2B), in correspondence with the increase in enzyme activity. At 4 h, this polypeptide amounted to ~20% of the total soluble protein of the lysate.Figure 1:Deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame of YHR068w (AC:U00061) (top line) and alignment of five tryptic peptides from rat testis deoxyhypusine synthase (second line, underlined).

Samples of cells were removed after induction with IPTG for 1, 2, and 4 h. The cells in each sample were lysed, and a portion containing ~0.1 μg of protein was analyzed for deoxyhypusine synthase activity (A); another portion containing ~10 μg of protein was used for SDS-PAGE on 10% gel to follow the expression of recombinant 43-kDa polypeptide (B). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The 43-kDa protein is denoted by the arrowhead on the right.

A fast flow Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatographic step of the cell lysate supernatant fraction allowed ~3-fold purification with 90% recovery of total enzyme activity. Upon size exclusion chromatography (Step 3), the enzyme (~90% purity) eluted in a single symmetrical peak (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the peak fractions by PAGE under non-denaturing conditions showed correspondence between the staining intensity of the major band and enzyme activity (Fig. 3B). Upon SDS-PAGE of the same fractions after their treatment with SDS and dithiothreitol, a predominant band at 43 kDa corresponded with the enzyme activity (Fig. 3C). Minor impurities from the gel filtration step were removed in the final step of purification, ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q (5/5) column (Table 1, Step 4), as evidenced by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3D). The overall protocol yielded pure yeast recombinant deoxyhypusine synthase with an average recovery of ~50% and a specific activity of 0.7-1.1 × 106 units/mg of protein (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 3:Size exclusion chromatography and PAGE of the yeast recombinant deoxyhypusine synthase.

Its specific enzymatic activity is comparable with that of the deoxyhypusine synthase purified from rat testis (0.8 × 106 units/mg of protein)(15Wolff E.C. Lee Y.B. Chung S.I. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8660-8666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus this gene product is defined as a deoxyhypusine synthase. Like the rat enzyme, the yeast recombinant enzyme displays a strict specificity for NAD. NADP, FAD, and FMN cannot substitute for NAD (data not shown). Its requirement for the precursor protein is also specific. No [3H]deoxyhypusine was formed in any E. coli cytosol protein or in albumin after incubation with enzyme, [3H]spermidine, and NAD in the absence of the eIF-5A precursor protein. However, the yeast enzyme recognized the eIF-5A precursor proteins from yeast and other species (Fig. 4). The human eIF-5A precursor protein and the two eIF-5A precursors from CHO cells, PI and PII(19Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18531-18535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were modified by the yeast enzyme as were the yeast precursor proteins (Fig. 4A). In the reaction mixture containing [3H]spermidine, no significant difference was observed in the degree of labeling of the two bands of yeast ec-eIF-5Aa proteins and the yeast ec-eIF-5Ab protein (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, when the same panel of protein substrates was tested with the rat testis enzyme (Fig. 4B), labeling also occurred in all cases but was much weaker with the precursor proteins from CHO cells than with the human or the yeast precursors. Table 2 lists the kinetic constants of the yeast enzyme for the three substrates, spermidine, NAD, and eIF-5A precursor, obtained using three different eIF-5A precursors. The kinetic parameters for spermidine and NAD do not appear to vary significantly whether the protein substrate used was human or either of the yeast proteins. When the variable substrate was eIF-5A precursor, the Km and V values for the two yeast proteins were found to be similar, in accordance with the results of Fig. 4A. Upon comparison of these kinetic parameters with those of the rat enzyme(5Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the most striking difference observed is the ~20-fold higher value of Km for NAD with the yeast enzyme. In the absence of the protein substrates, the yeast recombinant enzyme catalyzes the NAD-dependent hydrolysis of spermidine to 1,3-diaminopropane and Δ1-pyrroline, as has been shown to occur with the rat testis enzyme(5Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4:Modification of eIF-5A precursor proteins from several species by deoxyhypusine synthases from yeast and rat. The deoxyhypusine synthase reaction was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that either the yeast enzyme (A, ~0.2 μg) or the rat enzyme (B, ~0.2 μg) and the substrate proteins (~2 μg) from three species, yeast, human, and CHO cells, were used in the assay. One portion (15 μl) of the reaction mixture (total of 20 μl) was used for SDS-PAGE, and the other portion (5 μl) was used for determination of [3H]deoxyhypusine formed. The amounts of radioactivity of [3H]deoxyhypusine in the samples were: panel A, lane 2, 44,922 cpm; lane 3, 52,440 cpm; lane 4, 49,248 cpm; lane 5, 22,068 cpm; lane 6, 45,966 cpm; panel B, lane 2, 71,100 cpm; lane 3, 86,745 cpm; lane 4, 92,175 cpm; lane 5, 9,198 cpm; lane 6, 8,718 cpm.

The enzyme migrated as a single band upon electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 3B) and eluted from an exclusion chromatography column as a single symmetrical peak corresponding to a mass size of 165 kDa (Fig. 3A). Analysis of equilibrium sedimentation data, using a calculated partial specific volume of 0.718 cm2/g, gave a weight average molecular mass of 172,000 ± 4,300 Da. A value of 3.3 × 1016M-3 was obtained for Ka for formation of tetramer and a change of standard free energy ΔG0 = −22.2 ± 0.1 kcal mol-1. The association appears to be strongly cooperative, since no molecular species other than monomer and tetramer could be observed. The mean dissociation constant per monomer may be calculated to be 3.12 × 10-6M. These results indicate that the tetrameric form is the dominant species under physiologic conditions.DISCUSSIONThe identification of YHR068w in S. cerevisiae chromosome VIII as the gene for deoxyhypusine synthase provides the first full amino acid sequence of deoxyhypusine synthase from any source. The selection of this open reading frame as a candidate for a yeast deoxyhypusine synthase gene was made on partial matching with the amino acid sequences of five tryptic peptides from the purified rat testis enzyme(15Wolff E.C. Lee Y.B. Chung S.I. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8660-8666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was in preparation, the purification of a deoxyhypusine synthase from Neurospora crassa was reported(20Tao Y. Chen K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 383-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the four tryptic peptides obtained from the N. crassa enzyme also show a high degree of identity with the yeast enzyme.Deoxyhypusine synthase exhibits a remarkable substrate specificity in its recognition of a single lysine residue of one cellular protein, the eIF-5A precursor. eIF-5A is highly conserved in a wide range of eukaryotic species(1Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. BioFactors. 1993; 4: 95-104PubMed Google Scholar), and the amino acid sequence identity is especially high in the region surrounding the lysine residue that undergoes modification to hypusine(1Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. BioFactors. 1993; 4: 95-104PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a large portion of the substrate protein is required for recognition and modification by deoxyhypusine synthase(13Joe Y.A. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25916-25921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the enzymes from rat testis or yeast appear to recognize eIF-5A precursor proteins from other species, even distantly related ones. The experiments of Schwelberger et al. (21Schwelberger H.G. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14018-14025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of Magdolen et al. (11Magdolen V. Klier H. Whl T. Klink F. Hirt H. Hauber J. Lottspeich F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 224: 646-652Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) provide evidence that the eIF-5A precursor proteins from human, slime mold, and alfalfa can be modified in yeast by the endogenous deoxyhypusine synthase and that these heterologous proteins can functionally substitute for the yeast eIF-5A in support of growth of this organism. The present results indeed show effective modification of the yeast substrate proteins, the human eIF-5A precursor, and those from CHO cells in vitro by the yeast enzyme. The high conservation of the amino acid sequence of the eIF-5A precursors from the diverse species may be the basis of the broad species specificity.Yeast contains two forms of eIF-5A, designated eIF-5Aa and eIF-5Ab here, which are derived from two distinct genes TIF51A and TIF51B(10Schnier J. Schwelberger H. Smit-McBride Z. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Although the two genes are reciprocally regulated by oxygen(22Lowry C.V. Weiss J.L. Walthall D.A. Zitomer R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the two proteins share 90% amino acid sequence identity (10Schnier J. Schwelberger H. Smit-McBride Z. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and appear to be functionally indistinguishable in vitro(10Schnier J. Schwelberger H. Smit-McBride Z. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and in vivo(11Magdolen V. Klier H. Whl T. Klink F. Hirt H. Hauber J. Lottspeich F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 224: 646-652Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Schwelberger H.G. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14018-14025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether yeast contains more than one form of deoxyhypusine synthase. Our results, however, show that the recombinant enzyme can modify both of the precursors with nearly equal efficiency. Recently we cloned a full-length cDNA for human deoxyhypusine synthase. ( 2Y. A. Joe, E. C. Wolff, and M. H. Park, submitted for publication. )The deduced amino acid sequences of the human and the yeast enzymes show 58% identity. Thus, conservation of deoxyhypusine synthase, as well as of its substrate protein, may contribute to the maintenance of the specificity of hypusine synthesis and of the functionality of eIF-5A.Despite obvious differences in primary structure between the yeast recombinant and the rat testis enzymes, as well as the failure of a polyclonal antibody to rat enzyme to recognize the yeast enzyme (data not shown), the two enzymes exhibit certain similarities in physical and enzymatic properties. Each appears to exist as a tetramer (molecular mass, 160-170 kDa) of 43-kDa subunits. The sedimentation equilibrium data obtained for the yeast recombinant enzyme is evidence of the tetrameric structure and is consistent with a high affinity of 43-kDa subunits for one another and with the stability of the tetrameric complex. Each enzyme requires NAD for the catalytic reaction; each displays a strict specificity for this nucleotide. They also catalyze a NAD-dependent cleavage of spermidine in the absence of protein substrate. The availability of the yeast cDNA clone and the yeast recombinant enzyme should permit further studies on the structure of this important en-zyme and on the mechanism of the complex reaction that it catalyzes. INTRODUCTIONThe biosynthesis of hypusine (Nϵ-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) occurs in the eIF-5A ( 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-5Aeukaryotic translation initiation factor 5Aec-eIF-5Athe recombinant precursor(s) of eIF-5A, containing lysine in place of hypusine, expressed in E. coli from a cDNA of human eIF-5A gene (ec-eIF-5A) or of the two yeast eIF-5A genes, TIF51A and TIF51B, respectively (yeast ec-eIF-5Aa and yeast ec-eIF-5Ab)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosideCHOChinese hamster ovary. )precursor protein through a unique posttranslational modification (reviewed in (1Park M.H.

In the first step, the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes conversion of a single lysine (Lys50 in the human precursor) to deoxyhypusine (Nϵ-(4-aminobutyl)lysine) by transfer of the butylamine moiety of the polyamine spermidine to the ϵ-amino group of this lysine (2Park M.H.

The partial amino acid sequences determined for five tryptic peptides from the rat testis enzyme prompted us to search for similar sequences in the molecular biology data banks. Although we found no protein with similar sequences, the deduced amino acid sequence of one open reading frame (387 amino acids) of the gene YHR068w in Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VIII (AC:U00061) (16Johnston M.

In an effort to determine if the product of this gene corresponds to a yeast deoxyhypusine synthase, we obtained from S. cerevisiae cDNA by PCR a 1.17-kilobase pair cDNA with the identical nucleotide sequences as that of the entire YHR068w coding region. The expression, purification, and characterization of the yeast recombinant enzyme are the subject of this paper."

https://openalex.org/W1992280669,"S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase catalyzes the formation of AdoMet from ATP and L-methionine with subsequent hydrolysis of the bound tripolyphosphate intermediate. Maximal activity requires the presence of two divalent and one monovalent cation per active site. Recently, the x-ray structure of the Escherichia coli AdoMet synthetase was solved, and the positions of the two Mg2+ binding sites were identified. Based on additional spherical electron density, the K+ binding site was postulated to be a nearby site where the uranyl heavy atom derivative also bound in the crystal. The side chain of glutamate 42 is within ligation distance of the metals. Mutagenesis of glutamate 42 to glutamine (E42QMetK) abolished monovalent cation activation and produced an enzyme that has kinetic properties virtually identical to those of K+-free wild type AdoMet synthetase in both the overall AdoMet synthetase reaction and in the hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate. Thus, there is a ~100-fold decrease in the Vmax for AdoMet synthesis and large increases in the Km values for both substrates. In contrast there is only a 2-fold decrease in Vmax for tripolyphosphate hydrolysis. The uranyl ion, UO22+, is a competitive inhibitor with respect to K+ (Ki = 350 nM) and is the first ion to bind at this site and inhibit the enzyme. The UO22+ inhibition is reversible and tight-binding, and results from UO22+ and not UO22+·ATP. Analogous to K+ activation, UO22+ predominantly inhibits AdoMet formation rather than tripolyphosphate hydrolysis. The kinetic results indicate that UO22+ inhibition is likely to result from interference with productive ATP binding. UO22+ remains a tight-binding inhibitor of the E42Q mutant, which suggests that K+ and UO22+ have different ligation preferences when bound in the monovalent cation binding pocket. The results support the model that glutamate 42 provides ligands to the K+ and has a major role in monovalent cation binding.

Science. 1970; 168: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, the modes and structural basis for monovalent cation activation are not well understood for most of these enzymes. We have studied monovalent cation activation of AdoMet synthetase in an attempt to define the structural mechanisms involved in activation. S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase catalyzes the two sequential reactions shown in Fig. SI(2Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first reaction, AdoMet formation and the second reaction, tripolyphosphate (PPPi) hydrolysis, occur at the same active site. Both steps require divalent metal ions such as Mg2+. Two divalent metal ions bind per subunit (active site) of the tetrameric enzyme from Escherichia coli and both are required for activity(3Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1903-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One monovalent cation, K+ or one of similar size, binds per active site and stimulates the AdoMet formation step up to 100-fold at low substrate concentrations, decreases the Km of ATP (4-fold) and L-methionine (12-fold), but has relatively little effect (2-5-fold) on the rate of the PPPi hydrolysis reaction. The size of the monovalent cation dictates how well it binds to, and activates, AdoMet synthetase. Spectroscopic studies have shown all three metals bind close together in the active site(4Markham G.D. Leyh T.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 599-600Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 205Tl+ NMR studies of the enzyme Tl+ complex suggest that the monovalent metal activator does not coordinate directly to either substrates or products(5Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1507-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic isotope effects indicate that the monovalent cation does not alter the transition state structure, but does enhance the commitment to catalysis of bound ATP(6Markham G.D. Parkin D.W. Mentch F. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5609-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon these results, monovalent cation activation has been proposed to result from subtle alterations in protein conformation(5Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1507-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of these changes remains elusive, but details about the structure of the K+ binding site and how it could affect the protein or active site conformation are now starting to emerge, primarily as a result of the recently determined x-ray crystal structure of AdoMet synthetase.

The crystal structure of E. coli metK-encoded AdoMet synthetase isozyme has been solved at 3-Å resolution by Takusagawa and co-workers. ( 2S. Kamitori, G. D. Markham, and F. Takusagawa, submitted for publication. )The location of the two divalent metal ion binding sites have been identified from differences in electron density maps of enzyme crystals grown in the presence of either Mg2+ or Co2+. A third distinct metal ion binding site, 5 and 7 Å away from the two Mg2+ sites, was noted as a site of other spherical high electron density. This was also the site where UO22+ bound and was postulated to be the K+ binding site. This site contains the side chain of glutamate 42 as a potential ligand to the metal ion. The only other residue close to the K+ (or uranyl) ion was serine 263. These residues are conserved in all 11 reported AdoMet synthetase sequences. Guided by the x-ray data, two sets of experiments were conducted to test the importance of glutamate 42 as a ligand to the activating K+ ion: 1) site-directed mutagenesis of this residue was performed to assess whether there was disruption of K+ activation, and 2) evaluation of whether UO22+ activates like K+ or inhibits competitively with respect to K+. We report here results that confirm an important role of glutamate 42 in monovalent cation activation. These studies, in combination with the crystallographic data, suggest that similar structural modes of potassium activation may exist between AdoMet synthetase and two other K+-activated enzymes for which crystal structures have recently been published, dialkylglycine decarboxylase (7Toney M.D. Hohenester E.

Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uranium oxyacetate (uranyl acetate) dihydrate was purchased from NOAH and was of the highest available purity. L-[methyl-14C]methionine (40-60 mCi/mmol, 16.9 mM) was purchased from DuPont NEN. ACES, Tris, EDTA, ATP, Na5P3O10, 8-hydroxyquinoline, lysozyme, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, β-mercaptoethanol, streptomycin sulfate, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (chloride form), were purchased from Sigma. HEPES and MES were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. All other reagents were the highest purity available. P-81 ion exchange paper used in enzyme assays was obtained from Whatman. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad), employing T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, and polynucleotide kinase from New England Biolabs. Mutagenesis was performed on the plasmid pT7-6(metK), which consists of the metK gene (9Boyle S.M. Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Wright J.M. Tabor H. Tabor C.W.

( 3The preparation of pT7-6(metK) and RSR15(DE3) are described elsewhere (Reczkowski, R. S., and Markham, G. D., J. Biol.

Plasmids were purified by either Rapid Pure Miniprep (RPM-60, Bio101 Inc.) or QIAGEN Plasmid Prep. (QIAGEN, Inc.). Following mutagenesis the plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain DM22 (9Boyle S.M. Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Wright J.M. Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for propagation. The DNA sequence of the mutated gene was verified by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The mutagenized plasmid pT7-6(metKE42Q) was ultimately transformed by electroporation into strain RSR15(DE3), an E. coli B strain for which extracts have no detectable AdoMet synthetase activity due to a chromosomal mutation.3 A mutant with a lysine at position 42 was prepared in an analogous fashion, yielding pT7-6(metKE42K). E. coli strain RSR15(DE3) containing the mutagenized plasmid was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an absorbance at 550 nm of 1.0, at which time 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added. RSR15(DE3)pT7-6(metKE42Q) cells were harvested after 4 h and frozen at −80°C. Cells were suspended in 0.1 M Tris·HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8, and lysed by addition of lysozyme (1.0 mg/g cells) followed by sonication. The protein purification followed previously described methods(2Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell free homogenate was treated with streptomycin sulfate, followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation. E42QMetK-AdoMet synthetase was purified by chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose (Sigma), hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad), and aminohexyl-Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia). Protein purity and native structure were determined by denaturing and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (an A280 of 1.3 represents a 1.0 mg/ml solution of the enzyme). In analogous trials, the E42KMetK mutant did not appreciably accumulate after IPTG induction, apparently as a result of proteolysis. Thus E42KMetK-AdoMet synthetase was not further characterized. The overall AdoMet synthetase activity was determined by methods described previously (2Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mM HEPES·N(CH3)4OH, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ATP, L-[methyl-14C]methionine (30-60 mCi/mmol, 0.1 mM), and where indicated 50 mM KCl. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 150 μl of 25 mM EDTA, and 150 μl of the reaction was spotted on a two-centimeter disk of P-81 filter paper (Whatman). After air drying, a group of disks were placed on a Buchner funnel and washed with 4 liters of distilled water; the retained radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in EcoScint scintillation mixture using a Beckman LS2800 liquid scintillation counter. The effects of uranyl ion on AdoMet formation activity were determined under identical conditions, with the exception that the buffer was changed from HEPES·N(CH3)4OH, pH 8.0, to 100 mM ACES·N(CH3)4OH, pH 6.2, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 150 μl of 25 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Substrate saturation data were computer-fitted using the programs of Cleland(10Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Other data were analyzed by least squares fitting in a variety of computer programs. The tripolyphosphate hydrolysis activity was determined as described previously(2Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (50 μl) consisted of 50 mM HEPES·N(CH3)4OH, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM Na5P3O10, and, where indicated, 0.1 mM AdoMet and 10 mM KCl. Phosphate formed as product was quantified by a molybdate-malachite green assay(11Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaera S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Tripolyphosphatase activity in the uranyl inhibition studies was determined by the same method with the exception that the buffer was changed from HEPES·N(CH3)4OH to 100 mM ACES·N(CH3)4OH, pH 6.2, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 150 μl of 25 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Stability constants for UO22+·ATP, UO22+· PPPi, Mg2+·ATP, and Mg2+·PPPi at pH 6.2 were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques (12O'Sullivan W. Smithers G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 294-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Cohn M. Townsend J. Nature. 1954; 173: 1090Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) using a Varian E-109 spectrometer. The stability constants for Mn2+·ATP and Mn2+·PPPi at pH 6.2 were determined by the addition of ATP or PPPi to a solution of 0.1 mM MnCl2 in 100 mM ACES·N(CH3)4OH, pH 6.2, which resulted in a decrease in the EPR signal of free Mn2+(13Cohn M. Townsend J. Nature. 1954; 173: 1090Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant was determined from the concentration of ATP or PPPi that decreased the signal to half its total intensity, giving KD values of 92 and 57 μM, respectively. The Mn2+·ATP and Mn2+·PPPi complexes (0.1 mM MnCl2, and 0.1 mM PPPi or 0.4 mM ATP) were then titrated with a solution of UO2(Ac)2, which led to the release of Mn2+ and an increase in the EPR signal. Values for Kd,app for uranyl complexes were determined from the concentration of uranyl acetate, which led to recovery of half of the total EPR signal; the actual Kd value was calculated from the relationship, Kd = Kd,app/(1 + A/Ka), where A is the concentration of the competing metal (Mn2+), and Ka is the dissociation constant for the (Mn2+·ATP or Mn2+·PPPi) complex (12O'Sullivan W. Smithers G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 294-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Analogous experiments were performed to obtain the Kd for Mg·ATP (0.30 mM) and Mg2+·PPPi (47 μM) under these conditions. The stability constants of UO22+·ATP and UO22+·PPPi were also determined colorimetrically using 8-hydroxyquinoline as a metallochromic dye source(12O'Sullivan W. Smithers G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 294-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A solution of 0.4 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline in ACES·N(CH3)4OH pH 6.2, was titrated with a solution of UO2(Ac)2 (0-60 μM final concentrations), which resulted in an increase in absorbance at 380 nm. This result was then compared to identical titrations of mixtures of 8-hydroxyquinoline and either 0.1 mM ATP or 0.1 mM PPPi. The Kd values were calculated using: Kd = [UO22+]free[ligand]free/[UO22+·ligand], where ligand is ATP or PPPi(12O'Sullivan W. Smithers G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 294-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Kdvalues of 0.2 mM for UO22+·ATP and 0.07 mM UO22+·PPPi were obtained. Solutions contained 100 mM ACES·N(CH3)4, pH 6.2 and 1 mM UO2(Ac)2. The spectra for UO22+·ATP and UO22+·PPPi were obtained by the addition of either 2 mM ATP or 2 mM PPPi. The solutions were excited by 422 nm light with a 5-nm excitation slit width; the fluorescence emission spectrum was detected with a 5-nm slit width. A Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer was used. The final spectra are the average of three scans. The crystal structure of AdoMet synthetase implicated glutamate 42 as a ligand to the K+ activator. Glutamate 42 is the only charged ligand in the vicinity of the K+ binding pocket. Thus the conservative mutation of glutamate 42 to glutamine (E42QMetK) might disrupt monovalent cation binding and activation by removing the negative charge. The E42QMetK mutant was therefore prepared and characterized. During column chromatography, E42QMetK behaved indistinguishably from wild type AdoMet synthetase. Pure E42QMetK is indistinguishable from wild type AdoMet synthetase by electrophoresis under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions. However, the specific activity of the mutant is only 1% that of the K+-activated wild type enzyme. The mutant with lysine at position 42, E42KMetK, was also constructed in order to determine whether the change in side-chain charge might result in an enzyme that was fully active in the absence of a monovalent cation. However, the E42KMetK mutant protein did not accumulate in vivo, suggesting misfolding and proteolytic degradation. Thus the E42KMetK mutant was not amenable to characterization. Initially K+ activation of E42QMetK was tested. Monovalent cation activation of wild type AdoMet synthetase is most pronounced at low substrate concentrations (~Km values, 0.1 mM for ATP, 0.1 mM for L-methionine). The effect of KCl concentration on the activity of wild type versus E42QMetK is shown in Fig. 1. Unlike wild type AdoMet synthetase, the activity of E42QMetK is not stimulated by KCl. The comparison of steady state kinetic parameters for wild type and E42QMetK is shown in Table 1; the results indicate that E42QMetK behaves nearly identically to K+-free wild type AdoMet synthetase in terms of Km and Vmax values as well as relative activities. Furthermore, the Km for Mg2+ is not detrimentally affected by the mutation, consistent with the crystallographic data, which indicate that glutamate 42 is not part of the Mg2+ binding site. The results suggest that glutamate 42 is essential for monovalent cation activation of AdoMet synthetase, presumably by ligating K+. The E42QMetK mutant was also not activated by 0.1 M LiCl, NH4Cl, NaCl, or CsCl, in contrast to the wild type enzyme. Unfortunately there is no direct method for measuring K+ binding to AdoMet synthetase, so it is not clear whether the mutation affects binding as well as activation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Since UO22+ binds to glutamate 42 in crystals, we investigated the effect of UO22+ on wild type AdoMet synthetase activity. If glutamate 42 is a ligand to K+, then UO22+ would be expected to either activate analogously to K+ or competitively inhibit. No ions had been found to be competitive inhibitors with respect to K+, i.e. all monovalent cations tested either activate or apparently do not bind(2Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with uranyl acetate were carried out at pH 6.2 since at higher pH polynuclear UO22+ species and “uranyl and amorphous hydroxide” precipitates form(14Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Critical Stability Constants: Inorganic Complexes. Vol. 4. Plenum Press, New York1976Google Scholar, 15Greenwood N.N. Earnshaw A. Chemistry of the Elements. Pergamon Press, Oxford1986: 1478Google Scholar). Uranyl acetate was soluble up to ~ pH 6.5 in the normal AdoMet synthetase assay buffer, therefore to diminish problems associated with the chemical instability of UO22+, experiments were performed at pH 6.2. The kinetic constants for AdoMet synthetase at pH 6.2 are comparable to those at pH 8.0 (see below). The uranyl cation was found to be a potent inhibitor of AdoMet synthetase. Uranyl acetate at 25 μM fully inhibits K+-free AdoMet synthetase in the presence of Km concentrations of substrates. The inhibition was eliminated by the addition of 10 mM KCl but was unaffected by the addition of up to 100 mM MgCl2, consistent with uranyl binding at the monovalent cation binding site. The relatively small amount of UO22+ required to inhibit the enzyme suggested tight-binding inhibition, which needed to be further characterized before steady state kinetic methods could be used to determine if UO22+ is a competitive inhibitor with respect to K+(16Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Two conditions must hold true for complete steady state kinetic analysis of tight-binding inhibitors; the inhibition must be reversible, and the onset of inhibition must be fast with respect to the assay used(16Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Preferably, the inhibitor concentration used should be at least 10-fold higher than the enzyme concentration to avoid complications associated with depletion of free inhibitor. We first examined whether the UO22+ inhibition was reversible. Irreversible inhibition was a particular concern since uranyl is photo-reactive (17Buchkolz A. Anal. Chim. Phys. 1805; 56: 142Google Scholar, 36Rabinowitch E. Belford R.L. Spectroscopy and Photochemistry of Uranyl Compounds. Pergamon, Oxford1964Google Scholar, 37Burrows H.D. Formosinha S.J. Pinto C.F.

Gandolfi M. Maestri M. Top. Curr. Chem. 1978; 75: 1Crossref Google Scholar) and could produce radical species in the active site resulting in irreversible modification(18Nielsen P.E. Jeppesen C. Buchardt O. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Nielsen P.E. Hiort C. Snnichsen S.H. Burchardt O. Dahl O. Nordn B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4967-4975Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For AdoMet synthetase the uranyl inhibition was fully reversed by dilution into a solution containing saturating amounts of potassium. This was shown by an experiment in which 10 μM enzyme was incubated for 30 min with 50 μM UO2(Ac)2 and substrates (0.1 mM each) in a potassium-free buffer and then the activity determined; the enzyme had 20% of the activity of an UO22+-free control. Parallel uranyl-containing reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min and then diluted 10-fold into buffer containing 50 mM KCl, and further incubated for 30 min prior to determination of the enzymatic activity. The enzyme from the potassium-containing reaction mixture had 92% of the activity of a uranyl free uninhibited control, thus demonstrating that uranyl inhibition was reversible. Many tight-binding inhibitors are also slow-binding inhibitors (19Schloss V.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 348-353Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and require specialized kinetic analysis. Slow onset of inhibition is only relevant to the kinetic analysis if it is slow enough that the reaction time courses do not reflect the true steady state rates. The possibility of slow binding was evaluated by following the product formation from partially inhibited enzyme for 10 min, followed by addition of an additional 20 μM UO22+ (Fig. 2). There was no observable lag in the onset of additional inhibition (Fig. 2)(19Schloss V.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 348-353Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since the uranyl inhibition was both reversible and had a rapid onset, conventional steady state kinetic methods were used to determine the inhibition patterns with various substrates. Double reciprocal plots were used to reveal the type of inhibition with respect to K+, ATP, and methionine. Initially, kinetic constants for AdoMet synthetase at pH 6.2 (100 mM ACES·N(CH3)4OH, 20 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM KCl) were determined to examine whether the enzyme activity was altered at this lower pH. Compared to the standard assay conditions at pH 8.0, the Km values for ATP (0.11 ± 0.01) and L-methionine (0.10 ± 0.01 mM) are essentially unchanged, and the Vmax is reduced only 2-fold. Plots of 1/V versus 1/KCl at various concentrations of UO22+ intersect on the 1/V axis and thus show that uranyl is a competitive inhibitor with respect to potassium (Fig. 3a). A true inhibition constant could not be extracted from a replot of slope versus inhibitor concentration because the replot is not linear (Fig. 3a, inset), which was expected since the concentration of inhibitory species is comparable to the enzyme concentration (see below). An alternative method presented below was used to determine the inhibition constant. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that UO22+ is a competitive inhibitor with respect to potassium, therefore confirming that both UO22+ and K+ bind at the same site. The double-reciprocal plot of initial velocity versusL-methionine concentration at four different levels of UO22+ showed a noncompetitive pattern with intersection on the abscissa (data not shown). The plot of 1/V versus 1/ATP at various UO22+ concentrations should reveal whether free UO22+ or UO22+·ATP is the predominant inhibitory species. Lanthanide metal ions, which inhibit of some nucleotide-utilizing enzymes (e.g. yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (20Tanswell P. Westhead E.W. Williams R.J.P. FEBS Lett. 1974; 48: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and creatine kinase(16Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar)) are not inhibitory as the free ion but are inhibitory as a Ln3+·nucleotide complex. It is also known that UO22+ binds to ATP(24Feldman I. Jones J. Cross R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). If UO22+·ATP is the inhibitory species one would expect to see a set of downward curved lines intersecting at the 1/V axis, as was observed in studies of Eu3+·ATP inhibition of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (20Tanswell P. Westhead E.W. Williams R.J.P. FEBS Lett. 1974; 48: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and creatine kinase(16Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The downward curvature results from increased concentrations of the inhibitory Eu3+·ATP species as the total concentrations of both ATP and Eu3+ increase. For AdoMet synthetase the plot of 1/V versus 1/ATP at fixed concentrations of UO22+ shows the opposite trend (Fig. 3b), with a set of upward curved lines intersecting at the 1/V axis, demonstrating competitive inhibition. Reasoning analogous to the case of Eu3+·ATP suggests that UO22+·ATP is not the inhibitor, since at higher concentrations of both ATP and UO22+ less inhibition is observed than expected from the low concentration data. Rather, it is likely that ATP competes with the enzyme for UO22+. Inhibition constants for tight-binding inhibitors are typically obtained by methods outlined by Williams and Morrison(16Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The methods involve measuring initial velocity as a function of enzyme active site concentration at fixed concentrations of inhibitor and substrates. If the inhibitor is a tight-binding inhibitor such plots have upward curved lines, whereas for conventional inhibitors the plots are linear. For AdoMet synthetase the initial velocity was measured as a function of uranyl concentration, and a non-linear relationship was found (Fig. 4). When the data are fit to of Williams and Morrison, values for Ki,app and the purity of the enzyme can be obtained(16Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). V=1/2R{[(S+It-αE)2+4SαE]1/2-(S+It-αE)}(Eq. 1) In (and, see below), R represents the recipro"

INTRODUCTIONThe biosynthesis of a potentially lethal antibiotic necessitates the existence of a self-resistance mechanism in the producing organism. One of the most common (for review, see (1Cundliffe E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)) involves modification of the antibiotic target site, for example, inhibitors of ribosomal function(2Yamamoto H. Hotta K.

Biophys. 1979; 197: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Activities capable of inactivating antibiotics in vitro have also been described. However, despite the structural diversity of the different antibiotic families, most of the inactivating activities so far described catalyze the N-acetylation of amino groups or O-phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups using acetyl-coenzyme A and ATP, respectively, as donor cofactors. Most of these activities have been reported in aminoglycoside producers (reviewed in (1Cundliffe E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)). Inactivation of fosfomycin by a glutathione S-transferase in the producer strain has also been reported(14Arca P. Rico M. Braa A.F. Villar C.J. Hardisson C. Surez J.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1552-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A possible role for the inactivating activities in the producer strains is their participation in the antibiotic biosynthetic pathway, being in fact biosynthetic enzymes. In the case of puromycin, biochemical evidence suggests a role for puromycin N-acetyltransferase in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic(15Vara J. Prez-Gonzlez J.A. Jimnez A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).We have previously reported the existence of a dual mechanism for inactivation and reactivation of OM in the oleandomycin (OM) 1The abbreviations used are: OMoleandomycinGS-OMglucosylated oleandomycinDTTdithiothreitolGTFglucosyltransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. producer, Streptomyces antibioticus(16Vilches C. Hernndez C. Mndez C. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 161-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain synthesizes an intracellular glucosyltransferase (GTF) enzyme capable of inactivating OM (and a few other macrolides) by glucosylation of the 2ʹ-hydroxyl group of the desosamine present in the antibiotic (Fig. 1). This glucosylated oleandomycin (GS-OM) is the final intracellular product of the pathway. We have proposed that this inactive GS-OM could be secreted through participation of ABC (“ATP Binding Cassette”) transporters encoded by the oleB and oleC genes(18Rodriguez A.M. Olano C. Vilches C. Mndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 8: 571-582Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that the OleB protein is capable of pumping out GS-OM(17Olano C. Rodriguez A.M. Mndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To complete OM biosynthesis, S. antibioticus synthesizes and secretes a second enzyme that has recently been purified(19Quirs L.M. Hernndez C. Salas J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This reactivates the antibiotic by catalyzing release of glucose.Very little is known at present about the reaction mechanisms of enzymes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance. Here we report the purification and characterization of the OM GTF and kinetic studies to obtain a more detailed knowledge of the enzymatic mechanism of this GTF.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagentsOleandomycin, erythromycin, and UDP-glucuronic acid agarose were purchased from Sigma. Rosaramycin was purchased from Schering Corp. UDP-[6-3H]glucose (specific activity 7.6 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml) from Amersham International (United Kingdom). UDP-glucose, UTP, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were from Sigma. Acrylamide and bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad. Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) and ammonium sulfate from Merck, and Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, and Superdex 75 from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were of analytical grade.Purification ProcedureS. antibioticus ATCC 11891, an OM producer, was grown in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of TSB (tripticasein soy broth, Oxoid) liquid medium. The cultures were inoculated with 50 μl of a dense spore suspension and after 48 h at 30°C on an orbital shaker incubator (200 rpm), the mycelia were collected by filtration through Whatman No. 1 filters. The mycelial paste was washed twice with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT). The mycelia was then disrupted by homogenization with glass beads (0.10 mm in diameter) in a Bead Beater (Bead Beater, Bartlesville, OK) for 10 × 15-s periods with 3-min intervals for cooling. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated with streptomycin sulfate (1% final concentration) and the supernatant fractionated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation. After centrifugation (14,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (200 ml volume) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The column was eluted with a gradient of 0-1 M NaCl. Active fractions were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (95% saturation) and, after centrifugation, the precipitate was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5 M ammonium sulfate) before dialysis against buffer B. The sample was then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.6 × 90 cm) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Active fractions were dialyzed against buffer C (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, and 20% glycerol) and then applied to a UDP-glucuronic acid-agarose column (10 ml) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Elution was with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient in buffer C.Enzyme AssaysOM inactivation was monitored using a reaction mixture containing (for a 50-μl final volume): 1 μl of OM (3 μM final concentration), 1 μl of UDP-[3H]Glc (0.26 μM final concentration), and 1 μl of UDP-Glc (22 μM final concentration), and a variable volume of each fraction or buffer. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 3 min and the pH subsequently raised by addition of 5 μl of 0.2 M NaOH. It was then extracted with 50 μl of chloroform, following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min in an Eppendorf minifuge, 25 μl of the lower organic phase were evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 50 μl of methanol. Any radioactivity measured was indicative of the inactivating activity.Biological Assay of OMThe biological activity of OM was tested by performing a bioassay against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240(20Vilches C. Mndez C. Hardisson C. Salas J.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Purification of GS-OMAfter performing glucosylation reactions as described above, the pH of the reaction mixture was raised by adding 0.2 M NaOH (0.1, v/v). This was extracted with 1 volume of chloroform. After centrifugation, the organic phase was recovered, flash evaporated, and suspended in methanol:water (1:1 by volume), before application to a μBondapak C18 column. GS-OM and OM were separated using an isocratic gradient composed of 30% acetonitrile and 70% 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at a 2 ml/min flow rate. Detection was followed by measuring absorbance at 200 nm. Fractions corresponding to GS-OM were collected, dried, and resuspended in chloroform so as to eliminate residual phosphate. The chlorofom was then removed by evaporation and the residue (containing the GS-OM) dissolved in methanol:water (1:1 by volume) and stored at −20°C prior to use.Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Protein AnalysisAnalysis of the samples during protein purification was performed using SDS-PAGE(21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Protein estimation was carried out by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm and by a protein-dye binding assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar).Steady State KineticsInitial velocity assays were carried out using the radiolabeled assay described above. The concentration of one substrate was varied while the concentration of the second substrate was held at a nonsaturating concentration. After stopping the reaction, the amount of GS-OM produced was estimated. The experimental data reported here were all carried out at least in duplicate. Data were analyzed by linear and nonlinear regression using the program Statistica for Windows (Statsoft, Inc.).Measure of Isotopic Exchange Reactions Catalyzed by the GTFThe exchange reactions between UDP-[3H]Glc and [3H]GS-OM were assayed by measuring the formation of [3H]GS-OM from UDP-[3H]Glc and unlabeled OM. Assays were performed as described under “Steady State Kinetics,” except that the concentrations of unlabeled reactants and products were adjusted to the equilibrium conditions at the beginning of the experiment. The concentrations for the unchanged pair were 0.64 and 5 μM, and the concentrations of the changed pair were varied from 0.5 to 40 times the concentration of the other pair depending on the assay. After addition of enzyme, the reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 15 min. A small concentration (10 nM) of UDP-[3H]Glc was added subsequently, and samples taken at different times and used to calculate the rate of isotopic exchange.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTime Course for the Synthesis of OM and the GTFOM production began 24 h after inoculation of S. antibioticus in TSB medium (Fig. 2) and increased progressively during the following 24 h. In cell-free extracts GTF activity was also detected after 24 h of growth, which coincided with the beginning of OM biosynthesis. The GTF activity increased during the next 24 h following a similar pattern to that of OM biosynthesis, suggesting, therefore, that both events are coordinately regulated.Figure 2:Time course for the biosynthesis of OM (·) and the OM GTF ([circo]) during growth of S. antibioticus. At different times of incubation of S. antibioticus in TSB medium, samples were removed and OM present in the supernatant determined by bioassay against M. luteus. The mycelia was collected and the GTF activity assayed using a cell-free extract (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cellular Location of the GTFTo determine the physical location of the GTF, protoplasts were prepared by lysozyme digestion (23Hopwood D.A.

The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, England1985Google Scholar) and gently lysed by 1:10 dilution into a nonstabilizing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM DTT) containing either 150 mM or 1 M NaCl. The samples were ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g) for 30 min and the GTF activity assayed in fractions along the tube. Activity was distributed uniformly, and was independent of the salt concentration used in protoplast lysis (data not shown), indicating the absence of any association between GTF and particulate fractions (i.e. membranes).Purification and Characterization of the GTFThe GTF enzyme was purified by a four-step purification procedure using three chromatographic columns (Fig. 3). A summary of the purification procedure is shown in Table 1. The enzyme was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column at 0.33 M NaCl (Fig. 3A) and from the UDP-glucuronic acid-agarose column at 0.12 M NaCl (Fig. 3C). The enzyme was purified 1,097-fold with an 18% yield. It showed a molecular mass of approximately 57.1 kDa as deduced from SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 4) and 56 kDa as calculated by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min (data not shown). These experiments suggests that the GTF is a monomer. The enzyme was moderately unstable when kept at low temperature, losing almost all activity after a few days at 4°C, although the addition of 1 M ammonium sulfate or 20% glycerol was found to stabilize the enzyme. Activity was maximal between pH 8 and 8.5. Enzyme activity was shown to be unaffected by the addition of different mono or divalent cations, but was affected by the addition of low concentrations of several organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, and acetone. This contrasts with the purified extracellular glycosidase which is active in the presence of as much as 20% acetone or ethanol(19Quirs L.M. Hernndez C. Salas J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Chromatography of the different steps in the purification of the GTF.

Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by the following equation: v=V·A·BKia·Kb+Ka·B+Kb·A+A·B(Eq. 1) where A and B signify the first and second substrates, respectively, that bind to the enzyme, V is Vmax, Ka and Kb are the Km values for A and B, respectively, and Kia is the dissociation constant for the reaction of A with the free enzyme. A plot of 1/v versus 1/[substrate] showed a set of converging lines, when the substrate was either UDP-Glc (Fig. 5A) or [OM] (Fig. 5B) at fixed concentrations of the other substrate. The following parameters were obtained by performing nonlinear regression analysis of the initial velocity data: V = 363.8 ± 27 nmol·min-1·mg protein-1; Ka = 2.9 ± 0.19 μM, Kb = 21.57 ± 2.3 μM, Kia = 0.44 ± 0.06 μM. A set of intersecting lines in the analysis of the initial velocity steady state kinetic data is indicative of a sequential mechanism in which a ternary complex is formed prior to product release.Figure 5:Double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocities with variable substrate concentrations.

Rosaramycin is a macrolide that is related structurally to OM and has been described as an alternative substrate for the GTF(16Vilches C. Hernndez C. Mndez C. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 161-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When rosaramycin was used instead of OM, convergence between lines became more apparent (data not shown), due to the change in the kinetic parameters. The values of the new parameters obtained by nonlinear regression were: V = 232 ± 31 nmol·min-1·mg protein-1, Ka = 13.22 ± 2.1 μM, Kb = 42.09 ± 3.8 μM, Kia = 11.14 ± 1.6 μM. An increase in the value of Kia close to that of Ka makes the convergence between the lines much more evident and places the intersection point just below the horizontal axis.However, a graphical analysis of the results of both experiments expressed in reciprocal form in terms of Ø's according to the equation of Daziel(25Daziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1712Crossref Google Scholar) : E0v=Ø0+ØAA+ØBB+ØABAB(Eq. 2) showed that all the values of the Ø's changed when rosaramycin was used as alternative substrate. This indicates OM binds the enzyme in the first place (substrate A), based on the fact that the use of an alternative substrate for B would maintain some of the coefficients constant depending on the mechanism of the reaction. It can also be concluded that the reaction occurs by a compulsory-order mechanism, due to the fact that in the random order equilibrium pathway ØAB/ØA might be unaltered when using an alternative substrate for A.Study of Substrate Binding Order Using Dead-end InhibitorsDead-end inhibitors were used to obtain information about the mechanism of the reaction and the substrate binding order. The concentration of one of the substrates was fixed at a subsaturating level, and the concentration of the other substrate varied; experiments were performed at different concentrations of the dead-end inhibitor, including 0.The antibiotic erythromycin is structurally very similar to OM, but it is not a substrate for the GTF(16Vilches C. Hernndez C. Mndez C. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 161-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When erythromycin was added to the reaction using OM as the varied substrate, a set of lines of different slopes was observed, while the intersection point remained constant, thus indicating a competitive inhibition (Fig. 6A). If the substrate varied was UDP-Glc, the lines changed, both in their slope and intersection point (Fig. 6B), implying noncompetitive inhibition.Figure 6:Patterns of dead-end inhibition of the GTF by erythromycin (panels A and B) or by UTP (panels C and D) as a function of the OM (panels A and C) or UDP-Glc (panels B and D) concentrations. The concentrations of UDP-Glc and OM were kept constant at 8 μM (panels A and C) and 2 μM (panels B and D), respectively. The concentrations of erythromycin as inhibitor (panels A and B) were: ●, 0 μM; ○, 2.5 μM; ■, 5 μM; ■, 10 μM. The concentrations of UTP as inhibitor (panels C and D) were: ●, 0 μM; ○, 25 μM; ■, 67 μM; ■, 200 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)UTP was also found to act as a dead-end inhibitor of the reaction. When reactions were carried out in the presence of UTP using UDP-Glc as the varied substrate, the lines changed their slopes but the intersection point remained constant, suggesting competitive inhibition (Fig. 6D). If the varied substrate was OM, the lines were parallel, with unchanged slope but with changed point of intersection, indicating uncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 6C).Data from dead-end inhibitors are summarized in Table 2. The patterns of inhibition observed showed noncompetitive inhibition for erythromycin when UDP-Glc is varied and uncompetitive inhibition for UTP when OM is varied, and this is compatible only with a compulsory-order mechanism. It does not, however, differentiate between formation of a ternary complex or if its concentration is negligible (Theorell-Chance mechanism). On the other hand, these results allow confirmation of the order of substrate addition, OM being first and UDP-Glc second.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Equilibrium ConstantThe equilibrium constant for the GTF reaction might be expected to be independent of pH as no net production or uptake of protons occurs during the course of the transglucosylation reaction. The time taken to reach equilibrium was first established by measurement of the change in the concentration of GS-OM with time after addition of the enzyme to solutions similar to those described below. Reaction was always completed in less than 1 h. When sampled after several hours, the concentration of GS-OM began to decrease, due to its instability at 30°C. Keq was measured by fixing the ratio of [OM]/[GS-OM] at 1 and varying the ratio of [UDP]/[UDP-Glc] from 10 to 80. A plot of the change in GS-OM concentration versus [UDP]/[UDP-Glc] is shown in Fig. 7. The value at which the line intercepts with the ordinate axis for an abscissa value of 0 is equal to the equilibrium constant Keq = 60.81.Figure 7:Plot of δ[GS-OM] versus [UDP]/[UDP-Glc] for determining the equilibrium constant of the GTF reaction. A linear regression of the data gave a [UDP]/[UDP-Glc] value of 60.81 at a [GS-OM] of 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reactions of Isotopic Exchange at EquilibriumTo obtain information about the order of products release and more details about the reaction mechanism, we performed isotopic exchange experiments under equilibrium conditions. The concentration of a substrate-product pair was varied so as not to disturb the equilibrium; its effect on the rate of isotopic exchange between UDP-[3H]Glc and [3H]GS-OM was then determined. The progress curve for the exchange, monitored by sampling the reaction mixture at different time intervals, showed in all the cases a first-order rate law; these curves were used to calculate the rates of exchange. The exchange rate was also directly proportional to enzyme concentration, as would be expected in the absence of subunit dissociation and association effects.When the effect of increased concentrations of the pair OM/GS-OM on the rates of exchange between UDP-[3H]Glc and [3H]GS-OM was measured, a hyperbolic plot was obtained (Fig. 8A). A similar experiment varying the pair OM/UDP produced a plot showing an initial increase followed by a decrease due to inhibition of the isotopic exchange at high concentrations of the pair OM/UDP (Fig. 8A). These results are consistent only if the order of product release is the one shown in Fig. S1, where UDP leaves first followed by GS-OM. Raising the concentration of the pair OM/UDP makes the enzyme-GS-OM and enzyme species scarce, increasing other forms, and the exchange rates are lowered. If the concentration of the OM/GS-OM pair was raised, only the free enzyme becomes scarce and the rates of exchange approach a maximum asymptotically.Figure 8:Influence of increasing concentrations of different substrate/product pairs on the rate of exchange between UDP-Glc and GS-Om. A: ●, varying the pair OM/UDP; ○, varying the pair OM/GS-OM. B: ●, varying the pair UDP-Glc/UDP; ○, varying the pair UDP-Glc/GS-OM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S1:Scheme 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The differentiation between a compulsory-order system with the formation of a ternary complex and a Theorell-Chance mechanism is possible by performing experiments where the influence on the rate of isotopic exchange is measured when the concentration of the pairs composed by the second substrate and one of the different products is increased. Increasing the concentration of the UDP-Glc/GS-OM pair a hyperbolic plot was produced (Fig. 8B), while the increase of the UDP-Glc/UDP pair produced a plot which initially increased but later showed a depression at higher concentrations (Fig. 8B). These results confirm the order of the product release from the enzyme, since raising the concentrations of the UDP-Glc/UDP pair increases the concentrations of the central enzymic forms, and depresses the rate of isotopic exchange. This is compatible only with an ordered mechanism in which a ternary complex is formed. In a Theorell-Chance mechanism, the increase in the UDP-Glc/UDP pair would produce a hyperbolic plot since in this mechanism the process EA + B EQ ⇌ + P is a simple bimolecular process.In summary, the mechanism of the GTF reaction can be represented as in Fig. S1. The substrates bind in a compulsory order to the enzyme, first the OM and then the UDP-Glc to form a ternary complex in which the exchange reaction takes place. Product release also occurs in a compulsory order, UDP first followed subsequently by GS-OM. INTRODUCTIONThe biosynthesis of a potentially lethal antibiotic necessitates the existence of a self-resistance mechanism in the producing organism. One of the most common (for review, see (1Cundliffe E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)) involves modification of the antibiotic target site, for example, inhibitors of ribosomal function(2Yamamoto H. Hotta K.

Biophys. 1979; 197: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Activities capable of inactivating antibiotics in vitro have also been described. However, despite the structural diversity of the different antibiotic families, most of the inactivating activities so far described catalyze the N-acetylation of amino groups or O-phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups using acetyl-coenzyme A and ATP, respectively, as donor cofactors. Most of these activities have been reported in aminoglycoside producers (reviewed in (1Cundliffe E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)). Inactivation of fosfomycin by a glutathione S-transferase in the producer strain has also been reported(14Arca P. Rico M. Braa A.F. Villar C.J. Hardisson C. Surez J.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1552-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A possible role for the inactivating activities in the producer strains is their participation in the antibiotic biosynthetic pathway, being in fact biosynthetic enzymes. In the case of puromycin, biochemical evidence suggests a role for puromycin N-acetyltransferase in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic(15Vara J. Prez-Gonzlez J.A. Jimnez A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).We have previously reported the existence of a dual mechanism for inactivation and reactivation of OM in the oleandomycin (OM) 1The abbreviations used are: OMoleandomycinGS-OMglucosylated oleandomycinDTTdithiothreitolGTFglucosyltransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. producer, Streptomyces antibioticus(16Vilches C. Hernndez C. Mndez C. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 161-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain synthesizes an intracellular glucosyltransferase (GTF) enzyme capable of inactivating OM (and a few other macrolides) by glucosylation of the 2ʹ-hydroxyl group of the desosamine present in the antibiotic (Fig. 1). This glucosylated oleandomycin (GS-OM) is the final intracellular product of the pathway. We have proposed that this inactive GS-OM could be secreted through participation of ABC (“ATP Binding Cassette”) transporters encoded by the oleB and oleC genes(18Rodriguez A.M. Olano C. Vilches C. Mndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 8: 571-582Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that the OleB protein is capable of pumping out GS-OM(17Olano C. Rodriguez A.M. Mndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To complete OM biosynthesis, S. antibioticus synthesizes and secretes a second enzyme that has recently been purified(19Quirs L.M. Hernndez C. Salas J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This reactivates the antibiotic by catalyzing release of glucose.Very little is known at present about the reaction mechanisms of enzymes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance. Here we report the purification and characterization of the OM GTF and kinetic studies to obtain a more detailed knowledge of the enzymatic mechanism of this GTF."

Using an oligonucleotide probe derived from the active site sequence of the mammalian low Mr PTPases, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene that encodes a homolog of this enzyme was cloned by low stringency hybridization. This gene, LTP1, together with a neighboring gene, TKL1, is shown to be located on the right arm of chromosome XVI. The deduced amino acid sequence of its 161-amino acid residue product shows a 39% average identity with that of the mammalian enzymes. The yeast Ltp1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and shown to possess PTPase activity. The recombinant Ltp1 efficiently hydrolyzes phosphotyrosine and a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, Tyr531-fyn, but it shows low activity toward phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. The catalytic activity of Ltp1 toward a number of substrates was approximately 30-fold lower than the corresponding values measured for the bovine low Mr PTPase. However, the yeast enzyme was markedly activated by adenine and some purine nucleosides and nucleotides, including cAMP and cGMP. In the case of adenine, the activity of Ltp1 was increased by approximately 30-fold. The high degree of evolutionary conservation of the low Mr PTPases implies a significant role for this enzyme. However, neither the disruption of the LTP1 gene nor an approximately 10-fold overexpression of its product in S. cerevisiae caused any apparent phenotypic changes under the conditions tested. No proteins related to Ltp1 could be detected in extracts of the ltp1 null mutant, either by immunoblotting or by gel-filtration analysis accompanied by extended kinetic assays, consistent with the conclusion that LTP1 is the only low Mr PTPase-encoding gene in S. cerevisiae.

The regulation of these processes involves cascades of reversible protein phosphorylation events occurring on tyrosyl and/or seryl/threonyl residues that are induced by diverse extra- or intracellular signals. PTPases take part in such signaling cascades either by directly providing a signal via the dephosphorylation of one or more downstream target proteins (3Millar J.B.A. Russell P.

Despite a significant diversity of primary sequences, the vast majority of PTPases contain one or two copies of a conserved catalytic domain of approximately 240 residues(1Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A signature motif, (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G, including catalytically essential cysteine and arginine residues, is located in its C-terminal region. At least two subfamilies, VH1-like and cdc25 dual specificity protein phosphatases, have been characterized whose sequence homology with other PTPases is restricted to approximately 30 residues surrounding the active site motif(1Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, a nuclear protein-tyrosine phosphatase PRL-1 was recently identified that lacks any homology beyond the active site motif to the previously identified PTPases(8Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).

This sequence includes a cysteine residue responsible for the transient formation of a phosphocysteinyl covalent intermediate in the course of enzymatic reaction and an arginine involved in the binding of a phospho group of substrate(16Wo Y.-Y.P.

Recent crystallographic studies have demonstrated the near identity of the three-dimensional structures of the phosphate-binding loops of bovine low Mr PTPase (BPTP)(30Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Su X.-D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P.

Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, the low molecular weight PTPases represent a novel class of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Despite the fact that the structure and catalytic mechanism of the low Mr PTPase has been well studied, little is known about the physiological role of this protein, beyond a report that overexpression of the bovine liver enzyme in murine fibroblasts caused a reduction in the level of autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor, thereby inhibiting a mitogenic response to PDGF(34Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of the low Mr PTPase in the cell, we focused our efforts on the search for a homologous gene in a genetically tractable organism, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When this study was initiated, no low Mr PTPase gene or corresponding enzyme activity from the organisms other than vertebrates had been described. Using low stringency hybridization we have isolated a S. cerevisiae gene, designated LTP1, whose product shows 39% average sequence identity to the mammalian enzymes. After the present sequence had been deposited in GenBank™ (accession number U11057), a report appeared which described a homologous gene (stp1+) from the evolutionarily divergent fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe(35Mondesert O. Moreno S. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27996-27999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the stp1+-encoded protein was not directly demonstrated to be an active phosphatase, it was cloned as a multicopy suppressor of a mutation in the cdc25+ gene that encodes a dual specificity phosphatase involved in mitotic control(35Mondesert O. Moreno S. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27996-27999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the cloning and chromosomal assignment of the LTP1 gene, we report here the heterologous expression and purification of the Ltp1 protein, characterize its phosphatase activity toward a number of substrates, including a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, and describe the marked activation of the enzyme by purines. Finally, an ltp1 null mutation is constructed and tested for phenotypic consequences. The S. cerevisiae strains used in the present study are listed in Table 1. Yeast culture growth, sporulation, and tetrad analysis were carried out using standard protocols(36Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method(37Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae cDNA library in the vector λACT was kindly provided by Dr. S. Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic library in the plasmid YCp50 was a gift of Dr. S. Liebman (University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL), whereas the plasmid pBTM116 was obtained from Dr. S. Fields (State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY). The λ- and cosmid-clone grid filters representing the S. cerevisiae genome were kindly provided by Dr. M. Goebl (Indiana University Medical School, Indianapolis, IN).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A degenerate 44-mer oligonucleotide, 5’-TT(A/G)TT(T/C)GT(T/C)TG(T/C)TT(A/G)GG(T/C)AA(T/C)AT(T/C)TG(T/C)AG(A/G)TC(T/C/A)CC(A/T)AT(C/T)GC(C/T)GA-3’, was used as a probe to isolate the yeast low Mr PTPase cDNA. This oligonucleotide was derived from the sequence of residues 9-23, i.e. LFVCLGNICRSPIAE, which are identical in all known mammalian low Mr PTPases. Escherichia coli strain LE392 was transfected with a S. cerevisiae cDNA library generated in the λACT vector, followed by plaque screening with 5’-end 32P-labeled probe according to standard protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Duplicate nitrocellulose membrane plaque lifts were washed with 2 × SSPE (0.2 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 3 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA), 0.5% SDS during 1 h at 55°C and subjected to prehybridization and hybridization for 4 and 12 h, respectively, at 50°C in 5 × SSPE, containing 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Following hybridization, the membranes were subsequently washed twice for 30 min with 2 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature, the same solution at 50°C for 3 min, and finally with 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 2 h. The dried membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 48 h with an intensifying screen. The positive phage clones were converted to the plasmid form (39Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) and subjected to sequence analysis. DNA sequencing was performed by the chain termination method of Sanger using Sequenase, Version 2 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Isolated LTP1 cDNA was labeled by a random priming method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and used as a probe to screen a S. cerevisiae genomic library in the plasmid YCp50. The library was amplified in E. coli strain HB101. The hybridization of colony lifts onto nitrocellulose was performed in 5 × SSPE, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 60°C for 16 h. The filters were washed with 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at the same temperature for 30 min prior to autoradiography. An E. coli expression vector providing for the synthesis of Ltp1 under control of the T7 polymerase promoter was constructed based on the plasmid pT7-7(40Tabor S. Ausubel S.L. Brent R. Kingston R.F. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.12Google Scholar). The coding sequence of the LTP1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction using the plasmid YCp50(LTP1)-5 and two 26-mer primers, 5’-AACACGCATATGACAATTGAAAAACC-3’ and 5’-TTTTACTCGATGTAGACCGCACCATC-3’. As a result, an NdeI restriction site including the initiation codon of LTP1 was generated. Following treatment with NdeI and NheI, the resulting 487-bp fragment was subcloned into the NdeI, XbaI-digested plasmid pUC18. The resulting plasmid was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and a fragment carrying the coding sequence of LTP1 was isolated and subsequently ligated with the plasmid pT7-7 that had been treated with the same restriction enzymes. This procedure gave rise to the expression vector pT7-7(LTP1). To construct an E. coli expression vector providing for the synthesis of the Ltp1 fused to the glutathione S-transferase (GST), a 0.7-kb HpaI-XhoI fragment from pL10 was subcloned into pGEX-KG (41Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) that has been treated with EcoRI, Klenow fragment, and XhoI. The resulting plasmid pGST-LTP1 contained the coding regions of glutathione S-transferase and the LTP1 genes separated by a sequence encoding a thrombin cleavage site, a glycine kinker, and including 9 bp of the 5’-noncoding region of LTP1. A plasmid for the disruption of the LTP1 gene was constructed as follows. A 3.5-kb BglII-EcoRI fragment from the plasmid YCp50(LTP1) was subcloned into BamHI-EcoRI-digested pBR327 to generate pBR327(LTP1). A 1.7-kb BamHI fragment containing the S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene was subcloned into the same site of pUC18. The fragment of the same size was released by treatment of the resulting plasmid with SmaI and XbaI and ligated with HpaI, NheI-digested pBR327(LTP1). As a result, a fragment of the LTP1 gene, including 9 bp of the 5’-noncoding region, the entire coding sequence, and 1 bp of 3’-noncoding sequence, was replaced by the HIS3 gene. The 3.8-kb PvuII-EcoRI fragment carrying the disrupted ltp1::HIS3 gene was purified and used for yeast transformation. A vector for the overexpression of the LTP1 gene in S. cerevisiae was constructed based on the plasmid pBTM116 which carried the lexA gene inserted between the promoter and transcriptional terminator of the ADH1 gene. To replace lexA by LTP1, this plasmid was subjected to partial digestion with HindIII followed by blunt-ending with Klenow fragment, digestion with BamHI, and ligation with a HpaI-BglII fragment of the LTP1 cDNA. As a result, a plasmid pALA1 was generated. The GST-Ltp1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli strain HB101 transformed with the plasmid pGST-LTP1 and purified using affinity chromatography on a glutathione-agarose column (41Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The Ltp1 protein was released by on-column thrombin cleavage. The nonfusion Ltp1 was expressed as follows. An overnight culture of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) bearing the plasmid pT7-7(LTP1) was diluted 100-fold with 2 liters of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 mg/liter) and grown at 37°C. When the culture reached the optical density of 2.0 at 600 nm, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added up to a final concentration of 0.2 mM, and the culture was grown for an additional 4 h. The recombinant protein was purified by chromatography on SP-Sephadex C-50 column followed by gel-filtration on Sephadex G-50 using a procedure developed for the recombinant bovine low Mr PTPase(16Wo Y.-Y.P. Zhou M.-M. Stevis P. Davis J.P. Zhang Z.-Y. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of Ltp1 in the yeast cell extracts was performed as follows. The cells (total optical density at 600 nm of 5.0) were boiled in 200 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer for 10 min and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The samples (25-50 μl) were electrophoresized in SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 50 V for 6 h. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mM sodium chloride), containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with 5000-fold diluted Ltp1 rabbit antiserum and then with 20,000-fold diluted goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) in the blocking solution. Each incubation was performed at room temperature for 1 h, followed by washing with the same solution without bovine serum albumin. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Corp.). The enzymatic assays were performed in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mM EDTA at the ionic strength of 0.15 M which was adjusted using sodium chloride. The rate of substrate dephosphorylation was established by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate using a Malachite Green assay procedure (42Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) or the liberation of p-nitrophenol that was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm. A phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, Tyr531-fyn (Ac-FTATEPQY(P)QPGENL-COOH), derived from the autophosphorylation site of the protein-tyrosine kinase fyn was a gift from Dr. Terry Higgins (Sterling Drug Co., Inc.). The effect of adenine on the tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the Ltp1 protein was studied at room temperature using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The protein was present at a final concentration of 0.12 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mM EDTA, and adenine concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 mM. The ionic strength of the solution was maintained at 0.15 M using sodium chloride. The sample, contained in a NSGT-52 dual path length cell (1 cm × 4 mm), was excited at a wavelength of 300 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm. Emission was observed at a wavelength range from 310 to 400 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm. Kd values were determined using the tryptophan fluorescence intensity changes observed at 345 nm(43Pokalsky C. Wick P. Harms E. Lytle F.E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3809-3815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Emission spectra were corrected using NIST SRM 1931 standards. Low stringency hybridization was employed to search for a S. cerevisiae gene encoding a homolog of the mammalian low Mr PTPases.

This oligonucleotide hybridized with a single fragment of XbaI-digested yeast total chromosome DNA under optimized conditions (Fig. 1). Screening of the S. cerevisiae cDNA library performed under the same conditions allowed us to isolate twelve putative positive clones among approximately 100,000 plaques tested. However, Southern hybridization of purified plasmid DNA indicated that only one of them, designated pL10, produced a signal comparable with that of the cDNA encoding the low Mr PTPase from bovine heart. A 719-bp cDNA fragment purified from clone pL10 was found to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein sequence that was 39% identical to the mammalian low Mr PTPases. Two other isolated clones exhibited approximately 5-10 times weaker signals on Southern blots, but their nucleotide sequences showed no relation to the low Mr PTPase. The remainder of the clones gave hybridization signals that were hardly distinguishable from the background. Screening of a S. cerevisiae genomic library using the isolated cDNA from clone pL10 as a probe made possible the isolation of 19 positive clones. All of them contained a 120-bp HpaI-XbaI fragment that was also present in pL10 cDNA, and they were all related to each other as indicated by the presence of other common restriction sites. One of the identified clones, YCp50(LTP1)-5, carrying a 5.4-kb insert of yeast genomic DNA, was further characterized by partial sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of a 1329-bp fragment was shown to comprise an open reading frame which was identical to that found in the previously isolated cDNA (Fig. 2). Based on the high homology of the deduced protein sequence to that of mammalian low Mr PTPases, the isolated gene was designated LTP1 (low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase). In addition, we found that the sequence overlapped at the 5’ terminus with a previously published sequence of the gene TKL1 encoding transketolase(44Sundstrom M. Lindquist Y. Schneider G. Hellman U. Ronne H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24346-24352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A common fragment that encompassed 261 bp of the TKL1 coding sequence and 120 bp of its 3’-noncoding region was found, with no differences between the present results and the previously published sequence data. Thus, the coding sequence of LTP1 is located downstream from the TKL1 gene and is separated from the stop codon of the latter by a 377-bp fragment (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, the chromosome localization of the TKL1 gene has not been described previously. To map the LTP1 gene, a set of λ"

Eukaryotic tRNASec exhibits an aminoacyl acceptor stem with a unique length of 9 base pairs. Within this stem, two base pairs, G5a.U67b and U6.U67, drew our attention, whose non-Watson-Crick status is maintained in the course of evolution either through U6.U67 base conservation or base covariation at G5a.U67b. Single or double point mutations were performed, which modified the identity of either or both of the base pairs. Serylation by seryl-tRNA synthetase was unaffected by substitutions at either G5a.U67b or U6.U67. Instead, and quite surprisingly, changing G5a.U67b and U6.U67 to G5a-C67b/U6.G67 or G5a-C67b/C6-G67 gave rise to a tRNASec mutant exhibiting a gain of function in serylation. This finding sheds light on the negative influence born by a few base pairs in the acceptor stem of tRNASec on its serylation abilities. The tRNASec capacities to support selenocysteylation were next examined with regard to a possible role played by the two non-Watson-Crick base pairs and the unique length of the acceptor stem. It first emerges from our study that tRNASec transcribed in vitro is able to support selenocysteylation. Second, none of the point mutations engineered at G5a.U67b and/or U6.U67 significantly modified the selenocysteylation level. In contrast, reduction of the acceptor stem length to 8 base pairs led tRNASec to lose its ability to efficiently support selenocysteylation.

Selenocysteine is a cysteine residue in which the thiol group is replaced by the selenol group, SeH. This amino acid has been found in prokaryotic and animal proteins that are generally involved in oxidation-reduction reactions. Selenocysteine is not present in the pool of natural amino acids. Rather, its cotranslational insertion into polypeptide chains responds to a complex biochemical machinery, the mechanism of which has been entirely unraveled in bacteria (see (1Baron C. Bck A. Sll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 524-544Google Scholar) and references therein for review). A specialized selenocysteine, tRNAUCASec 1The abbreviations used are: tRNASecselenocysteine tRNAbpbase pair. , is first charged with serine by the conventional seryl-tRNA synthetase. The product seryl-tRNASec is subsequently bound by selenocysteine synthase, an enzyme which converts the seryl residue to selenocysteine, using an activated phosphoselenoate compound as the selenium donor. This activated compound is itself the product of the SELD enzyme. Selenocysteine tRNASec is then brought to an in frame selenocysteine-specifying UGA codon by SELB, a specific elongation factor different from EF-Tu. Much less is known as to how the eukaryotic machinery fulfills its role. The only identified protein component consists in a fraction containing SELD and selenocysteine synthase-like activities isolated from mouse liver(2Mizutani T. Kurata H. Yamada K. Totsuka T. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic selenocysteine tRNAs have been shown for quite some time to recognize the UGA codon and to support serine to selenocysteine conversion(3Lee B.J. Worland P.J. Davis J.N. Stadtman T.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9724-9727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mizutani T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In a previous work(5Sturchler C. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we proposed a secondary and tertiary structure model for vertebrate tRNASec. Its secondary structure deviates from that of a classical elongator tRNA by the occurrence, among other structural features, of exceptionally long aminoacyl acceptor and dihydrouracil stems comprising 9 and 6 bp, respectively. On the basis of these unusual characteristics, we asked whether base pairs in, or the unique length of, the acceptor stem, with regard to 7 bp found in the majority of elongator tRNAs, could reflect a function in selenocysteylation. In this work, we first establish that tRNASec molecules transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase can support selenocysteylation in an in vitro assay. Second, we conclude that the length of the acceptor stem constitutes one structural element of tRNASec required for the serine to selenocysteine conversion step. selenocysteine tRNA base pair. Synthetic bovine wild-type and mutant selenocysteine tRNAs (6Amberg R. Urban C. Reuner B. Scharff P. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Gross H.J.

The sequences of the oligo couples, which were used to synthesize the wild-type tRNASec, are given in Table 1. Mutants were constructed by swapping appropriately one or several couples with oligos containing the substituted sequences. Also included were the promoter of the T7 RNA polymerase immediately 5’ to the coding sequence and a BstNI site CCAGG 3’ to the coding region to generate the tRNA with a CCA 3’-end after linearization and transcription of the DNA templates. BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites located 5’ and 3’ to the coding region, respectively, were also incorporated in the oligos. After phosphorylation, the 12 oligos were combined, and the mixture incubated at 90°C for 10 min and then slowly cooled down to 25°C. Intermolecular ligation of the oligos and to BamHI/EcoRI-cut pUC119 vector was performed overnight at 16°C.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab T7 RNA polymerase was prepared from the overexpressing strain Escherichia coli BL21pAR1219 kindly provided by F. William Studier. The purification protocol employed was described in (7Zadowski V. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Conditions for transcription in vitro were as in (5Sturchler C. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The RNA products were purified by gel electrophoresis and electroeluted. When necessary, 10% analytical gels were run and stained with Stains-all for estimation of the ratio of tRNASec transcripts carrying an intact CCA end. Prior to use, tRNA transcripts were renatured by heating to 65°C for 3 min and then at 25°C for 5 min. Aminoacylation occurred in 100 μl of buffer containing 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM ATP, 40 μM [3H]serine (29 Ci/mmol). For plateau value determinations, tRNAs were added at a concentration of 3 μM, and the aminoacylation medium was incubated for 5-90 min at 37°C. Kinetic parameters were determined from three to six independent experiments with tRNA concentrations ranging from 3 to 12 μM. Reactions were started by adding 4 μg of a protein fraction containing partially purified bovine seryl-tRNA synthetase prepared as described in (8Mizutani T. Narihara T. Hashimoto A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 143: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 20-μl aliquots were transferred onto pieces of Whatman 3 MM paper and submitted to 5% trichloroacetic acid washes. Radioactivity remaining on the filters was measured by scintillation counting. H75Se- was prepared enzymatically from radioactive sodium selenite (DuPont NEN) and chromatographically purified according to (2Mizutani T. Kurata H. Yamada K. Totsuka T. Biochem.

Briefly, tRNASec (25-100 ng) was incubated for 2 h at 30°C in a 50-μl reaction mixture comprising 200 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM ATP, 0.4 mM serine, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.7 μM H75Se- (1-2 μCi), 3 μg of a fraction containing partially purified seryl-tRNA synthetase, and 10 μl of a fraction containing the selenide-activating and selenocysteine synthase activities. After ethanol precipitation, alkaline hydrolysis of the [75Se]selenocysteyl-tRNASec released [75Se]selenocysteine, which was separated by TLC on silicagel G plates in n-butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:1). 75Se radioactivity was measured with a Fuji BioImage BAS 2000 analyzer. Cold selenocysteine (a generous gift of Prof. K. Soda, Kyoto University) was cochromatographed as a control and revealed by ninhydrin reaction. Fig. 1A shows the 9-bp aminoacyl acceptor stem of tRNASec and the sequence covariations, which allow its maintenance in the course of evolution(5Sturchler C. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A.

When comparison is restricted to the non-canonical (non-Watson-Crick) base pairs G5a.U67b and U6.U67, one can observe that the latter is strictly conserved in identity. The non-canonical status at position 5a.67b is maintained with, however, a G5a.U67b to A5a.G67b covariation, which was allowed in Drosophila. Conservation of or covariations at non-Watson-Crick base pairs aiming at maintaining a non-canonical status in RNA helices are often indicative of an important structural or functional role played by these particular base pairs(10Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 11Moras D. Commarmond M.B. Fischer J. Weiss R. Thierry J.C. Ebel J.P. Gieg R.

Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In connection with this and the occurrence of an unusually long acceptor stem, we asked two questions: 1) is there a function devoted to these non-Watson-Crick base pairs and 2) what role can be attributed to the long acceptor stem? The first step in the selenocysteine insertion machinery consists in the charging of tRNASec with serine. Thus, to determine if the aforementioned non-Watson-Crick base pairs could exert a function, we first wished to know whether altering this base pairing scheme would affect serylation of tRNASec. To this end, a series of single or double point mutations was performed, which substituted G5a.U67b and U6.U67 (Fig. 1B). All four possible Watson-Crick pairs and G.U or U.G pairs were engineered by introducing four single and two double point mutations at the U6.U67 base pair. Separately, G5a.U67b was substituted to a Watson-Crick G-C pair and to the non-canonical A.G pair found in Drosophila (Fig. 1B). The tRNASec variants carrying these mutations were produced by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. The calculated relative Vmax/Km values (Table 2) for the mutants compared to wild-type tRNASec are in the range of 0.5-3, reflecting an almost negligible effect of the substitutions. We therefore concluded that the replacements made separately at G5a.U67b or U6.U67 did not influence significantly serylation of tRNASec. We next produced substitution mutants of both the G5a.U67b and U6.U67 base pairs, giving rise to two different tRNASec variants carrying the combined substitutions G5a-C67b/U6.G67 or G5a-C67b/C6-G67 (Fig. 1C). The Vmax/Kmratio of G5a-C67b/U6.G67 increased by a factor 6 compared to wild-type tRNASec (Table 2). This value results from a decrease in the apparent Km (8.5 μM) and an increase in Vmax (475 units). The surprise, however, arose from mutant G5a-C67b/C6-G67, which exhibited a dramatic increase in the Vmax/Kmratio, becoming 17.5 times as high as that of wild-type tRNASec (Table 2). Both a significant drop in the apparent Km value (5 μM) and an increase in the Vmax (875 arbitrary units) contribute to the obtention of this unexpected finding. Thus, point mutations changing G5a.U67b to G5a-C67b or U6.U67 to either U6.G67 or C6-G67 did not provoke significant effects. In marked contrast, the combined substitutions G5a-C67b/U6.G67 and G5a-C67b/C6-G67, and more prominently the latter one generating an almost all G-C pair acceptor stem, endows serylation of these tRNASec variants with a higher Vmax/Km ratio than the wild type.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Utilization of an in vitro assay for serine to selenocysteine conversion was primarily reported in (2Mizutani T. Kurata H. Yamada K. Totsuka T. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is described under “Experimental Procedures.” As the assay was originally established for native tRNASec purified from bovine liver, a prerequisite was to verify that an in vitro transcribed tRNASec (T7tRNASec) was also able to support selenocysteylation. Fig. 2A shows this is indeed the case since 25 ng of native tRNASec or T7tRNASec (lanes 1 and 2, respectively) gave rise to [75Se]selenocysteine spots of similar intensity. When the number of femtomoles of [75Se]selenocysteine produced in the assay by T7tRNASec was plotted versus the T7tRNASec concentration, the dose-product relationship reached a plateau at 10 nM of tRNASec (Fig. 2B). Thus, in further experiments, 25 or 100 ng of T7tRNASec, corresponding to approximately 15 and 55 nM in the assay, will be used. All the substitution mutants that changed singly G5a.U67b or U6.U67, or those that substituted both base pairs together (see Fig. 1, B and C), were assayed for their capacities to be selenocysteylated. Table 2 reports the percentage of selenocysteylation of the tRNASec variants with respect to the in vitro transcribed wild-type tRNASec. It ranges from 75% for the U6.U67 to U6.G67 and C6-G67 covariations to 98% for the G5a.U67b to G5a-C67b base replacement. This indicates that values fluctuate moderately and do not deviate significantly from that provided by wild-type tRNASec. From these results, we conclude that base replacements or covariations engineered at some targeted base pairs in the amino acceptor arm do not affect selenocysteylation under our conditions. To answer the second question aiming at assigning a specific role to the particularly long acceptor stem, base pair G5a.U67b or U6.U67 was deleted, giving rise to mutant Δ(G5a.U67b) or Δ(U6.U67), represented in Fig. 1D. Aminoacylation kinetics were performed, which indicated that the tRNASec deletion mutants possess a slightly better capacity of charging serine than the wild type (Fig. 3). The variability observed in the plateau values is not caused by differences in the tRNA quantities but is rather due to the well known plateau effects, which take into account the spontaneous and enzymatic deacylation of tRNAs(15Dietrich A. Kern D. Bonnet J. Gieg R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, 100% of charging cannot be attained, and what was observed very likely reflects the effects of the mutations. These deletion mutants were next assayed for their abilities to support serine to selenocysteine conversion. Surprisingly, Table 2 shows that both deletions induced a marked down effect on selenocysteine synthesis. However, the intensity of inhibition is not identical in both cases. Δ(U6.U67) still enables the tRNASec carrying this deletion to support selenocysteylation to 24% of the wild-type level, while Δ(G5a.U67b) gives rise to only 12% of selenocysteylation, a value that we considered as strongly deleterious. To determine whether this was due to deletion of these particular base pairs or to a more general effect caused by reduction of the stem length to 8 bp, two other deletions, Δ(C3-G70) and Δ(A5b.U67a), were generated, which removed C3-G70 and A5b.U67a, respectively (Fig. 1D). These base pairs are situated at two different locations in the stem. Both deletions conferred mitigating up effects on the serylation capacities of the tRNASec variants (Fig. 3). Evaluation of the selenocysteylation abilities of these mutants revealed that both Δ(C3-G70) and Δ(A5b.U67a) achieved a strong repression, leaving 10 and 14% of residual selenocysteylation, respectively (Table 2). Thus, similarly to Δ(G5a.U67b), these deletions led to tRNASec variants unable to convert serine to selenocysteine. Incubation of 100 ng, instead of 25 ng, of the four tRNASec deletion mutants in the assay did not lead to a proportional increase in selenocysteine synthesis. Indeed, it emerges from Table 2 that Δ(C3-G70),Δ(G5a.U67b) and Δ(A5b.U67a), which disabled tRNASec when 25 ng were used, marginally improved the selenocysteylation abilities since the deletion mutants allow about 25% of selenocysteine to be made. Likewise, 37% of selenocysteine was obtained with the Δ(U6.U67) mutant under the same conditions. This indicates that the wild-type selenocysteylation abilities abrogated by the base pair deletions could not be significantly restored by augmenting the tRNASec amount in the assay, thus corroborating the observations made with 25 ng of tRNASec. Collectively, our data establish that shortening the tRNASec amino acceptor stem to 8 bp is severely detrimental to selenocysteylation in vitro. It appears, however, that removal of U6.U67 leads to a less penalizing effect than deletion of the C3-G70, G5a.U67b, or A5b.U67a base pair. The issues underlying the work presented here originate from inspection of the tRNASec secondary structure and sequence comparisons(5Sturchler C. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.H. Jacobson K.B. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the first place, the occurrence of a 9-bp amino acceptor stem, instead of 7 bp in the vast majority of the eukaryotic elongator tRNAs, constituted the central question that guided our investigations. Within this long stem, two non-Watson-Crick base oppositions, G5a.U67b and U6.U67, were shown in our previous work to actually pair in solution(5Sturchler C. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that the non-Watson-Crick (non-canonical) status of base pair U6.U67 is evolutionarily maintained by a strict conservation of both U6 and U67, while the non-canonical status at position 5a.67b subsists during evolution as a result of either sequence conservation or G5a.U67b to A5a.G67b covariation (Fig. 1A). Occurrence of non-Watson-Crick base pairs, their conservation or maintenance by compensatory changes, has been listed in a variety of RNAs such as tRNAs(10Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 11Moras D. Commarmond M.B. Fischer J. Weiss R. Thierry J.C. Ebel J.P. Gieg R. Nature. 1980; 288: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), 5 S RNAs(12Westhof E. Romby P. Romaniuk P.J. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), ribosomal RNAs(13Gautheret D. Konings D. Gutell R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the hammerhead ribozyme(14Pley H.W. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), reflecting important structural and/or functional roles. We elected to disclose the function that could be born by the G5a.U67b and/or U6.U67 base pairs by introducing a series of single or double point mutations at these positions. The first step in selenocysteine synthesis is represented by the charging of tRNASec with serine. It was therefore logical to assess beforehand the possible repercussions of the mutations on the serylation of tRNASec. None of the single base or base pair replacements carried out separately at G5a.U67b or U6.U67 affected in a significant manner serylation of the tRNASec mutants. Much to our surprise, however, the double base pair substitutions G5a-C67b/U6.G67 or G5a-C67b/C6-G67 promoted a strong augmentation of the Vmax/Km ratio. This constituted an unpredictable finding from inspection of the tRNASec structure. These results underline the notion that tRNASec is not optimized for the serylation step. Likewise, it was reported that prokaryotic tRNASec is not an excellent substrate for prokaryotic seryl-tRNA synthetase since the Kcat/Km value is only 1% that of tRNASer(16Baron C. Bck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two groups of investigators established that the long extra arm and the discriminator base G73 of tRNASec function as major identity elements for seryl-tRNA synthetase(17Wu X.Q. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5589-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Ohama T. Yang D.C.H. Hatfield D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our finding proposes that some base pairs in the acceptor stem can negatively influence serylation of tRNASec. In the absence of a structural model describing in detail the interaction between tRNASec and seryl-tRNA synthetase, it is perilous to interpret our data. However, it may well be that the seryl-tRNA synthetase establishes base-specific and/or backbone contacts at the acceptor stem of tRNASer (serine). These would be disadvantaged by the sequence of some bases in the wild-type tRNASec, explaining the revival of activity observed with the two tRNASec mutants. This type of contact was reported to contribute, among others, to the interaction between prokaryotic tRNASer and seryl-tRNA synthetase(19Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusak S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). When it comes to selenocysteylation, the first prominent conclusion of our study resides in the fact that tRNASec transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase can efficiently support selenocysteylation in a similar fashion to native tRNASec. This suggests that the structure of the tRNASecper se is sufficient to govern recognition by selenocysteine synthase, the lack of modified bases in the tRNASec transcript being apparently not redhibitory to selenocysteylation. Selenocysteylation of the tRNASec variants harboring base changes at G5a.U67b and/or U6.U67 revealed that none of the mutants affected the level obtained with the wild-type tRNASec transcript. In marked contrast, exploitable information was furnished by reduction to 8 bp of the length of the acceptor stem. All four deletions, Δ(C3-G70), Δ(G5a.U67b), Δ(A5b-U67a), and Δ(U6.U67), impede the selenocysteylation function of the tRNASec mutants carrying these deletions. A certain disparity was nevertheless observed in the impediment level since the first three mutants obliterate the activity while Δ(U6.U67) reduces dramatically selenocysteylation but does not abolish it. This was interpreted to mean that the length of the acceptor stem of tRNASec plays an important role in the serine to selenocysteine conversion step. Conceivably, the residual level obtained with Δ(U6.U67) could reflect a position-dependent effect of the deletions. One hypothesis would be that selenocysteine synthase not only recognizes the 9-bp acceptor stem but also establishes essential base or backbone-specific contacts with part only of this stem. The U6.U67 deletion would then be less detrimental than others since it is located at the bottom of the stem (Fig. 1A). Alternative possibilities certainly exist, but, as for the serylation mutants, the lack of a model displaying the tRNASec-selenocysteine synthase interactions renders highly speculative any structural interpretation. Despite this, it must be stressed that our phenomenological description remains valid and does highlight the prevalent requirement for a 9-bp acceptor stem. In prokaryotes, the tRNASec acceptor stem is 8 bp long(20Leinfelder W. Zehelein E. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Bck A. Nature. 1988; 331: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 21Baron C. Westhof E. Bck A. Gieg R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 274-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), namely 1 base pair longer than canonical tRNAs but 1 base pair shorter than its eukaryotic counterpart. Shortening to 7 bp reduces selenocysteine-synthase activity but does not compromise it, while this shortened stem prevents recognition by SELB, thus enabling EF-Tu to bind tRNASec(16Baron C. Bck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding underscores a notable difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes for the selenocysteine-synthase recognition elements on tRNASec. The work presented here provides a step toward understanding the mechanisms of eukaryotic serine to selenocysteine conversion. Other issues await answers, for example the purification and cDNA cloning of the eukaryotic SELB counterpart, whose existence was evoked(22Gelpi C. Sontheimer E.J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Proc. Natl.

In particular, it might well be that the non-canonical status of base pairs G5a.U67b and U6.U67 is important for recognition of tRNASec by the eukaryotic SELB factor.

Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase is a membranous enzyme that pumps Ca2+ from the cytoplasm of muscle cells into the reticulum lumen, requiring ATP hydrolysis. The ATPase cycle transports 2Ca2+ per molecule of ATP and per monomer of ATPase, as described in Fig. S1. During the cycle, the transport sites change their orientation and affinity, depending on whether the ATPase is phosphorylated. The high-affinity transport sites of the nonphosphorylated ATPase are accessible from the cytoplasm, whereas once the ATPase has been phosphorylated the transport sites have lower affinity and are accessible from the lumen. This allows Ca2+ release into the SR 1The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumTesN-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidA23187calcimycin. lumen and is followed by dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme. sarcoplasmic reticulum N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid calcimycin. Ca2+ binding to E, the Ca2+-deprived nonphosphorylated ATPase, has been well characterized. Two ions bind sequentially with a high affinity and a positive cooperativity which both depend on the experimental conditions, Ca = 0.1-10 μM and nH = 1.3-2, for pH 8-6, and 0-3 mM Mg2+ at 20°C (1Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two Ca2+ ions are known to be kinetically distinguishable, since Dupont (2Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that the dissociation of half the 45Ca2+ bound to E was impaired by the presence of excess 45Ca2+ in the medium. This has been confirmed by several authors under various experimental conditions, different temperatures, pH, Mg2+ concentrations …(3Dupont Y. Anal.

A simple example of two sites being sequentially accessible from the cytoplasm by the two Ca2+ ions is a channel with a deep site and a superficial site (see the sketch in Fig. 2). The first ion must reach the deep site to leave the superficial site vacant for the second ion. The Ca2+ bound to the superficial site is freely exchangeable with the outer medium, whereas the Ca2+ bound to the deep site is not. Such a description of a channel-like structure for the transport sites was first proposed by Inesi(5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inesi (5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) took advantage of the possibility to selectively place one 45Ca2+ on top of one 45Ca2+, to determine whether their dissociation toward the lumen is sequential. By monitoring the internalization of the Ca2+ ions after phosphorylation, Inesi (5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that their dissociation toward the lumen is sequential and that the first Ca2+ bound to E is the first to be internalized. The question whether the dissociation of the Ca2+ ions toward the lumen is sequential or not has been reinvestigated more recently by Hanel and Jencks (9Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Orlowski and Champeil(10Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In observing the dissociation of Ca2+ from the phosphorylated ATPase, Orlowski and Champeil (10Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found no difference between the dissociation kinetics induced by EGTA or cold Ca2+ and no difference in the dissociation rates of each individual ion. Hanel and Jencks (9Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found no difference between the Ca2+ internalization rates observed using empty vesicles, or vesicles loaded with 20 mM Ca2+, and also no difference between the internalization rates of each individual ion. In both papers, the authors concluded that the two ions cannot be kinetically distinguished. The explanation given by Hanel and Jencks (9Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is that a slow conformational change corresponding to deocclusion of Ca2+ precedes fast dissociation of Ca2+ from the phosphoenzyme, therefore making the measurement of the individual Ca2+ dissociation steps impossible. The discrepancy between the results of Inesi (5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the one hand and those of Hanel and Jencks (9Hanel A.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) on the other hand is difficult to understand, because they all used similar experimental conditions, typically pH 6.8-7.5, room temperature, 80-100 mM KCl. Here we show that with 300 mM KCl, at pH 8 and 5°C, the lumenal dissociation of the two Ca2+ ions from the phosphorylated ATPase is sequential, as is the cytoplasmic dissociation of the two Ca2+ ions from the nonphosphorylated ATPase. SR vesicles were prepared and tested as described in (1Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from rabbits subjected to a 48-h starvation diet to lower the contamination by phosphorylase(11Cuenda A. Centeno F. Gutierrez-Merino C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 5°C in a cold room, and the buffer was always 100 mM Tes-Tris, pH 8, 300 mM KCl. It was prepared with water filtered through a Milli-Q Water Purification System (Millipore). All salts were added as chlorides. Vesicles were made leaky by an incubation of at least 1 h at 2 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, at room temperature. Kinetic measurements involving [45Ca]Ca2+ or [γ-32P]ATP all started with the same incubation and rinsing steps. Vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) were first incubated in the pH 8 buffer, plus Mg2+, as specified. 1 ml of this suspension was deposited on a filter (Millipore HA 0.45), and the adsorbed vesicles were rinsed with 1 ml of 100 μM EGTA to deprive the enzyme of contaminating Ca2+. For cytoplasmic Ca2+ dissociation experiments, ATPase was converted to the Ca2E state by manually perfusing the filters for 5 s with 1 ml of 10 μM [45Ca]Ca2+. For lumenal Ca2+ dissociation experiments, ATPase was converted to the Ca2E-P state by manually perfusing the filters for 5 s with 2 ml of 100 μM [45Ca]Ca2+ or 45Ca2+, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP or ATP, and Mg2+ as specified. The kinetic measurements were started immediately after this step using a rapid filtration apparatus (Biologic, Claix, France). They were done by perfusing 1 mM EGTA, or 1 mM45Ca2+, plus Mg2+ as specified, for various times. All solutions containing [45Ca]Ca2+ or [γ-32P]ATP also contained 1 mM [3H]glucose, which allows evaluation of the filter wet volume, usually about 30 μl. 3H and 45Ca or 32P retained on the filter were simultaneously measured by scintillation. [γ-32P]ATP or [45Ca]Ca2+ contained in the wet volume was subtracted from the total 32P or 45Ca counts to evaluate the phosphoenzyme and the Ca2+ bound to the ATPase. [45Ca]Ca2+ accumulation in the vesicles was measured in the presence of [45Ca]Ca2+, [3H]glucose, ATP, and Mg2+ as specified. The reaction was started by addition of vesicles at 0.2 mg/ml. After various periods of time, 1 ml of the reaction mixture was deposited on a filter (Millipore HA 0.45), and the radioactivity retained on the filter was counted. Steady-state ATPase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling ATP hydrolysis to NADH oxidation in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.2 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.45 mM NADH, 1-3 mM Mg2+, 0.1-1 mM ATP, 300 mM KCl, at pH 8 and 6-10°C. NADH absorbance variations were followed at 350 nm by an HP 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. If it is assumed that the dissociation of the two Ca2+ ions from the phosphorylated ATPase is intrinsically sequential, the fact that Inesi (5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that the two ions dissociate sequentially, whereas Hanel and Jencks (9Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Orlowski and Champeil (10Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found that the two ions could not be distinguished can simply indicate that this assumption was difficult to prove under their approximately similar conditions. Keeping this in mind, we looked for experimental conditions that would allow measuring an effect of cold Ca2+ on the lumenal dissociation of radioactive Ca2+ bound to the phosphorylated ATPase. Alkaline pH has been shown to increase the affinity of the phosphorylated ATPase for Ca2+(12Verjovski-Almeida S. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and to be even more effective at low temperatures(13de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Also high KCl concentrations are known to favor Ca2E-P, the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme(14Shigekawa M. Akowitz A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4726-4730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 300 mM KCl, pH 8 and 5°C, were the conditions chosen for these experiments, as we expected to have all the ATPase in its Ca2E-P form, with a low ATPase activity and a high enough affinity for lumenal Ca2+ to see an effect of cold Ca2+ on the dissociation of radioactive Ca2+. Ca2+ accumulation in the vesicles and steady-state ATPase activity were measured under the conditions of the Ca2+ dissociation experiments, i.e. 300 mM KCl, pH 8 at 5°C, to check the activity of the enzyme under such conditions. Fig. 1 shows Ca2+ accumulation into the vesicles during 30-min incubation in the presence of 100 μM ATP. With 3 mM Mg2+, tight vesicles accumulated 70 nmol/mg, a value that is comparable with the maximum amount of Ca2+ accumulated into the vesicles under standard conditions (i.e. 80 nmol/mg at pH 6 and 20°C), and the so-called leaky vesicles did not accumulate Ca2+, as was intended. In the absence of Mg2+, accumulation was lower, as expected from slower turnover in the presence of CaATP(15Yamada S. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3108-3119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state ATPase activity was measured as described above, using tight vesicles permeabilized by 4% (w/w) A23187 or leaky vesicles. The steady-state activity measured in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+ and 100 μM ATP was 240 nmol/mg/min at 8°C. Once two radioactive Ca2+ coming from the cytoplasm have been bound to the transport sites of the nonphosphorylated ATPase, excess EGTA induces rapid dissociation of both ions, whereas excess nonradioactive Ca2+ induces rapid dissociation of only one of the two bound Ca2+(2Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This rapidly exchangeable Ca2+ has been identified as the last Ca2+ bound to ATPase(5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5553-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As the dissociation of the other Ca2+ is impaired by the binding of cold Ca2+ at the exchangeable site, it has been identified as the first Ca2+ bound to ATPase(6Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5553-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The two sites are sketched in Fig. 2, which also reports the results of cytoplasmic Ca2+ dissociation experiments under the present conditions, namely using leaky vesicles at pH 8 and 5°C, in the presence of 300 mM KCl. Ca2E was formed by perfusing the vesicles with 10 μM [45Ca]Ca2+ plus 3 mM Mg2+, and dissociation was initiated by perfusing 1 mM EGTA or 1 mM45Ca2+, plus 3 mM Mg2+. EGTA induced biphasic dissociation of Ca2+ ions with rates of 20 and 1 s-1, whereas 45Ca2+ induced dissociation of only half the radioactive Ca2+ with the rate of 9 s-1. This experiment was repeated using tight vesicles that yielded similar rates for cytoplasmic Ca2+ dissociation (data not shown), indicating that the Ca2+ transport sites are not modified by the incubation in EDTA and Tris. Phosphorylated ATPase was formed by perfusing tight vesicles with 100 μM [45Ca]Ca2+, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP, 3 mM Mg2+, 300 mM KCl for 5 s. It was then perfused with 1 mM EGTA plus 3 mM Mg2+ (Fig. 3, open symbols). The amounts of bound [45Ca]Ca2+ and phosphoenzyme were unchanged even after 10 s, indicating that Ca2+ was no longer accessible from the cytoplasmic side. This so-called occluded Ca2+ can be either occluded in the membrane in the Ca2E-P form of ATPase as the Ca2+ bound to this form is not accessible from the cytoplasmic side or it can be occluded inside the vesicles, if ATPase turnover is such that some Ca2+ has been transported during the phosphorylation step(16Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Takisawa H. Makinose M. Nature. 1981; 290: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The existence of these two types of occluded Ca2+ is demonstrated by the effect of ADP, as shown in Fig. 3(closed symbols). Almost all the occluded Ca2+ was trapped in the membrane in the Ca2E-P form of ATPase. Phosphorylated ATPase, prepared as described above, was perfused with a mixture of 300 μM ADP and 1 mM EGTA. At variance with the perfusion with 1 mM EGTA alone, with ADP present there was fast dephosphorylation together with Ca2+ dissociation. This experiment showed that all the phosphoenzyme was ADP sensitive, as expected from the use of 300 mM KCl at low temperature, and that there was 8 nmol/mg calcium accumulated in the vesicle lumen during the phosphorylation step. Phosphorylated ATPase was formed as above, but using leaky vesicles. It was then perfused with 1 mM EGTA plus 3 mM Mg2+ (Fig. 4) or 1 mM45Ca2+ plus 3 mM Mg2+ (Fig. 5). The perfusion with EGTA induced biphasic dissociation of all the bound [45Ca]Ca2+, together with dephosphorylation of ATPase at rates of 0.6 and 0.06 s-1, whereas the perfusion with 45Ca2+ induced biphasic dissociation of [45Ca]Ca2+ at 0.4 and 0.03 s-1 and slow dephosphorylation at 0.03 s-1. To determine whether the phosphoenzyme measured during these perfusions was still the Ca2E-P form of ATPase, its ADP sensitivity was tested at time 0 and after 19 s of perfusion. That is the perfusions with EGTA or 45Ca2+ were followed by manual perfusion of a mixture of 300 μM ADP and 1 mM EGTA for 5 s. These measurements are represented by filled symbols in Figure 4:, Figure 5:. They confirm that after perfusion with EGTA or 45Ca2+, the phosphoenzyme was ADP-sensitive, as it was before perfusion, and that all the Ca2+ bound to the vesicles was bound to the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, as expected from leaky vesicles.Figure 5:Ca2+ exchange from the phosphorylated ATPase (leaky vesicles). ATPase was first phosphorylated as in Fig. 3 and then perfused with 1 mM45Ca2+ plus 3 mM Mg2+ for various times (○, □).

Thus, although in the phosphorylated ATPase the Ca2+ sites are not accessible from the cytoplasm (Fig. 3), they are accessible from the lumen (Fig. 4). The use of leaky vesicles enabled EGTA (Fig. 4) and 45Ca2+ (Fig. 5) to induce Ca2+ dissociation, and moreover, 45Ca2+ impaired dephosphorylation. The stability of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme during the perfusion with 45Ca2+ suggests that half the bound [45Ca]Ca2+ was replaced by 45Ca2+ on the Ca2E-P form of ATPase. This appears clearly in Fig. 6 which shows that the [45Ca]Ca2+/E-P ratio varies from 1.6 to 1 during the perfusion by 45Ca2+, whereas it remains around 1.8 during the dephosphorylation induced by EGTA. In the experiment reported in Figure 4:, Figure 5:, 3 mM Mg2+ were present, together with EGTA or 45Ca2+, in the perfusion buffers. Recalling that the phosphorylation step was done in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+versus 100 μM Ca2+, ATPase was phosphorylated by MgATP, so that we can assume the presence of Mg2+ at the catalytic site of the phosphoenzyme. Nevertheless, during the perfusion with 1 mM45Ca2+ and 3 mM Mg2+, partial substitution of 45Ca2+ for Mg2+ at the catalytic site cannot be excluded. ATPase turnover with CaATP as substrate is known to be much slower than with MgATP, possibly because of slower dissociation of Ca2+ from the Ca2E-P form when it has Ca2+ at its catalytic site(15Yamada S. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3108-3119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a substitution at the catalytic site during the perfusion could induce a slow phase in the Ca2+ dissociation kinetics that would be difficult to distinguish from a slow phase due to sequential dissociation from the transport sites. This possibility was tested by repeating the experiment described in Fig. 5 with various Mg2+ concentrations. Phosphorylated ATPase was formed as described in the legend to Fig. 5 and perfused with 1 mM45Ca2+ and either no added Mg2+ or 1, 3, or 5 mM Mg2+ (Fig. 7). The concentration of Mg2+ did not significantly modify the Ca2+ dissociation kinetics, as 45Ca2+ impaired dissociation of half the bound [45Ca]Ca2+ and dephosphorylation. The rate of the fast phase was 0.2-0.5 s-1, whereas the rate of the slow phase was the same as that of the phosphoenzyme, 0.02-0.03 s-1. If a Mg2+/Ca2+ exchange was to take place at the catalytic site during the perfusion, one would expect the amplitudes and the rates of the fast and slow phases to be modified by the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio in the perfusion buffer. It is therefore more likely that the observed slow phase corresponds to a non-exchangeable Ca2+. Understanding how Ca2+ is transported from the cytoplasm to the SR lumen requires some knowledge of the Ca2+ binding sites on the different forms of ATPase. In the absence of ATP, when there is no turnover, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ binding reaction (step 4 in Fig. S1) has been well characterized, as it can be studied both kinetically and at equilibrium (1Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 2072-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The situation is different for the Ca2+ binding sites on the phosphorylated ATPase (step 2 in Fig. S1), which should be studied during turnover. Knowledge of the lumenal affinity for Ca2+ can be obtained with tight vesicles loaded with Ca2+. For instance, the study of phosphoenzyme formation from Pi in the presence of various lumenal Ca2+ concentrations has yielded information on the lumenal affinity for Ca2+, which was found in the millimolar range at pH 7 and 20°C(22Prager R. Punzengruber C. Kolassa N. Winkler F. Suko J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 97: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Direct access to the Ca2+ binding sites on E-P requires working with leaky vesicles. In this case, as the affinity of the lumenal sites is lower than that of the cytoplasmic sites, addition of Ca2+ to E-P induces dephosphorylation and Ca2+ binding to E(23Guimaraes-Motta H. de Meis L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, de Meis et al. (13de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) have shown that working on leaky vesicles ATP could be synthesized in the absence of a Ca2+ gradient, provided that a mixture of Ca2+ and ADP was added to E-P. In this paper, ATP synthesis was studied as a function of the Ca2+ concentration under various conditions that yielded other estimations of the luminal affinity for Ca2+. Of particular interest is that at pH 8 and 0°C, half the maximal amount of ATP synthesized was obtained with 10 μM Ca2+, instead of 300 μM at pH 8 and 30°C or pH 7 and 0°C. Although these numbers should not be taken as absolute values for Ca2+ affinity, it is likely that alkaline pH and low temperature are conditions that increase the lumenal affinity for Ca2+. In the absence of any known possibility to measure Ca2+ binding to the phosphoenzyme directly, we have studied Ca2+ dissociation from phosphorylated ATPase toward the vesicle lumen using the rapid filtration technique. The experimental conditions were chosen to yield (i) as high as possible lumenal affinity for Ca2+, i.e. an affinity high enough to use reasonable concentrations of 45Ca2+ to compete with bound [45Ca]Ca2+, (ii) as much as possible Ca2+-bound phosphoenzyme, (iii) as low as possible ATPase activity, in order to have enough ATP in the 30-μl wet volume of the filter to maintain the ATPase phosphorylated during the few seconds necessary to start the rapid filtration experiment. All three requirements were achieved while working at pH 8, 5°C, 300 mM KCl and using 100 μM ATP for phosphorylation. Under these conditions, the ATPase activity was effectively low, and the vesicles were able to accumulate Ca2+ (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:) showing that the ATPase cycled normally. After phosphorylation, the phosphoenzyme was ADP-sensitive, and there were two Ca2+ bound per phosphoenzyme (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Thus, the vast majority of ATPase was in the Ca2E-P form, in which Ca2+ is said to be occluded, because it cannot be released on the cytoplasmic side unless the ATPase has bound ADP. When this occluded Ca2+ was formed in leaky vesicles, perfusion with EGTA simultaneously induced dissociation of the two Ca2+ ions and dephosphorylation, as expected from the fact that hydrolysis of E-P, the Ca2+-deprived phosphoenzyme, is fast in the presence of KCl(14Shigekawa M. Akowitz A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4726-4730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The luminal Ca2+ dissociation, i.e. the EGTA-induced dissociation of Ca2+ from Ca2E-P (Fig. 4) was slow compared with the cytoplasmic dissociation of Ca2+ from Ca2E (Fig. 2). It is likely that this slow rate illustrates Ca2+ deocclusion from the Ca2+-bound phosphoenzyme. Keeping in mind that hydrolysis of E-P is fast with KCl present and that the ADP sensitivity is lost together with Ca2+ dissociation, the fact that both the dephosphorylation and the Ca2+ dissociation are biphasic suggests that there is an equilibrium between two forms of Ca2E-P. One form, denoted as [Ca2]E-P, would bear occluded Ca2+, and the other form would be able to exchange Ca2+ with the lumen. Thus, biphasic dissociation of Ca2+ and biphasic dephosphorylation would be due to a fast dissociation of Ca2+ from the non-occluded form and the slow conversion of the occluded form into the non-occluded form. At this point, more details on the luminal dissociation of Ca2+ come from the Ca2+ exchange experiments. Comparison of the Ca2+ exchange experiments performed on the phosphorylated ATPase (Fig. 5) and on the nonphosphorylated ATPase (Fig. 2) shows that cytoplasmic Ca2+ exchange was faster than lumenal Ca2+ exchange. On the cytoplasmic side, this exchange is explained by the following sequence, where the departure of one 45Ca2+ is followed by the binding of one 45Ca2+. The same sequence on the phosphorylated ATPase suggests the existence of an intermediate phosphoenzyme having bound only one 45Ca2+ and able to bind one 45Ca2+. Taking into account the occluded state, Ca2+ exchange on the phosphorylated ATPase can be described by the following sequence. REACTION 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Such a sequence would provide a stable phosphoenzyme in the presence of cold Ca2+. In the absence of lumenal Ca2+, sequential dissociation of both Ca2+ ions would thus occur following. Our data show a close similarity between the transport sites of the nonphosphorylated ATPase that are accessible from the cytoplasm and those of the phosphorylated ATPase that are accessible from the vesicle lumen. In both states, the transport sites interact with each other as bulk Ca2+ impairs the dissociation of one of the two Ca2+ bound. Our results agree with the conclusion of Inesi (5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose model includes luminal sequential dissociation, but they differ from those of Hanel and Jencks (9Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Orlowski and Champeil (10Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) who found that the two Ca2+ ions could not be distinguished once the ATPase was phosphorylated. As stated above, this discrepancy is probably due to the difference in the experimental conditions. For instance, at room temperature the luminal affinity for Ca2+ is low and the ATPase activity is high, so that it is necessary to phosphorylate ATPase and to exchange cold Ca2+ for radioactive Ca2+ simultaneously, i.e. to perfuse at least 10 mM45Ca2+ and ATP together. In this case, an ATP/ADP-mediated Mg2+/Ca2+ exchange can occur in the filter, leading to various populations of phosphoenzymes displaying different rates at step 2 in Fig. S1, as discussed by Orlowski and Champeil (10Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, there was only 1 mM45Ca2+ perfused, and ATP and ADP were washed out of the filter after the first 25 ms of perfusion; thus, there was very little possibility to have an ATP/ADP-mediated Mg2+/Ca2+ exchange at the catalytic site. There still remains the possibility that the effect of cold Ca2+ is due to a direct substitution of Ca2+ for Mg2+ at the catalytic site. Fig. 7 shows that this was not the case, because varying the Mg2+ concentration during the Ca2+ exchange did not change its kinetics. Finally, as Hanel and Jencks (9Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found the same rate of internalization of Ca2+ whether they monitored internalization of both ions or each individual ion into empty or Ca2+-loaded vesicles, they suggested that they could only measure a slow deocclusion rate preceding the Ca2+ dissociation steps. This slow deocclusion step was also seen in our experiments, but at variance with Hanel and Jencks(9Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we observed different effects when EGTA or 45Ca2+ was used. Thus, the comparison between their results and ours suggests that the experimental conditions modify the equilibrium between the occluded and deoccluded states of Ca2+ on the phosphoenzyme. Under our conditions, there would be enough Ca2+ in the deoccluded state to observe the dissociation of the first ion and thus the impairment of the dissociation of the second ion in the presence of cold Ca2+. Our finding that Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphorylated enzyme is sequential, as is Ca2+ binding to the nonphosphorylated enzyme, suggests at first sight that during the transport cycle, the Ca2+ ions cross the membrane sequentially via a channel-like structure such as the one sketched here. Nevertheless, a few points should be emphasized. First, a channel-like structure is obviously the simplest way to describe the interactions between the two Ca2+ sites, but it is not the only one. Second, a channel-like structure also suggests that the first ion bound to the cytoplasmic sites is the first ion to dissociate toward the lumen. Such a first-in-first-out model has been suggested by Inesi(5Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, there is a controversy about the possibility to have a channel-like structure crossing the membrane and including the putative Ca2+ sites. Site-directed mutagenesis has yielded information on the location of the Ca2+ sites, as six charged residues from the membrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8 (Glu309, Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908) were shown to be crucial for Ca2+ transport(24Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and among them, the five residues belonging to M4, M5, and M6 were shown to be crucial for Ca2+ occlusion(25Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to Inesi (27Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 554-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), M4, M5, M6, and M8 could form a channel providing the residues coordinating the two Ca2+ ions at its inner surface. According to Andersen(28Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the three residues belonging to M6 cannot at the same time coordinate the two Ca2+ ions and be part of the same α-helix. We have shown here that the lumenal dissociation of the Ca2+ ions is compatible with a channel-like structure, because it is sequential. However, we did not try to obtain any information about what happens in the occluded state, as we did not follow a specified Ca2+ ion, i.e. the first or the second, from the cytoplasmic side to the lumenal side."

Prolidase is a widely occurring mammalian dipeptidase that normally splits aminoacylprolines into the constituent amino acids. Apparently the enzyme is required because many other catabolic enzymes are unable to cleave the RCO-proline tertiary carboxamide linkage(1Bizzozero S.A. Zweifel B.O. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), so that C-terminal proline-containing dipeptides build to toxic concentrations in individuals identified with a genetically caused deficiency of prolidase(2Yaron A.

We now extend kinetic analysis to picolinylprolines, a new class of substrate analogues that affords unique insight into the catalytic mechanism. Prolidase from a number of sources has been shown to exist in solution as a dimer of 55-kDa subunits, each of which consists of an identical single chain(10Manao G. Nassi P. Capuggi G. Camici G.

Lancaster G.L. Choy F.Y.M. Hechtman P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 67: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A crystallographic structure for prolidase is unavailable, but the human enzyme has been sequenced(16Endo F. Tanoue A. Nakai H. Hata A. Indo Y. Titani K. Matsuda I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4476-4481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tanoue A. Endo F. Matsuda I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11306-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, apparent sequence homology has been demonstrated with Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase, a metalloenzyme of established three-dimensional structure, as well as with aminopeptidase P, which also preferentially hydrolyzes an acylproline linkage(18Roderick S.L. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 19Bazan J.F. Weaver L.H. Roderick S.L. Huber R. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because these enzymes have a similar function and specificity (namely, for cleavage of the N-terminal residue from a peptide), it is reasonable to infer that they share a common mechanism, which may be general for aminopeptidases. The related and structurally solved methionine aminopeptidase from E. coli differs from the better-characterized metalloproteases in that it contains a pair of closely linked metal ions at the active site (reportedly Co2+ for optimum activity), rather than a single coordinatively bound cationic center. This binary-metal characteristic, employing Zn2+, is shared by leucine aminopeptidase (which has an unrelated chain-fold conformation, however)(21Burley S.K. David P.R. Taylor A. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Burley S.K. David P.R. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1992; 224: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). An aminopeptidase from Aeromonas proteolytica has also been solved, and it conforms to the pattern of dual metal ions at the active site(24Chevrier B. Schalk C. D'Orchymont H. Rondeau J.-M. Moras D. Tarnus C. Structure. 1994; 2: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presently uncertain chemical mechanism of these aminopeptidases must involve unique features relative to such lone-metal enzymes as carboxypeptidase A or thermolysin(25Taylor A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Prolidase has long been recognized as a metallopeptidase. Because its standard isolation procedure specifies incorporation of aqueous Mn2+ (at much higher than physiological concentrations), that element has been thought to be involved in the enzyme mechanism. However, our investigations have suggested that this particular metal ion is not of great importance, and while it seems to have a stabilizing role for some enzyme preparations, there is no direct evidence that manganese rather than the more common Zn2+, for example, is an obligatory active site component. (We find no advantage to the standard post-isolation Mn2+ incubation in our current enzyme procurement, and do not use it). Because various divalent transition metal ions possessing similar chemical properties are functionally interchangeable in other metalloproteases(26Allen M.P. Yamada A.H. Carpenter F.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3778-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Thompson G.A. Carpenter F.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), atomic identity may be regarded as a less essential point compared to the broader question of mechanistic role that is here addressed by structure-activity relationships among substrates. Prolidase (EC 3.4.13.9) was isolated from fresh swine kidneys by a modification of the procedure of Manao et al.(10Manao G. Nassi P. Capuggi G. Camici G. Ramponi G. Physiol. Chem. Phys. 1972; 4: 75-87PubMed Google Scholar). The steps involve (i) formation of an acetone powder from the filtrate of homogenized kidneys, (ii) ammonium sulfate and acetone fractionation followed by lyophilization, and (iii) final chromatographic purification. The first two steps were carried out as described previously, except that ethanolic phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (150 mg/liter) was incorporated in the homogenization mixture as a serine protease inhibitor. Without this precaution the final 55-kDa enzyme obtained was found by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be contaminated with proteins of Mr of approximately 20,000 and 35,000. A commercially obtained specimen of prolidase was found to consist mostly of the latter mixture. The apparent chain nicking does not have observable kinetic consequences except at the low-pH end of the catalytic efficacy range, where the evidently fragmented enzyme loses activity that the protected material does not. Also, the intact enzyme was found not to benefit kinetically or in terms of stability from the aqueous Mn2+ incubation procedure that hitherto has been stipulated for prolidase, and consequently that “activation” was not applied by us. Step iii, chromatographic purification, was in our case carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with a 15-cm polymeric hydroxyethyl methacrylate, macroporous, amine-type ion-exchange column (Alltech, packing: HEMA-IEC BIO 1000 DEAE 10U), employing an eluent of 0.05 M Tris, 0.4 N NaCl, pH of 7.9, and with monitoring at 280 nm. After pressure-induced dialytic concentration of the dipeptidolytically active fraction, this gave high activity prolidase as a single band with Mr of 55,000 according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and with Mr of approximately 110,000 (dimer) when the electrophoresis was carried out without protein denaturation. Crude (unchromatographed) enzyme gave with some substrates Km values approximately twice that obtained with purified enzyme, suggesting adventitious inhibition, but with otherwise similar kinetic behavior. The crude preparation was used for estimating rates with some very slowly cleaved substrates, where adequate amounts of purified prolidase could not be secured for the purpose. Picolinylprolines were generally prepared by coupling the appropriately substituted picolinic acids to L-proline methyl ester with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, with subsequent saponification.

Enzymic hydrolyses were followed at 25.0 (± 0.1)°C by continuous spectrophotometric analysis, following the decrease in light absorption at a suitable wavelength in the range 230-240 nm (region of significant pyridine-ring absorption) subsequent to addition of 1-20 μl of purified enzyme to 2.5 ml of buffered substrate solution. Relative rates (kcat/Km) are in every case expressed as a fraction of the limiting maximum activity for glycylproline substrate similarly determined. Estimated enzyme concentrations are typically in the micro- to nanomolar range. Buffers employed were MES, pH of 5.3-6.9, PIPES, pH of 7.1-7.7, CHES, pH of ≥8.1 (all shown not to perturb kinetics). The method of initial rates was employed with a computer-assisted line fitting procedure; kinetic parameters were secured from a direct fit of v/[E] to the Michaelis-Menten equation using substrate concentrations spanning at least two points with values below Km and two above. Catalysis was shown to be first-order in enzyme at the concentrations employed. In all kinetic runs v/[E] was adjusted so as to avoid complications from slow cis-trans isomerization in the substrate(39King G.F. Middlehurst C.R. Kuchel P.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Lin L.-N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hydrazinolysis kinetics for ethyl picolinates were carried out similarly, except that rate constants were obtained by exponential curve fitting to the complete pseudo-first-order kinetic runs. Enzymic cleavage products were detected by thin layer chromatographic analysis, with comparison to authentic materials. Chelative metal ion dissociation constants for 1 and for the corresponding picolinic acids were secured by spectrophotometric titration in aqueous solution. At a fixed pH (varying from 2 to 6.5, depending on substrate), a 0.1 mM solution of the picolinate was allowed to coordinate with varying concentrations of metal ion, Mn2+ or Zn2+. The family of resulting spectra commonly exhibited perturbations having an isosbestic point, and plotting of neighboring absorption readings versus log [M2+] yielded sigmoidal curves from which the extent of chelation could be quantified. Dissociation constants, Kd, were obtained by fitting absorptions to the expression A − A0 = ΔA/{1 + (Kd/[M2+])•(1 + [H+]/Ka)}, where Ka is an acid dissociation constant for competing nitrogen protonation previously determined. All pH values in this article are calibrated pH meter readings uncorrected for ionic strength effects. Tolerances listed are standard errors from least-squares analysis. Ordinarily, prolidase behaves as an obligatory aminopeptidase. As earlier shown, the prototypical substrate glycylproline is cleaved readily, but acetylproline is hydrolyzed >104-fold more slowly, even though the latter NH2-abridged analogue binds comparably as well when employed as an inhibitor of the enzyme (with allowance for pH effects)(8Mock W.L. Green P.C. Boyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19600-19605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mock W.L. Green P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19606-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acylglycylprolines also are not substrates(41Davis N.C. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 261-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contemplation of the enzyme mechanism prompted us to attempt amide-bond cleavage by prolidase of a dipeptide surrogate, picolinylproline. It proved to be an excellent substrate, with spectral properties providing a convenient continuous spectrophotometric kinetic analysis. That has led to a systematic investigation of the potential prolidase substrates depicted in Fig. 1. Although picolinylproline (1-H) is cleaved comparably rapidly as the normal substrate glycylproline, isomers nicotinylproline (2) and isonicotinylproline (3) were not detectably hydrolyzed by swine-kidney prolidase. This result, in conjunction with the inertness of acetylproline and other specificity studies previously reported(8Mock W.L. Green P.C. Boyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19600-19605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led to a conjecture that productive binding of substrates to prolidase requires a chelative interaction between an active site metal ion and the N terminus of the substrate. Specifically, coordination is postulated to involve the oxygen atom of the scissile carboxamide together with an unprotonated amino group (of the glycyl residue) or the heteroaromatic nitrogen (of the picolinyl residue), with both carbonyl and nitrogen functionality simultaneously interacting electrodatively with an active site Lewis acid. The pH dependence of enzymic catalysis in the case of physiological dipeptide substrates has been shown to be compatible with such an interpretation(8Mock W.L. Green P.C. Boyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19600-19605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because that interaction should respond in an informative manner to variation in basicity within the pyridine nitrogen in 1, the series of 4-substituted picolinylprolines shown in Fig. 1 was prepared for submission to prolidase. The proton affinity of a pyridine nitrogen depends strongly upon the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing properties of ring substituents that are situated para to it. This is demonstrated by the pKa values from ring protonation of the various members of the substrate series having structure 1, which as listed in Table 1 cover a range of >8 pK units. These are microscopic pKa values, specifically for protonation on nitrogen, inasmuch as they have been obtained by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The method involves preparation of an aqueous solution (containing ~5% D2O) of the picolinylproline derivative, and recording of the chemical shift of the methine carbon ortho to the aromatic ring nitrogen for various pH values. When δ13C is plotted against pH, a sigmoidal curve results, from which the pKa value can be ascertained analytically. Although the substrate carboxyl group ionizes concurrently in some cases (and may also be assigned a pKa value from its chemical shift dependence), that causes no interference with measurement of pyridine basicity by this technique.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Because a substantial dependence upon the nature of the ring substituent is noted in the enzymic rate of amide bond scission for various representatives of 1, it became desirable to examine independently the intrinsic acyl-group reactivities of such pyridinecarboxylic acid derivatives. The innate influence of the substituent upon addition to the picolinyl C=O group was weighed by measuring the relative rates of nonenzymic hydrazinolysis of ethyl esters of the picolinic acids utilized in this investigation. Under the conditions employed, the acylhydrazide-forming reaction of esters ordinarily is second-order in N2H4, and the rate-limiting step is thought to be attack of nucleophile on the carbonyl group, with general base assistance by a second hydrazine molecule(42Blackburn G.M. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 2638-2645Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Second-order dependence on hydrazine was confirmed for the ethyl picolinates. As anticipated because the reacting carbonyl group is cross-conjugated with respect to the substituent borne by the pyridine ring, the latter was found to have only a small effect upon the velocity of the acyl substitution reaction in the case of the esters. Respective pseudo-first-order rate constants for a hydrazine concentration of 1 M are listed in Table 1. When log kN2H4 is plotted versus pKa values for ring-nitrogen protonation of the corresponding picolinic acid anions (with pKavalues measured as for the substrates), a linear dependence is seen, with a Brcoefficient slope of −0.06 (±0.03). Exactly the same coefficient is obtained when the hydrazinolysis rate constants for the esters are plotted logarithmically against the pKavalues for 1. From the low absolute magnitude of this parameter (reflecting the similarity of rates), there appears to be relatively little direct interaction between the ring substituent and the reaction center in the course of acyl transfer. The kinetics of picolinylproline hydrolysis by prolidase show a different pH profile than observed for the normal substrate glycylproline. Illustrative data are presented in Fig. 2 for the specificity constant kcat/Km (the second-order rate constant for enzymic amide hydrolysis at low substrate concentration). This kinetic parameter is particularly valuable in identifying functionality involved in the enzyme mechanism, for in most instances pH-induced perturbations of the so-measured catalytic activity yield true pKa values of the groups responsible, either for binding of substrate or for participation within the first committed step of the catalytic cycle. The dependence for glycylproline is bell-shaped, with peak activity near neutral pH and with delimiting pKa values of 6.6 and 8.8 (Fig. 2, inset). However, that for 1-H is merely sigmoidal with the maximum in acidic solution and with the single governing pKa having a value of ~6.6, matching the acidic-limb pKa for glycylproline, but with an opposite inflection. Similar behavior was observed previously and has been explained(8Mock W.L. Green P.C. Boyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19600-19605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The key realization is that an essential enzymic functionality with a pKa value of 6.6 exists within the active site of prolidase and that it controls binding of substrates absolutely, according to the pH profiles. Obviously from the data that group must adopt its conjugate acid form for productive association and catalytic conversion of chelating substrates such as picolinylproline. Because the control exerted is absolute (the enzymic rate drops to zero at high pH), the most plausible interpretation would seem to be that a water molecule that binds to an active site metal ion in the absence of substrate has become acidified to this pKa value by the enzyme(5Mock W.L. Freeman D.J. Aksamawati M. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Mock W.L. Green P.C. Boyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19600-19605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While pyridine ligands are capable of displacing H2O from a metal ion, they cannot compete as coordinating agents with HO-. The same explanation holds for glycylproline as well. In the bell-shaped pH profile for that substrate, the alkaline limb inflection (pKa≈ 8.8) must be attributed to the glycyl NH2 group within the substrate. This has been experimentally confirmed previously by an engendering of small offsets in the substrate's titrimetric pKa value, as purposely introduced by N-substituents on the glycyl residue, with those pKa perturbations detected also in the catalytic kinetics(8Mock W.L. Green P.C. Boyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19600-19605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While at first glance it might appear from the pH profile that the substrate ammonium ion is the species bound in the case of glycylproline, that is an illusion. Binding of the conjugate base form of the substrate (unprotonated amine) to the conjugate acid form of the enzyme (as for picolinylproline) produces exactly the same pH dependence as if the protonation states were reversed. The validity of this unitary explanation for all kinds of substrates for prolidase is confirmed by 1-N(CH3)OCH3 and 1-N(CH3)CH2CF3. For these picolinyl substrates the pyridine-ring pKavalue falls within the window of pH values that can be examined kinetically. They show the bell-shaped pH profile of dipeptide substrates, with delimiting pKa values congruent with that of enzyme (alkaline limb pKa of ~7) and of the picolinyl ring (acidic limb pKa of 5.6-5.8). Substrate 1-N(CH3)2 was hydrolyzed too slowly by prolidase for measurement of an adequate pH profile, but qualitative observations suggest that it conforms to the pattern of the other picolinylprolines, and a corresponding relative rate constant could be estimated from the Michaelis profile at a single intermediate pH. The alternative supposition, that the N-cationic form of substrate (e.g. glycyl-ammonium ion in GlyPro) is the catalytically active species, breaks down in particular for 1-CN, which is one of the more competent prolidase substrates in spite of yielding a negligibly small amount of pyridinium ion in the pH region of enzymic activity (estimated pKa≈−1.6). Furthermore, any conjectured preferential enzymic binding of pyridinium ions from 1 seems incompatible with the substantial rate dependence upon hetero-ring basicity seen in Fig. 2, inasmuch as all such substrates in their protonated form should be equivalently cationic as regards ion pairing within the active site. Our conclusion that observed kcat/Kmperturbations as a function of pH are connected with productive substrate ligation to a metal ion, rather than being the manifestation of a subsequent kinetic step in the catalytic mechanism, is corroborated by prolidase inhibition studies, wherein a cognate pattern has been seen for enzymic equilibrium association of catalytically inert substrate analogues that are also metal ion interacting(9Mock W.L. Green P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19606-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the strictures provided by the pH profiles (Fig. 2), there evidently is a profound dependence of catalytic velocity upon the nature of the 4-substituent within the picolinyl moiety, with the less basic pyridines yielding the superior substrates. The overall dependence upon nitrogen basicity seems greater than can be explained by the relative nucleophile susceptibilities of the carbonyl groups within the substrates, as was estimated by hydrazinolysis. Values for limiting kcat/Km rate constants on the acidic limb (corrected for substrate protonation as necessary) are listed in Table 1, together with the enzymic pKa value (~6.6) obtained also by curve fitting in each case. The pattern of kinetic behavior (dependence upon pH and substituent) provides the basis for formulation of a detailed catalytic mechanism, as is subsequently considered under “Discussion.” Because of the preceding evidence indicating that chelation involving the picolinyl residue is a obligatory feature of productive substrate binding, it became necessary to acquire independent substantiation as to how that might depend upon pyridine basicity. Dissociation constants (practical values) for the complexation of aqueous Zn2+ with various 4-substituted picolinic acids were obtained by spectrophotometric analysis. Some results are summarized in Fig. 3, wherein a satisfactory linear free energy relationship may be noted between nitrogen basicity (pKa value for uncompl"
https://openalex.org/W2060687144,"Retinoic acid receptor-β (RAR-β) specifically binds retinoic acid (RA) and functions as a RA-inducible transcriptional regulatory factor. Simultaneous mutation of Arg269 and Lys220 of RAR-β to Ala results in a dramatic reduction in both transactivation and affinity for RA along with creating a RA concentration-dependent dominant negative mutant. In this report, we found that mutation of these two amino acid residues singly and simultaneously to Gln results in mutant RAR-βs, each displaying a more dramatic reduction in transactivation and affinity for RA than their corresponding Ala mutant, with the R269Q more profoundly affected than K220Q. Furthermore, we examined both the Ala and Gln mutants for their ability to transactivate and bind two other retinoids with different functional end groups (all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal). Mutation of Lys220 to either an Ala or a Gln favors transactivation and binding of retinal, while mutation of either Lys220 or Arg269 to Gln favors retinol transactivation and binding. Taken together, these results suggest that Arg269 and Lys220 lie within the ligand binding pocket of RAR-β and that these two amino acid residues play an important role in determining retinoid specificity most likely by directly interacting with the carboxylate group of RA. Retinoic acid receptor-β (RAR-β) specifically binds retinoic acid (RA) and functions as a RA-inducible transcriptional regulatory factor. Simultaneous mutation of Arg269 and Lys220 of RAR-β to Ala results in a dramatic reduction in both transactivation and affinity for RA along with creating a RA concentration-dependent dominant negative mutant. In this report, we found that mutation of these two amino acid residues singly and simultaneously to Gln results in mutant RAR-βs, each displaying a more dramatic reduction in transactivation and affinity for RA than their corresponding Ala mutant, with the R269Q more profoundly affected than K220Q. Furthermore, we examined both the Ala and Gln mutants for their ability to transactivate and bind two other retinoids with different functional end groups (all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal). Mutation of Lys220 to either an Ala or a Gln favors transactivation and binding of retinal, while mutation of either Lys220 or Arg269 to Gln favors retinol transactivation and binding. Taken together, these results suggest that Arg269 and Lys220 lie within the ligand binding pocket of RAR-β and that these two amino acid residues play an important role in determining retinoid specificity most likely by directly interacting with the carboxylate group of RA. Retinoic acid (RA), ( 1The abbreviations used are: RAretinoic acidRARretinoic acid receptorRXRretinoid X receptorRAREretinoic acid response elementPCRpolymerase chain reactionβ-galβ-galactosidaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. )a vitamin A metabolite, is necessary for a diverse group of biological processes including growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis (for review, see (1Gudas L. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1993: 443-520Google Scholar)). These actions of RA are mediated by a group of nuclear proteins, which belong to the multigene family of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, termed retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (for review, see (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1993: 319-350Google Scholar)). RARs and RXRs are RA-inducible transcriptional regulatory factors that transduce the RA signal at the level of gene expression via retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) and retinoid X response elements. Both all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA have been demonstrated to be ligands for the RARs, whereas only 9-cis-RA has been shown to be a ligand for RXRs(3Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B.

In addition, seven isoforms of RAR-α and RAR-γ and four isoforms of RAR-β are produced as a result of a combination of differential promoter usage and alternative splicing(10Zelent A. Krust A.

The isoforms of each RAR contain a common DNA binding and ligand binding domain with unique amino-terminal sequences. These unique amino-terminal sequences have been proposed to modulate the transcriptional activities of each isoform(14Nagpal S. Zelent A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, each of the RAR subtypes and their isoforms display a distinctive spatial and temporal pattern of expression during development, implying specific nonoverlapping functions(15Dolle P.

RARs are composed of six structurally distinct domains referred to as domains A-F(2Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1993: 319-350Google Scholar). Domain C (DNA binding domain) and domain E (ligand binding domain) of RARs are highly conserved, demonstrating greater than 90 and 75% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. Structural analysis of the DNA binding domains of RARs using NMR spectroscopy has demonstrated them to contain two putative zinc fingers formed by the first eight conserved cysteine residues(19Knegtel R.M.A. Boelens R. Ganadu M.L. George A.V.E. van der Saag P.T. Kaptein R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Little structural information is available concerning the ligand binding domains of RARs; however, several retinoid analogues have been designed, which display quite different specificities for each of the RAR subtypes(20Allenby G. Bocquel M.-T. Saunders M. Kazmer S. Speck J. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Kastner P. Grippo J.F. Chambon P. Levin A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that the three-dimensional conformation of the retinoid binding site of each RAR is somewhat unique despite the high degree of amino acid sequence homology. Recently, we have reported that Arg269 and Lys220 of RAR-β together play an important role in binding of RA, possibly by interacting with the negatively charged carboxylate group of RA(27Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, simultaneous mutation of Arg269 and Lys220 of RAR-β to Ala (K220A/R269A) resulted in a 500-fold elevation in the EC50 value for all-trans-RA in transactivation assays and a 580-fold increase in the apparent Kd for all-trans-RA. In addition, K220A/R269A acted as a dominant negative mutant when transfected with the three RAR subtypes in a RA concentration-dependent fashion. In this report, we have further examined the role of Arg269 and Lys220 of RAR-β in the binding of ligand by preparing and assaying mutants of RAR-β, in which either singly (K220Q and R269Q) or simultaneously (K220Q/R269Q) these two positively charged amino acids have been changed to Gln. Each of the Gln mutants displayed a greater decrease in RA-dependent functional activity and RA affinity when compared with their corresponding Ala mutant, with R269Q more profoundly affected than K220Q. In addition, mutation of either of these two amino acid residues individually to Ala or Gln resulted in the creation of a number of unique mutant receptors (K220Q, R269Q, and K220A), which display an increased transactivation activity and affinity for all-trans-retinol and/or all-trans-retinal compared with that of the wild type receptor. Taken together, these data suggest that Arg269 and Lys220 lie within the ligand binding pocket of RAR-β and that these two amino acid residues play an important role in determining retinoid specificity of RAR-β most likely by directly interacting with the carboxylate group of RA. The entire coding sequences of mouse RAR-β2 cDNA cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pSG5 (pSG5-RARβ), was a generous gift from Prof. Pierre Chambon (Strasbourg, France) (11Kastner P. Krust A. Mendelsohn C. Garnier J.-M. Zelent A. Leroy P. Staub A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The wild type RAR-β and the mutants K220A, R269A, and K220A/R269A were previously described(27Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three additional mutants of wild type RAR-β were prepared in which Lys220 was replaced with Gln (K220Q), Arg269 was replaced with Gln (R269Q) and a double mutant in which Lys220 and Arg269 were each replaced with Gln (K220Q/R269Q). In each case, the CAG codon was used to encode the mutant Gln indicated in bold and underlined in the mutagenic primers shown below. The three Gln mutants were prepared by PCR site-directed mutagenesis(28Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were purchased from the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Laboratory at Temple University School of Medicine or Ransom Hill Biosciences. Sense primers are indicated as s and antisense primers as as. XbaI-linearized pSG5-RARβ was used as the template for the single mutants. For K220Q, two PCR fragments were synthesized using the primer pairs RARβ-5s (5’-GGGAGGGATCCATCGAGGGTAGATTTGACTGTATGGAT-3’) plus K220Q-as (5’-CTCACTGAACTGGTCCCAGAG-3’) and RARβ-3as (5’-GAAGGAAGCTTTCACTGCAGCAGTGGTGA-3’) plus K220Q-s (5’-CTCTGGGACCAGTTCAGTGAG-3’), respectively. The two PCR fragments were purified, annealed, and amplified in a second PCR reaction using the primers RARβ-5s and RARβ-3as. The SacI-BstXI restriction fragment that contained the mutation was exchanged with that of the wild type pSG5-RARβ to create the pSG5-RARβ-K220Q mutant expression vector. The pSG5-RARβ-R269Q mutant was prepared in a similar manner except that (i) the two mutagenic primers were R269Q-as (5’-TGGGGTATACTGGGTACAAT-3’) and R269Q-s (5’-ATTTGTACCCAGTATACCCCA-3’) and (ii) the EcoRV-BstXI restriction fragment of the final PCR product was exchanged with that of the wild type pSG5-RARβ. Finally the double mutant pSG5-RARβ-K220Q/R269Q expression vector was prepared exactly the same as the K220Q mutant, except that the template DNA was XbaI-linearized pSG5-RARβ-R269Q DNA. All clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis using the Sanger methodology (29Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref Scopus (2190) Google Scholar) and Sequenase version II. No codon mutations were found in the entire RAR-β2 coding sequences except for the desired mutations. The ability of each mutant protein to bind DNA and dimerize was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts prepared from cells transfected with each of the mutant constructs as previously described(27Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transactivation assays were performed essentially as previously described(20Allenby G. Bocquel M.-T. Saunders M. Kazmer S. Speck J. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Kastner P. Grippo J.F. Chambon P. Levin A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 30Soprano D.R. Tairis N. Gyda M. Harnish D. Jiang H. Soprano K.J. Kochhar D.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 122: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, CV-1 cells were plated at 500,000 cells/60-mm dish. The next day, the cells were transfected with a total of 12 μg of DNA (4 μg of wild type or mutant pSG5-RARβ expression construct, 4 μg of RARE-CAT reporter construct obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Ronald Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), and 4 μg of pRSV-β-gal) by Ca2+ phosphate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h later, the cells were treated with various concentrations of all-trans-RA, all-trans-retinol, or all-trans-retinal ranging from 10-10 to 10-5M prepared in ethanol. Control cells were treated with identical volumes of ethanol. After an additional 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity (31Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity(32Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized with respect to β-gal activity to control for transfection efficiency and expressed as a percentage of relative CAT activity. The normalized CAT activity of wild type RAR-β at 10-6M all-trans-RA was chosen as 100% relative CAT activity. The EC50 values for the wild type and each of the mutants represent the concentration of retinoid that resulted in 50% of the maximal activity of wild type RAR-β determined by extrapolation from the plotted points. For the dominant negative mutant experiments, the transactivation assays were performed essentially as described above with the following exceptions. CV-1 cells were transfected with a total of 20 μg of DNA (3 μg of wild type pSG5-RARβ expression construct, 4 μg of RARE-CAT reporter construct, 4 μg of pRSV-β-gal, and 9 μg of the RAR-β mutant construct or pSG5 carrier DNA). This resulted in a 1:3 molar ratio of wild type RAR-β DNA to mutant RAR-β DNA. In some experiments, the cells were treated with either 10-8 or 10-6M all-trans-RA. In other experiments, the cells were treated with a combination of 10-8M all-trans-RA and either all-trans-retinol (10-7 or 10-5M) or all-trans-retinal (10-8 or 10-6M). Control cells were treated with ethanol carrier. Normalized CAT activity of wild type RAR for each treatment group was chosen as 100% relative CAT activity. Nuclear extracts of COS cells transfected as described above with the wild type or the mutant pSG5-RARβ DNA constructs were prepared as previously reported by Jetten et al.(33Jetten A.M. Grippo J.F. Nervi C. MethodsEnzymol. 1990; 189: 248-255Google Scholar). For the RA binding assays, 10-60 μg of total nuclear protein were added in an Eppendorf tube containing various concentrations of [3H]all-trans-RA (DuPont NEN, 47.5 Ci/mmol) ranging from 0.5 to 25 nM for K220Q and from 50 to 330 nM for R269Q and K220Q/R269Q in buffer B (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 M KCl, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin) to the final volume of 200 μl. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 200-fold excess unlabeled all-trans-RA. After 4 h incubation at 4°C, bound [3H]all-trans-RA was separated from free radioactivity by applying the mixture to a PD-10 gel filtration column (Sephadex G-25, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with equilibration buffer (5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.4 M KCl). The column was eluted with equilibration buffer, 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was determined using a Beckman LS 6000BC liquid scintillation counter. For the RAR-β mutants, the specific binding was further corrected for the low endogenous specific binding (endogenous wild type protein in the cells) of the mock-transfected cells. The Kd values were determined by Scatchard plot analysis (34Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1946; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17769) Google Scholar) using Cricket graphics. To determine the Kd for all-trans-retinol, the retinol binding assays were performed exactly the same as described for RA except that 24-36 μg of nuclear protein were incubated in buffer B with various concentrations of [3H]all-trans-retinol (DuPont NEN, 37.3 Ci/mmol) ranging from 3 to 150 nM for K220Q, from 1 to 50 nM for R269Q; and up to 270 nM for wild type, R269A, K220Q/R269Q, and K220A/R269A. Nonspecific binding was determined with a 200-fold excess unlabeled all-trans-retinol. For those mutants in which we could not determine the Kd for all-trans-retinol and/or all-trans-retinal, we calculated the concentration of the retinoid that inhibited 50% of all-trans-RA binding (IC50). In these experiments, 18-36 μg of nuclear protein were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl of buffer B with a saturating concentration of [3H]all-trans-RA (30 nM for wild type, K220A, R269A; 100 nM for K220Q) and various concentrations of unlabeled all-trans-retinol (5-1000 nM) or unlabeled all-trans-retinal (50-1000 nM) for 4 h. Following incubations, the samples were processed as described above for the Kddeterminations. IC50 values were calculated by determining the concentration of all-trans-retinol or all-trans-retinal, which inhibited 50% of all-trans-RA binding from a plot of relative binding versus the log of the all-trans-retinol or all-trans-retinal concentrations. Initially, we wished to examine the effect of mutation of Lys220 and Arg269 of RAR-β singly (K220Q and R269Q) and simultaneously to Gln (K220Q/R269Q) on RA-dependent transactivation activity and RA binding. All three of these mutant RAR-βs contained functional DNA binding and dimerization domains. This was demonstrated in an in vitro electrophoretic mobility assay (data not shown) in which each mutant receptor bound an RARE and dimerized comparable to both wild type RAR-β and our previously described complementary Ala mutant RAR-βs (27Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the results of transactivation assays from cells transfected with each of these DNA constructs and treated with various concentrations of all-trans-RA. K220Q, with an EC50 value of 200 nM, displayed the least reduction (20-fold) in activity compared with that of the wild type receptor. On the other hand, both R269Q and K220Q/R269Q displayed extremely low transactivation activity with an EC50 value greater than 10,000 nM, which is more than 1000-fold higher than that of the wild type receptor (see Table 1). In addition, we also measured the apparent Kd of each of the Gln mutant receptors for all-trans-RA. As can be seen in Fig. 2, A-C (which contain representative RA binding data) and Table 1, the Kd value for all-trans-RA of K220Q was 13 nM (34-fold higher than wild type) while the Kd values for R269Q and K220Q/R269Q were 278 nM and greater than 1000 nM, respectively. Comparison of the EC50 and Kd values of each of the mutant receptors with that of wild type RAR-β demonstrates a similar relationship between the fold reduction in functional activity and all-trans-RA binding.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Retinoid binding properties of selected mutants. A comparison of the binding of all-trans-RA (panels A-C), all-trans-retinol (ROH) (panels D-F), and all-trans-retinal (RAL) (panel G) to wild type (WT), R269Q, and K220Q is shown. Specific [3H]RA and [3H]all-trans-retinol binding data from representative experiments for wild type is shown in panels A and D, for K220Q in panels B and E, and for R269Q in panels C and F. Note that the [3H]RA or [3H]all-trans-retinol concentrations indicated in each panel are different. It should also be noted that the binding data were not corrected for transfection efficiency, resulting in differences in the maximum observed cpms of bound retinoid. Shown in the inset for each panel is the Scatchard plot used to calculate the Kd values. Panel G is a representative competitive inhibition experiment in which wild type and K220Q were saturated with [3H]RA, the specific binding was competed with the indicated concentrations of all-trans-retinal, and the IC50 values were determined. This experiment was not possible for R269Q due to an inability to saturate this mutant with commercially available [3H]RA. Kd and IC50 values are presented in Tables I-III as the mean ± S.E. for at least three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since we have previously observed that K220A/R269A functioned as a RA concentration-dependent dominant negative mutant(27Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wished to next examine the ability of each of the Gln mutants to function as dominant negative factors. These experiments were performed at two different concentrations of all-trans-RA (10-8 and 10-6M) to determine if the dominant negative repression of wild type activity by the mutant receptors could be relieved by increasing the concentration of RA. Fig. 3 shows that each of the Gln mutants were effective dominant negative mutants when transfected with wild type RAR-β. At a concentration of all-trans-RA below the EC50 value for all the mutants (10-8M), only 40, 25, and 15% of the wild type activity was detectable when cells were transfected with K220Q, R269Q, and K220Q/R269Q, respectively. At 10-6M all-trans-RA, the dominant negative effect of each of the mutant constructs was reduced to a level consistent with each of the mutant receptors' transactivation activity and ability to bind all-trans-RA. Thus, each of the Gln mutants (K220Q, R269Q, and K220Q/R269Q), like our previously described RAR-β2 mutants (K220A, R269A, and K220A/R269A), function as ligand-dependent dominant negative factors with their potency inversely proportional to their affinity for all-trans-RA. Examination of the amino acids demonstrated to be required for binding of retinoids and fatty acids to the cellular retinoid-binding proteins and fatty acid-binding proteins reveals that those proteins that bind molecules which contain an alcohol (retinol) or aldehyde (retinal) functional group have two conserved Glns in the binding site, and those that bind ligands with a carboxylate functional group (RA or fatty acids) have two conserved Args at the homologous positions in the binding pocket (for review, see (35Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1993: 283-317Google Scholar)). We therefore wished to determine if our mutant receptors displayed an enhanced affinity for either retinol or retinal compared to the wild type receptor. Fig. 4 shows the results of retinol transactivation assays, and Fig. 2, D-F shows the results of representative retinol binding assays. A comparison of the results of retinol transactivation assays and retinol binding assays is shown in Table 2. In the transactivation assays, cells were transfected with each of the wild type and mutant RAR-β DNA constructs and treated with various concentrations of all-trans-retinol. Retinol binding was measured by determining either the apparent Kd or IC50 values for all-trans-retinol. Wild type RAR-β displayed low all-trans-retinol transactivation activity with an EC50 value of approximately 800-fold greater than that observed with all-trans-RA. Wild type RAR-β also displayed low affinity for all-trans-retinol with no detectable specific binding of [3H]all-trans-retinol up to 270 nM (Fig. 2D) and an IC50 value greater than 1000 nM, comparable to other reports(5Giguere V.

Interestingly, three of the mutant constructs displayed higher transactivation activity and affinity for all-trans-retinol than that of the wild type receptor. R269Q had the highest all-trans-retinol-dependent transactivation activity with an EC50 value 120-fold lower than that of the wild type and the greatest affinity for all-trans-retinol (Kd of 18 nM) (Fig. 2E). K220Q had intermediate activity with an EC50 value 50-fold lower than that of the wild type and a Kd value for all-trans-retinol of 127 nM (Fig. 2F). Finally, K220A was the least active of the three with an EC50 value 10-fold lower than that of the wild type and an IC50 value for all-trans-retinol of 407 nM. The other mutants were found to have activities in the transactivation assay and retinol binding assays equal to or less than that of wild type RAR-β. Interestingly, the two most active mutants (K220Q and R269Q) had relative transactivation activities at the highest all-trans-retinol concentration examined of 200%, 2-fold greater than the maximal activity of the wild type receptor with 10-6M all-trans-RA in this same assay (Fig. 4). There are many possible explanations for this high rate of transactivation activity with retinol compared with that of RA; however, one possibility is that retinol has an increased uptake, stability, or storage (esterification) in the cells compared to that of RA.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2G, Fig. 5, and Table 3 show the results of similar experiments in which we determined the ability of the wild type and mutant RAR-β receptors to transactivate with all-trans-retinal and bind all-trans-retinal. Two of the mutant receptors (K220A and K220Q) displayed higher all-trans-retinal transactivation activity compared with that of the wild type receptor. K220A, with an EC50 of 150 nM, was greater than six times more active than the wild type receptor; K220Q, with an EC50 value of 350 nM, was greater than three times more active than the wild type receptor. In addition, these two mutant receptors have higher affinity (greater than 4-fold) for all-trans-retinal than the wild type receptor (IC50 values are approximately 250 nM for K220A and K22"

We undertook these studies to examine whether the physiological effects of EGF on acid secretion are mediated by regulation of gastric H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, the principle enzyme responsible for acid secretion. EGF in concentrations equivalent to those in plasma increased H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α-subunit mRNA levels. Using H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-luciferase constructs transfected into primary cultured parietal cells, a significant step up in EGF inducibility was observed between bases −162 and −156 (5′-GACATGG-3′) relative to the cap site. This EGF response element (ERE) conferred EGF inducibility when linked to homologous and heterologous promoters. The ERE is homologous to the 3′ half-site of the c-<i>fos</i> serum response element to which rNFIL-6, rE12, and SRE-ZBP bind. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using an ERE probe and parietal cell nuclear extracts revealed a specific DNA-protein complex, the formation of which was changed by neither E12 and NFIL-6 consensus oligonucleotides nor antibodies for NFIL-6, SRE-ZBP, and E12. Our studies indicate that EGF induces gastric H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α-subunit gene expression via an interaction between a specific ERE and a novel transcriptional factor and that this may be a physiologic mechanism by which EGF regulates acid secretion."

We've now shown that pentobarbital does not inhibit in vitro binding of Bm3R1 to the P450BM-3 and P450BM-1 Barbie boxes (BB3 and BB1), although the palindromic operator sequence (OIII) of P450BM-3did have a strong competitive effect on such binding. G39E-Bm3R1, a mutant of Bm3R1, did not bind to either Barbie box. In the presence of Bm3R1, portions of the regulatory regions of P450BM-3 and P450BM-1 were protected from DNase I digestion. These included 11 of the 15 base pairs of BB3 plus 7 base pairs 3′ to BB3, BB1 plus 16 base pairs 3′ to BB1, and, in the 5′-flanking region of P450BM-1, segments covering most of two palindromic sequences (OII and OIII) of 24 and 52 base pairs. These DNase I-protected regions (including OIII) showed considerable sequence identity, especially in a conserved poly(A) motif.

In toto, our results show that Bm3R1 represses both P450BM-1 and P450BM-3expression and that it may effect this by coordinate binding to operator and Barbie box sequences to produce looping of the P450BM-1 and P450BM-3regulatory regions through protein-protein interaction.

Several modification reactions are initiated during entry of the extending polypeptide chain into the ER lumen and may facilitate the folding of the protein into native conformation. These include signal sequence cleavage, attachment of mannose-rich carbohydrate chains, and disulfide bond formation. In addition, a number of ER resident proteins, most notably, protein chaperones, such as BiP/GRP78 and calnexin, and enzymes, such as protein-disulfide isomerase, are thought to be crucial in protein folding, protein-protein interactions in oligomeric structures, and elimination of malfolded polypeptides (32Sanders S.L.

The pathways leading to the promotion of a protein to its final native configuration are still not completely defined. However, a large body of information has proposed that protein folding ensues by rapid interaction of hydrophobic residues in the polypeptide chain, formation of secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets, and finally formation of disulfide bonds or other covalent interactions to stabilize particular regions of the protein (for a review, see 10Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). We are interested in dissecting the molecular mechanisms implicated in the generation of transport-competent and biologically active molecules of human intestinal brush border membrane. Lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), an intestinal brush border glycoprotein responsible for the digestion of lactose in mammalian milk, is one of these molecules. LPH is synthesized in human intestinal cells as a single chain mannose-rich precursor (pro-LPH; Mr = 215,000) that acquires complex glycosylated sugars in the Golgi apparatus prior to proteolytic cleavage and targeting to the brush border membrane as mature LPH (LPHm; Mr = 160,000). The subunit structure of LPHm revealed one single polypeptide under completely denaturing conditions (26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the quaternary structure of LPH has not been analyzed in detail, the presence of dimeric LPH forms has been suggested (6Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) 2H. Y. Naim, unpublished data. The complete amino acid sequence of LPH has been deduced from cDNA cloning and revealed structural features of a type I protein that is synthesized with a cleavable signal sequence and that has a transmembranous orientation (20Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Of note is the presence of a large profragment (LPHα; 868 amino acids) at the N-terminal end that precedes brush border LPHm. Recent identification of LPHα in intestinal biopsy samples (28Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analysis of its possible function have led to the hypothesis that LPHα may play a crucial role in the folding of pro-LPH, perhaps as an intramolecular chaperone (30Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; 28Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LPHα profragment is rich in hydrophobic amino acids and contains 13 cysteine residues, while mature LPH (1061 amino acids) contains, in comparison, only 6 cysteine residues. It is not known whether these cysteine residues are involved in disulfide bond formation. In fact, analysis of pro-LPH as well as cleaved LPHm under reducing and nonreducing conditions did not reveal differences in their electrophoretic mobilities (see “Results”). However, it is possible that slight variations in the apparent molecular weights cannot be detected by SDS-PAGE analysis. In this paper, we investigated the folding of pro-LPH with particular emphasis on disulfide bond formation. SP6 RNA polymerase, nucleotides, nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate, amino acids minus methionine, RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, and dog pancreas microsomal membranes were purchased from Promega. Restriction enzymes, proteinase K, and endoglycosidase H were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. trans-[35S]Methionine was purchased from ICN. The vector pGEM-4Z containing the complete cDNA for human LPH, pLPH (27Naim H.Y. Lacey S. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was linearized with SalI. Transcription was initiated with SP6 RNA polymerase and was carried out essentially as described (12Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the mixture was extracted once with phenol/chloroform and twice with chloroform. After ethanol precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water. Transcribed RNA was translated using a nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The reaction mixture comprised 18 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of 1 mM amino acids (minus methionine), 15 μCi of L-[35S]methionine, and 3 μl of transcribed RNA. Where indicated, the samples were supplemented with 1 μl of nuclease-treated microsomal membranes. Translations were performed in the absence or presence of GSSG at 30°C for 60 min. Human small intestinal mucosas (~5-10 mg, wet weight) were obtained from patients biopsied for diagnostic purposes. They appeared normal when examined by light microscopy and expressed normal levels of brush border disaccharidase activities. Biosynthetic labeling was performed according to 26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar. Briefly, the biopsy specimens were placed on stainless steel grids in organ culture dishes, washed three times in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and incubated in the same medium for 2 h at 37°C in a CO2+ O2 (5:95, v/v) incubator. The biopsy samples were labeled with trans-[35S]methionine at 100 μCi/biopsy sample. After labeling, the specimens were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium and homogenized at 4°C with a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 1 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, supplemented with 50 mM NaCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 17.4 μg/ml benzamidine). Thereafter, the homogenates were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4°C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was treated with 20 mM dithiothreitol at 37°C for 2 h, cooled on ice, and alkylated with 80 mM iodoacetamide for 4 h at 4°C. The reduced and alkylated lysates were then dialyzed in the cold against 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing 50 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Usually, 1 ml of the lysates was dialyzed against 500 ml of dialysis buffer, which was changed four times within 48 h. As a control, labeled biopsy specimens were processed similarly as described above, except that no DTT or iodoacetamide was added. Reduced and alkylated lysates as well as untreated lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH mAb or anti-LPH pAb. Control immunoprecipitations were performed with monoclonal antibody against intestinal sucrase-isomaltase of the brush border membrane. Mouse monoclonal anti-human LPH antibody (anti-LPH mAb) was generously provided by Dr. Hans-Peter Hauri (Biocenter, Basel, Switzerland) (14Hauri H.-P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-LPH antibody (anti-LPH pAb) was prepared by intramuscular injection of electrophoretically purified LPH into rabbits (28Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody was examined by Western blotting using whole brush border membranes as an antigen (see Fig. 4, lane 1). Monoclonal anti-BiP antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Linda Hendershot (St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN) (1Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). To deplete the translation mixtures of ATP for coprecipitation experiments with anti-BiP antibody, the samples were incubated for 2 min at 37°C with apyrase (100 units/ml). Prior to immunoprecipitations, the antibodies were conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads as follows. 1 μl of anti-LPH mAb, 1 μl of anti-BiP antibody, or 5 μl of anti-LPH pAb was mixed with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 1 ml of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 4°C. Thereafter, the beads were washed once with sodium phosphate buffer and used in the immunoprecipitations. The translation mixtures were diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% sodium azide and immunoprecipitated with the corresponding Immunobeads for 6 h at 4°C. To study the ATP dependence of the binding of LPH to BiP, ATP (1 mM) was included in the immunoprecipitation buffer. The pelleted Sepharose beads were washed three times in dilution buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and bromphenol blue). In some experiments, trypsin treatment of immunoprecipitated pro-LPH was performed. Here, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with dilution buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were then resuspended in 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 50 μg of trypsin at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was arrested by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Highly purified brush border membranes were prepared, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-human LPH antibody as described by 26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar. Endoglycosidase H treatment of immunoprecipitates or translation products was performed as described (26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes were isolated as described by 2Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Translocation of the translated proteins was assessed by proteinase K treatment as described previously (2Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by mixing with 5 volumes of SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the presence of 50 mM DTT for reducing conditions and in the presence of 100 mM iodoacetamide for nonreducing conditions and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of 19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar. After electrophoresis, gels were processed for autoradiography and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. To examine the presence of intermolecular or intramolecular disulfide bonds in brush border LPH, brush border membranes were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-LPH antibodies. Fig. 1 demonstrates that under completely denaturing conditions, i.e. in the presence of SDS and DTT, brush border LPH is composed predominantly of one single polypeptide of Mr = 160,000 (lane 2). When DTT was omitted from the electrophoresis sample buffer, the same protein band pattern was obtained (Fig. 1, lane 1). In addition, a high molecular weight band (Mr > 202,000, the molecular weight of the standard protein myosin) was detected. This band has been also previously detected and suggested to correspond to dimeric forms of brush border LPH (34Sterchi E.E. Mills P.R. Fransen J.A.M. Hauri H.-P. Lentze M.J. Naim H.Y. Ginsel L. Bond J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since this band is mainly detected in the nonreduced sample, we conclude that it represents dimers that are covalently associated by intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, the extent of such dimers in total brush border LPH is very low since the Mr = 160,000 polypeptide is the main LPH species detected under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Furthermore, we were not able to detect shifts in the mobilities of the brush border LPH species under reducing and nonreducing conditions. A shift in the mobility would be indicative of the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. It is therefore obvious that the presence of possibly existing disulfide bonds in brush border LPH cannot be assessed by this approach. In view of the results shown above, we sought to investigate the presence of disulfide bonds by utilizing a cell-free transcription/translation system. Here, a full-length LPH cDNA containing the coding sequence for human LPH in the pGEM-4Z vector (denoted pF1; see 27Naim H.Y. Lacey S. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transcribed with phage SP6 RNA polymerase. The resulting RNA was translated in a cell-free translation/translocation system consisting of rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with dog pancreas microsomal vesicles (Fig. 2A). The major polypeptide synthesized in the absence of added microsomal vesicles had an apparent Mr of 200,000 (Fig. 2A, lane 1), consistent with the molecular weight of prepro-LPH calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (20Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the presence of microsomal membranes, an additional polypeptide of Mr = 215,000 was generated (Fig. 2A, lane 2). To assess whether the 215-kDa species was translocated into the interior of the microsomal membranes, two different approaches were carried out. In the first approach, the microsomal membranes were separated from the reticulocyte lysates by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. As shown in Fig. 2B (lane 2), the 215-kDa species was the predominantly labeled polypeptide in the microsomal membranes. Furthermore, the 215-kDa polypeptide was glycosylated, and its glycosylation was of the mannose-rich type since it was converted by endoglycosidase H treatment to a band of 200 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 3), similar to the apparent molecular mass of the nascent polypeptide (lane 1). The recovery of a glycosylated 215-kDa polypeptide in the microsomal membranes indicates that the 200-kDa translation product was exposed to the glycosylation machinery in the interior of the microsomal membranes, leading to the generation of the 215-kDa species. To further assess the translocation of the translated pro-LPH products across the microsomal membranes, the susceptibility of the nascent 200-kDa polypeptide and its glycosylated 215-kDa counterpart to proteinase K was examined. As depicted in Fig. 2C, only the nonglycosylated 200-kDa polypeptide was degraded by this treatment, while glycosylated 215-kDa pro-LPH remained unaffected (lane 2). Treatment of the translated product alone (Fig. 2C, lane 3) with proteinase K resulted also in a degradation of this polypeptide (Fig. 2C, lane 4). On the other hand, solubilization of the microsomal membranes with Triton X-100 followed by proteinase K treatment resulted in a complete degradation of the 215-kDa species (Fig. 2D, lane 3). Therefore, glycosylated 215-kDa pro-LPH was not accessible to proteinase K since it was found in the interior of the microsomal vesicles; solubilization of the membranes led to exposure of this species and consequently to its degradation by proteinase K. Altogether, the data obtained clearly demonstrate that the 200-kDa species is translocated into the microsomal membranes. To investigate the presence of cotranslationally formed disulfide bonds, the translation reaction was carried out in the presence of GSSG. GSSG oxidizes existing thiol groups and therefore facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds. It was required in the reaction mixture to compensate for the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol in the commercially prepared reticulocyte lysates. Varying concentrations of GSSG were added to the reticulocyte lysates before initiation of translation to obtain a lysate that was competent in forming disulfide bonds in the newly synthesized protein. A change in the thiol/disulfide redox status of the translation products has been shown to influence the migration pattern of many proteins (11Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, this could not be assessed electrophoretically for brush border LPHm (Fig. 1), LPH isolated from biopsy samples (see Fig. 4), or LPH synthesized in a cell-free system (data not shown). We therefore sought to determine at the immunochemical level whether GSSG induced conformational alterations in pro-LPH reminiscent of the formation of native disulfide bonds. Here, we used two antibodies directed against LPH: a conformation-specific monoclonal anti-LPH antibody (anti-LPH mAb) (14Hauri H.-P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and a polyclonal antibody directed against the denatured form of LPH (anti-LPH pAb). In the absence of GSSG, immunoprecipitation of the translation products with anti-LPH mAb did not reveal molecular species corresponding to pro-LPH (Fig. 3A, lane 1), although the translation products contained pro-LPH molecules (Fig. 3B, lane 1). In fact, anti-LPH pAb clearly recognized pro-LPH species that were translated in the presence or absence of GSSG (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, in the presence of GSSG, a dose-dependent reactivity of pro-LPH with anti-LPH mAb was manifested. The intensity of pro-LPH (Mr = 215,000) increased when the concentration of GSSG was raised from 1 mM (Fig. 3A, lane 2) to 2 mM (lane 3), but decreased at higher concentrations (up to 4 mM) (lanes 4 and 5). Comparison of the labeling intensities by scanning densitometry of immunoprecipitated pro-LPH (Fig. 3A) and total pro-LPH in the translation products (data not shown) revealed that the decrease in the intensity of immunoprecipitated pro-LPH was due to inhibition of protein synthesis by GSSG and not due to unfolding of pro-LPH. In fact, Fig. 3D demonstrates that the ratio of immunoprecipitated pro-LPH at a certain GSSG concentration versus total synthesized pro-LPH at the same GSSG concentration increased when the concentration of GSSG was raised from 1 to 2 mM, but reached a plateau at higher GSSG concentrations. This result therefore indicates that anti-LPH mAb immunoprecipitates similar proportions of pro-LPH from total pro-LPH synthesized in the presence of 2, 3, and 4 mM GSSG. This strongly suggests that the epitope recognized by the mAb in the pro-LPH molecule does not undergo significant conformational alterations at GSSG concentrations between 2 and 4 mM. On the other hand, it is possible that GSSG may influence the binding of the mAb to the pro-LPH species at increasing concentrations of GSSG, thus leading to reduced amounts of immunoprecipitated pro-LPH at concentrations higher than 2 mM. To investigate this issue, we labeled biopsy samples biosynthetically for 2 h, after which time only the 215-kDa mannose-rich pro-LPH species becomes labeled (26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; 25Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The detergent extracts of the biopsy samples were then treated with various concentrations of GSSG and immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH mAb. As shown in Fig. 3C, essentially similar amounts of labeled pro-LPH were immunoprecipitated at increasing concentrations of GSSG. Therefore, this result demonstrates that GSSG per se does not affect antibody-antigen binding. Consequently, these and the scanning data are consistent with the view that the decrease in the labeling intensity of immunoprecipitated pro-LPH (Fig. 3A) is due to reduced amounts of translated pro-LPH at high GSSG concentrations. Taken together, the reactivity of the conformation-specific antibody with pro-LPH generated in the presence of GSSG, but not in its absence, strongly suggests that the oxidant facilitates the folding of pro-LPH by formation of disulfide bonds, whereby pro-LPH ultimately assumes a conformation similar to that of native intestinal pro-LPH. The observation that anti-LPH mAb (HBB 1/909) binds LPH forms obtained in the presence of GSSG suggests that the epitope recognized by the antibody contains disulfide bonds. To examine this possibility, it was necessary to reduce possibly existing disulfide bonds in LPH and subject the reduced forms to immunoprecipitation with anti-LPH mAb. For this purpose, biopsy samples were biosynthetically labeled for 6 h, after which time the mannose-rich LPH precursor polypeptide, pro-LPH (215 kDa), as well as intracellularly cleaved LPHm (160 kDa) can be detected (26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; 25Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The biopsy lysates were then treated with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, dialyzed to remove any residual reagents, and finally immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH mAb (HBB 1/909) or with anti-LPH pAb. Fig. 4(lane 2) demonstrates that mannose-rich and complex glycosylated precursor pro-LPH as well as LPHm (160 kDa) (26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; 25Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH mAb (HBB 1/909) in the absence of DTT treatment. By contrast, when the biopsy lysates were treated with DTT prior to immunoprecipitation, no bands corresponding to LPH molecules were detected (Fig. 4, lane 3). Similar lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH pAb. This antibody reacts with the denatured 160-kDa LPHm species on Western blots (Fig. 4, lane 1). Under native conditions, anti-LPH pAb recognized only the mannose-rich species (Fig. 4, lane 4). The reactivity of this antibody with LPH forms increased substantially upon reduction of the biopsy lysates. As shown in Fig. 4(lane 5), the intensity of the immunoprecipitated mannose-rich pro-LPH increased by almost a 4-fold factor in comparison with that obtained under native conditions (lane 4). In addition, the 160-kDa LPHm species was also immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH pAb, although to a lesser extent than with anti-LPH mAb under native conditions (Fig. 4, lane 2). Since anti-LPH pAb recognizes the denatured form of LPH and since its binding to the mannose-rich species increases upon reduction of the lysates with DTT, we conclude that the mannose-rich form of pro-LPH recognized by anti-LPH pAb under native conditions corresponds to an unfolded or intermediate folded form of pro-LPH. On the other hand, anti-LPH mAb (HBB 1/909) binds native LPH and fails to precipitate LPH that has been reduced with DTT, strongly suggesting that the epitope recognized by this antibody contains disulfide bonds. It should be mentioned that no change in the electrophoretic mobilities of reduced and alkylated LPH species (Fig. 4, lane 5) relative to the nonreduced species (lane 2) was detected. This is consistent with the notion that an electrophoretic assessment of disulfide bonds in LPH (Fig. 1) is not possible. The immunoprecipitation of LPH forms from reduced lysates with anti-LPH pAb indicated that LPH in these lysates did not undergo substantial degradation owing to the reduction procedure. To corroborate these results and to determine whether other proteins are still intact in the reduced and alkylated lysates, these lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against sucrase-isomaltase (Fig. 4, Mab anti-SI), a major brush border membrane glycoprotein. As shown in Fig. 4, the mannose-rich (SIh) as well as complex glycosylated (SIc) sucrase-isomaltase bands (see 29Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were revealed in both the DTT-treated (lane 7) and untreated (lane 6) samples. Moreover, the labeling intensity of these forms did not change. The data show that the integrity of the solubilized intestinal proteins in the biopsy did not change drastically as a consequence of reduction and alkylation. Moreover, the epitope recognized by the monoclonal sucrase-isomaltase antibody appears not to involve disulfide bonds, in contrast to anti-LPH mAb. In essence, the data indicate that under nondenaturing conditions, anti-LPH mAb recognizes an epitope in native LPH in which disulfide bond(s) are essential. In addition to enzymes involved in protein folding, such as protein-disulfide isomerase, a number of other ER resident proteins, known as molecular chaperones, function in vivo as stabilizers of partially folded intermediates of proteins. We wanted to determine whether partially folded or unfolded intermediates of pro-LPH interact with BiP, a well characterized molecular chaperone (13Haas I.G. Wabl M.R. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). For this purpose, pro-LPH was translated and translocated into the microsomal membranes. The reaction was performed in the presence or absence of GSSG. Furthermore, apyrase was added to the samples to deplete them of ATP since hydrolysis of ATP bound to BiP may result in the release of the associated protein (24Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar; 17Kassenbrock C.K. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; 9Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, immunoprecipitation of the membranes containing the translation products with anti-BiP antibody revealed a glycosylated pro-LPH band when the reaction was performed in the absence of GSSG (lane 1), but not its presence (lane 2). Since GSSG promotes the formation of disulfide bonds and hence facilitates the generation of a native pro-LPH conformation (see Fig. 3), we conclude that only unfolded or partially folded pro-LPH structures bind BiP. We also demonstrated that the complex formed between pro-LPH and BiP can be dissociated in the presence of ATP. Pro-LPH translation products synthesized in the presence or absence of GSSG were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to BiP either in the presence or absence of 1 mM ATP present in the immunoprecipitation buffer. The results shown in Fig. 5 reveal that coimmunoprecipitation of pro-LPH occurs only when GSSG and ATP are absent from the translation reactions (lane 1) and that this complex can be dissociated in the presence of ATP (lane 3). This shows that the association of BiP with pro-LPH is a specific interaction and confirms previous results that demonstrate the ATP-dependent interaction of BiP with malfolded proteins (15Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). To provide further evidence that the conformation of pro-LPH bound to BiP is different from that generated in the presence of 2 mM GSSG, we performed protease sensitivity assays. It is known that native pro-LPH undergoes intracellular cleavage to the brush border membrane LPHm species (7Danielsen E.M. Skovbjerg H. Norn O. Sjstrm H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; 14Hauri H.-P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar; 26Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; 25Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the site of cleavage has been proposed to lie between Arg868 and Ala869 (20Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar; 22Montgomery R.K. Bller H.A. Rings E.H.H.M. Grand R.J. FASEB J. 1991; 13: 2824-2832Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and therefore represents a potential trypsin cleavage site. In fact, treatment of recombinant pro-LPH expressed in COS-1 cells with trypsin generates a brush border-like species (27Naim H.Y. Lacey S. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that a correctly folded pro-LPH molecule should be cleaved by trypsin to the mannose-rich analogue of LPHm, while malfolded pro-LPH should reveal a different behavior toward trypsin. For this purpose, pro-LPH species that bind or do not bind BiP were translated in the absence or presence of GSSG, respectively, immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH pAb or anti-LPH mAb, and finally treated with trypsin. As expected, anti-LPH pAb precipitated the nascent 200-kDa polypeptide as well as the glycosylated 215-kDa species (Fig. 6, lane 1). On the other hand, anti-LPH mAb reacted exclusively with the glycosylated species generated in the presence of GSSG (lane 3). Trypsin treatment of pro-LPH translated in the absence of GSSG and immunoprecipitated with the pAb resulted in a complete degradation of this species (Fig. 6, lane 2). By contrast, pro-LPH immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH mAb was cleaved into two polypeptides in the presence of trypsin, a 135-kDa species and an ~80-90-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 6, lane 4). The variations in the reactivity with trypsin corroborate the findings that GSSG assists the formation of a native conformation of pro-LPH, while in its absence, a malfolded species that binds to BiP is generated. In this paper, we analyzed the folding state of pro-LPH in a cell-free transcription/translation system with particular emphasis on the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. The pro-LPH molecule contains 19 cysteine residues, 13 of which are found in a large domain at the N-terminal end (~45% of total pro-LPH) that is cleaved off during maturation of pro-LPH to LPHm (20Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Ample evidence has accumulated to suggest that the native conformation of proteins is promoted by the formation of disulfide bonds that stabilize particular structures within the protein (4Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5Creighton T.E. BioEssays. 1988; 8: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to determine whether disulfide bond formation is an essential event in the folding process of pro-LPH. While for many proteins the presence of disulfide bonds could be manifested by shifts in the protein mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (11Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), this approach may not be adequately sensitive when large proteins such as pro-LPH or LPHm are studied. In fact, the initial analysis of the subunit structure of pro-LPH and LPHm by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions did not provide any evidence of the presence of intramolecular disulfide bridges since no major electrophoretic alterations of reduced versus nonreduced components could be discerned. This is even more difficult to detect, if at all, if only a few cysteine residues are implicated in disulfide bond formation. We therefore investigated a possible role of disulfide bond formation in the folding of pro-LPH using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with microsomal membranes derived from dog pancreas. One of the advantages of this system is that disulfide bond formation can be promoted and controlled by the addition of the thiol oxidant GSSG. The promotion of a native conformation in which disulfide bonds are implicated can then be monitored by the binding capacity of pro-LPH to a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody. However, this requires that the epitope recognized by this monoclonal antibody contains disulfide bonds. In intestinal biopsy samples, LPH is synthesized as a mannose-rich polypeptide (pro-LPH) that undergoes intracellular cleavage to LPHm. Our data demonstrate that anti-LPH mAb (HBB1/909) recognizes the pro-LPH and LPHm species under conditions that do not disrupt the native conformation of LPH forms. When the native conformation of pro-LPH and LPHm is altered upon reduction of the biopsy lysates with DTT, anti-LPH mAb fails to bind pro-LPH and LPHm. By contrast, a control polyclonal antibody, which binds denatured forms of LPH on Western blots, immunoprecipitates the LPHm species only after the biopsy lysates have been reduced with DTT. Moreover, the binding capacity of this antibody to pro-LPH increases substantially upon DTT reduction, most likely due to unfolding of pro-LPH. These findings indicate that anti-LPH mAb (HBB 1/909) specifically binds regions in pro-LPH that implicate disulfide bonds in their secondary structure, while the polyclonal antibody binds the unfolded or intermediate forms of LPH. This underscores, on the other hand, the important role played by disulfide bonds in the generation of a native conformation of LPH. The translated nascent polypeptide chain of pro-LPH as well as its glycosylated form obtained in the presence of microsomal membranes reveal similar apparent molecular weights compared with their counterparts in intestinal cells. In the absence of GSSG, these polypeptides reacted with a polyclonal anti-LPH antibody, but not with a monoclonal anti-LPH antibody, indicating that under these conditions, pro-LPH has not yet assumed its native conformation. This is further corroborated by the following two observations. (i) Pro-LPH binds the molecular chaperone BiP, which is known to stabilize unfolded or partially folded protein molecules (3Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in an ATP-dependent manner; and (ii) pro-LPH generated in the absence of GSSG undergoes complete degradation upon trypsin treatment, while pro-LPH obtained in the presence of GSSG is cleaved to two distinct polypeptides, one of which most likely corresponds to the mannose-rich counterpart of LPHm. Upon addition of GSSG to microsomal membranes, a dose-dependent reactivity of pro-LPH with the conformation-specific monoclonal anti-LPH antibody can be manifested. In view of the binding specificity of anti-LPH mAb, this result is indicative of a native conformation of pro-LPH being facilitated by the formation of disulfide bonds. The failure of pro-LPH to bind BiP strongly favors the notion that pro-LPH has assumed a native conformation under these conditions. The profile of monoclonal anti-LPH antibody binding to pro-LPH at varying concentrations of GSSG parallels most likely the formation of disulfide bonds. This reaction appears to reach equilibrium at a GSSG concentration of 2 mM, at which the binding of pro-LPH to the monoclonal antibody is maximal. At lower GSSG concentrations, the intensity of pro-LPH immunoprecipitated with anti-LPH mAb is markedly reduced. This could be explained by the presence of folding intermediates of pro-LPH that do not efficiently bind the conformation-specific antibody. Alternatively, concentrations lower than 2 mM GSSG promote the formation of disulfide bonds of only a proportion of existing pro-LPH molecules, which ultimately bind to the monoclonal antibody. Since a protein can refold in vitro without the presence of other protein components, it is anticipated that secondary and tertiary structures other than disulfide bridges form in pro-LPH regardless of the absence or presence of GSSG. These structures, however, do not endow pro-LPH per se with a native configuration since pro-LPH does not bind the conformation-specific antibody in the absence of GSSG. At concentrations higher than the optimum, GSSG inhibits protein synthesis as shown previously (33Scheele G. Jacoby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12277-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 21Marquardt T. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it remains to be determined whether disulfide bond formation has directly affected the folding state of pro-LPH by stabilizing folding intermediates of the molecule or has secondary effects, for example by influencing the glycosylation state, which in turn alters the configuration of pro-LPH. In fact, evidence has been obtained to show that disulfide bond formation and the glycosylation state of several proteins are closely linked events (3Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)."

To understand the mechanism of α4β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion, we made mutant α4 constructs. Three aspartic acid (Asp) residues in α4, Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811, were replaced with glutamic acids (Glu). The wild-type and mutant α4 constructs were transfected into K562 cells, and stable transfectants with similar levels of α4 surface expression were established. The Asp → Glu substitutions did not affect α4β1 association or heterodimer formation as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analysis. However, the glutamate substitutions at Asp-489 and Asp-698 severely impaired cell adhesion to VCAM and fibronectin, whereas the substitution at Asp-811 had no detectable effect on cell adhesion. In contrast to these results, isolated α4β1, containing the D489E or D698E substitution, was able to bind to VCAM, suggesting that these two residues are not critical for ligand recognition. In searching for a mechanism to explain inhibition of adhesion by Asp-489 and Asp-698 mutations, we found that the sequences flanking Asp-698 resemble the DxxxxxD-S-Sx divalent cation/ligand binding motif in β integrins and the I-domains of α integrins. This suggests that Asp-698 in the α4 integrin, which does not possess an I-domain, may also be involved in cation binding and may be part of a sequence functionally similar to that found in the I-domains of other α integrins.

Integrins are structurally related cell surface receptors involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. They are noncovalently associated heterodimers of α and β subunits (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Many different α subunits are able to associate with the same β subunit to form α/β dimers with distinct ligand specificity. The ligand specificity of integrins are, therefore, believed to be determined largely by the structures of the α subunits. The α4β1 integrin (VLA-4, CD49d/CD29) is expressed on lymphocytes, monocytes, bone marrow progenitors, and on some tumor cell lines(2Hemler M.E. Huang C. Schwarz L. J. Biol.

Masumoto and Hemler (13Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of these divalent cation binding sites for α4 function. Mutations at each of the three divalent cation binding sites (N283E, D346E, and D408E) of α4 resulted in significant loss in the ability of α4 to bind VCAM and fibronectin, whereas mutations at Cys-278, Cys-717, Cys-767, and Cys-828, downstream from the cation binding sites, did not affect interaction of α4 with VCAM (13Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A novel bivalent cation binding site has been identified in the integrin β subunits(14Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. J.

A similar cation binding motif is also found in the I-domain containing α subunits(15Loftus J. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Mutation at the aspartic acid residue in this cation binding site abolishes cell-ligand adhesion and cation binding(15Loftus J. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Therefore, in addition to the essential role of the classical integrin cation binding sites in cell adhesion, β subunits and the I-domains in α subunits also appear to be critically involved in the interaction of integrins with cations and ligands. In an attempt to identify the ligand binding site in α4, we made synthetic peptides derived from α4 and examined their abilities to inhibit cell adhesion to VCAM. Our preliminary experiments showed that α4 peptides, containing residues 482-491, 691-700, and 804-813, specifically inhibited the interaction of α4β1 with recombinant VCAM (20Webb D.L. Marlor C.W. Conrad P.J. Barkowski-Clark S. Blue M.-L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and the aspartic acid in these peptides appeared to be critical for inhibition. ( 2M.-L. Blue and P. J. Conrad, unpublished observation. )In this study, we have replaced the three aspartic acid residues, Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811, with glutamic acid and examined the function of the mutated α4 integrins in cell adhesion. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Klenow fragments were purchased from New England Biolabs, and the Sequenase 2.0 Sequencing Kit was obtained from United States Biochemical Corp. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin-Elmer Cetus. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma, and the 40-kDa fragments of human fibronectin (FN-40) were from Life Technologies, Inc. PBS (Bio-Whittaker) contains 10 mM phosphate (pH 7.0), 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2. Antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-human α4 monoclonal antibodies C212.7(21Blue M.-L. Davis G. Conrad P. Kelley K. Immunology. 1993; 78: 80-85PubMed Google Scholar), HP2/1 (Amac, Inc., (4Sanchez-Mardrid F. De Landazuri M.O. Morago G. Cebrian M. Acevedo A. Bernabeu C. Eur. J.

Bernard A. Tran H.C. Leca G. Kanellopoulos J.M. Boumsell L. Scand. J. Immunol. 1986; 23: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)), and goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein conjugate (Tago). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension in the polymerase chain reaction using pBWT, a pBluescript SK plasmid containing human α4-cDNA inserted at XhoI/XbaI sites as a template as described (23Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The third base of the aspartic acid (Asp) codon for Asp-489, Asp-698, Asp-811, or Asp-698 and Asp-811 in α4, was mutated from T to A using mutant oligonucleotide primers to generate the codon for glutamic acid (Glu). The mutant α4 cDNA carrying the Asp → Glu substitutions were cloned into pBluescript and sequenced to confirm the presence of the intended mutation and absence of any Taq polymerase errors. The four mutant α4-cDNAs were constructed in pBluescript by exchanging the restriction fragment containing the mutation for the corresponding wild-type sequence. The wild-type and mutant α4 cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and designated as pcWT (wild-type), pcD489E, pcD698E, pcD811E (carrying Asp → Glu substitution at Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811, respectively), and pcLEV (carrying Asp → Glu triple substitutions at Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811). K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 20 μg of linearized α4 pcDNA3 constructs by electroporation at 270 V/0.4 cm and 960 microfarads in 0.4 ml of PBS using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). After 48 h, transfected cells were placed in medium containing 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Geneticin-resistant cells were subjected to several rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using mAb C212.7 and a FACStar Plus cytometer (Becton Dickinson) to enrich and to clone α4 expressing stable transfectants. Cells were incubated with primary mouse mAb in PBS containing 10% human serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) on ice for 20 min. After washing three times in PBS, the cells were treated with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein (Tago) in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in the same buffer, and analyzed using a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Cells were washed with cold PBS, and samples were adjusted to equal cell numbers and cell densities of 107/ml. Cells were then incubated with PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) and 14 mM glucose at room temperature. After 30 min, glycine was added to a final concentration of 4 mM, and the cell suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then lysed on ice in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation followed by incubation with GammaBind G Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech) and recentrifugation. Aliquots of the lysates were incubated with specific integrin antibodies overnight at 4°C, subsequently absorbed onto GammaBind G Sepharose, followed by washing in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% Tween 20. Absorbed complexes were removed from the beads by heating in reduced SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 65°C for 30 min, and the supernatants were analyzed on 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex). Proteins resolved on gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and the membranes were first incubated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Boehringer Mannheim) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Biotinylated proteins were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.) according to manufacturer-suggested protocol. Assays for cell adherence to ligand proteins were carried out essentially as described(20Webb D.L. Marlor C.W. Conrad P.J. Barkowski-Clark S. Blue M.-L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled by incubating with 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate and were added, with or without PMA or antibodies, to 96-well microtiter plates coated with recombinant VCAM, consisting of domains 1 to 3 of VCAM (VCAM1-3)(20), or coated with FN-40. Nonspecific sites on the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. After a 25-min incubation at room temperature, unbound cells were removed by washing and low speed centrifugation with the plates inverted. Cells remaining bound to the plates were quantitated using a Cyto Fluor 2300 fluorimeter (Millipore). Nonspecific background cell binding was below 2% under these conditions. Two approaches were used to assess the ability of α4 integrin to bind to VCAM. In assay A, purified recombinant human VCAM1-3 was coupled to Sepharose 4B. 5 × 106 cells were surface-labeled with biotin and lysed in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, and 50 mM β-octyl glucoside (Buffer A). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with Sepharose 4B in Buffer A containing 5 mg/ml myoglobin. After centrifugation, the supernatants were then incubated with VCAM-Sepharose at 4°C for 3 h. The VCAM-Sepharose was washed four times in Buffer A. One-half of the VCAM-Sepharose was incubated in Buffer A containing 20 mM EDTA overnight, and eluted α4 was immunoprecipitated with mAb CIII376.2 and GammaBind G Sepharose. The biotinylated proteins bound to Sepharose were analyzed on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels and detected with streptavidin peroxidase conjugate, using ECL following Western blotting. In assay B, CIII376.2, a mAb against the C-terminal peptide of α4, was coupled to Sepharose. 1 × 107 cells were lysed in Buffer A or 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 50 mM β-octyl glucoside (Buffer B). After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were first precleared with Sepharose 4B and then were incubated with CIII376.2-Sepharose or Sepharose (control) overnight at 4°C. After washing, aliquots of the Sepharose were incubated with various concentrations of biotinylated VCAM1-3 in Buffer A or Buffer B containing 5 mg/ml myoglobin at 4°C for 2 h. The Sepharose was recovered by centrifugation and washed in the same buffer. Biotinylated VCAM bound to the Sepharose was analyzed as described above. An aliquot of the cells (1 × 106) was surface-labeled with biotin, and the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with mAb CIII376.2 as a control for α4 surface expression. Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811 of α4 (Fig. 1) were substituted with glutamic acid by site-directed mutagenesis. Stably transfected cell lines expressing wild-type α4 (K-WT) and α4 containing glutamic acid substitutions at the three aspartic acid residues Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811 (K-LEV) were established in K562. Five clones from each transfectant were selected, and the clones showed comparable levels of α4 surface expression by immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). Clones K-WT.1 and K-LEV.5 were characterized in the present study. Surface expression of α4β1 integrin was analyzed by flow cytometry using mAb C212.7. As shown in Fig. 2A, α4 surface expression on cell line K562 was not detectable. Both K-WT and K-LEV showed similar levels of α4 surface expression (Fig. 2, E and I). The data suggest that the mutations at the three aspartic acid residues did not have a significant effect on the biosynthesis and surface expression of α4. As shown in Fig. 2D, K562 expresses abundant β1 subunits. When transfected with pcWT, the surface expression of β1 increased significantly (Fig. 2H). The pcLEV transfectant also exhibited elevated β1 expression (Fig. 2L). To examine whether the Asp → Glu triple substitutions cause significant changes in α4 secondary structure, the mutant α4 transfectant was analyzed using different α4 mAbs for immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2I, the epitope for α4 mAb C212.7 was retained on α4LEV, indicating that the mutations do not disrupt the structure of this epitope. Two other α4 mAbs recognizing different epitopes on α4, HP2/1 and B-5G10, were also tested. Both antibodies recognized α4LEV (Fig. 2, J and K). It has been shown that mAb C212.7 and HP2/1 block α4 binding to VCAM and fibronectin2(17Komoriya A. Green L.J. Mervic M. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15075-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcia-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Biol.

Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). The epitopes that mAb HP2/1 and B-5G10 recognize belong to previously defined B1 and C epitope groups of α4, respectively(24Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcia-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FACS analysis (Fig. 2) suggests that the mutations at Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811 do not affect the structures of these epitopes, and, therefore, the mutations probably do not cause any significant change in the global secondary structure of α4. Surface expression of α4 on K-WT or K-LEV transfectants was also analyzed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). Both the α4WT and α4LEV proteins show identical patterns: they are present on the cell surface in a cleaved form (80 kDa and 70 kDa) and are associated with the endogenous β1 subunits (120 kDa). The results indicate that the Asp → Glu substitutions do not affect the in vivo cleavage of α4, α4β1 heterodimer formation, or the stability of the complex. Adhesion of K-WT and K-LEV to immobilized recombinant human VCAM1-3 was compared. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, K-WT bound to VCAM strongly, whereas K-LEV was much less adherent to the same ligand. At ligand coating concentrations of 2.5 to 5 μg/ml, adhesion by K-LEV was approximately 4-6-fold lower than adhesion by K-WT. Similar results were obtained with adhesion to murine L-cell transfectants expressing the 7-domain form of human VCAM (data not shown)(20Webb D.L. Marlor C.W. Conrad P.J. Barkowski-Clark S. Blue M.-L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The control cell line K562, showed little, if any, binding to recombinant VCAM, indicating that the adhesion was dependent on transfection of α4. As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, the adhesion of K-WT or K-LEV transfectants to VCAM could be blocked completely by mAb C212.7, which is directed against the α4 subunit of VLA-4. The adhesion could also be blocked by an antibody against human VCAM (data not shown). This indicates that the adhesion of α4 transfectants to immobilized VCAM is an α4- and VCAM-dependent specific interaction. The avidity of integrins can be regulated through inside-out cell signaling. The avidity of VLA-4 increases upon activation with phorbol esters(26Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 27Wilkins J.A. Stupack D. Steward S. Shen C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both K-LEV and K-WT could respond to PMA stimulation (Fig. 5A). However, PMA failed to fully restore the capability of K-LEV to bind VCAM. In addition, the α4 antibody C212.7 triggered homotypic cell aggregation of K-LEV (data not shown), suggesting that the mutant VLA-4 integrin is also functional in outside-in cell signaling. The ability of K-LEV to adhere to fibronectin was also tested. FN-40 is a chymotryptic fragment of human fibronectin(28Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Rouslahti E. Cell. 1981; 26: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It contains the sequence essential for α4β1 recognition (29Wayner E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humphries M. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion of K-WT to FN-40 required PMA stimulation. K-LEV failed to adhere to FN-40 under these conditions (Fig. 5B). Mutations at all three aspartic acid residues of the α4 subunit resulted in decreased cell adhesion to fibronectin and VCAM. To determine the contribution of each substitution, mutant α4 constructs, pcD489E, pcD698E, and pcD811E, each of which contains a glutamic acid substitution at only one of the aspartic acid residues, were transfected into K562. The pcWT construct was used as a control. Stable clonal transfectants (K-WT, K-D489E, K-D698E, K-D811E) with similar α4 surface expression were obtained following repeated rounds of cell sorting. K562, K-WT, K-D489E, K-D698E, and K-D811E were analyzed for α4 surface expression (Fig. 6). As expected, the mutant and wild-type transfectants expressed α4 at comparable levels, and the α4 antibodies C212.7, HP2/1, and B-5G10 recognized all three mutant α4 subunits (Fig. 6). The mutant α4 transfectants K-D489E, K-D698E, and K-D811E were compared with K-WT in adhesion assays for their abilities to bind VCAM and fibronectin. Transfectant/VCAM adhesion is shown in Fig. 7A. The percentage of K-D811E cells adhering to VCAM is similar to that of K-WT. However, the binding of K-D489E and K-D698E transfectants to VCAM was significantly lower than that of K-WT. Their adhesion to VCAM (at 3.5 μg/ml) was only 10-20% of that of K-WT. Even at a higher concentration of VCAM (7 μg/ml), K-D489E and K-D698E adhered poorly. These results suggest that aspartate 811 in α4 is not essential for VCAM binding. In contrast, Asp-698 and Asp-489 are required for VLA-4-mediated cell adhesion. It is believed that the ligand binding sites on α4 for VCAM and fibronectin are identical or overlapping(24Pulido R. Elices M.J. Campanero M.R. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Garcia-Pardo A. Lobb R. Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10241-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4005-4011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the Asp → Glu substitutions on fibronectin binding, the abilities of K-D489E, K-D698E, and K-D811E to adhere to FN-40 were tested. As shown in Fig. 7B, K-WT adhered to FN-40 upon PMA activation. Adhesion of K-D811E was comparable to that of K-WT. However, K-D489E and K-D698E failed to adhere to FN-40 under the same conditions. The direct binding of ligand to wild-type and mutant α4 isolated from K-WT, K-LEV, K-D489E, and K-D698E was assessed using either surface-labeled cell extracts and VCAM-Sepharose or biotinylated VCAM1-3 and affinity-purified α4β1 (Fig. 8). As indicated in Fig. 8A, α4β1 complexes from both K-WT and K-LEV cells bound to VCAM-Sepharose in a cation-dependent manner. The amount of mutant α4 bound to VCAM-Sepharose was comparable to that of wild-type. In other experiments, wild-type or mutant α4β1 was immobilized on CIII376.2-Sepharose and incubated with various concentrations of biotinylated VCAM1-3. At a VCAM concentration of 0.06 μg/ml, VCAM binding to either wild-type or mutant α4β1 was not detectable (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8B, at VCAM concentrations of 0.3 and above, the mutant α4β1 from K-LEV, K-D489E, and K-D698E was able to bind VCAM even at low concentrations of cations, and the amounts of VCAM bound to the mutant forms of α4β1 were similar to that bound to the α4β1 from K-WT. These results suggest that substitutions at Asp-489 and Asp-698 are not critical for VCAM recognition. To understand the mechanism of inhibition of cell adhesion mediated by α4 with D489E and D698E substitutions, we compared the flanking sequences at these sites with corresponding sequences in other α integrins. Comparison of the Asp-489 flanking sequences with corresponding sequences in other α chains showed that this aspartic acid is conserved among most integrin α chains. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this residue plays an important role in discriminating between different ligands. It may be involved in a common integrin structure required for cell adhesion. Analysis of the Asp-698 flanking sequences showed that the DISFLLD698VSSLS sequence resembles the DxxxxxD-S-Sx cation binding motif found in β subunits and the I-domain of other α integrins (Fig. 9). We have demonstrated that glutamic acid substitutions at Asp-489 and Asp-698 severely impair the ability of α4-transfected cells to adhere to VCAM and fibronectin. A third mutation at Asp-811 had no detectable effect on cell adhesion to VCAM or fibronectin. However, direct binding experiments with isolated α4 and VCAM suggest that Asp-489 and Asp-698 are not critical for ligand recognition. We found that the Asp-698 residue in α4 resides in a sequence resembling the cation/ligand binding DxxxxD-S-Sx motif found in β integrins and the I-domain of α integrins, implicating Asp-698 in cation-ligand interactions. Therefore, Asp-489 and Asp-698 may regulate cell adhesion through a novel and/or cation-dependent mechanism. To investigate the effect of D489E and D698E substitutions on gross conformation of α4, transfected cells with mutated α4s were analyzed for disruption of anti-α4 epitopes, loss of α4/β1 chain association or α4 cleavage, and impairment of signal transduction. As shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, α4LEV, α4D489E, α4D698E, and α4D811E were all recognized by a panel of mAbs against various distinct epitopes of α4. The glutamic acid substitutions at Asp-489, Asp-698, and Asp-811 of α4 also did not affect the ability of α4 to associate with the β1 subunit or the in vivo cleavage of α4 (Fig. 3). Therefore, the decreased cell adhesion by K-D489E and K-D698E is unlikely to be caused by disruption of α4 secondary structure. The mutant α4 molecules also maintained the flexibility required for undergoing certain conformational changes during signaling. Integrins mediate outside-in and inside-out cell signaling. VLA-4-mediated cell adhesion can be rapidly and dramatically augmented by phorbol esters(26Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). PMA activation (inside-out signaling) does not change the level of VLA-4 expression, and it is not dependent on de novo protein synthesis(26Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 27Wilkins J.A. Stupack D. Steward S. Shen C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have shown that the adhesion of mutant α4 transfectants to ligand increases in response to PMA treatment (Fig. 5A). A number of anti-α4 antibodies, when binding to α4β1 integrin on the cell surface, cause homotypic cell adhesion (outside-in signaling, (31Campanero M.R. Pulido R. Ursa M.A. Rodriguez-Moya M. de Landazuri M.O. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). Anti-α4 antibody also triggered homotypic aggregation of the mutant α4 transfectants (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the view that the Asp → Glu substitutions did not change the global secondary structure of α4. The ability of K-LEV, K-D489E, and K-D698E to adhere to VCAM or fibronectin was severely impaired as demonstrated in Fig. 4, 5, and 7. To determine whether impaired adhesion was due to the inability of mutant α4 to recognize ligand, direct ligand binding studies with α4 isolated from K-LEV, K-D489E, and K-D698E and purified VCAM were carried out (Fig. 8). The ability of α4 Asp-489 or α4 Asp-698 to bind VCAM argues that Asp-489 and Asp-698 are not critical for ligand recognition. Therefore, the D489E and D698E substitutions may affect adhesion and the function of the α4β1 integrin in vivo by another mechanism. Both Asp-489 and Asp-698 are in an α-helix/turn/β-sheet structure, whereas Asp-811 is in the middle of a β-sheet according to the Chou-Fasman prediction(32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev.

The turn regions where Asp-489 and Asp-698 reside have fairly high surface probability and flexibility, whereas Asp-811 has low surface probability. This suggests that Asp-489 and Asp-698 may be exposed on α4 and have the ability to interact with other proteins. One mechanism of impairing integrin function is disruption of divalent cation binding sites. Divalent cations are required for integrins to bind to their ligands(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 35Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Conner K. Larson R.S. Springer T.A.

Masumoto and Hemler (13Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of the three putative divalent cation binding sites for α4 function. Mutations at each of the three divalent cation binding sites resulted in significant inhibition of α4-mediated cell adhesion to VCAM and fibronectin. It has been reported recently that certain aspartic acid residues in the I-domains of αM and α2 are required for cell adhesion(18Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In both cases, the essential aspartic acid residue resides in the DxxxxxD-S-Sx sequence (Fig. 9) as proposed by Bajt and Loftus(14Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20913-20919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Michishita et al. (19Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that the same aspartic acid residue in αM is required for cation binding. In β1 and β3 subunits, the aspartic acid residues in this motif have also been proven to be critical for ligand binding(37Huang X.-Z. Chen A. Agrez M. Sheppard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 4: 283aGoogle Scholar, 38Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A point mutation in the β3 subunit of the αIIbβ3 integrin has been identified in the Cam variant of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia(33Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The substitution of the aspartic acid residue within this motif in β3 to tyrosine resulted in a perturbed interaction with divalent cations and the inability of αIIbβ3 to recognize ligand. We have compared the Asp-698 flanking sequence with those of relevant sequences from different α and β subunits (Fig. 9). The sequence around Asp-698 of α4 resembles the divalent cation binding motif mentioned above and thus implicates Asp-698 in divalent cation binding. Our finding that Asp-698 is critical for the interaction of α4-transfected cells with VCAM and fibronectin supports this hypothesis. Therefore, Asp-698 may be part of a novel cation binding motif in α4, which is required for α4 function. In summary, we have identified two aspartates, Asp-489 and Asp-698, in α4, critical for α4β1-mediated cell adhesion. We found that the sequences flanking Asp-698 resemble the cation binding motif DxxxxxD-S-Sx, recently identified in the ligand binding domain (I-domain) of α integrins. Since α4 does not contain an I-domain, this raises the possibility that the region of α4 containing the DxxxxxD-S-Sx motif is functionally similar to that of the I-domain. The DxxxxxD-S-Sx motif in the I-domain of α integrins appears not to be required for ligand recognition as has been shown in studies with α2(34Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and αM(39Ueda T. Rieu P. Brayer J. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10680-10684Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our present findings are consistent with these results. Asp-689 may affect cell adhesion by increasing ligand accessibility or maintaining a binding pocket with high ligand affinity through binding of divalent cation. Alternatively, given that cell adhesion is a complex process, one or both aspartate residues (Asp-489, Asp-698) may be critical for efficient cell adhesion through an interaction with an as yet unknown cofactor. We would like to thank Maura Macaro for flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting."
https://openalex.org/W1582715319,"Abstract Neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors consist of three subtypes, designated NPY1, NPY2, and NPY3. The Y1 receptor has been cloned. The present study reports the purification of the NPY-Y2 receptor from porcine brain and its biochemical characterization. NPY receptors were solubilized and purified by sequential hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange, and NPY-affinity chromatography. By use of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography gel permeation chromatography, and chemical cross-linking studies, the affinity-purified brain NPY-Y2 receptor was identified as a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 60 kDa. Following deglycosylation, the molecular mass of the Y2 receptor was decreased to 45 kDa. Although the 125I-NPY binding to the purified NPY receptor was considerably decreased by N-ethylmaleimide, guanine nucleotides had no effect. Therefore, the purified NPY-Y2 receptor is probably not associated with G-proteins, but may have intramolecular-free sulfhydryl groups. The specific activity of the isolated NPY-Y2 receptor is 15.8 nmol/mg of protein. The isolated receptor retained its capacity to bind to 125I-NPY, specific to NPY and peptide YY, and showed no cross-reactivity with any other peptides. Highly purified (109-fold purification) NPY receptor from the brain was identified as the Y2 subtype as demonstrated by its affinity to C-terminal fragments of NPY, including NPY-(13-36)."
https://openalex.org/W1992017937,"Polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides are initially synthesized as precursors possessing one or several domains that constitute the propeptide. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that expression of anglerfish prosomatostatin-I (proSRIF-I) in rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells resulted in efficient and accurate cleavage of the prohormone to generate the mature 14-amino acid peptide, SRIF-I. We also implicated the propeptide in mediating intracellular sorting to the trans Golgi network where proteolytic processing is initiated. In contrast, expression of a second form of the precursor, proSRIF-II in GH3 cells resulted in its intracellular degradation in an acidic, post-trans Golgi network compartment, most probably lysosomes. To further investigate the positive sorting signal present in proSRIF-I, we constructed a chimera comprising the signal peptide and proregion of SRIF-I fused to proSRIF-II and expressed the cDNA in GH3 cells. Here we demonstrate that the propeptide of SRIF-I rescued proSRIF-II from intracellular degradation quantitatively and diverted it to secretory vesicles. Furthermore, the chimera was processed to SRIF-28, an amino-terminally extended form of the hormone that is the physiological cleavage product of proSRIF-II processing in vivo. Most significantly, the SRIF-I propeptide functioned only in cis as part of the fusion protein and not in trans when expressed as a separate polypeptide. These data suggest that the SRIF-I propeptide may possess a sorting signal for sequestration into the secretory pathway rather than functioning as an intramolecular chaperone to promote protein folding.

Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are synthesized as polypeptide precursors or prohormones that undergo a series of post-translational processing reactions during their transport through the secretory pathway to generate the mature hormone. A common feature of prohormones is that the bioactive peptide is usually flanked by pairs of basic amino acids or less commonly, single basic residues. Endoproteolytic cleavage at a defined set of basic residues, mediated by prohormone convertase enzymes (31Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 26Seidah N.G. Chrtien M. Trends Endocrinol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), results in excision of the peptide, which may then be subject to further covalent modifications. For several prohormones, proteolytic processing is initiated in the trans Golgi network and continues during targeting to and within nascent immature secretory granules (19Mains R.E. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7887-7894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 11Fisher J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

The mature hormones are then concentrated, resulting in the formation of dense core secretory granules that fuse with the plasma membrane and discharge their contents in response to external stimuli; this has been designated “regulated secretion” (4Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). For most prohormones, removal of the propeptide occurs quite late in the secretory pathway. Consequently, it is possible that propeptides may function both in the proximal steps of secretion by promoting correct prohormone folding, exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, and/or transport through the Golgi cisternae and in more distal events by targeting precursors to post-Golgi secretory vesicles. Indeed, several laboratories including our own (33Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar; 28Sevarino K.A. Stork P. Ventimiglia R. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Cell. 1989; 57: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the propeptides of some hormone precursors mediate intracellular transport and processing. Expression in pituitary GH3 cells of a chimera consisting of the signal sequence and propeptide of anglerfish preproSRIF-I fused to ape α-globin resulted in targeting of α-globin to the regulated secretory pathway; furthermore, the chimera was correctly processed to yield α-globin (33Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Analogous results were obtained by 28Sevarino K.A. Stork P. Ventimiglia R. Mandel G. Goodman R.H.

Similarly, the amino-terminal domain of proenkephalin targeted frog dermophin to the regulated secretory pathway (25Seethaler G. Chaminade M. Vlasak R. Ericsson M. Griffiths G. Toffoletto O.

Deletion of the propeptide from rat serum albumin, a protein secreted via the constitutive pathway, inhibited its exit rate from the endoplasmic reticulum, implying that the propeptide might be involved in protein folding in this organelle (21McCracken A.A. Kruse K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20843-20846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Mutagenesis and gene fusion studies have shown that the propeptide of a yeast vacuolar hydrolase precursor, pro-proteinase A, contains a vacuolar targeting signal and that this sequence is important for facilitating proper folding of the enzyme and efficient transit through the secretory pathway (16Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Studies on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar enzyme precusor, procarboxypeptidase Y, have defined a four-amino-acid motif in its propeptide that confers vacuolar sorting (35Valls L.A. Winther J.R. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); a receptor for this domain, the product of the vps10 gene, has recently been identified (20Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 579-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition, several members of the subtilisin protease family from diverse species of bacteria and yeast are synthesized as proenzymes in which the proregion is thought to act as an intramolecular chaperone facilitating correct folding and activation of the enzyme (29Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar; 39Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Most significantly, trans-expression of the propeptides of several of these enzymes from separate plasmids was shown to activate these proteases in vivo and in vitro (29Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar; 10Fabre E. Tharaud C. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15049-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 39Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In the case of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica extracellular alkaline protease, deletion of the propeptide resulted in its intracellular accumulation early in the secretory pathway, and trans-expression of the propeptide partially restored secretion of the mature enzyme (10Fabre E. Tharaud C. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15049-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of the TGF-β1 propeptide in trans together with TGF-β1 lacking its propeptide facilitated a low level of secretion of biologically active TGF-β1 (13Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To further understand the function of prohormones in intracellular sorting and processing, our laboratory has been investigating the trafficking of preproSRIF. The prosomatostatins comprise a prohormone family and are among the simplest of peptide hormone precursors. The mature 14-residue hormone, SRIF-14, is located at the carboxyl terminus of the propeptide and is preceded by an Arg-Lys pair at the processing site; these are the only dibasic amino acids in the precursor. Mammals possess a single gene that encodes a common precursor to both SRIF-14 and SRIF-28, the latter being a 14-residue NH2-terminally extended form of the tetradecapeptide (23Noe B.D. Spiess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In several species of fish, however, two distinct genes expressed in different populations of islet D-cells encode separate precursors, preproSRIF-I and II, from which are released the 14- and the 28-amino-acid peptides, respectively (23Noe B.D. Spiess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 22McDonald J.K. Gteiner F. Bauer G.E. Elde R.P. Noe B.D. J. Histochem.

Cytochem. 1987; 35: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our previous experiments showed that these two precursors had significantly different fates when their cDNAs were stably expressed in rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells. PreproSRIF-I, which displays substantial homology to mammalian SRIF precursors, was processed efficiently and accurately to the mature 14-amino-acid peptide and targeted to the regulated secretory pathway (32Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, proSRIF-II, which has much less homology to mammalian proSRIFs, was quantitatively degraded intracellularly in a chloroquine-sensitive post-TGN compartment (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the SRIF-I propeptide possesses positive sorting information, we hypothesized that it might divert proSRIF-II from the “degradation pathway” to secretory vesicles. To test this idea, we constructed a chimera comprising the SRIF-I signal and propeptide fused to proSRIF-II and introduced this cDNA into GH3 cells. Here we demonstrate that when expressed in cis but not in trans the SRIF-I propeptide rescued proSRIF-II from intracellular degradation. Furthermore, the chimera was processed to mature SRIF-28, the physiological cleavage product of proSRIF-II, and targeted to secretory vesicles. [3H]Leucine was purchased from Amersham Corp. [35S]Cysteine was purchased from DuPont NEN. Chloroquine was purchased from Sigma. Lipofectin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The mammalian expression vector pCEP4 containing a hygromycin selectable marker was purchased from InVitrogen. Reverse phase HPLC columns were purchased from Vydac (Hesperia, CA). Rabbit antisera specific for the propeptides of human SRIF and anglerfish SRIF-I and −II were prepared against recombinant antigens isolated from bacteria (9Elgort A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30668-30675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the serum specific for the SRIF-II propeptide was designated R60. The starting cDNAs for this construction were plasmids pDS5/pLAS I (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pLJ/pLAS-II (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding anglerfish preproSRIF-I and preproSRIF-II, respectively. A cDNA fragment I encoding the signal peptide and most of the propeptide of anglerfish preproSRIF-I (Fig. 1) was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides A (5′-CCCGGGATCCGCAGACGCCGGCAGA-3′) and B (5′-CTCTCTGTCGAGCTGTAGGTCGGCGTGGGC-3′) (reverse). Oligonucleotide B was a 30-mer containing 15 nucleotides from the carboxyl terminus of the SRIF-I propeptide (italics) and 15 nucleotides from the amino terminus of the preproSRIF-II propeptide. Fragment II encoding the pro- and mature peptides of anglerfish proSRIF-II was also generated by PCR using oligonucleotides C (5′-GCCCACGCCGACCTACAGCTCGACAGAGAG-3′) and D (5′-CCCGGGATCCGTTGGTCCGGTGACG-3′) (reverse). Oligonucleotide C was a 30-mer, containing 15 nucleotides from the SRIF-I propeptide (italics) and 15 from the amino terminus of the proSRIF-II propeptide. The chimeric cDNA was constructed by hybridizing fragment I and fragment II at their cohesive ends and amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide fragments A and D (Fig. 1). The resulting cDNA was digested with BamHI (both oligonucleotides A and D have the BamHI restriction site) and subcloned into vectors pTZ19R (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for DNA sequencing and pcDNA/neo (Invitrogen) for expression in GH3 cells. The fidelity of the chimeric cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing as well as by in vitro transcription and translation; the translation product was immunoprecipitable with antiserum R33, which is specific for SRIF-28 (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeric cDNA was transfected into GH3 cells using the Lipofectin procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were selected for growth in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) for 11 days. Several G418-resistant colonies were established; these were assayed for the expression of chimeric protein by pulse labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-SRIF-28 serum. One such colony designated GH3.C28.7 was chosen for further analysis; it should be noted that identical results were obtained with several of the other clonal lines (data not shown). cDNA encoding the signal peptide and proregion of human SRIF (9Elgort A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30668-30675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned directly into the BamHI site of the mammalian expression vector pCEP4. A cDNA fragment encoding the signal peptide and proregion of anglerfish SRIF-I was generated by PCR techniques such that a stop codon was introduced after Lys-107 (Fig. 1) and the fragment ligated into the pCEP4 expression vector. For selection of cells expressing the human or anglerfish SRIF-I propeptide, GH3.A107 cells expressing native proSRIF-II were transfected with the appropriate DNA and grown in the presence of 125 μg/ml of hygromycin for 10-14 days. Hygromycin-resistant cells were analyzed for the expression of the SRIF propeptide by pulse-chase followed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for each individual propeptide (9Elgort A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30668-30675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on mixed populations of hygromycin-resistant GH3.A107 cells. Confluent GH3.C28.7 cells grown in 35-mm tissue culture dishes, were washed twice with PBS, pulse-labeled in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 500 μCi/ml [35S]Cys for 15 min at 37°C, and chased for various times in growth medium containing 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum. The cell lysate and medium was adjusted to a final concentration of 156 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 100 units/ml Trasylol, 5 mM cysteine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Appropriate antibodies were added to each sample, and immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4°C followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed, CA) as described previously (32Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prior to gel electrophoresis, the beads were washed twice with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and twice with PBS, followed by boiling for 3 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (8.5% sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 200 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 5% SDS, 200 mM dithiothreitol, 0.005% bromphenol blue). For HPLC analysis, the protein A-Sepharose beads were suspended in 100 ml of TEU (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20 mM EDTA, 8 M urea) containing 80 mM dithiothreitol and incubated at 65°C for 20 min, centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was treated with iodoacetic acid (3.2 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to the samples to give a final concentration of 8%. Samples were applied to a Vydac C4 reverse-phase column using a Waters-Millipore HPLC system. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min with a gradient of 0-4 min 5% CH3CN; 4-6 min 5-16% CH3CN; 6-20 min 16-35% CH3CN; 20-34 min 35-45% CH3CN; 34-37 min 45-46% CH3CN; 37-39 min 46-80% CH3CN, all containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One-minute fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For peptide sequencing, a 100-mm dish of confluent GH3.C28.7 cells was labeled with 500 μCi/ml [35S]Cys, or 1 mCi/ml [3H]Leu for 2 h. The media and cell lysates were collected and incubated with SRIF-28 antiserum, and the immunoprecipitates combined. The immunoprecipitated peptides were resolved by HPLC, and the fractions corresponding to mature SRIF-28 were pooled, lyophilized, and subjected to 30 cycles of automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 301A sequencer. Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum as blocking agent, and incubated for 60 min with either a rabbit antisera directed against the SRIF-II propeptide (R60) or SRIF-28 (R33) together with a mouse monoclonal antibody 53FC3 against Golgi mannosidase II (5Burke B. Warren G. Cell. 1984; 36: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Samples were double labeled by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse serum and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum and examined using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope. Previous work from our laboratory has established that anglerfish preproSRIF-I and human proSRIF are processed efficiently to SRIF-14 with about 75% efficiency in GH3 cells, and approximately 60% of the mature hormone is sorted to the regulated secretory pathway in rat pituitary GH3 cells (32Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; 9Elgort A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30668-30675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, anglerfish proSRIF-II is degraded in an acidic post-Golgi compartment, and no mature SRIF-28 is processed from this precursor (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that proSRIF-II degradation occurred because either GH3 cells lack a prohormone processing enzyme that cleaves at the monobasic residue, to generate SRIF-28, or that the SRIF-II propeptide might be incorrectly folded and therefore would be functionally incompetent in GH3 cells. To distinguish between these two possibilities and since earlier studies (33Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) had demonstrated that anglerfish proSRIF-I and rat proSRIF contain positive sorting signals (28Sevarino K.A. Stork P. Ventimiglia R. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Cell. 1989; 57: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the SRIF-I propeptide might rescue proSRIF-II from intracellular degradation. To test this idea, we constructed a hybrid precursor containing the signal peptide and propeptide of anglerfish SRIF-I fused to proSRIF-II (Fig. 1) and expressed this chimera in GH3 cells. To exclude the possibility of prohormone processing occurring at sites present in the SRIF-I propeptide, the chimera possessed a truncated SRIF-I proregion comprising the first 66 residues of the propeptide, which lacks both the monobasic and dibasic cleavage sites (Fig. 1) fused to the entire proregion (74 amino acids) and mature hormone (28 amino acids) of preproSRIF-II. The sequence of the chimera was confirmed by DNA sequencing and by in vitro transcription and translation followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-SRIF-28 serum (data not shown). We had previously shown that proSRIF-II degradation occurred in a compartment distal to the 20°C temperature block, i.e. in a post-TGN compartment (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the SRIF-I propeptide could rescue proSRIF-II from degradation, GH3.C28.7 cells expressing the chimera were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]Cys, an amino acid present only in the carboxyl-terminal mature SRIF peptide, and chased for 2 h either at 37 or 20°C followed by subsequent incubation at 37°C for up to 3 h. At each time point, the cell lysate and medium were treated with anti-SRIF-28 serum, followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). A major SRIF-28 immunoreactive polypeptide (Mr 24,000) was evident in GH3.C28.7 cells after the initial pulse labeling and 2 h of chase at 20°C (lanes 1 and 3). Following the temperature shift from 20 to 37°C, this 24-kDa chimera disappeared from the cells (lanes 4 and 5) and was secreted into the medium (lanes 9 and 10). Similarly, the SRIF-28-immunoreactive chimera was also secreted when the cells were chased only at 37°C (lanes 2 and 7). Consistent with our previous data (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubation at 20°C inhibited secretion, and the chimera was retained in the cells (lanes 3 and 8). In contrast to the behavior of the chimeric precursor, when GH3.A107 cells expressing native proSRIFII were chased at 37°C for 2 h, the level of intracellular proSRIF-II was diminished, but no SRIF-immunoreactive material was recovered in the medium (lanes 12 and 17). As previously observed (8Danoff A. Cutler D.A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10004-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubation at 20°C prevented proSRIF-II degradation (lane 13); however, subsequent chase at 37°C (lanes 14 and 15) resulted in its loss from the cells, and no SRIF-28 material was recovered in the medium (lanes 19 and 20) due to its intracellular turnover. The preceding data showed that the SRIF-I propeptide rescued proSRIF-II from intracellular degradation. However, we were unable to determine if the chimera was processed correctly to SRIF-28 using SDS-PAGE because it was too small to resolve accurately; we therefore used HPLC methods. GH3.C28.7 cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]Cys and chased for 2 h at 37°C followed by immunoprecipitation of the intracellular and secreted material with anti SRIF-28 antibodies, and the peptides were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 3A). Following the initial pulse labeling, a major intracellular polypeptide corresponding to unprocessed chimera (panel A, fraction 34) was evident. During the 2-h chase, the chimera was processed to a polypeptide with the identical retention time as mature SRIF-28 suggesting that it was processed correctly (panels C and D, fraction 13) and interestingly, no SRIF-14 was evident. Since the processed form of the chimera had an HPLC retention time that was identical to SRIF-28 (Fig. 3A) and migrated on SDS-PAGE at about 3-4 kDa, the expected size of SRIF-28 (data not shown), this suggested that it was correctly processed to mature SRIF-28. To test this directly, cells were labeled with [3H]Leu or [35S]Cys, the cell lysate and media were incubated with anti-SRIF-28, the immunoprecipitated material was combined, and the SRIF-28 polypeptide was separated by HPLC. The HPLC-purified SRIF-28 peptide (fraction 13) was subjected to 30 cycles of Edman degradation (Fig. 4). If cleavage of the chimera occurred correctly at the single Arg-processing site of proSRIF-II (Fig. 1), then [3H]Leu radioactivity should be detected at cycle 8 and [35S]Cys radioactivity should be present at cycles 17 and 28 of Edman degradation. The data of Fig. 4 demonstrate that this was correct; as expected, Leu was present at residue 8, and cysteine was detected at 17. Due to loss of material from the sequencer at each cycle and decreased repetitive yield, we were unable to detect significant levels of [35S]Cys radioactivity above background levels at residue 28. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that the chimera was cleaved correctly to yield SRIF-28, the physiological processing product of proSRIF-II. To determine the processing efficiency and secretion kinetics of the chimera, GH3.C28.7 cells were labeled for 15 min with [35S]Cys and chased for various times up to 6 h, and the intracellular and secreted SRIF-28 immunoreactive material was quantitated after HPLC analysis (Fig. 3B). Following a lag of ~15 min, the unprocessed chimera was secreted linearly for up to 90 min. After 3 h of chase, approximately 75-80% of the pulse labeled precursor was secreted. In addition, processing of the chimera, which was approximately 40-45% efficient, was evident only following a lag time of 30-60 min, presumably the time taken to reach the intracellular site where the processing enzyme is located, and was linear for approximately 3 h, after which time it reached a plateau (Fig. 3B); these processing kinetics were virtually identical to those of native proSRIF-I in GH3 cells (32Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that proSRIF processing, which can be initiated in the TGN, requires an acidic pH that is generated by a bafilomycin-sensitive vacuolar H+-ATPase, and recently we demonstrated that proSRIF processing in the TGN occurs at pH 6.1 (33Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar; 36Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Xu H. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22875-22881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since an aspartyl protease, with an acidic optimum, possibly the mammalian homologue of the S. cerevisiae Yap3 enzyme, has been implicated in proSRIF-II processing (6Cawley N.X. Noe B.D. Loh Y.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; 2Bourbonnais Y. Ash J. Daigle M. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that processing of the chimera would also be dependent on an acidic pH. Cells were pretreated with or without 40 μM chloroquine and pulse-labeled with [35S]Cys for 15 min followed by a 2-h chase in the absence or presence o"
