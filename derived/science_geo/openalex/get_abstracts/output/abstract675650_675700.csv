Their study uncovers molecular mechanisms by which molnupiravir drives SARS-CoV-2 into error catastrophe. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 raised the alarm on the potential threat of coronaviruses to human health. Today, we are witnessing a huge pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected millions of people, while causing more than 3.7 million deaths around the world. Although a handful of vaccines are now available, there is a lack of effective antiviral drugs to fight the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases (the largest of all RNA virus genomes). The coronavirus genome encodes nonstructural proteins that are responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome, the main component of which is a multifunctional protein that contains a central RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain (1Hillen H.S. Structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2021; 48: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Viral polymerases are common targets of antiviral intervention, and nucleoside and nucleotide analogues constitute the backbone of the most effective antiviral therapies (2Ma Y. Frutos-Beltrán E. Kang D. Pannecouque C. De Clercq E. Menéndez-Arias L. Liu X. Zhan P. Medicinal chemistry strategies for discovering antivirals effective against drug-resistant viruses.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2021; 50: 4514-4540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A nucleotide analogue known as remdesivir remains as the only drug approved by regulatory agencies to treat COVID-19. However, some clinical studies have failed to confirm its beneficial effects. In addition, the drug is difficult to synthesize, expensive, and has to be administered intravenously in a hospital setting. These attributes are undesirable in the context of a pandemic and efforts have been focused on the development of alternative inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Among them, molnupiravir has emerged as a promising new drug targeting the coronavirus RNA polymerase. Molnupiravir is the isopropylester prodrug of the ribonucleoside analogue β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC). NHC is a broad-spectrum antiviral compound that inhibits the replication of multiple viruses in cell culture (e.g., Chikungunya virus, Venezuela equine encephalitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, norovirus, influenza A and B viruses, Ebola virus, and human coronaviruses) (3Agostini M.L.

Virol. 2019; 93e01348-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The triphosphorylated derivative of NHC is a substrate for viral RNA polymerases and interferes with viral replication. In cell culture assays, molnupiravir was found to be a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC50 in the submicromolar range (3Agostini M.L. Pruijssers A.J. Chappell J.D. Gribble J.

This inhibitory effect was also observed in animal models such as Syrian hamsters and humanized mice (5Rosenke K. Hansen F. Schwarz B. Feldmann F. Haddock E. Rosenke R. Barbian K. Meade-White K.

Med. 2021; 12eabb5883Crossref Google Scholar), and NHC administration to infected ferrets prevented SARS-CoV-2 transmission to untreated and uninfected animals (7Cox R.M. Wolf J.D. Plemper R.K.

Molnupiravir is currently in phase II/III clinical trials based on encouraging preclinical data and its lack of toxicity and adverse side effects in phase I clinical trials. Studies carried out in cell culture with alphaviruses and coronaviruses have shown the mutagenic action of NHC, inducing G to A and C to U transitions in a dose-dependent manner. However, the biochemical events mediating these effects had not been studied at a biochemical level. In their recent work, Gordon et al. (8Gordon C.J. Tchesnokov E.P. Schinazi R.F. Götte M. Molnupiravir promotes SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis via the RNA template.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297 (100770)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) used a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp holoenzyme and various RNA-RNA template primers to determine nucleotide incorporation efficiencies for NHC triphosphate and natural ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) in different sequence contexts. Although accurate determinations of kpol (polymerase catalytic rate constant) and Kd (nucleotide binding affinity) were not obtained, their results clearly showed that all rNTPs are more efficiently incorporated than the NHC triphosphate. However, as expected, the most efficient competition was observed with cytosine triphosphate (CTP). In a different set of experiments, Gordon et al. found that once incorporated, primers having NHC monophosphate at their 3’ end were efficiently extended, particularly at high rNTP concentrations. This observation led the authors to investigate whether a template NHC could have an impact on the generation of errors during SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. An RNA template containing an embedded NHC monophosphate was synthesized and used in RNA elongation experiments, which demonstrated the formation of both NHC:A and NHC:G base pairs. However, efficient extension was only observed in the case of NHC:A base pairing. These biochemical data led the authors to propose a model to explain the mutagenic antiviral action of NHC (Fig. 1). While the formation of NHC:G base pairs could lead to RNA synthesis inhibition, NHC:A pairing induced mutagenesis by increasing G to A and C to U transition frequencies, in agreement with evidence collected from previous experiments carried out in vitro and in vivo (3Agostini M.L. Pruijssers A.J. Chappell J.D. Gribble J. Lu X. Andres E.L. Bluemling G.R. Lockwood M.A. Sheahan T.P. Sims A.C. Natchus M.G. Saindane M. Kolykhalov A.A. Painter G.R.

Hill C.S. et al.An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and multiple coronaviruses in mice.Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 12eabb5883Crossref Google Scholar). The RdRp holoenzyme used in the experiments lacked the exoribonuclease protein found in the SARS-CoV-2 replicase-transcriptase complex; however, the proofreading activity of the related MERS-CoV protein is effectively inhibited by NHC (3Agostini M.L. Pruijssers A.J. Chappell J.D. Gribble J. Lu X. Andres E.L. Bluemling G.R. Lockwood M.A. Sheahan T.P. Sims A.C. Natchus M.G. Saindane M. Kolykhalov A.A. Painter G.R.

Virol. 2019; 93e01348-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and therefore, the conclusions drawn on molnupiravir action for the RNA polymerase holoenzyme are expected to be valid for the full replicase-transcriptase complex. Lethal mutagenesis is a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that exploits the high mutation rate and low mutational tolerance of many RNA viruses. A number of successful viral extinctions in cell culture using other mutagenic nucleosides have been reported. However, lethal mutagenesis still needs validation in animals and humans. A mutagenic effect has been shown in different viruses for approved nucleosides such as ribavirin and favipiravir. While ribavirin increases G to A and C to U mutation frequencies, favipiravir facilitates A to G and U to C transitions (reviewed in ref. (9Perales C. Gallego I. de Ávila A.I. Soria M.E. Gregori J. Quer J. Domingo E. The increasing impact of lethal mutagenesis of viruses.Future Med. Chem. 2019; 11: 1645-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). Approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza, favipiravir is also licensed in China and Russia for COVID-19 treatment. A recent study by Zhou et al. (10Zhou S. Hill C.S. Sarkar S. Tse L.V. Woodburn B.M.D. Schinazi R.F. Sheahan T.P. Baric R.S. Heise M.T. Swanstrom R. β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 through lethal mutagenesis but is also mutagenic to mammalian cells.J. Infect. Dis. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab247Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that NHC is more than 100-fold more active than ribavirin and favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2, while the observed activity correlated with an increased mutation frequency in the viral RNA. It would be interesting to see whether the methodological approach of Gordon et al. (8Gordon C.J. Tchesnokov E.P. Schinazi R.F. Götte M. Molnupiravir promotes SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis via the RNA template.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297 (100770)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) could throw some light on the potential mechanism of action of favipiravir in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections. Available evidence suggests that molnupiravir could become a paradigmatic example in the use of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy. However, there are inherent risks in this approach. NHC can be metabolized by the host cell to the 2′-deoxyribonucleoside form by the ribonucleotide reductase and then incorporated into the host cell DNA. The mutagenic effect of NHC has been shown in animal cell cultures (10Zhou S. Hill C.S. Sarkar S. Tse L.V. Woodburn B.M.D. Schinazi R.F. Sheahan T.P. Baric R.S. Heise M.T.

Dis. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab247Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), raising concerns on the potential risk of molnupiravir-induced tumorigenesis and the emergence of detrimental mutations in sperm precursor cell generation and embryo development. The author declares that he has no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article."

https://openalex.org/W3172048357,"Humans and animals can be strongly motivated to seek information to resolve uncertainty about rewards and punishments. In particular, despite its clinical and societal relevance, very little is known about information seeking about punishments. We show that attitudes toward information about punishments and rewards are distinct and separable at both behavioral and neuronal levels. We demonstrate the existence of prefrontal neuronal populations that anticipate opportunities to gain information in a relatively valence-specific manner, separately anticipating information about either punishments or rewards. These neurons are located in anatomically interconnected subregions of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) in area 12o/47. Unlike ACC, vlPFC also contains a population of neurons that integrate attitudes toward both reward and punishment information, to encode the overall preference for information in a bivalent manner. This cortical network is well suited to mediate information seeking by integrating the desire to resolve uncertainty about multiple, distinct motivational outcomes."

In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.

Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is required for anchorage-dependent cell survival and growth in multicellular organisms. During the G1 commitment phase of the cell cycle, adhesion signaling is required to initiate DNA synthesis (1Assoian R.K. Anchorage-dependent cell cycle progression.J.

Integrins and anoikis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). However, how changes in adhesion signaling are able to influence cell cycle progression in adherent cells is only partly elucidated. During mitosis, major changes in integrin adhesion complexes (IACs), cytoskeletal architecture, and cell shape are obligatory for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (5Lesman A. Notbohm J.

Despite the risks to tissue integrity, the optimally symmetrical geometry of a sphere appears to enable the high degree of precision required for chromosome capture and division plane orientation (9Toyoshima F.

All of these changes are highly conserved, implying the existence of a primordial regulatory mechanism linking the cell cycle and adhesion machineries. One link between the cell cycle and adhesion is mediated through the master regulator of the cell cycle, cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1). CDK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that partners with cyclins that control both kinase activity and substrate specificity (15Lim S. Kaldis P. Cdks, cyclins and CKIs: Roles beyond cell cycle regulation.Development. 2013; 140: 3079-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). CDK1 inhibition leads to disassembly of IACs, suggesting that CDK1 activity has an interphase role in promoting integrin-mediated adhesion and actomyosin organization (12Jones M.C. Askari J.A.

Commun. 2015; 6: 1-13Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IAC area increases during S phase in a CDK1-dependent manner, then inhibition of CDK1 through Wee1-mediated phosphorylation in G2 causes IAC loss in preparation for entry into mitosis (12Jones M.C.

Together, these findings identify a key role for CDK1 in the regulation of adhesion during cell cycle progression. Talins are large (270 kDa) multidomain proteins composed of an N-terminal head coupled to a large rod comprising 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) (17Goult B.T. Zacharchenko T. Bate N. Tsang R. Hey F.

The two talin isoforms (talin-1/TLN1 and talin-2/TLN2) are considered to be the principal proteins that couple integrins to F-actin.

Talin binding to integrins is maintained by actomyosin-generated force and results in conformational activation of integrins (20Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J.G. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H.

The linkage therefore provides a regulatable means of controlling cell adhesion to the ECM from within the cell. This trimolecular core also initiates the recruitment of a large number of additional proteins, termed the adhesome, which varies in composition between IAC type (24Winograd-Katz S.E. Fässler R.

Cell Biol. 2020; 219e202003038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reflecting distinct effector, signaling, and mechanosensing functions. The role of talin as a key mechanotransducer relies on its ability to undergo force-dependent structural rearrangements. As force from actin is exerted on talin anchored to integrins, the talin rod gradually unfolds at discrete sites, resulting in both the displacement and recruitment of signaling proteins. This enables talin to serve as a mechanosensitive signaling hub, integrating a wide range of signals to produce diverse cellular responses (27Goult B.T. Yan J. Schwartz M.A. Talin as a mechanosensitive signaling hub.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 3776-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we identify a direct interaction between CDK1 and talin through an unbiased analysis of talin-binding proteins. CDK1 contains a talin-binding LD motif that interacts directly with the R8 domain of talin. This interaction is required for regulating CDK1 function at IACs and leads to an alteration in the mechanosensitivity of talin. Direct mechanical coupling of the master cell cycle regulator and the principal integrin effector provides an elegant mechanism coupling the cell division and adhesion machineries to facilitate proliferation in a multicellular environment. To identify novel talin-binding proteins, full-length talin-1 fused to GFP was expressed in U2OS cells and interacting proteins identified by GFP-Trap pull-down and mass spectrometry. Multiple proteins were identified, including previously characterized ligands such as vinculin, integrins, and two of the four KANK (KN Motif and Ankyrin Repeat Domains) proteins, KANK2 and KANK3 (Fig. 1A and Table S1). In addition, peptides covering a large proportion of CDK1 (SAINT Score 0.96) were detected with high confidence in all three talin pull-downs, but never in the GFP controls, suggesting that CDK1 also associates with talin. The mass spectrometry data were confirmed by western blotting of the GFP-talin pull-down with anti-CDK1 antibody (Fig. 1B). To support these findings, CDK1 was tagged with BirA∗, expressed in U2OS cells, and BioID proximity biotinylation employed to label proteins close to CDK1 in situ. Using this approach, 118 labeled proteins were identified, including the known CDK1 interactors, cyclin B1 and cyclin B2 (Table S2). 47% of the identified proteins were found within the meta adhesome, suggestive of a role for CDK1 in regulating adhesion/cytoskeletal dynamics (28Horton E.R. Astudillo P. Humphries M.J. Humphries J.D. Mechanosensitivity of integrin adhesion complexes: Role of the consensus adhesome.Exp. Cell Res. 2016; 343: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in addition to talin, the core adhesome components, vinculin, paxillin, filamin A, and CRK, were in close proximity to CDK1 (Fig. 1C). Finally, TIRF microscopy was employed to determine the localization of CDK1 at the cell–ECM interface. mScarlet-CDK1 was distributed in elongated, fleck-like structures that partially overlapped with GFP-talin-containing IACs (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these findings indicate a close association between talin and CDK1 at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM. We next aimed to identify the binding interface between talin and CDK1. Talin contains multiple binding sites for proteins that contain leucine/aspartic acid LD motifs, with a consensus sequence I/LDxØØxØØ (where Ø denotes a hydrophobic residue) (29Alam T. Alazmi M.

This mode of binding allows mechanosensitive regulation as it only occurs when the talin rod domain mediating the interaction is folded: unfolding due to mechanical force disrupts the LD motif binding site and the connection is severed (27Goult B.T.

Analysis of the CDK1 protein sequence identified a highly conserved, consensus LD motif sequence between residues 206 and 223 (Fig. 2, A and B), which we postulated might bind directly to talin. Fluorescence polarization was employed to test direct binding, as described previously (33Whitewood A.J. Singh A.K. Brown D.G. Goult B.T.

In this assay, a synthetic peptide spanning the CDK1 LD motif, CDK1(206–223), is fluorescently tagged and titrated against an increasing concentration of unlabeled talin fragment; any binding between the two polypeptides results in an increase in the fluorescence polarization signal. To identify the putative CDK1-binding site(s) on talin, six talin fragments were generated that span the whole molecule; F0-F3, R1-R3, R4-R8, R9-R10, R11-R12 and R13-DD (Fig. 2C). Two of these fragments incorporate the actin-binding sites in the talin rod, ABS2 (R4-R8 (23Atherton P. Stutchbury B. Wang D.-Y. Jethwa D. Tsang R. Meiler-Rodriguez E. Wang P. Bate N. Zent R.

No significant interaction was observed between CDK1(206–223) and the talin Head, R9-R10, R11-R12, or R13-DD fragments; however, R4-R8 demonstrated increasing fluorescence polarization with increasing talin concentration, indicative of a direct interaction (Fig. 2D). We note that a small change in polarization was also detected with the R1-R3 fragment; however, this interaction was too weak to be quantified and is possibly the result of a nonspecific LD interaction with the LD motif binding sites in R2 and R3 that bind the LD motifs in RIAM (17Goult B.T.

To further define the CDK1-binding site within talin R4-R8, we tested binding to additional rod domain constructs. Talin R4-R6 demonstrated negligible binding to CDK1(206–223), whereas R7R8 bound to CDK1(206–223) with a Kd of 15 μM (Fig. 2E). The R7R8 region of both talin isoforms, talin-1 and talin-2, bound CDK1(206–223) with similar affinity (Fig. 2E). As found for other LD motif peptides (34Bouchet B.P. Gough R.E.

HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled talin-1 R7R8 were collected in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of CDK1(206–223) peptide (Fig. 3D). Addition of CDK1(206–223) peptide, but not CDK1-2A, resulted in progressive chemical shift changes to a subset of the R8 residues, indicative of a direct, specific interaction. Using the chemical shift assignments of the R8 domain of talin-1 (BMRB ID:19339 (32Zacharchenko T. Qian X. Goult B.T. Jethwa D. Almeida T.B. Ballestrem C. Critchley D.R. Lowy D.R. Barsukov I.L.

To support the requirement for the talin R8 domain in interacting with CDK1, GFP-Trap pull-downs were performed using wild-type (WT) full-length talin or talin lacking the R8 domain (ΔR8). WT-talin-1-GFP pulled down HA-tagged CDK1-WT, but not HA-CDK1-2A, whereas ΔR8-talin-1-GFP failed to associate with HA-CDK1-WT (Fig. 3F). To resolve the structural basis of the talin-CDK1 interaction, the R7R8-CDK1 peptide complex was crystallized and the structure determined to 2.28 Å resolution (Fig. 4, A and B). The structure contained two R7R8 molecules within the asymmetric unit, each with CDK1 peptides localized to the respective R8 domains (Fig. S1A; Table S3). Each peptide was exceptionally resolved in both the F0-FC weighted difference map and simulated annealing OMIT maps (Fig. S1, B and C). Unexpectedly, the CDK1 peptide was oriented perpendicular to the helices of the R8 fold, forming a pseudo-5-helix bundle (Fig. 4, A and B) that contrasts with the helix-addition mechanism of DLC1 and RIAM (32Zacharchenko T.

This arrangement was supported by NMR chemical shift mapping (Fig. 3E), where the shift changes upon addition of CDK1 peptide were located predominantly at one end of the LD motif binding surface of the bundle. The CDK1 peptide was identified on the basis of sequence homology with the LD motif. In previous studies of LD motif recognition, the aspartate residue of the LD motif was shown to form a salt bridge with a positively charged residue on the cognate-binding site (40Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E.M. Labesse G. Campbell I.D. Werner J.M. Arold S.T. Molecular recognition of paxillin LD motifs by the focal adhesion targeting domain.Structure. 2003; 11: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and in the case of DLC1, mutation of talin K1544 abolished interactions with R8 (32Zacharchenko T.

The CDK1-talin structure deviated from this shared interaction mechanism as K1544 was not involved in the interaction, but instead oriented away from the CDK1-binding site. The isoleucine side chain of the LD motif was responsible for displacing the K1544 side chain and an ID/AA double mutation attenuated the CDK1-talin interaction (Fig. 4B). The remainder of the CDK1 peptide formed a hydrophobic interface with the R8 domain with the CDK1 214FRIFRA219 sequence buried into a hydrophobic groove between the helices formed of talin residues L1492, A1495, V1498, L1539, V1540, and I1543 (Fig. 4B). The CDK1 sequence formed an amphipathic helix that closely resembled its conformation in full-length CDK1 (PDB ID: 4YC6 (41Brown N.R. Korolchuk S. Martin M.P. Stanley W.A. Moukhametzianov R.

Commun. 2015; 6: 1-12Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar)), where the key residues involved in talin binding are surface exposed (Fig. S2). The structure of this lobe of the kinase has been solved in complex with other proteins such as CKS1 (cyclin-dependent regulatory subunit 1) (41Brown N.R. Korolchuk S. Martin M.P. Stanley W.A.

As the CDK1 LD motif peptide superimposed on the CDK1 structure, it was possible to model the interaction between talin and the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex (Fig. 4, E and F). This demonstrated that the talin–CDK1 interaction is unlikely to perturb CDK1 binding to regulatory cyclin proteins and suggests the possibility that talin"

Methods We adopted Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID) databases to screen the active ingredients and potential targets of XCHT. CRC-related targets were retrieved by analyzing published microarray data (accession number GSE110224) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The common targets were used to construct the “herb-active ingredient-target” network using the Cytoscape 3.8.0 software. Next, we constructed and analyzed protein-to-protein interaction (PPI) using BisoGenet and CytoNCA plug-in in Cytoscape. We then performed Gene Ontology (GO) functional and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of target genes using the R package of clusterProfiler. Furthermore, we used the AutoDock Tools software to conduct molecular docking studies on the active ingredients and key targets to verify the network pharmacological analysis results. Results We identified a total of 71 active XCHT ingredients and 20 potential anti-CRC targets. The network analysis revealed quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, baicalein, and acacetin as potential key compounds, and PTGS2, NR3C2, CA2, and MMP1 as potential key targets. The active ingredients of XCHT interacted with most CRC disease targets. We showed that XCHT’s therapeutic effect was attributed to its synergistic action (multi-compound, multi-target, and multi-pathway). Our GO enrichment analysis showed 46 GO entries, including 20 biological processes, 6 cellular components, and 20 molecular functions. We identified 11 KEGG signaling pathways, including the IL-17, TNF, Toll-like receptor, and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Our results showed that XCHT could play a role in CRC treatment by regulating different signaling pathways. The molecular docking experiment confirmed the correlation between five core compounds (quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, baicalein, and acacetin) just as well as PTGS2, NR3C2, CA2, and MMP1. Conclusion In this study, we described the potential active ingredients, possible targets, and key biological pathways responsible for the efficacy of XCHT in CRC treatment, providing a theoretical basis for further research."

Methods Using cases and death data from the national population-based surveillance system of Peru, we estimated incidence, mortality and fatality, stratified by sex, age and geographic distribution (per 100,000 habitants) from March 16 to November 27, 2020. At the same time, we calculated the risk of COVID-19 death. Results During the study period, 961894 cases and 35913 deaths were reported in Peru. Men had a twofold higher risk of COVID-19 death within the overall population of Peru (odds ratio (OR), 2.11; confidence interval (CI) 95%; 2.06–2.16; p &lt;0.00001), as well as 20 regions of Peru, compared to women ( p &lt;0.05). There were variations in incidence, mortality and fatality rates stratified by sex, age, and region. The incidence rate was higher among men than among women (3079 vs. 2819 per 100,000 habitants, respectively). The mortality rate was two times higher in males than in females (153 vs. 68 per 100,000 habitants, respectively). The mortality rates increased with age, and were high in men 60 years of age or older. The fatality rate was two times higher in men than in women (4.96% vs. 2.41%, respectively), and was high in men 50 years of age or older. Conclusions These findings show the higher incidence, mortality and fatality rates among men than among women from Peru. These rates vary widely by region, and men are at greater risk of COVID-19 death. In addition, the mortality and fatality rates increased with age, and were most predominant in men 50 years of age or older."

The aim of this study was to determine if mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from human bone marrow are able to emit signals that induce this migratory activity in cancer cells. We separated the supernatant of MSCs derived from human bone marrow by size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography and have subsequently studied the migratory behavior of the prostate cancer cell line PC3 and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 toward the respective fractions in a transwell migration assay. We identified the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins type I collagen, type III collagen, fibronectin, and laminin 421 as potential drivers of cancer cell migration. These results could be reproduced using the corresponding isolated or recombinant ECM proteins. Knockdown of the gene encoding beta 1 integrin, an important cell surface receptor for fibronectin, has led to inhibition of cancer cell migration. This supports the hypothesis that beta 1 integrin signaling represents an initial event that leads to metastasis, and that signaling is triggered by binding of integrin heterodimers to ECM molecules. Further characterization of signaling factors and their respective receptors will have implications for anticancer drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3170408830,"Abstract Dickkopf1 (DKK1) is overexpressed in various cancers and promotes cancer cell proliferation by binding to cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4). However, the mechanisms underlying DKK1 expression are poorly understood. RNA sequence analysis revealed that expression of the transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and its target genes concordantly fluctuated with expression of DKK1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. DKK1 knockdown decreased FOXM1 expression and vice versa in PDAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. Inhibition of either the DKK1-CKAP4-AKT pathway or the ERK pathway suppressed FOXM1 expression, and simultaneous inhibition of both pathways showed synergistic effects. A FOXM1 binding site was identified in the 5ʹ-untranslated region of the DKK1 gene, and its depletion decreased DKK1 expression and cancer cell proliferation. Clinicopathological and database analysis revealed that PDAC and ESCC patients who simultaneously express DKK1 and FOXM1 have a poorer prognosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that expression of both DKK1 and FOXM1 is the independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients. Although it has been reported that FOXM1 enhances Wnt signaling, FOXM1 induced DKK1 expression independently of Wnt signaling in PDAC and ESCC cells. These results suggest that DKK1 and FOXM1 create a positive feedback loop to promote cancer cell proliferation."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the hematological parameters of type 2 diabetic adult patients at Debre Berhan Referral Hospital, Northeast Ethiopia from May 01 to June 30, 2020.A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on 268 (134 type 2 diabetic patients and 134 controls) study participants selected by systematic random sampling technique. Socio-demographic, behavioral, and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire and checklist. Ethical approval was obtained from Jimma University. All phase of quality assurance was maintained. Hematological parameters and blood glucose levels were determined using UniCel DxH 800 (Beckman Coulter, USA) and Biosystems A25 (Costa Brava, Spain) analyzers, respectively. Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, correlation, and logistic regression were used during data analysis. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.The current study found that total white blood cell count, absolute counts of neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and basophil, red blood cell distribution width, platelet count, and mean platelet volume were significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients as compared to the control group (P<0.05). On the other hand, the mean hemoglobin was significantly lower in type 2 diabetic patients than the control group (P = 0.007). Anemia was found in 17.9% of type 2 diabetic patients.

Anemia among type 2 diabetic patients was found to be a mild public health problem. Therefore, routine screening of hematological parameters should be considered for proper management of type 2 diabetic patients.

However, intra-specific differences in ITS2 of Anopheles stephensi have been reported. This study reports the presence of intragenomic sequence variation in the ITS2-rDNA of An. stephensi and hypothesizes that observed intra-specific differences in this species may have resulted due to ambiguous DNA sequence-chromatogram resulting from intragenomic heterogeneity. Anopheles stephensi collected from different parts of India were sequenced for complete ITS2 and the variable region of 28S-rDNA (d1-d3 domains). Intragenomic variations were found in ITS2 region of all An. stephensi sequenced, but no such variation was observed in d1 to d3 domains of 28S-rDNA. Cloning and sequencing of ITS2 through the d3 domain of the 28S region of rDNA from representative samples from northern, central, and southern India confirmed the presence of intragenomic variation in ITS2 due to transitions at three loci and two bp indel in a di-nucleotide microsatellite locus. Multiple haplotypes were observed in ITS2 raised from such variations. Due to the absence of detectable intragenomic sequence variation in the d1 to d3 domain of 28S rDNA of An. stephensi, this region can serve as an ideal reference sequence for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies. The presence of intragenomic variation in rDNA should be carefully examined before using this as a molecular marker for species delimitation or phylogenetic analyses."

We prospectively included all patients with a routine laboratory or clinical diagnosis of TB made at PHC or hospital level in Khayelitsha and Tygerberg sub-districts in Cape Town, using routine TB data from an integrated provincial health data centre between October 2018 and March 2020. Overall, 74% (10,208/13,736) of TB patients were diagnosed at PHC facilities and ILTFU was 20.0% (2,742/13,736). Of ILTFU patients, 17.1% (468/2,742) died, with 69.7% (326/468) of deaths occurring within 30 days of diagnosis. Most ILTFU deaths (85.5%; 400/468) occurred in patients diagnosed in hospital. Multivariable logistic regression identified increasing age, HIV positive status, and hospital-based TB diagnosis (higher in the absence of TB treatment initiation and being ILTFU) as predictors of mortality. Although hospitals account for a modest proportion of diagnosed TB patients they have high TB-associated mortality. A hospital-based TB diagnosis is a critical opportunity to identify those at high risk of early and overall mortality. Interventions to diagnose TB before hospital admission, improve linkage to TB treatment following diagnosis, and reduce mortality in hospital-diagnosed TB patients should be prioritised."
https://openalex.org/W3172460958,"SOS1 ablation causes specific defective phenotypes in MEFs including increased levels of intracellular ROS. We showed that the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO restores normal endogenous ROS levels, suggesting predominant involvement of mitochondria in generation of this defective SOS1-dependent phenotype. The absence of SOS1 caused specific alterations of mitochondrial shape, mass, and dynamics accompanied by higher percentage of dysfunctional mitochondria and lower rates of electron transport in comparison to WT or SOS2-KO counterparts. SOS1-deficient MEFs also exhibited specific alterations of respiratory complexes and their assembly into mitochondrial supercomplexes and consistently reduced rates of respiration, glycolysis, and ATP production, together with distinctive patterns of substrate preference for oxidative energy metabolism and dependence on glucose for survival. RASless cells showed defective respiratory/metabolic phenotypes reminiscent of those of SOS1-deficient MEFs, suggesting that the mitochondrial defects of these cells are mechanistically linked to the absence of SOS1-GEF activity on cellular RAS targets. Our observations provide a direct mechanistic link between SOS1 and control of cellular oxidative stress and suggest that SOS1-mediated RAS activation is required for correct mitochondrial dynamics and function."

Here, we compare the previously established peroxiredoxin-based H2O2 probe roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR with the newly described OxyR-based H2O2 probe HyPer7, using yeast as the model system. Although not as sensitive as roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR, HyPer7 is much improved relative to earlier HyPer versions, most notably by ratiometric pH stability. The most striking difference between the two probes is the dynamics of intracellular probe reduction. HyPer7 is rapidly reduced, predominantly by the thioredoxin system, whereas roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR is reduced more slowly, predominantly by the glutathione system. We discuss the pros and cons of each probe and suggest that future side-by-side measurements with both probes may provide information on the relative activity of the two major cellular reducing systems.

The development of genetically encoded redox probes for the specific sensing of small-molecule oxidants (e.g., H2O2) and redox couples (e.g., GSH/GSSG) has advanced the field of redox biology (1Schwarzlander M. Dick T.P. Meyer A.J. Morgan B. Dissecting redox biology using fluorescent protein sensors.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2016; 24: 680-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such probes provide information on chemically defined redox changes as they occur in living cells, in real time and with subcellular resolution. They have enabled the identification of physiological and pathophysiological redox changes, for example, in development and injury (2Kostyuk A.I. Panova A.S. Kokova A.D. Kotova D.A. Maltsev D.I. Podgorny O.V. Belousov V.V. Bilan D.S. In vivo imaging with genetically encoded redox biosensors.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 8164Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two major types of genetically encoded probes are most commonly used for sensing H2O2. Both are fusion proteins in which a fluorescent protein is linked to an H2O2-reactive domain. Both are dynamic, meaning that they reflect the interplay between probe oxidation by H2O2 and probe reduction by intracellular reducing systems. Both are excitation-ratiometric, meaning that dual excitation provides emission ratios indicative of the probe’s redox state. One type are the roGFP2-thiol peroxidase fusion proteins, specifically roGFP2-Orp1 (3Gutscher M. Sobotta M.C. Wabnitz G.H. Ballikaya S. Meyer A.J. Samstag Y. Dick T.P.

In these constructs, selective reactivity toward H2O2 is facilitated by a thiol peroxidase domain, from either the glutathione peroxidase or peroxiredoxin (Prx) family. The peroxidatic cysteine reacts with H2O2 to form a disulfide bond, which is then rearranged by thiol–disulfide exchange to create a disulfide bond on the surface of the attached roGFP2 domain (reviewed in (7Roma L.P. Deponte M. Riemer J. Morgan B. Mechanisms and applications of redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein-based hydrogen peroxide probes.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2018; 29: 552-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). The roGFP2 disulfide bond causes a small conformational change on the inside of the β-barrel, which in turn alters the protonation state of the chromophore, thus facilitating the ratiometric measurement. The roGFP2 disulfide bond is susceptible to reduction by the glutathione system, but is fully resistant to reduction by thioredoxin (Trx) (8Gutscher M. Pauleau A.L. Marty L. Brach T. Wabnitz G.H.

The other type are the cpYFP-OxyR fusion proteins, in which a circularly permuted fluorescent protein is inserted into the H2O2-reactive (regulatory) domain of the Escherichia coli transcription factor OxyR, specifically HyPer (10Belousov V.V.

Similar to a thiol peroxidase (13Dalla Tiezza M. Bickelhaupt F.M. Flohe L. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Orian L. A dual attack on the peroxide bond. The common principle of peroxidatic cysteine or selenocysteine residues.Redox Biol. 2020; 34: 101540Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the OxyR regulatory domain harbors an active site that catalyzes the reaction between a cysteine residue and H2O2 (14Pedre B.

The resulting disulfide bond leads to a substantial conformational change (15Lee C. Lee S.M. Mukhopadhyay P. Kim S.J. Lee S.C. Ahn W.S. Yu M.H. Storz G. Ryu S.E. Redox regulation of OxyR requires specific disulfide bond formation involving a rapid kinetic reaction path.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which then affects the attached cpYFP domain. E. coli OxyR has been reported to be reducible by glutathione (16Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Activation of the OxyR transcription factor by reversible disulfide bond formation.Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa OxyR has been shown to be reduced by Trx (17Wei Q.

To our knowledge, it has not been clarified how the OxyR domain of HyPer is actually reduced inside cells. A major problem of the conventional HyPer probes is their pronounced pH sensitivity, which is shared by many other probes based on circularly permuted fluorescent proteins, in particular cpYFP (18Ezerina D. Morgan B. Dick T.P. Imaging dynamic redox processes with genetically encoded probes.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2014; 73: 43-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The circular permutation introduces a cleft in the β-barrel that exposes the fluorophore’s pH-sensitive phenoxy group to the ambient environment (19Schwarzlander M. Wagner S. Ermakova Y.G. Belousov V.V. Radi R. Beckman J.S. Buettner G.R. Demaurex N. Duchen M.R. Forman H.J. Fricker M.D. Gems D. Halestrap A.P. Halliwell B. Jakob U. et al.The 'mitoflash' probe cpYFP does not respond to superoxide.Nature. 2014; 514: E12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, to separate the effects of pH and oxidation, it has been expedient to compare HyPer with a redox-insensitive cysteine mutant, which has been named SypHer (20Poburko D. Santo-Domingo J. Demaurex N. Dynamic regulation of the mitochondrial proton gradient during cytosolic calcium elevations.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11672-11684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In fact, SypHer has since been used as a superior pH probe in its own right (21Breckwoldt M.O. Armoundas A.A. Aon M.A. Bendszus M. O'Rourke B. Schwarzlander M. Dick T.P. Kurz F.T. Mitochondrial redox and pH signaling occurs in axonal and synaptic organelle clusters.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 23251Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Most recently, a new member of the HyPer family, HyPer7, has been introduced (22Pak V.V. Ezerina D. Lyublinskaya O.G. Pedre B. Tyurin-Kuzmin P.A. Mishina N.M. Thauvin M. Young D. Wahni K. Martinez Gache S.A. Demidovich A.D. Ermakova Y.G. Maslova Y.D. Shokhina A.G.

HyPer7 differs from earlier HyPer versions in two important ways. First, it uses the more sensitive regulatory OxyR domain from Neisseria meningitidis. Second, it was subjected to both targeted (Y145F) and random mutagenesis (D135N, G298S, and T379P) to select for favorable properties. Overall, it is reported to be brighter, more sensitive to H2O2, and largely pH insensitive when measured in the ratiometric mode (22Pak V.V. Ezerina D. Lyublinskaya O.G. Pedre B. Tyurin-Kuzmin P.A. Mishina N.M. Thauvin M. Young D. Wahni K. Martinez Gache S.A. Demidovich A.D. Ermakova Y.G. Maslova Y.D. Shokhina A.G. Eroglu E. et al.Ultrasensitive genetically encoded indicator for hydrogen peroxide identifies roles for the oxidant in cell migration and mitochondrial function.Cell Metab. 2020; 31: 642-653.e646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a key model eukaryote in redox biology and offers unmatched possibilities for high-throughput genetic screening, we considered it important to test the use of HyPer7 in yeast and compare it to the previously established roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR probe. In short, we find that HyPer7 is well expressed and brighter than previous probes. As previously reported (22Pak V.V. Ezerina D. Lyublinskaya O.G. Pedre B. Tyurin-Kuzmin P.A. Mishina N.M. Thauvin M. Young D. Wahni K. Martinez Gache S.A. Demidovich A.D. Ermakova Y.G. Maslova Y.D. Shokhina A.G. Eroglu E. et al.Ultrasensitive genetically encoded indicator for hydrogen peroxide identifies roles for the oxidant in cell migration and mitochondrial function.Cell Metab. 2020; 31: 642-653.e646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it does not appear to be influenced by pH in the way that confounded the interpretation of conventional HyPer responses. While exhibiting a larger dynamic range, HyPer7 is not as sensitive to H2O2 as the previously described roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR probe. The most striking difference between the two probes is the dynamics of intracellular probe reduction. HyPer7 is reduced faster, predominantly by the Trx system, while roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR is reduced more slowly, by the glutathione system. The more efficient reduction of HyPer7 likely leads to a higher turnover of endogenous H2O2, raising the question if the expression of HyPer7 changes endogenous H2O2 levels and, perhaps, cellular stress resistance and behavior. We conclude that the two probes can be considered complementary in the sense that they provide information on the activity of the two major cellular reducing systems. Future studies using both probes side-by-side may reveal interesting information about the dynamic regulation of the reducing systems. To evaluate the performance of HyPer7 in yeast, and to compare it with roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR, we expressed corresponding codon-optimized coding sequences under control of the TEF promoter. Both probes were expressed at comparable levels, with only minor signs of degradation (Fig. 1A). Both probes exhibited the expected cytosolic distribution, with HyPer7 fluorescing more strongly than roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR (Fig. 1B). Excitation spectra recorded from living cells confirmed that both probes respond to an externally applied bolus of H2O2 in the expected manner (Fig. 1C): Oxidation of roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR (left panel) lowered excitability at 488 nm and increased excitability at 405 nm. In contrast, oxidation of HyPer7 (right panel) increased excitability at 488 nm and decreased excitability at 405 nm. In conclusion, HyPer7 can be expressed in yeast cells in a functional manner. For roGFP2-based probes, it is common practice to ‘calibrate’ measurements by treating cells with high amounts of oxidants and reductants to obtain maximal and minimal fluorescence ratios, corresponding to the fully oxidized and full reduced states, respectively. From these reference values, the probe’s degree of oxidation (OxD) can be calculated (9Meyer A.J. Dick T.P. Fluorescent protein-based redox probes.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 621-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In principle, such reference measurements and OxD calculations should also be applicable to HyPer7. The fully reduced state is usually obtained by DTT treatment, and oxidized HyPer7 can be reduced by externally added DTT (Fig. S1A). However, DTT unexpectedly increased the baseline 488/405 ratio of HyPer7 (Fig. S1B). Given uncertainty about the proper calibration of HyPer7, we decided to abstain from calculating OxD values and only use fluorescence ratios throughout the study. Having confirmed that HyPer7 is expressed and responsive, we performed a titration experiment to determine the minimal amount of exogenous H2O2 that is required to elicit a detectable probe response. In a previous study (4Morgan B. Van Laer K. Owusu T.N. Ezerina D. Pastor-Flores D. Amponsah P.S. Tursch A. Dick T.P. Real-time monitoring of basal H2O2 levels with peroxiredoxin-based probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), 10 μM elicited a response of roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR, while 200 μM was needed to observe a HyPer response. First, we compared the response of both probes to H2O2 concentrations in the range between 100 and 1000 μM (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). Interestingly, the two probes showed markedly different dynamic behaviors. Both probes oxidized quickly, but HyPer7 returned more rapidly to the reduced state. HyPer7 clearly responded to a 100 μM H2O2 bolus, thus confirming its higher sensitivity relative to the original HyPer. As described previously (4Morgan B. Van Laer K. Owusu T.N. Ezerina D. Pastor-Flores D. Amponsah P.S. Tursch A. Dick T.P. Real-time monitoring of basal H2O2 levels with peroxiredoxin-based probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the basal roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR redox state is strongly influenced by changes in oxygen availability, because endogenous H2O2 is generated from oxygen. The continuous lowering of the probe’s baseline ratio reflects ongoing oxygen depletion in the sample. Notably, HyPer7 is not sensitive to the small changes in endogenous peroxide generation related to changes in oxygen pressure. We then compared the response of the two probes to H2O2 bolus concentrations in the range between 1 and 100 μM (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B). The lowest concentration triggering a detectable response was ≈ 5 μM for roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR and ≈ 20 μM for HyPer7. In summary, HyPer7 is more sensitive than the original HyPer but not quite as sensitive as the Prx-based probe. The central problem of previous HyPer probes (HyPer1-3) is their marked pH sensitivity. To deconvolute the influence of H2O2 and pH, we generated and expressed the H2O2-insensitive mutant HyPer7(C121S), which we named SypHer7 in analogy to the original HyPer–SypHer pair of probes (23Demaurex N. Poburko D. Frieden M. Regulation of plasma membrane calcium fluxes by mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Matlashov M.E. Bogdanova Y.A. Ermakova G.V. Mishina N.M. Ermakova Y.G. Nikitin E.S. Balaban P.M. Okabe S. Lukyanov S. Enikolopov G. Zaraisky A.G. Belousov V.V. Fluorescent ratiometric pH indicator SypHer2: Applications in neuroscience and regenerative biology.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1850: 2318-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SypHer7 did not respond to any of the H2O2 concentrations tested (Fig. 3A). Equilibration of probe-expressing yeast cells in different pH buffers (pH 4–9) had a relatively minor influence on the steady-state fluorescence ratio (Fig. 3B). In conclusion, the ratiometric H2O2 response of HyPer7 in yeast does not seem to be confounded by pH effects. The excitation spectrum of SypHer7 was completely unaffected by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3C); however, we also noticed something unexpected: SypHer7 should behave like a fully reduced HyPer7 (as it cannot form the disulfide bond that links the two OxyR half domains) and therefore should never exhibit a higher 488/405 fluorescence ratio than HyPer7, yet its excitation spectrum (and the corresponding ratio) indicated it to be in a (seemingly) more oxidized state than HyPer7 in untreated cells (Fig. 3C). This baseline ratio difference is also evident in Figure 3B. This observation suggests that the C121S mutation not only abolishes redox sensitivity but also influences the protonation state of the cpYFP fluorophore. roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR is known to be predominantly reduced by the glutathione system (4Morgan B. Van Laer K. Owusu T.N. Ezerina D. Pastor-Flores D. Amponsah P.S. Tursch A. Dick T.P. Real-time monitoring of basal H2O2 levels with peroxiredoxin-based probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Having observed pronounced differences in the reduction kinetics of the two probes (Fig. 2, A and B), we wondered which thiol-reducing system is mainly responsible for the reduction of HyPer7 in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae. To this end, we measured probe responses in strains lacking either glutathione reductase (Glr1) or the two cytosolic Trxs (Trx1 and Trx2). In the absence of Glr1, but not in the absence of Trx1/2, the basal redox state of roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR shifted to a higher fluorescence ratio (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the HyPer7 response was only slightly altered in the absence of Glr1 (Fig. 4B, left and middle panel). Instead, it was enhanced and prolonged in the absence of Trx1/2. Moreover, in the absence of Trx1/2, HyPer7 showed a higher basal fluorescence ratio followed by increased reduction over time (Fig. 4B, right panel), suggesting that it has become sensitive to oxygen availability, similar to the Prx-based probe. In conclusion, HyPer7 differs from roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR in that its reduction is mostly dependent on the Trx system. Both HyPer7 and roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR react with and therefore eliminate H2O2 from the cell. As the probes are ectopically expressed at relatively high levels, we asked to which extent probe expression contributes to the cell’s overall capacity to remove H2O2. Previous experiments have shown that roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR makes a negligible contribution to overall peroxidase activity (4Morgan B. Van Laer K. Owusu T.N. Ezerina D. Pastor-Flores D. Amponsah P.S. Tursch A. Dick T.P. Real-time monitoring of basal H2O2 levels with peroxiredoxin-based probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To make a broad assessment also for HyPer7, we asked if probe expression can rescue a growth defect that is caused by the lack of the two endogenous cytosolic Prxs Tsa1 and Tsa2. As expected, ectopic re-expression of WT Tsa2 efficiently rescued growth of a tsa1Δ tsa2Δ strain under H2O2 exposure (Fig. 5). Neither roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR nor HyPer7 rescued to a significant extent, and HyPer7 behaved mostly like SypHer7 (Fig. 5B, right panel). In this study, we investigated the utility of HyPer7 in S. cerevisiae and directly compared it with the previously established roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR probe. We found that HyPer7 is suitable for expression in yeast and highly preferable over earlier HyPer versions in terms of brightness and H2O2 sensitivity. Importantly, ratiometric HyPer7 responses do not seem to be confounded by ambient pH, at least not within the specific context of our experiments. It seems to be an interesting open question which of the mutations specific to HyPer7 renders the probe ratiometrically pH stable and why. Although HyPer7 is much more sensitive than earlier HyPer probes, it is not quite as sensitive as the Prx-based roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR probe. In our bolus response experiments, HyPer7 detected ≈ 20 μM of exogenously added H2O2, whereas roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR detected ≈ 5 μM. It should be noted, as discussed previously (4Morgan B. Van Laer K. Owusu T.N. Ezerina D. Pastor-Flores D. Amponsah P.S. Tursch A. Dick T.P. Real-time monitoring of basal H2O2 levels with peroxiredoxin-based probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Domenech A. Ayte J. Antunes F. Hidalgo E. Using in vivo oxidation status of one- and two-component redox relays to determine H2O2 levels linked to signaling and toxicity.BMC Biol. 2018; 16: 61Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), that these exogenous concentrations translate to endogenous concentrations in the low nanomolar range. The higher sensitivity of the Prx-based probe is also evident in two other ways: First, roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR records the drop in H2O2 steady-state levels that follows the drop in oxygen availability, while HyPer7 is insensitive to these changes. Second, roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR becomes maximally oxidized at bolus concentrations around 750 μM H2O2, while HyPer can resolve boli in a higher concentration range. A clear advantage of HyPer7 over roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR is its larger dynamic range, that is, the fold change in ratio between the fully reduced and fully oxidized states, which is mostly due to the larger intensity change in the 488 nm excitation channel. However, for reasons that remain unclear to us, we found it difficult to reliably “calibrate” HyPer7 inside cells, in particular to determine the exact ratio for the fully reduced state. This is why we decided to present intensity ratios only. It seems that HyPer7 can be slightly modulated by factors unrelated to the thiol-disulfide state of its OxyR domain, and this is potentially also reflected by our observation that SypHer7 shows a higher fluorescence ratio than reduced HyPer7. However, this may not be of practical relevance for most applications. A key finding of this study is that the two probes differ significantly in how they are reduced in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae. Although both probes are oxidized rapidly, HyPer7 is much more quickly reduced than roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR. We found that HyPer7 is predominantly reduced by the Trx system, whereas roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR is predominantly reduced by the glutathione system, as engineered by design (4Morgan B. Van Laer K. Owusu T.N. Ezerina D. Pastor-Flores D. Amponsah P.S. Tursch A. Dick T.P. Real-time monitoring of basal H2O2 levels with peroxiredoxin-based probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The predominant coupling of the two probes to different reducing systems leads to differences in the probe response dynamics (Fig. 2). There is also a difference in how the probes respond to the absence of their respective primary reducing system: For roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR, the main effect is an upward shift of the baseline fluorescence ratio, which is expected because the probe is already sensitive to baseline H2O2 fluctuations in WT cells and hence responds with a substantial upward baseline shift when the predominant reducing system is deleted. Because of the shifted baseline, all bolus-induced changes are compressed into a smaller ratio window, for which resolution is much more limited. In contrast, HyPer7 is not sensitive enough to “see” baseline changes in WT cells, but the deletion of the relevant reducing system makes it sensitive to baseline fluctuations, as evidenced by the appearance of ‘baseline decay’ (caused by ongoing oxygen depletion) in Trx1/2-deficient cells. It is important to recall that both probes, although commonly perceived only as H2O2 probes, are actually reporting on the dynamic interplay between H2O2-dependent thiol oxidation and NADPH-dependent thiol reduction. This means that they are sensitive not only to changes in H2O2 availability but also to changes in thiol-reducing capacity. Hence, the response depends on the interplay between oxidation and reduction kinetics in a given situation and environment, as pointed out earlier (1Schwarzlander M. Dick T.P. Meyer A.J. Morgan B. Dissecting redox biology using fluorescent protein sensors.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2016; 24: 680-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is difficult to say which of the probes is oxidized more rapidly. The observed overall oxidation rate should approximately correspond to the rate of formation of the relevant disulfide bond, that is, the one that alters the fluorescence properties of the attached fluorescent protein. It seems quite likely that the rate of the initial reaction with H2O2 (leading to sulfenic acid formation) is faster for the Prx-based probe than for the OxyR-based probe. However, the Prx probe requires two additional steps (sulfenic acid–thiol condensation followed by thiol–disulfide exchange) to transform the oxidizing equivalent into the roGFP2 disulfide bond. HyPer7 forms the conformation-altering disulfide bond more directly, in one condensation step from the sulfenic acid. Indeed, under the bolus response conditions tested, a major difference in the initial rate of probe oxidation does not seem to exist (Fig. 2). Obviously, in a situation of sudden H2O2 exposure, it is the kinetics of probe reduction that determines if (and how fast) probe oxidation (i.e., accumulation of probes in the disulfide state) can build up to rise above the detection level. An increase of H2O2 concentration will not translate into increased probe oxidation as long as the probe reduction system can keep up; only the flux of oxidizing equivalents through the probe system will increase. The roGFP2-Tsa2ΔCR probe has been deliberately designed to limit reduction by the Trx system: the removal of the resolving cysteine in the Prx domain prevents the formation of Trx-reducible Prx–Prx intersubunit disulfides, and the roGFP2 disulfide bond is not sensitive to reduction by Trx (8Gutscher M. Pauleau A.L. Marty L. Brach T. Wabnitz G.H. Samstag Y. Meyer A.J. Dick T.P. Real-time imaging of the intracellular glutathione redox potential.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), for steric reasons (9Meyer A.J. Dick T.P. Fluorescent protein-based redox probes.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 621-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous experiments have demonstrated that the sensitivity of the roGFP2-Tsa2(wt) fusion protein is limited by the action of the Trx system on the probe (4Morgan B. Van Laer K. Owusu T.N. Ezerina D. Pastor-Flores D. Amponsah P.S. Tursch A. Dick T.P. Real-time monitoring of basal H2O2 levels with peroxiredoxin-based probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the Trx system also limits the sensitivity of HyPer7 because both basal oxidation levels and the H2O2 response are increased in a Trx1/2 KO background (Fig. 4). Thus, it seems that for HyPer7 slow and small changes in H2O2 availability are “ironed out” by fast and efficient reduction. This makes the probe less sensitive but has the potential advantage of allowing for better temporal resolution under conditions of rapidly changing H2O2 levels. Overall, it seems impossible to say which probe is “more a"

Ligands that discriminate between SERT and its close relative, the dopamine transporter DAT, differ in their association rate constant rather than their dissociation rate. The structural basis for this phenomenon is not known. Here we examined the hypothesis that the extracellular loops 2 (EL2) and 4 (EL4) limit access to the ligand-binding site of SERT. We employed an antibody directed against EL4 (residues 388–400) and the antibody fragments 8B6 scFv (directed against EL2 and EL4) and 15B8 Fab (directed against EL2) and analyzed their effects on the transport cycle of and inhibitor binding to SERT. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the EL4 antibody and 8B6 scFv impeded the initial substrate-induced transition from the outward to the inward-facing conformation but not the forward cycling mode of SERT. In contrast, binding of radiolabeled inhibitors to SERT was enhanced by either EL4- or EL2-directed antibodies. We confirmed this observation by determining the association and dissociation rate of the DAT-selective inhibitor methylphenidate via electrophysiological recordings; occupancy of EL2 with 15B8 Fab enhanced the affinity of SERT for methylphenidate by accelerating its binding. Based on these observations, we conclude that (i) EL4 undergoes a major movement during the transition from the outward to the inward-facing state, and (ii) EL2 and EL4 limit access of inhibitors to the binding of SERT, thus acting as a selectivity filter.

This insight has repercussions for drug development. Within the solute carrier-6 family, the closely related monoamine transporters for serotonin (SERT/SLC6A4), dopamine (DAT/SLC6A3), and norepinephrine (NET/SLC6A2) form a separate branch (1Kristensen A.S. Andersen J. Jorgensen T.N. Sorensen L. Eriksen J. Loland C.J. Stromgaard K. Gether U. SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters: Structure, function, and regulation.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63: 585-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Monoamine transporters, and in particular SERT, are arguably the most studied and hence best understood solute carriers (2César-Razquin A. Snijder B. Frappier-Brinton T. Isserlin R. Gyimesi G. Bai X.

In fact, the structure of SERT is known in atomic detail in three conformations, which are visited during the transport cycle, i.e., the outward, the occluded, and the inward-facing state (3Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 4Coleman J.A. Yang D. Zhao Z. Wen P.C.

SERT is a secondary active transporter, which harvests the electrochemical Na+ gradient as a driving force for substrate translocation across the bilayer: it must bind cosubstrate ions, i.e., two sodium and one chloride ion. The kinetics of the transport cycle have been studied in real time, which allowed for defining the rate-limiting step in the conformational transition from the substrate-free inward-facing to outward-facing state (5Schicker K.

SERT is a popular target for both drugs of therapeutic relevance (e.g., antidepressants) and illicit amphetamine-like compounds (8Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Amphetamines, new psychoactive drugs and the monoamine transporter cycle.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2015; 36: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus studies on SERT are not only important to inform drug design and to understand its role in serotonergic neurotransmission and neuromodulation but also to gauge the significance of SERT in drug abuse and in psychiatric disorders. In addition, the insights from these studies also shape concepts of the transport cycle of other secondary active transporters (9Burtscher V. Schicker K. Freissmuth M. Sandtner W. Kinetic models of secondary active transporters.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 205365Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and of diseases caused by mutations in slc6 transporter-encoding genes that affect folding of the expressed protein (10Freissmuth M. Stockner T. Sucic S. SLC6 transporter folding diseases and pharmacochaperoning.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2018; 245: 249-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). SERT harbors two binding sites, a central binding site (S1) and a vestibular binding site (S2 or allosteric site) (11Navratna V. Gouaux E. Insights into the mechanism and pharmacology of neurotransmitter sodium symporters.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 54: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The central binding site (S1) accommodates substrate and cosubstrate ions and inhibitors and lies within the hydrophobic core, which is formed by 12 transmembrane (TM) helices (3Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 12Coleman J.A. Gouaux E.

Chemical and structural investigation of the paroxetine-human serotonin transporter complex.Elife. 2020; 9: 1-38Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The first ten helices are organized as an inverted repeat, where TM1 to TM5 and TM6 to TM10 are arranged in a pseudosymmetric fashion; this tertiary structure is referred to as the LeuT fold (14Yamashita A.

Ed. 2016; 55: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ligand selectivity for SERT versus the closely related DAT is determined by the association rather than the dissociation rate constant (18Hasenhuetl P.S. Schicker K. Koenig X. Li Y. Sarker S.

Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that access to the binding pocket is, at least in part, rate-limiting. SERT has two large extracellular loops, EL2 and EL4, connecting TM3 and TM4 and TM7 and TM8, respectively. EL4 is comprised of two helical portions and has a wedge-like shape. The positions of EL4 differ substantially in the outward and the inward-facing states of LeuT: in the inward-facing state, EL4 shields the substrate-binding site of LeuT (19Krishnamurthy H. Gouaux E. X-ray structures of LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states.Nature. 2012; 481: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The apparent movement of EL4 is more subtle in the inward-facing state of SERT (4Coleman J.A. Yang D. Zhao Z. Wen P.C. Yoshioka C. Tajkhorshid E. Gouaux E. Serotonin transporter–ibogaine complexes illuminate mechanisms of inhibition and transport.Nature. 2019; 569: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, a mutation in EL4 (L406E), which is located in the vicinity of the tip of the wedge, enhances the binding of inhibitors and reduces substrate turnover rate (20Rannversson H. Wilson P. Kristensen K.B. Sinning S. Kristensen A.S. Strømgaard K. Andersen J. Importance of the extracellular loop 4 in the human serotonin transporter for inhibitor binding and substrate translocation.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 14582-14594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a role of EL4 in controlling access to the central binding site. Circumstantial evidence indicates that EL2 is important for substrate translocation rather than for ligand binding (21Smicun Y. Campbell S.D. Chen M.A. Gu H. Rudnick G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36058-36064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the effects of antibody fragments directed against EL2 and EL4 and of an EL4-antibody on the substrate-driven conformational cycle of SERT and examined the hypothesis that EL4 and EL2 limited ligand access to the central binding site. Our observations show that steric hindrance in the movement of EL4—but not of EL2—impeded the initial conformational transition required for substrate translocation. In contrast, occupancy by antibody or Fabs directed against EL2 and EL4 enhanced inhibitor binding to SERT by promoting the association without affecting the dissociation, a finding consistent with a role of EL2 and EL4 in contributing to a selectivity filter in SERT. This conjecture was reinforced by using the DAT-selective inhibitor methylphenidate. The transport cycle of SERT can be studied by electrophysiological recordings. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) transport induces a current through SERT with two components, a peak component followed by a steady-state component (Fig. 1, A and B). The peak component corresponds to the initial conformational change on SERT, induced by the binding and translocation of the substrate and cosubstrates. It is inwardly directed due to the movement of net positive charges (Na+ and the ionized substrate) through the membrane electric field (5Schicker K. Uzelac Z. Gesmonde J. Bulling S. Stockner T. Freissmuth M. Boehm S. Rudnick G. Sitte H.H. Sandtner W. Unifying concept of serotonin transporter-associated currents.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 438-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as SERT undergoes conformational changes from outward-open to occluded and inward-open states upon substrate binding and release (4Coleman J.A. Yang D. Zhao Z. Wen P.C. Yoshioka C. Tajkhorshid E. Gouaux E. Serotonin transporter–ibogaine complexes illuminate mechanisms of inhibition and transport.Nature. 2019; 569: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SERT releases substrate in the inward-open state, and K+ is bound to the transporter during the return step to complete the transport cycle. This cycle continues as long as the substrate is applied from the extracellular side. The cycling of the transporter creates a Na+ conductance, which gives rise to the second current component, i.e., the steady-state current (5Schicker K. Uzelac Z. Gesmonde J. Bulling S. Stockner T. Freissmuth M. Boehm S. Rudnick G. Sitte H.H. Sandtner W. Unifying concept of serotonin transporter-associated currents.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 438-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 15B8 Fab and 8B6 scFv are directed against an epitope in extracellular loop 2 (EL2) and epitopes in EL2 and EL4, respectively (3Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 4Coleman J.A. Yang D. Zhao Z. Wen P.C. Yoshioka C. Tajkhorshid E. Gouaux E. Serotonin transporter–ibogaine complexes illuminate mechanisms of inhibition and transport.Nature. 2019; 569: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that binding of both 8B6 scFv and 15B8 Fab to SERT completely blocked substrate uptake; in contrast, binding of 15B8 Fab alone did not inhibit substrate translocation (4Coleman J.A. Yang D. Zhao Z. Wen P.C. Yoshioka C. Tajkhorshid E. Gouaux E. Serotonin transporter–ibogaine complexes illuminate mechanisms of inhibition and transport.Nature. 2019; 569: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of these two antibody fragments on the transport cycle in real time by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The experimental protocol (see schematic representation in Fig. 1, A and B) relied on the application of 30 μM 5-HT for 5 s to elicit a reference current. This was followed by a washout for 20 s, which allowed for the decay of the current to baseline. Subsequently, the cell was superfused with a saturating concentration (300 nM) of 8B6 scFv (Fig. 1A) or of 15B8 Fab (Fig. 1B) to allow for binding of the antibodies to SERT. When 8B6 scFv-bound SERT was challenged by reapplication of the substrate, the peak current was reduced by about 50%, but the steady-state current was not altered (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast, in the 15B8 Fab-bound complex, neither the peak nor the steady-state currents were affected (Fig. 1, B and D). Because 15B8 Fab did not elicit any change in the substrate-induced currents, we used an independent approach to verify that 15B8 Fab could bind to the transporter under the conditions employed in our electrophysiological recordings: we relied on the observation that binding of a charged molecule to the membrane or to a membrane protein neutralizes surface charge and can be measured by following the change in membrane capacitance (22Burtscher V. Hotka M. Li Y. Freissmuth M. Sandtner W. A label-free approach to detect ligand binding to cell surface proteins in real time.Elife. 2018; 7: 1-21Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing SERT were superfused with 15B8 Fab (300 nM) or—as a control—8B6 scFv (300 nM) and the changes in membrane capacitance were recorded. Both 8B6 scFv (Fig. 1E) and 15B8 Fab (Fig. 1F) caused a drop in membrane capacitance (by about 400 fF and 600 fF, respectively), which was reversed upon removal of the antibody fragments. We therefore conclude that 15B8 Fab can bind to SERT but does not affect the substrate-induced current. Next, we determined the concentration-dependent inhibition of the 5-HT-induced peak current by 8B6 scFv. As shown in Figure 2A, the peak current amplitude progressively decreased with increasing concentrations of 8B6 scFv. We normalized the peak current recorded after superfusion with 8B6 scFv to the reference peak current elicited prior to application of 8B6 scFv in order to account for intercell differences and plotted these normalized current amplitudes as a function of 8B6 scFv concentration. This resulted in a monophasic inhibition curve with a plateau at about 50%; half-maximum inhibition was seen at 27.9 ± 7.3 nM (mean ± SD). We also independently estimated the affinity of 8B6 scFv by recording the concentration-dependent reduction in membrane capacitance (ΔCm). Variations in cell size and hence in membrane capacitance were accounted for by normalizing ΔCm to the maximum drop in membrane capacitance (ΔCmmax). The relation of 8B6 scFv concentration to the change in membrane capacitance (ΔCm/ΔCmmax) was adequately described by a rectangular hyperbola, yielding an EC50 estimate of 15.7 ± 5.1 nM (mean ± SD). Taken together, these observations indicate that 8B6 scFv—but not 15B8 Fab—impedes the conformational change of SERT, which is triggered by the binding of serotonin. However, once serotonin has induced transport, the transporter may be relieved from the inhibitory action of 8B6 scFv, allowing it to cycle effectively through its conformational transitions to support the steady-state current. In contrast, sole occupancy of EL2 by 15B8 Fab neither impedes entry into nor progression through the transport cycle. Because 8B6 scFv binds to both EL2 and EL4 (3Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), it was not clear if its action was due to binding to EL2, to EL4, or the combination of both. Accordingly, we used an affinity-purified antibody raised against residues 388–400 of SERT, i.e., targeting the same region of EL4 recognized by 8B6 scFv (3Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The antibody was tested in a protocol identical to that employed for the 15B8 Fab and 8B6 scFv. When cells were superfused with concentrations of the antiSERT-EL4 ranging from 1 to 30 nM prior to 5-HT application, we observed a concentration-dependent reduction in the peak current elicited by 5-HT (Fig. 3A). A plot of the peak currents, normalized to the amplitudes of the reference current, against the concentration of the antiSERT-EL4 antibody again resulted in a monophasic inhibition curve. Nonlinear regression gave an IC50 estimate of 2.2 ± 0.4 nM (mean ± SD) for the antiSERT-EL4 antibody (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that it is the occupation of EL4 that impedes the initial substrate-induced conformational changes in SERT. We designed a time-course protocol to estimate the binding kinetics of 8B6 scFv and antiSERT-EL4 antibody. SERT-expressing cells attached to the recording pipet were exposed to 8B6 scFv (1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 s, cf. Fig. 4A) or antiSERT-EL4 antibody (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 s, cf. Fig. 4B). A time-dependent decrease in the peak current amplitude was observed for both the 8B6 scFv (Fig. 4A) and the antiSERT-EL4 antibody (Fig. 4B). For each concentration employed (i.e., 30, 100, 200, and 300 nM 8B6 scFv or 1, 3, 10, and 20 nM antiSERT-EL4), the amplitudes of the peak currents were normalized to the preceding reference current and the normalized peak currents were plotted against exposure time. The resulting curves were fit by a monoexponential decay, which allowed for extracting the apparent association rate (kapp) for each concentration of 8B6 scFv (Fig. 4C) and antiSERT-EL4 (Fig. 4D). As expected for a bimolecular reaction, the time-dependent reduction in peak current amplitude was accelerated with increasing 8B6 scFv or antiSERT-EL4 concentrations. The calculated values for kapp were (means ± SD) 0.22 ± 0.05 s−1, 0.40 ± 0.07 s−1, 0.67 ± 0.13 s−1, and 0.72 ± 0.12 s−1 for 30, 100, 200, and 300 nM 8B6 scFv, respectively, and 1.19 ± 0.30 s−1, 1.36 ± 0.26 s−1, 1.80 ± 0.32 s−1, and 2.16 ± 0.21 s−1 for 1, 3, 10, and 20 nM antiSERT-EL4 antibody, respectively. A plot of kapp values for 8B6 scFv or antiSERT-EL4 versus concentration yielded straight lines, with the slopes and the y-intercepts of these straight lines corresponding to the association rate constants (kon) and the dissociation rates (koff), respectively. Thus, the kon values for 8B6 scFv and antiSERT-EL4 (mean ± SD) were 1.93 ± 0.36 × 106 M−1 s−1 and 5.05 ± 0.61 × 107 M−1 s−1, and the koff values were 0.20 ± 0.07 s−1 and 1.20 ± 0.07 s−1, respectively. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for both the Fab and the antibody, calculated using the kinetic rate constants (koff/kon), were 103 nM and 23.8 nM, respectively. These kinetic KD values for the 8B6 scFv and antiSERT-EL4 are not in line with their IC50 (25.3 and 4.2 nM) derived from the concentration–response curves summarized in Figures 2B and 3B. The actions of 8B6 scFv and antiSERT-EL4 antibody—i.e., inhibition of the peak current in the absence of any appreciable effect on the steady-state current (Figs. 1, A and B, 2A and 3A)—are most readily accounted for by assuming that 8B6 scFv and antiSERT-EL4 antibody dissociate rapidly upon substrate binding to SERT. Thus, substrate binding to the 8B6 scFv or antiSERT-EL4 antibody-bound state of SERT promotes dissociation of the antibody (fragment) by forcing a conformation-dependent removal. Therefore, the calculated koff and the KD are a combination of antibody dissociation due to reversible binding and due to 5-HT-induced antibody release. We inferred that the discrepancy between IC50 and KD values resulted from substrate-induced rapid dissociation of the 8B6 scFv and the EL4-directed antibody. We verified this assumption by developing a kinetic model for the transport cycle of SERT in the presence of the 8B6 scFv based on the kinetic rate constants calculated from the time-course experiments (Fig. 5A). The principles underlying this kinetic modeling have been described elsewhere (9Burtscher V. Schicker K. Freissmuth M. Sandtner W. Kinetic models of secondary active transporters.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 205365Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our model posited that the 8B6 scFv bound in a conformation-dependent manner by favoring the outward-facing conformation of SERT in its apo-state: the dissociation of 8B6 scFv from SERT was predicted to be 100 times faster in the presence of 5-HT (factor ""A"" in Fig. 5A). This prediction was in line with the approximately fivefold difference between the IC50 and KD in our experimental data, supporting our hypothesis of substrate-induced rapid dissociation of antibody. We carried out simulations using our model to confirm its validity based on our experimental data. In Figure 5B, the peak current protocol used in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 was applied to our modeled transporter in silico to examine the effect of 8B6 scFv on the peak current. The resulting synthetic traces (left panel in Fig. 5B) recapitulated the experimental data (right panel in Fig. 5B). We simulated experiments, which examined the reduction in peak current by 8B6 scFv over the same concentration range as in Figure 2B, i.e., from 30 to 300 nM. The size of the peak currents was extracted from these in silico experiments, normalized to the peak current simulated in the absence of the antibody fragment, and plotted against the 8B6 scFv concentration (Fig. 5C). Our simulated modeling predicted an IC50 of 32.9 nM, thus the resulting inhibition curve (solid line) recapitulated the experimental data summarized in Figure 2B (its position is indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 5C). We also interrogated the kinetic model to simulate the time-dependent inhibition of the peak current by increasing concentrations of 8B6 scFv. Figure 5D illustrates a representative synthetic experiment, which mirrored the experimental results found in Figure 4A: it is evident that the peak current declined with a monophasic exponential decay as the preincubation with 300 nM 8B6 scFv was increased. Similar synthetic experiments were done for 30, 100, and 200 nM 8B6 scFv, and the time course of peak current inhibition was compared with that observed in the actual experiments: the in silico data (Fig. 5E) recapitulated the experimental findings with reasonable fidelity (taken from Fig. 4C and shown as dashed lines in Fig. 5E). A curve of monoexponential decay was fitted to the synthetic data for each 8B6 scFv concentration to extract the apparent on-rate kapp (Fig. 5E, solid lines). The calculated kapp values of the in silico data were 0.08 s−1, 0.21 s−1, 0.35 s−1, and 0.62 s−1 for 30, 100, 200, and 300 nM 8B6 scFv, respectively. A plot of the kapp values of the in silico data over the corresponding 8B6 scFv concentrations yielded a straight line (solid line in Fig. 5F). For comparison, the linear regression to the experimental data (taken from Fig. 4E) and the 95% confidence interval are also shown in Figure 5F as dashed lines. We derived kon (2.17 × 106 M−1 s−1) and koff (0.07 s−1) for 8B6 scFv from the simulated data. The bimolecular association rate constant kon (1.93 × 106 M−1 s−1) estimated from the actual experiments is in line with the kon determined from the simulation. In contrast, there is a discrepancy between the koff-values estimated from the experimental data (0.20 s−1) and the koff extracted from the simulation, which is due to the low precision in estimating the y-intercept (cf. 95% confidence interval in Fig. 5F). Finally, we examined the ability of 8B6 scFv to bind to SERT under steady state-conditions during the transport cycle (left panel in Fig. 5G): a hypothetical cell expressing SERT was superfused with 5-HT for 25 s. Following an interval of 5 s, after we recorded the reference peak and the steady-state components, 8B6 scFv was coapplied with the substrate for 10 s to observe its effect on the steady-state current. Then, 8B6 scFv was washed out by buffer containing only the substrate for 10 s, allowing for return to the reference steady-state component. At last, the substrate was also removed by washing with buffer until the signal reached the baseline. The model generated a synthetic current trace, where 8B6 scFv (300 nM) only caused a very small inhibition of the steady-state current. This is consistent with the fact that the binding of 8B6 scFv to SERT is not favored in the presence of the substrate. More importantly, we also carried out actual experiments to verify the prediction of the model. It is evident from the representative trace shown in the right panel of Figure 5G that the experimental observations matched the in silico data closely: we observed only a very modest inhibition of the steady-state current by 8B6 scFv (300 nM). The combined application of 8B6 scFv and 15B8 Fab (each at 1 μM) was previously shown to fully block substrate uptake by SERT (3Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We verified that this inhibition was recapitulated in electrophysiological recordings: the representative trace in Figure 5H shows that in a cell, which was superfused with 15B8 Fab, addition of 8B6 scFv resulted in a pronounced suppression of the steady-state current. This inhibition was promptly reversed by washout of 8B6 scFv. On average the combination of 15B8 Fab and 8B6 scFv (each at 300 nM) suppressed the current by about 90% (Fig. 5I). We independently confirmed by capacitance recordings that both antibodies were bound simultaneously (Fig. 5J). Taken together, the experimental and in silico kinetics show that 8B6 scFv and the antiSERT-EL4 antibodies bind to the outward-facing conformation of SERT. EL4 of L"

We used cysteine-specific isotopic coded affinity tags (OxICAT) and gel-free mass spectrometry analysis to investigate the cysteine Ox-PTMs profile in the proteome of both plantaris (glycolytic) and soleus (oxidative) muscles in tumor-bearing and control rats. Histological analysis revealed muscle atrophy in type II fibers in plantaris muscle, with no changes in plantaris type I fibers and no differences in both soleus type I and II fibers in tumor-bearing rats when compared to healthy controls. Tumor progression altered the Ox-PTMs profile in both plantaris and soleus. However, pathway analysis including the differentially oxidized proteins revealed tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation as main affected pathways in plantaris muscle from tumor-bearing rats, while the same analysis did not show main metabolic pathways affected in the soleus muscle. In addition, cancer progression affected several metabolic parameters such as ATP levels and markers of oxidative stress associated with muscle atrophy in plantaris muscle, but not in soleus. However, isolated soleus from tumor-bearing rats had a reduced force production capacity when compared to controls. These novel findings demonstrate that tumor-bearing rats have severe muscle atrophy exclusively in glycolytic fibers. Cancer progression is associated with cysteine Ox-PTMs in the skeletal muscle, but these modifications affect different pathways in a glycolytic muscle compared to an oxidative muscle, indicating that intrinsic muscle oxidative capacity determines the response to cancer cachectic effects."

However, the molecular events that drive energy imbalances in ALS are not completely understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate deficits in energy homeostasis in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. SOD1G93A mice and their wild-type littermates underwent indirect calorimetry and intraperitoneal glucose/insulin tolerance tests at both the onset and mid-symptomatic stages of the disease. Glucose uptake and the plasma glucoregulatory hormone profiles were analyzed. Pancreatic islet cell mass and function were assessed by measuring hormone concentrations and secretion in isolated islets, and pancreatic α- and β-cell immunoreactive areas. Finally, we profiled liver glycogen metabolism by measuring glucagon concentrations and liver metabolic gene expressions. We identified that mid-symptomatic SOD1G93A mice have increased oxygen consumption and faster exogenous glucose uptake, despite presenting with normal insulin tolerance. The capacity for pancreatic islets to secrete insulin appears intact, however, islet cell insulin concentrations and β-cell mass were reduced. Fasting glucose homeostasis was also disturbed, along with increased liver glycogen stores, despite elevated circulating glucagon, suggesting that glucagon signaling is impaired. Metabolic gene expression profiling of livers indicated that glucose cannot be utilized efficiently in SOD1G93A mice. Overall, we demonstrate that glucose homeostasis and uptake are altered in SOD1G93A mice, which is linked to an increase in insulin-independent glucose uptake, and a loss of β-cells, insulin production, and glucagon sensitivity. This suggests that the hormonal regulation of glucose concentrations may contribute to the progression of disease in this ALS mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W3167702663,"In the current study, we sought to determine the roles of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) on the promotion of intestinal sepsis in a mouse model. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to determine the binding relationship between HDAC5 and Ghrelin. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used as an animal model of intestinal sepsis. The roles of HDAC5 on intestinal sepsis were determined by HDAC5 knockdown, overexpression, and inhibitor (LMK-235) in vivo. Mice intestinal permeability and intestinal epithelial damage were evaluated, and HE staining was used to evaluate the intestinal mucosal injury index. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated intestinal-derived macrophages served as a cell model of sepsis, followed by the loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays. ELISA was used to determine the levels of inflammatory factors, and TUNEL staining was used to detect intestinal cell apoptosis. HDAC5 was upregulated in the intestine of sepsis patients. This increased HDAC5 expression was positively correlated with the expression of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and HMGB1, as well as the intestinal dysfunction-related factors IFABP. In sepsis mice, the expression of inflammatory factors was reduced by HDAC5 knockdown. HDAC5 knockdown also improved survival, morphology of intestinal tissue, intestinal permeability, and epithelial damage. Ghrelin was bound and inhibited by HDAC5, but E2F1 expression was increased by Ghrelin overexpression, leading to inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Ghrelin and E2F1 expression were increased by the treatment with HDAC5 inhibitor LMK-235, which inhibited the NF-κB pathway to improve intestinal dysfunction in the sepsis model. In conclusion, HDAC5 inhibits Ghrelin to reduce E2F1 and thus activate the NF-κB pathway, thereby promoting intestinal sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W3161801995,"Background Informed consent (IC) is a healthcare standard emphasizing the meaning of human dignity as clarified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Data about IC practices in Egypt is insufficient. This study aimed to assess the Egyptian patients’/guardians’ experiences about IC and their expectations about its practices’ purposes in general and according to the type of the healthcare facility. Methods Self-administered questionnaire was carried out for 1092 participants who had undergone or were scheduled to a procedure requiring an IC at three studied types for Egyptian health care facilities. Ten statements were ranked twice by the participants to reflect their perception of IC purpose as per what is currently practiced and what they believe should be practiced. Results IC implementation varies significantly (p&lt;0.05) across the health care facilities in Egypt. The percentage of its implementation at the non-governmental facilities, governmental facilities, and university hospital was 85.9%, 77.8%, and 63.8 respectively. The first three ranked purposes of the current IC practices were: “Helping patient/guardian decide (64.9%)”, “Documenting patient’s/guardian’s decision (59.3%)”, and “Having shared decision (57.3%)”. The perceived purposes of IC to be practiced were: “Informing the patient/guardian (68.4%)”, “Making sure patient/guardian understand (65.3%)” and “Documenting patients/guardians decisions (65.1%)”. “Being a meaningless routine” was reported by the majority to be ranked as a low purpose for IC current and preferred practices. Conclusion The practice of IC is common within the Egyptian medical community. Participants believe that information disclosure “Making sure patients understand” has to help in IC decision making and its main purpose. However, unfortunately, this is not perceived as a current purpose of IC. There was consensus agreement that documenting the patient’s/guardian’s decision and informing the patient/guardian are perceived as both important current and preferred purposes for IC practices."

To elude these defense mechanisms, ticks secrete multiple anticoagulant proteins and complement system inhibitors in their saliva. Here, we characterized the inhibitory activities of the homologous tick salivary proteins tick salivary lectin pathway inhibitor, Salp14, and Salp9Pac from Ixodes scapularis in the coagulation cascade and the lectin complement pathway. All three proteins inhibited binding of mannan-binding lectin to the polysaccharide mannan, preventing the activation of the lectin complement pathway. In contrast, only Salp14 showed an appreciable effect on coagulation by prolonging the lag time of thrombin generation. We found that the anticoagulant properties of Salp14 are governed by its basic tail region, which resembles the C terminus of tissue factor pathway inhibitor alpha and blocks the assembly and/or activity of the prothrombinase complex in the same way. Moreover, the Salp14 protein tail contributes to the inhibition of the lectin complement pathway via interaction with mannan binding lectin–associated serine proteases. Furthermore, we identified BaSO4-adsorbing protein 1 isolated from the tick Ornithodoros savignyi as a distant homolog of tick salivary lectin pathway inhibitor/Salp14 proteins and showed that it inhibits the lectin complement pathway but not coagulation. The structure of BaSO4-adsorbing protein 1, solved here using NMR spectroscopy, indicated that this protein adopts a noncanonical epidermal growth factor domain–like structural fold, the first such report for tick salivary proteins.

Ticks (Ixodida) are blood-sucking ectoparasites counting circa 900 species, which are widely distributed across the globe (1Horak I.G. Camicas J.-L. Keirans J.E. The argasidae, ixodidae and nuttalliellidae (Acari: Ixodida): A world list of valid tick names.Exp. Appl. Acarol. 2002; 28: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). They present a threat for animal husbandry and humans, transmitting more than a dozen of serious diseases, such as Lyme disease, typhus, and tick-borne meningoencephalitis (2Dantas-Torres F. Chomel B.B. Otranto D. Ticks and tick-borne diseases: A one health perspective.Trends Parasitol. 2012; 28: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Although ticks predominantly populate areas with warm and humid climate, their geographic range limit is expanding because of climate change, which will most likely dramatically increase pressures on public health and economy in the future (3Ogden N.H.

In that light, scientific research on ticks and their biomolecular adaptive mechanisms would be beneficial for the development of potential vaccines and therapeutics. One of the crucial adaptations to the parasitic way of life that ticks acquired during evolution is an enormous arsenal of bioactive compounds in their saliva (4Kazimírová M. Štibrániová I.

The latter attract particular attention as the tick salivary lectin pathway inhibitor (TSLPI) of Ixodes scapularis has been shown to not only inhibit the lectin complement pathway but also facilitate the transmission of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi (9Schuijt T.J.

Rep. 2018; 8: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) share 81% and 83% sequence identity with TSLPI. Taking into account that the coagulation cascade and complement system are evolutionary deeply interconnected (12Dzik S. Complement and coagulation: Cross talk through time.Transfus. Med. Rev. 2019; 33: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we were intrigued by the possibility that proteins from the TSLPI/Salp14 family may target both systems. In the present work, we have identified a distant homolog of the TSLPI/Salp14 proteins—BaSO4-adsorbing protein 1 (BSAP1) isolated from Ornithodoros savignyi. Furthermore, we have studied the activity of selected TSLPI/Salp14 proteins and BSAP1 in the complement system and coagulation cascade. Although all proteins act as lectin pathway inhibitors, those with a lysine-rich C terminus in addition possess anticoagulant activity similar to the human natural anticoagulant tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor alpha (TFPIα) C terminus. Moreover, structure elucidation of BSAP1 using NMR spectroscopy showed that the protein core region adopts a noncanonical epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like domain fold, which is a novel motif for tick salivary proteins. To date, the following characterized proteins could be assigned to the TSLPI/Salp14 family: TSLPI (Uniprot accession code: U5LJX2), Salp14 (Uniprot accession code: Q95WY7), Salp9Pac (Uniprot accession code: Q8MUP7), Ixonnexin (Uniprot accession code: Q4PMS3) from I. scapularis, and TSLPI (Uniprot accession code: F6KSY1) from I. ricinus (5Assumpção T.C.

Whereas these proteins share the highly conserved N-terminal region, with sequence identity varying from 82 to 94%, their C-terminal region shows no clear consensus. Salp14 and Ixonnexin have long positively charged C termini rich in polylysine stretches, whereas Salp9pac embodies a short negatively charged C-terminal region, and both TSLPI variants lack an extended C terminus (Fig. 1A). Alongside with these proteins, homology search resulted in several dozens of uncharacterized sequences deposited in the protein bank as part of tick salivary gland transcriptomes. Although further homology search using the Blastp algorithm yielded no characterized homologs, we hypothesized that BSAP1 isolated from the tick O. savignyi (14Ehebauer M. Mans B. Gaspar A.R. Neitz A.W. Identification of extrinsic blood coagulation pathway inhibitors from the tick Ornithodoros savignyi (Acari: Argasidae).Exp. Parasitol. 2002; 101: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) could be a member of the TSLPI/Salp14 family. Full-length BSAP1 is composed of 86 amino acids including six cysteine residues (15Denisov S.S. Ippel J.H. Mans B.J. Dijkgraaf I. Hackeng T.M. SecScan: A general approach for mapping disulfide bonds in synthetic and recombinant peptides and proteins.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2019; 55: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and showed relatively low sequence identity ranging from 23 to 33% with Salp14 and TSLPI (I. ricinus), respectively. However, it shares a similar pattern of cysteine residues and multiple fully conserved residues among all selected proteins (P12, A13, Y20, Y21, W29, F33, N35, G36, Y41, N42, G47, G52, and S60). The C-terminal region of BSAP1 is composed predominantly of charged residues and has no homology with other TSLPI/Salp14 proteins. Considering that BSAP1 is found in soft ticks, whereas the other proteins are from hard ticks, BSAP1 could be a distant homolog of the Salp14/TSLPI protein family. To test this hypothesis, BSAP1 and I. scapularis proteins, TSLPI, Salp14, and Salp9Pac, were expressed in Escherichia coli for further study (Table S1). All expressed proteins were obtained with a retained N-terminal methionine and then refolded under oxidative conditions (Fig. S1). Oxidative refolding resulted in a 6 Da decrease of molecular mass, indicating the formation of three disulfide bonds. Purification of refolded proteins using HPLC yielded ∼2 to 6 mg of protein per 1 l of bacterial culture. The effect of tick proteins on blood coagulation was assessed by following thrombin generation in normal human plasma triggered with 2 pM TF in the absence and presence of 10 μM tick proteins. In the absence of tick proteins, thrombin generation had a lag time of 9.8 ± 0.5 min and a peak height of 35.9 ± 0.9 nM in normal pooled human plasma (Fig. 1B). None of the tick proteins affected the peak height of thrombin generation. BSAP1 and Salp9Pac also did not significantly affect the lag time (10.3 ± 0.1 and 9.8 ± 0.1 min, respectively), whereas addition of TSLPI caused a slight prolongation to 11.3 ± 0.1 min (Fig. 1B). Salp14 showed the most pronounced anticoagulant activity, increasing the lag time up to 12.8 ± 0.3 min, without affecting the peak height (35.5 ± 1.4 nM). As Salp14 is the only protein among the ones tested that embodies a positively charged C terminus, one could hypothesize that this region and not the protein core is the source of anticoagulant activity. To test this hypothesis, the D70-L104 region of Salp14 was synthesized using Boc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) (Fig. S2 and Table S2) and tested in the thrombin generation assay. Addition of D70-L104 Salp14 resulted in prolongation of the lag time up to 14.0 ± 0.1 min, which is comparable with the effect of the full-length protein (Fig. 1C). To shed light on the molecular mechanism of the anticoagulant activity of D70-L104 Salp14, its influence on individual enzymes participating in thrombin generation was studied. The ability to prolong the lag time of thrombin generation indicated inhibition of the initiation phase, in which the TF/factor VIIa (FVIIa) complex activates FX, which in turn activates factor V (FV) leading to the formation of the prothrombinase (FXa/FVa) complex. Chromogenic assays were used to study potential inhibition of TF/FVIIa and FXa activity. D70-L104 Salp14 up to a concentration of 20 μM had no effect on TF/FVIIa or FXa amidolytic activities (Fig. 2A), thereby failing to provide an explanation for the prolongation of the lag time of thrombin generation by this peptide. Moreover, as BSAP1 was initially described as an extrinsic pathway inhibitor (14Ehebauer M. Mans B. Gaspar A.R. Neitz A.W. Identification of extrinsic blood coagulation pathway inhibitors from the tick Ornithodoros savignyi (Acari: Argasidae).Exp. Parasitol. 2002; 101: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it was titrated in TF/FVIIa and FXa chromogenic assays as well, but similar to D70-L104 Salp14, no inhibitory activity was observed (Fig. 2B). It has been demonstrated that the basic region of the TFPIα C terminus can bind to the exposed acidic region of FV (16Wood J.P. Bunce M.W. Maroney S.A. Tracy P.B. Camire R.M. Mast A.E.

A. 2013; 110: 17838-17843Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we hypothesized that the positively charged region of D70-L104 Salp14 could act in the same manner as the TFPIα C terminus and tested this hypothesis using an assay previously developed to probe the susceptibility of FV activation/activity to inhibition by the TFPIα C terminus (18Van Doorn P. Rosing J. Campello E. Middeldorp S. Simioni P. Meijers J.C.M. Hackeng T.M. Castoldi E. Development of a plasma-based assay to measure the susceptibility of factor v to inhibition by the C-terminus of TFPIα.Thromb. Haemost. 2020; 120: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Addition of 100 nM D70-L104 Salp14 caused a 40% decrease in prothrombinase activity compared with the no-peptide reference (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that D70-L104 Salp14 indeed interferes with FV activation and/or early prothrombinase activity. To further elucidate the role of these basic residues, two novel peptides based on D70-L104 Salp14 were designed. In the first peptide, all six lysines in the designated 89TKKPKRKSKK98 region were acetylated to remove their positive charges, whereas in the second one, four residues were mutated to obtain the TFPIα-like sequence 89LIKTKRKRKK98. Peptides were produced with Boc-based SPPS and named D70-L104 acSalp14 and D70-L104 Salp14/TFPI, respectively (Table S2 and Fig. S2). When tested in the FV inhibition assay, 100 nM of D70-L104 Salp14/TFPI was a more potent inhibitor compared with D70-L104 Salp14, resulting in ∼30% residual prothrombinase activity. This value is comparable with the effect caused by addition of 100 nM TFPIα C terminus (Fig. 3, B and C). The acetylated variant D70-L104 acSalp14 was the least active, decreasing prothrombinase activity to ∼70% of the value observed in the absence of an inhibitor. To assess the relevance of the basic region of D70-L104 Salp14 for anticoagulant activity, its three variants alongside with the TFPIα C terminus were also tested in the thrombin generation assay (Fig. 3D). D70-L104 acSalp14 showed no significant influence on the lag time and peak height compared with the native sequence. In contrast, titration of D70-L104 Salp14/TFPI and the TFPIα C terminus effectively prolonged lag time and decreased the peak height of thrombin generation curves in a dose-dependent manner. The lectin pathway of the complement system is initiated by binding of pattern recognition proteins such as mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins to certain carbohydrates. MBL and ficolins circulate in blood in complex with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which upon binding to carbohydrate convert complement proteins C4 and C2, further unfolding the lectin pathway (19Garred P. Genster N. Pilely K. Bayarri-Olmos R. Rosbjerg A. Ma Y.J. Skjoedt M.O. A journey through the lectin pathway of complement—MBL and beyond.Immunol. Rev. 2016; 274: 74-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As TSLPI is a known inhibitor of the lectin pathway, TSLPI/Salp14 proteins were tested in a lectin pathway activation ELISA assay using mannan activation and an anti-C4b antibody as readout. TSLPI blocked lectin pathway activation in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value around ∼25 μM (Fig. 4A). BSAP1 had a higher inhibitory activity with EC50 values of ∼8 μM, similarly to Salp14 and Salp9 (Fig. S3). As BSAP1 is a novel complement inhibitor, its influence on activation of the classical and alternative pathway has been assessed as well. BSAP1 at a concentration of 100 μM effectively inhibited activation of the classical pathway but had little effect on the alternative pathway (Fig. S4). Surprisingly, D70-L104 Salp14 alone also effectively inhibited lectin pathway activation with an EC50 value of ∼17 μM. However, when a similar assay was performed using an anti-MBL antibody as readout, D70-L104 Salp14 had no effect on lectin pathway activation, whereas TSLPI and BSAP1 remained active with EC50 values of ∼90 and ∼26 μM, respectively (Fig. 4B). To assess the influence of D70-L104 Salp14 on MASPs, the amidolytic activity of MBL-bound MASP1 in the absence and presence of D70-L104 Salp14 was studied. To this end, active MBL–MASP complexes were captured from human serum using mannan-coated wells, and the amidolytic activity of MASP1 was assessed using a fluorogenic substrate. When serum was incubated in mannan-coated wells, the observed slope of the fluorescence signal was 1.2 ± 0.3 fluorescence units/min, whereas in the absence of mannan coating, no significant fluorescence signal was detected (Fig. 4C). Addition of 100 μM D70-L104 Salp14 to mannan-bound MBL–MASP complexes resulted in a slope of 1.1 ± 0.1 fluorescence units/min, which is comparable with control experiments in the absence of the peptide. To investigate a possible structure–activity relationship of TSLPI/Salp14 proteins, we attempted structure elucidation of TSLPI, BSAP1, and D70-L104 Salp14 using solution NMR spectroscopy. Although D70-L104 Salp14 embodies multiple lysines in virtually similar environments, all signals were unambiguously assigned using a series of 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and 2D decoupling in the presence of scalar interactions/NOESY spectra at different temperatures to remove severe signal overlap (Fig. S5). Nevertheless, the narrow chemical shift dispersion and the lack of long-range NOE signals indicated that the D70-L104 Salp14 C terminus adopts an unstructured random coil–like state. To allow profound structural analysis of TSLPI and BSAP1, both proteins were uniformly metabolically enriched with 15N and 13C and studied by 2D and 3D NMR spectroscopy. In the 15N HSQC spectrum of TSLPI, the vast majority of amide peaks showed severe resonance broadening, and a mere ∼30% of residues could be assigned (Fig. S6), irrespective of screening optimal conditions for spectra recording. This severely limited a detailed structure elucidation. In contrast, the 15N HSQC spectrum of BSAP1 showed nearly all amide signals with exceptions of D1, N42, A43, K45, and D46 (Fig. S7). 15N NOE relaxation data indicated that the structured region of the protein includes residues within a cysteine framework and spans roughly from S2 to S60 residues, whereas the C terminus remains flexible (Fig. 5A). Analysis of the 2D 15N NOESY spectrum yielded ∼1100 assigned NOE signals, of which 986 belonged to the D1-S60 region. Combined with TALOS-predicted dihedral angles and the previously determined disulfide bond network (C6–C22, C18–C49, and C39–C54) (15Denisov S.S. Ippel J.H. Mans B.J. Dijkgraaf I. Hackeng T.M.

Open table in a new tab All values are given for the D1-S60 region of BSAP1. The calculated BSAP1 structure could be divided into an N and C subdomain (Fig. 5, B and C). The N subdomain spans from D1 to F33 and includes the N loop framed by C6 and C18 and the major loop Y21-L30 with an antiparallel β sheet stabilized by four hydrogen bonds between residues M24-Q27 and C22-K29. The C subdomain spans roughly between C39 and S60 and is arranged by the C18-C49 and C39-C54 disulfide bonds. The region D46-S57 forms a tight minor loop maintained by hydrogen bonds between residues D46-S57, L53-C18, and C49-A37. Finally, the C subdomain is followed by a flexible and unstructured C-terminal region A61-K86. Through millions of years of adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle, blood-sucking parasites have acquired numerous secreted bioactive compounds to counteract host hemostasis and immune responses. Ticks stand out from the rest of blood-feeding parasites because, due to active gene duplication, the tick's saliva composition is more complex and includes thousands of peptides and proteins (20Tirloni L.

Ticks target almost every aspect of their host defense mechanism, and therefore, tick salivary proteins are a rich source of candidates for the development of novel therapeutics and tools for surveying the underlying mechanisms of hemostasis and immune response.

https://openalex.org/W3170609244,"Amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is the major pathogenic molecule in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 enzyme is essential for the generation of Aβ. Deficiency of p38α-MAPK in neurons increases lysosomal degradation of BACE1 and decreases Aβ deposition in the brain of APP-transgenic mice. However, the mechanisms mediating effects of p38α-MAPK are largely unknown. In this study, we used APP-transgenic mice and cultured neurons and observed that deletion of p38α-MAPK specifically in neurons decreased phosphorylation of Snapin at serine, increased retrograde transportation of BACE1 in axons and reduced BACE1 at synaptic terminals, which suggests that p38α-MAPK deficiency promotes axonal transportation of BACE1 from its predominant locations, axonal terminals, to lysosomes in the cell body. In vitro kinase assay revealed that p38α-MAPK directly phosphorylates Snapin. By further performing mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed mutagenic experiments in SH-SY5Y cell lines, we identified serine residue 112 as a p38α-MAPK-phosphorylating site on Snapin. Replacement of serine 112 with alanine did abolish p38α-MAPK knockdown-induced reduction of BACE1 activity and protein level, and transportation to lysosomes in SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our study suggests that activation of p38α-MAPK phosphorylates Snapin and inhibits the retrograde transportation of BACE1 in axons, which might exaggerate amyloid pathology in AD brain."
https://openalex.org/W3172354462,"The assessment of well-being remains an important topic for many disciplines including medical, psychological, social, educational, and economic fields. The present study assesses the reliability and validity of a five-item instrument for evaluating physical, psychological, spiritual, relational, and general well-being. This measure uniquely utilizes a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale in which a respondent selects a whole number that best reflects the intensity of the investigated characteristic. In study one, 939 clinical (i.e., diagnosed with cancer and liver disease with cirrhosis) and non-clinical (i.e., undergraduate students and their family and acquaintances) participants between the ages of 18 to 87 years (M = 47.20 years, SD = 19.62, 54% males) were recruited. Results showed items have strong discriminant ability and the spread of threshold parameters attests to the appropriateness of the response categories. Moreover, convergent and discriminant validity were found with other self-report measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, optimism, well-being) and the measure showed responsiveness to two separate interventions for clinical populations. In study two, 287 Canadian (ages ranged from 18 to 30 years; M = 20.78, SD = 3.32; 23% males) and 342 Italian undergraduate psychology students (age ranged from 18 to 29 years, M = 21.21 years, SD = 1.73, 38% males) were recruited to complete self-report questionnaires. IRT-based differential item functioning analyses provided evidence that the item properties were similar for the Italian and English versions of the scale. Additionally, the validity results obtained in study one were replicated and similar relationships between criterion variables were found when comparing the Italian- and the English-speaking samples. Overall, the current study provides evidence that the Italian and English versions of the WB-NRSs offer added value in research focused on well-being and in assessing well-being changes prompted by intervention programs."

Although various chemicals are available to manage BLB, they are toxic to the environment as well as humans. Hence there is a need to develop new pesticides as alternatives to hazardous chemicals. Therefore, a study was carried out to discover new potent natural pesticides against Xoo from different solvent extracts of Vernonia cinerea . Among all the fractions, the methanolic extract showed the highest inhibition zone. Further, to gain mechanistic insight of inhibitory action, 40 molecules of methanolic extracts were subjected for in silico study against two enzymes D-alanine—D-alanine ligase (Ddl) and Peptide deformylase (PDF). In silico study showed Rutin and Methanone, [1,4-dimethyl-7-(1- methylethyl)-2- azulenyl]phenyl have a good binding affinity with Ddl while Phenol, 2,4-bis(1-phenylethyl)- and 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester showed an excellent binding affinity to PDF. Finally, the system biology approach was applied to understand the agrochemical’s effect in the cell system of bacteria against both the enzymes. Conclusively, these four-hit compounds may have strong potential against Xoo and can be used as biopesticides in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3168760370,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia as it presents distinctive ischemic patterns. Deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) are employed to extract data-derived features and to recognize natural patterns. Hence, CNN enable an unbiased view on well-known clinical phenomenon, e.g., myocardial ischemia. This study tested a novel, hypothesis-generating approach using pre-trained CNN to determine the optimal ischemic parameter as obtained from the highly susceptible intracoronary ECG (icECG).This was a retrospective observational study in 228 patients with chronic coronary syndrome. Each patient had participated in clinical trials with icECG recording and ST-segment shift measurement at the beginning (i.e., non-ischemic) and the end (i.e., ischemic) of a one-minute proximal coronary artery balloon occlusion establishing the reference. Using these data (893 icECGs in total), two pre-trained, open-access CNN (GoogLeNet/ResNet101) were trained to recognize ischemia. The best performing CNN during training were compared with the icECG ST-segment shift for diagnostic accuracy in the detection of artificially induced myocardial ischemia.Using coronary patency or occlusion as reference for absent or present myocardial ischemia, receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC)-analysis of manually obtained icECG ST-segment shift (mV) showed an area under the ROC-curve (AUC) of 0.903±0.043 (p<0.0001, sensitivity 80%, specificity 92% at a cut-off of 0.279mV). The best performing CNN showed an AUC of 0.924 (sensitivity 93%, specificity 92%). DeLong-Test of the ROC-curves showed no significant difference between the AUCs. The underlying morphology responsible for the network prediction differed between the trained networks but was focused on the ST-segment and the T-wave for myocardial ischemia detection.When tested in an experimental setting with artificially induced coronary artery occlusion, quantitative icECG ST-segment shift and CNN using pathophysiologic prediction criteria detect myocardial ischemia with similarly high accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3166394082,"Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (SEE) is a host-restricted bacterium that causes the common infectious upper respiratory disease known as strangles in horses. Perpetuation of SEE infection appears attributable to inapparent carrier horses because it neither persists long-term in the environment nor infects other host mammals or vectors, and infection results in short-lived immunity. Whether pathogen factors enable SEE to remain in horses without causing clinical signs remains poorly understood. Thus, our objective was to use next-generation sequencing technologies to characterize the genome, methylome, and transcriptome of isolates of SEE from horses with acute clinical strangles and inapparent carrier horses-including isolates recovered from individual horses sampled repeatedly-to assess pathogen-associated changes that might reflect specific adaptions of SEE to the host that contribute to inapparent carriage. The accessory genome elements and methylome of SEE isolates from Sweden and Pennsylvania revealed no significant or consistent differences between acute clinical and inapparent carrier isolates of SEE. RNA sequencing of SEE isolates from Pennsylvania demonstrated no genes that were differentially expressed between acute clinical and inapparent carrier isolates of SEE. The absence of specific, consistent changes in the accessory genomes, methylomes, and transcriptomes of acute clinical and inapparent carrier isolates of SEE indicates that adaptations of SEE to the host are unlikely to explain the carrier state of SEE. Efforts to understand the carrier state of SEE should instead focus on host factors."
https://openalex.org/W3170512939,"Glucocorticoids, widely prescribed for anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive purposes, are the most common secondary cause for osteoporosis and related fractures. Current anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies are insufficient for treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis due to contraindications or concerns of side effects. Glucocorticoids have been shown to disrupt Wnt signaling in osteoblast-lineage cells, but the efficacy for Wnt proteins to restore bone mass after glucocorticoid therapy has not been examined. Here by using two mouse genetic models wherein WNT7B expression is temporally activated by either tamoxifen or doxycycline in osteoblast-lineage cells, we show that WNT7B recovers bone mass following glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, thanks to increased osteoblast number and function. However, WNT7B overexpression in bone either before or after glucocorticoid treatments does not ameliorate the abnormal accumulation of body fat. The study demonstrates a potent bone anabolic function for WNT7B in countering glucocorticoid-induced bone loss."

https://openalex.org/W3114000695,"We previously discovered the implication of membrane-type 5-matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we shed new light on pathogenic mechanisms by which MT5-MMP controls the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the fate of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) as well as its precursor C99, and C83. We found in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) carrying the APP Swedish familial mutation (HEKswe) that deleting the C-terminal non-catalytic domains of MT5-MMP hampered its ability to process APP and release the soluble 95 kDa form (sAPP95). Catalytically inactive MT5-MMP variants increased the levels of Aβ and promoted APP/C99 sorting in the endolysosomal system, likely through interactions of the proteinase C-terminal portion with C99. Most interestingly, the deletion of the C-terminal domain of MT5-MMP caused a strong degradation of C99 by the proteasome and prevented Aβ accumulation. These discoveries reveal new control of MT5-MMP over APP by proteolytic and non-proteolytic mechanisms driven by the C-terminal domains of the proteinase. The targeting of these non-catalytic domains of MT5-MMP could, therefore, provide new insights into the therapeutic regulation of APP-related pathology in AD."
https://openalex.org/W3166432529,"Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are a large family of proteins that act primarily at different posttranscriptional steps of organellar gene expression. We have previously found that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe PPR protein mpal10 interacts with mitochondrial translational activator Mpa1, and both are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. However, it is unclear how these two proteins function in mitochondrial protein synthesis in S. pombe. In this study, we further investigated the role of Ppr10 and Mpa1 in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mitochondrial translational initiation requires two initiation factors, Mti2 and Mti3, which bind to the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mt-SSU) during the formation of the mitochondrial translational initiation complex. Using sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, we found that disruption of ppr10, mpa1, or the PPR motifs in Ppr10 impairs the association of Mti2 and Mti3 with the mt-SSU, suggesting that both Ppr10 and Mpa1 may be required for the interaction of Mti2 and Mti3 with the mt-SSU during the assembly of mitochondrial translational initiation complex. Loss of Ppr10 perturbs the association of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b (cob1) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) mRNAs with assembled mitochondrial ribosomes. Proteomic analysis revealed that a fraction of Ppr10 and Mpa1 copurified with a subset of mitoribosomal proteins. The PPR motifs of Ppr10 are necessary for its interaction with Mpa1 and that disruption of these PPR motifs impairs mitochondrial protein synthesis. Our results suggest that Ppr10 and Mpa1 function together to mediate mitochondrial translational initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3167257814,"Central to the ability of cells to respond to changes in amino acid availability is the RagA–RagC heterodimer that behaves as a molecular switch for the mTORC1 pathway—inactivating it during conditions of low amino acid availability and activating it when amino acid concentrations are high. To promote mTORC1, RagA is loaded with GTP and RagC is loaded with GDP, while the reverse nucleotide-loading configuration inhibits the pathway. In this study, we identified an interdomain hydrogen bond required for maintenance of the oppositely loaded nucleotide configuration. Abolishing this interdomain hydrogen bond dysregulates the ability of the heterodimer to maintain its oppositely loaded nucleotide configuration in vitro, while leading to distorted responses to changes in amino acid availability in cells."

The area extent of such restored areas is unknown and there is also paucity of data on success of restoration, species diversity and compositional dynamics of such restored landscapes, particularly using mixed species. This study assessed stand structure, diversity and composition dynamics of sites restored with mixed species and models species abundance distribution on these sites. Three reclaimed and one control site (adjacent natural forest) were inventoried using 27, 30 x 30 m plots on the Hwini-Butre and Benso concession of the Golden Star Wassa Limited. Overall 3057 (per 24 plots) and 150 (per 3 plots) individual trees were recorded in the overstorey of the reclaimed and control sites, respectively. In all, 31 species in 13 families occurred on the reclaimed site while 61 species in 29 families occurred on the control. Species richness, abundance and diversity were significantly lower in the reclaimed sites than the control in the overstorey (p≤0.018), mid-storey (p ≤ 0.032), and understorey (p≤ 0.031). Species composition of the reclaimed and control sites were mostly dissimilar in the overstorey, midstorey, and understorey. However, the midstorey and overstorey of the reclaimed sites showed high similarity in composition (Jaccard's index = 0.817). Pioneer and shade-tolerant species were most dominant in the understorey of the control while only shade-tolerant species (mostly herbs and grasses) dominated the reclaimed sites. Species abundance distribution of both reclaimed and control sites followed the geometric series model, indicating that both sites are disturbed but at different intensities. It is concluded that reclamation with mixed species does not necessarily lead to rapid restoration of indigenous climax species on mine spoils. Nonetheless, it may lead to accomplishments of short-term goals of stabilizing and protecting landscapes while conditioning the sites for colonisation of the climax species."
https://openalex.org/W3170722572,"Gambling may range from being a recreational leisure activity to a behavioral addiction. A rising number of gamblers experience adverse consequences from gambling, termed problem gambling, which may become a challenge for the individual and society. With the present research, we aimed to investigate the correlates of problem gambling. We used a large sample of more than 12,500 individuals (46% male, Mage = 48, SDage = 18) from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey and analyzed sociodemographic and personality variables (Big Five, locus of control) as well as the extent of problem gambling. Findings showed that male sex and a lower level of education were related to problem gambling, but personality traits were predictive of problem gambling over and above sociodemographic variables. Specifically, a low level of emotional stability, an external locus of control, and, to a lesser extent, a low level of conscientiousness and a high level of extraversion were predictive of problem gambling, whereas openness and agreeableness were not. These results remained constant across various robustness analyses. Our findings reveal the importance of including personality traits when explaining gambling behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3171107472,"In a previous study, we showed that replication through the N1-methyl-deoxyadenosine (1-MeA) adduct in human cells is mediated via three different Polι/Polθ, Polη, and Polζ-dependent pathways. Based on biochemical studies with these Pols, in the Polι/Polθ pathway, we inferred a role for Polι in the insertion of a nucleotide (nt) opposite 1-MeA and of Polθ in extension of synthesis from the inserted nt; in the Polη pathway, we inferred that this Pol alone would replicate through 1-MeA; in the Polζ pathway, however, the Pol required for inserting an nt opposite 1-MeA had remained unidentified. In this study, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence for a role for Polλ in inserting the correct nt T opposite 1-MeA, from which Polζ would extend synthesis. The high proficiency of purified Polλ for inserting a T opposite 1-MeA implicates a role for Polλ—which normally uses W-C base pairing for DNA synthesis—in accommodating 1-MeA in a syn confirmation and forming a Hoogsteen base pair with T. The potential of Polλ to replicate through DNA lesions by Hoogsteen base pairing adds another novel aspect to Polλ’s role in translesion synthesis in addition to its role as a scaffolding component of Polζ. We discuss how the action mechanisms of Polλ and Polζ could be restrained to inserting a T opposite 1-MeA and extending synthesis thereafter, respectively. In a previous study, we showed that replication through the N1-methyl-deoxyadenosine (1-MeA) adduct in human cells is mediated via three different Polι/Polθ, Polη, and Polζ-dependent pathways. Based on biochemical studies with these Pols, in the Polι/Polθ pathway, we inferred a role for Polι in the insertion of a nucleotide (nt) opposite 1-MeA and of Polθ in extension of synthesis from the inserted nt; in the Polη pathway, we inferred that this Pol alone would replicate through 1-MeA; in the Polζ pathway, however, the Pol required for inserting an nt opposite 1-MeA had remained unidentified. In this study, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence for a role for Polλ in inserting the correct nt T opposite 1-MeA, from which Polζ would extend synthesis. The high proficiency of purified Polλ for inserting a T opposite 1-MeA implicates a role for Polλ—which normally uses W-C base pairing for DNA synthesis—in accommodating 1-MeA in a syn confirmation and forming a Hoogsteen base pair with T. The potential of Polλ to replicate through DNA lesions by Hoogsteen base pairing adds another novel aspect to Polλ’s role in translesion synthesis in addition to its role as a scaffolding component of Polζ. We discuss how the action mechanisms of Polλ and Polζ could be restrained to inserting a T opposite 1-MeA and extending synthesis thereafter, respectively. Translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) exhibit a high specificity for replicating through different types of DNA lesions. Whereas replication through certain DNA lesions can be performed by just one Pol, such as by Polη opposite cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) (1Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S.

Furthermore, in a recent study we provided evidence for an indispensable role of Polλ as a scaffolding component of Polζ; and from TLS studies opposite a number of DNA lesions, we inferred that Polλ-dependent TLS by Polζ operates in a predominantly error-free manner in human cells (22Yoon J.H. Basu D. Sellamuthu K. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. A novel role of DNA polymerase lambda in translesion synthesis in conjunction with DNA polymerase zeta.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that study we analyzed Polλ’s role in TLS opposite the UV lesions CPDs and (6–4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6–4) PPs, the oxidative DNA lesion thymine glycol (Tg), and the 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (εdA) lesion—formed in DNA through interaction with aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation. In TLS opposite CPD, Tg, and εdA, Polζ extends synthesis from the nt inserted opposite the lesion site by another DNA Pol; and although Polλ is indispensable for Polζ’s role in TLS opposite these DNA lesions, its DNA polymerase activity is not required. Thus, for TLS opposite these DNA lesions, only Polλ’s scaffolding activity is required (22Yoon J.H. Basu D. Sellamuthu K. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. A novel role of DNA polymerase lambda in translesion synthesis in conjunction with DNA polymerase zeta.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For TLS opposite (6–4) PPs, however, Polλ’s polymerase activity is also required, and Polλ promotes error-free replication through this lesion in human and mouse cells (22Yoon J.H. Basu D.

A. 1999; 96: 6632-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how Polλ, which uses W-C base pairing for normal DNA synthesis, manages error-free TLS opposite this DNA lesion. N1-methyl-deoxyadenosine (1-MeA) is repaired by direct demethylation, primarily by the ABH2 enzyme in human cells (27Ringvoli J. Nordstrand L.M. Vagbo C.B. Talstad V. Reite K. Aas P.A. Lauritzen K.H.

The evidence that 1-MeA residues accumulate over time in the genomic DNA of the livers from ABH2 null mice has indicated that endogenous DNA methylation contributes to their formation (27Ringvoli J. Nordstrand L.M. Vagbo C.B. Talstad V. Reite K. Aas P.A. Lauritzen K.H. Liabakk N.B. Bjork A. Doughty R.W. Falnes P.O. Krokan H.E. Klungland A.

In human cells, TLS through the 1-MeA adduct is mediated via three independent pathways in which Polι and Polθ function in one pathway and Pols η and ζ function in the other two pathways, respectively (28Conde J. Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetic control of replication through N1-methyladenine in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TLS by all three pathways operates in a predominantly error-free manner in human cells. For the Polι/Polθ pathway, following nt insertion by Polι opposite 1-MeA by forming a Hoogsteen base pair with the T residue (29Jain R. Choudhury J.R. Buku A. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Mechanism of error-free DNA synthesis across N1-methyl-deoxyadenosine by human DNA polymerase-iota.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 43904Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), Polθ would extend synthesis, whereas in the Polη pathway, Polη would perform both the steps of TLS (28Conde J. Yoon J.H.

Chem. 2015; 290: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our evidence for the requirement of Polλ as an indispensable scaffolding component of Polζ strongly suggested that it would be required for Polζ-dependent TLS opposite 1-MeA; further, it raised the possibility that Polλ may insert the correct nt opposite 1-MeA from which Polζ could extend synthesis. Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidence for the role of Polλ in conjunction with Polζ in mediating error-free replication through 1-MeA by inserting the correct nt opposite it. We discuss how by adopting Hoogsteen base pairing as a mechanism for inserting the correct nt opposite 1-MeA, Polλ could promote error-free replication through this adduct. In our previous analyses of the genetic control of TLS opposite 1-MeA in human cells, we identified the involvement of three independent Polι/Polθ, Polη, and Polζ pathways (28Conde J. Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetic control of replication through N1-methyladenine in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the Polζ pathway, however, the identity of the Pol that could insert an nt opposite 1-MeA had remained unknown. To determine whether Polλ functions together with Polζ, we analyzed the effects of siRNA depletion of Polλ alone and in combination with depletion of other TLS Pols on TLS frequency opposite 1-MeA carried on the leading strand template in the duplex plasmid in which bidirectional replication initiates from an origin of replication (28Conde J. Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetic control of replication through N1-methyladenine in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, TLS in normal human fibroblasts (HFs) treated with control (NC) siRNA occurs with a frequency of ∼63%. In Polη depleted cells, TLS frequency is reduced to ∼53% and depletion of Polι, Polθ, Rev3, or Polλ reduced TLS frequency to 40 to 46%. Our evidence that codepletion of Polλ with Polη, Polι, or Polθ reduces TLS frequency nearly to ∼27% indicated a role for Polλ in a TLS pathway independent of Polη or Polι/Polθ pathways, and our observation that TLS frequency remains the same in cells codepleted for Polλ and Rev3 (∼42%) as in cells depleted for either Pol alone implicated a role for Polλ in TLS in conjunction with Polζ.Table 1Effects of siRNA knockdowns of Polλ and other TLS Pols on replicative bypass of 1-MeA carried on the leading DNA strand template in normal human fibroblastssiRNANumber of Kan+ coloniesNumber of blue colonies among Kan+ coloniesTLS (%)NC40725863.4Polη36819653.3Polι35616546.3Polθ47518939.8Rev334415745.6Polλ43620446.8Polη + Polλ39010426.7Polι + Polλ40811427.9Polθ + Polλ41711226.9Rev3 + Polλ31713442.3 Open table in a new tab To provide further evidence for the role of Polλ in TLS with Polζ, we analyzed the effects or Polλ depletion alone and in combination with the depletion of other TLS Pols in XPV HFs (Table 2). In control siRNA-treated XPV HFs, TLS opposite 1-MeA occurs with a frequency of ∼47% and as expected from the role of Polι/Polθ and Polλ/Polζ in Polη-independent pathways, TLS frequency is reduced to ∼30% in XPV HFs depleted for Polι, Polθ, Rev3, or Polλ (Table 2). Our results that TLS frequency is reduced to ∼5% in XPV HFs codepleted for Polλ either with Polι or with Polθ and that TLS frequency remains nearly the same (∼29%) in XPV HFs codepleted for Polλ and Rev3 as in cells depleted for either Pol alone add further support for the role of Polλ in TLS opposite 1-MeA together with Polζ and independent of Polι and Polθ. Altogether from TLS analyses in WT HFs and XPV HFs, we conclude that TLS through 1-MeA operates via three independent Polι/Polθ, Polη, and Polλ/Polζ pathways (Fig. 1).Table 2Effects of siRNA knockdowns of Polλ and other TLS Pols on replicative bypass of 1-MeA carried on the leading DNA strand template in XPV human fibroblastssiRNANumber of Kan+ coloniesNumber of blue colonies among Kan+ coloniesTLS (%)NC39618045.5Polι41012430.2Polθ39511027.8Rev342612930.3Polλ50214528.9Polι + Polλ230114.8Polθ + Polλ426235.4Rev3 + Polλ47213628.8 Open table in a new tab To determine if Polλ’s polymerase activity was required for TLS opposite 1-MeA, we analyzed the effects of the D427A, D429A mutations, which inactivate this activity. For these studies, we stably expressed siRNA-resistant wild-type human Polλ or the D427A, D429A catalytic mutant Polλ in WT HFs. As shown in Table 3, TLS opposite 1-MeA in Polλ-depleted HFs harboring the vector plasmid occurs with a frequency of ∼45%, and the frequency rises to ∼64% in cells expressing WT Polλ. Our results that TLS frequency is reduced to the same level (∼45%) in cells expressing the D427A, D429A catalytic mutant as in cells harboring the vector plasmid establish the requirement of Polλ’s polymerase activity for TLS through 1-MeA in human cells. Additionally, we confirmed the requirement of Polλ’s polymerase activity for TLS through this adduct in Polλ−/− MEFs (Table 4).Table 3Effects of catalytically active (WT) Polλ, catalytically inactive D427A, D429A Polλ, N-terminally deleted (245–575) Polλ, catalytically active (WT) Rev1, catalytically inactive D570A, E571A Rev1, catalytically active (WT) Rev3, or catalytically inactive D2781A, D2783A Rev3 on TLS opposite 1-MeA carried on the leading DNA strand template in normal human fibroblastsVector expressingsiRNANumber of Kan+ coloniesNumber of blue colonies among Kan+ coloniesTLS (%)No Polλ (control)Polλ37216644.6WT (1–575) PolλPolλ32620863.8D427A, D429A PolλPolλ30613845.1(245–575) PolλPolλ33421664.7No Rev3 (control)Rev329412442.2WT Rev3Rev324216166.5D2781A, D2783A Rev3Rev340918044.0No Rev1 (control)Rev135410629.9WT Rev1Rev148430262.4D570A, E571A Rev1Rev124815863.7 Open table in a new tab Table 4Effects of catalytically active (WT) Polλ, catalytically inactive D427A, D429A Polλ, or N-terminally deleted (245–575) Polλ on TLS opposite 1-MeA carried on the leading DNA strand template in Polλ−/− MEFsVector expressingNumber of Kan+ coloniesNumber of blue colonies among Kan+ coloniesTLS (%)No Polλ (control)34014642.9WT Polλ31819461.0D427A, D429A Polλ37515340.8(245–575) Polλ27617061.6 Open table in a new tab Polλ is a 575 residue polypeptide that contains an N-terminal BRCT domain. We have shown previously that N-terminally deleted Polλ comprised of residues 245 to 575, which lacks the BRCT domain and the proline-rich region, physically interacts with the Rev7 subunit of Polζ and that this N-terminally deleted Polλ supports TLS through (6–4) TT photoproduct in human cells (22Yoon J.H. Basu D. Sellamuthu K. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. A novel role of DNA polymerase lambda in translesion synthesis in conjunction with DNA polymerase zeta.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results that expression of (245–575) Polλ in HFs supports WT levels of TLS (Table 3) confirm that the N-terminal BRCT domain and the adjoining proline-rich region are also not required for Polλ’s role in TLS through 1-MeA in HFs (Table 3); additionally, we confirmed these results in Polλ−/− MEFs (Table 4). The requirement of Polλ’s polymerase activity for TLS through the 1-MeA adduct in conjunction with Polζ in human cells suggested that Polλ would insert an nt opposite 1-MeA from which Polζ would extend synthesis. Hence, we examined purified Polλ for its ability to insert dATP, dTTP, dGTP, or dCTP opposite 1-MeA and to synthesize DNA through the adduct in the presence of all four dNTPs. As shown in Figure 2, Polλ replicates through the undamaged template residue A by inserting a T. Opposite 1-MeA also Polλ inserts a T and then extends synthesis similar to that on undamaged DNA. The high proficiency of Polλ for inserting the correct nt opposite 1-MeA stands in sharp contrast to the error-proneness of purified Polι or Polη opposite this adduct (28Conde J. Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetic control of replication through N1-methyladenine in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus in addition to the insertion of a T, Polι inserts an A or a C opposite 1-MeA, and steady-state kinetic analyses have indicated that it does so with only an ∼100-fold lower catalytic efficiency than for the insertion of correct T (29Jain R. Choudhury J.R. Buku A. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Mechanism of error-free DNA synthesis across N1-methyl-deoxyadenosine by human DNA polymerase-iota.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 43904Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Likewise, compared with the catalytic efficiency for the insertion of a T, Polη inserts an A or a G opposite 1-MeA with only an ∼40-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency, and it inserts a C opposite 1-MeA with only an ∼100-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (Table 5). Nevertheless, in spite of their error-proneness in vitro, both these Pols conduct predominantly error-free TLS through 1-MeA in human cells (28Conde J. Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Prakash L.

The nucleotide incorporation rate was plotted against dNTP concentration and the data were fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation. Apparent Km and kcat values were obtained from the fit and used to calculate the efficiency of deoxynucleotide incorporation (kcat/Km). The ability of purified Polλ for replicating through the 1-MeA adduct with nearly the same proficiency as for replicating undamaged DNA raised the question of whether Polζ’s polymerase activity was required for TLS through this adduct in human cells. To examine this, we expressed full-length WT Rev3, or the D2781A, D2783A mutant Rev3, defective in its polymerase activity, in HFs. In Rev3-depleted HFs harboring the vector plasmid, TLS opposite 1-MeA occurs with a frequency of ∼42% and TLS frequency rises to ∼66% in cells expressing WT Rev3. Our results that in cells expressing the D2781A, D2783A Rev3 catalytic mutant, TLS is reduced to the same level (∼44%) as in cells harboring the vector control (Table 3) confirm that the Rev3 DNA polymerase activity is, in fact, required for TLS through 1-MeA in human cells. In previous studies opposite a number of DNA lesions, we have provided evidence for a scaffolding role of Rev1 in TLS by Y-family Pols (11Yoon J.H. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S.

To confirm that Rev1 plays a similar role in TLS by Polι and Polη opposite 1-MeA, we analyzed the epistatic relationship of Rev1 with these Pols. Our results that TLS occurs at the same frequency in Rev1 depleted HFs (∼30%) as in cells depleted for Rev1 together with Polη or with Polι and that TLS frequency is reduced to ∼6% in cells depleted for Rev1 together with Rev3 or with Polλ (Table 6) concur with a role of Rev1 in TLS in Polι and Polη-dependent pathways that operate independently or Polλ/Polζ pathway. To confirm that Rev1’s polymerase activity is not required for TLS opposite 1-MeA, we expressed full-length WT Rev1, or D570A, E571A Rev1 defective in its DNA polymerase activity, in HFs. Our results that the catalytic mutant Rev1 supports the same level of TLS (∼64%) as the WT Rev1 (∼62%) (Table 3) confirmed that Rev1’s polymerase activity was not required. Thus, only the scaffolding role of Rev1 is required for the Polι and Polη TLS pathways.Table 6Effects of siRNA knockdowns of Rev1 and other TLS Pols on replicative bypass of 1-MeA carried on the leading DNA strand template in normal human fibroblastssiRNANumber of Kan+ coloniesNumber of blue colonies among Kan+ coloniesTLS (%)NC47630764.5Rev134010430.6Polη + Rev137811229.6Polι + Rev140212029.9Rev3 + Rev1382225.8Polλ + Rev1420245.7 Open table in a new tab Since the addition of a methyl group to the N1 atom of deoxyadenosine disrupts W-C base pairing (29Jain R. Choudhury J.R. Buku A. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Mechanism of error-free DNA synthesis across N1-methyl-deoxyadenosine by human DNA polymerase-iota.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 43904Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the insertion of T opposite 1-MeA by Polλ could occur only if the adduct is accommodated in a syn conformation in its active site and the adduct forms a Hoogsteen base pair with T. Thus Polλ active site, which normally accommodates template residues in an anti conformation and forms a W-C base pair with the incoming nt (30Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. A closed conformation for the Pol lambda catalytic cycle.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 97-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), would stabilize 1-MeA in a syn conformation. Such an ability of Polλ active site to accommodate a W-C impairing DNA lesion in a syn conformation would add another novel aspect to Polλ’s function in TLS—in addition to its role as a scaffolding component of Polζ for TLS in human cells. Even though purified Polλ inserts a T opposite 1-MeA and extends synthesis, Polζ’s polymerase activity is still required for replication through 1-MeA in human cells. The requirement of both the Polλ and Polζ polymerase activities strongly suggests that their polymerase activities are restrained to act at the nt insertion or the extension step of TLS in human cells. We presume that in the multiprotein ensemble of Polλ-Polζ, the action mechanism of the two Pols is restrained such that Polλ’s action is limited to inserting a T opposite 1-MeA and Polζ functions at the extension step. The decipherment of the action mechanism of these Pols in human cells would require the identification of the components of the Polλ-Polζ multiprotein ensemble and biochemical analyses of Polλ’s and Polζ’s role in TLS opposite 1-MeA in the Polλ-Polζ ensemble. Our evidence that similar to the requirement of Rev1 as a scaffolding component of Y-family Pols for TLS opposite CPDs, (6–4) PPs, 3-methyl deoxyadenosine, εdA, and other DNA lesions, Rev1’s scaffolding role is required for TLS opposite 1-MeA by Polι and Polη suggests that Rev1 would effect the assembly of these Y-family Pols with the other protein components and that the fidelity of Polι and Polη for TLS opposite 1-MeA would be elevated in the respective multiprotein ensemble thus formed. Polι differs from other Y-family Pols in that its active site accommodates a template purine A or G in a syn conformation, which then forms a Hoogsteen base pair with the incoming nt (31Nair D.T.

However, biochemical studies with Polι have indicated that it can insert not only the correct nt T opposite εdA but also the incorrect nt C with only a few-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency, and structure studies have shown that εdA in Polι active site adopts a syn conformation and that it Hoogsteen base pairs with the incoming dTTP or dCTP (9Nair D.T.

Nevertheless, in spite of the penchant of Polι for inserting a C opposite εdA, Polι conducts error-free TLS opposite this adduct in human cells (11Yoon J.H. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. DNA polymerase theta accomplishes translesion synthesis opposite 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine with a remarkably high fidelity in human cells.Genes Dev. 2019; 33: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Similar to εdA, 1-MeA is accommodated in a syn conformation in Polι’s active site, and it forms a Hoogsteen base pair with T (29Jain R. Choudhury J.R. Buku A. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Mechanism of error-free DNA synthesis across N1-methyl-deoxyadenosine by human DNA polymerase-iota.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 43904Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); however, even though purified Polι misincorporates an A or a C at a frequency of ∼10−2 (29Jain R. Choudhury J.R. Buku A. Johnson R.E.

The adoption of entirely error-free TLS opposite εdA and of predominantly error-free TLS opposite 1-MeA in human cells could be explained if Polι’s error-proneness is annulled in the multiprotein ensemble that the scaffolding role of Rev1 would assemble.

Hence, the hallmark of Polη has been its ability to accommodate two template residues in its active site and to form a W-C base pair with the incoming nt. The proficiency of purified Polη for incorporating a T opposite 1-MeA and the genetic evidence that Polη replicates through this adduct in human cells strongly suggest that Polη accommodates 1-MeA in its active site in a syn conformation, which then Hoogsteen base pairs with the correct nt T or with incorrect nts. We presume that the intrinsic error-proneness of Polη for TLS through 1-MeA is attenuated in the Polη multiprotein ensemble. The heteroduplex vectors containing 1-MeA on the leading or the lagging strand template were constructed as described previously (28Conde J. Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Prakash L. Prakash S.

https://openalex.org/W3172545048,"Sepsis involves a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection that leads to organ dysfunction. Early fluid resuscitation has been advocated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. However, recent studies have shown that a positive fluid balance is associated with increased mortality in septic patients. We investigated if haemoglobin levels on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) could modify the association of fluid balance with mortality in patients with sepsis. We hypothesized that with increasing fluid balance, patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7-10g/dL) would have poorer outcomes compared to those without moderate anemia (hemoglobin >10g/dL).This retrospective study utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients with sepsis, as identified by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th, Clinical Modification codes, were studied. Patients were stratified into those with and without moderate anemia at ICU admission. We investigated the influence of fluid balance measured within 24 hours of ICU admission on 28-day mortality for both patient groups using multivariable logistic regression models. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.8,132 patients (median age 68.6 years, interquartile range 55.1-79.8 years; 52.8% female) were included. Increasing fluid balance (in L) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of 28-day mortality in patients without moderate anemia (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.84-0.97, p = 0.005, at 6-hour). Conversely, increasing fluid balance was associated with a significantly increased risk of 28-day mortality in patients with moderate anemia (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.1, p = 0.022, at 24-hour). Interaction analyses showed that mortality was highest when haemoglobin decreased in patients with moderate anemia who had the most positive fluid balance. Multiple subgroups and sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results.In septic patients admitted to ICU, admission hemoglobin levels modified the association between fluid balance and mortality and are an important consideration for future fluid therapy trials."
https://openalex.org/W3166085809,"The Elongin complex was originally identified as an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation factor and subsequently as the substrate recognition component of a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. More recent evidence indicates that the Elongin ubiquitin ligase assembles with the Cockayne syndrome B helicase (CSB) in response to DNA damage and can target stalled polymerases for ubiquitylation and removal from the genome. In this report, we present evidence that the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase pathway has roles beyond the DNA damage response in the activation of RNAPII-mediated transcription. We observed that assembly of the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase is induced not just by DNA damage, but also by a variety of signals that activate RNAPII-mediated transcription, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, retinoic acid, glucocorticoids, and doxycycline treatment of cells carrying several copies of a doxycycline-inducible reporter. Using glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated genes as a model, we showed that glucocorticoid-induced transcription is accompanied by rapid recruitment of CSB and the Elongin ubiquitin ligase to target genes in a step that depends upon the presence of transcribing RNAPII on those genes. Consistent with the idea that the CSB-Elongin pathway plays a direct role in GR-regulated transcription, mouse cells lacking the Elongin subunit Elongin A exhibit delays in both RNAPII accumulation on and dismissal from target genes following glucocorticoid addition and withdrawal, respectively.

The role of Cockayne Syndrome group B (CSB) protein in base excision repair and aging.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2008; 129: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it is possible that the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex is targeted directly to stalled polymerases by CSB.Early on in our investigation of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase, we discovered that its assembly is potently induced not only by DNA damage and drugs that cause RNAPII stalling, but also by other stimuli such as ER stress, amino acid starvation, and hormone treatment of cells (10Weems J.C. Slaughter B.D. Unruh J.R. Hall S.M. McLaird M.B. Gilmore J.M. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Yasukawa T. Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Assembly of the Elongin A ubiquitin ligase is regulated by genotoxic and other stresses.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15030-15041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings raised the intriguing possibility that the Elongin ubiquitin ligase, with or without CSB, might have a role in processes besides the DNA damage response. Since a shared feature of ER stress, amino acid starvation, and hormone treatment is that they all result in activation of robust RNAPII transcription programs, we considered the possibility that the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex might have roles not only in DNA repair, but also in RNAPII transcription per se.In this report, we present evidence consistent with this model. We show that, like assembly of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase, assembly of CSB with Elongin and the ubiquitin ligase component CUL5 is induced by ER stress, amino acid starvation, and retinoic acid and glucocorticoids. Furthermore, we show that assembly of CSB with Elongin and CUL5 can also be induced simply by doxycycline treatment of U2OS cells carrying chromosomally integrated copies of a doxycycline-inducible reporter gene, arguing that activation of a simple RNAPII transcription program is sufficient to serve as a signal for induction of the CSB-Elongin pathway. Finally, we present evidence (i) that CSB and components of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase are rapidly recruited to glucocorticoid-activated genes in a step that requires the presence of a transcribing polymerase on the gene and (ii) that cells lacking Elongin A exhibit a modest delay in accumulation of RNAPII upon induction of glucocorticoid-responsive genes and a substantial delay in removal of RNAPII from these genes following removal of glucocorticoids. Taken together, our findings bring to light a role for the CSB-Elongin pathway in the regulation of RNAPII transcription.Results and discussionMultiple signaling pathways drive assembly of the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complexTo begin to explore the possibility that CSB and Elongin might function together outside the DNA damage response, we sought to determine whether interaction of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase with CSB is increased by signals other than DNA damage. Because we previously observed that assembly of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase can be induced by thapsigargin, which induces ER stress, histidinol, which mimics amino acid starvation, and the steroid hormone retinoic acid (10Weems J.C. Slaughter B.D. Unruh J.R. Hall S.M. McLaird M.B. Gilmore J.M. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Yasukawa T. Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Chem. 2015; 290: 15030-15041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we asked whether these same agents increase binding of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase to CSB. To accomplish this, we assessed the interactions among CSB, Elongin A (ELOA), and CUL5 in individual living cells using an acceptor photobleaching–fluorescence resonance energy transfer (AP-FRET) assay we previously used to characterize assembly of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase and its interaction with CSB in response to DNA damage (10Weems J.C.

Upon energy transfer, which typically occurs only if the distance between donor and acceptor is ∼100 Å or less, the emission of the donor is quenched and that of the acceptor is enhanced. In these assays, FRET efficiency is measured by comparing donor emission before photobleaching to donor emission after acceptor photobleaching, when the acceptor is no longer available to absorb energy from the donor. In an AP-FRET experiment, the protein labeled with acceptor fluorophore is expressed at levels substantially higher than the protein with the donor fluorophore, so FRET is not limited by the availability of acceptor (18van Munster E.B. Kremers G.J. Adjobo-Hermans M.J. Gadella Jr., T.W. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurement by gradual acceptor photobleaching.J. Microsc. 2005; 218: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, we routinely confirm that AP-FRET signals are independent of levels of donor expression (Fig. S1).In the experiments described here, GFP-CSB and Halo-ElOA or GFP-CSB and mCherry-CUL5 were transiently expressed in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 1A) or a mouse cell line, 3617, which harbors ∼200 tandemly repeated copies of an MMTV-LTR-driven, glucocorticoid-inducible model gene (19Muller W.G.

We then measured total nuclear AP-FRET before and after stimulus, using laser-induced DNA damage as a positive control. Consistent with our previous results (10Weems J.C. Slaughter B.D. Unruh J.R.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6431-6437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we observed low but measurable AP-FRET between Halo-ELOA and GFP-CSB and between mCherry-CUL5 and GFP-CSB in unstimulated cells, indicating that there is a baseline level of interaction between these proteins at steady state. In cells treated with thapsigargin, histidinol, retinoic acid, or the synthetic glucorticoid dexamethasone, AP-FRET signals between ELOA and CSB and between CUL5 and CSB were substantially increased over the low AP-FRET signals seen in untreated cells. This finding suggests that, like DNA damage, these treatments cause an increase in levels of the higher order CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex in cells.Signal-induced Elongin ubiquitin ligase assembly does not require CSBWe previously observed that CSB is not essential for, but modestly enhances, assembly of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase during the DNA damage response (11Weems J.C.

We therefore asked whether CSB is needed for assembly of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase in response to other signaling pathways. To do so, we took advantage of a derivative of human CS1Ansv cells, which were derived from a Cockayne Syndrome patient and lack a functional CSB gene (20Troelstra C. van Gool A.J. de Wit J.

This cell line, designated CS1ANsv-CSB Tet-on, has been engineered to inducibly express wild-type CSB and has been used to study CSB-dependent processes (22Wang Y. Chakravarty P. Ranes M. Kelly G. Brooks P.J. Neilan E. Stewart A. Schiavo G. Svejstrup J.Q. Dysregulation of gene expression as a cause of Cockayne syndrome neurological disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 14454-14459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our experiments, Halo-ELOA and mCherry-CUL5 were transiently expressed in CS1ANsv-CSB Tet-on cells in which CSB expression was induced or not, and AP-FRET between Halo-ELOA and mCherry-CUL5 was measured following treatment of cells with thapsigargin, histidinol, dexamethasone, or retinoic acid.As shown in Figure 1C, induction of CSB expression was not essential for assembly of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase in response to any of these stimuli. As we observed previously (11Weems J.C. Slaughter B.D. Unruh J.R. Boeing S. Hall S.M. McLaird M.B. Yasukawa T. Aso T. Svejstrup J.Q. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6431-6437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), ELOA-CUL5 AP-FRET signals increased after UV irradiation when CSB expression was not induced, but increased roughly 2-fold more in cells expressing CSB. These findings are consistent with results of a previous study in which we observed that there was only a modest increase in the DNA damage-driven interaction between Elongin A and CUL5 upon induction of CSB expression in this cell line, even though recruitment of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase to sites of DNA damage was severely defective when CSB expression was not induced (11Weems J.C. Slaughter B.D. Unruh J.R. Boeing S. Hall S.M. McLaird M.B. Yasukawa T. Aso T. Svejstrup J.Q. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6431-6437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly, ELOA-CUL5 AP-FRET signals increased after treatment with thapsigargin, histidinol, dexamethasone, or retinoic acid in cells lacking CSB, but again were increased about approximately 2-fold more when CSB expression was induced with doxycycline. These observations further reinforce the idea that CSB is likely not essential for assembly of the Elongin ubiquitin ligase, but does enhance or stabilize its assembly. Thus, assembly of the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex appears to proceed similarly in response to DNA damage and to ER stress, amino acid starvation, and steroids, including retinoic acid and dexamethasone. Because these latter stimuli are not known to induce extensive DNA damage, our findings are consistent with the idea that the CSB-Elongin axis plays a role in cellular processes beyond the DNA damage response.Assembly of the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex in response to transcription activationOur evidence that DNA damage is not the sole inducer of assembly of the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex led us to ask what signal(s) might be responsible for driving assembly. Although the DNA damage response, ER stress, amino acid starvation, and hormones can activate different cellular processes, they share one common endpoint: all lead to activation of robust transcription programs. In view of this shared feature and of the known roles of Elongin, the Elongin ubiquitin ligase, and CSB in regulation of transcribing RNAPII, we sought to explore the possibility that transcription activation per se might be sufficient to drive assembly of CSB with the Elongin ubiquitin ligase and activation of the CSB-Elongin axis.As one way to explore this question, we took advantage of a pair of cell lines: U2OS-Luc Tet-On cells, which carry multiple copies of a chromosomally integrated, doxycycline-inducible luciferase reporter driven by an RNAPII promoter, and parental U2OS Tet-On cells, which lack the doxycycline-inducible luciferase reporter gene. By subjecting these cells to brief treatment with doxycycline, we could ask whether rapid activation of new transcription is sufficient to drive binding of CSB to Elongin A and CUL5.U2OS-Luc Tet-On and parental cells without the doxycycline-inducible reporter, transiently expressing Halo-ELOA and either mCherry-CUL5 or mCherry CSB, were treated with 0.5 μg/ml of doxycycline for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. Doxycycline treatment did not increase either ELOA-CUL5 or ELOA-CSB AP-FRET signals in parental U2OS Tet-On cells; however, AP-FRET signals began to increase rapidly after addition of doxycycline to induce transcription of the luciferase reporter in U2OS-Luc Tet-On cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that rapid activation of new transcription is sufficient to lead to substantial increases in assembly of the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, they point to RNAPII transcription as a signal for activation of the CSB-Elongin axis.CSB, Elongin, and CUL5 are recruited to actively transcribed glucocorticoid-regulated genesOur evidence that activation of RNAPII transcription provides a signal leading to assembly of the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex led us to ask whether CSB, Elongin, and the ubiquitin ligase component CUL5 are all recruited to newly activated genes. In initial experiments, we used live cell imaging to address this question in mouse 3617 cells, which have been used extensively in imaging studies of RNAPII transcription regulation (19Muller W.G.

In total, 3617 cells contain a chromosomally integrated, tandem array consisting of ∼200 copies of a glucocorticoid-activated, MMTV promoter-reporter gene cassette. In addition, these cells express glucocorticoid receptor fused to GFP (GR-GFP). In the presence of glucocorticoids, GR-GFP binds glucocorticoid-responsive elements in the MMTV promoter and accumulates at the array, where it can be visualized as fluorescent puncta.In total, 3617 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Halo-ELOA, mCherry-CUL5, or mCherry-CSB and treated with dexamethasone. As shown in Figure 2A, puncta of Halo-Elongin A, mCherry-CUL5, and mCherry-CSB were all detected along with GFP-GR at the MMTV array in dexamethasone-treated cells. Consistent with these observations, in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, we observed that endogenous Elongin A, CUL5, and CSB are recruited with RNAPII to the MMTV promoter region following dexamethasone treatment of cells (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these observations are consistent with the idea that the CSB-Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex is recruited to the MMTV array coincident with activation of RNAPII transcription.Figure 2Triptolide blocks GR-induced recruitment of CSB, Elongin A, and CUL5 to the MMTV LTR.

However, continuous monitoring of the performance of the assay, in particular its impact on the clinical decision in initiating anti-leishmanial treatment and outcomes remains needed as there are concerns about the diagnostic performance of this test.VL patients prospectively enrolled in a diagnostic trial and with rK39 RDT were included. We evaluated the effect of rK39 testing in guiding treatment initiation and outcome. On the basis of rK39 RDT test result as well as clinical case definition for VL and microscopy examination, the clinicians decide whether to initiate VL therapy or not. Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with a decision to initiate VL therapy. In addition, treatment outcomes of those who received VL therapy were compared to those who received non-VL treatment.Of 324 VL suspects enrolled, 184 (56.8%) were rK39+ and 140 (43.2%) were rK39‒. In addition, microscopy exam was done on tissue aspirates from a sub-population (140 individuals), which is 43.2% of the suspected cases, comprising of 117 (63.6%) rK39+ and only 23 (16.4%) rK39‒ cases. Of those with microscopy examination, only 87 (62.1%) were found positive. Among 184 (56.8%) patients without microscopy, 67 (36.4%) were rK39+, of whom 83 (65.9%) were positive by microscopy, 21 (16.7%) were negative by microscopy and 22 (17.5%) had no microscopy results. On the other hand, of those who did not receive VL treatment 58/189 (30.7%) were rK39+ and 131 (69.3%) were rK39‒. Of the rK39+ cases who did not receive VL therapy, only 1 (1.7%) patient was microscopy positive, 12 (20.7%) were negative and 45 (77.6%) patients had no microscopy result. Of the rK39‒ cases (n = 131) who did not receive VL treatment, 16 were microscopy negative and 115 without microscopy exams. Whereas positive rK39 result [adjusted Relative Risk (aRR) 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49-0.96, p = 0.029] and positive microscopy results (aRR 0.03; 95% CI: 0.00-0.24, p = 0.001) were independently associated with VL treatment, having confirmed diagnosis other than VL (aRR 1.64; 95% CI: 1.09-2.46, p = 0.018) was independently associated with initiation of non-VL therapy. The proportion of rK39+ patients who received non-VL treatment with no improvement outcome was significantly higher when compared to those who received VL treatment (24.1%, 95% CI: 14.62-37.16 vs. 11.9%, 95%CI: 7.26-18.93; p<0.0001).The study shows that a significant proportion of patients with rK39+ results were undertreated. Failure to do microscopy was associated with lack of improved clinical outcome. Including an additional simple point-of-care assay in the diagnostic work-up is urgently needed to correctly identify VL cases and to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with the disease."

As reading is one of the most important processes in the maturation of an individual, the aim of the study was to better understand gender differences between primary school students. The study evaluates differences in Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrodermal Activities (EDA) and eye movement of participants during the reading task. Taking into account that colour may affect reading skills, in that it affects the emotional and physiological state of the body, the research attempts to provide a better understanding of gender differences in reading through examining the effect of colour, as applied to reading content. The physiological responses of 50 children (25 boys and 25 girls) to 12 different background and overlay colours of reading content were measured and summarised during the reading process. Our findings show that boys have shorter reading duration scores and a longer Saccade Count, Saccade Duration Total, and Saccade Duration Average when reading on a coloured background, especially purple, which could be caused by their motivation and by the type of reading task. Also, the boys had higher values for the Delta band and the Whole Range of EEG measurements in comparison to the girls when reading on coloured backgrounds, which could reflect the faster maturation of the girls. Regarding EDA measurements we did not find systematic differences between groups either on white or on coloured/overlay background. We found the most significant differences arose in the HRV parameters, namely (SDNN (ms), STD HR (beats/min), RMSSD (ms), NN50 (beats), pNN50 (%), CVRR) when children read the text on coloured/overlay backgrounds, where the girls showed systematically higher values on HRV measurements in comparison to the boys, mostly with yellow, red, and orange overlay colours."

However, there have been limited reports on the isolation and analysis of these cellular complexes of T cell-antigen-presenting cell (T/APC). In this study, we successfully isolated intact antigen-specific cellular complexes of CD8+ T/APC by utilizing a microfluidics cell sorter. Using ovalbumin (OVA) model antigen and OT-I-derived OVA-specific CD8+ T cells, we analyzed the formation of antigen-specific and antigen-non-specific T/APC cellular complexes and revealed that the antigen-specific T/APC cellular complex was highly stable than the non-specific one, and that the intact antigen-specific T/APC complex can be retrieved as well as enriched using a microfluidics sorter, but not a conventional cell sorter. The single T/APC cellular complex obtained can be further analyzed for the sequences of T cell receptor Vα and Vβ genes as well as cognate antigen information simultaneously. These results suggested that this approach can be applied for other antigen and CD8+ T cells of mice and possibly those of humans. We believe that this microfluidics sorting method of the T/APC complex will provide useful information for future T cell immunology research."

The present study was conducted to compare the performance of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (GXpert) assay with composite reference standard in diagnosing cases of tubercular pleural effusion (TPE) and to evaluate the reliability of rifampicin resistance. A cross-sectional study was performed in a Department of Medicine of a rural teaching tertiary care hospital in central India. In all consecutive patients with pleural effusion on chest radiograph presenting to Department of Medicine, GXpert assay and composite reference standard was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of GXpert assay for detecting TPE in comparison to composite reference standard. Standard formulae were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), positive likelihood ratios (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR-). Mc-Nemar's test was applied to compare variables. All comparisons were two-tailed. We considered the difference to be statistically significant if the P value was less than 0.05. The sensitivity of the GXpert assay in diagnosing TPE was 16.6% among 158 study participants, the specificity was 100% and diagnostic accuracy was 52.5% which was statistically significant (p value < 0.05). It had a PPV of 100% (95%CI: 88.3% - 100%) and a NPV of 47.5% (95%CI: 39.3% - 55.7%). The LR+ and LR-were 23.5 (95%CI: 1.43-38.6) and 0.83 (95%CI: 0.76-0.91) respectively. GXpert assay has a very high specificity in diagnosing TPE but has a low sensitivity. In comparison to composite reference standard Thus its clinical utility is limited when used as a standalone test. A physician's clinical acumen in combination with routine pleural fluid analysis should be the key factor in the diagnosis of TPE in clinically and radiologically suspected patients, especially in high TB burden countries."
https://openalex.org/W3172382566,"Spatial inhibition of return (IOR) refers to the phenomenon by which individuals are slower to respond to stimuli appearing at a previously cued location compared to un-cued locations. Here with a group of older adults (n = 56, 58-80 (67.9±5.2) year old, 31 females, 18.7±3.6 years of education), we provide evidence supporting the notion that spatial IOR is mildly impaired in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the impairment is detectable using a double cue paradigm. Furthermore, reduced spatial IOR in high-risk healthy older individuals is associated with reduced memory and other neurocognitive task performance, suggesting that the double cue spatial IOR paradigm may be useful in detecting MCI and early AD."
https://openalex.org/W3166011042,"In this article two multi-stage stochastic linear programming models are developed, one applying the stochastic programming solver integrated by Lingo 17.0 optimization software that utilizes an approximation using an identical conditional sampling and Latin-hyper-square techniques to reduce the sample variance, associating the probability distributions to normal distributions with defined mean and standard deviation; and a second proposed model with a discrete distribution with 3 values and their respective probabilities of occurrence. In both cases, a scenario tree is generated. The models developed are applied to an aggregate production plan (APP) for a furniture manufacturing company located in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, which has important clients throughout the country. Production capacity and demand are defined as random variables of the model. The main purpose of this research is to determine a feasible solution to the aggregate production plan in a reasonable computational time. The developed models were compared and analyzed. Moreover, this work was complemented with a sensitivity analysis; varying the percentage of service level, also, varying the stochastic parameters (mean and standard deviation) to test how these variations impact in the solution and decision variables."
https://openalex.org/W3169522263,"Patients with liver cirrhosis have an increased risk of in-hospital mortality or postoperative complication after surgery. However, large-scale studies on the prognosis of these patients after surgery are lacking. The aim of the study was to investigate the adverse outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis after surgery over five years.We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Inpatient Samples (HIRA-NIS) between 2012 and 2016. In-hospital mortality and hospital stay were analyzed using the data. Mortality rates according to the surgical department were also analyzed. Of the 1,662,887 patients who underwent surgery, 16,174 (1.0%) patients had cirrhosis. The in-hospital mortality (8.0% vs. 1.0%) and postoperative complications such as respiratory (6.0% vs. 5.3%) or infections (2.8% vs. 2.4%) was significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis. In addition, the total hospitalization period and use of the intensive care unit were significantly higher in patients with liver cirrhosis. In propensity score matching analysis, liver cirrhosis increased the risk of adverse outcome significantly [adjusted OR (aOR) 1.67, 95% CI 1.56-1.79, P<0.001], especially in-hospital mortality. In liver cirrhosis group, presence of decompensation or varices showed significantly increased postoperative complication or mortality. Adverse outcomes in patients with cirrhosis was the highest in patients who underwent otorhinolaryngology surgery (aOR 1.86), followed by neurosurgery (aOR 1.72), thoracic and cardiovascular surgery (aOR 1.56), and plastic surgery (aOR 1.36).The adverse outcomes of patients with cirrhosis is significantly high after surgery, despite advances in cirrhosis treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3169958725,"Mineral homeostasis is regulated by a complex network involving endocrine actions by calcitriol, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and FGF23 on several organs including kidney, intestine, and bone. Alterations of mineral homeostasis are found in chronic kidney disease and other systemic disorders. The interplay between the immune system and the skeletal system is not fully understood, but cytokines play a major role in modulating calcitriol production and function. One of the main cellular signaling pathways mediating cytokine function is the Janus kinase (JAK)--signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Here, we used a mouse model (Jak1S645P+/- ) that resembles a constitutive activating mutation of the Jak1/Stat3 signaling pathway in humans, and shows altered mineral metabolism, with higher fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels, lower PTH levels, and higher calcitriol levels. The higher calcitriol levels are probably due to extrarenal calcitriol production. Furthermore, systemic Jak1/Stat3 activation led to growth impairment and skeletal alterations. The growth plate in long bones showed decreased chondrocyte proliferation rates and reduced height of terminal chondrocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Jak1 is also involved in bone remodeling early in life. Jak1S645P+/- animals have decreased bone and cortical volume, imbalanced bone remodeling, reduced MAP kinase signaling, and local inflammation. In conclusion, Jak1 plays a major role in bone health probably both, directly and systemically by regulating mineral homeostasis. Understanding the role of this signaling pathway will contribute to a better knowledge in bone growth and in mineral physiology, and to the development of selective Jak inhibitors as osteoprotective agents."
https://openalex.org/W3171902202,"The PGNAA system for the cement measurement was simulated based on Monte Carlo method. The sizes of the moderator and reflector for the 14 MeV DT neutron generator were optimized for fast and thermal neutron outputs. The DT neutron generator was simulated at the pulse mode, and the gamma-ray detector was set as LaBr 3 (Ce) scintillator. The characteristic peaks of the major elements (Ca, Si, Al, Fe) can be identified from the gamma-ray spectra which induced at the different time intervals of the neutron radiation. For the different thicknesses of the cement sample the ratios of the gamma-ray peaks were observed, and the result showed that when the thickness was between 20 to 30 cm, the ratios became stable. With the ratios, we can calculate the iron modulus, silica modulus and lime saturation factor."
https://openalex.org/W3172465491,"Aging of the nervous system is typified by depressed metabolism, compromised proteostasis, and increased inflammation that results in cognitive impairment. Differential expression analysis is a popular technique for exploring the molecular underpinnings of neural aging, but technical drawbacks of the methodology often obscure larger expression patterns. Co-expression analysis offers a robust alternative that allows for identification of networks of genes and their putative central regulators. In an effort to expand upon previous work exploring neural aging in the marine model Aplysia californica, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis to identify co-expression networks in a targeted set of aging sensory neurons in these animals. We identified twelve modules, six of which were strongly positively or negatively associated with aging. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes analysis and investigation of central module transcripts identified signatures of metabolic impairment, increased reactive oxygen species, compromised proteostasis, disrupted signaling, and increased inflammation. Although modules with immune character were identified, there was no correlation between genes in Aplysia that increased in expression with aging and the orthologous genes in oyster displaying long-term increases in expression after a virus-like challenge. This suggests anti-viral response is not a driver of Aplysia sensory neuron aging."
https://openalex.org/W3172988561,"Differentiating the invasiveness of ground-glass nodules (GGN) is clinically important, and several institutions have attempted to develop their own solutions by using computed tomography images. The purpose of this study is to evaluate Computer-Aided Analysis of Risk Yield (CANARY), a validated virtual biopsy and risk-stratification machine-learning tool for lung adenocarcinomas, in a Korean patient population. To this end, a total of 380 GGNs from 360 patients who underwent pulmonary resection in a single institution were reviewed. Based on the Score Indicative of Lung Cancer Aggression (SILA), a quantitative indicator of CANARY analysis results, all of the GGNs were classified as ""indolent"" (atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinomas in situ, or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma) or ""invasive"" (invasive adenocarcinoma) and compared with the pathology reports. By considering the possibility of uneven class distribution, statistical analysis was performed on the 1) entire cohort and 2) randomly extracted six sets of class-balanced samples. For each trial, the optimal cutoff SILA was obtained from the receiver operating characteristic curve. The classification results were evaluated using several binary classification metrics. Of a total of 380 GGNs, the mean SILA for 65 (17.1%) indolent and 315 (82.9%) invasive lesions were 0.195±0.124 and 0.391±0.208 (p < 0.0001). The area under the curve (AUC) of each trial was 0.814 and 0.809, with an optimal threshold SILA of 0.229 for both. The macro F1-score and geometric mean were found to be 0.675 and 0.745 for the entire cohort, while both scored 0.741 in the class-equalized dataset. From these results, CANARY could be confirmed acceptable in classifying GGN for Korean patients after the cutoff SILA was calibrated. We found that adjusting the cutoff SILA is needed to use CANARY in other countries or races, and geometric mean could be more objective than F1-score or AUC in the binary classification of imbalanced data."
https://openalex.org/W3167105804,"Applying deep learning to the field of preclinical in vivo studies is a new and exciting prospect with the potential to unlock decades worth of underutilized data. As a proof of concept, we performed a feasibility study on a colitis model treated with Sulfasalazine, a drug used in therapeutic care of inflammatory bowel disease. We aimed to evaluate the colonic mucosa improvement associated with the recovery response of the crypts, a complex histologic structure reflecting tissue homeostasis and repair in response to inflammation. Our approach requires robust image segmentation of objects of interest from whole slide images, a composite low dimensional representation of the typical or novel morphological variants of the segmented objects, and exploration of image features of significance towards biology and treatment efficacy. Both interpretable features (eg. counts, area, distance and angle) as well as statistical texture features calculated using Gray Level Co-Occurance Matrices (GLCMs), are shown to have significance in analysis. Ultimately, this analytic framework of supervised image segmentation, unsupervised learning, and feature analysis can be generally applied to preclinical data. We hope our report will inspire more efforts to utilize deep learning in preclinical in vivo studies and ultimately make the field more innovative and efficient."
