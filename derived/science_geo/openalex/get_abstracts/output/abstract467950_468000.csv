The Cas9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR-Cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.

This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity. The ability to perturb the genome in a precise and targeted fashion is crucial for understanding genetic contributions to biology and disease. Genome engineering of cell lines or animal models has traditionally been accomplished through random mutagenesis or low-efficiency gene targeting. To facilitate genome editing, programmable sequence-specific DNA nuclease technologies have enabled targeted modification of endogenous genomic sequences with high efficiency, particularly in species that have proven traditionally genetically intractable (Carlson et al., 2012Carlson D.F.

The Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes can be directed by a chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA) (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E.

A 20 nt guide sequence within the sgRNA directs Cas9 to the genomic target via Watson-Crick base pairing and can be easily programmed to target a desired genomic locus (Deltcheva et al., 2011Deltcheva E.

Recent studies of Cas9 specificity have demonstrated that, although each base within the 20 nt guide sequence contributes to overall specificity, multiple mismatches between the guide RNA and its complementary target DNA sequence can be tolerated depending on the quantity, position, and base identity of mismatches (Cong et al., 2013Cong L.

These unwanted mutations can potentially limit the utility of Cas9 for genome editing applications that require high levels of precision, such as generation of isogenic cell lines for testing causal genetic variations (Soldner et al., 2011Soldner F.

To improve the specificity of Cas9-mediated genome editing, we developed a strategy that combines the D10A mutant nickase version of Cas9 (Cas9n) (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S.

Whereas nicking of both DNA strands by a pair of Cas9 nickases leads to site-specific DSBs and NHEJ, individual nicks are predominantly repaired by the high-fidelity base excision repair pathway (BER) (Dianov and Hübscher, 2013Dianov G.L.

A paired nickase strategy was described while this manuscript was under review, which suggests the possibility for engineering a system to ameliorate off-target activity (Mali et al., 2013aMali P.

Here, we define crucial parameters for the selection of sgRNA pairs that facilitate effective double nicking, compare the specificity of wild-type Cas9 and Cas9n with double nicking, and demonstrate a variety of experimental applications that can be achieved using double nicking in cells as well as in mouse zygotes. Cas9 targeting is facilitated by base pairing between the 20 nt guide sequence within the sgRNA and the target DNA (Deltcheva et al., 2011Deltcheva E. Chylinski K. Sharma C.M. Gonzales K. Chao Y.

A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9327) Google Scholar). We reasoned that cleavage specificity might be improved by increasing the length of base pairing between the guide RNA and its target locus. To test this, we generated U6-driven expression cassettes (Hsu et al., 2013Hsu P.D. Scott D.A. Weinstein J.A. Ran F.A. Konermann S. Agarwala V. Li Y. Fine E.J. Wu X. Shalem O. et al.DNA targeting specificity of RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; (Published online July 21, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar) to express three sgRNAs with 20 (sgRNA 1) or 30 nt guide sequences (sgRNAs 2 and 3) targeting a locus within the human EMX1 gene (Figure 1A). We and others have previously shown that, although single-base mismatches between the PAM-distal region of the guide sequence and target DNA are well tolerated by Cas9, multiple mismatches in this region can significantly affect on-target activity (Fu et al., 2013Fu Y.

Biotechnol. 2013; (Published online August 11, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). To determine whether additional PAM-distal bases (21–30) could influence overall targeting specificity, we designed sgRNAs 2 and 3 to contain additional bases consisting of either 10 perfectly matched or 8 mismatched bases (bases 21–28). Surprisingly, we observed that these extended sgRNAs mediated similar levels of modification at the target locus in HEK293 FT cells regardless of whether the additional bases were complementary to the genomic target (Figure 1B). Subsequent northern blots revealed that the majority of both sgRNA 2 and 3 were processed to the same length as sgRNA 1, which contains the same 20 nt guide sequence without additional bases (Figure 1C). Given that extension of the guide sequence failed to improve Cas9 targeting specificity, we sought an alternative strategy for increasing the overall base-pairing length between the guide sequence and its DNA target. Cas9 enzymes contain two conserved nuclease domains, HNH and RuvC, which cleave the DNA strand complementary and noncomplementary to the guide RNA, respectively. Mutations of the catalytic residues (D10A in RuvC and H840A in HNH) convert Cas9 into DNA nickases (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W.

A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9327) Google Scholar). As single-strand nicks are preferentially repaired by the high-fidelity BER pathway (Dianov and Hübscher, 2013Dianov G.L. Hübscher U. Mammalian base excision repair: the forgotten archangel.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we reasoned that two Cas9-nicking enzymes directed by a pair of sgRNAs targeting opposite strands of a target locus could mediate DSBs while minimizing off-target activity (Figure 2A). A number of factors may affect cooperative nicking leading to indel formation, including steric hindrance between two adjacent Cas9 molecules or Cas9-sgRNA complexes, overhang type, and sequence context; some of these may be characterized by testing multiple sgRNA pairs with distinct target sequences and offsets (the distance between the PAM-distal [5′] ends of the guide sequence of a given sgRNA pair). To systematically assess how sgRNA offsets might affect subsequent repair and generation of indels, we first designed sets of sgRNA pairs targeted against the human EMX1 genomic locus separated by a range of offset distances from approximately −200 to 200 bp to create both 5′ and 3′ overhang products (Figure 2A and Table S1 available online). We then assessed the ability of each sgRNA pair with the D10A Cas9 mutant (referred to as Cas9n; H840A Cas9 mutant is referred to as Cas9H840A) to generate indels in human HEK 293FT cells. Robust NHEJ (up to 40%) was observed for sgRNA pairs with offsets from −4 to 20 bp, with modest indels forming in pairs offset by up to 100 bp (Figure 2B, left). We subsequently recapitulated these findings by testing similarly offset sgRNA pairs at two other genomic loci, DYRK1A and GRIN2B (Figure 2B, right). Of note, across all three loci examined, only sgRNA pairs creating 5′ overhangs with less than 8 bp overlap between the guide sequences (offset greater than −8 bp) were able to mediate detectable indel formation (Figure 2C). Importantly, each guide used in these assays is able to efficiently induce indels when paired with wild-type Cas9 (Table S1), indicating that the relative positions of the guide pairs are the most important parameters in predicting double-nicking activity. Because Cas9n and Cas9H840A nick opposite strands of DNA, substitution of Cas9n with Cas9H840A with a given sgRNA pair should result in the inversion of the overhang type. For example, a pair of sgRNAs that will generate a 5′ overhang with Cas9n should, in principle, generate the corresponding 3′ overhang instead. Therefore, sgRNA pairs that lead to the generation of a 3′ overhang with Cas9n might be used with Cas9H840A to generate a 5′ overhang. Further work will be needed to identify the necessary design rules for sgRNA pairing to allow double nicking by Cas9H840A. Having established that double nicking (DN) mediates high-efficiency NHEJ at levels comparable to those induced by wild-type Cas9 (Table S1), we next studied whether DN has improved specificity over wild-type Cas9 by measuring their off-target activities. We co-delivered Cas9n with sgRNAs 1 and 9, spaced by a +23 bp offset, to target the human EMX1 locus in HEK 293FT cells (Figure 3A). This DN configuration generated on-target indel levels similar to those generated by the wild-type Cas9 paired with each sgRNA alone (Figure 3B, left). Strikingly, unlike with wild-type Cas9, DN did not generate detectable modification at a previously validated sgRNA 1 off-target site, OT-4, by SURVEYOR assay (Hsu et al., 2013Hsu P.D. Scott D.A.

Biotechnol. 2013; (Published online July 21, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar; Figure 3B, right), suggesting that DN can potentially reduce the likelihood of off-target modifications. Using deep sequencing to assess modification at five different sgRNA 1 off-target loci (Figure 3A), we observed significant mutagenesis at all sites with wild-type Cas9 + sgRNA 1 (Figure 3C). In contrast, cleavage by Cas9n at 5 off-target sites tested was barely detectable above background sequencing error. Using the ratio of on- to off-target modification levels as a metric of specificity, we found that Cas9n with a pair of sgRNAs was able to achieve >100-fold greater specificity relative to wild-type Cas9 with one of the sgRNAs (Figure 3D). We conducted additional off-target analysis by deep sequencing for two sgRNA pairs (offsets of +16 and +20 bp) targeting the VEGFA locus, with similar results (Figure 3E). DN at these off-target loci (Table S5) was able to achieve 200- to >1,500-fold greater specificity than the wild-type Cas9 (Figure 3F and Table S1). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cas9-mediated double nicking minimizes off-target mutagenesis and is suitable for genome editing with increased specificity. DSBs can stimulate homology-directed repair (HDR) to enable highly precise editing of genomic target sites. To evaluate DN-induced HDR, we targeted the human EMX1 locus with pairs of sgRNAs offset by −3 and +18 bp (generating 31 and 52 bp 5′ overhangs), respectively, and introduced a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) bearing a HindIII restriction site as the HDR repair template (Figure 4A). Each DN sgRNA pair successfully induced HDR at frequencies higher than those of single-guide Cas9n nickases and comparable to those of wild-type Cas9 (Figure 4B). Furthermore, genome editing in embryonic stem cells or patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells represents a key opportunity for generating and studying new disease paradigms as well as developing new therapeutics. Because single-nick approaches to inducing HDR in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have met with limited success (Hsu et al., 2013Hsu P.D. Scott D.A. Weinstein J.A. Ran F.A. Konermann S. Agarwala V. Li Y. Fine E.J. Wu X. Shalem O. et al.DNA targeting specificity of RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; (Published online July 21, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar), we attempted DN in the HUES62 hES cell line and observed successful HDR (Figure 4C). To further characterize how offset sgRNA spacing affects the efficiency of HDR, we next tested in HEK 293FT cells a set of sgRNA pairs in which the cleavage site of at least one sgRNA is situated near the site of recombination (overlapping with the HDR ssODN donor template arm). We observed that sgRNA pairs generating 5′ overhangs and having at least one nick occurring within 22 bp of the homology arm are able to induce HDR at levels comparable to those of wild-type Cas9-mediated HDR and significantly greater than those of single Cas9n-sgRNA nicking. In contrast, we did not observe HDR with sgRNA pairs that generated 3′ overhangs or double nicking of the same DNA strand (Figure 4D). The ability to create defined overhangs could enable precise insertion of donor repair templates containing compatible overhangs via NHEJ-mediated ligation (Maresca et al., 2013Maresca M. Lin V.G. Guo N. Yang Y. Obligate ligation-gated recombination (ObLiGaRe): custom-designed nuclease-mediated targeted integration through nonhomologous end joining.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To explore this alternative strategy for transgene insertion, we targeted the EMX1 locus with Cas9n and an sgRNA pair designed to generate a 43 bp 5′ overhang near the stop codon and supplied a double-stranded oligonucleotide (dsODN) duplex with matching overhangs (Figure 5A). The annealed dsODN insert, containing multiple epitope tags and a restriction site, was successfully integrated into the target"

Here, we created reporter and conditional mutant mice by coinjection of zygotes with Cas9 mRNA and different guide RNAs (sgRNAs) as well as DNA vectors of different sizes. Using this one-step procedure we generated mice carrying a tag or a fluorescent reporter construct in the Nanog, the Sox2, and the Oct4 gene as well as Mecp2 conditional mutant mice. In addition, using sgRNAs targeting two separate sites in the Mecp2 gene, we produced mice harboring the predicted deletions of about 700 bps.

https://openalex.org/W2105341822,"Iñaki Comas and colleagues report whole-genome sequencing and analysis of 259 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains, providing a survey of global diversity and facilitating evolutionary analyses. Their phylogeographic analysis suggests the emergence of M. tuberculosis complex strains about 70,000 years ago in Africa, with expansion correlated with increased human population density during the Neolithic Demographic Transition. Tuberculosis caused 20% of all human deaths in the Western world between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries and remains a cause of high mortality in developing countries. In analogy to other crowd diseases, the origin of human tuberculosis has been associated with the Neolithic Demographic Transition, but recent studies point to a much earlier origin. We analyzed the whole genomes of 259 M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains and used this data set to characterize global diversity and to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this pathogen. Coalescent analyses indicate that MTBC emerged about 70,000 years ago, accompanied migrations of anatomically modern humans out of Africa and expanded as a consequence of increases in human population density during the Neolithic period. This long coevolutionary history is consistent with MTBC displaying characteristics indicative of adaptation to both low and high host densities."
https://openalex.org/W2038439610,"In this technical report, the authors describe a new, red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin (called red-activatable channelrhodopsin or ReaChR) that shows faster kinetics and greater photocurrents than currently available red-shifted probes. In addition, they show that ReaChR can be activated in awake mice through the intact skull. Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are used to optogenetically depolarize neurons. We engineered a variant of ChR, denoted red-activatable ChR (ReaChR), that is optimally excited with orange to red light (λ ∼590–630 nm) and offers improved membrane trafficking, higher photocurrents and faster kinetics compared to existing red-shifted ChRs. Red light is less scattered by tissue and is absorbed less by blood than the blue to green wavelengths that are required by other ChR variants. We used ReaChR expressed in the vibrissa motor cortex to drive spiking and vibrissa motion in awake mice when excited with red light through intact skull. Precise vibrissa movements were evoked by expressing ReaChR in the facial motor nucleus in the brainstem and illumination with red light through the external auditory canal. Thus, ReaChR enables transcranial optical activation of neurons in deep brain structures without the need to surgically thin the skull, form a transcranial window or implant optical fibers."

The hematopoietic system is maintained all through life by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Hierarchical relationships exist among HSCs, their progeny, and mature blood cells.

MPPs produce Flt3+CD34+KSL lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Månsson R. Buza-Vidas N. Hultquist A. Liuba K. Jensen C.T. Bryder D. Yang L. Borge O.J.

MPPs and LMPPs are considered to be multipotent progenitor cells with limited or no self-renewal activity, that is, allowing only short-term (up to 8 weeks) multilineage repopulation. These multipotent progenitors generate lineage-committed progenitors such as common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M.

Current models accept that HSC self-renewal capability is associated with multipotency and that HSCs lose differentiation potential in a stepwise manner in the process of blood maturation. According to the present “classical” model, hierarchical differentiation proceeds with the first lineage commitment at the MPP stage, giving rise to all mature blood lineages. This model of a multipotent stem cell giving rise to a multipotent progenitor cell has been derived from the hematopoietic system and is commonly proposed as a blueprint for the hierarchy of other stem cell compartments. Despite wide acceptance of this concept, however, evidence from which hierarchical relationships are inferred is somewhat scanty and not definitive. Several recent studies have questioned this scheme of lineage commitment largely because LMPPs with both neutrophil-monocyte and lymphoid potentials, but little or no megakaryocyte-erythroid potential (MkE), have been detected (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J.

Conventional in vivo assays use the Ly5-congenic system to distinguish donor cells from recipient or competitor cells. Because the Ly5 antigen is expressed only on leukocytes, however, clonal and simultaneous analyses of lineage commitment of HSCs to five lineages, including erythrocytes and platelets, have not been reported: erythrocytes and platelets have always been excluded from evaluation for multilineage reconstitution. A transplantation system that can detect five mature blood lineages is required for accurate examination of differentiation potentials of HSCs and progenitor cells. Recently, we showed that CD150highCD34−KSL cells are enriched for myeloid-biased HSCs, which exhibit great self-renewal activity and predominant myeloid reconstitution (Morita et al., 2010Morita Y. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Heterogeneity and hierarchy within the most primitive hematopoietic stem cell compartment.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and that this most primitive HSC compartment contains myeloid-restricted repopulating cells. These results suggested that a first lineage commitment toward myeloid lineage takes place at the level of HSCs. To test this hypothesis, we first developed a transgenic mouse line in which not only T and B cells and neutrophils/monocytes but also erythrocytes and platelets are labeled by Kusabira-Orange (KuO) fluorescent protein, enabling in vivo tracing of five lineages. Using single-cell transplantation of KuO-mouse bone marrow (BM) cells, we found, in the phenotypically defined HSC compartment, long-term repopulating cells with differentiation potential restricted to myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid, or megakaryocyte lineages at a single-cell level (common myeloid repopulating progenitors [CMRPs], megakaryocyte-erythroid repopulating progenitors [MERPs], and megakaryocyte repopulating progenitors [MkRPs]), providing evidence for dissociation of self-renewal capacity from multipotency. To examine whether HSCs directly differentiate into these myeloid-restricted repopulating progenitors (MyRPs), we employed a paired daughter cell (PDC) assay combined with single-cell transplantation. We were able to identify daughter cell pairs in which one was an HSC and the other was an MkRP as well as daughter cell pairs in which one was an HSC and the other was a CMRP, demonstrating that direct lineage commitment took place in an asymmetric manner at the HSC level and that HSCs can directly differentiate into lineage-restricted progenitors without passing through an MPP stage. To analyze all kinds of progeny clonally and simultaneously, we generated a transgenic mouse line in which Kusabira-Orange, encoding red fluorescent protein, is stably expressed in all blood cell lineages, including erythrocytes and platelets (KuO mice; Hamanaka et al., 2013Hamanaka S. Ooehara J. Morita Y. Ema H. Takahashi S. Miyawaki A. Otsu M. Yamaguchi T. Onodera M. Nakauchi H.

Commun. 2013; 435: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This permitted five-lineage clonal tracing of donor-derived blood cells generated after single-cell transplantation, including neutrophils/monocytes (nm), erythrocytes (E), platelets (Plt), B cells (B), and T cells (T). CD150+ cells in the CD34−KSL fraction have long-term and myeloid-biased repopulating activity (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J.

Furthermore, because preliminary work showed that CD41+ cells in the CD150+CD34−KSL fraction mainly reconstituted myeloid cells with somewhat decreased repopulating activity (data not shown), we fractionated the CD34−KSL population into three cohorts comprising CD150+CD41− (fraction I), CD150+CD41+ (fraction II), and CD150−CD41− cells (fraction III) (Figure 1A). We transplanted single cells from these three fractions into a total of 287 lethally irradiated C57BL/6-Ly5.2 (Ly5.2) mice, together with 2 × 105 competitor cells from C57BL/6-Ly5.1/Ly5.2-F1 (Ly5.1/Ly5.2-F1) mice, in four independent experiments (Figure 1B). Chimerism for donor-derived KuO+ cells in nm, E, Plt, B, and T lineages in the peripheral blood (PB) of both primary and secondary recipient mice, as a percentage, was determined periodically (Figure S1 available online).Figure S1Peripheral Blood Analysis after Transplantations, Related to Figure 1Show full captionGating strategy to detect Kusabira-Orange (KuO)+cells among platelets, neutrophils/monocytes, erythrocytes, B cells, or T cells in peripheral blood.

Recipient mice were regarded as reconstituted when at least one type of mature blood lineage contained donor-derived KuO+ cells (0.1% or more) in PB at any time after transplantation. Of the 287 recipient mice, 28 died during follow-up after primary or secondary transplantations, and were eliminated from analyses. Of 259 mice, 130 (50.2%) were reconstituted with single fraction I, fraction II, or fraction III cells. Among the repopulating cells, we found three different types of multilineage repopulating cells. The multilineage repopulating cells were operationally classed as long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), intermediate-term HSCs (IT-HSCs), and short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs) according to the duration and level of multilineage reconstitution (Figure 1C). When all five types of mature blood cells in an individual mouse showed stable chimerism (0.1% or more) 20 weeks after secondary transplantation, the original single cell transplanted into the original recipient mouse (which was also, subsequently, a donor mouse for secondary transplantation) was retrospectively defined as an LT-HSC (Figures 1C, 2A , and S2A ). When five types of mature blood cells in an individual mouse showed chimerism (0.1% or more) 24 weeks after primary transplantation but at least one lineage disappeared in secondary recipient mice, the single cell transplanted into that individual mouse was defined as an IT-HSC (Figures 1C, 2B, and S2B). IT-HSCs in this study may correspond to HSCs described by Benveniste et al. (Benveniste et al., 2010Benveniste P. Frelin C. Janmohamed S. Barbara M. Herrington R. Hyam D. Iscove N.N.

We were surprised to encounter in the phenotypically defined HSC compartment (fractions I, II, and III) progenitor cells functionally equivalent to CMPs, MEPs, and megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs), but with repopulating activity at a single-cell level (CMRPs, MERPs, and MkRPs, respectively; Figures 1C, 2D–2F, and S2D–S2F). CMRPs show nm, E, and Plt reconstitution but not lymphoid reconstitution (B and T lineages). MERPs show only E and Plt reconstitution and MkRPs show only Plt reconstitution. Our description of these lineage-restricted progenitor cells with repopulating activity was enabled by single-cell transplantation analysis and by use of KuO mice, permitting in vivo five-lineage tracing. Surprisingly, 26 of 37 CMRPs (70.3%), 3 of 5 MERPs (60%), and 12 of 22 MkRP (54.5%) exhibited long-term repopulating activity for more than 8 weeks in primary recipients and, in four mice, even in secondary recipients (Figures 2D–F). Although differentiation capacity of the progenitors was restricted, the cells’ self-renewal ability was significant, indicating that multipotency and self-renewal ability were dissociated. In addition, 50 MPPs or LMPPs did not reconstitute nm and Plt more than 8 weeks after transplant (Figures 2G and 2H), indicating that these CMRPs, MERPs, and MkRPs have more repopulating activity than do cells in the CD34+KSL fraction. Of the total 130 reconstituted mice, 46 of 83 mice (55.4%), 39 of 88 mice (44.3%), and 45 of 88 mice (51.1%) were reconstituted with single fraction I, fraction II, and fraction III cells, respectively. LT-HSCs were observed only in recipients of fraction I cells (13 of 83 mice; Figures 3A and 3B ). ST-HSCs were detected in recipients of fraction II and fraction III cells (1 of 88 mice and 25 of 88 mice, respectively) but not in recipients of fraction I cells. In contrast, IT-HSCs were detected in recipient mice of all three populations (8 of 83 mice receiving single fraction I cells, 3 of 88 mice receiving single fraction II cells, and 7 of 88 mice receiving single fraction III cells). Among recipients that showed engraftment, CMRPs were detected in 11 of 46 mice (23.9%), 19 of 39 mice (48.7%), and 7 of 45 mice (15.6%) transplanted with single fraction I, fraction II, and fraction III cells, respectively. MERPs were detected in 3 of 46 mice (6.5%) and 2 of 39 mice (5.1%) transplanted with single fraction I and fraction II cells, respectively, but not in mice transplanted with single fraction III cells. MkRPs were also observed in 11 of 46 mice (23.9%) and 11 of 39 mice (28.2%) transplanted with fraction I and fraction II cells, respectively, but not in mice transplanted with fraction III cells. Fraction II contains more MyRPs than multipotent HSCs, whereas fraction III contains more multipotent HSCs than MyRPs. Unlike myeloid reconstitution, CLP-type reconstitution (by cells showing only B and/or T cell differentiation potentials) was not observed at all in the three fractions tested. In contrast, nmB-type reconstitution was observed in fraction III cells (Figure S3). These results showed that CD150 expression can be used to discriminate MkRPs and MERPs among CD34−KSL cells. In addition, they show that CD41 is a useful marker when purifying or excluding HSCs from CD150+CD34−KSL cells. That the HSC compartment contains MyRPs but not CLP-type progenitors with repopulating ability at a single-cell level suggests that myeloid differentiation is developmentally early, that is, more closely related to HSCs in the development process, than is lymphoid differentiation, an event further downstream. Reconstitution of Plt was observed in 126 of 130 reconstituted mice (96.9%; 4 mice without Plt). Of note is that the four mice without KuO+ Plt reconstitution all had received single fraction III cells (Figure 3B). In addition, Plt reconstitution was always detected first among the five blood lineages in recipient mice, including mice that had received single HSCs (Figures 2 and 3A, and data not shown). Plt chimerism also tended to decrease before that of cells in the other four blood lineages when HSC self-renewal finally ceased. These findings suggest a close relationship between HSCs and megakaryocyte lineages and that Plt reconstitution levels are good indicators of self-renewal potential. To determine the contribution of each repopulating progenitors to BM cells, we analyzed BM cells of LT-HSC-, IT-HSC-, ST-HSC-, CMRP-, and MkRP-recipient mice for KuO+ cells among CD150+CD34−KSL cells (fractions I/II, corresponding to myeloid-biased/balanced HSCs, My-HSCs), CD150−CD34−KSL cells (fraction III, corresponding to lymphoid-biased HSCs, Ly-HSCs), Flt3−CD34+KSL cells (corresponding to MPPs), Flt3+CD34+KSL cells (corresponding to LMPPs), FcγR−CD34+K+S−L− cells (corresponding to CMPs), FcγR−CD34−K+S−L− cells (corresponding to MEPs), FcγR+CD34+K+S−L− cells (corresponding to GMPs), CD150+CD41+K+S−L− (corresponding to MkPs), and IL7Rα+Flt3+KmidSmidL− cells (corresponding to CLPs). As expected, among KuO+ BM cells in three LT-HSC mice, we detected all kinds of phenotypically defined HSCs (fractions I/II and fraction III) and progenitor cells (MPPs and LMPPs; CMPs, MEPs, GMPs, MkPs, and CLPs) (Table 1 and Figure S4A). In four IT-HSC mice, KuO+ hematopoietic cell populations were always detected except among fractions I/II cells and fraction III cells (Table 1 and Figure S4B). Fractions I/II cells and fraction III cells were detected in one of four and two of four mice tested, respectively. On the other hand, in BM cells of ST-HSC mice (n = 4), we did not detect KuO+ cells from fractions I/II and fraction III (Table 1 and Figure S4C). In one of four ST-HSC mice, MPP and LMPP fraction cells were detected. Of importance is that in CMRP mice (n = 3), KuO+ fraction III cells, LMPP fraction cells, and CLPs, the fractions thought to tend to produce lymphoid lineages in BM cells, were never detected. KuO+ fractions I/II cells were detected in BM of CMRP mice (n = 2) transplanted with single fraction I cells at 24 weeks after transplant (Figure S4D). However, in a CMRP mouse with a tendency toward decreasing chimerism, KuO+ fractions I/II cells were not detected (n = 1, Table 1; and data not shown). Similarly, in MkRP mice we did not detect KuO+ fraction III cells, LMPP fraction cells, GMPs, or CLPs, whereas fractions I/II cells and MPP fraction cells were detected in three of four mice (Table 1 and Figure S4E).Table 1BM Populations Reconstituted by Single LT-HSCs, IT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, CMRPs, and MkRPsTest CellsPresence in BM of Phenotypically Defined Populations Derived from Single KuO+ Donor CellsMy-HSCLy-HSCMPPLMPPCMPMEPGMPMkPCLPFractions I/IIFraction IIILT-HSC3/33/33/33/33/33/33/33/33/3IT-HSC1/42/44/44/44/44/44/44/44/4ST-HSC0/40/41/41/42/42/42/42/43/4CMRP2/30/33/30/33/33/31/33/30/3MkRP3/40/43/40/42/43/40/43/40/4The presence in BM of phenotypically defined populations derived from single KuO+ donor cells was assessed.

https://openalex.org/W1982281628,"Intracellular proteins with long lifespans have recently been linked to age-dependent defects, ranging from decreased fertility to the functional decline of neurons. Why long-lived proteins exist in metabolically active cellular environments and how they are maintained over time remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a system-wide identification of proteins with exceptional lifespans in the rat brain. These proteins are inefficiently replenished despite being translated robustly throughout adulthood. Using nucleoporins as a paradigm for long-term protein persistence, we found that nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are maintained over a cell's life through slow but finite exchange of even its most stable subcomplexes. This maintenance is limited, however, as some nucleoporin levels decrease during aging, providing a rationale for the previously observed age-dependent deterioration of NPC function. Our identification of a long-lived proteome reveals cellular components that are at increased risk for damage accumulation, linking long-term protein persistence to the cellular aging process.

https://openalex.org/W2107823533,"Like all cancers, brain tumors require a continuous source of energy and molecular resources for new cell production. In normal brain, glucose is an essential neuronal fuel, but the blood-brain barrier limits its delivery. We now report that nutrient restriction contributes to tumor progression by enriching for brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) owing to preferential BTIC survival and to adaptation of non-BTICs through acquisition of BTIC features. BTICs outcompete for glucose uptake by co-opting the high affinity neuronal glucose transporter, type 3 (Glut3, SLC2A3). BTICs preferentially express Glut3, and targeting Glut3 inhibits BTIC growth and tumorigenic potential. Glut3, but not Glut1, correlates with poor survival in brain tumors and other cancers; thus, tumor initiating cells may extract nutrients with high affinity. As altered metabolism represents a cancer hallmark, metabolic reprogramming may maintain the tumor hierarchy and portend poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2110150994,"Maha Farhat, Megan Murray and colleagues report whole-genome sequencing of 116 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains selected to be representative of both global diversity and drug resistance. The authors develop a new method to search for resistance markers in microbial genomes based on reconstructing a genome-wide phylogeny and identifying regions showing convergent evolution, and they use this method to identify 39 new candidate drug resistance regions in the M. tuberculosis genome. M. tuberculosis is evolving antibiotic resistance, threatening attempts at tuberculosis epidemic control. Mechanisms of resistance, including genetic changes favored by selection in resistant isolates, are incompletely understood. Using 116 newly sequenced and 7 previously sequenced M. tuberculosis whole genomes, we identified genome-wide signatures of positive selection specific to the 47 drug-resistant strains. By searching for convergent evolution—the independent fixation of mutations in the same nucleotide position or gene—we recovered 100% of a set of known resistance markers. We also found evidence of positive selection in an additional 39 genomic regions in resistant isolates. These regions encode components in cell wall biosynthesis, transcriptional regulation and DNA repair pathways. Mutations in these regions could directly confer resistance or compensate for fitness costs associated with resistance. Functional genetic analysis of mutations in one gene, ponA1, demonstrated an in vitro growth advantage in the presence of the drug rifampicin."
https://openalex.org/W2116910749,"How organ-specific metastatic traits arise in primary tumors remains unknown. Here, we show a role of the breast tumor stroma in selecting cancer cells that are primed for metastasis in bone. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in triple-negative (TN) breast tumors skew heterogeneous cancer cell populations toward a predominance of clones that thrive on the CAF-derived factors CXCL12 and IGF1. Limiting concentrations of these factors select for cancer cells with high Src activity, a known clinical predictor of bone relapse and an enhancer of PI3K-Akt pathway activation by CXCL12 and IGF1. Carcinoma clones selected in this manner are primed for metastasis in the CXCL12-rich microenvironment of the bone marrow. The evidence suggests that stromal signals resembling those of a distant organ select for cancer cells that are primed for metastasis in that organ, thus illuminating the evolution of metastatic traits in a primary tumor and its distant metastases."

The growth of cancerous prostate cells requires stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR) by androgens, the most potent of which is dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Advanced prostate cancer usually initially regresses with gonadal testosterone (T) deprivation therapy (i.e., medical or surgical castration), but it almost always eventually progresses as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Attard et al., 2009Attard G.

The requirement for intratumoral androgen synthesis in driving CRPC progression is most clearly demonstrated by the survival benefit conferred by abiraterone acetate, a drug that blocks androgen synthesis by inhibiting 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), and enzalutamide, a potent AR antagonist that blocks DHT access to the AR ligand-binding domain (Barrie et al., 1994Barrie S.E.

Intratumoral synthesis of DHT from precursors that are secreted from the adrenal gland occurs through a pathway that circumvents T (Chang et al., 2011Chang K.H. Li R. Papari-Zareei M. Watumull L.

This synthesis requires three enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD; encoded by HSD3B), steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) isoenzymes (see Figure 1A) (Chang et al., 2011Chang K.H.

Nonetheless, increased DHT synthesis in CRPC has not yet been ascribed to any mutations in genes encoding components of the steroidogenic machinery. 3βHSD oxidizes 3β-hydroxyl to 3-keto and isomerizes Δ5 to Δ4 (see Figure 1A), reactions that together make this step practically irreversible by an enzyme that is required for all possible pathways that lead to the synthesis of DHT (Evaul et al., 2010Evaul K. Li R. Papari-Zareei M. Auchus R.J. Sharifi N. 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is a possible pharmacological target in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.Endocrinology. 2010; 151: 3514-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HSD3B1 encodes for the peripherally expressed isoenzyme (3βHSD1) and has a germline single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 1245 of HSD3B1, converting A → C, which exchanges an asparagine (N) for a threonine (T) at 3βHSD1 amino acid position 367. Here, we show that CRPC sometimes expresses the 367T form of 3βHSD1 (3βHSD1(367T)), which increases metabolic flux from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) via the 5α-androstanedione (5α-dione) pathway to DHT by protein resistance to ubiquitination and degradation rather than increased catalytic activity. Selection for 3βHSD1(367T) is evident from somatic mutation in human CRPC tumors, by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type copy in patients with germline heterozygous inheritance, and from the generation and expression of the same somatic mutation occurring in a mouse xenograft model treated with abiraterone acetate. Conversion of DHEA by 3βHSD1 to Δ4-androstenedione (AD) is a proximal step in peripheral tissues for metabolism from adrenal precursors to DHT (Lorence et al., 1990Lorence M.C. Murry B.A. Trant J.M.

Rev. 2005; 26: 525-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Two cell lines derived from patients with CRPC have widely disparate flux from DHEA to AD (Figure 1A), despite comparable expression of transcripts encoding both 3βHSD1 and 3βHSD2 (Figure S1A available online). Under the same conditions, LNCaP cells metabolize >90% of [3H]-DHEA by 3βHSD enzymatic activity to AD after 48 hr, whereas LAPC4 cells metabolize only approximately 10% of [3H]-DHEA. In LAPC4, but not in LNCaP, apparent rate-limiting conversion of DHEA to AD, en route to DHT via the dominant pathway (DHEA → AD → 5α-dione → DHT) (Chang et al., 2011Chang K.H. Li R. Papari-Zareei M. Watumull L. Zhao Y.D. Auchus R.J. Sharifi N. Dihydrotestosterone synthesis bypasses testosterone to drive castration-resistant prostate cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 13728-13733Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), is further evident by limited accumulation of downstream metabolites and absence of DHEA concentration-dependent increases in AR-regulated PSA and TMPRSS2 (Figure 1B). Sequencing the exons of both HSD3B isoenzymes reveals a single nonsynonymous substitution (Figure 1C) at position 1245 of HSD3B1, converting A → C, and exchanges an asparagine (N) for a threonine (T) at 3βHSD1 amino acid position 367 in LNCaP, but not in LAPC4. To further test the association between HSD3B1 sequence and steroid metabolism, other human prostate cell lines were investigated. The presence of wild-type (1245A) and variant (1245C) HSD3B1 sequences in other prostate cancer and immortalized prostate cell lines is also concordant with “slow” and “fast” flux from DHEA to AD, respectively (Figure S1B). The kinetic properties of recombinant 3βHSD1(367N) and 3βHSD1(367T) proteins, however, do not explain the differences in steroid metabolism between cells expressing each protein (Figure 1D). Western blot was performed to determine if the allele encoding 3βHSD1(367T) is associated with a greater amount of protein in these cells. Both models that encode for 3βHSD1(367T) have increased 3βHSD1 protein compared with the models that have wild-type sequence (Figure 1E). The HSD3B1(1245C); 3βHSD1(367T) allele occurs as a germline SNP variant (rs1047303; 22% allele frequency) (Shimodaira et al., 2010Shimodaira M. Nakayama T. Sato N. Aoi N. Sato M. Izumi Y. Soma M.

Endocrinol. 2010; 163: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but might also occur as a somatic mutation in prostate cancer. Although germline homozygous HSD3B1(1245C) inheritance cannot be ruled out, the most likely scenarios accounting for the sole presence of the HSD3B1(1245C) allele evident in both LNCaP and VCaP, given the low expected frequency of homozygous HSD3B1(1245C) inheritance, are either germline heterozygous inheritance followed by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele or germline homozygous wild-type inheritance followed by somatic mutation of 1245 A → C. To identify the existence of these possible mechanisms of HSD3B1(1245C) selection in human tumors, matching germline and tumor DNA were sequenced from men with CRPC. Genomic DNA was isolated from CRPC and normal tissue from patients treated at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and from the University of Washington (UW) rapid autopsy program (Montgomery et al., 2008Montgomery R.B. Mostaghel E.A. Vessella R. Hess D.L. Kalhorn T.F. Higano C.S. True L.D. Nelson P.S.

Patient and tumor characteristics are available in Table S1. Of 40 men with CRPC, the germline of 25, 11, and 4 individuals is homozygous wild-type HSD3B1(1245A), heterozygous and homozygous variant HSD3B1(1245C), respectively. Three of 25 (12%) CRPC tumors with homozygous HSD3B1(1245A) inheritance have acquired the HSD3B1(1245C) allele (Figure 2A). Expression of HSD3B1(1245C) transcript was confirmed in the one available fresh-frozen tumor. It is highly likely that the observation of three identical de novo mutations occurring in 25 patients is due to selection rather than chance alone, with a high degree of statistical significance (p = 1.47 × 10−13), using the binomial method and assuming a mutation rate of 4 per 1,000,000 base pairs (Greenman et al., 2007Greenman C. Stephens P. Smith R. Dalgliesh G.L. Hunter C. Bignell G. Davies H. Teague J. Butler A. Stevens C. et al.Patterns of somatic mutation in human cancer genomes.Nature. 2007; 446: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar). Of 11 CRPC tumors with heterozygous inheritance, three (27%) have LOH of the HSD3B1(1245A) allele, resulting in the HSD3B1(1245C) allele being predominantly detectable (Figure 2B). In these three tumors, LOH of adjacent heterozygous SNPs further confirms loss of this region of chromosome 1. In contrast, none of the 11 cases with heterozygous inheritance exhibited LOH of the HSD3B1(1245C) allele (Figure S2A).Figure S2HSD3B1 LOH in Human CRPC Tissues, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) LOH of the HSD3B1(1245C) allele encoding 3βHSD1(367T) does not occur in CRPC.

(B) HSD3B1 mRNA expression in UW tumors with LOH does not explain elevated 3βHSD1 protein expression. Expression is normalized to RPLP0 and error bars represent the SD from experiments performed in triplicate. Two tumors (UW9 and UW25) with LOH of the HSD3B1(1245A) allele had tissue remaining for additional studies. Consistent with the findings in LNCaP and VCaP that only have the HSD3B1(1245C) allele, both of these tumors have abundant detectable 3βHSD1 protein (Figure 2C). In contrast, both tumors tested with heterozygous expression and homozygous HSD3B1(1245A) expression have little or no detectable 3βHSD1. Messenger RNA (mRNA) quantitation by qRT-PCR demonstrates that the increased 3βHSD1 protein abundance occurring specifically in the tumors with LOH is not attributable to transcript overexpression (Figure S2B). Both tumors with LOH robustly express AR and PSA, suggesting that flux to DHT sustained by 3βHSD1 protein functions to elicit AR signaling (Figure 2C). Abiraterone inhibits CYP17A1 and weakly inhibits 3βHSD, further decreasing intratumoral androgen concentrations and extending survival in CRPC (de Bono et al., 2011de Bono J.S. Logothetis C.J.

To determine if abiraterone treatment selects for the HSD3B1(1245C) allele, genomic DNA from LAPC4 xenograft tumors grown in orchiectomized mice treated with abiraterone or vehicle (n = 8 mice per treatment) was isolated and sequenced (Li et al., 2012Li R. Evaul K. Sharma K.K. Chang K.-H. Yoshimoto J. Liu J. Auchus R.J. Sharifi N. Abiraterone inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase: a rationale for increasing drug exposure in castration-resistant prostate cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 3571-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 1245C allele is detectable in 2 of 8 tumors (Abi #1 and Abi #2) in the abiraterone treatment group and no tumors in the vehicle group (Figure 2D). To confirm expression of the somatically acquired mutation in the abiraterone group, complementary DNA (cDNA) clones were generated and sequenced. The mutant HSD3B1(1245C) transcript encoding for 3βHSD1(367T) is confirmed in 12 of 21 (57%) cDNA clones sequenced from Abi #1 and 7 of 26 (27%) clones from Abi #2. In contrast, the mutant transcript is not present in any of the 37 cDNA clones obtained from two vehicle-treated LAPC4 xenograft tumors. To determine the role of 3βHSD1(367T) expression in regulating flux from DHEA to DHT and AR stimulation, endogenous expression was silenced in LNCaP using two independent lentiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Figure 3A). Blocking 3βHSD1 expression with both shRNAs inhibits flux from DHEA to AD, resulting in little or no detectable conversion to downstream 5α-dione and DHT (Figure 3B). Silencing expression of mutant 3βHSD1 and blocking flux to DHT impedes the expression of AR-regulated PSA and TMPRSS2 (Figure 3C), leading to inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro (Figure 3D). In vivo, depletion of endogenously expressed mutant 3βHSD1 significantly hinders CRPC growth in surgically orchiectomized mice (Figure 3E). CRPC tumors that eventually develop from cell lines initially expressing lentiviral shRNA knockdown constructs regain 3βHSD1 protein, probably from selection for cells that have lost the shRNA construct (Figure 3F). Endogenous expression of 3βHSD1(367T) appears to engender increased protein abundance compared to expression of 3βHSD1(367N) (Figure 1E). To determine if the underlying mechanism is due to an alteration in protein degradation, wild-type (HSD3B1(N)-HA) and (HSD3B1(T)-HA) constructs were generated and transiently expressed, and protein levels were compared following inhibition of translation with cycloheximide (CHX) treatment. The 367 N → T mutation substantially increases protein half-life from 2.1 to 27 hr (Figure 4A). Similar experiments with an alternative prostate cancer cell line (Figure S3A) and with stable expression of lentiviral constructs confirm the longer half-life of 3βHSD1(367T) (Figure S3B). To determine whether increased degradation of wild-type protein is reversible with proteasome inhibition, cells were treated with MG132. Pharmacologic proteasome inhibition increases endogenous wild-type 3βHSD1(367N) in LAPC4 but does not increase 3βHSD1(367T) in LNCaP (Figure 4B), and polyubiquitinated endogenous 3βHSD1(367N) accumulates with MG132 treatment in LAPC4 (Figure 4C). In contrast, polyubiquitinated endogenous 3βHSD1(367T) is not increased in LNCaP with MG132 treatment (Figure S3C). A direct comparison of ubiquitination between HA-tagged wild-type and mutant protein by Ni-agarose pull-down demonstrates that 3βHSD1(367T) is resistant to polyubiquitination (Figure 4D), explaining decreased vulnerability to proteasome-mediated degradation and longer protein half-life.Figure S3Protein Half-Life of 3βHSD1(367T) and 3βHSD1(367N), Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) HA-tagged 3βHSD1(367T) (T-HA) has a prolonged half-life compared to wild-type 3βHSD1(367N) (N-HA) protein in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line.

We employed mass spectrometry to determine the lysine residue(s) ubiquitinated on 3βHSD1(367N). Ubiquitination is detectable on both K70 (Figure 5A) and K352 (Figure 5B) of 3βHSD1(367N). The effects of K352R and K70R single mutations and a double mutation on ubiquitination were assessed by Ni-agarose pull-down (Figure 5C). K352 appears to be a more critical site of ubiquitination than does K70, and mutation of both sites decreases ubiquitination greater than does either mutation alone. Autocrine mobility factor receptor (AMFR, also known as gp78) is a membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase that functions through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway (Song et al., 2005Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Gp78, a membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase, associates with Insig-1 and couples sterol-regulated ubiquitination to degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Mol.

Eeyarestatin I (EerI) is a small molecule that inhibits protein degradation through the ERAD pathway (Wang et al., 2008Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y.

USA. 2009; 106: 2200-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Endogenous 3βHSD1(367N) protein increases in LAPC4 cells with EerI treatment, suggesting that the ERAD pathway is required for 3βHSD1(367N) degradation (Figure 5D). Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to identify candidate ubiquitin ligases in an unbiased manner that preferentially associate with 3βHSD1(367N) (Ong et al., 2002Ong S.E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SILAC, as a simple and accurate approach to expression proteomics.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). In this experiment, cells expressing 3βHSD1(367T)-HA and 3βHSD1(367N)-HA were grown in light and heavy media, respectively. AMFR was detected with a normalized protein ratio of 1.67 (derived from peptide ratios varying ≤17%) in a mixture of 3βHSD1(367N)-HA and 3βHSD1(367T)-HA immunoprecipitations mixed in a 1:1 ratio, indicating preferential physical association with 3βHSD1(367N) protein. Immunoprecipitation of 3βHSD1(367N)-HA and 3βHSD1(367T)-HA, followed by AMFR immunoblot, confirms a preferential physical association of AMFR with 3βHSD1(367N) protein (Figure 5E). To assess the functional consequence of this interaction, AMFR was silenced using siRNA (Figure 5F). AMFR knockdown increases the abundance of 3βHSD1 protein, demonstrating the requirement of AMFR for 3βHSD1 degradation through the ERAD pathway. In contrast, silencing the alternative ubiquitin ligase SKP2 by siRNA had no detectable effect on 3βHSD1. To determine if resistance to protein ubiquitination and degradation ascribed to 3βHSD1(367T) confers increased synthesis of DHT from precursor steroids, we expressed constructs that encode for 3βHSD1(367N), 3βHSD1(367T), or vector alone in LAPC4 cells and assessed metabolic flux from [3H]-DHEA to downstream steroids. LAPC4 cells transiently transfected with the construct encoding for 3βHSD1(367T) exhibit increased flux from DHEA → AD → 5α-dione → DHT (Figure 6A). Equivalent expression of both transcripts was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 6B). Stable lentiviral expression of 3βHSD1(367T) similarly confers increased flux from DHEA → AD → 5α-dione → DHT (Figure 6C), with transcript expression comparable to wild-type transcript expression (Figure 6D). Finally, we determined that the 3βHSD1(367T) phenotype that accelerates flux from DHEA to DHT amplifies the response of androgen-regulated gene expression (Figure 6E) and hastens the time to the development of CRPC xenograft tumors (Figure 6F) in orchiectomized mice supplemented with DHEA to mimic human adrenal physiology. 3βHSD1(367T) tumors express higher levels of PSA transcript compared to 3βHSD1(367N) tumors, suggesting the presence of higher sustained DHT concentrations generated in 3βHSD1(367T) tumors (Figure 6G). Together, these findings support a mechanism that favors genetic selection for the allele encoding 3βHSD1(367T) in the setting of androgen depletion.

https://openalex.org/W2033185023,"Although RAF kinases are critical for controlling cell growth, their mechanism of activation is incompletely understood. Recently, dimerization was shown to be important for activation. Here we show that the dimer is functionally asymmetric with one kinase functioning as an activator to stimulate activity of the partner, receiver kinase. The activator kinase did not require kinase activity but did require N-terminal phosphorylation that functioned allosterically to induce cis-autophosphorylation of the receiver kinase. Based on modeling of the hydrophobic spine assembly, we also engineered a constitutively active mutant that was independent of Ras, dimerization, and activation-loop phosphorylation. As N-terminal phosphorylation of BRAF is constitutive, BRAF initially functions to activate CRAF. N-terminal phosphorylation of CRAF was dependent on MEK, suggesting a feedback mechanism and explaining a key difference between BRAF and CRAF. Our work illuminates distinct steps in RAF activation that function to assemble the active conformation of the RAF kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2137499975,"Eukaryotic genomes generate a heterogeneous ensemble of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs and mRNAs are both transcribed by Pol II and acquire 5' caps and poly(A) tails, but only mRNAs are translated into proteins. To address how these classes are distinguished, we identified the transcriptome-wide targets of 13 RNA processing, export, and turnover factors in budding yeast. Comparing the maturation pathways of mRNAs and lncRNAs revealed that transcript fate is largely determined during 3' end formation. Most lncRNAs are targeted for nuclear RNA surveillance, but a subset with 3' cleavage and polyadenylation features resembling the mRNA consensus can be exported to the cytoplasm. The Hrp1 and Nab2 proteins act at this decision point, with dual roles in mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation and lncRNA surveillance. Our data also reveal the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of mRNA maturation, and highlight a subset of ""lncRNA-like"" mRNAs regulated by the nuclear surveillance machinery."

They also find that IL-17 induces apoptosis of NG2+ cells in an Act1-dependent manner. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a signature cytokine of Th17 cells. We previously reported that deletion of NF-κB activator 1 (Act1), the key transducer of IL-17 receptor signaling, from the neuroectodermal lineage in mice (neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) results in attenuated severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here we examined the cellular basis of this observation. EAE disease course was unaffected by deletion of Act1 in neurons or mature oligodendrocytes, and Act1 deletion in astrocytes only modestly affected disease course. Deletion of Act1 in NG2+ glia resulted in markedly reduced EAE severity. Furthermore, IL-17 induced characteristic inflammatory mediator expression in NG2+ glial cells. IL-17 also exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in vitro and reduced their survival. These data identify NG2+ glia as the major CNS cellular target of IL-17 in EAE. The sensitivity of oligodendrocyte lineage cells to IL-17–mediated toxicity further suggests a direct link between inflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2156902902,"Retinal photoreceptors entrain the circadian system to the solar day. This photic resetting involves cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated upregulation of Per genes within individual cells of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Our detailed understanding of this pathway is poor, and it remains unclear why entrainment to a new time zone takes several days. By analyzing the light-regulated transcriptome of the SCN, we have identified a key role for salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in clock re-setting. An entrainment stimulus causes CRTC1 to coactivate CREB, inducing the expression of Per1 and Sik1. SIK1 then inhibits further shifts of the clock by phosphorylation and deactivation of CRTC1. Knockdown of Sik1 within the SCN results in increased behavioral phase shifts and rapid re-entrainment following experimental jet lag. Thus SIK1 provides negative feedback, acting to suppress the effects of light on the clock. This pathway provides a potential target for the regulation of circadian rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W1975404749,"To examine the nature of information encoded by prefrontal output signals, the authors simultaneously recorded neuronal activity in monkey prefrontal and parietal cortices during a rule-based spatial categorization task. They found that signals reflecting rule-dependent categories were selectively transmitted from prefrontal to parietal neurons. Prefrontal cortex influences behavior largely through its connections with other association cortices; however, the nature of the information conveyed by prefrontal output signals and what effect these signals have on computations performed by target structures is largely unknown. To address these questions, we simultaneously recorded the activity of neurons in prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices of monkeys performing a rule-based spatial categorization task. Parietal cortex receives direct prefrontal input, and parietal neurons, like their prefrontal counterparts, exhibit signals that reflect rule-based cognitive processing in this task. By analyzing rapid fluctuations in the cognitive information encoded by activity in the two areas, we obtained evidence that signals reflecting rule-dependent categories were selectively transmitted in a top-down direction from prefrontal to parietal neurons, suggesting that prefrontal output is important for the executive control of distributed cognitive processing."
https://openalex.org/W2053563225,"Failure to develop complete dentition, tooth agenesis, is a common developmental anomaly manifested most often as isolated but also as associated with many developmental syndromes.

We identified 28 mutations, 17 of which were novel. Together with our previous reports, we have identified two mutations in MSX1, AXIN2 and EDARADD, five in PAX9, four in EDA and EDAR, and nine in WNT10A. They were observed in 58 probands (44%), with a mean number of missing teeth of 11.7 (range 4 to 34). Almost all of these probands had severe agenesis. Only few of the probands but several relatives with heterozygous genotypes of WNT10A or EDAR conformed to the common type of non-syndromic tooth agenesis, incisor-premolar hypodontia. Mutations in MSX1 and PAX9 affected predominantly posterior teeth, whereas both deciduous and permanent incisors were especially sensitive to mutations in EDA and EDAR. Many mutations in EDAR, EDARADD and WNT10A were present in several families.

Murine primary macrophages treated with HDL showed increased gene expression for the M2 markers Arginase-1 (Arg-1) and Fizz-1, which are classically induced by IL-4. HDL was able to potentiate the IL-4-induced changes in Arg-1, and tended to do the same for Fizz-1, while suppressing the expression of inflammatory genes in response to IFNγ. The effects of either IL-4 or HDL were suppressed when macrophages were from STAT6(-/-) mice, but inhibitor studies suggested differential utilization of JAK isoforms by IL-4 and HDL to activate STAT6 by phosphorylation. Overall, our results describe a new function of HDL, namely its ability to directly enrich macrophages in markers of the M2, anti-inflammatory, state in a process requiring STAT6."

Here, we show that the endo-siRNA pathway promotes odor adaptation in C. elegans AWC olfactory neurons. In adaptation, the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3, which acts in AWC, is loaded with siRNAs targeting odr-1, a gene whose downregulation is required for adaptation. Concomitant with increased odr-1 siRNA in AWC, we observe increased binding of the HP1 homolog HPL-2 at the odr-1 locus in AWC and reduced odr-1 mRNA in adapted animals. Phosphorylation of HPL-2, an in vitro substrate of the EGL-4 kinase that promotes adaption, is necessary and sufficient for behavioral adaptation. Thus, environmental stimulation amplifies an endo-siRNA negative feedback loop to dynamically repress cognate gene expression and shape behavior. This class of siRNA may act broadly as a rheostat allowing prolonged stimulation to dampen gene expression and promote cellular memory formation. PAPERFLICK:"
https://openalex.org/W2076749272,"DNA damage triggers polyubiquitylation and degradation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), a ""mechanism of last resort"" employed during transcription stress. In yeast, this process is dependent on Def1 through a previously unresolved mechanism. Here, we report that Def1 becomes activated through ubiquitylation- and proteasome-dependent processing. Def1 processing results in the removal of a domain promoting cytoplasmic localization, resulting in nuclear accumulation of the clipped protein. Nuclear Def1 then binds RNAPII, utilizing a ubiquitin-binding domain to recruit the Elongin-Cullin E3 ligase complex via a ubiquitin-homology domain in the Ela1 protein. This facilitates polyubiquitylation of Rpb1, triggering its proteasome-mediated degradation. Together, these results outline the multistep mechanism of Rpb1 polyubiquitylation triggered by transcription stress and uncover the key role played by Def1 as a facilitator of Elongin-Cullin ubiquitin ligase function."

Participants encoded object-based and scene-based associations and then restudied them either after a “long” or “short” delay during which consolidation could occur. We found that BOLD activation in left PRC and hippocampal-PRC functional connectivity were significantly enhanced during the restudy of the long versus short delay word-object pairs. Secondly, hippocampal-PRC connectivity during restudy of the long delay word-object pairs predicted a subsequent reduction in associative forgetting. By contrast, hippocampal-PRC connectivity did not predict subsequent resistance to forgetting for the short delay or novel associations. Together, these results provide evidence for perirhinal-hippocampal interactions in the selective consolidation of object-based associative memories and provide support for the notion that, during early stages of consolidation, memories become more distributed across brain regions."

Here we identify connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as a critical factor in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) in determining the efficiency of incorporation of postnatally born inhibitory neurons, thus gating the output of glomeruli, the first relay station of olfactory processing in the brain. In the OB, CTGF expression was restricted to prenatally born external tufted cells. CTGF enhanced the proapoptotic activity of glial-derived TGF-β2, decreasing the survival of periglomerular inhibitory neurons. Changes in CTGF expression levels in the OB led to modifications in local neuronal circuitry and olfactory behaviors. We show that the odorant-specific recruitment of distinct glomeruli resulted in enhanced local CTGF expression levels in the activated glomeruli. Collectively our data reveal a molecular mechanism controlling the survival of defined postnatally born neurons, thus adapting neuronal integration to the sensory experiences."

Despite loss of kinematic tuning, cells in the globus pallidus (63%, 10/16 cells) and VLo (84%, 46/55 cells) still responded to one or more aspects of joint movement during GP-DBS. Further, modulated kinematic tuning did not always necessitate modulation in firing patterns (2/12 cells in globus pallidus; 13/23 cells in VLo), and regularized firing patterns did not always correspond to altered responses to joint articulation (3/4 cells in globus pallidus, 11/33 cells in VLo).

Further, early neoplasia observed in infected ApcMin/+ mice was transmissible to uninfected mice by intraperitoneal injection of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells alone from H. hepaticus-infected mutant mice. Transmissibility of neoplasia was preventable by prior neutralization of inflammation using anti-TNF-α antibody in infected MLN donor mice.

https://openalex.org/W2111401071,"Mitochondria contain a 16.6 kb circular genome encoding 13 proteins as well as mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs. Copies of the genome are organized into nucleoids containing both DNA and proteins, including the machinery required for mtDNA replication and transcription. The transcription factor TFAM is critical for initiation of transcription and replication of the genome, and is also thought to perform a packaging function. Although specific binding sites required for initiation of transcription have been identified in the D-loop, little is known about the characteristics of TFAM binding in its nonspecific packaging state. In addition, it is unclear whether TFAM also plays a role in the regulation of nuclear gene expression. Here we investigate these questions by using ChIP-seq to directly localize TFAM binding to DNA in human cells. Our results demonstrate that TFAM uniformly coats the whole mitochondrial genome, with no evidence of robust TFAM binding to the nuclear genome. Our study represents the first high-resolution assessment of TFAM binding on a genome-wide scale in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059500112,"Complement factor H (fH) is a plasma protein that regulates activation of the alternative pathway, and mutations in fH are associated with a rare form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). A more common TMA is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is caused by the lack of normal ADAMTS-13-mediated cleavage of von Willebrand factor (VWF). We investigated whether fH interacts with VWF and affects cleavage of VWF. We found that factor H binds to VWF in plasma, to plasma-purified VWF, and to recombinant A1 and A2 domains of VWF as detected by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and surface plasmon resonance assays. Factor H enhanced ADAMTS-13-mediated cleavage of recombinant VWF-A2 as determined by quantifying the cleavage products using Western-blotting, enhanced cleavage of a commercially available fragment of VWF-A2 (FRETS-VWF73) as determined by fluorometric assay, and enhanced cleavage of ultralarge (UL) VWF under flow conditions as determined by cleavage of VWF-platelet strings attached to histamine stimulated endothelial cells. Using recombinant full-length and truncated fH molecules, we found that the presence of the C-terminal half of fH molecule is important for binding to VWF-A2 and for enhancing cleavage of the A2 domain by ADAMTS-13. We conclude that factor H binds to VWF and may modulate cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS-13."

The purpose of the study was to investigate the in vitro effect of LBH589 alone and in combination with RT on the growth and survival of CaP cell lines and the possible mechanisms of radiosensitization of this combination therapy. The effect of LBH589 alone or in combination with RT on two CaP cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) and a normal prostatic epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) was studied by MTT and clonogenic assays, cell cycle analysis, western blotting of apoptosis-related and cell check point proteins, and DNA double strand break (DSB) repair markers. The immunofluorescence staining was used to further confirm DSB expression in treated CaP cells. Our results indicate that LBH589 inhibited proliferation in both CaP and normal prostatic epithelial cells in a time-and-dose-dependent manner; low-dose of LBH589 (IC20) combined with RT greatly improved efficiency of cell killing in CaP cells; compared to RT alone, the combination treatment with LBH589 and RT induced more apoptosis and led to a steady increase of sub-G1 population and abolishment of RT-induced G2/M arrest, increased and persistent DSB, less activation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)/homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways and a panel of cell cycle related proteins. These results suggest that LBH589 is a potential agent to increase radiosensitivity of human CaP cells. LBH589 used either alone, or in combination with RT is an attractive strategy for treating human CaP."
https://openalex.org/W2161444985,"Following DNA replication, eukaryotic cells must biorient all sister chromatids prior to cohesion cleavage at anaphase. In animal cells, sister chromatids gradually biorient during prometaphase, but current models of mitosis in S. cerevisiae assume that biorientation is established shortly after S phase. This assumption is based on the observation of a bilobed distribution of yeast kinetochores early in mitosis and suggests fundamental differences between yeast mitosis and mitosis in animal cells. By applying super-resolution imaging methods, we show that yeast and animal cells share the key property of gradual and stochastic chromosome biorientation. The characteristic bilobed distribution of yeast kinetochores, hitherto considered synonymous for biorientation, arises from kinetochores in mixed attachment states to microtubules, the length of which discriminates bioriented from syntelic attachments. Our results offer a revised view of mitotic progression in S. cerevisiae that augments the relevance of mechanistic information obtained in this powerful genetic system for mammalian mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1985315670,"Background Hypercholesterolemia plays a critical role in atherosclerosis. CD34+ CD45dim Lineage- hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) give rise to the inflammatory cells linked to atherosclerosis. In mice, high cholesterol levels mobilize HSPCs into the bloodstream, and promote their differentiation to granulocytes and monocytes. The objective of our study was to determine how cholesterol levels affect HSPC quantity in humans. Methods We performed a blinded, randomized hypothesis generating study in human subjects (n=12) treated sequentially with statins of differing potencies to vary lipid levels. CD34+ HSPC levels in blood were measured by flow cytometry. Hematopoietic colony forming assays confirmed the CD34+ population studied as HSPCs with multlineage differentiation potential. Mobilizing cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. Results The quantity of HSPCs was 0.15 ± 0.1% of buffy coat leukocytes. We found a weak, positive correlation between CD34+ HSPCs and both total and LDL cholesterol levels (r2=0.096, p < 0.025). Additionally, we tested whether cholesterol modulates CD34+ HSPCs through direct effects or on the levels of mobilizing cytokines. LDL cholesterol increased cell surface expression of CXCR4, G-CSFR affecting HSPC migration, and CD47 mediating protection from phagocytosis by immune cells. LDL cholesterol also increased proliferation of CD34+ HSPCs (28 ± 5.7%, n=6, p < 0.03). Finally, the HSPC mobilizing cytokine G-CSF (r2=0.0683, p < 0.05), and its upstream regulator IL-17 (r2=0.0891, p < 0.05) both correlated positively with LDL cholesterol, while SDF-1 levels were not significantly affected. Conclusions Our findings support a model where LDL cholesterol levels positively correlate with CD34+ HSPC levels in humans through effects on the levels of G-CSF via IL-17 promoting mobilization of HSPCs, and by direct effects of LDL cholesterol on HSPC proliferation. The findings are provocative of further study to determine if HSPCs, like cholesterol levels, are linked to CVD events."
https://openalex.org/W2041590388,"Spontaneous antenatal hypoxia is associated with high risk of adverse outcomes, however, there is little information on neural adaptation to labor-like insults. Chronically instrumented near-term sheep fetuses (125 ± 3 days, mean ± SEM) with baseline PaO2 < 17 mmHg (hypoxic group: n = 8) or > 17 mmHg (normoxic group: n = 8) received 1-minute umbilical cord occlusions repeated every 5 minutes for a total of 4 hours, or until mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) fell below 20 mmHg for two successive occlusions. 5/8 fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia were unable to complete the full series of occlusions (vs. 0/8 normoxic fetuses). Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with progressive metabolic acidosis (nadir: pH 7.08 ± 0.04 vs. 7.33 ± 0.02, p<0.01), hypotension during occlusions (nadir: 24.7 ± 1.8 vs. 51.4 ± 3.2 mmHg, p<0.01), lower carotid blood flow during occlusions (23.6 ± 6.1 vs. 63.0 ± 4.8 mL/min, p<0.01), greater suppression of EEG activity during, between, and after occlusions (p<0.01) and slower resolution of cortical impedance, an index of cytotoxic edema. No normoxic fetuses, but 4/8 hypoxic fetuses developed seizures 148 ± 45 minutes after the start of occlusions, with a seizure burden of 26 ± 6 sec during the inter-occlusion period, and 15.1 ± 3.4 min/h in the first 6 hours of recovery. In conclusion, in fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia, repeated brief asphyxia at a rate consistent with early labor is associated with hypotension, cephalic hypoperfusion, greater EEG suppression, inter-occlusion seizures, and more sustained cytotoxic edema, consistent with early onset of neural injury."
https://openalex.org/W2098838390,"Regulation of microglial migration is not well understood. In this study, we proposed that Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (NHE-1) is important in microglial migration. NHE-1 protein was co-localized with cytoskeletal protein ezrin in lamellipodia of microglia and maintained its more alkaline intracellular pH (pHi). Chemoattractant bradykinin (BK) stimulated microglial migration by increasing lamellipodial area and protrusion rate, but reducing lamellipodial persistence time. Interestingly, blocking NHE-1 activity with its potent inhibitor HOE 642 not only acidified microglia, abolished the BK-triggered dynamic changes of lamellipodia, but also reduced microglial motility and microchemotaxis in response to BK. In addition, NHE-1 activation resulted in intracellular Na(+) loading as well as intracellular Ca(2+) elevation mediated by stimulating reverse mode operation of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (NCXrev). Taken together, our study shows that NHE-1 protein is abundantly expressed in microglial lamellipodia and maintains alkaline pHi in response to BK stimulation. In addition, NHE-1 and NCXrev play a concerted role in BK-induced microglial migration via Na(+) and Ca(2+) signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2026366248,"Despite improvements in treatment strategies for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), outcomes have not significantly improved; highlighting the importance of identifying novel therapeutic approaches to target this disease. To address this challenge, we proceeded to evaluate the role of iron in HNSCC.Expression levels of iron-related genes were evaluated in HNSCC cell lines using quantitative RT-PCR. Cellular phenotypic effects were assessed using viability (MTS), clonogenic survival, BrdU, and tumor formation assays. The prognostic significance of iron-related proteins was determined using immunohistochemistry.In a panel of HNSCC cell lines, hemochromatosis (HFE) was one of the most overexpressed genes involved in iron regulation. In vitro knockdown of HFE in HNSCC cell lines significantly decreased hepcidin (HAMP) expression and intracellular iron level. This in turn, resulted in a significant decrease in HNSCC cell viability, clonogenicity, DNA synthesis, and Wnt signalling. These cellular changes were reversed by re-introducing iron back into HNSCC cells after HFE knockdown, indicating that iron was mediating this phenotype. Concordantly, treating HNSCC cells with an iron chelator, ciclopirox olamine (CPX), significantly reduced viability and clonogenic survival. Finally, patients with high HFE expression experienced a reduced survival compared to patients with low HFE expression.Our data identify HFE as potentially novel prognostic marker in HNSCC that promotes tumour progression via HAMP and elevated intracellular iron levels, leading to increased cellular proliferation and tumour formation. Hence, these findings suggest that iron chelators might have a therapeutic role in HNSCC management."
https://openalex.org/W2004004333,"We sought to understand patient perceptions of the emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) HIV diagnosis experience as well as factors that may promote or discourage linkage to HIV care. We conducted in-depth interviews with patients (n=24) whose HIV infection was diagnosed in the ED/UC of a public hospital in San Francisco at least six months prior and who linked to HIV care at the hospital HIV clinic. Key diagnosis experience themes included physical discomfort and limited functionality, presence of comorbid diagnoses, a wide spectrum of HIV risk perception, and feelings of isolation and anxiety. Patients diagnosed with HIV in the ED/UC may not have their desired emotional supports with them, either because they are alone or they are with family members or friends to whom they do not want to immediately disclose. Other patients may have no one they can rely on for immediate support. Nearly all participants described compassionate disclosure of test results by ED/UC providers, although several noted logistical issues that complicated the disclosure experience. Key linkage to care themes included the importance of continuity between the testing site and HIV care, hospital admission as an opportunity for support and HIV education, and thoughtful matching by linkage staff to a primary care provider. ED/UC clinicians and testing programs should be sensitive to the unique roles of sickness, risk perception, and isolation in the ED/UC diagnosis experience, as these things may delay acceptance of HIV diagnosis. The disclosure and linkage to care experience is crucial in forming patient attitudes towards HIV and HIV care, thus staff involved in disclosure and linkage activities should be trained to deliver compassionate, informed, and thoughtful care that bridges HIV testing and treatment sites."

P-gp activation/induction may function as an antidotal pathway to prevent the cytotoxicity of these substrates. In the present study we aimed at testing rifampicin (Rif) and three newly synthesized Rif derivatives (a mono-methoxylated derivative, MeORif, a peracetylated derivative, PerAcRif, and a reduced derivative, RedRif) to establish their ability to modulate P-gp expression and activity in a cellular model of the rat’s blood–brain barrier, the RBE4 cell line P-gp expression was assessed by western blot using C219 anti-P-gp antibody. P-gp function was evaluated by flow cytometry measuring the accumulation of rhodamine123. Whenever P-gp activation/induction ability was detected in a tested compound, its antidotal effect was further tested using paraquat as cytotoxicity model. Interactions between Rif or its derivatives and P-gp were also investigated by computational analysis. Rif led to a significant increase in P-gp expression at 72 h and RedRif significantly increased both P-gp expression and activity. No significant differences were observed for the other derivatives. Pre- or simultaneous treatment with RedRif protected cells against paraquat-induced cytotoxicity, an effect reverted by GF120918, a P-gp inhibitor, corroborating the observed P-gp activation ability. Interaction of RedRif with P-gp drug-binding pocket was consistent with an activation mechanism of action, which was confirmed with docking studies. Therefore, RedRif protection against paraquat-induced cytotoxicity in RBE4 cells, through P-gp activation/induction, suggests that it may be useful as an antidote for cytotoxic substrates of P-gp."
https://openalex.org/W2117030420,"Interactions between the cell basal membrane domain and the basement membrane are involved in several cell functions including proliferation, migration and differentiation. Intestinal epithelial cells can interact with laminin, a major intestinal basement membrane glycoprotein, via several cell-surface laminin-binding proteins including integrin and non-integrin receptors. The 37/67kDa laminin receptor (37/67LR) is one of these but its role in normal epithelial cells is still unknown. The aim of this study was to characterise the expression pattern and determine the main function of 37/67LR in the normal human small intestinal epithelium. Immunolocalization studies revealed that 37/67LR was predominantly present in the undifferentiated/proliferative region of the human intestinal crypt in both the immature and adult intestine. Using a human intestinal epithelial crypt (HIEC) cell line as experimental model, we determined that 37/67LR was expressed in proliferative cells in both the cytoplasmic and membrane compartments. Small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of 37/67LR expression led to HIEC cell-cycle reduction and loss of the ability to adhere to laminin-related peptides under conditions not altering ribosomal function. Taken together, these findings indicate that 37/67LR regulates proliferation and adhesion in normal intestinal epithelial cells independently of its known association with ribosomal function."
https://openalex.org/W1969618525,"Background Hydrocellular foam dressing, modern wound dressing, induces moist wound environment and promotes wound healing: however, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for these effects are poorly understood. This study was aimed to reveal the effect of hydrocellular foam dressing on hyaluronan, which has been shown to have positive effects on wound healing, and examined its regulatory mechanisms in rat skin. Methodology/Principal Findings We created two full-thickness wounds on the dorsolateral skin of rats. Each wound was covered with either a hydrocellular foam dressing or a film dressing and hyaluronan levels in the periwound skin was measured. We also investigated the mechanism by which the hydrocellular foam dressing regulates hyaluronan production by measuring the gene expression of hyaluronan synthase 3 (Has3), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and CD44. Hydrocellular foam dressing promoted wound healing and upregulated hyaluronan synthesis, along with an increase in the mRNA levels of Has3, which plays a primary role in hyaluronan synthesis in epidermis. In addition, hydrocellular foam dressing enhanced the mRNA levels of PPARα, which upregulates Has3 gene expression, and the major hyaluronan receptor CD44. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggests that hydrocellular foam dressing may be beneficial for wound healing along with increases in hyaluronan synthase 3 and PPARα gene expression in epidermis. We believe that the present study would contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the effects of hydrocellular foam dressing-induced moist environment on wound healing and practice evidence-based wound care."
https://openalex.org/W1982646913,"Cross-talk between the estrogen and the EGFR/HER signalling pathways has been suggested as a potential cause of resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer. Here, we determined HER1-4 receptor and neuregulin-1 (NRG1) ligand mRNA expression levels in breast cancers and corresponding normal breast tissue from patients previously characterized for plasma and tissue estrogen levels. In tumours from postmenopausal women harbouring normal HER2 gene copy numbers, we found HER2 and HER4, but HER3 levels in particular, to be elevated (2.48, 1.30 and 22.27 -fold respectively; P<0.01 for each) compared to normal tissue. Interestingly, HER3 as well as HER4 were higher among ER+ as compared to ER- tumours (P=0.004 and P=0.024, respectively). HER2 and HER3 expression levels correlated positively with ER mRNA (ESR1) expression levels (r=0.525, P=0.044; r=0.707, P=0.003, respectively). In contrast, EGFR/HER1 was downregulated in tumour compared to normal tissue (0.13-fold, P<0.001). In addition, EGFR/HER1 correlated negatively to intra-tumour (r=-0.633, P=0.001) as well as normal tissue (r=-0.556, P=0.006) and plasma estradiol levels (r=-0.625, P=0.002), suggesting an inverse regulation between estradiol and EGFR/HER1 levels. In ER+ tumours from postmenopausal women, NRG1 levels correlated positively with EGFR/HER1 (r=0.606, P=0.002) and negatively to ESR1 (r=-0.769, P=0.003) and E2 levels (r=-0.542, P=0.020). Our results indicate influence of estradiol on the expression of multiple components of the HER system in tumours not amplified for HER2, adding further support to the hypothesis that cross-talk between these systems may be of importance to breast cancer growth in vivo."

There is a growing concern regarding rejection and alteration of genetic code using this xenotransplantation approach. In this study, a novel strain of murine MSCs derived from the umbilical cord of wild-type and green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice have been successfully isolated, expanded, and characterized. After 10 passages, the mUC-MSCs developed a rather homogeneous, triangular, spindle-shaped morphology, and were sub-cultured up to 7 months (over 50 passages) without overt changes in morphology and doubling time. Cell surface markers are quite similar to MSCs isolated from other tissue origins as well as hUC-MSCs. These mUC-MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, neurons, and astrocytes in vitro, as well as hematopoietic lineage cells in vivo. mUC-MSCs also possess therapeutic potential against two disease models, focal ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and acute hepatic failure. Subtle differences in the expression of cytokine-related genes exist between mUC-MSCs and hUC-MSCs, which may retard and jeopardize the advance of cell therapy. Allografts of these newly established mUC-MSCs into various mouse disease models may deepen our insights into the development of more effective cell therapy regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2008397827,"Rem2 is a member of the RGK family of small Ras-like GTPases whose expression and function is regulated by neuronal activity in the brain. A number of questions still remain as to the endogenous functions of Rem2 in neurons. RNAi-mediated Rem2 knockdown leads to an increase in dendritic complexity and a decrease in functional excitatory synapses, though a recent report challenged the specificity of Rem2-targeted RNAi reagents. In addition, overexpression in a number of cell types has shown that Rem2 can inhibit voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) function, while studies employing RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rem2 have failed to observe a corresponding enhancement of VGCC function. To further investigate these discrepancies and determine the endogenous function of Rem2, we took a comprehensive, loss-of-function approach utilizing two independent, validated Rem2-targeted shRNAs to analyze Rem2 function. We sought to investigate the consequence of endogenous Rem2 knockdown by focusing on the three reported functions of Rem2 in neurons: regulation of synapse formation, dendritic morphology, and voltage-gated calcium channels. We conclude that endogenous Rem2 is a positive regulator of functional, excitatory synapse development and a negative regulator of dendritic complexity. In addition, while we are unable to reach a definitive conclusion as to whether the regulation of VGCCs is an endogenous function of Rem2, our study reports important data regarding RNAi reagents for use in future investigation of this issue."

The current study investigated the role of cultural background on the development of face scanning in young children between the ages of 1 and 7 years, and its modulation by the eye gaze direction of the face. British and Japanese participants’ eye movements were recorded while they observed faces moving their eyes towards or away from the participants. British children fixated more on the mouth whereas Japanese children fixated more on the eyes, replicating the results with adult participants. No cultural differences were observed in the differential responses to direct and averted gaze. The results suggest that different patterns of face scanning exist between different cultures from the first years of life, but differential scanning of direct and averted gaze associated with different cultural norms develop later in life."

Methods A face-to-face interview sought information about: socio-demographics, frequency of discrimination, verbal harassment, and physical and sexual violence because of their sexual orientation, and their fear of suffering each types of victimization. Results In the whole sample, 28.3% and 11.9% self-reported at least one episode of victimization because of the sexual orientation in their lifetime and in the last year. Those unmarried, compared to the others, and with a college degree or higher, compared to less educated respondents, were more likely to have experienced an episode of victimization in their lifetime. Lesbians, compared to bisexual, had almost twice the odds of experiencing an episode of victimization. The most commonly reported experiences across the lifetime were verbal harassment, discrimination, and physical or sexual violence. Among those who had experienced one episode of victimization in their lifetime, 42.1% self-reported one episode in the last year. Perceived fear of suffering violence because of their sexual orientation, measured on a 10-point Likert scale with a higher score indicative of greater fear, ranges from 5.7 for verbal harassment to 6.4 for discrimination. Participants were more likely to have fear of suffering victimization because of their sexual orientation if they were female (compared to male), lesbian and gay men (compared to bisexual women and men), unmarried (compared to the others), and if they have already suffered an episode of victimization (compared to those who have not suffered an episode). Conclusions The study provides important insights into the violence experiences of lesbian, gay men, and bisexual women and men and the results may serve for improving policy initiatives to reduce such episodes."

https://openalex.org/W2131464527,"Human interleukin-3 (hIL-3) is a polypeptide growth factor that regulates the proliferation, differentiation, survival and function of hematopoietic progenitors and many mature blood cell lineages. Although recombinant hIL-3 is a widely used laboratory reagent in hematology, standard methods for its preparation, including those employed by commercial suppliers, remain arduous owing to a reliance on refolding insoluble protein expressed in E. coli. In addition, wild-type hIL-3 is a poor substrate for radio-iodination, which has been a long-standing hindrance to its use in receptor binding assays. To overcome these problems, we developed a method for expression of hIL-3 in E. coli as a soluble protein, with typical yields of >3mg of purified hIL-3 per litre of shaking microbial culture. Additionally, we introduced a non-native tyrosine residue into our hIL-3 analog, which allowed radio-iodination to high specific activities for receptor binding studies whilst not compromising bioactivity. The method presented herein provides a cost-effective and convenient route to milligram quantities of a hIL-3 analog with wild-type bioactivity that, unlike wild-type hIL‑3, can be efficiently radio-iodinated for receptor binding studies."

To examine whether the phenotype in the pancreas and stomach is due to autoimmune reaction associated with autoantibody production, indirect immunofluorescence staining followed by Western blot analysis was performed. Consequently, the autoantibody against pancreas and stomach was detected in the sera of Aire KO mice, and the target antigen of the autoantibody was identified as protein disulfide isomerase-associated 2 (Pdia2), which was reported to be expressed preferentially in the pancreas and stomach. Thus, Aire KO mice of BALB/cAnN background can serve as a useful animal model for autoimmune gastro-pancreatitis with anti-Pdia2 autoantibody production."
https://openalex.org/W2073901509,"Objectives New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly occurs in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Data regarding the value of the CHADS2 score in patients hospitalized for AMI is limited. This study aimed to determine whether the CHADS2 score is associated with new-onset AF and if it can help identify the patients who will benefit most from statin use for the prevention of arrhythmia after AMI. Methods A total of 724 consecutive AMI patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to their CHADS2 scores: group 1, score 0; group 2, score 1–2; and group 3, score 3–6. The study endpoint was an episode of new-onset AF that lasted more than 30 seconds during hospitalization at the coronary care unit. Results Seventy-eight (10.8%) patients developed new-onset AF, and 273 (37.7%) were on a statin upon admission. The incidence of new-onset AF increased significantly from 5.8% in group 1 to 11.3% in group 2 and 14.3% in group 3 (χ2 for linear trend, P = 0.017). Statin use (odds ratio [OR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06–0.85) and CHADS2 score (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.02–2.28) were independent predictors of new-onset AF in AMI patients. Patients with CHADS2 score ≤2 had significantly reduced C-reactive protein level and lower risk of developing new-onset AF if they were taking statins (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated the benefit of statin use for preventing new-onset AF in patients with CHADS2 scores ≤2 (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14–0.81). Conclusions The CHADS2 score is a convenient scoring system for predicting the incidence of new-onset AF and may help in identifying the patients who will benefit most from statin use for the prevention of arrhythmia after AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2020193343,"The Drosophila compound eye is a large sensory organ that places a high demand on oxygen supplied by the tracheal system. Although the development and function of the Drosophila visual system has been extensively studied, the development and contribution of its tracheal system has not been systematically examined. To address this issue, we studied the tracheal patterns and developmental process in the Drosophila visual system. We found that the retinal tracheae are derived from air sacs in the head, and the ingrowth of retinal trachea begin at mid-pupal stage. The tracheal development has three stages. First, the air sacs form near the optic lobe in 42-47% of pupal development (pd). Second, in 47-52% pd, air sacs extend branches along the base of the retina following a posterior-to-anterior direction and further form the tracheal network under the fenestrated membrane (TNUFM). Third, the TNUFM extend fine branches into the retina following a proximal-to-distal direction after 60% pd. Furthermore, we found that the trachea extension in both retina and TNUFM are dependent on the FGF(Bnl)/FGFR(Btl) signaling. Our results also provided strong evidence that the photoreceptors are the source of the Bnl ligand to guide the trachea ingrowth. Our work is the first systematic study of the tracheal development in the visual system, and also the first study demonstrating the interactions of two well-studied systems: the eye and trachea."
