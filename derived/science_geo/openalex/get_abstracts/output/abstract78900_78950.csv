https://openalex.org/W2016066788,"THERE are now methods of separating in bulk neuronal and neuroglial cells1,2, and we have used them to study the in vivo synthesis of RNA in these cellular fractions. There seem to be significant differences between the kinetics of labelling of the RNA of the two cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2023227427,"CAMPBELL'S expressed aim1 is “to describe the entropy pump whereby the species of living matter not only prevent a drop into a position of greater positive entropy at each generation, but may in fact acquire more negentropy as their reproduction continues”. This is attempted by recourse to the example of a codfish laying a million eggs the entropy content of whose genomes shows a normal distribution about a mean value in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. On one tail of this distribution curve will be a small percentage of eggs with an entropy content equal to or less than that of the parents. There follows the crucial sentence: “These remarkable ones are most likely to grow up and repeat the reproductive process”. What follows in Campbell's communication is unexceptionable provided that this sentence is true. But what is the evidence that those eggs which are “most likely to grow and repeat the reproductive process” are those whose genomes have a lower entropy content than those of the parents ? It is at this point that the author merely evades one of the most important questions at issue in the earlier correspondence2–4. The genome may be regarded as a series of DNA molecules functioning as templates. The thermodynamic entropy content of these molecules is a function of the arrangement of the atoms, conventionally expressed as k. log D where k is the Boltzmann constant and D is a measure of the atomic disorder. A single alteration in the relative positions of adjacent nucleotide bases could convert a crucial part of the genome code to nonsense so that its capacity to support development was lost, but this could occur without an increase, indeed even with a decrease, in the thermodynamic entropy content of the genome molecules5. Stated in a more general way, this is the problem of the relationship between the amount of developmentally meaningful organization in the genome (we will call this the information content) and its entropy content. There are two problems here: first, the definition and quantization of the information content of the genome and, second, the nature of its relationship to the thermodynamic entropy content. One avenue of enquiry which offers hope in this situation would seem to be the information theory analogy."

https://openalex.org/W2056216802,"THERE is considerable evidence for the involvement of dopamine in the extrapyramidal system and in its disorders1–4. The methoxy derivative of dopamine, 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine (DMPEA), as measured by the paper chromatographic method of Friedhoff and Van Winkle5, was excreted in a large concentration in the urine of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease6. On the other hand, DMPEA caused a hypokinetic and rigid syndrome in experimental animals7,8, thus further increasing the significance of this compound in extrapyramidal disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2084211100,GENETIC data concerning the important plant pathogen Phytophthora have been lacking because of the difficulty in germinating oospores of this fungal genus. The discovery of mating types in Phytophthora infestans1 and in other species of the genus has permitted the examination of segregation of various factors if the sexual spores can be germinated. This report concerns inheritance and the condition of the nucleus in Phytophthora drechsleri.

https://openalex.org/W2072123454,"WE have described the in vitro alteration of the blood group I receptor of the red cell by mycoplasma, and stated that the effect was greater on group A cells than on group O cells1. We also noted that Clostridium filtrates which had been reported by other workers to destroy the specific I determinant were more active against group A than against group O cells2. For these reasons we used group A1I red cells in our final test system which employed the gamma macroglobulin fraction from a group A2 patient who was I negative as our agglutinating reagent. Feizi and Darrell have now reported their failure to find an effect of mycoplasma on the receptors for I. Unfortunately, they used group OI cells instead of group AI cells in their test system3."
