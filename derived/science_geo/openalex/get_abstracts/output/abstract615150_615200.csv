https://openalex.org/W2884793593,"The maximum power output and minimum charging time of a lithium-ion battery depend on both ionic and electronic transport. Ionic diffusion within the electrochemically active particles generally represents a fundamental limitation to the rate at which a battery can be charged and discharged. To compensate for the relatively slow solid-state ionic diffusion and to enable high power and rapid charging, the active particles are frequently reduced to nanometre dimensions, to the detriment of volumetric packing density, cost, stability and sustainability. As an alternative to nanoscaling, here we show that two complex niobium tungsten oxides-Nb16W5O55 and Nb18W16O93, which adopt crystallographic shear and bronze-like structures, respectively-can intercalate large quantities of lithium at high rates, even when the sizes of the niobium tungsten oxide particles are of the order of micrometres. Measurements of lithium-ion diffusion coefficients in both structures reveal room-temperature values that are several orders of magnitude higher than those in typical electrode materials such as Li4Ti5O12 and LiMn2O4. Multielectron redox, buffered volume expansion, topologically frustrated niobium/tungsten polyhedral arrangements and rapid solid-state lithium transport lead to extremely high volumetric capacities and rate performance. Unconventional materials and mechanisms that enable lithiation of micrometre-sized particles in minutes have implications for high-power applications, fast-charging devices, all-solid-state energy storage systems, electrode design and material discovery."

https://openalex.org/W2884346629,"Devices that rely on the manipulation of excitons—bound pairs of electrons and holes—hold great promise for realizing efficient interconnects between optical data transmission and electrical processing systems. Although exciton-based transistor actions have been demonstrated successfully in bulk semiconductor-based coupled quantum wells1–3, the low temperature required for their operation limits their practical application. The recent emergence of two-dimensional semiconductors with large exciton binding energies4,5 may lead to excitonic devices and circuits that operate at room temperature. Whereas individual two-dimensional materials have short exciton diffusion lengths, the spatial separation of electrons and holes in different layers in heterostructures could help to overcome this limitation and enable room-temperature operation of mesoscale devices6–8. Here we report excitonic devices made of MoS2–WSe2 van der Waals heterostructures encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride that demonstrate electrically controlled transistor actions at room temperature. The long-lived nature of the interlayer excitons in our device results in them diffusing over a distance of five micrometres. Within our device, we further demonstrate the ability to manipulate exciton dynamics by creating electrically reconfigurable confining and repulsive potentials for the exciton flux. Our results make a strong case for integrating two-dimensional materials in future excitonic devices to enable operation at room temperature. Heterobilayer excitonic devices consisting of two different van der Waals materials, in which excitons are shared between the layers, exhibit electrically controlled switching actions at room temperature."

Whether any liquid water remains on Mars today has long been debated. Orosei et al. used radar measurements from the Mars Express spacecraft to search for liquid water in Mars' southern ice cap (see the Perspective by Diez). They detected a 20-km-wide lake of liquid water underneath solid ice in the Planum Australe region. The water is probably kept from freezing by dissolved salts and the pressure of the ice above. The presence of liquid water on Mars has implications for astrobiology and future human exploration. Science , this issue p. 490 ; see also p. 448"

https://openalex.org/W2883382927,"Global warming is markedly changing diverse coral reef ecosystems through an increasing frequency and magnitude of mass bleaching events1–3. How local impacts scale up across affected regions depends on numerous factors, including patchiness in coral mortality, metabolic effects of extreme temperatures on populations of reef-dwelling species4 and interactions between taxa. Here we use data from before and after the 2016 mass bleaching event to evaluate ecological changes in corals, algae, fishes and mobile invertebrates at 186 sites along the full latitudinal span of the Great Barrier Reef and western Coral Sea. One year after the bleaching event, reductions in live coral cover of up to 51% were observed on surveyed reefs that experienced extreme temperatures; however, regional patterns of coral mortality were patchy. Consistent declines in coral-feeding fishes were evident at the most heavily affected reefs, whereas few other short-term responses of reef fishes and invertebrates could be attributed directly to changes in coral cover. Nevertheless, substantial region-wide ecological changes occurred that were mostly independent of coral loss, and instead appeared to be linked directly to sea temperatures. Community-wide trophic restructuring was evident, with weakening of strong pre-existing latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fishes, invertebrates and their functional groups. In particular, fishes that scrape algae from reef surfaces, which are considered to be important for recovery after bleaching2, declined on northern reefs, whereas other herbivorous groups increased on southern reefs. The full impact of the 2016 bleaching event may not be realized until dead corals erode during the next decade5,6. However, our short-term observations suggest that the recovery processes, and the ultimate scale of impact, are affected by functional changes in communities, which in turn depend on the thermal affinities of local reef-associated fauna. Such changes will vary geographically, and may be particularly acute at locations where many fishes and invertebrates are close to their thermal distribution limits7. Fish and invertebrate communities transformed across the span of the Great Barrier Reef following the 2016 bleaching event due to a decline in coral-feeding fishes resulting from coral loss, and because of different regional responses of key trophic groups to the direct effect of temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2617129083,"Injuries have a great impact on professional soccer, due to their large influence on team performance and the considerable costs of rehabilitation for players. Existing studies in the literature provide just a preliminary understanding of which factors mostly affect injury risk, while an evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional approach to injury forecasting in professional soccer that is based on GPS measurements and machine learning. By using GPS tracking technology, we collect data describing the training workload of players in a professional soccer club during a season. We then construct an injury forecaster and show that it is both accurate and interpretable by providing a set of case studies of interest to soccer practitioners. Our approach opens a novel perspective on injury prevention, providing a set of simple and practical rules for evaluating and interpreting the complex relations between injury risk and training performance in professional soccer."

https://openalex.org/W2883080322,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent an important clinical problem associated with increased levels of surgical morbidity and mortality. UVC irradiation during surgery has been considered to represent a possible strategy to prevent the development of SSI. 254-nm UVC induces marked levels of DNA damage by generating cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in microorganisms. However, this effect is elicited not only in microorganisms, but also in human cells, and chronic exposure to 254-nm UVC has been established to represent a human health hazard. In contrast, despite short wavelength-UVC light, especially 222-nm UVC, having been demonstrated to elicit a bactericidal effect, single irradiation with a high dose of 222-nm UVC energy has been reported to not induce mutagenic or cytotoxic DNA lesions in mammalian cells. However, the effect of chronic irradiation with a high dose of 222-nm UVC to mammalian cells has not been determined. In this study, it was demonstrated that large numbers of CPD-expressing cells were induced in the epidermis of mice following treatment with a small amount of single exposure 254-nm UVC, and then less than half of these cells reduced within 24 h. Chronic 254-nm UVC irradiation was revealed to induce sunburn and desquamation in mouse skin. Histological analysis demonstrated that small numbers of CPD-expressing cells were detected only in hyperkeratotic stratum corneum after chronic irradiation with a high dose of 254-nm UVC, and that significant hyperplasia and intercellular edema were also induced in the epidermis of mice. In contrast, chronic irradiation with 222-nm UVC light was revealed not to induce mutagenic or cytotoxic effects in the epidermis of mice. These results indicated that 222-nm UVC light emitted from the lamp apparatus (or device), which was designed to attenuate harmful light present in wavelengths of more than 230 nm, represents a promising tool for the reduction of SSI incidence in patients and hospital staff."

https://openalex.org/W3102874438,"The decay of an excited atom undergoing spontaneous photon emission into the fluctuating quantum-electrodynamic vacuum is an emblematic example of the dynamics of an open quantum system. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the gapped photon dispersion in periodic structures, which prevents photons in certain frequency ranges from propagating, can give rise to unusual spontaneous-decay behaviour, including the formation of dissipative bound states1–3. So far, these effects have been restricted to the optical domain. Here we demonstrate similar behaviour in a system of artificial emitters, realized using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, which decay by emitting matter-wave, rather than optical, radiation into free space. By controlling vacuum coupling and the excitation energy, we directly observe exponential and partly reversible non-Markovian dynamics and detect a tunable bound state that contains evanescent matter waves. Our system provides a flexible platform for simulating open-system quantum electrodynamics and for studying dissipative many-body physics with ultracold atoms4–6. An open quantum system containing ultracold rubidium atoms trapped in an optical lattice undergoes spontaneous emission of matter waves into free space."
https://openalex.org/W2884481634,"To encode specific sensory inputs, cortical neurons must generate selective responses for distinct stimulus features. In principle, a variety of factors can contribute to the response selectivity of a cortical neuron: the tuning and strength of excitatory1-3 and inhibitory synaptic inputs4-6, dendritic nonlinearities7-9 and spike threshold10,11. Here we use a combination of techniques including in vivo whole-cell recording, synaptic- and cellular-resolution in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) neuron-selective optogenetic manipulation to dissect the factors that contribute to the direction-selective responses of layer 2/3 neurons in ferret visual cortex (V1). Two-photon calcium imaging of dendritic spines12,13 revealed that each neuron receives a mixture of excitatory synaptic inputs selective for the somatic preferred or null direction of motion. The relative number of preferred- and null-tuned excitatory inputs predicted a neuron's somatic direction preference, but failed to account for the degree of direction selectivity. By contrast, in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed a notable degree of direction selectivity in subthreshold responses that was significantly correlated with spiking direction selectivity. Subthreshold direction selectivity was predicted by the magnitude and variance of the response to the null direction of motion, and several lines of evidence, including conductance measurements, demonstrate that differential tuning of excitation and inhibition suppresses responses to the null direction of motion. Consistent with this idea, optogenetic inactivation of GABAergic neurons in layer 2/3 reduced direction selectivity by enhancing responses to the null direction. Furthermore, by optogenetically mapping connections of inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 in vivo, we find that layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons make long-range, intercolumnar projections to excitatory neurons that prefer the opposite direction of motion. We conclude that intracortical inhibition exerts a major influence on the degree of direction selectivity in layer 2/3 of ferret V1 by suppressing responses to the null direction of motion."

Ethiopia has one of the highest teenage fertility rates in Sub-Saharan Africa; however determinants of teenage pregnancy are not well studied. Therefore, this study aimed to identify determinants of teenage pregnancy among female teenagers in Degua Tembien district, Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, in 2015.A community-based case-control study was conducted in Degua' Tembien district from February 01, 2015 to March 15, 2015 with a randomly selected total sample size of 414 females (with a ratio of 1:2 case to control, 138 and 276 respectively). Data were entered in to Epi-Info and analyzed using SPSS software. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess predictors of the outcome variable; variables with a p-value <0.25 in bivariable analysis were included in the model. Statistically significance was considered at a p-value ≤0.05 in both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.The mean ages (plus or minus standard deviation (±SD)) of cases and controls were 18.47 (0.72) and 17.09 (1.2) years, respectively. After adjustment for other variables, predictors of teenage pregnancy included: lower monthly income below ~$25 and ~$25-50 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 23.96; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 4.89-117.29 and AOR = 4.91; 95%CI 1.64-14.66, respectively); aged 18-19 years (AOR = 16.75; 95%CI 6.45-43.47); being married (AOR = 15.91; 95%CI 7.43-34.04); not communicating with parents on reproductive health issues (AOR = 6.52; 95%CI 3.12-13.64) and having a history of maternal teenage pregnancy (AOR = 4.14; 95%CI 1.84-9.33).The factors associated with teenage pregnancy in our study were lower family monthly income, being married, being in the 18-19 year age group, not communicating with parents on reproductive health issues and having a maternal history of teenage pregnancy. Programs that encourage parent-teenage communication of reproductive health issues, starting from early adolescence, in order to build skills to prevent pregnancy in the late teenage years, are very important. In addition, multi-pronged activities across sectors that encourage delayed marriage and improve health service utilizations for girls are essential."
https://openalex.org/W2883994680,"In this paper we demonstrate a potentiostat built with a single commercially available integrated circuit (IC) that does not require any external electronic components to perform electrochemical experiments. This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC®) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components. To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead."
https://openalex.org/W2884902244,"The chemical compositions of stars encode those of the gas from which they formed, providing important clues regarding the formation histories of galaxies. A powerful diagnostic is the abundance of α elements (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Ti) relative to iron, [α/Fe]. The α elements are synthesized and injected into the interstellar medium by type II supernovae, which occur about ten million years after their originating stars form; by contrast, iron is returned to the interstellar medium by type Ia supernovae, which occur after a much longer timescale of roughly one billion years1. Periods of rapid star formation therefore tend to produce high-[α/Fe] stellar populations (because only type II supernovae have time to contribute to interstellar-medium enrichment as the stellar population forms), whereas low-[α/Fe] stars require periods of star formation that last more than a few billion years (over which timescales type Ia supernovae begin to affect the elemental composition of the interstellar medium more strongly than type II supernovae). The existence of two distinct groups of stars in the solar neighbourhood2–7, one with high [α/Fe] and the other with low [α/Fe], therefore suggests two different origins, but the mechanism by which this bimodal distribution arose remains unknown. Here we use a model of disk-galaxy evolution to show that the two episodes of star formation8 predicted by the ‘cold flow’ theory of galactic gas accretion9,10 also explain the observed chemical bimodality. In this scenario, the high-[α/Fe] stars form early, during an initial phase of accretion that involves infalling streams of cold primordial gas. There is then a hiatus of around two billion years until the shock-heated gas in the galactic dark-matter halo has cooled as a result of radiation and can itself commence accretion. The low-[α/Fe] stars form during this second phase. The peaks in these two star-formation episodes are separated by around five billion years. In addition, the large-scale variation in the abundance patterns of these two stellar populations that has been observed for the Milky Way5,7 is partially explained by the spatial variation in this gas-accretion history. The two episodes of star formation predicted by the ‘cold flow’ theory of galactic gas accretion also explain the observed bimodality in the chemical-abundance distribution of solar-neighbourhood stars."

We propose to use NASA GeneLab database to gain new knowledge on potential systemic responses to space. Unbiased systems biology analysis of transcriptomic data from seven different rodent datasets reveals for the first time the existence of potential “master regulators” coordinating a systemic response to microgravity and/or space radiation with TGF-β1 being the most common regulator. We hypothesized the space environment leads to the release of biomolecules circulating inside the blood stream. Through datamining we identified 13 candidate microRNAs (miRNA) which are common in all studies and directly interact with TGF-β1 that can be potential circulating factors impacting space biology. This study exemplifies the utility of the GeneLab data repository to aid in the process of performing novel hypothesis–based research.

https://openalex.org/W2883767776,"Background Mechanical loading stimulates Achilles tendon healing. However, various degrees of loading appear to have different effects on the mechanical properties of the healing tendon, and strong loading might create microdamage in the tissue. This suggests that different mechanisms might be activated depending on the magnitude of loading. The aim of this study was to investigate these mechanisms further. Methods Female rats had their right Achilles tendon cut transversely and divided into three groups: 1) unloading (calf muscle paralysis by Botox injections, combined with joint fixation by a steel-orthosis), 2) mild loading (Botox only), 3) strong loading (free cage activity). Gene expression was analyzed by PCR, 5 days post-injury, and mechanical testing 8 days post-injury. The occurrence of microdamage was analyzed 3, 5, or 14 days post-injury, by measuring leakage of injected fluorescence-labelled albumin in the healing tendon tissue. Results Peak force, peak stress, and elastic modulus of the healing tendons gradually improved with increased loading as well as the expression of extracellular matrix genes. In contrast, only strong loading increased transverse area and affected inflammation genes. Strong loading led to higher fluorescence (as a sign of microdamage) compared to mild loading at 3 and 5 days post-injury, but not at 14 days. Discussion Our results show that strong loading improves both the quality and quantity of the healing tendon, while mild loading only improves the quality. Strong loading also induces microdamage and alters the inflammatory response. This suggests that mild loading exert its effect via mechanotransduction mechanisms, while strong loading exert its effect both via mechanotransduction and the creation of microdamage. Conclusion In conclusion, mild loading is enough to increase the quality of the healing tendon without inducing microdamage and alter the inflammation in the tissue. This supports the general conception that early mobilization of a ruptured tendon in patients is advantageous."

Species identification is essential for TCM quality control because authentic herbs are possibly substituted with adulterants that would threaten the health of the public or even cause death. Here, we provided the first local reference DNA barcode library based on the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) for the molecular identification of SCM. A total of 1512 specimens of southern herbs representing 359 species were collected under the instructions and identification of taxonomic experts. Genomic DNA was extracted, and the PCR reaction proceeded according to standard procedures. After Sanger sequencing, sequence assembling and annotation, a reliable ITS2 barcode library with 1276 sequences from 309 species of Southern herbs was constructed. The PCR efficiency of the whole samples was 84.39%. Characteristics of the ITS2 barcode were analyzed, including sequence lengths and GC contents in different taxa. Neighbor-joining trees based on Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) genetic distances showed a 67.56% successful rate of species identification with ITS2 barcode. In addition, 96.57% of species could be successfully identified at the genus level by the BLAST method. Eleven plant species were discovered to be cryptic. In addition, we found that there is an incorrect sequence existing in the public database, making a reliable local DNA barcode reference more meaningful. ITS2 barcodes exhibit advantages in TCM identification. This DNA barcode reference library could be used in Southern Chinese Medicine quality control, thus contributing to protecting public health."
https://openalex.org/W2884618098,"Experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and mindfulness have all been associated with psychological disorders and well-being. This study investigates whether they predict psychological distress, i.e., symptoms of burnout, depression, stress and anxiety, in parents of children with chronic conditions. We hypothesized that these factors would exhibit a large degree of common variance, and that when compared to mindfulness and defusion, experiential avoidance on its own would predict a larger proportion of unique variance. 75 parents of children with chronic conditions having burnout symptoms who participated in an intervention study completed measures of burnout, stress, anxiety, depression, experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and mindfulness at the beginning of the intervention study (baseline). We ran several regression analyses to assess the predictive ability of these different constructs. Experiential avoidance on its own accounted for 28–48% of the variance in different psychological symptoms. Cognitive defusion and mindfulness did not make a significant contribution to explaining burnout, stress and anxiety, but cognitive defusion contributed to explaining depression. The results confirmed our hypothesis, supporting research on the importance of psychological flexibility as a central factor in understanding the occurrence of psychological distress."

We sought to determine whether patients hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation were at greater risk of readmission if they had a high blood eosinophil count documented before the first hospitalization.This historical cohort study drew on 2 years of medical record data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink with Hospital Episode Statistics linkage) of patients (aged ≥5 years) admitted to hospital in England for asthma, with recorded blood eosinophil count within 1 baseline year before admission. We analyzed the association between high blood eosinophil count (≥0.35x109 cells/L) and readmission risk during 1 year of follow-up after hospital discharge, with adjustment for predefined, relevant confounders using forward selection.We identified 2,613 eligible patients with asthma-related admission, of median age 51 years (interquartile range, 36-69) and 76% women (1,997/2,613). Overall, 835/2,613 (32.0%) had a preadmission high blood eosinophil count. During the follow-up year, 130/2,613 patients (5.0%) were readmitted for asthma, including 55/835 (6.6%) with vs. 75/1,778 (4.2%) without high blood eosinophil count at baseline (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.49; 95% CI 1.04-2.13, p = 0.029). The association was strongest in never-smokers (n = 1,296; HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.27-3.68, p = 0.005) and absent in current smokers (n = 547; HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49-2.04, p = 0.997).A high blood eosinophil count in the year before an asthma-related hospitalization is associated with increased risk of readmission within the following year. These findings suggest that patients with asthma and preadmission high blood eosinophil count require careful follow-up, with treatment optimization, after discharge."
https://openalex.org/W2884254861,"Introduction Antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of serious illness among people living with HIV and can prevent HIV transmission. We implemented a Test, Treat, and Prevent HIV Program among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women at five hospitals in four provinces of Thailand to increase HIV testing, help those who test positive start antiretroviral therapy, and increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Methods We implemented rapid HIV testing and trained staff on immediate antiretroviral initiation at the five hospitals and offered PrEP at two hospitals. We recruited MSM and transgender women who walked-in to clinics and used a peer-driven intervention to expand recruitment. We used logistic regression to determine factors associated with prevalent HIV infection and the decision to start antiretroviral therapy and PrEP. Results During 2015 and 2016, 1880 people enrolled. Participants recruited by peers were younger (p<0.0001), less likely to be HIV-infected (p<0.0001), and those infected had higher CD4 counts (p = 0.04) than participants who walked-in to the clinics. Overall, 16% were HIV-positive: 18% of MSM and 9% of transgender women; 86% started antiretroviral therapy and 46% of eligible participants started PrEP. A higher proportion of participants at hospitals with one-stop HIV services started antiretroviral therapy than other hospitals. Participants who started PrEP were more likely to report sex with an HIV-infected partner (p = 0.002), receptive anal intercourse (p = 0.02), and receiving PrEP information from a hospital (p<0.0001). Conclusions We implemented a Test, Treat, and Prevent HIV Program offering rapid HIV testing and immediate access to antiretroviral therapy and PrEP. Peer-driven recruitment reached people at high risk of HIV and people early in HIV illness, providing an opportunity to promote HIV prevention services including PrEP and early antiretroviral therapy. Sites with one-stop HIV services had a higher uptake of antiretroviral therapy and PrEP."
https://openalex.org/W2884527766,"The role of IL-27 in antiviral immunity is still incompletely understood, especially in the context of chronic viruses that induce a unique environment in their infected host. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) establishes a persistent, tissue localized infection followed by lifelong latency. CMV infects the majority of people and although asymptomatic in healthy individuals, can cause serious disease or death in those with naïve or compromised immune systems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a protective CMV vaccine for people at-risk and identifying key regulators of the protective immune response towards CMV will be crucial. Here we studied mouse CMV (MCMV) in IL-27 receptor deficient animals (Il27ra-/-) to assess the role of IL-27 in regulating CMV immunity. We found that IL-27 enhanced the number of antiviral CD4 T cells upon infection. However, in contrast to a well-established role for CD4 T cells in controlling persistent replication and a positive effect of IL-27 on their numbers, IL-27 promoted MCMV persistence in the salivary gland. This coincided with IL-27 mediated induction of IL-10 production in CD4 T cells. Moreover, IL-27 reduced expression of the transcription factor T-bet and restricted a cytotoxic phenotype in antiviral CD4 T cells. This is a highly intriguing result given the profound cytotoxic phenotype of CMV-specific CD4 T cells seen in humans and we established that dendritic cell derived IL-27 was responsible for this effect. Together, these data show that IL-27 regulates the number and effector functions of MCMV-specific CD4 T cells and could be targeted to enhance control of persistent/latent infection."

https://openalex.org/W2884246233,"Mammographic screening has led to increased detection of breast cancer at a pre-invasive state, hence modelling the earliest stages of breast cancer invasion is important in defining candidate biomarkers to predict risk of relapse. Discrimination of pre-invasive from invasive lesions is critically important for such studies. Myoepithelial cells are the barrier between epithelial cells and the surrounding stroma in the breast ductal system. A number of myoepithelial immunohistochemistry markers have been identified and validated in human tissue for use by pathologists as diagnostic tools to distinguish in situ carcinoma from invasive breast cancer. However, robust myoepithelial markers for mouse mammary tissue have been largely under-utilised. Here, we investigated the utility of the myoepithelial markers smooth muscle actin (SMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), cytokeratin-14 (CK14) and p63 to discriminate mammary intraepithelial neoplasia (MIN) from invasive disease in the C57BL/6J MMTV-PyMT transgenic model of mammary carcinoma. We identified that SMMHC and CK14 are retained in early in situ neoplasia and are appropriate markers for distinguishing MIN from invasive disease in this model. Additionally, the proliferation marker Ki67 is a superior marker for differentiating between normal and hyperplastic ducts, prior to the development of MIN. Based on this, we developed a scoring matrix for discriminating normal, hyperplasia, MIN and invasive lesions in this spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis model. This study demonstrates heterogeneous expression of myoepithelial proteins throughout tumour development, and highlights the need to characterise the most appropriate markers in other models of early breast cancer to allow accurate classification of disease state."
https://openalex.org/W2884295001,"Macrophages express a wide array of invariant receptors that facilitate host defense and mediate pathogenesis during pathogen invasion. We report on a novel population of CD11bhighCD14+F4/80+ macrophages that express TCRβ. This population expands dramatically during a Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection and sequesters in the brain during experimental cerebral malaria. Importantly, measurement of TCRβ transcript and protein levels in macrophages in wildtype versus nude and Rag1 knockout mice establishes that the observed expression is not a consequence of passive receptor expression due to phagocytosis or trogocytosis of peripheral T cells or nonspecific antibody staining to an Fc receptor or cross reactive epitope. We also demonstrate that TCRβ on brain sequestered macrophages undergoes productive gene rearrangements and shows preferential Vβ usage. Remarkably, there is a significant correlation in the proportion of macrophages that express TCRβ and peripheral parasitemia. In addition, presence of TCRβ on the macrophage also correlates with a significant increase (1.9 fold) in the phagocytosis of parasitized erythrocytes. By transcriptional profiling, we identify a novel set of genes and pathways that associate with TCRβ expression by the macrophage. Expansion of TCRβ-expressing macrophages points towards a convergence of the innate and adaptive immune responses where both arms of the immune system cooperate to modulate the host response to malaria and possibly other infections."

Objective To estimate clinical and economic benefits of introducing PCV13 into a NIP in China using local cost estimates and accounting for variability in vaccine uptake and indirect (herd protection) effects. Methods We developed a population model to estimate the effect of PCV13 introduction in China. Modeled health states included meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia (PNE), acute otitis media, death and sequelae, and no disease. Direct healthcare costs and disease incidence data for IPD and PNE were derived from the China Health Insurance and Research Association database; all other parameters were derived from published literature. We estimated total disease cases and associated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and deaths for three scenarios from a Chinese Payer Perspective: (1) direct effects only, (2) direct+indirect effects for IPD only, and (3) direct+indirect effects for IPD and inpatient PNE. Results Scenario (1) resulted in 370.3 thousand QALYs gained and 12.8 thousand deaths avoided versus no vaccination. In scenarios (2) and (3), the PCV13 NIP gained 383.2 thousand and 3,580 thousand QALYs, and avoided 13.1 thousand and 147.5 thousand deaths versus no vaccination, respectively. In all three scenarios, the vaccination cost was offset by cost reductions from prevented disease yielding net costs of ¥29,362.32 million, ¥29,334.29 million, and ¥13,524.72 million, respectively. All resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios fell below a 2x China GDP cost-effectiveness threshold across a range of potential vaccine prices. Discussion Initiation of a PCV13 NIP in China incurs large upfront costs but is good value for money, and is likely to prevent substantial cases of disease among children and non-vaccinated individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2883472138,"Introduction Pharmacological defatting of rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines suggests that the same method could be used to ameliorate macrovesicular steatosis in moderate to severely fatty livers. However there is no data assessing the effects of those drugs on primary human liver cells. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of a pharmacological cocktail in reducing the in vitro lipid content of primary human hepatocytes (PHH). In addition we sought to determine the cytotoxicity of the cocktail towards non-parenchymal liver cells. Methods Steatosis was induced in PHH by supplementation with a combination of saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids. This was followed by addition of a defatting drug cocktail for up to 48 hours. The same experimental method was used with human intra-hepatic endothelial cells (HIEC) and human cholangiocytes. MTT assay was used to assess cell viability, triglyceride quantification and oil red O staining were used to determine intracellular lipids content whilst ketone bodies were measured in the supernatants following experimentation. Results Incubation of fat loaded PHH with the drugs over 48 hours reduced the intracellular lipid area by 54%, from 12.85% to 5.99% (p = 0.002) (percentage of total oil red O area), and intracellular triglyceride by 35%, from 28.24 to 18.30 nmol/million of cells (p<0.001). Total supernatant ketone bodies increased 1.4-fold over 48 hours in the defatted PHH compared with vehicle controls (p = 0.002). Moreover incubation with the drugs for 48 hours increased the viability of PHH by 11%, cholangiocytes by 25% whilst having no cytotoxic effects on HIEC. Conclusion These data demonstrate that pharmacological intervention can significantly decrease intracellular lipid content of PHH, increase fatty acids β-oxidation whilst being non-toxic to PHH, HIEC or cholangiocytes."

Distinguishing between relapse and reinfection is crucial for patient counselling and to choose the most appropriate retreatment. Here, refined phylogenetic analysis using multiple genes served to assess genotype and reinfection for 53 patients for whom the virus was sampled before start of therapy and at time of sustained virological response evaluation at week 12. At baseline, genotypes were determined as HCV1a (41.5%), HCV1b (24.5%), HCV4 (18.9%) and HCV3a (15.1%), while six cases revealed to be discordantly assigned by phylogeny and commercial assays. Overall, 60.4% was co-infected with HIV. The large majority was classified as people who inject drugs (78.6%), often co-infected with HIV. Transmission was sexual in seven cases, of which five in HIV-positive men-who-have-sex-with-men. Overall, relapse was defined for 44 patients, while no conclusion was drawn for four patients. Five patients were reinfected with a different HCV strain, of which three with a different genotype, showing that phylogeny is needed not only to determine the genotype, but also to distinguish between relapse and intra-subtype reinfection. Of note, phylogenies are more reliable when longer fragments of the viral genome are being sequenced."
https://openalex.org/W2884221859,"Purpose Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is an effective therapy for selected groups of patients. We evaluated whether quantification of left atrium (LA) or pulmonary vein (PV) by using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) may predict the success rate of PV isolation procedure. Methods We included 118 patients younger than 65 years with symptomatic AF (73 paroxysmal, PAF; 45 non-paroxysmal, non-PAF). All patients underwent 256-slice MDCT prior to circumferential PV isolation to evaluate anatomy, volume and dimensions of LA and PV. Results After a mean follow-up of 14 months, complete success was achieved in 50 patients (68.5%) of PAF and in 26 patients (57.8%) of non-PAF. In the PAF group, total PV volume was found to be an independent predictor of AF recurrence, whereas LA volume was not. Logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of AF recurrence was higher in patients with total PV volume greater than 12.0 cm3/BSA (m2) (AUC 0.682, 95%CI 0.541―0.822). In the non-PAF group, no independent risk factor of LA or PV size was observed for the postoperative recurrence. Conclusions The PV volume quantification may predict the success of AF ablation in PAF patients."

https://openalex.org/W2883892535,"Caffeine has been considered a neuroprotective agent against Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent metabolomic analysis showed that levels of caffeine and its metabolites were decreased in sera from patients with PD compared with those from healthy controls. We focused on theophylline, which is one of the primary caffeine metabolites, as a candidate biomarker of PD because: (1) its serum level can be measured in hospital laboratories by standardized immunoassay kits for therapeutic drug monitoring and (2) because it is less markedly affected by caffeine intake. This was a pilot study to measure the levels of theophylline in sera of 31 patients with PD and 33 age-matched disease controls using an immunoassay kit. We confirmed the previous finding of significantly lower levels of serum theophylline in the PD group compared with control group (PD: 0.07±0.09 μg/mL, control: 0.18±0.24 μg/mL, p<0.05). Using such an approach of applying known medical biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases may allow us to skip the process from the discovery phase to clinical application, and subsequently shorten the period of time necessary for biomarker development."
https://openalex.org/W2883081266,"The proper development of atrioventricular (AV) valves is critical for heart morphogenesis and for the formation of the cardiac conduction system. Defects in AV valve development are the most common type of congenital heart defect. Cardiac troponin I (ctnni), a structural and regulatory protein involved in cardiac muscle contraction, is a subunit of the troponin complex, but the functions and molecular mechanisms of ctnni during early heart development remain unclear. We created a knockout zebrafish model in which troponin I type 1b (tnnilb) (Tnni-HC, heart and craniofacial) was deleted using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated protein system. In the homozygous mutant, the embryos showed severe pericardial edema, malformation of the heart tube, reduction of heart rate without contraction and with almost no blood flow, heart cavity congestion, and lack of an endocardial ring or valve leaflet, resulting in 88.8 ± 6.0% lethality at 7 d postfertilization. Deletion of tnni1b caused the abnormal expression of several markers involved in AV valve development, including bmp4, cspg2, has2, notch1b, spp1, and Alcam. Myocardial re-expression of tnni1b in mutants partially rescued the pericardial edema phenotype and AV canal (AVC) developmental defects. We further showed that tnni1b knockout in zebrafish and ctnni knockdown in rat h9c2 myocardial cells inhibited cardiac wnt signaling and that myocardial reactivation of wnt signaling partially rescued the abnormal expression of AVC markers caused by the tnnilb deletion. Taken together, our data suggest that tnni1b plays a vital role in zebrafish AV valve development by regulating the myocardial wnt signaling pathway.—Cai, C., Sang, C., Du, J., Jia, H., Tu, J., Wan, Q., Bao, B., Xie, S., Huang, Y., Li, A., Li, J., Yang, K., Wang, S., Lu, Q.

However, the relationship between mediastinal LNE and the prognosis of IPF has not been determined to date.This study included patients with IPF from the interstitial lung disease registry at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, from January 2012 to March 2016. Two thoracic radiologists independently reviewed mediastinal LNE and lung parenchymal fibrosis and ground glass opacities in chest computed tomography scans of each patient, which were obtained upon diagnosis. Mortality and admission rates were analyzed.In total, 132 patients (104 [78.8%] male; median age, 72 years; range, 51-84 years) were enrolled and 73 (55.3%) patients had mediastinal LNE (short axis ≥ 10 mm in diameter). Mortality was significantly higher among patients with LNE than among those without LNE (hazard ratio 2.26 [95% confidence interval 1.20-4.23], p = 0.011). Of the patients with LNE, 24.7% experienced acute exacerbation and 43.8% experienced hospital admission for respiratory causes, in comparison with 16.9% and 40.0% of patients without LNE respectively. Although patients with LNE had a tendency to have increased rate of acute exacerbation, it was not statistically significant.Mediastinal LNE in IPF is associated with increased mortality and its occurrence may be considered a poor prognostic factor in patients with IPF."
https://openalex.org/W2883412869,"Selectively recruiting bone marrow (BM)-derived stem and progenitor cells to injury sites is a promising therapeutic approach. The coordinated action of soluble factors is thought to trigger the mobilization of stem cells from the BM and recruit them to lesions to contribute to tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, the temporal response profile of the major cellular players and soluble factors involved in priming the BM and recruiting BM-derived cells to promote regeneration is unknown. We show that injury alters the BM cellular composition, introducing population-specific fluctuations during tissue regeneration. We demonstrate that injury causes an immediate, transient response of mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial cells followed by a nonoverlapping increase in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, BM reaction is identical whether the injury is inflicted on skin and muscle or also involves a bone defect, but these 2 injury paradigms trigger distinct systemic cytokine responses. Together, our results indicate that the BM response to injury in the early stages of regeneration is independent of the tissue-of-injury based on the 2 models used, but the injured tissue dictates the systemic cytokine response.—Leitão, L., Alves, C.

https://openalex.org/W2883459893,The aim of this study is the identification of a reliable predictor of prognosis to optimize the treatment of acute paraquat (PQ) poisoning patients. We performed a retrospective analysis on 96 patients with acute PQ poisoning to evaluate leucocyte count as a predictor of 90-day survival. These patients were admitted to the emergency department from May 2012 to February 2017. Kaplan–Meier method was used to compare the 90-day survival. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to analyze the discriminatory potential of leucocyte with respect to 90-day survival. Result showed that leucocyte was significantly higher among nonsurvivors than that among survivors (p<0.001). Leukocyte was also an independent predictor of survival according to the multivariate Cox analysis (HR 1.103; 95%CI: 1.062–1.146; p<0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) for leucocyte (AUC 0.911; 95%CI: 0.855–0.966; p<0.001) showed a discriminatory potential similar to that of the plasma PQ concentration (AUC 0.961; 95%CI: 0.926–0.997; p<0.001) in predicting 90-day survival. The leucocyte count is a strong predictor of survival in patients with acute PQ poisoning.
https://openalex.org/W2883480413,"As the first step of social information processing, visual encoding underlies the interpretation of social cues. Faces, in particular, convey a large amount of affective information, which can be subsequently used in the planning and production of adaptive social behaviors. Sociomoral reasoning is a specific social skill that is associated with engagement in appropriate social behaviors when faced with dilemmas. Previous studies using eye tracking suggest that visual encoding may play an important role in decision-making when individuals are faced with extreme moral dilemmas, but it is not known if this is generalizable to everyday situations. The main objective of this study was to assess the contribution of visual encoding to everyday sociomoral reasoning using eye tracking and ecological visual dilemmas. Participants completed the SocioMoral Reasoning Aptitude Level (SoMoral) task while their eye movements and pupil dilation were recorded. While visual encoding was not a predictor of sociomoral decision-making, sociomoral maturity was predicted by fixation count. Thus, in an ecological context, visual encoding of social cues appears to be associated with sociomoral maturity: the production of a justification is associated with volitional encoding strategies. Implications with regards to the dual-process theory of sociomoral reasoning and social information processing are discussed."

The development of such an assay is of major significance in order to replace currently-applied invasive methods containing inherent fetal loss risks. Methods We present a fast Temperature-Gradient Co-amplification at Lower Denaturation Temperature Polymerase Chain Reaction (fast TG COLD PCR) methodology for the detection of the paternally-inherited fetal alleles in maternal plasma. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7480526 (G/T) and rs968857 (G/A) that are located on the β-globin gene cluster and exhibit a high degree of heterozygosity in the Cypriot population were selected for evaluation. Seventeen maternal plasma samples from pregnancies at risk for β-thalassemia were analysed for the selected SNPs using the novel fast TG COLD PCR assay. Results Using fast TG COLD PCR, the paternally inherited allele in cell free fetal DNA was correctly determined for all the 17 maternal plasma samples tested, showing full agreement with the Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) analysis. Conclusions Our findings are encouraging and demonstrate the efficiency and sensitivity of fast TG COLD PCR in detecting the minor paternally-inherited fetal alleles in maternal plasma for the development of a NIPD assay for β-thalassaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2883613052,"To evaluate whether the presence of psoriasis increases the risk of keratopathy incidence by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).This retrospective cohort study used data from the NHIRD for the 2009 to 2012 period. A total of 3,648 patients diagnosed with psoriasis were enrolled in the study group while another 14,592 individuals were selected as the control group. The study group was propensity score-matched with a group of controls who had not received a diagnosis of psoriasis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of keratopathy. For the events of keratopathy, 71 patients in the study group and 208 patients in the control group developed keratopathy with a attributable risk of 23.43 per 100,000 person-months (incidence rate ratio = 1.40; P = 0.01) which correlated to the elevated cumulative probability (P = 0.03). The multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of keratopathy was higher in patients who had psoriasis (aHR = 1.31, P = 0.04). In addition, age older than 60 years (aHR = 2.10, P<0.01) and dry eye disease (aHR = 2.79, P<0.01) would also increase the risk of developing keratopathy.Psoriasis was associated with an increased risk of keratopathy in patients without preexisting prominent corneal disease. Moreover, the risk of incident keratopathy increases with exposure to psoriasis."

We also investigated the efficacy of leakage compensation from CA pre-load in brains from post-ischemic rat models without significant dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)-derived vessel wall permeability. DSC measurements were obtained using fast (0.3 s) echo-planar imaging in both normal rats and rats with transient middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO) (1-h MCAO, 24-h reperfusion) after successive administrations of gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem) and intravascular superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION). The relative cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) values acquired using Dotarem were significantly underestimated (~20%) when compared to those acquired using SPION in ipsilesional post-ischemic brain regions. A slight overestimation of relative mean transit time was observed. Areas with underestimated CBV and CBF values from the corresponding error maps encompassed the area of infarcted tissue (apparent diffusion coefficient < 500 μm2/s) and mostly coincided with the area wherein conspicuous longitudinal relaxation time differences were observed pre- vs. post-injection of Dotarem. The DSC measurements with significant pre-load (0.3 mmol·kg-1) of Dotarem displayed minimal perfusion deficits when compared to those determined using the reference intravascular SPION."

The formation of these secretory carriers at the trans-Golgi network is promoted by the protein kinase D (PKD) family of serine/threonine kinases. Here, using mathematical modeling and experimental validation of the PKD activation and substrate phosphorylation kinetics, we reveal that the expression level of the PKD substrate deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), a Rho GTPase–activating protein that is inhibited by PKD-mediated phosphorylation, determines PKD activity at the Golgi membranes. RNAi-mediated depletion of DLC1 reduced PKD activity in a Rho–Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)–dependent manner, impaired the exocytosis of the cargo protein horseradish peroxidase, and was associated with the accumulation of the small GTPase RAB6 on Golgi membranes, indicating a protein-trafficking defect. In summary, our findings reveal that DLC1 maintains basal activation of PKD at the Golgi and Golgi secretory activity, in part by down-regulating Rho–ROCK signaling. We propose that PKD senses cytoskeletal changes downstream of DLC1 to coordinate Rho signaling with Golgi secretory function.

Yet biodiversity representations are retained in many art and functional forms, including names of places, buildings, institutions and streets. These manifestations offer a window to examine the relationship between humans and their experienced or imagined environment using a biocultural lens. I quantified the current prevalence of urban streets named after animals or plant species, the diversity of species represented, whether they are native or non-native, whether representative of the biome in which the town was situated and the change in prevalence through time. The street names of 48 towns in a one degree wide south-north belt across seven of South African's biomes were captured and analysed. Of the 4,359 street names, 11.1% were named after plants (218 species) and 5.3% after animals (131 species), although some towns had none and others more than 40%. Approximately half of the plants were native to South Africa, whereas over 80% of the animals were. There was no correspondence between the species composition reflected in street names and the biome in which towns were located. The proportion of streets named after plants or animals has generally increased over the last two hundred years. These results provide insights into the bioculturally defined plants and animals that are valued by past and present urban communities, showing that they are generally from a wider array than can be found or experienced in the local setting."
https://openalex.org/W2884825566,"Our lab has previously shown that nitric oxide (NO) can alter the synaptic response properties of amacrine cells by releasing Cl- from internal acidic compartments. This alteration in the Cl- gradient brings about a positive shift in the reversal potential of the GABA-gated current, which can convert inhibitory synapses into excitatory synapses. Recently, we have shown that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel is involved in the Cl- release. Here, we test the hypothesis that (acidic) synaptic vesicles are a source of NO-releasable Cl- in chick retinal amacrine cells. If SVs are a source of Cl-, then depleting synaptic vesicles should decrease the nitric oxide-dependent shift in the reversal potential of the GABA-gated current. The efficacy of four inhibitors of dynamin (dynasore, Dyngo 4a, Dynole 34-2, and MiTMAB) were evaluated. In order to deplete synaptic vesicles, voltage-steps were used to activate V-gated Ca2+ channels and stimulate the synaptic vesicle cycle either under control conditions or after treatment with the dynamin inhibitors. Voltage-ramps were used to measure the NO-dependent shift in the reversal potential of the GABA-gated currents under both conditions. Our results reveal that activating the synaptic vesicle cycle in the presence of dynasore or Dyngo 4a blocked the NO-dependent shift in EGABA. However, we also discovered that some dynamin inhibitors reduced Ca2+ signaling and L-type Ca2+ currents. Conversely, dynasore also increased neurotransmitter release at autaptic sites. To further resolve the mechanism underlying the inhibition of the NO-dependent shift in the reversal potential for the GABA-gated currents, we also tested the effects of the clathrin assembly inhibitor Pitstop 2 and found that this compound also inhibited the shift. These data provide evidence that dynamin inhibitors have multiple effects on amacrine cell synaptic transmission. These data also suggest that inhibition of endocytosis disrupts the ability of NO to elicit Cl- release from internal stores which may in part be due to depletion of synaptic vesicles."
