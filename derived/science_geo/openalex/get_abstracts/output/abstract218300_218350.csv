https://openalex.org/W2033162427,"Pregnant albino mice were subjected to stress by crowding. When the litters encountered unfamiliar stimuli, they were less active, they were slower to respond, and they defecated less than control mice. These differences persisted at 30 and 100 days of age, whether the mice were raised by a crowded or by an uncrowded mother, and in spite of starvation. One explanation may be that aberrant endocrine activity in the crowded, pregnant female impairs the development of fetal response systems."

The results indicate a positive answer to the first question and an equivocal answer to the second."

https://openalex.org/W2104759859,"Investigations are in progress in this laboratory to elucidate the amino acid sequence of the proteolytic enzyme, papain (2). Results have already been presented on the isolation and sequence of some peptides obtained after chymotryptic digestion of oxidized papain (3-5). In the present paper, we report the isolation, composition, and sequence of some peptides produced by tryptic digestion of oxidized papain. Oxidized papain is not a completely suitable derivative for sequence studies inasmuch as the five tryptophan residues are destroyed during oxidation (6). Nevertheless, there are large portions of the molecule which are devoid of tryptophan, and it was anticipated that information could be obtained concerning these parts of the protein. The insolubility of oxidized papain necessitated prolonged digestion with trypsin, thereby magnifying possibilities of hydrolysis at residues other than lysine or arginine, whether catalyzed by trace amounts of chymotrypsin or by trypsin itself (7, 8). In this study, satisfactory resolution of peptides on Dowex 50-X2 was obtained with pyridine-acetate buffers. Comparison of the elution and resolution of peptides by this method and by the use of sodium buffers is given. An apparatus is described that gives satisfactory results for electrophoretic separation of peptides on paper. The data to be presented indicate that a number of the isolated peptides must have arisen from chymotryptic-like action, despite efforts to minimize such cleavage. Nevertheless, these peptides have contributed to our knowledge of the amino acid sequence of papain, and when the data are viewed in the light of other studies (4, 5), it becomes possible to identify a number of authentic tryptic fragments."

https://openalex.org/W1971106088,"Potassium accumulation occurred in leached slices of the inner medulla of the dog kidney incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C with glucose as substrate, but was blocked by inhibitors of glycolysis. Aerobically, only slight accumulation occurred with succinate as substrate at 37 degrees C, and this was blocked by dinitrophenol. These findings were in contrast to those obtained with kidney cortex slices under the same conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2151293003,The model of growth control advanced by Weiss and Kavanau has been further evaluated with an I.B.M. 7090 computer. Predictions for the concentration of growth-inhibiting substances and their quantitative distribution in the animal are in good agreement with known developmental changes. Results are being used to predict the course of compensatory organ growth in the immature animal.

https://openalex.org/W2169075608,"Peritoneal mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes) obtained from guinea pigs that had been treated with meprobamate do not support, in vitro, the intracellular growth of smooth Brucella abortus that is characteristic of monocytes from untreated animals. This modification of intracellular events appears to be due to an indirect action of the drug, since meprobamate does not produce any effects following direct exposure of monocytes or bacteria to the drug in vitro. Furthermore, the brucellacidal activity of serum from animals exposed to meprobamate is not increased. An interaction between monocytes and a component in the serum of animals exposed to meprobamate is required for the altered intracellular events."
https://openalex.org/W1965410524,"The autoradiographic technique was used on chromatograms containing adenosine diphosphate (ADP-P/sup 32/) and ADP-8-C/sup 14/. Adenosine diphosphate- 8-C/sup 14/ gave an intense exposure only on film 1, while ADP-P/sup 32/ darkened both films, the second film being twice as dark as the first. However, the relatively short half-life of P/sup 32/ (14.3 days) permits a resolution to be made after an appropriate decay. It was concluded that, in general, when C/sup 14/-P/sup 32/ or S/sup 35/ P/sup 32/ chromatograms contain only one radionuclide per spot, visual comparison of the two films permits a simple identification of the material. Under some conditions, doubly labeled spots may also be resolved. (P.C.H.)"

In the experiments reported here the bicarbonate was labelled with carbon-14 and the radioactive products formed during incubation were separated and located by chromatography followed by autoradiography."
https://openalex.org/W2027506915,"RECENTLY we reported1,2 an anticonvulsive effect of vitamin B12 and vitamin B6, and also the diminution of the aggressive behaviour induced by isolation by treatment with vitamin B 12 3. Other authors have noted an influence on the excitability of the central nervous system during measurements of chronaxie by vitamin B12 4. Furthermore, we know that vitamin B6 has a protective function against the neurotoxie effects of β-iminodiproprionitrile (IDPN)5, and that B6-avitaminosis causes inhibition of a conditioned response6."

https://openalex.org/W2088978221,"IN an investigation directed toward the evaluation of the relative effects of various chemotherapeutic chemicals or drugs on the carbohydrate metabolism of intact human cancer cells1, an unpredicted and unusual disappearance of glucose was noted when cells were incubated with 6-mercaptopurine. This effect was discernible under a variety of test conditions; incubation time varied from 1 to 3 hr.; cell concentrations varied from 60 × 106 to 230 × 106; chemical concentration varied from 5 to 50 µgm./106 cells. It was also discernible in all human cell types investigated; acute and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in ascites cells from patients with carcinoma of the ovaries. It is also readily demonstrated with tumour cell suspension obtained from a transplantable (in Sprague–Dawley rats) chloromyeloid leukaemia2. In all, this effect has been found without exception in some 30 separate examinations of human cancer cells."
