https://openalex.org/W2127435093,"Emerging infectious diseases are a major threat to health: AIDS, SARS, drug-resistant bacteria and Ebola virus are among the more recent examples. By identifying emerging disease 'hotspots', the thinking goes, it should be possible to spot health risks at an early stage and prepare containment strategies. An analysis of over 300 examples of disease emerging between 1940 and 2004 suggests that these hotspots can be accurately mapped based on socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors. The data show that the surveillance effort, and much current research spending, is concentrated in developed economies, yet the risk maps point to developing countries as the more likely source of new diseases. The origins of emerging infections diseases are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health1,2,3. Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID ‘events’ (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease ‘hotspots’). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate."

https://openalex.org/W2083456009,"Ischaemia of the heart, brain and limbs is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypoxia stimulates the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other angiogenic factors, leading to neovascularization and protection against ischaemic injury. Here we show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha), a potent metabolic sensor and regulator, is induced by a lack of nutrients and oxygen, and PGC-1alpha powerfully regulates VEGF expression and angiogenesis in cultured muscle cells and skeletal muscle in vivo. PGC-1alpha-/- mice show a striking failure to reconstitute blood flow in a normal manner to the limb after an ischaemic insult, whereas transgenic expression of PGC-1alpha in skeletal muscle is protective. Surprisingly, the induction of VEGF by PGC-1alpha does not involve the canonical hypoxia response pathway and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Instead, PGC-1alpha coactivates the orphan nuclear receptor ERR-alpha (oestrogen-related receptor-alpha) on conserved binding sites found in the promoter and in a cluster within the first intron of the VEGF gene. Thus, PGC-1alpha and ERR-alpha, major regulators of mitochondrial function in response to exercise and other stimuli, also control a novel angiogenic pathway that delivers needed oxygen and substrates. PGC-1alpha may provide a novel therapeutic target for treating ischaemic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2047550265,"The analysis of genome-wide patterns of variation in human populations can provide genetic evidence of patterns of human migration and adaptation across the world. Two contrasting papers in this issue illustrate the power of the method. By combining a large number of datasets, Lohmueller et al. obtain precise estimates of the number of deleterious mutations carried by each of 15 African-Americans and 20 European-Americans, resequenced across 11,000 genes. They find that individuals with a European background have more potentially damaging mutations lurking in their genomes than those with an African background. This is interpreted as a genetic legacy from the 'out-of-Africa' bottleneck that accompanied the peopling of Europe. Jakobsson et al. take a broader snapshot of human variation by examining 29 populations in the Human Genome Diversity Project. They obtain genotype data for over 500,000 markers in the human genome. Echoing the study of Americans with African and European backgrounds, these data reveal increasing linkage disequilibrium with increasing geographic distance from Africa. A report detailing genotype data for over 500,000 markers in the human genome by examining 29 populations in the Human Genome Diversity Project. Genome-wide patterns of variation across individuals provide a powerful source of data for uncovering the history of migration, range expansion, and adaptation of the human species. However, high-resolution surveys of variation in genotype, haplotype and copy number have generally focused on a small number of population groups1,2,3. Here we report the analysis of high-quality genotypes at 525,910 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 396 copy-number-variable loci in a worldwide sample of 29 populations. Analysis of SNP genotypes yields strongly supported fine-scale inferences about population structure. Increasing linkage disequilibrium is observed with increasing geographic distance from Africa, as expected under a serial founder effect for the out-of-Africa spread of human populations. New approaches for haplotype analysis produce inferences about population structure that complement results based on unphased SNPs. Despite a difference from SNPs in the frequency spectrum of the copy-number variants (CNVs) detected—including a comparatively large number of CNVs in previously unexamined populations from Oceania and the Americas—the global distribution of CNVs largely accords with population structure analyses for SNP data sets of similar size. Our results produce new inferences about inter-population variation, support the utility of CNVs in human population-genetic research, and serve as a genomic resource for human-genetic studies in diverse worldwide populations."

https://openalex.org/W2001036195,"Quantifying the number of deleterious mutations per diploid human genome is of crucial concern to both evolutionary and medical geneticists. Here we combine genome-wide polymorphism data from PCR-based exon resequencing, comparative genomic data across mammalian species, and protein structure predictions to estimate the number of functionally consequential single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) carried by each of 15 African American (AA) and 20 European American (EA) individuals. We find that AAs show significantly higher levels of nucleotide heterozygosity than do EAs for all categories of functional SNPs considered, including synonymous, non-synonymous, predicted 'benign', predicted 'possibly damaging' and predicted 'probably damaging' SNPs. This result is wholly consistent with previous work showing higher overall levels of nucleotide variation in African populations than in Europeans. EA individuals, in contrast, have significantly more genotypes homozygous for the derived allele at synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs and for the damaging allele at 'probably damaging' SNPs than AAs do. For SNPs segregating only in one population or the other, the proportion of non-synonymous SNPs is significantly higher in the EA sample (55.4%) than in the AA sample (47.0%; P < 2.3 x 10(-37)). We observe a similar proportional excess of SNPs that are inferred to be 'probably damaging' (15.9% in EA; 12.1% in AA; P < 3.3 x 10(-11)). Using extensive simulations, we show that this excess proportion of segregating damaging alleles in Europeans is probably a consequence of a bottleneck that Europeans experienced at about the time of the migration out of Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2112927642,"The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) belongs to Family B1 of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, and its natural agonist ligand is the peptide hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is involved in glucose homeostasis, and activation of GLP-1R in the plasma membrane of pancreatic β-cells potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion. The N-terminal extracellular domain (nGLP-1R) is an important ligand binding domain that binds GLP-1 and the homologous peptide Exendin-4 with differential affinity. Exendin-4 has a C-terminal extension of nine amino acid residues known as the “Trp cage”, which is absent in GLP-1. The Trp cage was believed to interact with nGLP-1R and thereby explain the superior affinity of Exendin-4. However, the molecular details that govern ligand binding and specificity of nGLP-1R remain undefined. Here we report the crystal structure of human nGLP-1R in complex with the antagonist Exendin-4(9–39) solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method to 2.2Å resolution. The structure reveals that Exendin-4(9–39) is an amphipathic α-helix forming both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with nGLP-1R. The Trp cage of Exendin-4 is not involved in binding to nGLP-1R. The hydrophobic binding site of nGLP-1R is defined by discontinuous segments including primarily a well defined α-helix in the N terminus of nGLP-1R and a loop between two antiparallel β-strands.

Peptide hormone binding of cloned Family B1 receptors has been investigated for 15 years by pharmacological and biochemical approaches. The current binding model is a two-step mechanism where initially the C-terminal part of the peptide ligand interacts with the Nt-domain of the receptor (6Lopez de Maturana R. Willshaw A. Kuntzsch A.

More recently, it was proposed that the Nt-domain of the secretin receptor was involved in the activation mechanism, but such an endogenous agonist mechanism has not been confirmed for GLP-1R (15Dong M. Pinon D.I. Asmann Y.W. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The isolated soluble Nt-domains are able to bind their cognate ligands, although the affinity is often reduced compared with the full-length receptors (1Perrin M.H. Fischer W.H. Kunitake K.S.

The GLP-1R Nt-domain is important for both ligand binding and specificity, and it determines almost exclusively the ability of the full-length GLP-1R to discriminate between glucagon and GLP-1 (16Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This is physiologically important, given the essentially opposite effects of glucagon and GLP-1 on blood glucose. Detailed structural information exists for ligand-bound forms of the Nt-domain of the mouse CRF receptor 2β (nCRF-R2β), the human PACAP receptor (nPAC1), and the human GIP receptor (nGIPR) (17Parthier, C., Kleinschmidt, M., Neumann, P., Rudolph, R., Manhart, S., Schlenzig, D., Fanghanel, J., Rahfeld, J.

The structures confirmed both the existence of a common structural fold and the interaction with the C-terminal part of their cognate ligands. Surprisingly, the binding site and orientation of PACAP(6–38) was completely different from the binding site and orientation of astressin and GIP. The soluble refolded nGLP-1R binds GLP-1 with lower affinity than the full-length GLP-1R in membranes, suggesting that high affinity binding of GLP-1 requires additional interaction with the core domain of GLP-1R (IC50 of 398 and 1.0 nm, respectively) (6Lopez de Maturana R. Willshaw A. Kuntzsch A. Rudolph R. Donnelly D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10195-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Specifically, the N-terminal part of GLP-1 is expected to interact with the first extracellular loop (ECL1) and the extracellular end of transmembrane helix 2 of GLP-1R (10Runge S. Gram C.

Lett. 2004; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Exendin-4 (Ex4) is homologous to GLP-1, and it binds and activates GLP-1R with similar affinity and potency as GLP-1 (20Goke R. Fehmann H.C. Linn T. Schmidt H. Krause M. Eng J. Goke B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to GLP-1, Ex4 maintains high affinity for nGLP-1R, comparable with that of the full-length GLP-1R (1.0 and 1.6 nm, respectively) (6Lopez de Maturana R. Willshaw A. Kuntzsch A. Rudolph R. Donnelly D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10195-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ex4 has a C-terminal extension of nine amino acid residues known as the Trp cage, which is absent in GLP-1. The NMR structure of Ex4 in aqueous trifluoroethanol (TFE) showed that the Trp cage folds back onto the central α-helical part of Ex4, forming the smallest known protein-like fold (21Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Andersen N.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 22Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Prickett K.S. Andersen N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13188-13200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The Trp cage was suggested to interact with nGLP-1R, thereby explaining the superior affinity of Ex4 compared with GLP-1 (23Al-Sabah S. Donnelly D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, recent results suggest that the Trp cage plays only a minor role in receptor binding (24Runge S. Schimmer S. Oschmann J. Schiodt C.B. Knudsen S.M. Jeppesen C.B. Madsen K. Lau J. Thogersen H. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5830-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Instead, the superior affinity of Ex4 was explained concomitantly by its superior α-helical propensity in solution and by superior interactions, due to specific divergent residues in the C-terminal part of GLP-1 and Ex4 (24Runge S. Schimmer S. Oschmann J. Schiodt C.B. Knudsen S.M. Jeppesen C.B. Madsen K. Lau J. Thogersen H. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5830-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the Trp cage in receptor binding is not crystal clear. Exendin-4(9–39) (Ex4(9–39)) is a competitive antagonist of GLP-1R, displacing both GLP-1 and Ex4 from receptor binding due to its high affinity interaction with nGLP-1R (IC50 of 0.6 nm) (6Lopez de Maturana R.

Morel P. Widmann C. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To increase the knowledge about ligand binding of GLP-1R and Family B1 receptors in general, we solved the crystal structure of the complex between nGLP-1R and Ex4(9–39) to 2.1 Å resolution. The structure provides for the first time molecular details of the initial ligand binding step of GLP-1R, and it gives a structural explanation of the differential affinity of nGLP-1R toward GLP-1 and Ex4. Protein and Peptide Preparation—The nGLP-1R was prepared as earlier described (24Runge S. Schimmer S. Oschmann J. Schiodt C.B. Knudsen S.M. Jeppesen C.B. Madsen K. Lau J. Thogersen H. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5830-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, N-terminal His6-tagged nGLP-1R was expressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, isolated as inclusion body protein, solubilized in guanidine HCl and dithiothreitol, dialyzed against guanidine HCl to remove the dithiothreitol, and refolded using L-Arg and a 1:5 molar ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Refolded nGLP-1R was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. Native Ex4(9–39)-amide was synthesized as previously described (16Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). [SeMet14,21]Ex4(9–39)-amide was synthesized by incorporation of selenomethionine (SeMet) residues using the Fmoc strategy on Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Fmoc-SeMet-OH was prepared by dissolving L(+)-selenomethionine (Acros Organics) in tetrahydrofurane/water with 1 equivalent of Na2CO3 and reacting with Fmoc-ONSu. The product was crystallized from ethyl acetate and n-heptan as off-white crystals with a slight odor of selenide. Purification and Crystallization of Ligand-bound nGLP-1R—The purified nGLP-1R was concentrated to 1 mg/ml and mixed with 2-fold molar excess of [SeMet14,21]Ex4(9–39) or Ex4(9–39). Ligand-bound nGLP-1R was purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex75 column running in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (supplemental Fig. S1). The eluted complex was characterized by SDS-PAGE and Trp fluorescence spectroscopy (data not shown). The complex was concentrated to 7 mg/ml and crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. The crystallization conditions was identified initially using the Crystal Screen and Detergent Screen from Hampton Research and subsequently optimized to 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m MgCl2, 0.4 m magnesium tartrate, and 9 mm n-decyl-β-d-thiomaltoside. Single crystals grew to a size of ∼0.5 × 0.1 × 0.1 μm, and they were frozen in liquid N2 using 25% glycerol in the cryo solution. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at three different wavelengths (peak, remote, inflection) at the MAX-lab beamline I911–3 (Lund, Sweden). The data were integrated and scaled using XDS (26Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar); the crystals belonged to space group P3121, with the unit cell dimensions a = b = 75.9 Å and c = 87.6 Å. The two selenium sites of [SeMet14,21]Ex4(9–39), the phases and initial electron density map were calculated using autoSHARP (27Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 215-230Google Scholar). The initial electron density map was of excellent quality and allowed automated building of 65% of the structural model by ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) (in the autoSHARP interface) with one complex in the asymmetric unit. The rest of the structural model was build manually without any ambiguity and refined (TLS and restrained) using COOT (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The final SeMet model has 124 residues in allowed and six residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, a working R-factor of 20.4%, and a free R-factor of 25.0%.

Schimmer S. Oschmann J. Schiodt C.B. Knudsen S.M. Jeppesen C.B. Madsen K. Lau J. Thogersen H. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5830-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We synthesized a selenium derivative of the ligand, where Met14 and Leu21 were substituted by SeMet: [SeMet14,21]Ex4(9–39). The solution NMR structure of Ex4 showed previously that Met14 and Leu21 were on the same face of the α-helix of Ex4 (22Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Prickett K.S. Andersen N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13188-13200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, structure/activity studies of GLP-1 showed that these two positions were not important for receptor binding (32Adelhorst K. Hedegaard B.B. Knudsen L.B. Kirk O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6275-6278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, [SeMet14,21]Ex4(9–39) displaced 125I-Ex4(9–39) from binding to the refolded nGLP-1R, with the same IC50 value as native Ex4(9–39) (IC50 = 5 nm, data not shown). The high affinity interaction allowed co-purification of nGLP-1R and [SeMet14,21]Ex4(9–39) by size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). The intrinsic Trp fluorescence properties of the eluted protein suggested a 1:1 complex (data not shown), where the ligand provided the heavy atoms necessary for the experimental phasing. The complex was crystallized in hanging drops, and the structure was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method to 2.2 Å resolution, using the absorption edge of the two selenium atoms in [SeMet14,21]Ex4(9–39). Subsequently, we crystallized and solved the structure of the complex with native Ex4(9–39) to 2.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement, using nGLP-1R from the initial SeMet structure as the search model (Protein Data Bank code 3C5T). The two structures were essentially identical except for Met14 and Leu21 of Ex4(9–39). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1, and all the figures illustrate the structure with the native ligand. The Structure of nGLP-1R—The core structure of nGLP-1R is similar to that of nCRF-R2β, nPAC1, and nGIPR, showing the three conserved disulfide bonds, two regions of antiparallel β-sheets (β-strand 1–5), and centrally positioned conserved residues Asp67, Trp72, Pro86, Arg102, Gly108, and Trp110 of nGLP-1R (Fig. 1, A and B) (18Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. Gulyas J. DiGruccio M.R. Cantle J.P. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4858-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Sun C. Song D. vis-Taber R.A. Barrett L.W. Scott V.E. Richardson P.L. Pereda-Lopez A. Uchic M.E. Solomon L.R. Lake M.R. Walter K.A. Hajduk P.J. Olejniczak E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7875-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The N terminus of nGLP-1R contains an α-helix similar to that of nGIPR, and the tertiary structure is stabilized by the disulfide bridges and by multiple intramolecular interactions between the secondary structure elements. The α-helix is defined by residues Leu32-Glu52 and includes Cys46, which forms a disulfide bridge with Cys71 on β-strand 2 (β2). The α-helix is terminated by three successive Pro residues (Pro54-Pro56) positioned at the beginning of loop 1 (Pro54-Phe61). The residues Cys62-Asp67 (β1) and Ala70-Gly75 (β2) constitute the first antiparallel β-sheet, although the backbone geometry is distorted around Arg64 and Pro73. β1 and β2 are separated by a short turn (turn 1, Glu68 and Tyr69). The side chain of Arg64 interacts with the dipole of the α-helix through hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Leu50 and Asp53 (supplemental Fig. S2). The positioning of the Arg64 side chain is further guided by a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Pro54 and by an ionic interaction with Asp74 of β2. The residues Gly78-Ser84 (β3), His99-Thr105 (β4), Leu109-Leu111 (β5), and Asp122 (β-bridge with β4) constitute the second region of antiparallel β-sheets. β3 and β4 are separated by a long well defined loop (loop 2, Pro86-Gly98) that is important for ligand binding (see below). The disulfide bridge between Cys62 and Cys104 connects the beginning of β1 and the end of β4. Cys85 is positioned at the end of β3 and forms a disulfide bridge with Cys126 in the C-terminal part of nGLP-1R. The segment from Leu109-Asp122 resembles a β-strand with an insertion of a flexible loop (loop 3, Gln112-Leu118). There was no detectable electron density for residues Arg24-Gln27 and Gly132-Tyr145. The human nGLP-1R contains seven Trp residues, and substitution of Trp39, Trp72, Trp91, Trp110, and Trp120 by Ala resulted in complete loss of binding of the full-length rat GLP-1R, whereas substitution of Trp87 had no apparent effect on binding or activation (33Wilmen A. Van E.B. Goke B. Goke R. Peptides. 1997; 18: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The role of Trp33, Trp39, Trp72, Trp91, and Trp110 is discussed below. Trp120 is not involved in ligand binding but appears to play a structural role by forming a well defined surface-exposed hydrophobic cluster together with Phe80, Tyr101, Phe103, and Leu111. Conserved Residues in the Nt-domain of Family B1 Receptors—The conserved Asp of nGLP-1R (Asp67) is centrally positioned, forming intramolecular interactions, as also observed for nCRF-R2β, nPAC1, and nGIPR, although the molecular details are slightly different in our crystal structure. Here, the side chain of Asp67 interacts indirectly via a water molecule with the side chain of Arg102 and directly with the side chain of Trp72 and Arg121 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the side chain and backbone of Asp67 interact with Tyr69 and Ala70, stabilizing the turn between β-strand 1 and 2. Gly108 has a structural function stabilizing the turn after β-strand 4 that allows the positioning of the Trp110 side chain below the Cys62-Cys104 disulfide bridge and above Arg102. Thereby, Arg102 is sandwiched between the side chains of Trp72 and Trp110 in a manner similar to nCRF-R2β. The importance of Asp67, Trp72, and Trp110 for ligand binding was previously documented by receptor mutagenesis (33Wilmen A. Van E.B. Goke B. Goke R. Peptides. 1997; 18: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Carruthers C.J. Unson C.G. Kim H.N. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pro86 at the beginning of loop 2 plays a structurally important role for the formation of the ligand binding site of nGLP-1R (see below). The side chain of Pro86 fills out a hydrophobic cavity formed by Tyr42 of the α-helix, Tyr69 of turn 1, Ala70 of β-strand 2, Val83 of β-strand 3, Val100 of β-strand 4, the Cys85-Cys126 disulfide bridge, and two residues of loop 2 itself, Tyr88 and Leu89 (supplemental Fig. S3). The Ligand and Its Interactions with nGLP-1R—Ex4(9–39) is a well defined α-helix from Leu10* to Asn28*, and the residues that interact with nGLP-1R lie within Glu15* and Ser32* (Fig. 1C) (throughout the text, ligand residues are designated with * and Ex4 is numbered 1–39). The residues Asp9*-Met14*donot interact with nGLP-1R. Glu15* is conserved in GLP-1 and Ex4, and it interacts favorably with the dipole of the α-helix of nGLP-1R via a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Leu32, the first residue in the α-helix of nGLP-1R. The amphipathic nature of the Glu16*-Lys27* segment enables hydrophobic interactions with nGLP-1R via one face of the α-helix and hydrophilic interactions via the other face of the α-helix. The hydrophilic face is defined by Glu16*, Glu17*, Arg20*, Glu24*, and Lys27*, of which only Arg20* and Lys27* interact directly with nGLP-1R (Fig. 2A). The side chain of Arg20* binds to the side chain of Glu128 of nGLP-1R, and the geometry is good for an ideal ionic interaction with two hydrogen bonds. Arg20* is nicely positioned by Glu16* and Glu17* in an arrangement that could stabilize the α-helical conformation of Ex4(9–39) itself, also in solution. In a similar arrangement, the side chain of Lys27* appears to interact with both the side chain of Glu127 of nGLP-1R and the side chain of Glu24*. In addition, the backbone carbonyl of Lys27* at the end of the α-helix forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg121 of nGLP-1R. After Lys27*, the B-factors were increasing toward the C terminus of the ligand and truncation of Pro31*-Ser39* showed only a minor effect on binding to nGLP-1R, suggesting that the most critical interactions lie within Glu15* and Lys27* (24Runge S. Schimmer S. Oschmann J. Schiodt C.B. Knudsen S.M. Jeppesen C.B. Madsen K. Lau J. Thogersen H. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5830-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the structure suggests that the side chain of Ser32* could form a hydrogen bond with Glu68 of nGLP-1R. The C-terminal tail after Ser32* of receptor-bound Ex4(9–39) probably folds back on the α-helix in a manner similar to the Trp cage conformation of Ex4 in TFE solution (22Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Prickett K.S. Andersen N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13188-13200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the electron density was very weak for the C terminus of Ex4(9–39) (Gly34*-Ser39*), indicating high mobility, and we were unable to build a representative structure of this part of the ligand. Accordingly, specific mutations in the C terminus of Ex4 were necessary to stabilize the Trp cage in aqueous solution, where it was otherwise only partially populated (21Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Andersen N.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the specific Trp cage conformation is not stabilized in the receptor-bound state of Ex4(9–39) and that Ser33*-Ser39* does not interact specifically with nGLP-1R. The hydrophobic face of Ex4(9–39) is defined by residues Ala18*, Val19*, Phe22*, Ile23*, Trp25*, Leu26*, and Pro31* (Fig. 2B). Of these, Val19*, Phe22*, Ile23*, and Leu26* are buried by the hydrophobic interaction with nGLP-1R and they are the residues of the ligand with the lowest B-factors. Phe22* of Ex4(9–39)"

https://openalex.org/W2051369945,"The bacterial adhesive protein, FimH, is the most common adhesin of Escherichia coli and mediates weak adhesion at low flow but strong adhesion at high flow. There is evidence that this occurs because FimH forms catch bonds, defined as bonds that are strengthened by tensile mechanical force. Here, we applied force to single isolated FimH bonds with an atomic force microscope in order to test this directly. If force was loaded slowly, most of the bonds broke up at low force (<60 piconewtons of rupture force). However, when force was loaded rapidly, all bonds survived until much higher force (140-180 piconewtons of rupture force), behavior that indicates a catch bond. Structural mutations or pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody, both of which allosterically stabilize a high affinity conformation of FimH, cause all bonds to survive until high forces regardless of the rate at which force is applied. Pretreatment of FimH bonds with intermediate force has the same strengthening effect on the bonds. This demonstrates that FimH forms catch bonds and that tensile force induces an allosteric switch to the high affinity, strong binding conformation of the adhesin. The catch bond behavior of FimH, the amount of force needed to regulate FimH, and the allosteric mechanism all provide insight into how bacteria bind and form biofilms in fluid flow. Additionally, these observations may provide a means for designing antiadhesive mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2152602238,"The extrasolar planet HD 209458b is surrounded by a vast cloud of atomic hydrogen, covering a region larger than the stellar disk. A spectral line observed when the planet passed in front of its host star revealed the presence of high-velocity atomic hydrogen a great distance away from the planet, and this was interpreted as hydrogen atoms escaping from the planet's exosphere and being accelerated by stellar radiation pressure. Starting from the fact that energetic neutral atoms are seen in the Solar System wherever energetic ions from the solar wind encounter a neutral planetary atmosphere, Holmström et al. have developed an alternative model. In this, stellar wind particles pick up electrons from neutral hydrogen in the planet's exosphere to generate energetic neutral atoms. The extrasolar planet HD 209458b has high-velocity atomic hydrogen at great distances from it; this observation can be explained by stellar wind particles picking up electrons from neutral hydrogen in the planet's exosphere. Absorption in the stellar Lyman-α (Lyα) line observed during the transit of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b in front of its host star reveals high-velocity atomic hydrogen at great distances from the planet1,2. This has been interpreted as hydrogen atoms escaping from the planet’s exosphere1,3, possibly undergoing hydrodynamic blow-off4, and being accelerated by stellar radiation pressure. Energetic neutral atoms around Solar System planets have been observed to form from charge exchange between solar wind protons and neutral hydrogen from the planetary exospheres5,6,7, however, and this process also should occur around extrasolar planets. Here we show that the measured transit-associated Lyα absorption can be explained by the interaction between the exosphere of HD 209458b and the stellar wind, and that radiation pressure alone cannot explain the observations. As the stellar wind protons are the source of the observed energetic neutral atoms, this provides a way of probing stellar wind conditions, and our model suggests a slow and hot stellar wind near HD 209458b at the time of the observations."
https://openalex.org/W2037151930,"Interferons regulate diverse immune functions through the transcriptional activation of hundreds of genes involved in anti-viral responses. The interferon-inducible ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 is expressed in cells in response to a variety of stress conditions like viral or bacterial infection and is present in its free form or is conjugated to cellular proteins. In addition, protein ubiquitination plays a regulatory role in the immune system. Many viruses modulate the ubiquitin (Ub) pathway to alter cellular signaling and the antiviral response. Ubiquitination of retroviral group-specific antigen precursors and matrix proteins of the Ebola, vesicular stomatitis, and rabies viruses by Nedd4 family HECT domain E3 ligases is an important step in facilitating viral release. We found that Nedd4 is negatively regulated by ISG15. Free ISG15 specifically bound to Nedd4 and blocked its interaction with Ub-E2 molecules, thus preventing further Ub transfer from E2 to E3. Furthermore, overexpression of ISG15 diminished the ability of Nedd4 to ubiquitinate viral matrix proteins and led to a decrease in the release of Ebola VP40 virus-like particles from the cells. These results point to a mechanistically novel function of ISG15 in the enhancement of the innate anti-viral response through specific inhibition of Nedd4 Ub-E3 activity. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a Ub-like protein with the ability to interfere with Ub-E2 and E3 interaction to inhibit protein ubiquitination."

https://openalex.org/W2126406928,"A relationship exists between nuclear architecture and gene activity and it has been proposed that the activity of ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription determines genome organization in the mammalian cell nucleus. Recently developed 3C and 4C technology allowed us to test the importance of transcription for nuclear architecture. We demonstrate that upon transcription inhibition binding of RNA polymerase II to gene regulatory elements is severely reduced. However, contacts between regulatory DNA elements and genes in the β-globin locus are unaffected and the locus still interacts with the same genomic regions elsewhere on the chromosome. This is a general phenomenon since the great majority of intra- and interchromosomal interactions with the ubiquitously expressed Rad23a gene are also not affected. Our data demonstrate that without transcription the organization and modification of nucleosomes at active loci and the local binding of specific trans-acting factors is unaltered. We propose that these parameters, more than transcription or RNA polymerase II binding, determine the maintenance of long-range DNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2147333597,"SDS-PAGE is a basic method that has long been used for separation of proteins according to their molecular sizes. Despite its simplicity, it provides information on characteristics of proteins beyond their molecular masses because gel mobility of proteins often reflects their physicochemical properties and post-translational modifications. Here we report on a global analysis of gel mobility of the proteome, which we term the “mobilitome,” covering 93.4% of the fission yeast proteome. To our surprise, more than 40% of proteins did not migrate to their calculated positions. Statistical analyses revealed that the discrepancy was largely dependent on the hydrophobicity of proteins. This experimental data set, with a high coverage rate of real mobility, made it feasible to identify proteins detected on the gel without using any specialized techniques. This approach enabled us to detect previously unknown post-translational modifications of a protein; for example, we revealed that eIF5A is novel substrate of a Sir2-related deacetylase Hst2. Furthermore, we concomitantly identified twelve acetylated and eight methylated proteins using specific anti-acetylated and anti-methylated lysine antibodies, most of which had not been known to be subject to the modifications. Thus, we propose the general usefulness of the mobilitome and electrophoresis-based methodology for the identification and characterization of proteins detected on the gel.

Thus, we propose the general usefulness of the mobilitome and electrophoresis-based methodology for the identification and characterization of proteins detected on the gel. Gel mobility analysis of proteins often provides useful information on their physicochemical properties and post-translational modifications and can sometimes provide important insights into the function and regulation of a given protein. SDS-PAGE has been long and widely used for separation and size determination of proteins. In the early 1960s, polyacrylamide gels became appreciated as a convenient and versatile alternative to starch gels (1Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar, 2Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar). It was subsequently demonstrated that in the presence of SDS, proteins migrate according to the molecular weight of their polypeptide chains (3Shapiro A.L. Vinuela E. Maizel Jr., J.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (2653) Google Scholar, 4Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the band resolution of the technique was relatively low. Therefore, this system, which uses only one phosphate buffer for the tanks and the gel, has lost its popularity despite its simplicity. Meanwhile, Laemmli modified the Ornstein and Davis system by adding SDS to the Tris/glycine buffer, in which a nonrestrictive large pore gel called a stacking gel is put on the top of a separating gel, and showed that proteins could be reliably separated with high resolution (1Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar, 2Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar, 5Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). As is well known, the Laemmli modification of the Ornstein and Davis system has become a mainstream technique for protein separation. Identification of a protein detected on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel is a critical step for biochemical studies. Recent advances in analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, as well as the accumulation of genome information, have enabled systematic identification of proteins on a gel. Despite the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry, however, it is still difficult to identify the proteins when they are present in low abundance, highly modified, or impure. Therefore, in addition to these forward proteomic techniques, a reverse proteomic approach based on the set of all identified genes would be useful. The genome sequence of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was completed in 2002 (6Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N. Hayles J. Baker S.

Recently, we established a proteome resource by expressing the ORFeome 4The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; WB, Western blotting; GRAVY, grand average hydrophobicity; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; MM, minimal medium; EF, elongation factor; eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor. of S. pombe at moderate to high levels under the control of the inducible promoter nmt1 (7Matsuyama A.

In the present study, we report electrophoresis-based analyses of the fission yeast proteome, including the collection of information regarding gel mobility of the proteome. This unique data set enables one to identify an unknown target protein detected on a gel, even if it is hard to identify by classical purification-based methods. Furthermore, we identified several novel acetylated or methylated proteins, using a global screen based on induced expression of the tagged proteins in combination with Western blotting (WB). S. pombe Strains and Media—S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. A series of S. pombe strains in which each ORF is fused with two FLAG epitopes and a hexahistidine tag was integrated at the leu1 locus were derived from AM2 (7Matsuyama A. Arai R. Yashiroda Y.

(1974) in Handbook of Genetics (King, R., ed) pp. 395-446, Plenum Publishing Corp., New YorkGoogle Scholar). A high efficiency protocol for transformation of S. pombe cells, as described previously (12Matsuyama A. Yabana N. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 539-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was modified to the 96-well plate format. The cells were freshly grown in complete medium YE, harvested, and washed with and then resuspended in 0.1 m lithium acetate solution (pH 5.0). One microgram of salmon sperm DNA was added as carrier DNA into each 30-μl cell suspension. For chromosomal integration of pDUAL-FFH1 (13Matsuyama A. Shirai A. Yashiroda Y. Kamata A. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 1289-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and its derivatives, each DNA was digested with NotI, SacII, or ApaI in a volume of 12 μl, and 4 μl of the resultant solution was used directly. Sample DNA, together with 90 μl of 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, was added immediately to the cell suspension, and the mix was incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min. After the addition of 12 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, the cells were heated at 42 °C for 15 min, spun down, resuspended in water, and plated on the SD selective medium. For gene induction, the cells harboring a testing plasmid or integrants were pregrown on the SD plate, and parts of them were subsequently streaked on the MM plate and grown for 22 h at 30 °C. The cells were then harvested and used for the subsequent experiments. Measurement of Gel Mobility of Proteins in SDS-PAGE—Total cell lysates were prepared by the post-alkaline method described by V. V. Kushnirov (14Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) with slight modification (15Shirai, A., Matsuyama, A., Yashiroda, Y., Arai, R., and Yoshida, M. (2006) Nat. Protocols 10.1038/nprot.2006.191Google Scholar). Cultures of tagged strains grown on MM plates for 22 h at 30 °C were harvested in 25 μl of MM medium and placed in 96-well plates. Forty microliters of 0.4 n NaOH were added into the suspension. The cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, pelleted, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS gel loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots of 10 μl of the SDS-lysed extracts were loaded on a 28-well, 9 × 15 cm, 5-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Craft). The proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and then blocked for 1 h with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBST (1× phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) before primary antibodies were applied. A polyclonal anti-His tag antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.) or a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), diluted with PBST (1:6,000) was incubated as a primary antibody with the membrane over night. The membrane was washed with PBST three times and incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody, an IRDye™800CW-conjugated anti-rabbit (-mouse) IgG antibody (Rockland), diluted 1:10,000 with PBST. After washing with PBST, the His6 (FLAG)-tagged proteins were detected using the Odyssey® imaging system (LI-COR). As a control, a protein marker lane containing a mixture of Precision Plus Protein™ Standards, all blue (Bio-Rad), and BenchMark™ Protein Ladder (Invitrogen) was included in each gel. Before measurement of gel mobility of proteins in SDS-PAGE, we analyzed the correlation between gel mobility of each band of the BenchMark™ Protein Ladder visualized by an anti-His tag antibody and its molecular mass in each membrane (Pearson product moment correlation coefficient rxy > 0.99) and calculated the regression equation for each membrane. The apparent molecular masses of almost all proteins predicted in fission yeast were measured from gel mobility on SDS-PAGE according to these regression equations. The gel mobility of each gene product was initially determined using one integrant. When no positive band was detected in WB, another integrant was analyzed. Cells transformed with a multicopy plasmid were used only when no signal was obtained in WB using integrants. Antibodies Used in This Study—The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the His6 tag and the HA epitope were purchased from MBL. The mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 was purchased from Sigma. The mouse monoclonal antibodies against an acetylated lysine and a methylated lysine (clones AKL5C1 and MEK3D7, respectively) were described elsewhere (16Komatsu Y. Yukutake Y. Yoshida M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 272: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S.

Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4653-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Data Source and Bioinformatics Analyses—Protein sequence information was retrieved from the S. pombe GeneDB data base (The Sanger Centre). The presence of signal sequences was calculated by using PSORT II (19Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Grouping by subcellular localization of proteins was performed according to the analysis of Matsuyama et al. (7Matsuyama A. Arai R. Yashiroda Y. Shirai A. Kamata A. Sekido S. Kobayashi Y. Hashimoto A. Hamamoto M. Hiraoka Y. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). SYSTAT 10.2 (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA) was used for statistical analyses. We calculated p values using the Mann-Whitney test for analyzing the relationship between gel mobility and the GRAVY score or isoelectric point of proteins, as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for analyzing the relationship between gel mobility of proteins and their subcellular localization. The results were further corrected for multiple hypothesis testing by applying the Bonferroni correction. Meanwhile, the relationship between the calculated and apparent molecular masses was analyzed by the Bonferroni-adjusted Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test.

The Mobilitome, an “-omic” Data Set Based on Gel Mobility of Proteins—To set up a strategy for global analysis of gel mobility of proteins in SDS-PAGE, we constructed S. pombe integrants in which each of the ORFs fused with two copies of the FLAG epitope and six consecutive histidine residues tag (His6) at the 3′ terminus is integrated at the chromosomal leu1 locus (13Matsuyama A. Shirai A. Yashiroda Y. Kamata A. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 1289-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A). This strain collection was established based on a Gateway-cloned ORFeome resource that covered more than 99% of genes predicted by the genome project (7Matsuyama A. Arai R. Yashiroda Y. Shirai A. Kamata A. Sekido S. Kobayashi Y. Hashimoto A. Hamamoto M. Hiraoka Y. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). All ORFs were expressed under the thiamine-regulatable nmt1 promoter (20Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Each protein, expressed in cells grown in MM, was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 5-20% gradient gel. Gel mobility was measured by WB, using either an anti-His tag antibody (supplemental Fig. S1B) or an anti-FLAG antibody. In those cases where the signal was below detectable levels, we overexpressed the ORFs from multicopy plasmids to improve detection (13Matsuyama A. Shirai A. Yashiroda Y. Kamata A. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 1289-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus far, we have determined the gel mobility of 4,622 proteins, corresponding to 93.4% of all gene products predicted in the genome (supplemental Table S2), thereby establishing the “mobilitome,” a novel “-omic” data set of gel mobility of the proteome. The mobilitome includes not only the gel mobilities of main populations of proteins but also those of additional minor populations when observed. The overall size distribution of proteins measured by gel mobility was not significantly different from that of proteins calculated from their amino acid sequences (p = 0.060, as determined by the Mann-Whitney U test) (supplemental Fig. S2). When the sizes were compared one by one, however, more than 40% of the gene products did not migrate within 10% of the predicted position (calculated each ORF size plus 4.48 kDa for the tag) (Fig. 1), and there was a significant difference between the calculated molecular mass (Mcal) and the apparent molecular mass (Mapp) (p < 1 × 10-8, as determined by the Wilcoxon signed rank test). This result indicates that it is difficult to predict gel mobility of proteins in SDS-PAGE solely from their amino acid sequences. Gel mobility is influenced by various properties of proteins. Among them, the hydrophobicity denoted by the GRAVY score (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) had the greatest influence on gel mobility. Statistical analysis revealed that hydrophilic proteins tend to slow migration, whereas gel mobility of a protein became steadily greater as its GRAVY score increased (Fig. 2A). Reciprocally, proteins with greater mobility tend to have a high GRAVY score, whereas those with lower mobility have a low score (p < 1 × 10-8) (Fig. 2B). This tendency is probably due to the manner in which SDS binds to proteins. In general, SDS binds to a protein at a ratio of approximately one molecule/two amino acid residues (22Pitt-Rivers R. Impiombato F.S. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 23Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5161-5165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because this binding is mediated via the hydrophobic interaction, SDS preferentially binds to the hydrophobic region of proteins (24Robinson N.C. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As a result, it is likely that hydrophobic proteins bind higher amounts of SDS than hydrophilic ones and therefore migrate faster in SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the isoelectric points of proteins also influenced gel mobility to some extent. Acidic proteins (those for which isoelectric points are less than 6.0) exhibited mobility smaller than calculated (p < 1 × 10-7) (supplemental Fig. S3); this may be due to negative charge repulsion with SDS. Although proteins showed these physicochemical properties on the whole, there were a significant number of proteins that did not match this pattern. For instance, there was a population of hydrophobic proteins with much lower mobility than predicted. It seems possible that these proteins are subject to post-translational modifications that affect their mobility. Indeed, of seven hydrophobic proteins (GRAVY score > 0.5) that have so far been reported to be glycosylated in fission yeast, five proteins showed much lower mobility than predicted. Although the remaining two did not show such the slow migration, both proteins were accompanied by additional slowly migrating minor bands, which might be derived from glycosylation (data not shown). In addition to these characteristics, the molecular or functional characteristics of proteins such as subcellular localization seemed to have a significant influence on gel mobility. For instance, cytosolic proteins migrated in accordance with the prediction, whereas most nucleolar proteins were likely to migrate more slowly than expected. In contrast, proteins localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the Golgi apparatus showed a tendency to migrate faster than calculated (Fig. 2C). Those proteins for which gel mobility was hard to predict were biased toward proteins that localize at the cell surface or membrane. It seems possible that this inconsistency could be mainly ascribed to the hydrophobicity of the proteins and the post-translational modifications as mentioned above. More remarkably, many proteins that are localized in the ER or the Golgi apparatus had a high GRAVY score, thereby migrating fast in SDS-PAGE, whereas nucleolar proteins are generally hydrophilic, which may lead to slower migration (Fig. 2D). It is known that many ER proteins have hydrophobic signal sequences that are cleaved off prior to translocation. Therefore, one would predict that the high mobility of ER proteins is likely to be caused by their signal sequences rather than their hydrophobicity. However, statistical analysis revealed that distribution of gel mobilities of ER proteins having predicted signal sequences was similar to that of ER proteins lacking them (p = 0.23, as determined by the Mann-Whitney U test) (supplemental Fig. S4A). Similarly, mitochondrial proteins migrated relatively quickly compared with their predicted mobilities, although these proteins are not as hydrophobic as ER and Golgi proteins. Furthermore, the distribution of gel mobilities of mitochondrial proteins having predicted signal sequences was similar to that of the mitochondrial proteins lacking them (p = 0.10, as determined by the Mann-Whitney U test) (supplemental Fig. S4B). The reason for this difference is still unclear, but it seems possible that unknown mitochondrion-specific protein processing or post-translational modification could be involved. In addition to the variation of gel mobility of the main bands, we detected 1,304 proteins (28.2% of proteins with positive signals) that exhibited additional minor populations migrating slower than the main bands. Slowly migrating populations showed various patterns that contained either a discrete band, a smear, or a ladder, as well as combinations of these simpler patterns, suggestive of post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and glycosylation (25Cook L.B. Zhu C.C. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1777-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Poly W.J. Comp Biochem. Physiol. A Physiol. 1997; 118: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Zhu C.C. Cook L.B. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28228-28237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (data not shown). On the other hand, minor bands supposed to be degraded intermediates that migrated faster than the main populations were observed in 2,339 proteins (48.1%) (data not shown). Of these quickly migrating populations, some may have a significant role in the biological process, although it is difficult to distinguish them from merely degraded intermediates, unlike the slowly migrating populations. The use of the strong nmt1 promoter for gene expression could raise a risk of forced expression of proteins that are not abundant in normal physiological conditions, which could induce unexpected proteolytic cleavage of expressed proteins. Therefore, it seemed possible that the high mobility of some proteins is caused by their unexpected degradation. To assess this possibility, we examined the relationship between the presence of quickly migrating minor bands and gel mobility of the main bands. Unexpectedly, however, statistical analysis revealed that proteins exhibiting additional quickly migrating minor populations migrated slightly slower than proteins with no such populations (p = 1.4 × 10-7, as determined by the Mann-Whitney U test, supplemental Fig. S5), although the difference was very small. These results suggest that it is unlikely that the unexpected degradation caused by forced expression is the major reason for the higher mobility of proteins than predicted. Identification of Target Proteins Using the Mobilitome Data Set—The global mobility data base we developed enables one to rapidly identify a protein on the gel. Given an unknown protein of interest detected by a standard procedure, candidates for this protein can be chosen using the mobilitome, based on the real value of gel mobility, and the transformants expressing tagged candidates can be then analyzed. Analyzing each candidate one by one in the same way as the first detection will easily lead to the identification of the target, because the sample containing the target protein is expected to show twin bands when detected, one of which is the endogenous protein, and the other of which is the transgene product, for which mobility is slightly shifted by the addition of the small C-terminal tags. For this methodology, we set up a website that allows searching for candidates by using gel mobility data of target proteins. As a proof of principle, we tried to identify an S. pombe protein detected by an anti-HA tag antibody. This protein was observed as a background band with a size of ∼106.5 kDa when the total cell lysate was blotted with anti-HA (Fig. 3A). We searched for candidates for this 106.5 kDa (±5%) in the mobilitome data base and retrieved 115 proteins. We next analyzed the total cell lysate of each candidate strain by the same way as the mobilitome but instead using the anti-HA antibody. As a result of the screen of 115 candidates, we rapidly identified two ORFs that gave twin bands (Fig. 3B). These two clones contained ORFs encoding the same protein, translation elongation factor 2 (EF2). We found a partially matched HA epitope sequence (VPDY) in EF2. We next tested whether the sequence is responsible for the antibody reactivity by introducing a mutation. The mutant EF2-GA having a sequence (VGAY) lost the reactivity to the antibody (supplemental Fig. S6), showing that the VPDY sequence acts as the HA epitope in EF2. Although it seems possible that a similar methodology could be applied to the existing sequence data base, it would not be practical, because of the low coincidence between Mcal and Mapp. Indeed, proteins that migrated with Mapp within 5% of Mcal account for only 33.6% of the proteome, indicating that only one-third of targets could be identified. If a similar methodology were to be used for the identification of this protein based on existing sequence data bases and predicted ORF sizes alone, at least 306 clones would need to be tested, because of the low coincidence between Mcal and Mapp (Fig. 3C). To apply this methodology to the identification of novel acetylated proteins, we screened for proteins responsible for the two bands found only in the disruptant of the hst2 gene, encoding an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase (28North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), using an anti-acetyllysine antibody (Fig. 4A). Mapp of these acetylated proteins were estimated as 22.1 and 22.0 kDa, respectively, in WB using an anti-acetyllysine antibody. A screen of 177 candidates from the mobilitome data base with mobilities within ±5% of 22.0-22.1 kDa (Fig. 4D) resulted in the identification of two proteins, Tif51 and Tif512 (29Linder P. Vornlocher H.P. Hershey J.W. McCarthy J.E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 865-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are closely related paralogs of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) (Fig. 4, B and C). In this case, to identify Tif51 and Tif512 using the sequence data base, it would have been necessary to search for proteins within ±25% of Mapp, which corresponds to nearly one-sixth of the proteome (Fig. 4D). Although acetylation of eIF5A has been previously reported in other organisms (30Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y. Ball H. Pei J. Cheng T. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. Grishin N.V. White M. Yang X.J.

Here, we present the first ATPase cycle for the mitochondrial member of the Hsp90 family called Trap1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1). Using biochemical, thermodynamic, and rapid kinetic methods we dissected the kinetics of the nucleotide-regulated rearrangements between the open and the closed conformations. Surprisingly, upon ATP binding, Trap1 shifts predominantly to the closed conformation (70%), but, unlike cytosolic Hsp90 from yeast, this process is rather slow at 0.076 s-1. Because reopening (0.034 s-1) is about ten times faster than hydrolysis (khyd = 0.0039 s-1), which is the rate-limiting step, Trap1 is not able to commit ATP to hydrolysis. The proposed ATPase cycle was further scrutinized by a global fitting procedure that utilizes all relevant experimental data simultaneously. This analysis corroborates our model of a two-step binding mechanism of ATP followed by irreversible ATP hydrolysis and a one-step product (ADP) release.

The dependence on Hsp90 apparently reflects the relative complexity of the organism. For example, bacteria lacking HtpG (the prokaryotic homolog of mammalian Hsp90) appear to be fully viable (1Bardwell J.C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The family of Hsp90-related molecular chaperones mediates protein folding, assembly, and stability of a variety of substrate proteins in vivo. In vitro, Hsp90 suppresses the aggregation of non-native proteins (6Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and can also promote the refolding of substrates in cooperation with the Hsp70 system (7Dittmar K.D.

(2005) in Protein Folding Handbook (Buchner, J., and Kiefhaber, T., eds) pp. 768-810, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co., Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar). The organellar versions differ from their cytosolic counterparts in several aspects. The most striking is that they seem to lack specific co-chaperones. While Grp94, the Hsp90 homolog of the endoplasmic reticulum has evolved from its cytosolic counterpart, Trap1, the mitochondrial version, is a descendent of prokaryotic Hsp90 (11Richter, K., Meinlschmidt, B., and Buchner, J. (2005) in Protein Folding Handbook (Buchner, J., and Kiefhaber, T., eds) pp. 768-810, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co., Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar). Whether they share a general mechanism of ATP hydrolysis is not known. In this study, we focused on the biochemical and kinetic analysis of the Hsp90 homolog Trap1, which is localized in mitochondria (12Felts S.J. Owen B.A.L. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J.

Originally, Trap1 was identified as a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein (15Song H.Y. Dunbar J.D. Zhang Y.X. Guo D.Q. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Trap1 is 31% identical to human Hsp90, 34% to Escherichia coli HtpG, 33% to yeast Hsp90, and 31% to Grp94. For the N-terminal ATP-binding domain alone, the identities are even higher. There are a few identified Trap1 substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (16Chen C.F. Chen Y.M. Dai K. Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4691-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the tumor suppressor EXT proteins (17Simmons A.D. Musy M.M. Lopes C.S. Hwang L.Y. Yang Y.P. Lovett M. Hum. Mol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Recently, an interaction partner of Trap1, which is located inside mitochondria, was reported (19Kang B.H. Plescia J. Dohi T. Rosa J. Doxsey S.J. Altieri D.C.

Cyclophilin D, which is responsible for mitochondrial cell death, binds to Trap1 so that its function upon stress is prevented. This protective pathway, which is mainly detected in tumor cells, can be disrupted by adding the known Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin or 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin.It has been established for members of the Hsp90 family that ATP binding and hydrolysis are essential for their in vivo function (20Scheibel T.

The web site (www.hsp90.org) provides a comprehensive overview of this research field as well as meetings for the community interested in Hsp90. Because of its involvement in cell cycle regulation, Hsp90 is currently evaluated as a target for anti-cancer drugs. At the moment, mainly natural compounds such as radicicol (RA) and geldanamycin and their derivatives are tested in this context (24Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U.

These compounds are inhibitors that bind to the ATP binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 and thus compete with nucleotides for the binding site. Binding of the inhibitors to Hsp90 leads to the release of bound client proteins and thus to loss of protection/folding assistance (39Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). The specificity of these drugs for Hsp90 is based on the peculiar structure of nucleotide bound to Hsp90 (23Prodromou C.

The kinetics of the ATPase cycle of yeast Hsp90 (40Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), human Hsp90 (41McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 35612-35620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) had already been investigated in some detail using biochemical approaches. Yeast Hsp90 was observed by biochemical and crystallographic studies to undergo a conformational change upon ATP binding resulting in the so-called closed conformation in which the N-terminal domains are transiently associated (43Richter K. Moser S. Hagn F. Friedrich R. Hainzl O. Heller M. Schlee S. Kessler H. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). However, the rate constants of this step were not accessible (40Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).In contrast, even after ATP binding Grp94 stays predominately in the open conformation and thus does not allow to gather direct information about this key step of the cycle (42Frey S. Leskovar A. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35612-35620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Only recently, full-length structures of yeast Hsp90 and HtpG were reported. Yeast Hsp90 in complex with the co-chaperone p23 and AMP-PCP (44Ali M.M.U. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) indicated an N-terminally closed conformation as well as HtpG bound to AMP-PCP or ADP (26Shiau A.K. Harris S.F. Southworth D.R. Agard D.A. Cell. 2006; 127: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). HtpG in the apo-form but also Grp94 in the presence of nucleotide revealed an open conformation (26Shiau A.K. Harris S.F. Southworth D.R. Agard D.A.

The important function of the first amino acids of the N-terminal domains in establishing the N-terminal dimerization was analyzed using deletions or point mutations (43Richter K. Moser S. Hagn F.

As evidenced by this structural information, nucleotide binding leads to large scale conformational changes throughout the entire Hsp90 molecule. These nucleotide-dependent changes of Hsp90 seem to regulate the highly complex and dynamic interactions of Hsp90 with client proteins and co-chaperones. The crystal structures only describe snap shots but cannot provide information about the kinetics by which functional relevant states interchange nor their balance in solution.In this report, we investigated the ATPase cycle of Trap1 and determined all relevant equilibria as well as the dynamic properties of the individual steps of the ATPase cycle. We scrutinized the minimal kinetic model with global fit analysis and could not detect the necessity for additional steps prior or following hydrolysis nor could an even reduced model still explain all data. An extension of experimental conditions beyond those also used in other Hsp90 studies however indicated an additional, very fast step in ATP binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsAll chemicals (including nucleotides) were purchased from Sigma, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Gerbu Biotechnik (Gaiberg, Germany), Roche Applied Science, or Pharma Waldhof Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) at the highest quality available. RA was obtained from AG Scientific (San Diego, CA). (Pγ)-MABA-ATP was prepared as described previously (45Schlee, S., and Reinstein, J. (2004) in Protein Folding Handbook (Buchner, J., and Kiefhaber, T., eds) pp. 105-161, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co., Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar).Construction of the Plasmid peT-Trap1The cDNA sequence of humanTrap1, lacking the first 177 bp (Toft, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), was cloned as a restriction fragment into a peT9a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using Nde1 and BamH1 to express the protein in the cytoplasm of E. coli. The identity of the construct was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Its calculated molecular mass was 73,547 Da.Purification of Trap1E. coli BL21(DE) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were transformed with peT-Trap1. Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C, and protein synthesis was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 2 mm) at an optical density of 0.6. After induction, cells were grown at 37 °C for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and sonicated after addition of complete protease inhibiting mixture tablets for 20 min on ice. Finally, insoluble and soluble material was separated by centrifugation (186,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C, 45Ti rotor, Beckman, Krefeld, Germany). The protein was purified at 4 °C by ion exchange chromatography on an EMD-DEAE column (Merck) with a gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl in lysis buffer. After dialysis at 4 °C against 10 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, the pooled fractions were applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Merck) at 25 °C and eluted with a gradient from 0.01 to 0.5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. As a further purification step, size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, München, Germany) at 4 °C with 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. After analysis by SDS-PAGE, the gels were Coomassie-stained. The peak fractions containing protein with a molecular mass of 73 kDa were pooled and stored at a concentration of 12 mg/ml in the buffer of the gel filtration at -80 °C. The identity of Trap1 was determined by Western blotting using a polyclonal Trap1 antibody provided by D. Toft (Mayo Clinic) and mass spectrometry. The concentration of Trap1 was determined according to Ehresman (46Ehresmann B. Imbault P. Weil J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Multiangle Light ScatteringThe size of Trap1 was analyzed using an high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a size exclusion column (10 × 300 mm, Superdex 200, GE Healthcare, München, Germany) and a static light scatter instrument DAWN HELEOS (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). 150 μg of Trap1 in 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 were injected at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The scattered light was detected at 18 angles, and the data were analyzed using the software Astra 5.3.0.18. (Wyatt Technology).Analytical UltracentrifugationSedimentation velocity analysis was performed using a Beckman Coulter Proteome Lab XLI analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Krefeld, Germany) equipped with absorbance optics and interference detector using a Ti60 rotor. Three samples of Trap1 in 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol were run simultaneously at 20 °C and detected using absorbance at 280 nm (A280) (1-cm path length). The protein concentration was chosen so that the protein samples exhibited absorptions of 0.25, 0.58, and 0.8 A units. The buffer was used as a blank reference. Data were collected at A280 every minute. Data analysis was performed using SEDFIT Version 94 and SEDPHAT Version 5.01 (47Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). Beyond this analysis, we analyzed the data using the program Sedanal with an A2-to-2A-model, which provides further information about the dissociation constant of a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The value of 10 nm thus derived for the monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant represents a very rough approximation only (derived from extrapolations to lower protein concentrations). However, it is sufficient to conclude that Trap1 forms a fairly stable dimer. Values for the solvent density and protein partial specific volume were calculated using Sednterp to be 1.01755 g/ml and 0.74 ml/g, respectively.CD SpectroscopyCD spectra were recorded with a nitrogen-flushed JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany) equipped with a PTC343 peltier unit at 25 °C or between 25 and 80 °C. The Trap1 storage buffer was exchanged to 20 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 by a NAP column at 25 °C. CD signals of three spectra from 195 to 250 nm with 50-mdeg sensitivity at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with 0.5-nm resolution and 1 nm bandwidth were averaged. The time constant was 2 s. The protein concentration was 2 μm, and the cuvette path length was 0.1 cm. Spectra were measured corrected for buffer effects, and converted to mean residues ellipticity [θ]MRE according to a previous study (49Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The melting curve of Trap1 was measured in potassium phosphate buffer by increasing the temperature by 0.5 °C/min. The data analysis was performed using the Jasco32 software.Isothermal Titration CalorimetryTitration experiments were performed using a VP-ITC system (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). AMP-PCP and ADP were injected in 28 aliquots (6 × 5 μl, 19 × 10 μl, and 3 × 20 μl) of 400 μm into 1.424 ml of Trap1 (40 μm) at 25 °C. RA was injected in 28 aliquots of 10 μl of 200 μm into Trap1 at 15 μm. All solutions contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The resulting data were fit after subtracting the heats of dilution as described (50Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 51Ladbury J.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) using the program Origin and the add-on for ITC of version 5.5 (MicroCal Software Incorporation Northampton, USA). Heats of dilution were determined in separate experiments from addition of ligands into buffer. Titration data were fit using a nonlinear least-square curve-fitting algorithm with three floating variables: stoichiometry, binding constant (KB = 1/KD), and change of enthalpy of interaction (ΔH°). The data for AMP-PCP binding are close to the lower limits of detection of ITC and consequently have large relative errors.Fluorescence MeasurementsFluorescence measurements were performed with a Fluorolog fluorospectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). The excitation wavelength was 296 nm, and the emission wavelength was 350 nm. The temperature of the cuvette was 25 °C. 1 μm Trap1 in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 was investigated, and the spectra of three measurements were averaged.ATPase MeasurementCoupled Colorimetic Assay—ATPase assays were performed as described earlier using an ATP-regenerating system (52Adam, H. (1962) in Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse (Bergmeyer, H. K., ed) pp. 573-577, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar). All experiments were carried out in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C using 5 μm Trap1, if not indicated otherwise. Hydrolysis was monitored over 20 min or until the absorption of NADH dropped below 0.3. The Km value was determined using different ATP concentrations (between 0 and 200 μm). The assay was evaluated using GraFit Version 5.0.13 (Erithacus Software Limited, Horeley, UK). Inhibition of ATPase activity by RA was achieved by addition of 10 μm final concentration of the inhibitor.Single Turnover—The ATPase activity of Trap1 was investigated using 62 μm Trap1 and 52 μm ATP in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. For determination of the hydrolysis rate, the enzymatic hydrolysis of 16 μl of the nucleotide-protein-complex was stopped by denaturing with 4 μl 50% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 10 μl of the supernatant was neutralized by adding 20 μl of 2 m KOAc. The nucleotides were analyzed via a C18 reversed phase column (ODS Hypersil, 5 μm 250 × 4 mm, Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany) using a high-performance liquid chromatograph from Waters (Milford, MA), 50 mm KPi, pH 6.8, and a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. 10 μl of the neutralized mixture were applied, the nucleotides were detected at an absorption of 254 nm, and the area of the single peaks was integrated. An experiment under the same conditions with free nucleotide showed no spontaneous hydrolysis. After calibration with a nucleotide standard consisting of ATP, ADP, and AMP at 10 μm each, the amount and ratio of ATP to ADP was calculated.Transient KineticsStopped-flow measurements were performed with a HiTech SF-61 DX2 instrument in 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. The excitation slit was set to 0.5 nm, if not indicated otherwise. Nucleotide binding reactions were monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon excitation at 296 nm with a long pass filter (cutoff of 320 nm). In the case of the fluorescent ATP analog (Pγ)-MABA-ATP, binding reactions were followed either by fluorescent energy transfer between tryptophan and the bound (Pγ)-MABA-ATP upon excitation at 296 nm or by direct excitation of the fluorescent MABA group at 364 nm. In both cases the emission was detected using a cutoff filter of 420 nm.Each experiment was performed between three and eight times, and the resulting time traces were averaged with the software from HiTech Scientific. Concentrations are noted as conc1/conc2 (syringe/cell).The primary binding data of the stopped-flow measurements were analyzed with either a double-exponential equation for ATP (Equation 1), or a single-exponential equation (Equation 2), for ADP, AMP-PCP, and (Pγ)-MABA-ATP binding, displacement, and competition experiments. F=F0+A1(1−e−k1t)+A2(1−e−k2t)(Eq. 1) F=F0+A1(1−e−k1t)(Eq. 2) In Equations 1 and 2, F is signal, A is amplitude, F0 is offset, and k is observed rate constant. Most of the data indicated one additional minor phase. This additional phase was always independent of the nucleotide concentration and thus suggested photobleaching. This conclusion was confirmed by repeating the experiments with an auto-shutter, which abolished this phase. We therefore extended data analysis with either an additional linear or exponential term to allow for appropriate correction of the drift but omitted it in the discussion of data, because it is not relevant for any conclusions drawn.Considering the fact that the measurements of ADP, AMP-PCP, and (Pγ)-MABA-ATP with Trap1 were performed under pseudo first order conditions (one ligand in excess) and assuming a simple one-step binding mechanism, the data were analyzed by kobs = kon × Lexcess+ koff, with Lexcess being the concentration of ligand in excess and therefore a plot of kobs versus ligand concentration gives koff as the intercept and kon as the slope. The secondary data of ATP binding experiments, observed rate constants as obtained from a double exponential fit of each time trace versus concentration of ligand in excess, were then analyzed as described previously (53Bernasconi, C. F. (1976) Relaxation Kinetics, 1st Ed., pp. 20-29, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). For a two-step binding mechanism (see Fig. 7), the microscopic rate constants can be determined via k1 + k2 = k1,on × [ATP] + k1,off + k2,on + k2,off, where k is the observed rate constant, kon is the association rate constant, and koff is the dissociation rate constant. The product of the observed rate constants of the two phases versus concentration of ligand is also analyzed with a linear fit. The mechanism deduces that k1 × k2 = k1,on × (k2,on + k2,off) × [ATP] + k1,off × k2,off. The four rate constants are then determined as follows, k1,on=slope(1)(Eq. 3) k1,off=int(1)−slope(2)slope(1)(Eq. 4) k2,off=int(2)k1,off(Eq. 5) k2,on=int(1)−k1,off+k2,off(Eq. 6) where int(1) and int(2) are the intercepts of the k1 + k2 and k1 × k2 replots, and slope(1) and slope(2) are the corresponding slopes.The rate constants for binding and release of unlabeled nucleotides were also determined by displacement measurement where ATP was added in various concentrations to a preformed complex of (Pγ)-MABA-ATP with Trap1. Applying koff and kon known from pseudo-first order experiments as described above the values for unlabeled ATP were determined using the following adapt"

https://openalex.org/W2031907684,"Tumor neo-vascularization is critical for tumor growth, invasion and metastasis, which has been considered to be mediated by a mechanism of angiogenesis. However, histopathological studies have suggested that tumor cells might be the progenitor for tumor vasculature. Recently, we have reported that the precancerous stem cells (pCSCs) representing the early stage of developing cancer stem cells (CSCs), have the potential for both benign and malignant differentiation. Therefore, we investigated whether pCSCs serve as progenitors for tumor vasculogenesis. Herein, we report that in the pCSC-derived tumors, most blood vessels were derived from pCSCs. Some pCSCs constitutively expressed vasculogenic receptor VEGFR-2, which can be up-regulated by hypoxia and angiogenesis-promoting cytokines, such as GM-CSF, Flt3 ligand, and IL-13. The pCSCs are much more potent in tumor vasculogenesis than the differentiated tumor monocytic cells (TMCs) from the same tumor, which had comparable or even higher capacity to produce some vascular growth factors, suggesting that the potent tumor vasculogenesis of pCSCs is associated with their intrinsic stem-like property. Consistently tumor vasculogenesis was also observed in human cancers such as cervical cancer and breast cancer and xenograft lymphoma. Our studies indicate that pCSCs can serve as tumor vasculogenic stem/progenitor cells (TVPCs), and may explain why anti-angiogenic cancer therapy trials are facing challenge."

In humans MC1R has been found to be highly polymorphic with several functional variants associated with the phenotype of red hair color and fair skin, cutaneous UV sensitivity, and increased risk of developing melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Recent evidence suggests that MC1R plays a photo-protective role in melanocytes in response to UV irradiation. Relatively few genetic targets of MC1R signaling have been identified independent of the pigmentation pathway. Here we show that MC1R signaling in B16 mouse melanoma cells and primary human melanocytes rapidly, and transiently, induces the transcription of the NR4A subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors. Furthermore, primary human melanocytes harboring homozygous RHC variant MC1R alleles exhibited an impaired induction of NR4A genes in response to the potent MC1R agonist (Nle4,D-Phe7)-α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Using small interference RNA-mediated attenuation of NR4A1 and NR4A2 expression in melanocytes, the ability to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers following UV irradiation appeared to be impaired in the context of MC1R signaling.

MC1R is a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor that has been found to be highly polymorphic in Caucasian individuals, with a number of functional variants strongly associating with a phenotype of red hair, fair skin, and poor tanning ability often referred to as the Red Hair Color (RHC) phenotype (7Sturm R.A. Melanoma Res. 2002; 12: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). MC1R preferentially binds the pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone, which leads to an elevation in intracellular cAMP levels (10Busca R. Ballotti R. Pigm. Cell Res. 2000; 13: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). RHC variant MC1Rs have been demonstrated to elicit weak cAMP responses as a result of reduced receptor coupling (2Sturm R.A. Duffy D.L. Box N.F. Newton R.A. Shepherd A.G. Chen W. Marks L.H.

Molecular analysis has revealed that MC1R signaling modulates the expression and function of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, a key regulator of pigmentation genes, suggesting that this pathway underlies MC1R coordination of melanogenesis (16Levy C.

Accumulating evidence suggests the photo-protective effect of MC1R signaling goes beyond quantitative and qualitative changes in melanin synthesis and extends to protection against UV-induced genomic damage via the induction of nucleotide excision repair mechanisms (17Bohm M.

Although variant MC1R is anticipated to have a significant effect on melanocyte gene expression, few downstream transcriptional targets of MC1R signaling have been identified to date (20April C.S.

Physiol. 2008; 215: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the differential transcriptional response between wild-type and RHC signaling remains poorly understood. The NR4A genes are a subfamily of nuclear receptors that includes NR4A1 (Nur77), NR4A2 (Nurr1), and NR4A3 (NOR-1) in mammals. The nuclear receptor superfamily of transcriptional regulators includes the classical steroid receptors, the thyroid and retinoid receptors, and a large subgroup of receptors referred to as “orphan receptors” as no natural or synthetic hormone/ligands have been identified to date (23Smith A.G. Muscat G.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 2047-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Smith A.G. Muscat G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C203-C217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The NR4A subfamily belongs to the orphan receptor subgroup, and crystal structure analysis suggests these receptors may be true orphan receptors that are unable to accommodate molecules within their ligand binding domain in the same manner as traditional NR ligand binding domains (25Maxwell M.A. Muscat G.E. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Martinez-Gonzalez J. Badimon L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The NR4A subfamily was first identified as early response genes for growth factors (27Law S.W. Conneely O.M. DeMayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). All three NR4A receptors bind to DNA consensus elements termed NBREs as monomers or to a palindromic NurRE sequence as homo- or heterodimers (29Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). NR4A genes have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling and in pathologies such as neurological disorders including Parkinson disease, schizophrenia and manic depression, inflammatory and cardiovascular disease, and cancer (25Maxwell M.A. Muscat G.E. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hsu H.C. Zhou T. Mountz J.D. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2004; 3: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression and function of the NR4A family of nuclear receptors are influenced by a wide range of signaling pathways that utilize a number of signaling cascades to generate a functional output, including cAMP, MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38/MAPK, protein kinase C, and Ca2+ (25Maxwell M.A. Muscat G.E.

Interestingly, reports demonstrating the activation of NR4A proteins by the purine anti-metabolite 6-mercaptopurine and related compounds suggest that this gene family may be involved in the genotoxic stress response (35Wansa K.D.

The induced expression of NR4A1 has been reported previously in melanoma cells in response to interleukin-1β signaling (37Rangnekar V.V. Waheed S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has recently been linked to melanoma apoptotic sensitivity (38Yu H. Kumar S.M. Fang D. Acs G. Xu X. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The expression and function of the NR4A2 and NR4A3 genes in melanocytic cells have not been reported to date. Here we report that all three NR4A receptors are induced and function immediately downstream of MC1R signaling in melanocytic cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impaired induction of the NR4A gene family in primary human melanocytes of MC1R variant genotype. This observation reveals the NR4A gene family as one of the immediate transcriptional targets of MC1R signaling in melanocytic cells. Moreover, the functional role of this nuclear receptor subfamily in melanocyte gene expression remains to be explored. Cell Culture, UV Irradiation, and Transfection Analysis—B16 melanoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin (20 units/ml)/streptomycin (20 g/ml). Transfections using the pGL2B-NurRE luciferase reporter (39Maira M. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol.

Cells were harvested and analyzed as described previously (31Maxwell M.A. Cleasby M.E. Harding A. Stark A. Cooney G.J. Muscat G.E. J. Biol.

Primary human melanocytes (QF278, 840, 731, 863, 955, and 1093) were cultured using established protocols (41Newton R.A. Roberts D.W. Leonard J.H. Sturm R.A. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2387-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Primary human melanocytes derived from differentiated melanoblasts (QF1170 and 1160) were cultured and differentiated as described previously (42Cook A.L. Donatien P.D. Smith A.G. Murphy M.

Differentiating melanocytes were grown on coverslips for 3 days prior to UV irradiation experiments, and cells were transfected with siRNA reagents 24 h prior to UV irradiation. siRNA reagents were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendation to a final concentration of 50 nm. siRNA reagents were: negative control (Ambion), NR4A1 (1:1 pooled ID41824 and ID41752; Ambion), and NR4A2 (Smartpool; Dharmacon). Following a 4-h preincubation in medium supplemented with either vehicle or NDP-MSH (10 nm), cells were irradiated with 25 mJ cm-2 UVB in phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (41Newton R.A. Roberts D.W. Leonard J.H. Sturm R.A. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2387-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Following irradiation, cells were maintained in vehicle or NDP-MSH-containing medium for a further 24 h, at which point cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by immunofluorescence. RNA Analysis and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from melanoma cell lines using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by DNase treatment and further purification using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) described previously (31Maxwell M.A. Cleasby M.E.

Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a random hexamer and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target cDNA levels were analyzed by q-RT-PCR using SYBR Green or TaqMan reagent (ABI) as described previously (31Maxwell M.A. Cleasby M.E. Harding A. Stark A. Cooney G.J. Muscat G.E. J. Biol.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared using B16 cells as described previously (43Smith A.G. Brightwell G. Smit S.E. Parsons P.G. Sturm R.A. Melanoma Res. 1998; 8: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed using radiolabeled annealed oligonucleotides containing the NBRE consensus element (44Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequences were 5′-gggatcctcgtgcgaaaaggtcaagcgcta-3′ (upper strand), 5′-ggttcctggcatttgaggtaaatatcacta-3′ (lower strand). UV Irradiation of Cultured Cells and Immunofluorescence—Primary human melanoblasts were cultured on coverslips and differentiated into melanocytes and manipulated as described above. Immunofluorescence was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed cells to determine nuclear CDP content using an anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer antibody (TDM-2; MBL International Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For quantification six to eight representative pictures per coverslip were taken and analyzed in Adobe Photoshop for fluorescence intensity (grey scale). Images were obtained on an Olympus BX-51 epifluorescence microscope with a DP-70 camera. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed on a minimum of three independent experiments using a ratio t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's post-test using GraphPad-PRISM software. Induction of NR4A Gene Expression by MC1R Signaling in B16 Melanoma—We first analyzed the NR4A class of nuclear receptors as potential target genes of MC1R signaling using B16 mouse melanoma cells. B16 cells were chosen as they express wild-type MC1R with an intact downstream signaling pathway (45Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 623-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wong W. Minchin R.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As NR4A genes are known to be serum-responsive (25Maxwell M.A. Muscat G.E. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Martinez-Gonzalez J. Badimon L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), B16 cells were preincubated for 2 h in serum-free medium, at which point cells were treated with vehicle or 10 nm NDP-MSH and RNA harvested at the indicated time points over 36 h. Time point RNA samples were analyzed by real-time PCR for expression of each NR4A family member. This analysis revealed that the mRNAs encoding the NR4A1-3 genes were rapidly and transiently induced following NDP-MSH treatment in B16 melanoma cells (Fig. 1). More specifically, NR4A1 and NR4A2 showed maximal induction at 1 h, while maximal induction of NR4A3 occurred at 2 h post NDP-MSH treatment. Analysis of NR4A function in B16 cells in response to MC1R signaling was performed using a transiently transfected NR4A reporter construct containing the NurRE consensus element upstream of the luciferase gene (39Maira M. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Increased luciferase activity was detected in B16 cells treated with NDP-MSH compared with control cells, with maximal activity detected after 6 h in experiments performed here (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, luciferase activity was returning to basal levels 24 h post NDP-MSH stimulation, suggesting the NR4A proteins are functioning within the first 24 h after MC1R activation. Direct detection of NR4A DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts generated from B16 cells 8 h after vehicle, NDP-MSH, or forskolin treatment was performed by EMSA. Comparison of DNA-protein complexes bound to an NBRE consensus element (44Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) in these studies demonstrated an increased binding activity in both NDP-MSH- and forskolin-treated cells when compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 2B). These data confirm increased NR4A mRNA and protein expression and functional activity in B16 cells occurs immediately downstream of MC1R signaling. Cross-talk between the NR4A Nuclear Receptor and MC1R Signaling Cascades in B16 Melanoma Cells—Although MC1R signaling functions primarily via the stimulation of adenylate cyclase resulting in the production of cAMP, emerging evidence suggests that a number of other signaling cascades are also activated by MC1R in melanocytic cells (10Busca R. Ballotti R. Pigm. Cell Res. 2000; 13: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 41Newton R.A. Roberts D.W. Leonard J.H. Sturm R.A.

Moreover, the NR4A subgroup has been shown to be targets of cAMP signaling in a number of cell types (25Maxwell M.A. Muscat G.E. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Martinez-Gonzalez J. Badimon L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling cascades involved in MC1R-mediated induction of NR4A genes, we stimulated B16 melanoma cells with vehicle or NDP-MSH in the presence of a number of specific signaling protein inhibitors, including H89 (protein kinase A), GF10933X (protein kinase C), SB203580 (p38/MAPK), and PD98059 (MEK1/2). As shown in Fig. 3, NDP-MSH-mediated induction of all three NR4A genes was observed in the presence of the vehicle control (DMSO) while attenuation of this response was observed to varying degrees with the inhibitor compounds, suggesting multiple signaling cascades are activated by MC1R (Fig. 3). Effect of RHC Variants on MC1R-mediated Induction of NR4A Genes—Given the importance of the MC1R signaling pathway in human pigmentation and UV protection, we determined whether the NR4A genes are similarly induced by NDP-MSH in human melanocytes. To this end, primary human melanocytes of defined MC1R genotypes were treated with NDP-MSH or vehicle and analyzed for NR4A induction at 1- and 3-h time points following administration. Previous reports have demonstrated the ability of wild-type consensus MC1R alleles to stimulate the cAMP pathway in response to NDP-MSH, an effect that is significantly attenuated in the context of homozygous RHC variant alleles (9Kadekaro A.L. Kanto H. Kavanagh R. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 994: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Newton R.A. Smit S.E. Barnes C.C. Pedley J. Parsons P.G. Sturm R.A.

Abdel-Malek Z.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2349-2355PubMed Google Scholar). Three melanocyte strains homozygous for the wild-type MC1R exhibited a marked induction of the NR4A2 gene in response to NDP-MSH above basal levels (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the levels of NR4A2 expression in homozygous RHC variant MC1R strains were significantly impaired (Fig. 4B). A comparison of pooled expression data in these melanocyte strains revealed the differential induction of NR4A2 expression between the wild-type- and RHC-expressing melanocytes in response to NDP-MSH was statistically significant (Fig. 4E). Induction of the NR4A1 and NR4A3 subtypes in response to NDP-MSH stimulation was also apparent in wild-type MC1R-expressing melanocytes, whereas the levels of induced NR4A1 or NR4A3 expression were lower in the context of RHC variant MC1R (Fig. 4, A and C). Comparison between pooled WT and RHC expression data for the NR4A1 and NR4A3 genes revealed a similar trend in which induction of these family members was reduced in RHC variant melanocytes relative to the induction levels observed in the context of WT MC1R (Fig. 4, D and F). In all melanocyte strains used in this study NR4A gene expression returned to basal levels 3 h post NDP-MSH stimulation (data not shown). NR4A Role in MC1R-mediated DNA Repair in Melanocytes—Recent evidence has shown that MC1R function protects against DNA damage independently of pigmentation pheno-type. Given the immediacy of NR4A induction by MC1R signaling, we decided to investigate the effect of attenuated NR4A1/2 expression on the photo-protective activity of MC1R. Cyclobutane pyrimidine (CPD) dimers are a hallmark DNA lesion induced by ultraviolet radiation. Previous investigations have revealed that MC1R signaling in melanocytes facilitates the clearance of UVB-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, pointing to an important role for MC1R in protection against UV-induced mutations that may lead to malignancy (17Bohm M.

Accordingly, we chose to examine the effect of loss of NR4A gene expression on the ability of MC1R signaling to promote repair of CPD lesions. First we demonstrated that NR4A1/2 expression induced by MC1R signaling could be attenuated in primary human melanocytes using NR4A1/NR4A2-specific siRNAs. Although transfection with a negative siRNA did not prevent MC1R-mediated induction of NR4A1 and NR4A2 mRNA, the specific siRNAs effectively attenuated induction of these genes as assessed by real-time PCR (Fig. 5, A and B). Dual NR4A1 and NR4A2 knock down was employed in these studies to avoid potential redundancy between these closely related receptors. The ability of melanocytes treated in this manner to remove UVB-induced CPDs in the presence or absence of NDP-MSH was subsequently investigated. Primary human melanocytes were transfected with either negative or pooled NR4A1/2 siRNAs 24 h prior to UVB irradiation. Following a 4-h preincubation with medium containing either vehicle or NDP-MSH, the melanocytes were irradiated with 25 mJ cm-2, after which they were maintained in vehicle- or NDP-MSH-containing medium for a further 24 h. Visualization of nuclear CPD content in these experiments by immunofluorescence revealed that NDP-MSH-treated cells exhibited less fluorescence than vehicle-treated cells in the presence of a negative siRNA, indicating the clearance of UVB-induced CPD lesions by MC1R signaling (Fig. 5C, upper panels). Notably, in cells transfected with the combination of NR4A1 and NR4A2 siRNAs there appeared to be little difference in CPD content between vehicle and NDP-MSH-treated melanocytes (Fig. 5C, lower panels). Quantification of the fluorescence intensity of these cells from three independent experiments confirmed the attenuated clearance of CPDs by NDP-MSH in cells in which NR4A1/2 expression had been inhibited (Fig. 5D). Specifically, there were significantly lower levels of CPDs detected in negative siRNA-transfected melanocytes following treatment with NDP-MSH compared with vehicle, whereas there was little difference between the levels of CPDs contained in melanocytes in which NR4A1/2 had been knocked down. Moreover, there was as significant difference in the relative CPD content between negative siRNA- and NR4A1/2 siRNA-treated melanocytes in the presence of NDP-MSH. These data confirm the ability of MC1R signaling to mediate the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions as reported previously (17Bohm M. Wolff I. Scholzen T.E. Robinson S.J. Healy E. Luger T.A. Schwarz T.

The activation of signaling pathways through α-MSH ligand stimulation has long been known to be a key regulator of constitutive and UV-induced pigmentation in humans. The identification of MC1R as the primary target of the α-MSH peptide in melanocytes in the last decade, coupled with genetic association studies, has highlighted the importance of this pathway to mammalian pigmentation (7Sturm R.A. Melanoma Res. 2002; 12: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Rouzaud F. Kadekaro A.L. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Hearing V.J. Mutat.

Despite considerable efforts, the physiological function of MC1R in coordinating melanocyte pigmentation and photo-protection remains poorly understood. The identification of downstream targets and effectors of MC1R represents an important step in advancing our understanding of this pathway. Initial studies reported here reveal the rapid and transient induction of the NR4A family of orphan nuclear receptors following stimulation of B16 mouse melanoma cells with the potent MC1R agonist NDP-MSH. The induction profile of all three members of this receptor family is similar to that observed in other systems, with maximal mRNA expression detected at 1 h for both NR4A1 and NR4A2 receptors, after which expression levels rapidly return to basal levels. Expression of the NR4A3 receptor is similarly induced following NDP-MSH treatment; however, maximal induction is achieved 2 h after MC1R stimulation and returns to basal levels after 4 h. The rapid and transient induction profile observed for these receptors suggests that they are involved in coordinating the immediate transcriptional response of the MC1R signaling pathway. Furthermore, increased NR4A DNA binding activity detected by EMSA coupled with NR4A-responsive reporter assays suggests the NR4A genes are transcriptionally active within the first 24 h post MC1R receptor stimulation. We analyzed the effect of specific signaling pathway inhibitors on MC1R-mediated NR4A gene induction in order to identify signaling cascades involved in MC1R signaling via the NR4A receptor family. While inhibition of the cAMP pathway was anticipated to attenuate NR4A induction by MC1R signaling, the ability of the protein kinase C and p38 pathway inhibitors to attenuate NR4A induction by MC1R activation suggests cross-talk between these cascades and MC1R signaling. Similar evidence for multiple signaling pathway involvement in NR4A gene induction has been observed in the context of corticotroph stimulation by corticotrophin-releasing hormone/cAMP (51Kovalovsky D. Refojo D. Liberman A.C. Hochbaum D. Pereda M.P. Coso O.A. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports have demonstrated cross-talk between MC1R-mediated cAMP and p38/MAPK signaling pathways (41Newton R.A. Roberts D.W. Leonard J.H. Sturm R.A. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2387-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have revealed a significant association between variant MC1R and cutaneous malignant melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, leading to the conclusion that MC1R is a skin cancer susceptibility gene (3Sturm R.A.

In light of the links between variant and aberrant MC1R signaling and skin cancer predisposition, it was important to ascertain the effect of functional variant alleles of MC1R on induction of NR4A. The identification of divergent melanocyte function in the context of WT or variant MC1R proteins will provide vital clues into the mechanisms underlying the association between MC1R status and pigmentation phenotype, UV sensitivity, and melanoma/skin cancer susceptibility. The data presented here reveal that the induction of NR4A gene expression is one of the immediate steps in MC1R signaling in melanocytes expressing wild-type alleles of MC1R. Moreover, in melanocyte strains derived from individuals that are homozygous for the three most common RHC variant MC1R alleles, R151C, R160W, and D294H, the induction of NR4A expression in response to ligand stimulation is compromised. It is possible that the impaired NR4A induction by variant MC1R may underlie to some extent the susceptibility of RHC individuals to skin cancer. Although much of the cutaneous photo-protective function of the wild-type MC1R protein is undoubtedly attributable to its role in basal and inducible melanization, recent reports suggest a protective role for MC1R against UV-induced DNA damage independent of pigmentation. Human melanocytes carrying common RHC variants were found to have impaired clearance of UV-induced CPD lesions, an effect that was independent of the melanin content of the cells (18Hauser J.E. Kadekaro A.L. Kavanagh R.J. Wakamatsu K. Terzieva S. Schwemberger S. Babcock G. Rao M.B. Ito S. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Pigm. Cell Res. 2006; 19: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This observation, coupled with previous reports demonstrating the reduction of UV-induced CPD lesions by MC1R signaling (17Bohm M. Wolff I. Scholzen T.E. Robinson S.J. Healy E. Luger T.A. Schwarz T.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4292-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), suggests that enhancing DNA repair is a vital mechanism by which the MC1R pathway protects melanocytes from UV-induced mutations. Moreover, MC1R-mediated DNA repair in response to UV irradiation is an early event and precedes other MC1R-controlled processes such as melanization. In light of the fact that NR4A induction by MC1R was an immediate event following receptor stimulation, and functional studies suggested these nuclear receptors were transcriptionally active during the following 24 h, we chose to examine the effect of loss of NR4A expression on DNA repair in the context of MC1R signaling. Melanocytes transfected with a negative control siRNA prior to UVB irradiation exhibited an enhanced rate of DNA repair in response to NDP-MSH stimulation in concordance with previous reports demonstrating MC1R-mediated DNA repair (17Bohm M.

Importantly, siRNA knock down of NR4A1 and NR4A2 expression in melanocytes attenuated the ability of MC1R signaling to repair UVB-induced CPD lesions. These data suggest a novel functional link between MC1R-driven DNA repair and the NR4A nuclear receptor signaling pathway. This contention is further supported by reports suggesting NR4A genes function as sensors of genotoxic stress (35Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Yan G. Ordentlich P. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24776-24790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In these reports NR4A proteins were found to be responsive to the purine anti-metabolite 6-mercaptopurine and its derivatives. The induction of genotoxic stress is a key component of the anti-proliferative activity of this class of compound, leading to the suggestion that the NR4A subgroup mediates the cellular response to genotoxic stress via the activation of an NR4A transcriptional response (35Wansa K.D.

https://openalex.org/W1970543194,"The interaction of measles virus with its receptor signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) controls cell entry and governs tropism. We predicted potential interface areas of the measles virus attachment protein hemagglutinin to begin the investigation. We then assessed the relevance of individual amino acids located in these areas for SLAM-binding and SLAM-dependent membrane fusion, as measured by surface plasmon resonance and receptor-specific fusion assays, respectively. These studies identified one hemagglutinin protein residue, isoleucine 194, which is essential for primary binding. The crystal structure of the hemagglutinin-protein localizes Ile-194 at the interface of propeller blades 5 and 6, and our data indicate that a small aliphatic side chain of residue 194 stabilizes a protein conformation conducive to binding. In contrast, a quartet of residues previously shown to sustain SLAM-dependent fusion is not involved in binding. Instead, our data prove that after binding, this quartet of residues on propeller blade 5 conducts conformational changes that are receptor-specific. Our study sets a structure-based stage for understanding how the SLAM-elicited conformational changes travel through the H-protein ectodomain before triggering fusion protein unfolding and membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2046085608,"DNA sequences rich in runs of guanine have the potential to form G4 DNA, a four-stranded non-canonical DNA structure stabilized by formation and stacking of G quartets, planar arrays of four hydrogen-bonded guanines. It was reported recently that G4 DNA can be generated in Escherichia coli during transcription of plasmids containing G-rich sequences in the non-transcribed strand. In addition, a stable RNA/DNA hybrid is formed with the transcribed strand. These novel structures, termed G loops, are suppressed in recQ(+) strains, suggesting that their persistence may generate genomic instability and that the RecQ helicase may be involved in their dissolution. However, little is known about how such non-canonical DNA structures are processed when encountered by an elongating polymerase. To assess whether G4-forming sequences interfere with transcription, we studied their effect on transcription elongation by T7 RNA polymerase and mammalian RNA polymerase II. We used a reconstituted transcription system in vitro with purified polymerase and initiation factors and with substrates containing G-rich sequences in either the transcribed or non-transcribed strand downstream of the T7 promoter or the adenovirus major late promoter. We report that G-rich sequences located in the transcribed strand do not affect transcription by either polymerase, but when the sequences are located in the non-transcribed strand, they partially arrest both polymerases. The efficiency of arrest increases with negative supercoiling and also with multiple rounds of transcription compared with single events."

Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2310-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we found that human S100A8 (has 58% structural identity with murine S100A8) had little monocyte chemotactic activity, and the hinge domain (hS100A843–56) was inactive (21Lackmann M. Rajasekariah P. Iismaa S.E. Jones G. Cornish C.J. Hu S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2981-2991PubMed Google Scholar). Our structural modeling studies (7Ravasi T. Hsu K.

Genomics. 2004; 84: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) predict that the chemotactic human homologue of the active hinge domain of murine S100A8 (mS100A842–55) may be S100A12 (S100A1238–53). Here we show that S100A12 promotes migration of MC in vitro and in vivo and that S100A1238–53, a region containing the hinge domain, was chemotactic for murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), rat peritoneal mast cells (PMC), and human monocytes in vitro. Like S100A12, S100A1238–53 provoked mild mast cell degranulation in vitro and leukocyte recruitment in vitro and in vivo and induced a Ca2+ influx in mouse BMMC. Amino acid residues important for activity were identified; those essential for MC activating activity and edema were hydrophobic (Leu40, Ile44, Ile47, and Ile53). Dose response curves indicated a single receptor on MC and high and low affinity receptors on THP-1 monocytoid cells that were inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting involvement of G-protein-coupled receptors in signal transduction. Results strengthen our proposal for a role for S100A12 in allergic inflammation and may lead to rational design of S100A12 antagonists. Human Subjects and Animals—Peripheral blood from normal donors was obtained with approval of the Human Care and Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales with written informed consent. All animals were specific pathogen-free; BALB/c mice were used as a source of BMMC; Quackenbush Swiss mice were used to study responses to S100A12 in vivo, and Sprague-Dawley rats (10 weeks old) were the source of PMC. Experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales. Protein and Peptides—Recombinant human S100A12 was expressed and purified as described (2Yang Z. Tao T. Raftery M.J. Youssef P. Di Girolamo N. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar). Chain assembly of S100A1238–53 (KELANTIKNIKDKAVI) and its alanine scan mutants (24Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) was performed manually as described (25Meyers H.V. Dilley G.J. Durgin T.L. Powers T.S. Winssinger N.A. Zhu H. Pavia M.R. Mol. Divers. 1995; 1: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Endotoxin levels in all preparations were <10 pg/10 μg using the chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Cape Cod Associates, Woods Hole, MA). Electrospray-Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry was performed on an LCT time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MicroMass, Manchester, UK). Samples were injected into a moving solvent (100 μl/min; 70% aqueous acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) and entered the analyzer through an interface plate. Full scan mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 500–2000 Da. Molecular masses were calculated from the observed m/z value using Mass Lynx software (MicroMass). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-730 spectropolarimeter. Samples (59 μm) were dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and data between 190 and 260 nm were recorded. Cells—The monocytoid cell line (THP-1; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heated (56 °C, 30 min) bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Media was sterilized by filtration through Zetapore 0.2-μm membrane (Cuno, Meriden, CT) to remove contaminating traces of endotoxin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from buffy coats of citrated blood of normal donors were isolated using Ficoll-Paque™ Plus, (Amersham Biosciences), washed 3 times with Ca2+, Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), and resuspended in 0.2% bovine calf serum/RPMI. BMMC were differentiated from murine bone marrow stem cells cultured in conditioned media consisting of supernatants from WEHI-3B (source of interleukin-3) and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (source of stem cell factor) and 10% bovine calf serum in RPMI 1640 as described (26Wang H.W. Tedla N. Lloyd A.R. Wakefield D. McNeil P.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged weekly and differentiated until >98% MC (∼3 weeks), assessed by metachromatic staining of granules with toluidine blue (TB). PMC harvested from rats by peritoneal lavage were isolated as described (27He D. Esquenazi-Behar S. Soter N.A. Lim H.W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purity by TB staining was ∼99% MC, and viability was >98%. Cells were suspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma)/RPMI. Chemotaxis and Inhibition Studies—Chemotaxis of calcein (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR)-loaded cells was performed as described (2Yang Z. Tao T. Raftery M.J. Youssef P. Di Girolamo N. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar) using 96-well chambers separated by a polycarbonate membrane (NeuroProbe Inc., Bethesda, MD) with pores of 5 μm for peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 8 μm for BMMC, and 10 μm for THP-1, with six replicates per sample. C5a (Sigma; 10–8 m) was employed as a positive control. Chambers were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air for 1.5 h (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), 2 h (THP-1), or 4 h (BMMC). To determine involvement of RAGE, soluble RAGE peptide (sRAGE42–59) or the control peptide with the reverse sequence (rvRAGE) was preincubated with S100A12 at 10:1 molar excess overnight at 4 °C before migration assay. Alternatively, because RAGE signaling involves downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase activation via extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), THP-1 cells were incubated with PD98059 (Calbiochem; 10 μm) for 2 h before assay. To determine involvement of G-protein-coupled receptors, THP-1 cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin (Sigma, 0.1 μg/ml) for 2 h before testing. Results are expressed as numbers of migrated cells as described (2Yang Z. Tao T. Raftery M.J. Youssef P. Di Girolamo N. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar) or as migration index for pertussis toxin and PD98059-treated cells. F-actin Polymerization and Cytosolic Ca2+ Flux—Cells (0.5 × 106/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution and 0.2% bovine serum albumin were prewarmed at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before the addition of S100A12 or S100A1238–53 diluted in the same buffer at 37 °C (2Yang Z. Tao T. Raftery M.J. Youssef P. Di Girolamo N. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (2.5 × 104) in 96-well plates cells were mixed with 50 μl of stimulants to yield final concentrations between 10–9 and 10–12 m. Cells were permeabilized and stained for F-actin for 60 min with a mixture of 0.05% (w/v) digitonin (Calbiochem) and 0.5 μm fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma). fMLP (10–9 m) was used as positive control. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fluorescent probe Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes) (2Yang Z. Tao T. Raftery M.J. Youssef P. Di Girolamo N. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission was assayed immediately and for 10–20 cycles (3 s/cycle) at λex = 480 nm and λem = 530 nm. C5a (10–7 m) was used as positive control. Mediator Production—MC degranulation was assessed by measuring β-hexosaminidase (β-hex) or histamine release. Supernatants and cell pellets (lysed with 100 μl 1% Triton X-100) from stimulated BMMC or PMC were assayed for β-hex as described; (28Murakami M. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) histamine was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Hamburg, Germany). Data are expressed as percentage (%) release calculated as (β-hex or histamine in supernatant/β-hex or histamine in supernatant + lysate) × 100. In Vivo Studies—To assess inflammatory responses in vivo, mice were injected with 10 μg of S100A12 or S100A1238–53 in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution intraperitoneally. Peritoneal cavities were lavaged (5 × 5 ml of citrated Hanks' balanced salt solution). 8 and 24 h later cells were harvested by centrifugation, and total MC numbers were determined using cytospin preparations after TB staining. Alternatively, S100A12, S100A1238–53, or mutant peptides (2 μg/30 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution/site) were injected into the footpad. Footpad thickness was measured with an electronic caliper (Mitutoyo, Japan) before and 20 and 30 min and 1 and 2 h after injections by two blinded investigators. Edema was defined as positive if the difference in footpad thickness 60 min post-injection was 0.1 mm greater than the pre-injection reading. To determine changes in vascular permeability, Evan's blue (1% in saline; 0.05 ml/mouse) was injected intravenously 30 min before footpad injection. The assessment was expressed as a clinical score: 0, no blue, no edema; 1, edema, no blue; 2, edema, light blue; 3, edema, blue; 4, edema, dark blue. For some samples footpads were harvested 2 and 8 h post-injection, and leukocyte infiltration was assessed on formalin-fixed sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin or TB to detect MC. Macrophages were identified with anti-Mac-3 mAb (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), and reactivity was detected with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAKO, Denmark). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Data from two groups were assessed using the Student's t test and multiple groups by analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramar or Bonferroni test, and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Human A12 Is a Mast Cell Chemoattractant in Vitro and in Vivo—Because S100A12 activates MC, and as MC numbers increase in asthmatic tissue, their chemotactic response was tested. S100A12 stimulated BMMC migration in a dose-dependent manner that was optimal at 10–11 m (Fig. 1; 2.74 ± 0.19 × 104 cells migrated compared with control, 2.02 ± 0.17 × 104 cells, p < 0.05). Directional, rather than random migration, was confirmed when the gradient was negated by equivalent amounts of S100A12 in the upper and lower chambers (Fig. 1; p < 0.01 relative to maximal chemotaxis at 10–11 m S100A12in the lower chamber only). Human cord blood MC migration was also significantly greater than control values with 10–9–10–10 m S100A12 (p = 0.02 compared with control; not shown). Responses of both types of MC to S100A12 were equivalent or greater than those provoked by a pre-optimized concentration of C5a. Because BMMC are responsive to S100A12 (Ref. 4Yang Z. Yan W.X. Cai H. Tedla N. Armishaw C. Di Girolamo N. Wang H.W. Hampartzoumian T. Simpson J.L. Gibson P.G. Hunt J. Hart P. Hughes J.M. Perry M.A. Alewood P.F. Geczy C.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2007; 119: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), these were routinely used as they are more rapidly differentiated in vitro at significantly less cost. Chemotactic Activity of S100A1238–53—To determine whether the hinge domain of S100A12 could provoke a chemotactic response, migration of THP-1 monocytoid cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (S100A12 is only chemotactic for monocytes) (2Yang Z. Tao T. Raftery M.J. Youssef P. Di Girolamo N. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse BMMC were tested. S100A12 consistently provoked THP-1 cell migration (Fig. 2A) in a biphasic manner with two prominent peaks at 10–9 and 10–12 m (both p < 0.001 compared with negative control). S100A1238–53 was also chemotactic at these concentrations (p < 0.05 compared with negative control), although the peptide was significantly less potent than the full-length protein. When equivalent levels of S100A1238–53 were included in the upper and lower chambers, basal migration did not significantly increase (Fig. 2A), confirming directional migration. Similar dose response optima were obtained for migration of blood monocytes in response to S100A12, although the peptide was not active at 10–9 m (Fig. 2B). Chemoattractants cause polymerization of actin, a major component of microfilaments important for cell migration. S100A12 (10–11 m) increased F-actin content in THP-1 cells within 20 s, which plateaued then increased and was sustained over 2 min. fMLP caused similar increases but was less sustained. S100A1238–53 provoked a somewhat slower response with a second more intense rise in F-actin content apparent after 60 s, which returned to base line within 120 s (Fig. 2C). sRAGE, a RAGE antagonist, reduced migration of THP-1 cells in response to 10–9 m S100A12 (p < 0.01), whereas migration at 10–12 m S100A12 was unaffected; the control, RvRAGE peptide, did affect migration to S100A12 at either concentration (Fig. 3A). ERK1/2 may play a role in RAGE signaling through direct interaction with RAGE (29Ishihara K. Tsutsumi K. Kawane S. Nakajima M. Kasaoka T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); however, PD98059, a selective ERK1/2 inhibitor, did not affect S100A12-provoked THP-1 cell migration at either concentration or affect migration to C5a (Fig. 3B). In contrast, S100A12 induced THP-1 migration at both concentrations, and C5a were significantly reduced by pertussis toxin (p < 0.05; Fig. 3C). S100A1238–53-induced migration of BMMC was optimal at 10–11 m (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). Maximal responses of native or hinge S100A12 preparations were consistently more potent than the predetermined optimal dose of 10–8 m C5a. Chemoattractants generally generate a Ca2+ influx, and S100A12 activates this response in monocytoid cells (2Yang Z. Tao T. Raftery M.J. Youssef P. Di Girolamo N. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar). Resting [Ca2+]i in BMMC increased within 3 s (9–12 s, Fig, 4B) in response to S100A12 and S100A1238–53 and was maintained over 10–12 s then declined in a manner similar to the C5a-provoked response (Fig. 4B). Ca2+ influx occurred with between 10–11 and 10–6 m S100A12 or S100A1238–53 (not shown). MC Degranulation—Because S100A12 provokes MC degranulation (4Yang Z. Yan W.X. Cai H. Tedla N. Armishaw C. Di Girolamo N. Wang H.W. Hampartzoumian T. Simpson J.L. Gibson P.G. Hunt J. Hart P. Hughes J.M. Perry M.A. Alewood P.F. Geczy C.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2007; 119: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), S100A1238–53 was tested. Both the peptide and the protein induced significantly more β-hex release than unstimulated BMMC (basal release, 4.4%; Fig. 5A). Levels of β-hex were similar with S100A12 and the peptide, with increases of 12 and 7% with S100A12 and S100A1238–53 (10 μm) and 7 and 6% with 1 μm, respectively (p < 0.001 at 10 μm; p < 0.05 at 1 μm). The capacity for degranulation was confirmed using PMC (Fig. 5B). With 10 μm S100A12 or S100A1238–53, β-hex increased 2.3- and 2.4-fold and histamine 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 5C), representing ∼30% release of total cell histamine. Although 1 μm S100A12 or S100A1238–53 provoked some degranulation (Fig. 5A), lower concentrations (<0.1 μm) were ineffective (data not shown). Leukocyte Recruitment in Vivo—S100A12 generates inflammatory changes in the microcirculation and induces a localized MC-dependent edema and leukocyte recruitment over 8 h (4Yang Z. Yan W.X. Cai H. Tedla N. Armishaw C. Di Girolamo N. Wang H.W. Hampartzoumian T. Simpson J.L. Gibson P.G. Hunt J. Hart P. Hughes J.M. Perry M.A. Alewood P.F. Geczy C.L. J. Allergy Clin.

Footpad swelling increased 60 min post-injection of S100A12 or S100A1238–53 and was sustained for up to 2 h (Fig. 6A; p < 0.05, S100A12; p < 0.01, S100A1238–53 1 or 2 h post-injection compared with vehicle control). Blood vessel permeability peaked 60 min post-injection and was similar for both preparations (see Table 1; the native peptide is represented by A41A and A51A). Histological analysis confirmed leukocyte accumulation 2 h post-injection into footpads (Fig. 6B, b and c). Marked MC degranulation was evident with S100A12 (Fig. 5B, e) and with S100A1238–53 (Fig. 6B, f) compared with vehicle (Fig. 6B, d). Total leukocyte numbers increased some 3-fold 8 h post-injection (Table 1; p < 0.01). Macrophage numbers increased ∼5-fold (p < 0.01) and MC some ∼2-fold (p < 0.05) with both S100A12 preparations. Neutrophils comprised the remainder of the leukocytes. S100A1238–53 consistently recruited more MC when injected into the skin than S100A12 (p < 0.05).TABLE 1Leukocyte recruitment after S100A12 injectionCell typeVehicleS100A12S100A1238-53Leukocytes30.77 ± 7.2997.3 ± 10.73ap < 0.01 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).91.55 ± 12.76ap < 0.01 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).MC12.22 ± 6.4518.55 ± 6.14bp < 0.05 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).25.55 ± 3.46bp < 0.05 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).,cp < 0.05 compared with S100A12.Macrophages5.77 ± 1.2225.88 ± 2.18ap < 0.01 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).25.0 ± 3.36ap < 0.01 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).a p < 0.01 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).b p < 0.05 compared with vehicle control (buffer injection).c p < 0.05 compared with S100A12.

An I40A mutation of PLB did not alter pentamer conformation but increased the concentration of half-maximal FRET (KD) by >4-fold.

These previous studies were performed using in vitro preparations of PLB in defined lipids or detergent. To investigate the quaternary structure of PLB in the membranes of living cells and distinguish between these structural models, we expressed cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins fused to the PLB N terminus and measured fluorescent protein separation distances with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (17Förster T. Ann. Phys. (Leipzig). 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4785) Google Scholar). In addition, we determined the effects of mutation of the PLB transmembrane domain on PLB oligomerization affinity, quaternary structure, and capacity to bind to its regulatory target, SERCA. Specifically, we tested a naturally occurring human mutation associated with heart failure (L39Stop) that truncates PLB midway through its transmembrane domain (18Haghighi K. Kolokathis F. Pater L. Lynch R.A. Asahi M. Gramolini A.O. Fan G.C. Tsiapras D. Hahn H.S. Adamopoulos S. Liggett S.B. Dorn 2nd, G.W. MacLennan D.H. Kremastinos D.T. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). We also investigated a pentamer-destabilizing point mutation (I40A). The I40A mutation is historically regarded as a “monomeric” mutant because of its electrophoretic mobility in the presence of detergent (19Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that I40A-PLB still forms oligomers in membranes, but compared with WT, the I40A oligomers are more dynamic, showing an increased rate of exchange of PLB subunits from the pentamer complex (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we endeavored to quantify the thermodynamic consequence of this mutation in the membranes of live cells. Rabbit SERCA1a and dog PLB fused to the C terminus of fluorescent proteins were expressed in AAV-293 cells, as previously described (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutants of PLB were created with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and custom oligonucleotide primers. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. AAV-293 cells cultured on polylysine-coated glass bottom dishes were cotransfected with plasmids encoding CFP/YFP fusion constructs, at a 5- or 20-fold excess of YFP, as previously described (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fluorescence imaging was performed with an inverted microscope equipped with a 1.49 numerical aperture objective, and a back-thinned CCD camera (iXon 887; Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland). The detector was cooled to –100 °C, using a recirculating liquid coolant system (Koolance, Inc., Auburn, WA). The system's relative sensitivity to CFP and YFP was calibrated by imaging drops of purified CFP and YFP at a series of known concentrations. Image acquisition and acceptor photobleaching was automated with custom software macros in Meta-Morph (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA) that controlled motorized excitation/emission filter wheels (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) with filters for CFP/YFP/mCherry (Semrock, Rochester NY). The progressive photobleaching protocol was as follows: 100-ms acquisition of CFP image and 40-ms acquisition of YFP image, followed by 10-s exposure to YFP-selective photobleaching (504/12-nm excitation). For intrapentameric FRET experiments, each cell's relative protein expression was assessed as a sum of the starting YFP fluorescence (prebleach) and the final CFP fluorescence after FRET was abolished (postbleach). In general, concentrations of membrane proteins and related dissociation constants (KD) are expressed as protein molar fraction (20Merzlyakov M. You M. Li E. Hristova K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or as species per unit area (e.g. mol/m2). However, expression of such absolute concentrations requires a reconstituted system of defined lipid/protein ratio. Since we endeavored to quantify the thermodynamics of oligomerization in living cells, we express our protein concentration in arbitrary units (AU). FRET efficiency was calculated from the fluorescence intensity of the CFP donor before and after acceptor-selective photobleaching, according to the relationship, E = 1 – (Fprebleach/Fpostbleach). The maximal energy transfer efficiency (FRETmax) was obtained from a hyperbolic fit of the form, y = (FRETmax)x/(KD + x), to the data of a plot of FRET dependence on protein concentration. This hyperbola “saturation” value was taken as the FRET efficiency of maximally oligomerized PLB (100% pentamer); thus, it represents the intrinsic FRET efficiency of the complex. Nearest neighbor probe separation distance R was calculated from FRETmax using a custom MatLab application of the ring oligomer energy transfer theory (21Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2587-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), assuming an oligomer subunit number of 5 (pentamer), and using the acceptor molar fraction of 0.88, determined from YFP starting and CFP final fluorescence, as described above. The model used a Förster radius (R0) of 49.2 Å for CFP-YFP energy transfer (22Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The calculated distances were used to evaluate the pinwheel and bellflower models of the PLB pentamer. Average distances between pinwheel (Protein Data Bank code 1XNU) or bellflower (Protein Data Bank code 1ZLL) nearest neighbor amino termini were measured in Pymol. The radius of the ring-shaped distribution of amino termini was calculated by the equation, rN = d/2(sinα/2), where rN represents the radius, d is the average nearest neighbor distance between amino termini, and α is the azimuthal angle of adjacent subunits arrayed about the pentamer central axis normal to the plane of the membrane. The theoretical radius of maximal reach (rmax) was obtained by adding 25 Å to rN, to account for the distance between the fluorescent protein chromaphore and fusion of the fluorescent protein to the PLB cytoplasmic domain. The radius of the ring-shaped distribution of fluorescent protein chromaphores (rFRET) was obtained from the nearest neighbor probe separation distance R calculated from intrinsic pentamer FRET efficiency (FRETmax), according to rFRET = R/2(sinα/2). The apparent attachment angle between the pinwheel cytoplasmic domain and the fluorescent protein θ that corresponds to the measured probe separation distance was obtained by the equation, θ = cos–1(rFRET – rN)/25 Å). The regulatory complex maximal FRET efficiency (FRETmax) was determined from concentration dependence, as above. This value was taken as the intrinsic FRET efficiency of the CFP-SERCA·YFP-PLB complex. The probe separation distance (R) for this heterodimeric complex was calculated according to the relationship described by Förster (17Förster T. Ann. Phys. (Leipzig). 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4785) Google Scholar), R = (R0)((1/FRETmax) – 1)⅙. The membrane partitioning of YFP-L39Stop-PLB was evaluated by comparison with CFP-WT-PLB in permeabilized cells. Cells expressing these probes were preincubated in 2 μg/ml propidium iodide, an impermeant nuclear stain. Cells were imaged for CFP, YFP, and propidium iodide fluorescence before and after the addition of the plasma membrane-selective permeabilization agent saponin at 100 μg/ml. Laser spot photobleaching was performed using the 514-nm line of an argon laser as previously described (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing WT-, I40A-, or L39Stop-PLB fused to YFP were imaged continuously by streaming acquisition, with open/close triggering of a Uniblitz shutter after 20 frames were acquired. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was observed for 40 s. To determine the accuracy of the FRET quantification method used in the present study, we expressed standard FRET constructs in AAV-293 cells and subjected them to acceptor photobleaching. Constructs C32V, C17V, and C5V are Cerulean-Venus fusion constructs in which the fluorescent proteins are separated by linkers of 32, 17, and 5 amino acids, respectively (23Koushik S.V. Chen H. Thaler C. Puhl III, H.L. Vogel S.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: L99-L101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). VCV is a two-acceptor construct, with two Venus proteins fused to Cerulean (24Thaler C. Koushik S.V. Blank P.S. Vogel S.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2736-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We obtained FRET efficiency measurements from the following sample sizes: C32V = 8; C17V = 8; C5V = 9; VCV = 12. To estimate the amount of energy transfer due to nonspecific energy transfer between unbound fluorescently labeled proteins in the membrane, competition experiments were performed using YFP-PLB and mCherry-PLB as the FRET partners competing with CFP-PLB (which cannot act as an acceptor for YFP). YFP-PLB and mCherry-PLB were expressed at a 1:1 ratio, with increasing amounts of CFP-PLB. Intrapentameric FRET in Living Cells—Epifluorescence imaging of CFP/YFP-labeled wild-type PLB showed endoplasmic reticulum-localized fluorescence (Fig. 1A) (25Waggoner J.R. Huffman J. Griffith B.N. Jones L.R. Mahaney J.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with an additional plasma membrane-localized component, as previously described (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Acceptor-selective photobleaching of YFP-PLB resulted in increased CFP-PLB fluorescence emission (Fig. 1A), indicating FRET. The time-dependent change in CFP/YFP emission is quantified in Fig. 1B. YFP-PLB was progressively bleached, resulting in an exponential decline in YFP emission (green circles) and concomitant increase in CFP emission (blue circles). To probe the stoichiometry of the oligomeric complex that gives rise to FRET, the relationship of CFP and YFP fluorescence emission was examined. The data from Fig. 1B are replotted in Fig. 1C to show that donor fluorescence versus acceptor fluorescence deviated from linearity, as expected for a donor-acceptor complex with subunit number of >2 (21Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2587-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This representation is similar to that obtained from lineout analysis of an acceptor-selective spot photobleaching target region (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, the progressive photobleaching approach provides much greater precision and surveys a larger span of the YFP bleach axis. These technical advantages permit observation of the curvature predicted by oligomer FRET theory (21Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2587-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The acceptor molar fraction was calculated from each cell's donor and acceptor fluorescence, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and was found to be very consistent between cells (mean = 0.88, S.E. = 0.002). There was no statistically significant difference in acceptor molar fraction of WT- and I40A-expressing cells. However, total expression of fluorescent PLB varied significantly (Fig. 1A). Thus, acceptor-selective photobleaching of a population of cells could probe the dependence of FRET on protein concentration. This assay was used to compare the binding energetics of WT and a pentamer-destabilizing point mutation (I40A) of the transmembrane domain (19Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Based on its electrophoretic mobility, I40A-PLB has been referred to as a monomeric PLB, but we have shown that it can still form oligomers in cell membranes (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As previously observed, the I40A mutation of PLB destabilized the pentamer form (but did not abolish oligomerization), as quantified by intrapentameric FRET. Both WT-PLB (Fig. 1D, black circles) and I40A-PLB (Fig. 1D, red triangles) showed increasing energy transfer efficiency with increasing relative protein expression level. This dependence was hyperbolic, with a similar maximal FRET efficiency (FRETmax) (Fig. 1D). The concentration (in arbitrary units) at which FRET was half-maximal was taken to represent the dissociation constant (KD). A fit of the form y = (FRETmax) x /(KD + x) gave FRETmax of 45.1 ± 1.3% for WT and 42.1 ± 1.8% for I40A. Half-maximal FRET was obtained at a concentration more than 4-fold higher for I40A (KD = 1.33 AU) than wild-type (KD = 0.32 AU). This indicates that the I40A point mutation reduces the apparent self-affinity of PLB by >4-fold. The data are summarized in Table 1. A naturally occurring human mutation of PLB, in which the codon for leucine 39 is changed to a stop codon, showed greatly reduced FRET at all concentrations (Fig. 1D, blue squares), and its KD could not be measured. In contrast to WT-PLB (Fig. 1A) and CFP-SERCA (3Robia S.L. Campbell K.S. Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Winters D.L. Thomas D.D. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), YFP-L39Stop-PLB showed diffuse fluorescence localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2). The lack of membrane partitioning was demonstrated by permeabilizing cells with the plasma membrane-selective agent saponin. This treatment provided access to an impermeant nuclear stain, propidium iodide, and caused complete loss of the soluble YFP-L39Stop-PLB, which immediately diffused out into the bath, leaving the cells dark in the YFP imaging channel (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to CFP-WT-PLB, which was unaffected by saponin permeabilization (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Summary of PLB oligomerization, quaternary structure, and SERCA bindingWT-PLBI40A-PLBL39StopMean pentamer FRET (%)37.8 ± 1.028.1 ± 1.07.4 ± 0.5Pentamer FRET sample size907218Pentamer FRETmax (%)45.1 ± 1.342.1 ± 1.8NDaND, not determined.Pentamer probe distance (Å)58.7 ± 0.559.9 ± 0.7NDPentamer KD (AU)0.32 ± 0.061.33 ± 0.20NDMonomer (%)1667>80FRAP τoverall (s)9.7 ± 0.76.8 ± 2.03.5 ± 0.4FRAP τ1 (s)2.9 ± 0.42.0 ± 2.41.6 ± 0.6FRAP τ2 (s)31 ± 9.521.5 ± 4211.4 ± 8.2FRAP fast fraction0.480.540.77Photobleach τoverall (s)135 ± 196 ± 2269 ± 1Photobleach τ1 (s)56 ± 440 ± 529 ± 2.6Photobleach τ2 (s)255 ± 20225 ± 40339 ± 6Photobleach fast fraction0.370.490.05Mean regulatory complex FRET (%)11.6 ± 0.816.2 ± 0.81.0 ± 0.4Regulatory complex FRET sample size486946Regulatory complex FRETmax (%)30 ± 1.929 ± 1.1NDRegulatory complex probe distance (Å)58.1 ± 0.958.6 ± 0.6NDRegulatory complex apparent KD (AU)12.8 ± 1.64.4 ± 0.5NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—The L39Stop and I40A mutants of PLB were found to recover from spot photobleaching more quickly than WT-PLB (Fig. 3A). The FRAP time constants (τ), obtained from a single exponential fit of the form (y = y0 + Ae(–x/τ)) to combined average recovery traces was 9.7 ± 0.7 s for WT, 6.8 ± 2.0 s for I40A, and 3.5 ± 0.4 s for L39Stop. A multiexponential fit of the form y = y0 + A1e(–x/τ1) + A1e(–x/τ2) indicated that the faster overall recovery of I40A FRAP was due in part to an increase in a fast component at the expense of a slow component (Table 1). The very rapid recovery of L39Stop is consistent with being freely diffusible in the cytoplasm. For I40A, faster FRAP, with an increased proportion of a short time constant, is suggestive of a greater population of I40A in the more rapidly diffusible monomeric form. YFP Photobleaching Rate—We quantified the rate of YFP fluorescence photobleaching as an index of homotransfer FRET (26Kubitscheck U. Kircheis M. Schweitzer-Stenner R. Dreybrodt W. Jovin T.M. Pecht I. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 307-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Young R.M. Arnette J.K. Roess D.A. Barisas B.G. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 881-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows that YFP-I40A-PLB bleached more quickly than wild type, consistent with reduced self-association and decreased homotransfer. The difference in photobleaching rates (slopes) was greatest at the beginning of the bleach time course, when acceptor density was still high and the protective effects of homotransfer were most pronounced. Single exponential fits of the form y = y + Ae(–x/τ) to combined average F/F0 data showed that the overall bleach time constants (τ) for YFP-WT-PLB and YFP-I40A-PLB were 135 ± 1 and 96 ± 2s, respectively. Multiexponential analysis of the form y = y0 + A1e(–x/τ1) + A1e(–x/τ2) to combined average F/F0 data showed that this overall decrease in photobleaching time with I40A mutation was due in part to a larger proportion of a readily bleachable fraction (A1/(A1 + A2)) at the expense of a bleach-resistant fraction (A2/(A1 + A2)) (Table 1). The shift toward the readily bleachable fraction with I40A mutation is consistent with a greater proportion of monomeric PLB. YFP-L39Stop-PLB showed very high photostability. Its photobleaching was not significantly biphasic (fast fraction = 0.05). The data were well described by a single exponential fit with τ = 269 ± 1 s (Fig. 3B). An interpretation of this unexpected result is offered under “Discussion.” Regulatory Complex FRET—FRET within regulatory complexes of CFP-SERCA and YFP-labeled WT-, I40A-, or L39Stop-PLB was also quantified by acceptor photobleaching. As expected, the I40A mutation resulted in a greater association with SERCA, which binds only the monomer form (19Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 28Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that the PLB-SERCA binding curve was left-shifted by the I40A mutation. The concentration of half-maximal FRET for I40A-PLB was 4.4 ± 0.5 AU, compared with 12.8 ± 1.6 AU for WT-PLB. The measured PLB concentration (x axis) includes both monomers and pentamers. We refer to the above values as “apparent KD values” to distinguish them from the true KD of the isolated monomer. The intrinsic FRET efficiency of the regulatory complex did not change with mutation. FRETmax was 30 ± 1.9% for WT-PLB and 29 ± 1.1% for I40A-PLB. YFP-L39Stop-PLB bound poorly to CFP-SERCA, as indicated by a very low FRET efficiency (p < 0.01 versus WT and I40A). CFP-SERCA and YFP-PLB fluorescences (F/F0) were linearly and inversely related (Fig. 4B), consistent with a bimolecular complex (21Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2587-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Quantification of FRET—To test whether the present methods accurately measured absolute FRET efficiency values, cells expressing standard FRET constructs were subjected to progressive acceptor photobleaching. FRET efficiencies thus obtained were in good agreement with published values for the standard constructs (23Koushik S.V. Chen H. Thaler C. Puhl III, H.L. Vogel S.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: L99-L101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Thaler C. Koushik S.V. Blank P.S. Vogel S.S. Biophys.

J. 2006; 91: L39-L41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 5A. Measured mean transfer efficiency values ± S.E. for C32V, C17V, C5V, and VCV were 29 ± 1, 39 ± 1, 41 ± 2, 65 ± 3%, respectively. To dissect specific (intracomplex) FRET from diffusion-enhanced FRET, we co-transfected YFP-PLB (donor) and mCherry-PLB (acceptor) with CFP-PLB (competitor), which cannot act as an acceptor for YFP-PLB. CFP-PLB fluorescence was quantified as a measure of competitor concentration. As CFP-labeled PLB increased, FRET from YFP-PLB to mCherry-PLB complexes decreased to a minimum of 3% (Fig. 5B). This constitutes an upper limit for nonspecific FRET in these studies. Significance of the Present Results—Previous determinations of PLB pentamer structure using fluorescence or magnetic resonance have used solubilized protein or PLB reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers. To our knowledge, this is the first direct measurement of the quaternary conformation of expressed PLB in the membranes of living cells. The use of genetically encoded probes permits quantification of the energetic consequence of PLB transmembrane domain mutations without exposing the protein complexes to the destabilizing effect of detergents. This strategy may be generally useful for structural and thermodynamics studies of other membrane protein complexes. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—The efficiency of FRET is very steeply dependent on probe separation distance (R), particularly for distances that are close to a probe pai"
https://openalex.org/W2138541870,"Background Cellular biological responses to specific stimulation are determined by a balance among signaling pathways. Protein interactions are likely to modulate these pathways. Vaccinia-related kinase-2 (VRK2) is a novel human kinase that can modulate different signaling pathways. Principal Findings We report that in vivo, the activity of JIP1-JNK complexes is downregulated by VRK2 in response to interleukin-1β. Also the reduction of endogenous VRK2 with shRNA increases the transcriptional response to IL-1β. The JIP1 scaffold protein assembles three consecutive members of a given MAPK pathway forming signaling complexes and their signal can be modulated by interactions with regulatory proteins that remain to be identified. Knocking-down JIP1 with siRNA resulted in elimination of the AP1 transcriptional response to IL-1β. VRK2, a member of novel Ser-Thr kinase family, is able to stably interact with JIP1, TAK1 and MKK7, but not JNK, and can be isolated forming oligomeric complexes with different proportions of TAK1, MKK7β1 and JNK. JIP1 assembles all these proteins in an oligomeric signalosome. VRK2 binding to the JIP1 signalosome prevents the association of JNK and results in a reduction in its phosphorylation and downregulation of AP1-dependent transcription. Conclusions/Significance This work suggests that the intracellular level of VRK2 protein can modulate the flow through a signaling pathway and alter the response from a receptor that can be distributed by more than one pathway, and thus contribute to the cellular specificity of the response by forming alternative signaling complexes. Furthermore, the effect might be more general and affect other signaling routes assembled on the JIP1 scaffold protein for which a model is proposed."

Ikaros also functions as a tumor suppressor in the T cell lineage as evidenced by the 100% penetrance of T cell leukemogenesis observed in genetically engineered Ikaros-deficient mice (4Winandy S.

The Notch receptor is also essential for T cell development and its constitutive activation also leads to T leukemogenesis in mice (7Radtke F. Wilson A. Stark G. Bauer M. van Meerwijk J.

Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of cooperative function of Ikaros and Notch, which likely also contributes to the normal developmental process, is unknown.The Notch receptor is a transmembrane protein that undergoes two proteolytic cleavage events upon recognition of its extracellular ligand (members of the Delta or Serrate/Jagged family) (14Schweisguth F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R129-R138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cleavages free the intracellular domain, which travels to the nucleus. In the nucleus, intracellular Notch regulates transcription of Notch target genes through its binding to and activation of the transcriptional repressor CSL (designated RBP-Jκ/CBF-1 in mammals). Ikaros and RBP-Jκ (RBP-J) are able to bind to the same DNA sequences in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and it has been suggested that they may compete for binding (10Dumortier A. Jeannet R. Kirstetter P. Kleinmann E. Sellars M. dos Santos N.R. Thibault C. Barths J. Ghysdael J. Punt J.A. Kastner P. Chan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).The mammalian Notch family consists of four receptors, Notch1, -2, -3, and -4 (15Baron M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although thymocytes express Notch1, -2, and -3 (16Felli M.P. Maroder M. Mitsiadis T.A. Campese A.F. Bellavia D. Vacca A. Mann R.S. Frati L. Lendahl U. Gulino A. Screpanti I. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a non-redundant essential role in T cell development has only been established for Notch1 (7Radtke F. Wilson A. Stark G. Bauer M. van Meerwijk J. MacDonald H.R. Aguet M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). However, constitutively active forms of Notch1, Notch2, or Notch3 expressed as a transgene in mouse bone marrow can lead to T cell leukemogenesis (9Aster J.C. Pear W.S. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2001; 8: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests that whereas Notch1 may be the critical Notch receptor for T cell development, deregulation of any Notch is sufficient to induce leukemogenesis. Leukemogenesis induced by constitutively active Notch is similar in phenotype to that induced by Ikaros deficiency, suggesting that Ikaros and Notch lie in a linear pathway during T cell development. In both cases, leukemia is specific for the T cell lineage, arises within thymocyte population, and requires pre-TCR or TCR signaling (2Winandy S. Wu L. Wang J.H. Georgopoulos K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Wang J.H. Nichogiannopoulou A. Wu L. Sun L. Sharpe A.H. Bigby M. Georgopoulos K.

Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Despite the importance of Notch1 in leukemogenesis and T cell development, only a handful of direct Notch target genes have been identified in developing T cells (18Reizis B. Leder P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Anderson A.C. Robey E.A. Huang Y.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the first described target genes for Notch-induced transcriptional activation was the gene encoding the transcriptional repressor, Hairy Enhancer of Split-1 (Hes1) (20Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Hes1, like Notch1, is essential for T cell development (21Tomita K. Hattori M. Nakamura E. Nakanishi S. Minato N. Kageyama R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although most Hes1 gene targets that are important in regulation of T cell development are unknown, two potential targets have been defined. CD4 was the first identified target for Hes1 repressive activity in T cells (22Kim H.K. Siu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7166-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Allen III, R.D. Kim H.K. Sarafova S.D. Siu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3071-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p27kip1 also has been identified as a potential Hes1 target (24Murata K. Hattori M. Hirai N. Shinozuka Y. Hirata H. Kageyama R. Sakai T. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD4 and p27kip1 are also potential Ikaros target genes because their expression is up-regulated upon re-introduction of Ikaros into the JE131 Ikaros null T leukemia cell line (6Kathrein K.L. Lorenz R. Minniti Innes A. Griffiths E. Winandy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because of this potential connection, we began to investigate the role of Ikaros in regulation of Hes1.In this report, we demonstrate that Ikaros is an obligate repressor of Hes1. We show that Ikaros-mediated repression is accomplished through direct binding within regulatory elements of Hes1 and provide evidence that Ikaros binds these sequences in a cooperative fashion with RBP-J. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism of Notch target gene repression whereby RBP-J is an inefficient repressor in the absence of Ikaros. In addition, we show that the role of Ikaros in Hes1 repression contributes to the mechanism underlying Ikaros-induced expression of CD4 in JE131 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Cell Culture—JE131 cells were derived from the thymus of an Ikaros null mouse with spontaneous T cell leukemia as previously described (6Kathrein K.L. Lorenz R. Minniti Innes A. Griffiths E. Winandy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (RPMI complete). For inhibitor assays, equal volumes of the γ-secretase inhibitor N,N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l -alanyl-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) 3The abbreviations used are: DAPT, N,N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; ICN, intracellular Notch1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; GSI, γ-secretase inhibitor. (Calbiochem) resuspended in Me2SO or the carrier (Me2SO) were added to cultures.Protein Preparation and Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were prepared by cell lysis with 420 mm NaCl Lysis Buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with leupeptin (4 μg/ml), aprotonin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 μg/ml). Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation. 30 μg/lane of protein extracts were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline, 5% milk. Antibodies against cleaved Notch1-Val-1744 (Cell Signaling Technology) were diluted 1:500 in Tris-buffered saline, 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline 3 times for 5 min and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and exposure to film.Retroviral Constructs—MSCV IRES H-2Kk and MSCV IRES Ik-1 H-2Kk constructs were described previously (6Kathrein K.L. Lorenz R. Minniti Innes A. Griffiths E. Winandy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ikaros mutants were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis (25Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). 5′ and 3′ end primers used to insert restriction enzyme sites for cloning were (5′ to 3′): 5′ extension (BglII), GCCGACCGTCAGATCTATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG; 3′ extension (XhoI), GCTGTAGGAATTCGCTGTAGCTCGAGTTAGCTCAGGTGGTAACGATGCTCC. Mutation introducing primers: F2 DBD forward, GCCTCCTTTACCCGGAAAGGCAACCTCC; F2 DBD reverse, GGAGGTTGCCTTTCCGGGTAAAGGAGGC; F3 DBD forward, TGCCTGCCGCCAGAGGGACGCCCT; and F3 DBD reverse, AGGGCGTCCCTCTGGCGGCAGGCA. Following BglII-XhoI restriction enzyme digest of PCR products, mutant Ik-1 sequences were subcloned into MSCV IRES H-2Kk. All constructs were sequenced at the University of Chicago Cancer Research DNA Sequencing Facility. MSCV IRES Hes1 GFP was a gift of Dr. Warren Pear (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).Retroviral Transduction and Magnetic Cell Sorting—Retroviral plasmid constructs were transfected into Phoenix ecotropic packaging cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were harvested at 48 and 72 h postinfection, passed through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored at –80 °C. JE131 cells were infected using 1 ml of supernatant per 2 × 106 cells supplemented with 8 μg/ml of Polybrene in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Plates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 h at 32 °C. Supernatants were removed and cells were cultured with RPMI complete medium. Successfully transduced cells were sorted with the MiniMacs system (Miltenyi) using the H-2Kk expression marker as previously described (6Kathrein K.L. Lorenz R. Minniti Innes A. Griffiths E. Winandy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purity was assessed using the MACSelect control fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody and was consistently >90%.Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometric analyses, the following antibodies were used: anti-CD4 (GK1.5, eBiosciences), anti-CD8 (53-6.7, eBiosciences), MACSelect control fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Miltenyi Biotech), and anti-H-2Kk (H100-27.R55, Miltenyi Biotech). Antibodies were allophycocyanin, fluorescein isothiocyanate, or phycoerythrin conjugates. For staining, cells were plated in microwell staining plates at 5 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells per well. Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were added to cells and incubated on ice for 15 min. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer using CellQuest Pro software.RT-PCR—mRNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from H-2Kk positive retrovirally transduced JE131 cells sorted 24 h postinfection or JE131 cells treated with DAPT for 36 h. cDNA was generated using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using a Bio-Rad iQ5 Real Time PCR machine and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Analyses of qRT-PCR were performed using the Pfaffl method. Primers were designed using Beacon Design software and synthesized by IDT DNA Technologies. Primer sequences are available upon request.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using chromatin prepared from H-2Kk positive JE131 cells infected with MSCV IRES H-2Kk or MSCV IRES Ik-1 H-2Kk retroviruses at 24 h postinfection using the ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate). Briefly, 106 cells were used per sample. Proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked by treating cells with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, lysed, and sonicated (Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 100) to shear DNA. Samples were precleared with Protein G or Protein A-agarose/salmon sperm beads (Upstate). Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using the ChIP Assay Kit (Millipore; catalog number 17-295) and antibodies against Ikaros, RBP-J (Santa Cruz and Chemicon), anti-acetylated histone H3 (Upstate), or a control IgG (Santa Cruz). Complexes were collected with Protein G or Protein A-agarose/salmon sperm beads and washed. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted off the beads and cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight. DNA was recovered by phenol:chloroform extraction and precipitated by ethanol. qPCR analyses were performed on immunoprecipitated DNA and normalized to total chromatin input using the Pfaffl method. Primers were used with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and were as follows (5′ to 3′): Hes1 forward, CTGTGGGAAAGAAAGTTTGGGAAG; Hes1 reverse, GCTCCAGATCCTGTGTGATCC; upstream 1 kb forward, CTCCCTTGTCCGCCGTCTATCC; upstream 1 kb reverse, CGCTCGTTCCTCCGCCACTCTC; upstream 7 kb forward, GAGAGGCAACCACGGACTTG; upstream 7 kb reverse, ACAGGCTCCAGGCACCAC; downstream 1 kb forward, GCGTGCGTCCCCTCTCTG; downstream 1 kb reverse, GCTGAATGCCTCTCACAACCG; downstream 2.5 kb forward, GCGGCTCCCAACTCACTCC; downstream 2.5 kb reverse, ACAGACAAATGAAGGTCCCAATGC; Deltex 1 forward, TCAGCCAGATTACATCCATTAGTC; Deltex1 reverse, CAGAGAGGTTACTCAGTTTGTCC.For ChIP-Western blot, ChIP was performed with anti-Ikaros monoclonal antibodies or control IgG. Chromatin utilized was derived from 5 × 106 magnetically sorted H-2Kk positive JE131 cells infected with MSCV IRES H-2Kk or MSCV IRES Ik-1 H-2Kk retroviruses. Immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted from beads by incubation in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 10 min and subjected to Western blot analyses using antibodies against RBP-J (Chemicon) or Ikaros.RESULTSRestoration of Ikaros Results in Down-regulation of Hes1 Expression in an Ikaros Null T Leukemia Cell Line with Activated Notch—The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Hes1, has previously been shown to repress expression of the T cell differentiation marker, CD4, and the cell cycle regulator, p27kip1 (22Kim H.K. Siu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7166-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Allen III, R.D. Kim H.K. Sarafova S.D. Siu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3071-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Murata K. Hattori M. Hirai N. Shinozuka Y. Hirata H. Kageyama R. Sakai T. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, reintroduction of Ikaros to the JE131 Ikaros null T leukemia cell line has been shown to up-regulate both CD4 and p27kip1 (6Kathrein K.L. Lorenz R. Minniti Innes A. Griffiths E. Winandy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that up-regulation of CD4 and p27kip1 in JE131 cells transduced with Ikaros may be the result of reduced expression of Hes1. This reduction would relieve Hes1-induced repression of CD4 and p27kip1. To begin to address this possibility, Hes1 expression was analyzed in JE131 cells transduced with the Ikaros isoform, Ik-1 (Ik-1) or the negative control retrovirus (Ik–). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of cDNA prepared from JE131 cells without Ikaros revealed high levels of Hes1 expression. JE131 cells transduced with Ik-1, however, displayed a dramatic down-regulation of Hes1 expression (Fig. 1A).Notch signaling up-regulates Hes1 expression, suggesting that high Hes1 expression in JE131 cells may result from activated Notch in these cells. In support of this, it was reported that T leukemia cell lines arising from mice with greatly diminished Ikaros expression (Ik L/L mice) (10Dumortier A. Jeannet R. Kirstetter P. Kleinmann E. Sellars M. dos Santos N.R. Thibault C. Barths J. Ghysdael J. Punt J.A. Kastner P. Chan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) constitutively express intracellular Notch (ICN), the active form of Notch. Therefore, JE131 cells were examined for the presence of ICN. Whole cell extracts from JE131 cells prepared and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-ICN specific antibody showed that ICN was constitutively generated in JE131 cells (Fig. 1B). It is important to note that although the generation of ICN in JE131 cells is likely to contribute to deregulation of Hes1 expression in JE131 cells, reintroduction of Ikaros alone is sufficient to down-regulate expression of Hes1.Treatment with γ-Secretase Inhibitor Has Minimal Effect on Proliferation of JE131 Cells—Notch signaling is required to maintain proliferation and viability of many murine and human T leukemia cell lines (26Weng A.P. Ferrando A.A. Lee W. Morris J.P. Silverman L.B. Sanchez-Irizarry C. Blacklow S.C. Look A.T. Aster J.C. Science. 2004; 306: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 27Pear W.S. Aster J.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2004; 16: 426-433Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The presence of ICN and a high level of Hes1 expression in JE131 cells suggests that ICN may function to promote the leukemic phenotype of these cells through the constitutive activation of Notch signaling. Given these data, we next determined if generation of ICN was essential for viability and/or proliferation of JE131 cells. For these studies, the pharmacological γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI), DAPT was utilized. DAPT blocks cleavage of Notch, preventing formation of ICN and its translocation to the nucleus. Previous data have shown that addition of GSI to rapidly growing mouse leukemia cell lines that express ICN frequently results in G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis (10Dumortier A. Jeannet R. Kirstetter P. Kleinmann E. Sellars M. dos Santos N.R. Thibault C. Barths J. Ghysdael J. Punt J.A. Kastner P. Chan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28O'Neil J.

In particular, 5 μm DAPT has been shown to be sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in murine T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines with activating Notch1 mutations (28O'Neil J. Calvo J. McKenna K. Krishnamoorthy V. Aster J.C. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Kelliher M. Look A.T. Blood. 2006; 107: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, addition of 5 or 1 μm DAPT to JE131 cells had a minimal effect on their ability to proliferate (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2The γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, has minimal effects on growth of an Ikaros null leukemia cell line, but leads to up-regulation of CD4. A, 2.5 × 105JE131 cells were cultured with 5 μm DAPT, 1 μm DAPT, 5 μl of Me2SO (DMSO), or 1 μm Me2SO in a 24-well plate. Counts of viable cells were performed every 24 h. Graphs depict results of two experiments with error bars (±S.D.).

Blots were probed with antibodies directed against ICN that has been properly cleaved at Val-1744. Blots were also probed with anti-actin antibodies as a loading control. C, qRT-PCR analyses of Hes1 expression were performed using cDNA prepared from JE131 cells treated with 5 μm DAPT, 1 μm DAPT, 5 μl of Me2SO, or 1 μl of Me2SO. y axis shows gene expression normalized to expression of the housekeeping gene, HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase).

D, JE131 cells treated with 5 μm DAPT, 1 μm DAPT, 5 μl of Me2SO, or 1 μl of Me2SO for 4 days were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD4 and CD8. Representative flow cytometric dot plots are shown. Bar graph depicts results of three experiments with error bars (±S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the efficiency of DAPT treatment, ICN levels were measured by Western blot analyses using protein extracts prepared after 5 days of culture. In DAPT-treated cells, a decrease in levels of ICN was observed compared with Me2SO-treated controls (Fig. 2B). Therefore, high levels of ICN are not required for viability and proliferation of JE131 cells. This is in contrast to JE131 cells transduced with Ikaros, which undergo rapid cell cycle arrest (6Kathrein K.L. Lorenz R. Minniti Innes A. Griffiths E. Winandy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that the proliferative capacity of JE131 cells is primarily dependent upon lack of Ikaros rather than generation of ICN.Reduction of ICN Levels Leads to Reduced Expression of Hes1 and Up-regulation of the T Cell Differentiation Marker, CD4—To verify that the reduction observed in levels of ICN was sufficient to effect Notch target gene expression, Hes1 expression was analyzed. qRT-PCR was performed on cDNA generated from JE131 cells treated with DAPT or Me2SO (negative control). Treatment of JE131 cells with DAPT led to a decrease in Hes1 expression compared with that observed in cells treated with Me2SO (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the reduction in ICN levels that occurred as a result of DAPT treatment was sufficient to reduce Hes1 expression in JE131 cells, even though proliferation was unaffected.The phenotype of the JE131 cells, CD4-CD8-TCR-CD44-CD25+, places them at the DN3 stage of T cell development. Reintroduction of Ikaros in these cells induces a T cell-specific program of gene expression in which expression of T cell differentiation markers such as CD4 and CD8 are up-regulated (6Kathrein K.L. Lorenz R. Minniti Innes A. Griffiths E. Winandy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because Hes1 has been implicated in repression of CD4 (22Kim H.K. Siu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7166-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Allen III, R.D. Kim H.K. Sarafova S.D. Siu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3071-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and DAPT reduces Hes1 expression levels, we hypothesized that JE131 cells grown in the presence of DAPT may up-regulate CD4 as do those transduced with Ikaros. Indeed, JE131 cells treated with DAPT up-regulate CD4 (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that inactivation of Notch signaling is sufficient to induce CD4 expression in JE131 cells, even in the absence of Ikaros. Note that this is not the case for CD8 (Fig. 2D).Forced Expression of Hes1 in the Presence of Ikaros Interferes with High Level CD4 Expression—In JE131 cells, reintroduction of Ikaros and treatment with DAPT both result in up-regulation of CD4 and down-regulation of Hes1, indicating that in Ikaros-transduced JE131 cells, CD4 up-regulation may result from repression of Hes1 by Ikaros. To test this, JE131 cells were co-transduced with Hes1 and Ikaros (Ik-1) to force continued high-level expression of Hes1 in the presence of Ikaros, where it would normally be down-regulated. In co-transduced JE131 cells, expression levels of CD4 differed from those observed in JE131 cells transduced with Ikaros alone. More specifically, co-transduction with Hes1 decreased Ikaros' ability to induce high-level expression of CD4 (Fig. 3A). These data provide evidence that up-regulation of CD4 observed in Ikaros-transduced JE131 cells is partially induced by Ikaros-driven repression of Hes1.FIGURE 3Preventing down-regulation of Hes1 decreases Ikaros' ability to induce high-level expression of CD4. A, JE131 cells were infected with MSCV IRES GFP and MSCV IRES Ik-1 H-2Kk (Ik-1 alone) or MSCV IRES Hes-1 GFP and MSCV IRES Ik-1 H-2Kk (Hes1/Ik-1) retroviruses, and sorted for H-2Kk expression using magnetic beads. Four days post-infection, cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD4 and CD8. Flow cytometric dot plots depict CD4 and CD8 staining for GFP positive cells in each culture. “High” CD4 expression appears in the upper right and upper left quadrants of each plot. Percentages of cells that fall into each quadrant are shown. Bar graph depicts results of two experiments with error bars (±S.D.). B, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of p27kip1 expression was performed using cDNA from JE131 transduced with Ik–, Ik-1, or Ik-1 and Hes1 retroviruses. Twenty-four hours post-infection, JE131 cells were purified using H-2Kk and GFP as markers of successful transduction. cDNA was prepared and analyzed. Expression of p27kip1 and the housekeeping gene, HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), are shown for each population. The shaded triangle above the blots indicates decreasing amounts of cDNA. C, 24 h postinfection, 3.0 × 105 sorted JE131 cells successfully transduced with Ik–, Ik-1, or Ik-1 and Hes retroviruses were cultured in RPMI complete media in a 48-well plate. Counts of viable cells were performed every 24 h. Graph represents results of two experiments performed in quadruplicate with error bars (±S.D.). On day 4 post-infection, average cell counts/ml were 4.25 × 103 (Ik-1/Hes), 1.17 × 105 (Ik-1/GFP), and 1.86 × 106 (H-2K/GFP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hes1 has been implicated as a repressor of p27kip1, and p27kip1 levels increase upon expression of Ikaros in the Ikaros null JE131 cells (6Kathrein K.L.

https://openalex.org/W2092853099,"Previous studies have revealed many parallels in the cell cycle regulation of the Ace2 and Swi5 transcription factors. Although both proteins begin entry into the nucleus near the start of mitosis, here we show that Ace2 accumulates in the nucleus and binds DNA about 10 min later in the cell cycle than Swi5. We used chimeric fusions to identify the N-terminal region of Ace2 as responsible for the delay, and this same region of Ace2 was required for interaction with Cbk1, a kinase necessary for both transcriptional activation by Ace2 and asymmetric distribution of Ace2. Ace2 and Swi5 also showed differences in prevalence during the cell cycle. Swi5 is apparently degraded soon after nuclear entry, whereas constant Ace2 levels throughout the cell cycle suggest Ace2 is exported from the nucleus. Our work suggests that the precise timing of Ace2 accumulation in the nucleus involves both a nuclear export sequence and a nuclear localization signal, whose activities are regulated by phosphorylation.

Ace2 and Swi5 are yeast transcription factors with a number of similarities. Previous work has shown that ACE2 and SWI5 are both transcribed during the G2 portion of the cell cycle, and the Ace2 and Swi5 proteins accumulate in the nucleus at roughly the same time early in M phase (1Moll T.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Additionally the zinc finger DNA-binding domains of the two proteins are nearly identical, and Ace2 and Swi5 recognize the same DNA sequences in vitro (3Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S.

In contrast, Swi5 is required for HO expression, whereas Ace2 is unable to activate HO (3Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J.

The G2-specific transcription of the ACE2 and SWI5 genes is due to binding sites for the Mcm1-Fkh2-Ndd1 complex in both promoters (6Hollenhorst P.C. Bose M.E. Mielke M.R. Muller U. Fox C.A.

Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Swi5 is dephosphorylated at anaphase by the Cdc14 phosphatase (11Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Importantly mutation of the three phosphorylated serine residues in Swi5 responsible for down-regulation of the NLS results in constitutive nuclear localization of Swi5. The amino acids in Swi5 that are phosphorylated to regulate nuclear localization are conserved in Ace2 (3Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and mutation of these residues results in constitutive nuclear localization (12O'Conallain C. Doolin M.T. Taggart C. Thornton F. Butler G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Ace2 interacts with the Crm1 nuclear export receptor and contains a nuclear export sequence (NES) (13Jensen T.H. Neville M. Rain J.C. McCarthy T. Legrain P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8047-8058Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A GFP-Ace2 fusion is cytoplasmic, but it is nuclear in the presence of the leptomycin B nuclear export inhibitor (13Jensen T.H. Neville M. Rain J.C. McCarthy T. Legrain P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8047-8058Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or in cells with a mutation in the CRM1 nuclear export protein (14Weiss E.L. Kurischko C. Zhang C. Shokat K. Drubin D.G. Luca F.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 885-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Importantly a GFP-Swi5 fusion does not respond to leptomycin B. Leucine residues are an essential part of all previously characterized NESs, but mutagenesis of this putative NES region in Ace2 shows that leucines are not required for NES activity, and thus Ace2 has a novel NES (13Jensen T.H. Neville M. Rain J.C. McCarthy T. Legrain P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8047-8058Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Chimeric fusions between Ace2 and Swi5 have been used to identify functional domains (15McBride H.J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21029-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 83-amino acid DNA-binding domains of Ace2 and Swi5 are highly conserved (83% identity and 94% similarity), and 30–50 residues on either side of the zinc fingers, including the NLSs, are also conserved. The N-terminal regions of Ace2 and Swi5 (578 and 524 amino acids, respectively) are not well conserved with only 18% identity through this region. However, there are three small blocks (20–27 amino acids) of similarity in this large region (see Fig. 1A). We used these small islands of homology as junctions for chimeric fusions in the hope that such fusions would fold properly; all of our fusions are expressed at wild type levels and are able to activate at least a subset of target genes (15McBride H.J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21029-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, we defined six regions of each protein where A, B, C, and D are N-terminal to the zinc fingers, E comprises the zinc finger region, and F is the C-terminal region (see Fig. 1A). Studies with these chimeric fusions demonstrated that the zinc fingers do not determine which target genes are activated. Instead region C of Ace2 is required for activation of CTS1, and region D of Swi5 is required for HO expression (15McBride H.J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21029-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover region D of Swi5 interacts directly with the Pho2 homeodomain protein and the Gal11(Med15) subunit of the Mediator complex (16Bhoite L.T. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Bhoite L.T. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6436-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly sequences within regions A/B of Swi5 are required for HO expression in a pho2 mutant strain but not in PHO2 cells (18McBride H.J. Brazas R.M. Yu Y. Nasmyth K. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Transcriptional activation by Ace2 is severely reduced by mutations in the RAM (regulation of Ace2 activity and cellular morphogenesis) network of genes (19Nelson B. Kurischko C. Horecka J. Mody M. Nair P. Pratt L. Zougman A. McBroom L.D. Hughes T.R. Boone C. Luca F.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3782-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these genes, CBK1, MOB2, KIC1, HYM1, and TAO3, results in similar phenotypes, including defects in bud site selection, apical growth of the emerging bud, response to mating pheromone, morphogenesis of mating projections, and cell separation after mitosis (19Nelson B. Kurischko C. Horecka J. Mody M. Nair P. Pratt L. Zougman A. McBroom L.D. Hughes T.R. Boone C. Luca F.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3782-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Racki W.J.

Cell. 2005; 4: 1018-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cell separation defects of RAM network mutants resemble those of ace2 mutants because expression of Ace2 target genes is sharply reduced in these mutants. Our genetics experiments show that ACE2 overexpression can suppress some defects of RAM network mutations, demonstrating that the RAM genes act upstream of Ace2 (22Voth W.P. Olsen A.E. Sbia M. Freedman K.H. Stillman D.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1018-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For the current study we used strains with the CBK1 kinase deleted; Cbk1 enzymatic activity requires the Mob2 partner (19Nelson B. Kurischko C. Horecka J. Mody M. Nair P. Pratt L. Zougman A. McBroom L.D. Hughes T.R. Boone C. Luca F.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3782-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and a critical regulatory phosphorylation of Cbk1 requires interaction with Ace2, one of its target proteins (23Jansen J.M. Barry M.F. Yoo C.K. Weiss E.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Ace2 protein normally accumulates only in the nucleus of daughters in wild type cells (14Weiss E.L. Kurischko C. Zhang C. Shokat K. Drubin D.G. Luca F.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 885-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Colman-Lerner A. Chin T.E. Brent R. Cell. 2001; 107: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Ace2 is present in both mother and daughter cells in cbk1 or mob2 mutants, and thus Cbk1/Mob2 is required for specific localization of Ace2 in daughter cells.Transcription factor activity can be regulated by control of subcellular localization, acting on NLS and NES elements (25Poon I.K. Jans D.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). NLS elements consist of basic amino acids, and nearby phosphorylation can change the charge and thus inactivate the NLS. Phosphorylation to inactivate an NLS was originally identified in Swi5 (1Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and has been seen in a number of transcription factors, including FoxO1, mPer1, Msn2, NF-AT, and Swi6 (25Poon I.K. Jans D.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For other factors, such as Dorsal, SRY, T-antigen, and Xnf7, acetylation or phosphorylation at sites near the NLS can enhance binding to the import receptor and thus facilitate nuclear import. Similarly the activity of an NES element can be modulated by post-translational modification as with Crz1, FoxO1, Mig1, p53, Pho4, and PRAK. For example, the Pho4 NES is phosphorylated when cells are grown in high phosphate medium, enhancing NES activity and protein export.An NLS can also be hidden by another molecule, such as the masking of the NF-κB NLS by I-κB; phosphorylation of I-κB results in its degradation, exposing the NLS of NF-κB and causing nuclear entry. The Cdc25, FoxO1, and TERT proteins are regulated by masking involving the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which recognize phosphorylated serine residues within a specific sequence context. Phosphorylation of FoxO1 results in 14-3-3 binding, masking the NLS, and blocking nuclear import. Finally changes in redox state can cause protein conformational changes due to disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues. This can lead to masking of the NLS or NES in Pap1 or Yap1, respectively, and change nuclear accumulation.Thus there are multiple mechanisms to regulate nuclear localization, and these respond to signal transduction signals, developmental timing, metabolic signals, or cell cycle timing (25Poon I.K. Jans D.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Importantly there are a number of proteins that show regulation of both their NLS and NES elements, including Crz1, FoxO1, Msn2, NF-AT, Pho4, and PRAK.In this report we show that the Ace2 and Swi5 factors accumulate in the nucleus and bind DNA at different times. Ace2 accumulated in the nucleus about 10 min later than Swi5, and the two proteins showed marked differences in protein accumulation during the cell cycle. We used protein chimeras between Ace2 and Swi5 to identify regions A/B of Ace2 as important for this cell cycle delay, and these regions were also required for daughter-specific localization and for responsiveness to the Cbk1 kinase. Finally mutating both the NES and eliminating the inhibition of the NLS by phosphorylation resulted in a constitutively nuclear Ace2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Media—All yeast strains used are listed in supplemental Table 1 and are isogenic in the W303 background (26Thomas B.J.

To arrest cells with α-factor, log phase cells were grown in YM-1 medium at 25 °C, and α-factor (University of Utah Peptide Synthesis Core Facility) was added to 3 μm; within 90–120 min 95% showed morphology indicating G1 arrest, and samples were taken for Western analysis.Antibodies—Polyclonal antisera to Ace2 and Swi5 were made by expressing in Escherichia coli a maltose-binding protein fusion to Ace2 residues 1–1467 and a His tag fusion to Swi5 residues 1–709 and injecting into rabbits. Anti-Myc antibody was either 9E11 (Abcam or GeneTex) or 4A6 (Upstate).Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown in synthetic complete medium supplemented with 0.025% adenine. Cells were synchronized with GALp:CDC20 arrest and release as described above. For the double labeling experiment in Fig. 2D, rhodamine anti-mouse and fluorescein anti-rabbit were used as secondary antibodies along with mouse anti-Myc and rabbit anti-Ace2 antibodies. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining for nuclear DNA was performed as described previously (30Pringle J.R.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were analyzed by real time PCR and normalized first to an open reading frame-free chromosome I region (31Mason P.B. Struhl K. Mol.

Oligonucleotides used for S1 protection or for ChIP PCR are listed in supplemental Table 3. Western blots were performed with antibodies to Ace2, Swi5, and Myc using the ECL Western kit (GE Healthcare) or with fluorescent secondary antibodies and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). Quantitative measurements of β-galactosidase activity from the strain with an integrated CTS1-lacZ reporter were performed as described previously (33Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).RESULTSRegions A/B of Ace2 Are Required for Cbk1-dependent Activation and Cbk1 Interaction—The CBK1 gene encodes a protein kinase that interacts with Ace2, and cbk1 mutations change the localization of Ace2 and reduce expression of genes activated by Ace2 (20Racki W.J. Becam A.M. Nasr F. Herbert C.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Voth W.P. Olsen A.E. Sbia M. Freedman K.H. Stillman D.J. Eukaryot.

To address whether a cbk1 gene disruption affects the amount or the electrophoretic forms of Ace2, we performed Western immunoblots with rabbit polyclonal antisera using extracts from isogenic strains. A cbk1 mutation did not significantly affect the Ace2 protein visible on the Western blot (Fig. 1B). We also examined the Swi5 protein, as Swi5 and Ace2 are related transcription factors with similar patterns of cell cycle regulation, and determined that a cbk1 mutation has little effect on Swi5 protein.Activation of CTS1 by Ace2 requires the Cbk1 kinase for activation. Ace2 and Swi5 have nearly identical DNA-binding domains, but the N-terminal regions are quite different. Previously we have described chimeric fusions between Ace2 and Swi5 and how specific portions of the non-conserved N-terminal regions contribute to transcriptional activation of specific target genes (15McBride H.J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21029-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We used these chimeric fusions between Ace2 and Swi5 to identify the regions of Ace2 required for regulation of CTS1 expression by the Cbk1 kinase. CTS1 mRNA was measured using an S1 nuclease protection assay and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Fig. 1C). Protein chimeras between Ace2 and Swi5 were able to activate CTS1 expression if they contain region C of Ace2 consistent with our previous results (15McBride H.J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21029-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, not all of the chimeras that can activate CTS1 were dependent on CBK1. Wild type Ace2 (line 1), the Ace2(ABC)-Swi5(DEF) chimera (line 4), and the Ace2(ABCD)-Swi5(EF) chimera (line 5) all showed reduced CTS1 activation in a cbk1 mutant. In contrast, a cbk1 mutation did not substantially affect the ability of the Swi5(AB)-Ace2(CDEF) chimera or the Swi5(AB)-Ace2(C)-Swi5(DEF) three-part chimera to activate CTS1 (lines 6 and 9). Therefore it appears that, although region C is required for CTS1 activation, regions A/B are required to make this activation CBK1-dependent.We performed experiments to address what region of Ace2 is required for physical interaction with Cbk1. Racki et al. (20Racki W.J. Becam A.M. Nasr F. Herbert C.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) did a two-hybrid screen using a Gal4-DNA-binding domain-Cbk1 fusion as bait, and identified Ace2-(220–306) as interacting with Cbk1. This part of Ace2 is within region B, which we have defined as amino acids 201–301 (15McBride H.J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21029-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We constructed and tested a LexA-Cbk1 fusion and found it to be a very strong activator of a lacZ reporter with LexA binding sites in the promoter (Fig. 1D) in the absence of an activation domain provided by a two-hybrid partner. These results are not in conflict as Racki et al. (20Racki W.J. Becam A.M. Nasr F. Herbert C.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) used 3-aminotriazole as part of their two-hybrid screen with a HIS3 reporter, and thus higher levels of reporter gene expression were required for a valid two-hybrid signal. Importantly we found that the ability of LexA-Cbk1 to activate the LexA-lacZ reporter is substantially reduced in the absence of Ace2 (Fig. 1D). The Ace2 dependence suggests that LexA-Cbk1 is not itself an activator but that interaction with Ace2 recruits the activation domain present in the Ace2 protein. Mob2 may function as a specificity subunit of the Cbk1-Mob2 kinase (14Weiss E.L. Kurischko C. Zhang C. Shokat K. Drubin D.G. Luca F.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 885-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and thus it is consistent that LexA-Cbk1 requires Mob2 for interaction with Ace2 (Fig. 1D).Because the LexA-Cbk1 fusion protein is an ACE2-dependent transcriptional activator, we used the Ace2-Swi5 chimeras to determine what portions of Ace2 are required for strong activation by LexA-Cbk1 (Fig. 1E). Strong activation was seen in the strain with Ace2 (line 1), and this was normalized to 100%. Three of the Ace2-Swi5 chimeras facilitated strong transcriptional activation by LexA-Cbk1 (lines 3, 4, and 5), whereas four chimeras displayed essentially no LexA-Cbk1 activity. Interestingly three of the chimeras showed higher activity (2–6.5-fold) than native Ace2. All of the chimeras are expressed at levels similar to that of native Ace2 (15McBride H.J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21029-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the presence of regions C and D of Ace2 limit transcriptional activation in this assay or that regions C and D of Swi5 stimulate transcriptional activation. The three chimeras active in this assay all contain Ace2 regions A/B, suggesting that these regions of Ace2 are sufficient for interaction with LexA-Cbk1.To further characterize the Ace2-Cbk1 interaction, we constructed two-hybrid plasmids containing various regions of Ace2 fused in frame to the Gal4 activation domain (GAD). An ace2 swi5 mutant strain with an integrated LexA-lacZ reporter was transformed with both the LexA-Cbk1 fusion plasmid and one of the various GAD-Ace2 fusion plasmids. Expression of the lacZ reporter was measured to assess the two-hybrid interaction (Fig. 1F). The results show that neither regions A nor C alone provided two-hybrid activation, whereas region B provided very modest activation in this assay. In contrast, GAD fusions with regions B-C and A-B-C provided strong and very strong activation, respectively. Assuming that the degree of two-hybrid activation reflects the level of interaction between two proteins, this suggests that regions A, B, and C of Ace2 are all required for strong interaction with Cbk1. We considered the possibility that the differences in the stability of the various GAD-Ace2 fusions would influence the two-hybrid activation. We performed Western blots with the GAD-Ace2 fusions, but none of the proteins were visible with either anti-GAD or anti-Ace2 antibodies (data not shown). Based on the results in Fig. 1F showing that Ace2 regions A/B are sufficient for interaction with LexA-Cbk1, we suggest that GAD-Ace2(A-B) may be much less stable than GAD-Ace2(A-B-C). Alternatively the addition of region C, characterized as an activation domain in Swi5-Ace2 chimeras, to the Cbk1-interacting regions A/B in GAD-Ace2(A-B-C) may confer additive transcriptional activation potential with the GAD domain.Ace2 Accumulates in the Nucleus after Swi5—ChIP experiments were performed to examine the timing of DNA binding by Ace2 and Swi5 within the cell cycle. Strains with either an Ace2-Myc tag or a Swi5-Myc tag were synchronized by a CDC20 arrest and release protocol (16Bhoite L.T. Yu Y. Stillman D.J.

This pathway involves detection of uncharged tRNA by the GCN2 kinase, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α), and, through subsequent translational control, enhanced de novo synthesis of the transcription factor ATF4. The present studies demonstrate that inhibition of MEK activation in HepG2 human hepatoma cells by PD98059 or U0126 blocked the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and ATF4 synthesis triggered by amino acid limitation, showing that the AAR requires activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. Inhibitors of the JNK or p38 MAPK pathways were ineffective. Consequently, inhibition of MEK activation blocked transcriptional induction of ATF4 target genes, but the induction was rescued by overexpression of ATF4 protein. Furthermore, the enhanced ERK phosphorylation following amino acid deprivation required GCN2 kinase activity and eIF2α phosphorylation. Inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 action on phospho-eIF2α by knockdown of GADD34 did not block the sensitivity to PD98059, suggesting that MEK functions to enhance GCN2-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation rather than suppressing dephosphorylation.

Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Without an adequate supply of essential amino acids, the binding of uncharged tRNA activates the GCN2 (general control nondeprepressible-2) kinase, which in turn, phosphorylates serine 51 of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2) (6Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The Ser-51-phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) functions as an inhibitor of eIF2B, which is responsible for the GDP-GTP exchange that regulates eIF2 activity; therefore, the resulting elevated level of p-eIF2α suppresses global translation initiation (6Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Ser-51 p-eIF2α is mediated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is targeted to p-eIF2α by interaction with the growth arrest and DNA damage gene GADD34 (7Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 8Brush M.H. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The PP1-GADD34 action on p-eIF2α is proposed to be a component of the program of recovery from the translational inhibition to allow for synthesis of stress-responsive proteins (9Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although eIF2α phosphorylation leads to a suppression of general protein synthesis, paradoxically, there is an increase in the synthesis of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) from preexisting mRNA through a mechanism based on ribosome scanning and reinitiation efficiency involving upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within the ATF4 mRNA (10Vattem K.M.

Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Among the ATF4-responsive, AARE-containing genes is SNAT2 (System A neutral amino acid transporter) (13Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem.

Cells also sense and respond to their environment via the activation of other protein kinase cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In mammalian cells, there are three major MAPK cascades, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 MAPK. The ERK pathway involves the sequential activation of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma protein (Raf), MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and ERK kinases (16Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Amino acid depletion has been shown to activate Raf-1 activity by causing hypophosphorylation at Ser-259 by protein phosphatase 2A (17Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N.

The enhanced Raf-1 kinase activity triggers the MEK/ERK signaling cascade, which in turn stimulates autophagy in an amino acid-dependent manner via a Gα-interacting protein that regulates the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαi3 protein (17Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol.

A potential direct link between the MEK/ERK pathway and the eIF2α-ATF4 transcription signaling cascade has not been well documented, and the purpose of the present work was to investigate this possibility. Only one previous report has provided evidence for a relationship between the ERK and eIF2α phosphorylation. Monick et al. (20Monick M.M. Powers L.S. Gross T.J. Flaherty D.M. Barrett C.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that alveolar macrophages are different from most cells in that they exhibit a constitutively high ERK activity, which promotes hypophosphorylation of eIF2α by enhancing the action of PP1 and, in this way, promoting general protein synthesis. The authors of that study propose that this unique elevation of translation accounts for the prolonged life span of alveolar macrophages despite being exposed to a wide range of environmental stresses. Depending on the tissue or cell type, the enhanced expression of particular cellular functions following amino acid deprivation has been shown to be dependent on one or more of the MAPK pathways. For example, Franchi-Gazzola et al. (21Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Bussolati O. Dall'Asta V. Gazzola G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28922-28928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) showed that after complete amino acid starvation, the adaptive increase in System A transport activity was blocked by the MEK activation inhibitor PD98059. At the time of those studies, the three SNAT genes that encode System A transport activity were not yet identified, so the molecular basis for MEK action in the induction of System A transport activity was not known. It was later shown that the SNAT2 gene encoded the amino acid-regulated System A activity (22Gazzola R.F. Sala R. Bussolati O. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Ganapathy V. Gazzola G.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Palii S.S. Leach K.M. Kilberg M.S. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and our laboratory has documented that the SNAT2 gene contains an ATF4-responsive AARE within the first intron (13Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consequently, induction of SNAT2 expression in response to amino acid limitation is dependent on eIF2α phosphorylation and the subsequent synthesis of ATF4 (15Gaccioli F. Huang C.C. Wang C. Bevilacqua E. Franchi-Gazzola R. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17929-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our present data, collected in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, demonstrate an interdependent relationship between activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and eIF2α phosphorylation during nutrient stress. The results document that, following amino acid deprivation, MEK and ERK are activated, as revealed by increased ERK phosphorylation, and this activation required GCN2 kinase activity. Using agents that prevent MEK activation, the phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser-51 by GCN2 and the subsequent production of the transcription factor ATF4 was observed to be dependent on MEK/ERK activation. Inhibition of eIF2α phosphatase activity by siRNA against GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 34) did not alter the sensitivity to MEK inhibition, indicating that MEK functions to enhance GCN2-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation rather than to suppress the dephosphorylation step. Consistent with a requirement for enhanced MEK activity within the AAR pathway, the loss of transcriptional signaling due to MEK blockade could be rescued by expression of exogenous ATF4. Therefore, the data show that MEK is activated by a GCN2-dependent process and that there is an absolute requirement for MEK/ERK signaling upstream of eIF2α-mediated translational control in the mammalian AAR pathway. Inhibitors and Antibodies—The β-actin antibody (catalog number A2066) and the following inhibitors were purchased from Sigma: MEK inhibitor U0126, p38 inhibitor SB203580, MEK inhibitor PD98059, and JNK inhibitor SP600125. Antibodies to ATF4 (catalog number sc-200), total ERK (catalog number sc-94), and p-ERK (catalog number sc-7383) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to eIF2α (catalog number 9722) and p-eIF2α at Ser-51 (catalog number 9721) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Cell Culture—HepG2 human hepatoma cells were cultured in modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), pH 7.4 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 1× nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild type and GCN2 knock-out mice that had been immortalized by SV40 were generously supplied by Drs. Heather Harding and David Ron (24Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). MEF cells isolated from C57B16 mice expressing the wild type eIF2α (S/S) or a knock-in cell line expressing the S51A mutation (eIF2α-A/A) that had been immortalized spontaneously (25Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with glutamine (Mediatech), supplemented with 1× nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. At 12 h prior to initiating all treatments, cells were given fresh medium and serum to ensure that no nutrient deprivation took place prior to the start of experimental incubations. For amino acid deprivation in the presence of kinase inhibitors (50 μm PD98059 (MEK), 10 μm U0126 (MEK), 10 μm SB203580 (P38), or 20 μm SB600125 (JNK)), cells were pretreated with the specified inhibitor in complete MEM conditions for 1 h and then incubated with the inhibitor in complete MEM or MEM minus histidine, each containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Steady State mRNA Analysis—Total mRNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit with on-column DNase treatment to eliminate any trace amounts of DNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To measure the steady state ATF4, SNAT2, or GADD34 mRNA, quantitative real time PCR was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green chemistry. RNA reaction mixtures were incubated at 48 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 15 min and amplification of 35 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and then 60 °C for 60 s. To establish that a single product was amplified during the reaction, melting curves were generated for each reaction by a stepwise increase of the temperature from 55 to 95 °C, and measurements were taken at every degree change. Reactions were also run without reverse transcriptase to ensure that there was no DNA amplification. The primers used for ATF4 mRNA amplification were as follows: sense primer, 5′-TGAAGGAGTTCGACTTGGATGCC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CAGAAGGTCATCTGGCATGGTTTC-3′. The primers used for GADD34 mRNA amplification were as follows: sense primer, 5′-CACTCCTGCTACAGGTGTCT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TCGGCTGATCCTGTATCA-3′. The primers used to assay steady state SNAT2 mRNA or to measure transcription activity from the SNAT2 gene by assaying hnRNA amplification were reported previously (14Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The primers used to measure ERK1 steady state mRNA were as follows: sense primer, 5′-GCGCTACACGCAGTTGCAGTACA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TGATGGCCACGCGAGTCTTG-3′. For ERK2, the primers were as follows: sense primer, 5′-CGCCGAAGCACCATTCAAGTT-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-TCCTGGCTGGAATCTAGCAGTCTCT-3′. Protein Isolation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein extracts were isolated in sample dilution buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry method (26Kilberg M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 564-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, 30 μg of protein/lane was loaded onto Bio-Rad Precast Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were stained with Fast Green to ensure equal loading and then blocked with 5% blocking solution (5% (w/v) Carnation nonfat dry milk, 30 mm Tris-base, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. Each primary antibody was used at a dilution between 1:500 and 1:1000 (v/v) in 5% blocking solution and incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C or for 4 h at room temperature. The blots were washed five times for 5 min each in 1% blocking solution and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody at a 1:5,000 to 1:20,000 dilution (v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed for 5 × 5 min in 1% blocking solution and 2 × 5 min in freshly made TBS/Tween (30 mm Tris-base, 0.1% Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing the blot to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). DNA Affinity Purification Assay—HepG2 nuclear extracts were isolated as described previously (27Leung-Pineda V. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Annealing complementary 5′-biotinylated DNA strands at a concentration of 1 μg/μl generated a 29-bp double-stranded DNA probe (5′-GACGATCGATATTGCATCAGTTTTCTTTC-3′) containing an AARE (underlined). PBS was used to wash a 4% slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma), and then 500 μg of HepG2 nuclear extract plus 5 μg of biotinylated probe was added to the bead slurry. The total volume was adjusted to 500 μl with PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (27Leung-Pineda V. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed four times for 5 min each with cold PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer, and then boiled for 5 min to elute the bound protein. A 25-50-μl aliquot was loaded onto Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then immunoblotted according to the protocol above. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—HepG2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well and grown for 24 h prior to transfection. As described previously (14Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Superfect (Qiagen) was used to transfect cells with either 1 μg of pGL3 Firefly luciferase reporter plasmid encoding the AARE-containing SNAT2 genomic region (nucleotides -512 to +770) alone or in combination with 100 ng of pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the cDNA for ATF4 driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The ATF4 cDNA lacks the upstream open reading frame that renders the native mRNA subject to translational control. Consequently, the ATF4 protein is produced constitutively from this construct. For all wells, total DNA concentration was kept constant at 1.1 μg by adding empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid to the transfection complex. Cells were transfected for 3 h, given fresh MEM for ∼18 h, and incubated for 8 h in MEM, MEM plus PD98059, MEM minus histidine, or MEM minus histidine plus PD98059. Firefly luciferase activities were measured using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Total protein, measured for each well, was used to normalize data between replicate wells. The data are presented as the averages ± S.D. of at least four determinations. To investigate the role of MEK activity on ATF4 translation per se, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected, using the Superfect protocol described above, with 1 μg of either a wild type ATF4-luciferase fusion construct or a uORF1 and uORF2 doubly mutated ATF4-luciferase fusion construct, both created by the laboratory of Dr. Ron Wek (10Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Cells were also transfected with 0.5 ng of an SV40 promoter-driven Renilla construct as a transfection control. Cells were incubated in either control or histidine-depleted medium with or without 50 μm PD98059 for 4 h, and then Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). To test whether or not MEK or ERK modulated eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser-51, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected, using calcium phosphate (14Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), with cDNA constructs containing the coding regions for a constitutively active MEK, wild type eIF2α, or a mutant eIF2α lacking the serine 51 phosphorylation site (S51A). At 36 h after transfection, whole cell extracts were immunoblotted for total eIF2α protein, p-eIF2α, or actin. Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—The human PPP1R15A (GADD34) siRNA (catalog number D-004442-02), siControl nontargeting siRNA (catalog number D-001210-02), and DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). HepG2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in MEM and grown for 16 h. Transfection was performed according to the instructions of Dharmacon using 3 μl of DharmaFECT-4 and a 100 nm per well final siRNA concentration. HepG2 cells were treated with transfection reagent for 24 h and then rinsed with PBS, given fresh MEM, and cultured for another 24 h. The medium was then removed and replaced with control MEM or MEM lacking histidine, with or without 50 μm PD98059. Total RNA and protein extracts were isolated at specific times and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR or immunoblotting, respectively. Inhibition of MEK Activation Blocks the Induction of an AARE-containing Gene and the in Vitro Binding of ATF4 to an AARE—Franchi-Gazzola et al. (21Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Bussolati O. Dall'Asta V. Gazzola G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28922-28928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) showed that the increased System A amino acid transport activity that occurs following amino acid deprivation is blocked by inhibition of MEK activation using the inhibitor PD98059. Subsequently, amino acid-regulated System A activity was established to result from increased transcription from the SNAT2 gene (22Gazzola R.F. Sala R. Bussolati O. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Ganapathy V. Gazzola G.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Palii S.S. Leach K.M. Kilberg M.S. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has documented previously that histidine deprivation of HepG2 cells causes increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is completely blocked by PD98059 (28Leung-Pineda V. Pan Y. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, when HepG2 cells were deprived for histidine in the presence of PD98059 (labeled -MEK), the increase in SNAT2 mRNA content was completely blocked (Fig. 1A). An inhibitory effect of PD98059 was also observed for transcriptional induction of another amino acid-regulated gene, asparagine synthetase (data not shown). The induction of transcription from these AARE-containing genes following amino acid limitation coincides with the increase in ATF4 protein production (29Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of ATF4 increases transcription from a SNAT2-driven reporter gene, and by both in vivo and in vitro techniques, it has been documented that ATF4 binds to the AARE within intron I of the SNAT2 gene (14Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consequently, the effect of MEK inhibition on nuclear ATF4 binding activity was monitored (Fig. 1B). A DNA affinity purification assay was performed using an AARE-containing DNA probe that was incubated with nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells that had been incubated for 8 h in either complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine. The amount of ATF4 binding activity was considerably greater in the extracts from amino acid-depleted cells compared with those from MEM-incubated control cells (Fig. 1B). However, when the histidine-deprived cells were simultaneously treated with the MEK inhibitor, the increase in nuclear ATF4 binding activity was completely blocked. The Effect of MAP Kinase Inhibitors on ATF4 mRNA and Protein Levels during Amino Acid Limitation—In addition to enhanced ATF4 translation, there is also an increase in ATF4 mRNA content following amino acid deprivation (30Siu F. Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24120-24127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the effect of MEK activity on ATF4 mRNA and protein expression during histidine deprivation, HepG2 cells were treated with PD98059 (-MEK), as well as with selective inhibitors for either p38 (-p38) or JNK (-JNK) (Fig. 2). The p38 and JNK inhibitors did not prevent the induction of ATF4 mRNA levels, although blocking JNK activity actually elevated the basal levels of ATF4 mRNA (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the inhibitor of MEK/ERK signaling, PD98059, completely prevented the increase in ATF4 mRNA. As discussed above, although transcription from the ATF4 gene is increased, the primary mode of increasing ATF4 protein expression following amino acid deprivation is enhanced translation of preexisting ATF4 mRNA (10Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 11Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), so the increase in ATF4 protein content was also measured in the presence of the MAPK inhibitors (Fig. 2B). The p38 inhibitor had no effect on the amino acid deprivation-induced increase in ATF4 protein levels, but once again, inhibition of MEK blocked the enhancement. Interestingly, inhibition of JNK caused an enhanced ATF4 level, even in the basal (complete MEM) condition. De novo synthesis results in a detectable increase in HepG2 ATF4 protein levels after 1-2 h of histidine deprivation and a peak of accumulation around 4 h (29Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Given that the initial MAPK pathway screening shown in Fig. 2 was conducted at a single treatment time of 8 h, a time course of ATF4 synthesis with or without PD98059 treatment was investigated (Fig. 3A). As expected, the ATF4 content of control cells increased at 2 h after histidine withdrawal, with a maximum level attained by 4 h. However, the cells treated with PD98059 (-MEK) showed a complete block of ATF4 protein accumulation at all time points. As mentioned above, the translation of preexisting ATF4 mRNA is enhanced following amino acid limitation, because increased phosphorylation of eIF2α favors translation initiation at the ATF4 coding sequence rather than at an out-of-frame uORF (10Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 11Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). To determine if the translation of ATF4 was directly blocked by inhibition of MEK activity, cells were transfected with an ATF4-Firefly luciferase construct containing the wild type ATF4 uORFs or mutations within the uORFs"

Because amphipathic α-helices are the structural determinants for ABCA1 interactions, we examined the ability of synthetic peptides corresponding to helices in PLTP to remove cellular cholesterol by the ABCA1 pathway. Of the seven helices tested, only one containing PLTP residues 144–163 (p144), located at the tip of the N-terminal barrel, promoted ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and stabilized ABCA1 protein. Mutating methionine 159 (Met-159) in this helix in PLTP to aspartate (M159D) or glutamate (M159E) nearly abolished the ability of PLTP to remove cellular cholesterol and dramatically reduced PLTP binding to phospholipid vesicles and its phospholipid transfer activity. These mutations impaired PLTP binding to ABCA1-generated lipid domains and PLTP-mediated stabilization of ABCA1 but increased PLTP binding to ABCA1. PLTP interactions with ABCA1 also mimicked apolipoproteins in activating Janus kinase 2; however, the M159D/E mutants were also able to activate this kinase. Structural analyses showed that the M159D/E mutations had only minor effects on PLTP conformation. These findings indicate that PLTP helix 144–163 is critical for removing lipid domains formed by ABCA1, stabilizing ABCA1 protein, interacting with phospholipids, and promoting phospholipid transfer.

Little is known, however, about the interactions of PLTP with peripheral cells and its effects on cellular lipid metabolism. One possible function of peripheral PLTP is to transport lipids from cells to lipoproteins. An important mediator of lipid export from cells is ATP-binding cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA1), a membrane protein that transports cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to HDL apolipoproteins, such as apoA-I (12Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1343-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Human and mouse model studies have shown that ABCA1 is cardioprotective (13Singaraja R.R. Brunham L.R.

The observation that PLTP mimics apolipoproteins in binding to ABCA1 and removing cellular lipids implies that PLTP and apolipoproteins share structural features that mediate ABCA1 interactions.

Although PLTP does not have structural elements homologous to those in apolipoproteins, it is predicted to contain seven amphipathic helical domains. In the current study, we used synthetic peptides and PLTP mutants to identify a phospholipid-binding helical region near the tip of the N-terminal barrel of PLTP that is critical for promoting ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and stabilizing ABCA1 protein. These studies provide further insight into the structural properties of proteins that play a role in the ABCA1 lipid export pathway.

ABCA1 protein levels were quantified using OptiQuant computer software (Packard Instruments). Cellular contents of JAK2 and phosphorylated JAK2 were measured by immunoblot analyses using antibodies to JAK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 (BIOSOURCE International) (29Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 279: 7622-7628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of membrane or cell protein were added per gel lane. Lipid Binding—The propensity for lipid association was measured using the biotin-capture lipid affinity (BCLA) assay as detailed previously (38Davidson W.S. Ghering A.B. Beish L. Tubb M.R. Hui D.Y. Pearson K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 440-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, a constant mass of small unilamellar POPC vesicles (SUVs) containing small amounts of biotinylated lipid and fluorescently labeled lipid were mixed with increasing amounts of apolipoprotein in a microplate setup. After binding reached equilibrium, vesicle-bound protein was separated from unbound protein in a 96-well streptavidin column plate. PLTP Phospholipid Transfer Activity—The indicated amounts of PLTP were assayed at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for their ability to transfer 14C-labeled phospholipid from donor liposome particles to acceptor HDL3 particles (39Cheung M.C. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 20 min, the reaction was stopped by immersion of the tubes into ice water; 500 μl of 2% outdated plasma were added, and donor particles were precipitated with 100 μl of dextran sulfate/magnesium chloride for 30 min and separated from acceptor substrate by centrifugation (40Warnick G.R. Benderson J. Albers J.J. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the supernatant was measured and corrected for the background transfer, and phospholipid transfer activity was expressed as percent phospholipid transferred per aliquot PLTP per 20 min. PLTP Cross-linking—To determine the degree of self-association of PLTP in solution, chemical cross-linking was performed using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) as described (40Warnick G.R. Benderson J. Albers J.J. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). Briefly, PLTP in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of about 1.0 mg/ml was treated with a final concentration of 0.2 or 0.5 mm cross-linker. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 6 h, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of one-sixth volume of 50 mm ethanolamine in PBS. The samples were then run on 8–25% SDS-PAGE gels and compared with noncross-linked PLTP and molecular weight standards. Circular Dichroism—PLTP samples were freshly dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4). Proteins were then diluted to 100 μg/ml, and spectra were collected on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in a 1-mm cell as an average of four scans. The scans were from 260 to 190 nm at 50 nm/min with a 0.5-nm step size and 0.5-s response. Bandwidth was set to 1 mm and the slit width was 500 μm. To confirm the accuracy of dilution, protein concentration was verified by A280 on the diluted samples. Mean residual ellipticity (MRE) was calculated as described by Woody (41Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) using 111.0 Da as the mean residual weight for PLTP. The fractional helical content was calculated using the formula of Chen et al. (42Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar) and the MRE at 222 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times with a similar pattern observed consistently. Tryptophan Fluorescence—PLTP samples prepared for the circular dichroism analysis were subjected to fluorescence excitation at 295 nm in a Photon Technology International Quantamaster fluorescent spectrophotometer, and emission was scanned from 300–380 nm in a 0.5-cm cuvette at room temperature. The spectra from samples were corrected for buffer blanks. The wavelength of maximum fluorescence was determined at the highest value of detector counts in the scan range. Each sample was scanned three times with 2 min of dark time between scans to prevent photobleaching. We showed previously that PLTP can mimic HDL apolipoproteins in binding to ABCA1, removing cellular cholesterol and phospholipids, and stabilizing ABCA1 protein. This implies that PLTP and apolipoproteins share structural features that mediate ABCA1 interactions. Studies of small apolipoprotein-mimetic peptides have shown that the major structural determinant for binding ABCA1 and removing lipids is the amphipathic α-helix (26Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A structural model of PLTP has been formulated from x-ray crystallography of a close PLTP homolog, bactericidal permeability increasing protein, and from sequence alignments with other members of this transfer protein family (44Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model predicts that PLTP forms two barrel-shaped domains linked by a β-sheeted interface (Fig. 1A). Each barrel contains two amphipathic helical regions proximal to the interface and one near the barrel tip, with an additional helix extending from the interface. The two medial helices in each barrel form hydrophobic pockets that bind phospholipid molecules. We synthesized peptides corresponding to each of these seven helices (Table 1, denoted by the location of their N-terminal amino acids) and tested them for their abilities to promote [3H]cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-transfected BHK cells. Of these peptides, only p144 had any substantial ability to promote ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, and this was comparable to that observed with full-length PLTP (Fig. 2A). The effects of p144 were concentration-dependent and saturated at ∼10 μg/ml (Fig. 2B). This saturable component was markedly reduced in mock-transfected cells that lack ABCA1. The ABCA1 protein is highly unstable in cultured macrophages (half-life ∼ 1.5 h) and is rapidly degraded when cells which are first incubated with an ABCA1 inducer, such as 8-Br-cAMP, are subsequently incubated without inducer (35Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins or their small mimetic peptides stabilize ABCA1 protein by inhibiting its proteolysis (29Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 43Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 45Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the PLTP helical peptides for their abilities to stabilize ABCA1 protein. When J774 macrophages were first incubated with 8-Br-cAMP to induce ABCA1 to high levels and subsequently incubated with medium lacking this cAMP analog, ABCA1 almost completely disappeared after 4 h (Fig. 3A, left lane). Adding apoA-I to this chase medium prevented this disappearance. As with cholesterol efflux, the only PLTP peptide that stabilized ABCA1 significantly was p144 (Fig. 3A). Thus, this peptide mimics apolipoproteins and PLTP in both promoting cholesterol efflux and stabilizing the ABCA1 protein. The sequence of p144 predicts that it is a highly hydrophobic amphipathic helix with a broad non-polar face rich in phenylalanines and a narrow polar face containing only 4 charged residues (Fig. 1C). To determine if this helix in intact PLTP plays a role in removing cholesterol from cells by the ABCA1 pathway, we prepared PLTP mutants with amino acid substitutions in the 144–163 region of PLTP. The K146L mutant has the hydrophobic amino acid leucine substituted for the positively charged lysine located at the polar and non-polar helical interface and near the tip of the N-terminal barrel (Fig. 1, B and C). The M159D and M159E mutants have the negatively charged aspartate or glutamate substituted for the lipophilic methionine residue located at the polar and non-polar helical interface (Fig. 1C) and oriented into the chamber of the N-terminal barrel (Fig. 1B). The purpose of these mutations was to change the charge or hydrophobicity at the polar/non-polar interface of the helix and to substitute charged residues for a methionine that may affect lipid interactions in the barrel. When incubated with ABCA1-transfected BHK cells, PLTP with the K146L mutation had only a slightly reduced cholesterol efflux activity compared with wild type PLTP, but the M159D and M159E mutants were almost completely inactive (Fig. 4A). A similar pattern was observed when HDL was included in the medium (Fig. 4B). Thus, substituting a negatively charged amino acid for the methionine in the 144–163 helix of PLTP nearly abolished ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux activity. We also examined the effects of these mutations on the ability of PLTP to stabilize ABCA1 protein in J774 macrophages. As we also reported previously (15Oram J.F. Wolfbauer G. Vaughan A.M. Tang C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52379-52385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the disappearance of the ABCA1 protein following cAMP removal was overcome in the presence of either apoA-I or wild-type PLTP (Fig. 3B). The K146L mutation had little effect on the ABCA1-stabilizing effect of PLTP, but both the M159E and M159D mutations abolished it. These results show that substituting an acidic residue for the methionine in helix 144–163 severely impairs the ability of PLTP to both promote ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and stabilize ABCA1 protein. We showed previously that PLTP can be chemically cross-linked to ABCA1 (15Oram J.F. Wolfbauer G. Vaughan A.M. Tang C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52379-52385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), consistent with a direct interaction between these two proteins. To determine if the mutations in helix 144–163 affect the binding of PLTP to ABCA1, we incubated mock- and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells with wild-type and mutant 125I-PLTP, treated cells with the cross-linking agent DSP, immunoprecipitated ABCA1 from detergent-solubilized cells, and identified recovered 125I-PLTP by SDS-PAGE. Results from two independent experiments with different 125I-PLTP samples showed that PLTP was recovered in the immunoprecipitates from ABCA1-transfected cells but not from cells lacking ABCA1 (Fig. 5A), consistent with PLTP binding to ABCA1. The K146L mutation had little effect on this recovery, but the M159E and M159D mutations actually increased the recovery of 125I-PLTP. Quantifying band intensity from the two experiments showed that the ratio of mutant to wild-type PLTP was 1.2, 2.4, and 2.6 for the K146L, M159E, and M159D mutants, respectively. Thus, while the K146L had little effect, the substitution of acidic amino acids for the methionine in this helix more than doubled the amount of PLTP bound to ABCA1. We also found that wild-type and each PLTP mutant could compete for cross-linking of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 (not shown). The interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 elicits intracellular signals, including autophosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) (29Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Oram J.F. J.

RhoA was previously implicated in mediating the expression of CCN2/CTGF. We now present evidence that Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 are the principal mediators of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1)-stimulated expression of CCN2/CTGF in primary human gingival fibroblasts. TGFβ1 does not stimulate RhoA activation in gingival fibroblasts, and the overexpression of dominant-negative RhoA does not reduce CCN2/CTGF expression in response to TGFβ1. In contrast, the overexpression of dominant-negative forms of Cdc42 or Rac1 results in a dramatic reduction of CCN2/CTGF protein levels. Lovastatin and a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor reduce the TGFβ1-stimulated levels of CCN2/CTGF protein by ∼75 and 100%, respectively. We previously demonstrated that JNK1 phosphorylation by TGFβ1 is also critical for TGFβ1-induced CCN2/CTGF expression, and forskolin partially reduces levels of phosphorylated JNK1. Inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase has no effect on levels of JNK phosphorylation in response to TGFβ1 suggesting Rho-GTPases act independently of JNK1. The combination of lovastatin and forskolin results in a greater inhibitory effect than each agent alone and reduces CCN2/CTGF mRNA and protein expression by greater than 90%. This novel combination has additive inhibitory effects on the TGFβ1-stimulated expression of CCN2/CTGF in human gingival fibroblasts through the simultaneous disruption of Rho- and JNK1-mediated pathways, respectively. This combination of available therapeutic compounds may therefore be useful in designing treatment strategies for oral fibrotic conditions in which gingival CCN2/CTGF is elevated.

Tissues derived from these patients contain a high level of CCN2/CTGF expression and are more fibrotic compared with other forms of drug-induced gingival overgrowth, which do not overexpress CCN2/CTGF (31Uzel M.I.

We therefore consider CCN2/CTGF to be a potential therapeutic target for designing treatment alternatives against the onset and progression of phenytoin-induced and hereditary forms of gingival overgrowth. Because patients taking the anti-convulsive agent, phenytoin, may not be able to discontinue medication, the indicated treatment for gingival overgrowth tissues is the repeated, painful surgical excision of the fibrotic tissue. A less traumatic mode of intervention is needed.It has been reported that the re-growth of fibrotic gingival tissues in these patients is rapid following surgery (32Hall E.E. Curr. Opin.

The standard surgical excision of gingival tissues in patients with hereditary or phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth results in the recruitment of platelets and normal clotting factors early in the post-surgical healing processes. A potential mechanism for the rapid re-growth of gingival tissues is the early recruitment of platelets to the wound. Platelets are rich in LPA and also carry CCN2/CTGF protein (35Gerrard J.M.

In this study we investigate the mechanism of LPA and TGF-β1 stimulation of CCN2/CTGF in primary cultures of gingival fibroblasts and identify additive effects and unique signaling pathways that mediate their effects.Primary human gingival fibroblasts are unique in their resistance to the inhibition of the TGFβ1-induced expression of CCN2/CTGF by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), whereas in primary human renal mesangial cells and IMR90 human lung fibroblasts PGE2 potently blocks CCN2/CTGF expression stimulated by TGFβ1 (40Black Jr., S.A.

Although it has been demonstrated that renal fibroblasts require activated RhoA to promote CCN2/CTGF expression in response to LPA and TGFβ (8Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M. Wahab N.A. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eberlein M. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Goppelt-Struebe M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the role of the Rho family GTPases in mediating the TGFβ1-stimulated expression of CCN2/CTGF has yet to be determined in gingival cells. Here we demonstrate that the Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, and not RhoA, are essential mediators in the TGFβ1-stimulated expression of CCN2/CTGF in primary human gingival fibroblasts. These findings demonstrate another novel aspect of the cell/tissue-specific differences between human fibroblastic cell types in regulating CCN2/CTGF expression. Data presented provide potentially useful information that may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies designed to minimize fibrosis caused by the overexpression of CCN2/CTGF in forms of oral tissue overgrowth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Forskolin, H89, and mevalonolactone were obtained from Sigma. PGE2, mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody, Y27632, geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI), farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), lovastatin-sodium and simvastatin-sodium were obtained from Calbiochem; recombinant adenovirus, adenoviral titer kit, and β-galactosidase staining kit were from CellBiolabs; LPA was from Avanti Polar Lipids; the exotoxin C3-ADP-ribosyltransferase of Clostridium botulinum was from Cytoskeleton, Inc.; Chariot protein delivery reagent was acquired from Active Motif; RNeasy mini-RNA purification kits were purchased from Qiagen; TGFβ1 was from PeproTech; rabbit anti-human CCN2/CTGF polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by FibroGen Corp., South San Francisco, CA; LumiGLO chemiluminescent detection system, rabbit anti-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) antibodies against phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183, Tyr-184; catalog number 9251), total stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (catalog number 9252), and secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Inc.; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phosphate-buffered saline, trypsin, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) were from Invitrogen; all solutions, Taqman probes, and instruments for real time qPCR were obtained from Applied Biosystems; 100-mm and 6-well cell culture plates were from Fisher; Restore Western blot Stripping Solution and nuclear extraction kits were from Pierce.Cell Culture—Primary human gingival fibroblasts were obtained from donors from the Clinical Research Center, Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine, as described previously (41Essig M. Vrtovsnik F. Nguyen G. Sraer J.D. Friedlander G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gingival fibroblasts from two different adult donors were used, and data obtained were reproducible. Data shown are from one donor (HCT-11). Fibroblasts from all tissues were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a fully humidified incubator in 100-mm cell culture dishes. Cells were grown to 80% confluence and then placed in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for a minimum of 12 h prior to treatment. Specified inhibitors were next added in serum-free bovine serum albumin medium for 30 or 60 min prior to the addition of TGF-β1 or vehicle. TGF-β1 treatments were generally for either 4 h for RNA analyses or 6 h for protein analyses, based on previous studies. Cells were not passed beyond four passages.Cultures of gingival fibroblasts were treated with simvastatin, lovastatin, GGTI, or FTI for 12 h prior to treatment with TGFβ1. Cultures were then incubated for an additional 6 h prior to harvest of total cell layer protein to assess CCN2/CTGF protein expression via Western blot. Mevalonolactone (Sigma) hydrolysis to mevalonate salt was accomplished according to protocols described previously (41Essig M. Vrtovsnik F. Nguyen G. Sraer J.D. Friedlander G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mevalonolactone was incubated in 0.1 n NaOH, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 50 °C. Aliquots of 0.1 m mevalonate salt solution were then stored at -20 °C until required. In experiments involving the C3 exotoxin of C. botulinum, the C3-mediated inhibition of Rho-GTPases, gingival fibroblast cultures were transfected with 5 μg/ml C3 using the Chariot protein transfection reagent. Transfection complexes were added to cultures and incubated for 12 h prior to the introduction of TGFβ1. Cultures were incubated for an additional 6 h prior to harvest of total cell layer protein for Western blot analysis.Real Time Quantitative PCR (qPCR)—Total RNA was obtained using RNeasy Midi columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was isolated from fibroblast cell cultures and purified using RNeasy mini-RNA purification kits (Qiagen). RNA obtained was run on a 1% agarose gel to ensure RNA quality by analyzing for the presence of 18 S and 28 S rRNA in proper relative proportions. RNA was quantified via spectrophotometry, and 1 μg of RNA per treatment condition was added to 30 μl of reverse transcription reactions using random primers and the Applied Biosystems reverse transcription kit. Thermal cycler conditions for reverse transcription were 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 60 min, and 95 °C for 5 min, and cDNA was stored at -20 °C prior to use in real time PCR. Four microliters of each reverse transcription reaction was used for 50-μl real time PCRs using the traditional 96-well format. Taqman probes for human CCN2/CTGF (catalog number Hs00170014_m1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (catalog number Hs99999905_m1) were used in real time PCR analyses. Real time PCRs were run in an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp Prism 7700 system at thermal cycler conditions of 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Data were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔct method, and CCN2/CTGF mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and no treatment controls.Western Blot Analysis—Fibroblast cell cultures were grown as described above, and total cell layer protein was harvested by dissolving cell layers in 500 μl of sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol per 100-mm culture dish. Samples were then boiled for 5 min and stored at -80 °C. Samples were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies specific for protein of interest. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight at 4 °C in blotting buffer containing 0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, and 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween) for 1 h followed by the addition of specific primary rabbit antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C with mild shaking. Membranes were then washed with TBST 5 times for 10 min each. Membranes were next incubated with secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies in 5% milk and TBST for 2 h at room temperature with mild shaking. Membranes were washed with TBST five times for 5 min each. Chemiluminescent detection of bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies was determined using the LumiGlo/peroxide (Cell Signaling) and exposed to film. Membranes were subsequently stripped using Restore Western Stripping Solution and re-probed for loading controls as required. Densitometric analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad VersaDoc 3000 Imaging System.Extraction of Nuclear Proteins—Nuclei were collected, and nuclear lysates were purified using the nuclear extract kit from Active Motif with strict adherence to the manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, cultures of primary human gingival fibroblasts were grown to near confluence and serum-starved for 12 h and then treated with 10 μm LPA and/or 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 for the times indicated. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing the phosphatase mixture provided and then scraped and collected in the same buffer. Detached cells were spun at 500 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. Hypotonic buffer (1×) was added to the pellets and incubated on ice for 15 min. Detergent was added, and the cells were vortexed for 10 s and then centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was saved, and Complete Lysis Buffer was added to each pellet and vortexed for 10 s. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min while rocking, vortexed for 30 s, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant (nuclear fraction) was saved and stored at -80 °C.Recombinant Adenovirus Dominant-negative Studies—Gingival fibroblasts were grown in 12-well plates to 80% confluence. Adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase was used as the control for assessment of the level of infection and gene expression in our cells. Different dominant-negative adenoviral constructs (1010 infectious units/ml) were introduced, and cultures were grown for 48 h to permit expression of virus-encoded genes. At this concentration we achieved 100% infection of gingival fibroblast cultures as determined by β-galactosidase staining. Forty eight hours post-infection, TGFβ1 was added, and cultures were incubated for times indicated prior to harvest of total cell layer protein for Western blot analysis. β-Galactosidase staining and estimated viral titer was conducted according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Recombinant adenovirus expressing the dominant-negative forms of the following were used in our experiments and were purchased from Cell Biolabs, Inc.; Cdc42 (N17, catalog number ADV-153), RhoA (N19, catalog number ADV-156), Ras (N17, catalog number ADV-145), and Rac1 (N17, catalog number ADV-150).RhoA Activation Assay—The presence of activated RhoA was determined in response to various stimuli using the EZ-detect RhoA activation kit from Pierce. Briefly, 100-mm plates of gingival fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluence and serum-starved for 12 h. Two culture plates were then treated with the indicated concentrations of TGFβ1, LPA, PGE2, or forskolin for 3 min. Cells were then lysed with 500 μl of lysis/binding/wash buffer, and lysates were transferred to a labeled microcentrifuge tube and briefly vortexed. Lysates were incubated on ice for 5-min then microcentrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored on ice in a fresh microcentrifuge tube. 400 μg of GST-Rhotekin-RBD was added to individual spin columns, and 700 μl of sample lysate was added to each column and briefly vortexed. Binding was permitted to continue for 1 h at 4 °C. Spin columns were then microcentrifuged at 7,200 × g for 30 s, and resin was washed three times with 400 μl of kit wash buffer. Fifty microliters of sample buffer (see under “Western Blot Analysis”) was then added to each column, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Finally, columns were microcentrifuged at 7,200 × g for 2 min, and flow-through was stored at -20 °C and then subjected to 2% SDS-PAGE for analysis of activated/bound RhoA. Lysates treated with GTPγSor GDP were used as positive and negative controls of RhoA activation, respectively.C3/Chariot Transfection Study—Cell cultures of primary gingival fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluence. Each culture was treated with the Chariot small protein transfection reagent as described in the manufacturer's guidelines (Active Motif) combined with 5 μg of purified C3 exotransferase from C. botulinum (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Negative and positive (TGFβ1 alone) control cultures were mock-transfected with Chariot without the addition of C3. Cultures were transfected using Chariot/C3 for 12 h in the presence of serum-free medium. Culture media were then removed and replaced with media supplemented with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 and incubated for an additional 6 h prior to harvest of total cellular protein to be used for Western blot analysis of CCN2/CTGF protein expression.RESULTSKinetics of CCN2/CTGF mRNA and Protein Expression Differ in Response to TGFβ1 and LPA in Human Gingival Fibroblasts—In human renal fibroblasts and mesangial cells, 10 μm LPA induces CCN2/CTGF mRNA expression more than TGFβ1 (8Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M. Wahab N.A. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eberlein M. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Goppelt-Struebe M. Br. J.

Pathol. 2001; 54: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because the regulation of CCN2/CTGF differs between human renal and gingival fibroblasts (40Black Jr., S.A. Palamakumbura A.H. Stan M. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15416-15429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we wished to determine and compare the kinetics of CCN2/CTGF expression in response to TGFβ1 and LPA in primary gingival fibroblasts. Primary human gingival fibroblast cultures were grown to 80% confluence and serum-starved for 12 h. Cultures were then treated with either 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 or 10 μm LPA for 4 h prior to harvest of total RNA or 6 h prior to harvest of total cell layer protein.Data indicate that the expression of both CCN2/CTGF mRNA and protein increases gradually after treatment with TGFβ1 (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, stimulation with LPA produced a rapid increase in CCN2/CTGF mRNA 2 h after treatment, which rapidly returned to nearly unstimulated levels by 6 h (Fig. 1A). The LPA-induced expression of CCN2/CTGF protein remained elevated 6 h after treatment (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the effect of the combined treatment of TGFβ1 and LPA appears to increase CCN2/CTGF protein levels above LPA or TGFβ1 alone (Fig. 1B).TGFβ1 and LPA Stimulate Similar Levels of JNK1 Phosphorylation in Human Gingival Fibroblasts—We previously demonstrated that JNK1 phosphorylation induced by TGFβ1 is essential for maximal CCN2/CTGF expression (40Black Jr., S.A. Palamakumbura A.H. Stan M. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15416-15429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that, like TGFβ1, LPA might stimulate JNK1 activation. To test this, cultures of primary gingival fibroblasts were grown to near confluence and serum-starved for 12 h. Cells were then stimulated with either 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 and/or 10 μm LPA for 0-15 min. Western blot analysis of JNK1 phosphorylation indicates that LPA stimulates JNK1 (Fig. 2A), and densitometric analyses demonstrate that the LPA-induced stimulation of JNK1 activation is similar in intensity as that observed following stimulation with TGFβ1 (Fig. 2B). Because we had observed an apparent additive effect of TGFβ1 in combination with LPA on CCN2/CTGF expression (Fig. 1B), we wished to determine whether the levels of activated JNK1 were similarly increased in response to co-stimulation. Data show no increase in activated JNK1 beyond that observed in response to TGFβ1 alone (Fig. 2C). This finding suggests that LPA stimulation of CCN2/CTGF in gingival fibroblasts may be mediated by signal transduction pathways in addition to JNK1 activation.FIGURE 2TGFβ1 and LPA stimulate comparable levels of phospho-JNK1 in human gingival fibroblasts. Gingival fibroblast cultures serum-starved for 12 h were treated with 10 μm LPA, 5 ng/ml TGFβ1, or both for times indicated prior to harvest of total cell layer protein. A, representative Western blot of phosphorylated JNK1 in response to LPA or TGFβ1. B, densitometric analysis from three separate experiments showing no significant difference between the TGFβ1- and LPA-stimulated inductions of phosphorylated JNK1.

https://openalex.org/W2095761725,"Ligand-directed delivery of agents to leukemia and lymphoma cells has the potential to yield new mechanistic disease insights and targeted therapies. Here we set out to target the macropinocytotic pathway with a combinatorial approach. From the screening of acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia Molt-4 cells with a random phage-display peptide library, we isolated a phage displaying the sequence CAYHRLRRC. This peptide contains a lymph node-homing motif (Cys-Ala-Tyr) and a cell-penetrating motif (Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg). Binding of this ligand-directed phage to a large panel of leukemia/lymphoma cells and to patient-derived samples was much higher than to non-leukemia control cells. CAYHRLRRC phage internalization into Molt-4 cells is both energy- and temperature-dependent. Flow cytometry with fluorescein-labeled peptide and endocytosis blocking with specific inhibitors revealed that CAYHRLRRC is indeed taken up through macropinocytosis in Molt-4 and K562 human leukemia cells. Unexpectedly, the cell surface receptor for the CAYHRLRRC peptide is not a heparan sulfate proteoglycan as it would be predicted for other cell-penetrating peptides. Confirming this interpretation, a CAYHRLRRC-directed peptidomimetic-induced cell death in all the leukemia and lymphoma cells was evaluated, whereas a control transactivator of transcription protein (tat)-directed proapoptotic peptidomimetic was non-selective. In summary, the targeting peptide CAYHRLRRC is selectively internalized through macropinocytosis in leukemia and lymphoma cells and has potential as a drug lead for ligand-directed anti-leukemia therapies.

Leukemias and lymphomas are hematological malignant diseases characterized by impaired differentiation, increased clonal cell proliferation, and hematopoiesis suppression; the standard treatment for these tumors today is still predominantly based on nonspecific cytotoxics that disrupt nucleic acid and protein synthesis, often with severe side effects and relatively poor outcomes (1Pui C.H.

Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 834-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), thus conceptually validating the scientific hope for a revolutionary targeted pharmacology against this group of diseases. Over the past decade, we have selected phage-display random peptide libraries in vitro and in vivo to isolate and exploit tumor-specific and angiogenesis-related ligand-receptor systems toward targeted drug design and translation (5Kolonin M.

Thus, rather than attempt to identify other ligand (peptide)-receptor (protein) systems in leukemia- or lymphoma-derived cells, we reasoned that targeting a physiological cell translocation mechanism may serve as an alternative approach to this challenge. As a proof-concept, here we selected cell-penetrating peptides that target the macropinocytotic pathway. Macropinocytosis has recently been recognized as a major pathway for the endocytic uptake of arginine-rich peptides and their protein conjugates (12Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat.

Indeed, macropinocytosis is mechanistically different from pinocytosis pathways, such as clathrin-mediated, caveola-dependent, and clathrin- and caveola-independent endocytosis (18Swanson J.A.

In the present study, we demonstrate the selection of cell-penetratings peptides that target the macropinocytotic pathway. In the dominant cell-penetrating peptide selected in one of the screenings, we also found a secondary motif likely responsible for the observed leukemia/lymphoma cell specificity. Finally, we functionally evaluated our cell-penetrating peptide prototype in its ability to specifically deliver a proapoptotic peptidomimetic to a panel of leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cells, relative to a panel of adherent tumor cells and normal leukocytes. Together, these results define a new combinatorial strategy for macropinocytosis-based studies with potential for targeted drug delivery to human leukemia and lymphoma cells.

BD Cell-TAK was from BD Biosciences. The WST-8 cell counting kit was from Dojin Chemical (Kumamoto, Japan). All the peptide synthetic reagents were from Applied Biosytems, Novabiochem, and Watanabe Chemical Co. (Hiroshima, Japan). Cell Lines—Leukemia and lymphoma cell lines or adherent non-leukemia tumor cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin, in 5% CO2. The leukemia and lymphoma cells were obtained as follows: Molt-4, CCRF-CEM, Jurkat-T, T-ALL1, HL-60, and U937, Health Science Research Resources Bank (HSRRB), Osaka, Japan; HPB-ALL, RPMI-8226, THP-1, and K562, Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; and SR-796 and TUR, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA.

Peptide-display Phage Library Screening—A phage-display random peptide library based on an fUSE5-derived vector displaying an insert with the general arrangement CX7C (C, cysteine; X, any residue) was designed and constructed with a diversity of 108 to 109 unique sequences (21Arap W. Kolonin M.G. Trepel M. Lahdenranta J. Cardó-Vila M. Giordano R.J. Mintz P.J. Ardelt P.U. Yao V.J. Vidal C.I. Chen L. Flamm A. Valtanen H. Weavind L.M. Hicks M.E. Pollock R.E. Botz G.H. Bucana C.D.

We used the biopanning and rapid analysis of selective interactive ligands (termed BRASIL) methodology for the screening of cell-binding phage (22Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23Kolonin M.G. Bover L. Sun J. Zurita A.J. Do K.A. Lahdenranta J. Cardó-Vila M. Giordano R.J.

In each screening, human leukemia Molt-4 cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2.5 mm EDTA, and re-suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% BSA (BRASIL binding buffer) at 1 × 104 cells per ml. The cell suspension (200 μl) was incubated with 109 TU of the CX7C phage library or of each phage at 4 °C. After 2 h, the phage/cell mixture (aqueous phase) was gently transferred to the top of a non-miscible organic phase (200 μl/tube) consisting of dibutyl phthalate:cyclohexane (9:1 (v/v), p = 1.03 g ml-1) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The tube was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, the bottom of the tube was sliced-off, and the cell-phage pellet was isolated. The cell-bound phages were recovered by infection of host bacteria (K91/kan). After rounds 2, 3, and 4, isolated bacteria cells from single clones were grown as individual colonies, and inserts from randomly picked clones were sequenced with the primer 5′-CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACGATCT-3′. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized by using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a Pioneer peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to >95%. Identification of the peptides was carried out by mass analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptides containing two cysteine residues derived from the CX7C library were cyclized by air oxidation prior to purification. Fluorescein-labeled peptides were synthesized by introduction of 5-carboxyfluorescein or 5-carboxyfluorescein tetramethylrhodamine to the N terminus at the final synthetic cycle. The abbreviations and sequence of each of the synthetic peptides were as follows: CAYHRLRRC, ACAYHRLRRC-GG; SAYHRLRRS, A-SAYHRLRRS-GG; CAYHALAAC, A-CAYHALAAC-GG; CAYHALAAC-D(KLAKLAK)2, A-CAYHRLRRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2; tat-D(KLAKLAK)2, GGRKKRRQKRRR-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2; fam-CAYHALAAC, 5-carboxyfluorescein-A-CAYHRLRRC-GG; tamra-CAYHALAAC, 5-tetramethylcarboxyfluorescein-A-CAYHRLRRC-GG; fam-tat, 5-carboxyfluorescein-GG-GRKKRRQKRRR-GGC. The extra residues Ala (at the N terminus) and Gly-Gly (at the C terminus) of the CX7C sequence were added (as a phage sequence-derived residue and a spacer, respectively). Gly-Gly at the N terminus and Gly-Gly-Cys at the C terminus of tat were also added as spacers to prevent steric hindrance. Phage Binding Assay—Phage binding assays were performed as described (22Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23Kolonin M.G. Bover L. Sun J. Zurita A.J. Do K.A. Lahdenranta J. Cardó-Vila M. Giordano R.J. Jaalouk D.E. Ozawa M.G. Moya C.A.

A total of 106 cells were incubated in the BRASIL binding buffer with 107 TU of the CAYHRLRRC phage or fd-tet phage at 4 °C for 2 h. Cell-bound phage was separated from unbound phage by BRASIL selection and was recovered by infecting the host bacteria (K91/kan) followed by counting the bacterial colonies at serial dilutions. Insertless fd-tet phage served as a negative control. The CAYHRLRRC phage binding to the cells is shown relative to that of the fd-tet phage (which was set to 1). Competition assays were performed with or without the competitor under the same conditions. For removal of cell surface proteins, the cells were pretreated with 0.1% (w/v) trypsin, serum-free medium for 10 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was subsequently inhibited by the addition of 1 volume of fetal bovine serum, and the cells were washed with BRASIL buffer prior to use in the binding assay. Phage Internalization Assays—We performed an internalization assay combined with phage binding. 106 cells were incubated with 109 TU of CAYHRLRRC phage for 1 h at 37 or 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were treated in fetal bovine serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% (w/v) trypsin medium to remove cell surface-bound, non-internalized phage. After washes with PBS, cells were either lysed with hypotonic buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) or not lysed (control). The residual titer was quantified by addition of Kanamycin-resistant Escherichia coli K91/kan to the cell lysate or intact cells. Recovery of the phage was shown relative to each non-lysed phage, which was incubated at 4 °C (which was set to 1). Alternatively, fluorescent microscopic analysis was carried out as described (25Zurita A.J. Troncoso P. Cardó-Vila M. Logothetis C.J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 106 cells were incubated with CAYHRLRRC phage (109 TU) at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, rendered permeable with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Cells were next incubated with a rabbit anti-fd bacteriophage antibody diluted 1:1000 (v/v) in 1% in BSA, PBS at room temperature for 2 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:500 (v/v) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After washes with PBS, cells were fixed on coverslips by air-drying. Phage particles were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus FV300, Tokyo, Japan; Keyence Bio-Zero, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a ×40 objective lens. Control fd-tet phage or FITC-labeled transferrin (5 μm) was used as a negative control or clathrin-dependent endocytosis marker, respectively. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2.5 μg/ml). Peptide Internalization Assay—Internalization of the peptide was analyzed by flow cytometry on living cells (15Richard J.P. Melikov K. Brooks H. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15300-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Leukemia Molt-4 and K562 cells were treated with the fluorescein-labeled peptide (fam-CAYHRLRRC or fam-tat) at various concentrations in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at the indicated temperature and times. Cells were treated with 0.1% (w/v) trypsin for 10 min to remove extracellular bound proteins and peptides. After incubation, 1 volume of calf serum was added to inhibit the enzyme, the cells were washed with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution three times, and the internalized peptides were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 cells/assay was analyzed by gating on live cells and exclusion of propidium iodide-labeled dead cells. For depletion of cellular ATP or inhibition assays, cells were preincubated with 10 mm sodium azide and 8 mm 2-deoxyglucose, or with other compounds (100 μm chlorpromazine, 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin, 10 μm wortmannin, or 1 mg/ml sodium heparin), respectively, for 30 min prior to addition of the peptide. The cells were subsequently incubated with 50 μm fam-CAYHRLRRC or 10 μm fam-tat and subjected to flow cytometry under the conditions described above. For enzyme treatment, the cells were preincubated with 0.1% trypsin or 0.5 units/ml heparinase III to remove cell surface proteins or heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans, respectively. After two washes with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, the cells were incubated with the fluorescein-labeled peptide. For colocalization, the cells were preincubated with 50 μm fluorescein-labeled peptide (fam-CAYHRLRRC or tamra-CAYHRLRRC) in serum-free medium at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of a fluorescent endocytosis marker (5 μm FITC-Tf or 10 μm TRITC-ND70) for 30 min at 37 °C. After 3 washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution, the cells were plated on BD Cell-TAK-coated glass bottom dishes without fixation to avoid artifactual localization of the internalized peptides (26Richard J.P.

The distribution of the peptide and marker was analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Cell Viability Assay—Leukemia and lymphoma cells (2 × 104 cells per well) or non-leukemia cells (5 × 103 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plates in 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively. After 12 h, the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the peptides CAYHRLRRC-D(KLAKLAK)2, CAYHRLRRC, or D(KLAKLAK)2 for 16 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was measured with a WST-8 cell counting kit. Patient and Control Samples—Human mononuclear leukocytes or primary leukemia cells were collected by Lym-pholyte-H (Cedarlane, Hornby, Canada) centrifugation from healthy voluntary laboratory personnel or from stored samples from leukemia patients from the Cell Bank at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Specialized Program in Research Excellence (SPORE) in Leukemia, respectively. Normal T-cell lymphocytes and monocytes were prepared from mononuclear cells as non-adherent cells and adherent cells, respectively. M2-type macrophages from normal monocytes (>85% CD14 positive) were differentiated with 5 ng/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor in 10% fetal calf serum, RPMI 1640 medium as described (27Xu W. Roos A. Schlagwein N. Woltman A.M. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. Blood. 2006; 107: 4930-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Six days after differentiation, about 40% cells were positive for the M2 marker CD163 (28Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All data are reported as the average mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance (n = 3, unless otherwise stated). p values, where statistical significance was achieved, are reported. Isolation Phage Selective for Leukemic Cells—A phage-display random peptide library CX7C (7-mer peptides bounded by cysteine at their N and C termini) was screened on an acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Molt-4, with the BRASIL method (22Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We performed phage selection in excess of a competing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) synthetic integrin-binding peptide to minimize the recovery of RGD-containing peptides (23Kolonin M.G. Bover L. Sun J. Zurita A.J. Do K.A. Lahdenranta J. Cardó-Vila M. Giordano R.J. Jaalouk D.E. Ozawa M.G. Moya C.A. Souza G.R. Staquicini F.I. Kuniyasu A. Scudiero D.A. Holbeck S.L. Sausville E.A. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After the 2 to 4 rounds of serial selection, individual clones (n = 96) were recovered from the Molt-4 cell lines and sequenced. We looked for arginine-rich motifs reminiscent of cell-penetrating peptides (29Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 30Vives E.

Notably, the amino acid sequence of this dominant peptide was composed of a chimera of one such arginine-rich motif (Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg) commonly found in cell-penetrating peptides (29Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 30Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

Pasqualini R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8110-8112PubMed Google Scholar). The unexpected but tantalizing finding of a “dual motif” led us to pursue further analysis of the selected peptide in anticipation that some selectivity for leukemia and lymphoma cells might actually be observed.TABLE 1Recovery of the CAYHRLRRC from a phage display library selectionRoundCAYHRLRRC/total clones%21/961.04317/9617.7455/9657.3 Open table in a new tab The CAYHRLRRC Phage Bind to Leukemia/Lymphoma Cell Lines—We tested whether the CAYHRLRRC phage bound to a variety of human leukemia/lymphoma or non-leukemia cell lines at 4 °C. Compared with insertless fd-tet phage (negative control), the CAYHRLRRC phage bound much more to Molt-4 cells (Fig. 1). Indeed, the CAYHRLRRC phage bound more to all of the T-ALL cells (CCRF-CEM, Jurkat-T, TALL-1, and HPB-ALL) over control. Moreover, the CAYHRLRRC phage also bound to myeloma RPMI-8226, erythrocytic-megakaryocytic K562, acute myelocytic HL-60, and monocytic THP-1 as well. Finally, the CAYHRLRRC phage bound to human lymphoma cells such as SR-786, U937, and TUR. Together, these data indicate that the CAYHRLRRC phage bound preferentially to all leukemia-derived and lymphoma-derived cell lines tested. In contrast, binding to a panel of assorted non-leukemia tumor cell lines such as A549, MCF-7, and HepG2 occurred at levels similar to that of negative control phage (Fig. 1). CAYHRLRRC phage therefore showed a significant selectivity of binding to leukemia/lymphoma cell lines grown in suspension rather than to adherent, non-leukemia lines. We next tested whether the CAYHRLRRC phage bound to normal leukocytes or primary tumor cells cultured from a representative panel of leukemia patients. In 10 of 13 clinical samples (77%), CAYHRLRRC phage bound more than twice relative to the fd-tet phage; binding of CAYHRLRRC phage to 3 leukemia samples was similar to control as it was binding to human bone marrow-derived cells, T-cell lymphocytes, monocytes, and M2-type macrophages from healthy peripheral blood (Table 2). Collectively, these results indicate that the selected chimeric (dual motif) peptide CAYHRLRRC has potential to target leukemia in translational applications.TABLE 2Binding of CAYHRLRRC phage to leukemia samples and normal leukocytesPatient No.Leukemia subclass (FAB classification)aFAB, French-American-British.Phage bindingbBinding of the CAYHRLRRC phage to primary mononuclear cells either from patients with leukemia or from normal (healthy) volunteers was evaluated by the BRASIL method.

Open table in a new tab Arginine Residues in the CAYHRLRRC Peptide Are Critical for Binding—To identify the residues of the CAYHRLRRC peptide that are required for phage binding, we carried out competition assays with synthetic peptides. Binding of the CAYHRLRRC phage to Molt-4 cells was inhibited by the corresponding synthetic CAYHRLRRC peptide in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A;IC50 ∼ 20 μm). A linear peptide analog SAYHRLRRS, in which the terminal two cysteines were changed to serines, also inhibited phage binding in vitro. In contrast, a synthetic peptide in which the three Arg residues were changed into Ala residues failed to inhibit phage binding. These results indicate that secondary structure via the disulf"
https://openalex.org/W1992102609,"Proline and hydroxyproline are metabolized by distinct pathways. Proline is important for protein synthesis, as a source of glutamate, arginine, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, and for participating in a metabolic cycle that shuttles redox equivalents between mitochondria and cytosol. Hydroxyproline, in contrast, is not reutilized for protein synthesis. The first steps in the degradation of proline and hydroxyproline are catalyzed by proline oxidase (POX) and hydroxyproline oxidase (OH-POX), respectively. Because it is well documented that POX is induced by p53 and plays a role in apoptosis, we considered whether OH-POX also participates in the response to cytotoxic stress. In LoVo and RKO cells, which respond to adriamycin with a p53-mediated induction of POX and generation of reactive oxygen species, we found that adriamycin also induced OH-POX gene expression and markedly increased OH-POX catalytic activity, and this increase in activity was not observed in the cell lines HT29 and HCT15, which do not have a functional p53. We also observed an increase in reactive oxygen species generation and activation of caspase-9 with adriamycin in a hydroxyproline-dependent manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that OH-POX plays a role analogous to POX in growth regulation, ROS generation, and activation of the apoptotic cascade."

Although the catalytic activities of many of these enzymes are somewhat predictable based on their amino acid sequences, the functions of their abundant ancillary modules are not and remain poorly studied. Here, we present the structural and functional analysis of a new family of ancillary carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), CBM51, which was previously annotated in data bases as the novel putative CBM domain. The high resolution crystal structures of two CBM51 members, GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51, from a putative family 95 α-fucosidase and from a family 98 blood group A/B antigen-specific endo-β-galactosidase, respectively, showed them to have highly similar β-sandwich folds.

Carbohydrates have critical functions in numerous biological events, including, for example, the movement and interactions of cells and proteins in animals, the recycling of plant cell wall carbohydrates, and the interactions between hosts and disease-causing organisms. Central to the role of carbohydrates in biological processes are protein-carbohydrate interactions. Non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding proteins (e.g. lectins, antibodies, and transport proteins) and catalytic carbohydrate-active enzymes are finely tuned to recognize particular carbohydrate structural motifs. The information content of glycans is realized through the specificity of non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding proteins (like lectins and antibodies), whereas carbohydrate-active enzymes change the information content and often unlock the energy contained within these molecules. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) 3The abbreviations used are: CBMs, carbohydrate-binding modules; NPCBM, novel putative CBM; GalNAc, d-N-acetylgalactosamine. are a comparatively new class of non-catalytic carbohydrate-recognizing polypeptide that are generally defined by their presence as ancillary modules in larger, multimodular carbohydrate-active enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases, glycosyltransferases, and polysaccharide lyases (1Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). In the context of these enzymes, the role of CBMs is to specifically bind the carbohydrate substrate and hold the enzyme in proximity to the substrate, allowing catalysis to proceed more efficiently (2Bolam D.N. Ciruela A. Mcqueen-Mason S. Simpson P. Williamson M.P. Rixon J.E. Boraston A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The number of CBM families, which are defined on the basis of amino acid sequence similarity, has grown to the current number of 50 (www.cazy.org). Although the majority of these families are known to have members that recognize primarily plant cell wall polysaccharides, a growing number of families appear to have specificity for animal glycans and appear within the modular structures of carbohydrate-active bacterial virulence factors (3Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37748-37757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Boraston A.B. Ficko-Blean E. Healey M.

Biol. 2007; 14: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In these cases, the CBMs appear to have a role in recognizing the information content of cellular glycans, which then allows the enzymatic activity of the virulence factor to be appropriately directed. One of the current challenges in this area, which is complicated by the great diversity of eukaryotic glycans, is to determine the specificity, strength, and molecular determinants of these CBM-glycan interactions. In turn, this provides key information about the cellular targets of the entire carbohydrate-active virulence factor, thus providing greater insight into the host-pathogen interaction. Clostridium perfringens is a ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterium that is capable of causing an array of diseases such as gastroenteritis and gas gangrene in humans and animals. The genus Clostridium (and the species perfringens in particular) is notable for its prolific production of toxins that contribute to its virulence (7Rood J.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8Petit L. Gibert M. Popoff M.R. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Among its minor toxins are a battery of carbohydrate-active enzymes of the class glycoside hydrolase, which are thought to aid in major toxin delivery, tissue destruction, and nutrient harvesting while in the host. The two myonecrotic strains of C. perfringens for which the genome sequences are available are remarkable for their content of highly modular glycoside hydrolases (9Shimizu T. Ohtani K. Hirakawa H.

Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Each strain contains in excess of 50 open reading frames encoding putative glycoside hydrolases, many of which are extracellular and rarely smaller than 1000 amino acids in length and frequently contain, in addition to the catalytic module, three or more definable ancillary modules (3Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37748-37757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These ancillary modules include CBMs (3Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37748-37757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Boraston A.B. Ficko-Blean E. Healey M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11352-11360Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), putative protein-protein interaction domains (11Chitayat S. Gregg K. Adams J.J. Ficko-Blean E. Bayer E.A. Boraston A.B. Smith S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and modules of unknown function. One such unknown module, which occurs quite frequently in the C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases as well as in proteins from a variety of other organisms, is the novel putative CBM (NPCBM) domain. NPCBM domains show no amino acid sequence identity to known carbohydrate-binding proteins but were hypothesized by Rigden (12Rigden D.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5466-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to be CBMs based on their context (i.e. in carbohydrate-active enzymes) and their proposed β-sandwich fold, which is common to CBMs. To test the hypothesized carbohydrate-binding function of these modules, we performed structural and functional studies on the NPCBMs from two different multimodular clostridial enzymes, one a hypothesized family 95 α-l-fucosidase (CPF_2129 from C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124) and the other a confirmed family 98 blood group A/B antigen-specific endo-β-d-galactosidase (EabC from C. perfringens strain ATCC 10543) (Fig. 1) (13Anderson K.M. Ashida H. Maskos K. Dell A. Li S.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7720-7728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The two targeted modules share only ∼30% amino acid sequence identity. The results confirm the identification of NPCBMs as a new CBM family, now classified as CBM51, and define a new module that can mediate the carbohydrate-based interaction of the enzymes with host tissues. Furthermore, an unexpected degree of diversity in specificity and binding site architecture is evident in this new CBM family, providing some distinction from other CBM families. Cloning, Gene Expression, and Protein Production and Purification—The gene fragments encoding GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 were PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of C. perfringens strains ATCC 13124 and ATCC 10543, respectively, using the following sets of primers: GH95CBMF (5′-CAT ATG GCT AGC GAA AAG GTT GCA GTT G-3′) and GH95CBMR (5′-GAA TTC CTC GAG TTA TGT TAA CTT AGC G-3′) for GH95CBM51 and GH98CBMF (5′-CAT ATG GCT AGC GAA GTT TAT GCT TTG GAA GAA AGC G-3′) and GH98CBMR (5′-GAA TTC CTC GAG TTA ATT CAC AAA ATC ACC CTT AGC TGT C-3′) for GH98CBM51. The amplified products were digested with NheI and XhoI restriction endonucleases and ligated to like digested pET-28a using standard cloning procedures. The resulting plasmids, pGH95CBM and pGH98CBM, encode the desired CBM fused to an N-terminal His6 tag by a thrombin protease cleavage site. Polypeptides were produced in 4-liter cultures of Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) containing pGH95CBM and pGH98CBM using the methods described previously (3Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37748-37757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography from cell-free extracts following previously described procedures (3Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37748-37757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Purified polypeptides were concentrated and exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in a stirred ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA) using a 5-kDa cutoff membrane (Filtron Corp., Northborough, MA). Purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE was >95%. Selenomethionine-labeled GH95CBM51 was produced using the E. coli B834(DE3) methionine auxotroph. E. coli colonies taken from an LB-agar plate were used to inoculate 3 liters of SelenoMet Medium Base (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) supplemented with SelenoMet Nutrient Mix (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) and l-selenomethionine (40 mg/liter). These cultures were grown, induced, and harvested, and the polypeptide was purified exactly as described for the unlabeled protein. Determination of Protein Concentration—The concentration of purified protein was determined by UV absorbance (280 nm) using calculated molar extinction coefficients of 17,420 and 24,410 m-1 cm-1 for GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51, respectively. Binding Studies—Proteins for glycan array screening were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Labeled protein was desalted and separated from free fluorescein isothiocyanate by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-25 (GE Healthcare). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 were used to probe the printed glycan arrays following the standard procedure of Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (www.functionalglycomics.org/). Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed as described previously using a VP-ITC system (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) (3Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37748-37757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein samples were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2 and then concentrated in a stirred ultrafiltration cell as described above. Sugar solutions were prepared by mass in buffer saved from the ultrafiltration step. Both protein and sugar solutions were filtered and degassed immediately prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance as described above. Although the concentrations of acceptor (i.e. GH95CBM51 or GH98CBM51) were quite high (between 200 and 500 μm), the low affinities of the interactions resulted in C values <2 (14Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the 1:1 binding observed in the crystal structures, the data were fit with a single binding site model using stoichiometries fixed at 1. The association constants (Ka) were determined by this fitting process. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51, previously exchanged into 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), were treated overnight at room temperature with thrombin to remove the His6 tag. The polypeptides were separated from the cleaved His6 tag by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare). Pure fractions were concentrated in a 10-ml stirred ultrafiltration device using a 5-kDa cutoff membrane. All crystallizations were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Diffraction data for all crystals except the selenomethionine-substituted GH95CBM51 crystals were collected on our home source: a Rigaku R-AXIS 4++ area detector coupled to an MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic Blue optics and an Oxford 700 series Cryostream. All data were processed using Crystal Clear/d*trek (15Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar).

An optimized selenium single anomalous dispersion diffraction data set for selenomethionine-labeled GH95CBM51 was collected on beamline X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratories). SHELXC/D was used to determine the substructure of three selenium atoms, followed by refinement and phasing with SHARP (16Evans G. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 976-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening with DM resulted in easily interpretable electron density maps (17Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Automatic model building with ARP/wARP yielded a virtually complete model that was finished by manual model building using COOT and refinement with REFMAC (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar, 19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). This selenium-substituted model was used as a starting point for the higher resolution native structure. GH95CBM51 at 45 mg/ml was co-crystallized with 50 mm methyl-β-d-galactose in 0.2 m magnesium acetate, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.8), and 16% polyethylene glycol 3350. This structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (21Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and the native GH95CBM51 model as a template. Crystals of GH98CBM51 at 15 mg/ml were grown in 0.2 m magnesium acetate, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350. This structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of GH95CBM51 as a search model and MOLREP to find the one molecule in the asymmetric unit. After manual correction of this model, ARP/wARP was able to build a model that required minimum alteration using COOT and refinement with REFMAC. A crystal form of GH98CBM51 obtained in 0.2 m sodium carbonate, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 was soaked with the blood group A and B antigen trisaccharides (Dextra Laboratories) at 5 mm in mother liquor to obtain complexes with these sugars. This process resulted in the alteration of the unit cell dimensions and space group from a = 36.42, b = 49.54, and c = 88.45 Å (P212121; structure not reported, as it did not yield any new information) to a = 69.68, b = 98.75, and c = 49.24 Å (P21212) but nevertheless yielded excellent complexes. The new asymmetric unit of the soaked crystals contained two molecules of GH98CBM51, each bound to carbohydrate, which were located with the molecular replacement program MOLREP. Building and refinement were carried as described above. Water molecules were added to all models using the REFMAC implementation of ARP/wARP (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) and inspected visually prior to deposition. In all data sets, 5% of the observations were flagged as “free” (22Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) and used to monitor refinement procedures. All final model statistics are given in Table 1. Structure images were prepared with PyMOL. Bioinformatic Analysis—Putative CBM51 domains were detected by position-specific iterative BLAST searches (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) using both GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 as queries. Polypeptides containing similar amino acid sequences were dissected for modularity by InterProScan (24Zdobnov E.M. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2001; 17: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar) and classified when possible based on the predicted enzymatic specificity for an appended catalytic module. In some cases, boundary positions were fine-tuned by direct sequence alignments with ClustalW (25Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). For enzymes that contained tandem copies of CBM51, each module was treated independently. Sequence entries were cut off at >20% identity over a minimum of 100 amino acids. Phylogenetic tree construction was performed with PhyloDraw Version 0.8 (26Choi J.H. Jung H.Y. Kim H.S. Cho H.G. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2000; 16: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A New Family of Carbohydrate-binding Modules—To facilitate the characterization of NPCBMs in isolation, the gene fragments encoding the modules were cloned and overexpressed in E. coli, and the polypeptides were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified polypeptides, here called GH95CBM51 (from C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124 GH95) and GH98CBM51 (from C. perfringens strain ATCC 10543 GH98), were screened for glycan binding by Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics using glycan microarrays. Both proteins displayed the ability to recognize glycans (Fig. 2). GH98CBM51 was clearly the more specific module, showing binding only to glycans bearing the blood group A or B antigen trisaccharide determinants (Fig. 2B). This specificity is in keeping with the blood group antigen specificity of GH98 (EabC) (13Anderson K.M. Ashida H. Maskos K. Dell A. Li S.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7720-7728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, GH95CBM51 appeared to interact with a large number of the glycans presented in this array. The common determinant of the best hits was terminal galacto-configured sugars, either d-galactose or d-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (Fig. 2A). The exceptions contained galactose following terminal α-2,6-linked sialic acid or α-1,2-linked fucose. GH95 is a predicted α-fucosidase; thus, the binding specificity of its CBM, GH95CBM51, is somewhat at odds with the predicted catalytic specificity. The biological significance of this is currently unknown. The carbohydrate-binding activities of GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 were confirmed and quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry. GH95CBM51 bound Galβ1-3GalNAc and methyl-β-d-Gal with association constants of (1.48 ± 0.05) × 103 and (0.48 ± 0.04) × 103 m-1, respectively. GH98CBM51 bound the A antigen tetrasaccharide (Gal-NAcα1-3(Fucα1-2)Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ-CH2-CH2-N3) and B antigen tetrasaccharide (Galα1-3(Fucα1-2)Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ-CH2-CH2-N3) with association constants of (3.85 ± 0.25) × 103 and (1.30 ± 0.01) × 103 m-1, respectively. In general, these affinities are on the lower end of the affinity range for protein-carbohydrate interactions. The higher affinity of GH95CBM51 for the disaccharide ligand Galβ1-3GalNAc versus the methylated galactose monosaccharide suggests additional interactions with the second sugar residue. GH98CBM51 showed a slight (2-3-fold) preference for the blood group A antigen tetrasaccharide in comparison with the blood group B antigen tetrasaccharide. This is consistent with the smaller observed signal for the blood group B antigen-containing glycans in the microarray binding analysis (Fig. 2B). Overall, these results demonstrate that these two examples of NPCBM domains are indeed carbohydrate-binding modules, and this family of modules has now been reclassified as CBM51. CBM51 Displays a Common Carbohydrate-binding Fold—We approached the question of what are the molecular determinants of specificity in these family 51 CBMs (NPCBMs) through x-ray crystallography. The x-ray crystal structures of GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 were solved by optimized selenium single anomalous dispersion and molecular replacement, respectively. Both modules adopt a β-sandwich fold comprising a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet opposing a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 3, A and B). The β-sandwich fold is common to numerous families of carbohydrate-binding proteins, including a number of CBM and lectin families (1Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). The atomic models of GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 are obviously similar and overlap with a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å over 140 matched residues (measured by the secondary structure matching algorithm (27Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) as implemented in COOT). The primary difference in the structures of these two polypeptides is a small insertion in GH98CBM51, which results in the addition of a small α-helix near the binding site (Fig. 3B). Relative to GH95CBM51, this addition in GH98CBM51 appears to play a role in recontouring the binding site to accommodate the larger blood group A/B carbohydrates. Both polypeptides bind a metal atom (Fig. 3, A and B) that was judged to be Ca2+ based on the strictly oxygen-mediated coordination, coordination bond lengths that range from 2.25 to 2.40 Å, a B-factor when modeled as Ca2+ that is consistent with the neighboring atoms, and a small peak of anomalous signal that overlaps with the position of this atom (data not shown). The position of this atom is conserved between GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51 (within 0.6 Å in a structural overlap) but is not conserved in other CBM families. In the case of these family 51 CBMs, the metal-binding site is at the interface of the two β-sheets (the edge of the sandwich) and in the loops that join the termini of the β-strands, near the carbohydrate-binding site (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the majority of other CBM families that bind metal atoms, which notably are all also β-sandwich proteins, do so at a site that is also at the edge of the sandwich but on a side such that the binding site is on the edge of the strands rather than at the ends (oFig. 3C). GH95CBM51 Has a Simple Galactose-binding Site—A ligand-bound form of GH95CBM51 was obtained by co-crystallization of the protein with excess methyl-β-d-galactose. The electron density for this sugar was very clear, allowing unambiguous modeling of the ligand (Fig. 4A). The binding site of GH95CBM51 is quite shallow (Fig. 4A) and provides surprisingly few direct interactions with the sugar (Fig. 4B). The ∈-nitrogens of His955 and His1041 make hydrogen bonds with the sugar O-4 and O-3, respectively (Fig. 4B). The galactose O-4 also makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of Ser1039 (Fig. 4B). The phenol group of Tyr922 makes a classical protein-carbohydrate hydrophobic interaction with the apolar plane formed by C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 on the B-face of the galactose. This mode of interaction, which requires an equatorial O-2, an equatorial O-3, and an axial O-4, is consistent with the observed specificity of GH95CBM51 for terminal galacto-configured sugars. However, the galactose O-2 and O-6 are solvent-exposed, suggesting that modifications may be tolerated at these positions. Indeed, the array screening results indicated that this polypeptide can interact with terminal GalNAc (i.e. can tolerate an acetamido modification at C-2) and suggested an ability to accommodate a fucosyl residue α-1,2-linked to galactose. Likewise, the exposure of the O-6 group may also explain the apparent binding of GH95CBM51 to a glycan terminating in sialic acid α-2,6-linked to galactose. The galactose-binding site of GH95CBM51 shows a reasonable degree of architectural similarity to the binding sites of the galactose-specific family 32 CBMs, the best characterized of which is CpCBM32, the CBM32 from C. perfringens GH84C (NagJ) (3Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37748-37757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although GH95CBM51 and CpCBM32 show no significant amino acid sequence similarity, they share the same fold (root mean square deviation of ∼3.3 Å) and binding site location (Fig. 4C). Many of the protein-carbohydrate interactions are also conserved. Tyr922 of GH95CBM51 is structurally conserved with Trp661 o"
https://openalex.org/W2122225142,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) of Cystoviridae bacteriophages, like those of eukaryotic viruses of the Reoviridae, function inside the inner capsid shell in both replication and transcription. In bacteriophage Phi6, this inner shell is first assembled as an icosahedral procapsid with recessed 5-fold vertices that subsequently undergoes major structural changes during maturation. The tripartite genome is packaged as single-stranded RNA molecules via channels on the 5-fold vertices, and transcripts probably exit the mature capsid by the same route. The RdRP (protein P2) is assembled within the procapsid, and it was thought that it should be located on the 5-fold axes near the RNA entry and exit channels. To determine the initial location of the RdRP inside the procapsid of bacteriophage Phi6, we performed cryo-electron microscopy of wild type and mutant procapsids and complemented these data with biochemical determinations of copy numbers. We observe ring-like densities on the 3-fold axes that are strong in a mutant that has approximately 10 copies of P2 per particle; faint in wild type, reflecting the lower copy number of approximately 3; and completely absent in a P2-null mutant. The dimensions and shapes of these densities match those of the known crystal structure of the P2 monomer.

Whether dAKAP1 targets to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria depends on the presence of the N-terminal 33 amino acids (N1), and these N-terminal variants are generated by either alternative splicing and/or differential initiation of translation. The mitochondrial targeting motif, which is localized between residues 49 and 63, is comprised of a hydrophobic helix followed by positive charges (Ma, Y., and Taylor, S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 27328-27336). dAKAP1 is located on the cytosolic surface of mitochondria outer membrane and both smooth and rough ER membrane. A single residue, Asp31, within the first 33 residues of dAKAP1b is required for ER targeting. Asp31, which functions as a separate motif from the mitochondrial targeting signal, converts the mitochondrial-targeting signal into a bipartite ER-targeting signal, without destroying the mitochondria-targeting signal. Therefore dAKAP1 possesses a single targeting element capable of targeting to both mitochondria and ER, with the ER signal overlapping the mitochondria signal. The specificity of ER or mitochondria targeting is determined and switched by the availability of the negatively charged residue, Asp31. dAKAP1 (AKAP121, S-AKAP84), a dual specificity PKA scaffold protein, exists in several forms designated as a, b, c, and d.

Subcellular localization of PKA is typically achieved through the binding of the regulatory subunits to scaffold proteins termed AKAPs (a kinase-anchoring proteins) where different AKAPs are expressed in different cell types. Depending on the targeting domain or motif an AKAP carries, it can bring PKA to different subcellular locations such as the nucleus, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, mitochondria, microtubules, etc. (6Alto N.

Several isoforms of dAKAP1 have been identified in mouse, rat, and human varying at both the N terminus and the C terminus, with the PKA-binding domain located within the common core in the center of the molecule (9Huang L.J.

Avvedimento E.V. Feliciello A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Variation in the N terminus can alter the localization of dAKAP1 to either ER or mitochondria, thereby changing the distribution of PKA in the cell (18Huang L.J. Wang L. Ma Y. Durick K. Perkins G.

Similar to many known mitochondria-targeting signals, the mitochondria-targeting motif in dAKAP1 contains a hydrophobic region and positively charged residues to the immediate C terminus (19Ma Y.

To understand the role of PKA anchoring to ER and mitochondria and how this anchoring is regulated, we explored the molecular mechanism for dAKAP1 binding to both mitochondria and ER. Here we describe a novel mechanism that dAKAP1 employs to switch the anchoring of PKA between ER and mitochondria. Reagents—Antisera raised in the lab against PKA-Cat and dAKAP1 were used to detect PKA-Cat and dAKAP1. Other antibodies are from commercial sources: anti-mouse RIIα from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-CytC from BD Biosciences, anti-calnexin (against the cytosol-exposed C-terminal tail), and anti-calreticulin both from Abcam. DNA Constructs and Sequence Analysis—Murine dAKAP isoforms 1a and 1b were subcloned into the pCMV-Sport1 vector (Invitrogen) containing a C-terminal FLAG tag (19Ma Y. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27328-27336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regions of dAKAP1a (amino acids 34-175) or dAKAP1b (amino acids 1-175) were subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and XhoI. The proteins were in vitro translated with the quick-coupled T7 TnT system (Promega) as previously described (19Ma Y. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27328-27336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequences of dAKAP 1a and 1b (amino acids 1-63) were inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) with PCR. To avoid the interference of charged residues encoded by the polylinker, the sequence between KpnI and AgeI sites in the vector were replaced with a new linker (GGATCCGTGGCTCAGCTCACCGGT) that has a single BlpI recognition site. The sequences of anchoring domain were therefore inserted in between EcoRI and BlpI sites. Most of the mutations in the anchoring domain of dAKAP1 were made using Kunkel methods (28Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). A few difficult mutants were made by a modified quick change method (29Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The mitochondria marker, mtGFP (30Rizzuto R. Brini M. De Giorgi F. Rossi R. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 183-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. R. Y. Tsien (University of California, San Diego). The ER targeting marker, ER-GFP was a gift from Dr. D. G. Pestov (University of Illinois) (31Pestov D.G. Polonskaia M. Lau L.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The genomic organization of dAKAP1 was generated with online-genomic Blast analysis. Transfection Assay—10T 1/2 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 6-cm dishes containing 1.2-mm round coverslips (Fisher). The cells at 60-70% confluency were then transferred to a 24-well dish and transfected. Transfection was performed using either CytoFectine (Bio-Rad) or LipofectAmin-plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. When cells were co-transfected, different DNA constructs were incubated at an equal molar ratio, adjusted to the same total weight with blank vector. The cells were incubated for 6-7 h post-transfection before fixing and indirect immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence and Photo-microscopy—Immunofluorescent labeling was performed as previously described (19Ma Y. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27328-27336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Ma Y. Prigent S.A. Born T.L. Monell C.R. Feramisco J.R. Bertolaet B.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5341-5348PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. dAKAP1a was detected using a monoclonal αFLAG antibody (clone m2; Sigma) and a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). To detect wild type and mutants of dAKAP1b, a polyclonal antibody against N1 (18Huang L.J. Wang L. Ma Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was used n conjunction with a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Laboratory). The final concentration of the antibodies was 10 μg/ml. All of the antibodies were diluted in a solution containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and incubated with cells at 37 °C. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Slowfade medium (Molecular Probes) and analyzed on a Leica microscopy equipped with a Mitsubishi digital camera. Fractionation of Mitochondria and ER—Mitochondria and ER were isolated and purified from mouse liver according to Pagliarini et al. (33Pagliarini D.J. Wiley S.E. Kimple M.E. Dixon J.R. Kelly P.

Mouse liver was homogenized with a motor-driven 30-ml Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder five times in MSHE (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA). Nuclear material and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2300 rpm (600 × gmax) in a Sorval SS34 rotor. Crude mitochondrial fractions were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 11,200 rpm (15,000 × gmax). This fraction was then further purified by centrifugation on a Percoll-Histodenz gradient. The material between 17.5 and 35% Histodenz was collected as purified mitochondria (31Pestov D.G. Polonskaia M. Lau L.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The post-mitochondria supernatants were fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Ti70 rotor to collect crude ER as pellets (microsome) and supernatants (S100) (31Pestov D.G. Polonskaia M. Lau L.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Crude ER was further fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 29,000 rpm (100,000 × gmax) in a sw55 rotor for 16 h (34Sharma R.N. Behar-Bennelier M. Rolleston F.S. Murray R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2033-2043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth ER was collected between 0.25 and 1.3 m sucrose, and rough ER was collected between 1.3 and 2.5 m. Protein (20 μg) from each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. When fractions were protease treated, 5 μg of trypsin was incubated with the samples (350 μg of protein) for 0-10 min, followed by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor 100 μg and Complete (Roche Applied Science) proteinase inhibitors. When the fractions were washed with high salt and/or alkaline solutions, the samples (350 μg of protein) were incubated with either 200 or 500 mm KCl in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, or 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5 for 30 min on ice, according to previously published reports (35Miyazaki E.

The 33-residue N1 Fragment Is Generated by Alternative Splicing at the N Terminus of dAKAP1—dAKAP1 was cloned from a mouse embryonic library with multiple isoforms bearing several N and C termini (9Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Different clones from sperm, S-AKAP84 and AKAP121, have similar C-terminal variations but lack the N-terminal variant (17Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 we show the exon organization of dAKAP1. Mouse genomic BLAST analysis of these cDNA clones and the newly deposited dAKAP1 alleles AK076216, AK132749, and BC065135 revealed that these various termini match different exons, indicating that these isoforms are generated by alternative splicing (Fig. 1A). For simplicity, only one allele is shown to represent the three. dAKAP1a is the shortest protein. It is encoded by exon 4 and then directly linked exon 5. dAKAP1b is identical to 1a at the 3′ end. Other isoforms have two additional 3′ compositions beyond exon 4: dAKAP1c, 1d, AKAP121, AK076216, AK132749, and BC065135 have exons 4 and 5 plus exons 7-15 at the 3′ end that encode two putative RNA-binding domains, a K homology (KH) domain, and a Tudor domain (Fig. 1, A and B); S-AKAP84 is similar to the above variants except that it uses exon 6 instead of exon 5. S-AKAP84 is similar to dAKAP1a in size, because exon 6 contains an in-frame stop codon that encodes 24 residues, whereas dAKAP1a has 20 residues encoded by exon 5 in the same place. At the 5′ end, however, dAKAP1c is identical to dAKAP1a. There are three longer forms that are derived from differences at the 5′ end: one has exon 1 proceeding exon 4 (in AK076216 and BC065135), the second has exon 2 proceeding exon 4 (in dAKAP1b and 1d), and the third has exon 3 in front of exon 4 (in S-AKAP84, AK132749 and AKAP121). Exon 3 in AK132749 is 12 nucleotides shorter than AKAP121, probably because of strain variation. Because neither exon 1 or 3 have an in-frame initiation codon, translation of AKAP121, S-AKAP84, AK076216, AK132749, and BC065135 would start from exon 4, which corresponds to dAKAP1a and 1c, with the first initiation codon 32 nucleotides within the 5′ boundary of the exon 4. dAKAP1b and 1d, on the other hand, carry an initiation codon in exon 2 that is 68 nucleotides to the 3′ boundary and is in-frame with the protein encoded by exon 4. Therefore, in dAKAP1b and 1d, the merger of 68 nucleotides in exon 2 and the first 31 nucleotides at the beginning of exon 4 generates an extra fragment of 99 nucleotides encoding for 33 residues (Fig. 1C). The production of two isoforms at the N terminus by alternative splicing could therefore provide the primary mechanism to generate two anchoring proteins that target to different organelles in different tissues. Targeting to Different Organelles Can Be Generated by Alternative Initiation of Translation from a Single mRNA—Previously, we identified two N-terminal splice variants of dAKAP1 (18Huang L.J. Wang L. Ma Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The first splice variant is found in isoforms 1a and 1c, initiates transcription at exon 4, and encodes a protein that is targeted to the mitochondria. The second splice variant is found in isoforms 1b and 1d, initiates transcription at exon 2, and encodes a protein that is targeted to the ER. In addition to alternative splicing, initiation of translation from different codons provides an alternative mechanism for generating two proteins from a single gene (37Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In our initial studies, we wanted to examine whether different initiation codons exist within a single mRNA from dAKAP1. As diagramed in Fig. 2A, in dAKAP1, codons 1, 34, and 49 are all located in a consensus with optimal initiation of translation (38Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3873-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and can, therefore, potentially encode several dAKAP1 variants by a leaky scanning mechanism (37Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In vitro translation was used to determine whether multiple start sites in dAKAP1a and dAKAP1b exist. Fig. 2C shows that full-length dAKAP1b clearly has two distinct bands, one that co-migrates with dAKAP1a and a second slightly larger band, reflecting initiation from at least two positions (Fig. 2C). It was unclear from these experiments whether multiple start sites for dAKAP1a exist. To show the different initiation products more clearly, we analyzed the in vitro translation products with shorter constructs from the first 175 residues of dAKAP1a and 1b (Fig. 2D). In vitro translation of dAKAP1b generated two products from codons 1 and 34 (Fig. 2, C and D), whereas a mutant at Met34 and Met49 only produced the longer product (Fig. 2D). The shorter product in dAKAP1b is the same as the longer form of dAKAP1a and therefore should carry a mitochondria-targeting signal (Fig. 2B). Similarly, dAKAP1a can use the same mechanism to produce two products from codon 34 and 49 (Fig. 2D and Ref. 19Ma Y. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27328-27336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutation of Met49 abolished the shorter product. Both products can target to mitochondria (19Ma Y. Taylor S. J. Biol.

The generation of two molecules by differential initiation of translation sites for targeting to two organelles could also provide a mechanism for modulation of PKA distribution to different locations in cells. dAKAP1 Is Located on the Cytosolic Surface of Mitochondria and ER—To explore the mechanism of targeting and the potential role of dAKAP1 function in mitochondria and ER, we next wanted to biochemically characterize the localization of dAKAP1 on these two organelles. Mitochondria, smooth ER, and rough ER were isolated and purified from mouse liver as described under “Experimental Procedures.” dAKAP1 was primarily found in the mitochondria, smooth ER, and rough ER, with only a small amount in the post ER fraction (Fig. 3A). PKA-Cat is also found in all of the fractions. However, most of the PKA-Cat is in the post ER fraction, reflecting its multiple localizations and associations. Cytochrome c (CytC), a mitochondria protein, and calnexin, an ER protein, were used to measure the efficient separation of mitochondria and ER. Purified intact mitochondria were treated with trypsin transiently to determine whether dAKAP1 is topologically accessible. dAKAP1 was rapidly degraded, suggesting that it is localized on the cytosolic surface of the outer membrane of mitochondria (Fig. 3B). Treatment with trypsin did not affect CytC, which is located in the intermembrane space. Type II PKA was also degraded in a similar manner as dAKAP1, suggesting that most of the type II PKA on mitochondria co-exist with dAKAP1 (Fig. 3B). We next washed the mitochondria with high concentrations of KCl (0.2 m and 0.5 m) and Na2CO3 (0.1 m, pH11.5) to determine whether the association of dAKAP1 to mitochondria is through specific insertion in the membrane (Fig. 3B) (35Miyazaki E. Kida Y. Mihara K. Sakaguchi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1788-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Meisinger C. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Model K. Lim J.H. Sickmann A. Muller H. Meyer H.E. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). dAKAP1 was resistant to all of these washes. Alkaline treatment breaks the outer membrane and released CytC, but it does not wash away dAKAP1. Alkaline treatment removed most of the PKA-Cat but did not wash away RIIα. From this information, we conclude that dAKAP1 is inserted in the outer membrane of mitochondria. A similar set of experiments was undertaken for the rough ER (Fig. 3C) and smooth ER (Fig. 3D) to determine the localization of dAKAP1. Similar to results obtained for mitochondria, dAKAP1 was sensitive to trypsin and digested. The cytosol-exposed C-terminal tail of calnexin was also digested, but calreticulin, a lumen-associated protein, was not. Therefore, dAKAP1 appears to be located on the cytosolic surface of both smooth and rough ER. Most type II PKA on rough ER was digested away similar to dAKAP1, suggesting that most of the PKA on rough ER is on the cytosolic surface. However, type II PKA was only partially digested away along with dAKAP1 on smooth ER, suggesting that a certain amount of PKA is located in the lumen of smooth ER (Fig. 3D). Washing rough ER and smooth ER with high concentrations of KCl or Na2CO3 did not disrupt dAKAP1 association with smooth or rough ER, although alkaline conditions seem to have broken ER membranes and washed away some of PKA-Cat, but not PKA-RIIα. Therefore, we conclude that the association of dAKAP1 with rough ER or smooth ER is mediated through specific insertion of the protein into the membrane. The localization of dAKAP1 to the cytosolic surface of both ER and mitochondria suggest that similarities exist in targeting dAKAP1 to these organelles. A Negatively Charged Residue Is Required for ER Targeting—As previously established, dAKAP1b and dAKAP1d are alternatively spliced with exon 2 from the dAKAP1 gene and have 33 amino acids added to the N terminus (18Huang L.J. Wang L. Ma Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Ma Y. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27328-27336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These splice variants are localized to the ER rather than the mitochondria. Thus the extra 33 amino acids contain an element that modifies and converts the mitochondrial targeting signal in dAKAP1a into an ER-targeting signal. Our previous results indicate that deletion of the first 13 amino acids does not affect ER targeting in dAKAP1b (18Huang L.J. Wang L. Ma Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, the modifier element for ER targeting must be within residues 15-33. To determine the key element required for the conversion from mitochondrial to ER targeting, we conducted a series of substitution mutations within this region (Fig. 4). Of one double- and seven triple-amino acid scanning mutations tested, only one mutation region failed to target to ER (amino acids 31-33; Sub31A). As shown in Fig. 4B (panels g-i), this mutant targeted to mitochondria like dAKAP1a (Fig. 4B, panels a-c). To further identify the key element, residues 31-33 were mutated individually to Ala. Only Asp31 was found to be required for ER targeting; mutation of D31A targeted to mitochondria rather than ER (Fig. 4B, j-l). Other mutations at position 31 were tested.

Its activity must be strictly controlled to ensure proper cell cycle progression. The co-activator proteins Cdc20 and Cdh1 are required for APC activity and are important regulatory targets. Recently, budding yeast Acm1 was identified as a Cdh1 binding partner and APCCdh1 inhibitor. Acm1 disappears in late mitosis when APCCdh1 becomes active and contains conserved degron-like sequences common to APC substrates, suggesting it could be both an inhibitor and substrate. Surprisingly, we found that Acm1 proteolysis is independent of APC. A major determinant of Acm1 stability is phosphorylation at consensus cyclin-dependent kinase sites. Acm1 is a substrate of Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase and Cdc14 phosphatase both in vivo and in vitro. Mutation of Cdc28 phosphorylation sites or conditional inactivation of Cdc28 destabilizes Acm1. In contrast, inactivation of Cdc14 prevents Acm1 dephosphorylation and proteolysis. Cdc28 stabilizes Acm1 in part by promoting binding of the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2. We conclude that the opposing actions of Cdc28 and Cdc14 are primary factors limiting Acm1 to the interval from G1/S to late mitosis and are capable of establishing APC-independent expression patterns similar to APC substrates.

Many proteins involved in regulating cell division are only present during defined windows of the cell cycle. Cell cycle-dependent expression generally results from a combination of transcriptional regulation and ubiquitin proteolysis. Proteolysis provides a rapid and irreversible mechanism to eliminate proteins at specific times to promote transitions from one cell cycle stage to the next. Proteolysis is achieved by the covalent modification of specific substrate proteins with polyubiquitin chains, catalyzed by the joint action of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin ligases, which leads to their recognition and destruction by the 26 S proteasome (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar).

The SCF and APC are thought to function complementarily during cell division, and mounting evidence suggests that each regulates the activity of the other (2Vodermaier H.C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R787-R796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Yamasaki L. Pagano M. Curr. Opin.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The core APC is present throughout the cell cycle, but its activity is mostly limited to mitosis and G1 by a variety of regulatory mechanisms, emphasizing that fine control over APC activity is of critical importance to proper execution of the cell cycle. APC activity requires a WD40 repeat family co-activator protein, either Cdc20 or Cdh1, and availability of these co-activators determines the period of APC activity (5Kramer E.R. Gieffers C. Holzl G.

Cdc20 expression is cell cycle-dependent. It appears during S phase and then is destroyed by APCCdh1 in late mitosis (5Kramer E.R. Gieffers C. Holzl G. Hengstschlager M. Peters J.M. Curr.

Cdh1 on the other hand is present throughout the cell cycle, but its ability to interact with APC is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation (11Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6515-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ability of Cdc20 to activate APC is also controlled by phosphorylation, for example in response to checkpoint signals (15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Searle J.S. Schollaert K.L. Wilkins B.J. Sanchez Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An additional mechanism of APCCdh1 regulation involves autoubiquitination (17Listovsky T. Oren Y.S. Yudkovsky Y. Mahbubani H.M. Weiss A.M. Lebendiker M. Brandeis M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2004; 432: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).Finally, in recent years binding of inhibitors to the co-activator proteins has emerged as an important mode of APC control. Cdc20 is bound and inhibited by the mitotic checkpoint complex containing Mad2, Mad3/BubR1, and Bub3 in response to unattached kinetochores to prevent premature securin degradation and initiation of anaphase (19Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Vertebrate Emi1 binds to both Cdc20 and Cdh1 as well as the APCCdh1 complex and prevents association of APC with substrates from late G1 until early M (20Reimann J.D. Gardner B.E. Margottin-Goguet F.

Fission yeast mes1 protein inhibits the APCCdc20-mediated degradation of mitotic cyclin following meiosis I by blocking substrate binding to Cdc20 (22Izawa D. Goto M. Yamashita A. Yamano H. Yamamoto M. Nature. 2005; 434: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and Erp1/Emi2 is the cytostatic factor responsible for meiosis II arrest in vertebrate eggs by binding Cdc20 and inhibiting APCCdc20 (23Schmidt A.

Nakano Y. Kajikawa E. Perry A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 834-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In many cases, these inhibitors seem to act by preventing association of co-activators or APC-co-activator complexes with their substrates. In the case of Emi1 and Mad3/BubR1, evidence suggests that inhibition occurs via a pseudosubstrate mechanism (21Miller J.J. Summers M.K. Hansen D.V. Nachury M.V. Lehman N.L. Loktev A. Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2410-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in which the inhibitors structurally mimic APC substrates and competitively inhibit binding of true substrates.We recently identified an inhibitor of APCCdh1 in budding yeast called Acm1 (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the specific biological role of Acm1 is still not clear, when overexpressed it can suppress the lethal APCCdh1 activity that results from lack of inhibitory Cdh1 phosphorylation sites and inhibit the function of Cdh1 in promoting mitotic exit (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with Acm1 acting as an inhibitor of mitotic cyclin proteolysis in vivo, and indeed Acm1 inhibits APC-catalyzed ubiquitination of Clb2 in vitro (27Dial J.M. Petrotchenko E.V. Borchers C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5237-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Acm1 is tightly regulated during the mitotic cell cycle, appearing in late G1 and disappearing abruptly in late mitosis, mirroring the window of high CDK activity and APCCdh1 inactivity. This pattern of expression is reminiscent of many APCCdh1 substrates, and Acm1 has conserved sequence elements common to APC substrates, including several destruction boxes (RXXL) and a KEN box (10Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar, 28King R.W. Glotzer M. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These degron sequences are commonly required for substrate recognition and ubiquitination by APC (29Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, we report here that Acm1 proteolysis is actually independent of APC. We show instead that the budding yeast CDK, Cdc28, and the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc14 have opposing roles in regulating the phosphorylation and APC-independent proteolysis of Acm1. Our results reveal an alternative APC-independent mechanism for establishing cell cycle-dependent expression coinciding with the period of high CDK activity, and emphasize the existence of additional late mitotic proteolytic mechanisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Strain Construction, and Mutagenesis—All plasmids used are listed in Table 1. Details of plasmid constructions are available upon request. In general, centromeric expression plasmids were constructed from a common plasmid series (30Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). ACM1-5A and ACM1-5E alleles encoding mutants with alanine (5A) or glutamate (5E) substitutions at the five consensus CDK sequences (residues 3, 31, 48, 102, and 161) and the cdh1-11A allele were generated with the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Individual point mutations in Acm1 were generated using the standard QuikChange kit. pHLP117, expressing 3HA-ACM1 from its natural promoter, was described previously (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To construct pHLP183 expressing Cdc28 from its natural promoter, CDC28 with 350 bp of 5′- and 230 bp of 3′-flanking sequence was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pBM258. pHLP183 complements the temperature sensitivity of a cdc28-4 strain. All constructions involving a PCR step and all site-specific mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Yeast strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSourceW303 background YKA150MATa bar1::URA360 YKA247MATa bar1::URA3 acm1::KanMX426 YKA254MATa acm1::KanMX4This study YKA415MATa bar1::URA3 cdc23-1This study HCY114MATa cdc14-1This study HCY115MATa leu2::GAL-HA-CDC14:LEU2This study HCY116MATa leu2::GAL-HA-CDC14C283S:LEU2This study DLY3033MATa cdc15-2Daniel Lew, Duke University RJD2632MATa cdc28-as1Raymond Deshaies, California Institute of Technology 5397MATa cdc28-4Steven Reed, ScrippsBY4741 background YKA170MATa cdh1::KanMX4 CLB2-3HA:HIS3This study YKA226MATa 3HA-ACM126 YKA242MATa bar1::hisG acm1::URA3 CDH1-3FLAG:KanMX4This study YKA244MATa cdh1::KanMX4This study YKA245MATa bar1::URA3 cdh1::KanMX4 3HA-ACM126 YKA249MATa bar1::hisG 3HA-BMH126 YKA253MATa bar1::hisG acm1::KanMX4This study YKA295MATa bar1::hisG acm1::KanMX4 3FLAG-BMH1This study YKA407MATa bar1::hisG acm1::KanMX4 pdr5::URA3This studyPlasmid nameOriginMarkerPromoterExpressed proteinpHLP101CEN/ARSLEU2ADHHA-Acm1pHLP102CEN/ARSLEU2ADHHA-Acm1-5ApHLP103CEN/ARSLEU2ADHHA-Acm1-5EpHLP107CEN/ARSLEU2ADH3FLAG-Acm1pHLP109CEN/ARSLEU2GAL1HA-Acm1pHLP110CEN/ARSLEU2GAL1HA-Acm1-5ApHLP111CEN/ARSLEU2GAL1HA-Acm1-5EpHLP112CEN/ARSURA3GAL13FLAG-Acm1pHLP113CEN/ARSURA3GAL13FLAG-Acm1-5ApHLP117CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1pHLP130CEN/ARSLEU2ADH3FLAG-Cdh1pHLP135CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-S37ApHLP136CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-S48ApHLP137CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-S102ApHLP138CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-S202ApHLP139CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-T161ApHLP150CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-S3ApHLP169CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-5A/T161pHLP183CEN/ARSURA3CDC28Cdc28pHLP185CEN/ARSLEU2GAL1HA-Acm1-T161ApHLP209CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-5ApHLP212CEN/ARSLEU2GAL13HA-Acm1pHLP222CEN/ARSLEU2ACM13HA-Acm1-5EpHLP231CEN/ARSTRP1GAL13FLAG-Cdh1pHLP232CEN/ARSTRP1GAL13FLAG-Cdh1-11ApESCLeu-mycCDC142 μmLEU2GAL1myc-Cdc14pESCTrp-FIN1myc2 μmTRP1GAL1Fin1-myc Open table in a new tab Yeast strains (Table 1) were engineered by PCR-mediated gene disruption or epitope tag insertion or linearized plasmid integration using standard procedures described elsewhere (31Brachmann C.B.

Deletion strains were confirmed by PCR and tagged strains by PCR, DNA sequencing, and immunoblotting.Protein Purification—Immunoaffinity purification of 3FLAG-Cdh1 and associated proteins has been described (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 3FLAG-Acm1 was purified by the same procedure. Clb2–3HA/Cdc28 was immunoaffinity-purified from extracts of strain YKA170 using anti-HA antibody resin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μm pepstatin, and 100 μm leupeptin. After extensive washing with this buffer, the complex was eluted in kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100) by competition with 100 μg/ml HA peptide (Sigma), adjusted to 40% glycerol, and stored at –20 °C.Recombinant 3FLAG-Acm1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μm pepstatin. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 35,000 × g and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody resin for 2 h. Resin was washed extensively with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3FLAG-Acm1 eluted twice by competition with 250 μg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma). Pooled elutions were flash-frozen in small aliquots and stored at –80 °C. Acm1 concentration was estimated by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels using bovine serum albumin to generate a standard curve.6His-Cdc14 was expressed in E. coli, and cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. Extract was cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap Ni2+ column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and processed with a 100-ml linear gradient from 20 to 300 mm imidazole. Pooled fractions containing 6His-Cdc14 were diluted 1:3 with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, loaded on a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a linear gradient from 10 mm to 1 m NaCl. Peak 6His-Cdc14 fractions were pooled and stored at 4 °C. A Net1 fragment (residues 1–600) with a His6 tag on the C terminus was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described for 6His-Cdc14 and dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Cdc14 and Net1 concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using a bovine serum albumin standard curve.Phosphorylation Site Mapping—SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices containing Acm1 (roughly 0.1–1 μg) were excised, destained, and treated overnight with either 20 μg/ml sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 20 μg/ml Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 1 mm EDTA, or 50 μg/ml Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8) at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted twice with acetonitrile, lyophilized, and resuspended in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid immediately prior to LC/MS-MS analysis.Peptides were separated on an Agilent 1100 capillary HPLC system using Zorbax C18 trap and 75-μm × 150-mm capillary columns. For LC/MALDI, peptides were eluted with a gradient of increasing acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 800 nl/min, mixed 1:1 with 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid supplied by a syringe pump, and spotted in 0.8-μl fractions on a sample plate using an Agilent LC micro spotting system. Fractions were analyzed in positive MS and MS-MS modes on an Applied Biosystems 4700 mass spectrometer. For electrospray LC/MS-MS analysis, peptides were eluted with a gradient of increasing acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 300 nl/min and injected into a Thermo Scientific LTQ ion trap using a nanoelectrospray source.Peptides were initially identified by automated searching of a data base of Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins with either Mascot (Matrix Science) for 4700 data or Sorcerer (Sage-N Research) for LTQ data. All spectra from putative phosphopeptides were then interpreted manually to confirm correct peptide identification and localization of phosphorylated residues.Cell Growth and Immunoblotting—We used standard yeast growth conditions and media. For G1 arrests, α-factor peptide (Genscript Corp.) was used at 5 μg/ml for BAR1 or 50 μg/liter for bar1Δ. Hydroxyurea (HU; Sigma) was used at 10 mg/ml for S arrest, and nocodazole (Sigma) was used at 7.5 μg/ml for BY4741 strains, or 15 μg/ml for W303 strains, for early mitotic arrest. For late mitotic arrests, cdc15-2 or cdc14-1 cells were grown at 23 °C and then shifted to 37 °C. Arrests were confirmed by microscopic examination of cell morphology and in some cases by flow cytometry.G1 block and release experiments (in BAR1 strains) were based on previously published procedures (35Amon, A. (2002) in Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular and Cell Biology (Guthrie, C., and Fink, G. R., eds) pp. 458–460, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar) and performed as described (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Typically, α-factor was added back after 60 min to trap cells in the following G1. For block and release in cdc14-1 strains, cultures were arrested with α-factor at 23 °C and released at 37 °C in pre-warmed medium. Flow cytometry controls were prepared and analyzed as described previously (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The following antibodies were used. Monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 and anti-Myc 9E10 were from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2, rabbit anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and EZview anti-FLAG M2 and anti-HA-7-agarose affinity resins were from Sigma. Goat anti-Cdc28, rabbit anti-Clb2, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse were from GE Healthcare. All immunoblots were developed using ECL Plus reagents (GE Healthcare).Protein Stability Assays—For all protein stability measurements, expression from the GAL1 promoter was induced with 2% galactose in YP-Raf (20g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 2% raffinose), typically for 2 h. Transcription and translation were terminated by addition of glucose (2%) and cycloheximide (0.5–1.0 mg/ml), respectively. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated time points and processed for immunoblot analysis as described previously (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Other details are described in the figure legends. For experiments in the cdc28-as1 strain, cells were first arrested with HU and then treated with 5 μm 1-NM-PP1 ((36Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E.

Using centromeric plasmids, expression from the GAL1 promoter results in only slighter higher Acm1 levels than expression from the natural ACM1 promoter (data not shown). Thus, our experimental conditions closely mimic natural Acm1 levels.Co-immunopurification (co-IP)—Co-IP experiments were performed as described (26Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using co-IP buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA). PMSF (0.5 mm) and pepstatin (1 μm) were added during cell lysis.Phosphatase and Kinase Assays—Kinase assays (25 μl) contained 4 μl of immunoaffinity-purified Clb2–3HA/Cdc28 (or control purification), ∼200 nm recombinant 3FLAG-Acm1, and 1 mm ATP in kinase buffer and were performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphatase assays contained ∼100 nm immunoaffinity-purified 3FLAG-Acm1 from yeast and the indicated concentration of recombinant 6His-Cdc14 in 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and were performed at 30 °C for the indicated time. All reactions were stopped by addition of SDS loading dye, boiled, and processed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels (37:1 cross-linking ratio) using standard Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer. Phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Acm1 species were detected by immunoblotting and distinguished based on differences in electrophoretic mobility.Peptide Competition Assay—Crude Acm1 peptides (154ISLPSFITPPRNSK167) with and without a phosphate on Thr-161 were synthesized by Genscript Corp. and were further purified by reverse phase HPLC, lyophilized, and stored in phosphate-buffered saline. Concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. 3HA-Bmh1 from yeast extracts was immobilized on anti-HA beads and washed extensively with co-IP buffer. Beads were then incubated with different concentrations of the synthetic peptides for 30 min at 30 °C in the same buffer and pelleted by centrifugation, and the dissociation of 3FLAG-Acm1 from 3HA-Bmh1 was monitored by anti-FLAG immunoblotting of the supernatants.RESULTSAcm1 Is a Phosphoprotein and a Substrate of Cdc28—In our initial identification of Acm1 as a Cdh1 interaction partner, a prominent peptide was detected containing phosphorylation at Thr-161. To determine whether Acm1 is phosphorylated in vivo at additional sites, we conducted an extensive tandem MS analysis of purified Acm1. We used several site-specific proteases and both electrospray and MALDI instruments to obtain 100% sequence coverage. Acm1 is phosphorylated on at least nine different residues (Table 2). Three of these, including Thr-161, are part of consensus recognition sequences for CDK ((S/T)PX(K/R)). The same phosphorylation sites were detected in Acm1 from cells arrested in S or late M phases. Two sites, Thr-161 and Ser-202, appeared to be extensively phosphorylated based on comparison of the ion signals for unmodified and phosphorylated peptides during LC/MS analyses (Fig. 1A). The remaining sites appeared to be phosphorylated with relatively low stoichiometry, and phosphorylation was not detected at two additional consensus CDK sequences, including one (Ser-3) that is highly conserved in ACM1 orthologs. Ser-3-containing peptides were either not detected or exhibited very low intensity in all of the MS analyses, leaving open the possibility that it too is phosphorylated.TABLE 2Acm1 phosphopeptides and phosphorylation sites identified by MSPeptide sequenceaConfirmed phosphorylation sites are underlined.Phosphorylation site(s)Detected byMALDIESI37SQIDTDYALR46Ser-37YesYes35RRSQIDTDYALR46Ser-37YesYes35RRSQIDTDYALRRSPIK51Ser-37,bThe peptide containing Ser-37 and Ser-48 phosphorylation was not observed in doubly phosphorylated form.

https://openalex.org/W2069962673,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae RDH54 is a key member of the evolutionarily conserved RAD52 epistasis group of genes needed for homologous recombination and DNA double strand break repair. The RDH54-encoded protein possesses a DNA translocase activity and functions together with the Rad51 recombinase in the D-loop reaction. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that Rdh54 is recruited, in a manner that is dependent on Rad51 and Rad52, to a site-specific DNA double strand break induced by the HO endonuclease. Because of its relatedness to Swi2/Snf2 chromatin remodelers, we have asked whether highly purified Rdh54 possesses chromatin-remodeling activity. Importantly, our results show that Rdh54 can mobilize a mononucleosome along DNA and render nucleosomal DNA accessible to a restriction enzyme, indicative of a chromatin-remodeling function. Moreover, Rdh54 co-operates with Rad51 in the utilization of naked or chromatinized DNA as template for D-loop formation. We also provide evidence for a strict dependence of the chromatin-remodeling attributes of Rdh54 on its ATPase activity and N-terminal domain. Interestingly, an N-terminal deletion mutant (rdh54Δ102) is unable to promote Rad51-mediated D-loop formation with a chromatinized template, while retaining substantial activity with naked DNA. These features of Rdh54 suggest a role of this protein factor in chromatin rearrangement during DNA recombination and repair.

These features of Rdh54 suggest a role of this protein factor in chromatin rearrangement during DNA recombination and repair. The genomic DNA in eukaryotic cells is organized into chromatin, which harbors repeated nucleosome units each comprising an octamer of four histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and 147 bp of DNA (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6841) Google Scholar, 2Richmond T.J. Davey C.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The folding of DNA on the surface of histone proteins within the nucleosome inevitably poses an accessibility problem during various DNA transactions, including DNA replication, recombination, and repair. One mechanism to efficiently overcome this structural hindrance is by an ATP hydrolysis-dependent chromatin-remodeling process, such that remodeling proteins render DNA more accessible by weakening DNA:histone contacts, sliding nucleosomes along DNA, or removing H2A-H2B dimers from the nucleosome (3Becker P.B.

We are interested in delineating the mechanism of homologous recombination (HR) 2The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DSB, double strand break; RSC, remodel the structure of chromatin. 2The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DSB, double strand break; RSC, remodel the structure of chromatin. that is mediated by proteins of the RAD52 epistasis group, including how the HR machinery negotiates the constraints posed by chromatin structure. Regarding the latter, of special interest are two key members of the RAD52 epistasis group, Rad54 and Rdh54 proteins. These HR factors play multifaceted roles in HR (6Sung P. Trujillo K.M.

Rad54 and Rdh54 both possess a DNA-dependent ATPase activity and a dsDNA translocase function that is fueled by ATP hydrolysis (8Heyer W.D. Li X. Rolfsmeier M. Zhang X.P.

Remarkably, Rad54 and Rdh54 also catalyze the removal of Rad51 from dsDNA, an attribute that is likely important for the intracellular recycling of Rad51 and for freeing the primer end in the nascent D-loop structure from Rad51 to facilitate the initiation of repair DNA synthesis (8Heyer W.D.

Based on cytological and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, it has been suggested that Rdh54 and Rad54 also function to release the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 from bulk chromatin (21Holzen T.M. Shah P.P. Olivares H.A. Bishop D.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2593-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importantly, and consistent with its relatedness to the Swi2/Snf2 family of chromatin remodelers, Rad54 protein has a chromatin-remodeling function that is fueled by its ATPase activity (22Alexeev A.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Rad54 also works with Rad51 to promote the formation of D-loops with a chromatinized template (23Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol.

Here, we provide evidence that, like Rad54 and several other Swi2/Snf2 family members, Rdh54 possesses a chromatin-remodeling activity whose functionality is reliant on ATP hydrolysis. We show that Rdh54 works in conjunction with Rad51 to mediate D-loop formation with chromatinized DNA. Interestingly, in addition to its involvement in complex formation with Rad51, the conserved N-terminal region of Rdh54 is needed for maximal efficiency in chromatin remodeling as well. We have also employed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to demonstrate the Rad51/Rad52-dependent delivery of Rdh54 protein to a site-specific DSB. Our results contribute toward dissecting the multifaceted role of Rdh54 in HR and DNA repair. ChIP Assay—The ChIP procedure was carried out essentially as described (27Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). All the yeast strains used are isogenic to JKM179 strain (Δho Δhml::ADE1 MATα Δhmr::ADE1 ade1–110 leu2,3–112 lys5 trp1::hisG ura3–52 ade3::GAL10:HO), which harbors the HO gene under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL10 promoter. A sequence that codes for a triple FLAG tag was attached to the 3′-end of the chromosomal RDH54 gene to facilitate the immunoprecipitation of Rdh54 by commercially available anti-FLAG antibodies. NatMX was used as the selectable marker in the deletion of RAD51, RAD52, and RDH54. Cells were grown in YP containing 3% glycerol to reach mid-log phase, and then galactose (2%) was added to induce the HO endonuclease. At the designated times, an aliquot (45 ml) of the cell culture was treated with formaldehyde (1%) for 20 min and then quenched with 125 mm glycine for 5 min. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with anti-Rad51 or anti-Rad52 antibodies (our own laboratory stocks) and protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) or with anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and then incubated at 65 °C to reverse protein-DNA cross-links. Radioactive semiquantitative PCR was performed to amplify the MAT Z locus and the PHO5 sequence, which was included as the internal control (27Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel, the PCR products were quantified in a Personal FX phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). The MAT Z signal at each time point was divided by the corresponding PHO5 signal and normalized to the 0-h signal. Protein Purification—Rad51 was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells tailored to overexpress the recombinase, as described (28Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rdh54 and its mutant variants were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen), as described (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol.

RSC was purified from extracts of yeast cells that harbor chromosomally tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged RSC2 (which codes for a subunit of RSC), as described (29Wittmeyer J. Saha A. Cairns B. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 322-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Preparation of Chromatinized DNA—Nucleosomal arrays were assembled with pBluescript SK II DNA, and the histone octamer was purified from the nuclei of chicken erythrocytes (30Stein A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 585-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by the salt dialysis method, as described previously (24Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J.

For the construction of the mononucleosome substrates, a 314-bp DNA fragment derived from the RAD51 gene promoter was generated by PCR using plasmid pN124 as template (22Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment was purified with the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The mononucleosome was assembled using the purified chicken histone octamer and the 314-bp DNA by salt dialysis, and the N1 and N3 species were isolated from preparative polyacrylamide gels, as described (22Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). D-loop Formation on Naked and Chromatinized DNA Templates—D-loop reactions were performed essentially as described in our published work (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51973-51980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Rad51 presynaptic filament was assembled by incubating a 32P-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide (2.4 μm nucleotides) and Rad51 (0.8 μm) in buffer D (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system comprising 20 μg/ml creatine kinase and 20 mm creatine phosphate) for 5 min at 37 °C. The indicated amounts of Rdh54 protein, one of the rdh54 mutant proteins, or RSC and free or the chromatinized form of pBluescript (35 μm base pairs) were then added to the reaction, which was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were deproteinized with SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA). The gels were dried onto DE81 paper (Whatman), and the radiolabeled DNA species were visualized and quantified in a phosphorimaging apparatus (Personal Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad) with the aid of Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The reactions with RecA used 1 μm of the recombinase and were assembled, processed, and analyzed as above. The percentage of D-loop refers to the fraction of the 32P-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide substrate being converted into the D-loop. HaeIII Accessibility Test for Chromatin Remodeling—The chromatinized pBluescript SK II DNA (35 μm base pairs) was mixed with the indicated amounts of Rdh54, one of the rdh54 mutant proteins, or RSC and HaeIII (10 units) in 12.5 μl of buffer D, followed by a 30-min incubation at 30 °C. Where indicated, Rad51 and the 90-mer DNA (at a ratio of 3 nucleotides/Rad51 monomer) used in the D-loop reaction were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the reaction buffer prior to incorporating the chromatinized DNA, test protein, and HaeIII. After deproteinizing treatment, as above, the reaction mixtures were resolved in a 1.5% agarose gel, and the DNA species were stained with ethidium bromide. Nucleosome Mobilization Test—The mononucleosome substrates (0.8 nm) were incubated with the indicated amounts of Rdh54 or one of the rdh54 mutant proteins in 12.5 μl of buffer D at 30 °C for 1 h. Where indicated, Rad51 and the 90-mer DNA (at a ratio of 3 nucleotides/Rad51 monomer) used in the D-loop reaction were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the reaction buffer prior to incorporating the substrate and test protein. Following the addition of ϕX174 replicative form DNA (121 μm base pairs, ∼90% supercoiled form), the reaction mixtures were resolved in 4% polyacrylamide gels in TB buffer (45 mm Trisborate, pH 8.3). The gels were dried and subject to phosphorimaging analysis, as above. Rad51/Rad52-dependent DSB Recruitment of Rdh54—ChIP has been employed to demonstrate the recruitment of various HR factors, including Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54, to a site-specific DSB that is induced by the HO endonuclease at the MAT locus located on chromosome 3 (27Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). ChIP was used in our study to test whether Rdh54 is similarly targeted to the HO-made DSB. The ChIP experiments involved the use of isogenic wild-type, rad51Δ, rad52Δ, and rdh54Δ yeast strains that harbor the HO gene whose expression is inducible by the addition of galactose to the growth medium. For the immunoprecipitation of HR proteins, we used affinity-purified polyclonal anti-Rad51 and anti-Rad52 antibodies that we had raised and attached a triple FLAG tag to the C terminus of the chromosomally expressed Rdh54 protein to allow for the use of commercially available anti-FLAG antibody in Rdh54 immunoprecipitation. We first verified that the kinetics and extent of DSB induction were the same in all the yeast strains (Fig. 1A). We then carried out the requisite ChIP experiments to examine the targeting of the aforementioned HR proteins to the MAT Z sequence that is proximal to the HO break and also to ask whether the DSB targeting of Rad51 and Rad52 are in any way affected by Rdh54, and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 1B, Rdh54 became highly enriched at the HO break, by 10 fold one hour after HO endonuclease induction, reaching the maximum of 20 fold enrichment two to three hours after HO induction. The DSB targeting of Rdh54 was greatly diminished, but not completely abolished, in the isogenic rad51Δ and rad52Δ strains. In agreement with the published results (27Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), both Rad51 and Rad52 proteins were recruited to the DSB (Fig. 1C). The recruitment of Rad51 or Rad52 to the HO break was not significantly altered in the absence of Rdh54. Thus, the ChIP data indicate that Rdh54 is recruited to DSBs in a Rad51/Rad52-dependent manner and suggest that the timely DSB recruitment of Rad51 and Rad52 does not rely upon Rdh54. Rdh54 Enhances the Restriction Enzyme Accessibility of Nucleosomal DNA—We first employed a restriction endonuclease accessibility test to ask whether Rdh54 can remodel chromatin structure. For this, we assembled a nucleosomal array on plasmid DNA to use as substrate. Owing to the presence of phased nucleosomes, the DNA in the substrate is rather resistant to the restriction enzyme HaeIII, and restructuring of the array by chromatin remodelers is conveniently revealed by an increased HaeIII accessibility (Fig. 2A) (23Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Kwon Y. Chi P. Roh D.H. Klein H. Sung P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, Rdh54 enhanced the HaeIII accessibility of the nucleosomal array, with the degree of accessibility being dependent on the concentration of Rdh54 (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the ability of Rdh54 to remodel the nucleosomal array is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis, we either omitted ATP from the reaction or substituted the wild-type protein with the ATP hydrolysis-defective K352R variant. In either case, there was no change in the accessibility of the array DNA to HaeIII (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the results provide the first evidence for an ATP hydrolysis-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity in Rdh54. Nucleosome Sliding by Rdh54—A number of chromatin remodelers have the ability to reposition a mononucleosome (22Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 33Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Biopolymers. 2003; 68: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To examine whether Rdh54 possesses such activity, we utilized a nucleosome sliding assay with substrates that harbor a mononucleosome positioned either near one of the ends (N1) or the center (N3) of a 32P-labeled 314-bp DNA fragment. N1 and N3 have very different mobilities in a native polyacrylamide gel, with the former being the faster migrating species (Fig. 3A). Two types of restructuring of the mononucleosome substrates by chromatin remodelers are possible: 1) simple repositioning of the nucleosome in the substrates will generate novel species that have a gel mobility different than that of either N1 or N3, and 2) eviction of the nucleosome will produce free DNA that migrates at the gel front. As shown in Fig. 3 (B and C), incubation of the N1 and N3 mononucleosome substrates with Rdh54 in the presence of ATP led to the generation of multiple novel mononucleosome species (designated, collectively, as N2) and a significant amount of free DNA, providing evidence for a nucleosome sliding activity in Rdh54. However, given the inherent limitations of the experimental design, we might have underestimated the level of nucleosome removal from the substrate DNA. Consistent with the results from the restriction enzyme accessibility assay (Fig. 2), Rdh54-mediated nucleosome repositioning is strictly dependent on ATP hydrolysis, because 1) the omission of ATP inactivated the efficacy of Rdh54 (data not shown) and 2) the ATPase-defective rdh54 K352R mutant protein was inactive in the reaction (Figs. 2C and 3B). The above results allowed us to conclude that Rdh54 catalyzes ATP hydrolysis-dependent nucleosome sliding. Rdh54 Co-operates with Rad51 in D-loop Formation with Chromatinized DNA—Having demonstrated a chromatin-remodeling activity in Rdh54 (Figs. 2 and 3), we asked whether Rad51 and Rdh54 would catalyze D-loop formation with a chromatinized DNA template. To do this, the Rad51 presynaptic filament was incubated, with or without Rdh54, with homologous dsDNA that was either naked or pre-assembled into a nucleosomal array. As reported before (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and reiterated here, with naked dsDNA, Rdh54 greatly enhanced the ability of the Rad51 presynaptic filament to form D-loops (Fig. 4, B–D and F). Importantly, Rdh54 also rendered D-loop formation with the chromatinized DNA robust, such that the yield of D-loops with the nucleosomal substrate was comparable to that obtained with naked DNA (Fig. 4, B–D and F). Control experiments showed that Rdh54 alone is devoid of D-loop forming ability (Fig. 4B) (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As expected, the E. coli RecA protein was adept at D-loop formation with naked DNA but not chromatinized DNA (Fig. 4, E and F), and the inclusion of Rdh54 had no effect on the ability of RecA to make D-loops with either naked or chromatinized DNA (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, the Rad51-Rdh54 pair can catalyze efficient D-loop formation even when the dsDNA partner is chromatinized. Other results confirmed that the D-loop reaction catalyzed by Rad51 and Rdh54 requires ATP hydrolysis by Rdh54, because the rdh54 K352R protein was inactive in this regard (data not shown). The Chromatin Remodeler RSC Does Not Promote the D-loop Reaction—The above results have provided clear evidence for a chromatin-remodeling activity in Rdh54 (Figs. 2 and 3) and for functional synergy between Rad51 and Rdh54 in D-loop formation with chromatinized DNA (Fig. 4). The fact that Rdh54 does not enable RecA to catalyze D-loop formation with chromatinized DNA (data not shown) suggests that the stimulatory effect of Rdh54 is specific to Rad51. To further ascertain the specificity of the observed functional synergy between Rad51 and Rdh54, we purified RSC2 complex, a known chromatin remodeler (36Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Du J. Laurent B. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1249-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A), and used it together with Rad51 in D-loop reactions that employed either naked or chromatinized DNA as template. As shown in Fig. 5B, the purified complex was able to remodel chromatinized DNA and enhance HaeIII accessibility (Fig. 5B). However, RSC was unable to substitute for Rdh54 in D-loop reactions, regardless of whether naked or chromatinized DNA was used (Fig. 5C). Thus, the ability of Rad51 and Rdh54 to mediate D-loop formation with chromatinized DNA is in all likelihood contingent upon not only the chromatin-remodeling activity of Rdh54, but also on specific complex formation of Rdh54 with Rad51. Role of the Conserved Rdh54 N Terminus in Chromatin Remodeling—In Rdh54, the Swi2/Snf2 core concerned with DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis is separate from the N-terminal 280 or so residues of the protein (37Durr H. Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Hopfner K.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4160-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Shinohara M. Shita-Yamaguchi E. Buerstedde J.M. Shinagawa H. Ogawa H. Shinohara A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension appears to be conserved among Rdh54 orthologues (39Tanaka K. Kagawa W. Kinebuchi T. Kurumizaka H. Miyagawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test the idea that the Rdh54 N-terminal domain might be involved in the interaction with factors important for HR, we previously constructed N-terminally truncated variants (Δ34, Δ102, and Δ133) of this protein and provided evidence that 1) all three truncation mutants retain the biochemical attributes (DNA binding, ATPase, and DNA translocase activities) of the full-length protein, 2) the rdh54 Δ34 mutant protein retains the ability to interact and functionally synergize with Rad51, and 3) the rdh54 Δ102 mutant protein is slightly compromised for Rad51 binding and functional synergy with Rad51, but the rdh54 Δ133 mutant is severely impaired in these regards (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We used the HaeIII accessibility and the mononucleosome repositioning assays described earlier to test whether the three N-terminal truncation mutations affect the chromatin-remodeling activity of Rdh54. In the HaeIII accessibility test, rdh54 Δ34 showed a slightly diminished level of activity compared with full-length Rdh54, whereas rdh54 Δ102 and rdh54 Δ133 appeared to be defective (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, all three N-terminally truncated rdh54 mutant proteins displayed little or no activity in the mononucleosome repositioning assay (Fig. 6B). Thus, the results reveal an involvement of the conserved N terminus of Rdh54 in the chromatin remodeling function of this HR factor. The Rdh54 N Terminus Is Indispensable for D-loop Formation with Chromatinized DNA—We next ascertained the impact that the N-terminal truncation mutations have on the ability of Rdh54 to promote Rad51-mediated D-loop formation with chromatinized DNA. Consistent with previously published results (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), when naked dsDNA was used as substrate, we saw a slightly attenuated ability of the rdh54 Δ34 and rdh54 Δ102 proteins but a complete defect in the rdh54 Δ133 mutant to promote D-loop formation (Fig. 7). Interestingly, with chromatinized dsDNA, although the rdh54 Δ34 mutant protein retained a significant level of activity, neither the Δ102 nor the Δ133 variant was efficacious (Fig. 7). Rad51 Does Not Enhance Chromatin Remodeling by Rdh54—Published results have shown that Rad51 to stimulates ATPase, DNA supercoiling, and DNA strand opening activities of Rdh54 (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We asked whether Rad51 similarly enhances the chromatin-remodeling function of Rdh54. However, we could find little or no such enhancement in either the HaeIII accessibility test (Fig. 8, A and B) or the mononucleosome repositioning assay (Fig. 8, C and D). Studies by several laboratories, including ours, have found a DNA translocase activity in Rdh54 protein (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Prasad T.K. Robertson R.B. Visnapuu M.L. Chi P. Sung P. Greene E.C. J. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), facilitate DNA strand invasion by Rad51 (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H.

Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Holzen T.M. Shah P.P. Olivares H.A. Bishop D.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2593-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with its relatedness to the Swi2/Snf2 family of chromatin remodelers, including the HR protein Rad54 (22Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the use of two well established assay systems in this study have allowed us to conclude that Rdh54 possesses a chromatin-remodeling activity as well. As in the case of other Swi2/Snf2-like remodelers, chromatin remodeling by Rdh54 is fueled by ATP hydrolysis, such that the rdh54 K352R variant, lacking ATPase activity, is completely defective in this regard. Previous work by us has demonstrated an involvement of the N terminus of Rdh54 in mediating complex formation with Rad51 (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The data presented here reveal that this conserved N-terminal region is also indispensable for chromatin remodeling. Specifically, deletion of the first 34 residues in Rdh54, while having no noticeable effect on Rad51 binding (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), ablates the ability of Rdh54 to reposition a mononucleosome. Moreover, even though the rdh54 Δ102 mutant is only slightly impaired for Rad51 binding (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is functionally defective in either the nucleosome array accessibility assay or the mononucleosome repositioning test. We note that deletion of as few as the first nine residues from the N terminus of the Drosophila melanogaster Rad54 protein adversely affects its chromatin-remodeling function (40Alexiadis V. Lusser A. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27824-27829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas a much larger N-terminal truncation (Δ129) in the S. cerevisiae Rad54 protein does not seem to have a significant impact in this regard (31Raschle M. Van Komen S. Chi P. Ellenberger T. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51973-51980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether the N terminus of ScRdh54 and DmRad54 share a common attribute that is critical for their chromatin remodeling function. Aside from demonstrating a chromatin-remodeling activity in Rdh54, we have furnished evidence that this Swi2/Snf2-like factor functionally synergizes with Rad51 in the formation of D-loops with chromatinized DNA. Importantly, the noted synergy between Rad51 and Rdh54 is highly specific, because Rdh54 neither enhances the D-forming ability of the heterologous recombinase RecA (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) nor enables RecA to make D-loops with chromatinized DNA. Furthermore, the S. cerevisiae chromatin remodeler RSC, a multisubunit complex that harbors the Swi2/Snf2-like motor protein Sth1, is ineffective in the D-loop reaction with Rad51, regardless of whether naked or chromatinized DNA is employed. According to our published work (19Chi P. Kwon Y. Seong C. Epshtein A. Lam I. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26268-26279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we would like to suggest that the functional synergy of Rad51 and Rdh54 in the DNA strand invasion reaction that involves chromatin stems from a specific interaction between the two HR factors. By cytology, Lisby et al. (41Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) have found co-localization of Rdh54 with a variety of HR proteins in nuclear foci upon treatment of yeast cells with ionizing radiation. The targeting of Rdh54 to these DNA damage-induced foci is dependent upon Rad51 and Rad52 (41Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Consistent with these cytological data, we have shown by ChIP that Rdh54 is recruited to the HO-made DSB at the MAT locus. Importantly, DSB targeting of Rdh54 is strongly attenuated in rad51Δ and rad52Δ cells. These results, together with the cytological data of Lisby et al. (41Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), help establish that Rdh54 is recruited to DNA lesions and that the recruitment process is largely dependent on Rad51 and Rad52. Aside from its involvement in HR and DNA repair reactions, Rdh54 is important for chromosome segregation in meiosis I. In its meiotic role, it is thought that Rdh54 cooperates with the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 in the mediation of inter-homologue recombination that links the chromosome homologues to allow for the proper alignment of the homologues on the spindle apparatus and their faithful disjunction in the first meiotic division (38Shinohara M.

Rev. 2002; 66 (table of contents): 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The research material and methodology that we and others have described (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H.

https://openalex.org/W2030297321,"Sebaleic acid (5,8-octadecadienoic acid) is the major polyunsaturated fatty acid in human sebum and skin surface lipids. The objective of the present study was to investigate the metabolism of this fatty acid by human neutrophils and to determine whether its metabolites are biologically active. Neutrophils converted sebaleic acid to four major products, which were identified by their chromatographic properties, UV absorbance, and mass spectra as 5-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5-HODE), 5-oxo-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5-oxo-ODE), 5S,18-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid, and 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid. The identities of these metabolites were confirmed by comparison of their properties with those of authentic chemically synthesized standards. Both neutrophils and human keratinocytes converted 5-HODE to 5-oxo-ODE. This reaction was stimulated in neutrophils by phorbol myristate acetate and in keratinocytes by oxidative stress (t-butyl-hydroperoxide). Both treatments dramatically elevated intracellular levels of NADP+, the cofactor required by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase. In keratinocytes, this was accompanied by a rapid increase in intracellular GSSG levels, consistent with the involvement of glutathione peroxidase. 5-Oxo-ODE stimulated calcium mobilization in human neutrophils and induced desensitization to 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid but not leukotriene B4, indicating that this effect was mediated by the OXE receptor. 5-Oxo-ODE and its 8-trans isomer were equipotent with 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid in stimulating actin polymerization and chemotaxis in human neutrophils, whereas 5-HODE, 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid, and 5S,18-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid were much less active. We conclude that neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase converts sebaleic acid to 5-HODE, which can be further metabolized to 5-oxo-ODE by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase in neutrophils and keratinocytes. Because of its chemoattractant properties, sebum-derived 5-oxo-ODE could be involved in neutrophil infiltration in inflammatory skin diseases. Sebaleic acid (5,8-octadecadienoic acid) is the major polyunsaturated fatty acid in human sebum and skin surface lipids. The objective of the present study was to investigate the metabolism of this fatty acid by human neutrophils and to determine whether its metabolites are biologically active. Neutrophils converted sebaleic acid to four major products, which were identified by their chromatographic properties, UV absorbance, and mass spectra as 5-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5-HODE), 5-oxo-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5-oxo-ODE), 5S,18-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid, and 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid. The identities of these metabolites were confirmed by comparison of their properties with those of authentic chemically synthesized standards. Both neutrophils and human keratinocytes converted 5-HODE to 5-oxo-ODE. This reaction was stimulated in neutrophils by phorbol myristate acetate and in keratinocytes by oxidative stress (t-butyl-hydroperoxide). Both treatments dramatically elevated intracellular levels of NADP+, the cofactor required by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase. In keratinocytes, this was accompanied by a rapid increase in intracellular GSSG levels, consistent with the involvement of glutathione peroxidase. 5-Oxo-ODE stimulated calcium mobilization in human neutrophils and induced desensitization to 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid but not leukotriene B4, indicating that this effect was mediated by the OXE receptor. 5-Oxo-ODE and its 8-trans isomer were equipotent with 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid in stimulating actin polymerization and chemotaxis in human neutrophils, whereas 5-HODE, 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid, and 5S,18-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid were much less active. We conclude that neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase converts sebaleic acid to 5-HODE, which can be further metabolized to 5-oxo-ODE by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase in neutrophils and keratinocytes. Because of its chemoattractant properties, sebum-derived 5-oxo-ODE could be involved in neutrophil infiltration in inflammatory skin diseases. Human sebaceous glands and the sebum they produce have a unique fatty acid profile in that they contain high levels of the Δ6 C16 fatty acid sapienic acid along with its Δ5,8 elongation product sebaleic acid (1Stewart M.E. Downing D.T. Pochi P.E. Strauss J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Nicolaides N. Science. 1974; 186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Sapienic acid is formed by the action of fatty acid desaturase-2 on palmitic acid (3Ge L. Gordon J.S. Hsuan C. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 707-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although this enzyme is widely distributed, it does not normally act on palmitic acid but rather on linoleic acid or α-linolenic acid, which are much better substrates. However, only very small amounts of these polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 3The abbreviations used are: PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid(s); 13-HODE, 13S-hydroxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid; 5,18-diHODE, 5S,18-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; 5-HEDH, 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase; 5-HETE, 5S-hydroxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid; 5-, 5S-, and 5R-HODE, 5-, 5S-, and 5R-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid, respectively; 5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase; 5-oxo-18-HODE, 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid; LTB4, leukotriene B4; 5-oxo-ODE, 5-oxo-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FTMS, Fourier transform mass spectrometry; ODS, octadecylsilyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RP, reversed-phase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; sebaleic acid, (5Z,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; tBuOOH, tert-butyl-hydroperoxide; ME, methyl ester. 3The abbreviations used are: PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid(s); 13-HODE, 13S-hydroxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid; 5,18-diHODE, 5S,18-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; 5-HEDH, 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase; 5-HETE, 5S-hydroxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid; 5-, 5S-, and 5R-HODE, 5-, 5S-, and 5R-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid, respectively; 5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase; 5-oxo-18-HODE, 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid; LTB4, leukotriene B4; 5-oxo-ODE, 5-oxo-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FTMS, Fourier transform mass spectrometry; ODS, octadecylsilyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RP, reversed-phase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; sebaleic acid, (5Z,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid; tBuOOH, tert-butyl-hydroperoxide; ME, methyl ester. are found in sebaceous glands, which instead accumulate high levels of palmitic acid. This is possibly due to the preferential removal of linoleic acid by β-oxidation in this tissue (4Pappas A. Anthonavage M. Gordon J.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 164-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), leaving palmitic acid as the only substrate for fatty acid desaturase-2. Elongation of sapienic acid and insertion of a 5,6-double bond by Δ5-desaturase (fatty acid desaturase-1) results in the formation of sebaleic acid ((5Z,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid) (5Thody A.J. Shuster S. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 383-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which, although present in relatively small amounts, is the major PUFA in human skin surface lipids, being present at levels over 2-fold higher than linoleic acid ((9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid) (2Nicolaides N. Science. 1974; 186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Although sapienic acid has been reported to have antibacterial activities (6Wille J.J. Kydonieus A. Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol. 2003; 16: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), nothing is known about the possible role of sebaleic acid in the skin. One possible route for the oxidative metabolism of sebaleic acid is the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway. 5-LO converts the ω6 PUFA arachidonic acid (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) to 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and leukotrienes (7Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, these intermediates are rapidly converted to leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, and 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), respectively (8Borgeat P. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Since sebaleic acid is a Δ5,8-PUFA like arachidonic acid, we hypothesized that it might be a substrate for 5-LO and could possibly be converted to an analogous 5-hydroxy metabolite, although further conversion to leukotrienes would not be possible due to the lack of a Δ11-double bond. Although 5-HETE has only weak biological activities on neutrophils and eosinophils, it is oxidized to the potent granulocyte chemoattractant 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) by the NADP+-dependent enzyme 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase (5-HEDH) (9Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological actions of this compound are mediated by the highly selective OXE receptor (10Powell W.S. Rokach J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 154-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Brink C. Dahlen S.E. Drazen J. Evans J.F. Hay D.W. Rovati G.E. Serhan C.N. Shimizu T. Yokomizo T. Pharmacol.

Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Jones C.E. Holden S. Tenaillon L. Bhatia U. Seuwen K. Tranter P. Turner J. Kettle R. Bouhelal R. Charlton S. Nirmala N.R.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 3345-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The objective of the current study was to determine whether sebaleic acid is a substrate for the 5-LO pathway and whether it can be converted to biologically active proinflammatory products that could potentially be involved in attracting granulocytes to the skin. Materials—5-Oxo-ETE (15Khanapure S.P. Shi X.X. Powell W.S. Rokach J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 337-342Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and LTB4 (16Zamboni R. Rokach J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1982; 23: 2631-2634Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were prepared by chemical synthesis as described previously. 13S-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) was prepared by oxidation of linoleic acid with soybean lipoxygenase Type 1B (Sigma) (17Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following were purchased from Sigma: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (tBuOOH), GSH, GSSG, o-phthalaldehyde, acetophenone, formic acid, deamino-NAD+, tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide, and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-pro-panesulfonate (CHAPS). Me2SO was purchased from Fisher, whereas NADP+ and A23187 were from Roche Applied Science and Calbiochem, respectively. Ionomycin was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and Indo-1 was obtained from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Chemical Synthesis of Sebaleic Acid and Its 5-Hydroxy and 5-Oxo Derivatives—Sebaleic acid (Fig. 1A), 5S-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5S-HODE; Fig. 1B), 5S,18-dihydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5,18-diHODE; Fig. 1C), 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5-oxo-18-HODE; Fig. 1C), 5-oxo-(6E,8Z)-octadecadienoic acid (5-oxo-ODE; Fig. 1D), and 5-oxo-(6E,8E)-octadecadienoic acid (8-trans-5-oxo-ODE; Fig. 1E) were prepared by total chemical synthesis as illustrated in Fig. 1. 5R-HODE was prepared as described for 5S-HODE (Fig. 1B), except that the starting material was l-arabinose rather than d-arabinose. Although Ludwig and Sprecher (18Ludwig S.A. Sprecher H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) previously reported the total synthesis of 14C-labeled sebaleic acid, no chemical syntheses have previously been reported for the other compounds listed above. The above products were stored at –80 °C until used. Sebaleic acid was repurified by RP-HPLC within 1 week of its use to remove any autoxidation products, whereas the oxygenated derivatives of sebaleic acid were repurified by RP-HPLC within 1 month of use. The detailed experimental conditions for these syntheses will be published separately. Preparation of Neutrophils—Neutrophils were prepared by treatment of whole blood with Dextran T-500 (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min, followed by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) and hypotonic lysis of any remaining red blood cells (9Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neutrophils were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS–). Culture of Human Keratinocytes—Normal human keratinocytes were obtained from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and cultured in serum-free EpiLife® medium containing EpiLife defined growth supplement (Cascade Biologics) according to the supplier's directions. Cells were seeded at a density of 2500 cells/cm2 and grown to 80% confluence, with the medium being changed every 2 days. The cells were used until passage 6 or 7. Analysis of Metabolites of Sebaleic Acid and 5-HODE—Neutrophils (2 × 106 cells in 1 ml) were suspended in PBS– supplemented with 1.8 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ (PBS+) and incubated for various times with either sebaleic acid, 5-HODE, or 5-oxo-ODE in the presence or absence of A23187 (5 μm) or PMA (50 nm). Incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol (0.65 ml) containing 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid and cooling to 0 °C. Keratinocytes were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2500 cells/cm2 as described above. When they reached 70–80% confluence, the medium was removed and replaced with PBS+ (1 ml), and the cells were incubated for different times with 5-HODE (4 μm) in the presence or absence of tBuOOH (100 μm). The medium was then removed, the internal standard (120 ng of 13-HODE) was added, and the wells were washed with 0.65 ml of MeOH, which was combined with the aqueous medium. The concentration of methanol in each sample was then adjusted to 30% by the addition of water. Eicosanoids were analyzed by precolumn extraction/RP-HPLC (19Powell W.S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using a Waters Alliance system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Products were quantitated by comparing the areas of their peaks of UV absorbance at their λmax with that of the internal standard. The extinction coefficients of 5-HODE and 5,18-di-HODE at 235 nm were assumed to be identical to that of 5-HETE (27,000), whereas those of 5-oxo-ODE and 5-oxo-18-HODE at 280 nm were assumed to be identical to that of 5-oxo-ETE (22,100). The extinction coefficients used for LTB4 and 13-HODE were 39,500 (280 nm) and 23,000 (235 nm). Measurement of Glutathione in Keratinocytes—GSH and GSSG were measured by RP-HPLC as described previously (20Erlemann K.R. Cossette C. Gravel S. Stamatiou P.B. Lee G.J. Rokach J. Powell W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by modification of a postcolumn derivatization procedure in the literature (21Parmentier C. Leroy P. Wellman M. Nicolas A. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 719: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After incubation of keratinocytes with tBuOOH for various times in 6-well plates at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and 200 mm phosphoric acid (1 ml) containing 12 mm CHAPS at 0 °C was added. GSH and GSSG were separated by RP-HPLC, and each was converted to an identical isoindole adduct by in-line treatment of the column eluate with o-phthalaldehyde, followed by quantitation using a fluorescence detector. The amounts of GSH and GSSG were determined from a standard curve using the authentic compounds as external standards. Measurement of NADP+ in Neutrophils and Keratinocytes—NADP+ was measured after conversion to a fluorescent naphthyridine derivative followed by quantitation by RP-HPLC, as previously described (20Erlemann K.R. Cossette C. Gravel S. Stamatiou P.B. Lee G.J. Rokach J. Powell W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Neutrophils (2 × 106 cells in 250 μl) were incubated for various times with PMA (50 nm). The incubations were terminated with acetophenone/KOH containing deamino-NAD+ (30 ng) as an internal standard. Alternatively, keratinocytes were cultured in 6-well plates and incubated with tBuOOH (100 μm). After various times, the medium was removed and added to acetophenone/KOH. After treatment with formic acid, extraction, and treatment with phenazine methosulfate, the samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC on an Ultracarb ODS column using a fluorescence detector as described previously (20Erlemann K.R. Cossette C. Gravel S. Stamatiou P.B. Lee G.J. Rokach J. Powell W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Identification of Sebaleic Acid Metabolites by Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS)—Neutrophils (108 cells in 20 ml) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with sebaleic acid (50 μm) in the presence of PMA (50 nm) and A23187 (5 μm). The incubation was terminated by the addition of methanol to give a final concentration of 30%, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to solid-phase extraction on a cartridge containing octadecylsilyl silica (C18 Sep-Pak; Waters), as previously described (22Powell W.S. Prostaglandins. 1980; 20: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), except that the sample was loaded in 30% MeOH at neutral pH. The products were purified by RP-HPLC on a Spherisorb ODS-2 column (250 × 4.6 mm; 5-μm particle size; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a mobile phase consisting of 51% acetonitrile in water containing 0.02% acetic acid at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. Metabolites I and II had tR values of 27 and 39 min, respectively, under these conditions. To obtain metabolites III and IV, 5-HODE (4 μm) or 5-oxo-ODE (4 μm), respectively, were incubated with neutrophils (5 × 107 cells in 10 ml) for 40 min at 37 °C. The products were extracted by solid-phase extraction as described above and purified by RP-HPLC on a Spherisorb ODS-2 column using a mobile phase consisting of 40% acetonitrile containing 0.02% acetic acid and a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min The tR values for metabolites III and IV were 12 and 16 min, respectively. Metabolites I–IV were identified by direct infusion electrospray ionization in negative ion mode, using an IonSpec 7.0-tesla Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Lake Forest, CA) calibrated with poly(ethylene glycol) diacid 600 (Fluka). A Z-spray source from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA) was used with a capillary voltage of 2800 V, a cone voltage of 30 V, and a sample flow rate of 1–3 μl/min. The solvent used was a 2:1 mixture of 90% MeOH containing 25 mm ammonium acetate and CH2Cl2. The elemental compositions of the four metabolites were determined by mass spectrometry, and the structures were determined through MS/MS. MS/MS experiments were performed after isolating the monoisotopic parent ion using 500 ms of sustained 1-kHz off-resonance irradiation collision-induced dissociation and a 90-ms nitrogen gas pulse. The resulting scans were internally calibrated using the exact mass of the parent ion. Chiral Analysis of 5-HODE—5-HODE, prepared by incubation of sebaleic acid with neutrophils as described above, was converted to its methyl ester by treatment with diazomethane and purified by RP-HPLC. The neutrophil-derived 5-HODE was then analyzed by HPLC using a Chiralpak AD column (10-μm particle size, 4.6 × 250 mm; Chiral Technologies, Exton, PA). A mobile phase of 3% methanol in hexane was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. As previously reported (23Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the performance of this column was vastly improved by using methanol instead of isopropyl alcohol as the polar modifying component of the mobile phase. Measurement of Cytosolic Calcium Levels—Calcium levels were measured in neutrophils that were loaded with indo-1 by incubation with its acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min in PBS– (24Powell W.S. MacLeod R.J. Gravel S. Gravelle F. Bhakar A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed and resuspended in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. Following stabilization of the base line, fluorescence was measured using a Photon Technology International Deltascan 4000 spectrofluorometer with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Measurement of Actin Polymerization—Actin polymerization was measured in a mixed leukocyte fraction obtained as described above for neutrophils, except that centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque was omitted. Aliquots of the leukocyte suspension (90 μl, 5 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of either vehicle (10 μl of PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) or sebaleic acid metabolites. After 20 s, the incubations were terminated by the addition of formaldehyde, cytosolic F-actin was stained by incubation with NBD-phallacidin, and F-actin levels were measured by flow cytometry as previously described (25Monneret G. Li H. Vasilescu J. Rokach J. Powell W.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Measurement of Chemotactic Activity—Neutrophil migration was measured by the modified Boyden technique using 48-well microchemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) and Sartorius cellulose nitrate filters (8-μm pore size; 140-μm thickness; Neuro Probe Inc.) (24Powell W.S. MacLeod R.J. Gravel S. Gravelle F. Bhakar A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar). Potential agonists were added to the bottom wells, whereas neutrophils (150,000 cells) were added to each of the top wells. After incubation for 2 h, the filters were stained, and the numbers of cells on the bottom surfaces were counted in five different fields at a magnification of ×400 for each incubation, each of which was performed in triplicate. Metabolism of Sebaleic Acid by Neutrophils—To determine whether it can be metabolized by neutrophils, sebaleic acid (50 μm) was incubated with these cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) for 40 min in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 μm) and PMA (50 nm). The products were analyzed by RP-HPLC as shown in Fig. 2A. Two major products were observed, one with a retention time (tR) of 32.9 min (metabolite I), which absorbed in the UV at 235 nm, and the other (metabolite II) with a tR of 34.3 min and UV absorbance at 280 nm. There were also smaller peaks with tR values at 13.2 min (235 nm; metabolite III) and 15.1 min (280 nm; metabolite IV). None of these peaks was present when sebaleic acid was omitted (data not shown). In addition, there were peaks corresponding to metabolites of endogenous arachidonic acid, which were also present when neutrophils were incubated with A23187 and PMA in the absence of sebaleic acid. These included 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (tR, 5.2 min), the two 6-trans isomers of LTB4 (tR, 17.0 and 17.6 min), LTB4 (tR, 18.5 min), 5-HETE (tR, 31.4 min), and 5-oxo-ETE (tR, 31.7 min). The UV spectra of metabolites I–IV are shown in Fig. 2B. Metabolites I and III have virtually identical UV spectra, with λmax values at 233 nm, similar to that of 5-HETE, consistent with conjugated dienyl alcohols (i.e. monohydroxy octadecadienoic acids). Metabolites II and IV also have similar UV spectra with λmax values at 280 and 282 nm, respectively, similar to that of 5-oxo-ETE and consistent with conjugated dienones (i.e. oxo-octadecadienoic acids). Identification of Sebaleic Acid Metabolites I and II—Because of the presence of 5-LO and 5-HEDH in neutrophils, we suspected that sebaleic acid was converted to 5-hydroxy and 5-oxo metabolites. To aid in the identification of these products, 5-HODE and 5-oxo-ODE were prepared by total chemical synthesis as shown in Fig. 1 and found to have chromatographic properties and UV spectra identical with those of metabolites I and II, respectively. To obtain more conclusive evidence for the identities of these metabolites, they were prepared by incubation of sebaleic acid with neutrophils and purified by RP-HPLC. Analysis by high resolution electrospray ionization-FTMS in MS mode revealed that metabolites I and II had intense ions at m/z 295.2283 ( (C18H31O3−1) requires 295.2279) and 293.2122 ( (C18H29O3−1) requires 293.2122), respectively, consistent with the carboxylate anions of hydroxy and oxo derivatives of octadecadienoic acid. CID of the M-1 ion at m/z 295 for metabolite I resulted in a product ion spectrum (Fig. 3A) with major ions at m/z 277.2173 ( (C18H29O2−1) requires 277.2173; M-1-H2O), 259.2066 ( (C18H27O−1) requires 259.2067; M-1–2×H2O), 251.2381 ( (C17H31O−1) requires 251.2380; M-1-CO2), 235.2068 ( (C16H27O−1) requires 235.2067; C3-C18-2), 233.2275 ( (C17H29−1) requires 233.2275; M-1-CO2-H2O), 223.2067 ( (C15H27O−1) requires 223.2067; C4-C18), 179.1806 (C13H23– requires 179.1805; C6-C18, formed by cleavage adjacent to the 5-hydroxyl group), 115.0401 ( (C5H7O3−1) requires 115.0401; C1-C5-1, also formed by cleavage adjacent to the 5-hydroxyl group), and 111.0453 ( (C6H7O2−1) requires 111.0451; C1-C6-H2O). This mass spectrum is virtually identical to that of authentic chemically synthesized 5-HODE (Fig. 3C). The identical mass spectral, UV, and chromatographic properties of the biologically and chemically derived compounds clearly indicate that metabolite I is 5-HODE. CID of the M-1 ion at m/z 293 for metabolite II gave a product ion spectrum (Fig. 3B) with major ions at m/z 275.2016 ( (C18H27O2−1) requires 275.2017; M-1-H2O), 257.1910 ( (C18H25O−1) requires 257.1911; M-1–2×H2O), 249.2224 ( (C17H29O−1) requires 249.2224; M-1-CO2), 233.1911 ( (C16H25O−1) requires 233.1911; C3-C18-2), 231.2119 ( (C17H27−1) requires 231.2118; M-1-CO2-H2O), 221.1911 ( (C15H25O−1) requires 221.1911; C4-C18), 179.1806 ( (C13H23−1) requires 179.1805; C6-C18, formed by cleavage adjacent to the 5-oxo group), 129.0557 ( (C6H9O3−1) requires 129.0557; C1-C6+2), 113.0245 ( (C5H5O3−1) requires 113.0244; C1-C5-1, formed by cleavage adjacent to the 5-oxo group), and 111.0451 ( (C6H7O2−1) requires 111.0452). Except for some differences in the relative intensities of some of the ions, probably because the spectra were run on different days, this mass spectrum is virtually identical to that of authentic chemically synthesized 5-oxo-ODE (Fig. 3D). The identity of the chromatographic properties, UV spectrum, and mass spectrum of metabolite II with those of authentic 5-oxo-ODE indicates that metabolite II is identical to this compound. 5-LO Is Responsible for the Formation of 5-HODE and 5-Oxo-ODE from Sebaleic Acid—To ensure that 5-HODE was synthesized enzymatically rather than by autoxidation of sebaleic acid, we investigated the chirality of the 5-hydroxyl group of 5-HODE using a Chiralpak AD column. All compounds were analyzed as their methyl ester (ME) derivatives. Chemically synthesized 5R-HODE-ME and 5S-HODE-ME were completely separated from one another, with tR values of 6.9 and 10.8 min, respectively (Fig. 4A). The identity of the first peak as the 5R isomer was confirmed by chromatographing synthetic 5R-HETE-ME (tR, 6.9 min) separately (Fig. 4B). 5S-HODE-ME, chromatographed separately, had a tR of 10.8 min (data not shown). Neutrophil-derived 5-HODE-ME had a tR of 10.8 min, identical to that of the chemically synthesized compound (Fig. 4C). The involvement of 5-LO in the formation of sebaleic acid oxidation products by neutrophils was examined by using a FLAP antagonist (MK-886) and a 5-LO inhibitor (zileuton). MK-886 strongly inhibited the formation of both 5-HODE and 5-oxo-ODE from sebaleic acid with an IC50 of about 30 nm in both cases (Fig. 4D). Zileuton also had identical inhibitory effects on the formation of the two sebaleic acid metabolites but was less potent (IC50 ∼10 μm) (Fig. 4E). Identification of Metabolites III and IV—To determine whether the two polar metabolites III and IV were formed by further metabolism of 5-HODE, chemically synthesized 5-HODE was incubated with neutrophils in the presence of PMA, and the products were analyzed by RP-HPLC. 5-HODE was converted to 5-oxo-ODE (metabolite II) along with metabolites III and IV (Fig. 5A). Incubation of 5-oxo-ODE with neutrophils (in the absence of PMA) gave rise almost exclusively to metabolite IV (data not shown). Analysis of metabolites III and IV by FTMS in MS mode revealed intense ions at m/z 311.2232 ( (C18H31O4−1) requires 311.2228) and 309.2071 ( (C18H29O4−1) requires 309.2071), respectively, consistent with hydroxy metabolites of 5-HODE and 5-oxo-ODE. Further analysis of metabolite III by CID of the M-1 ion at m/z 311 led to the formation of product ions (Fig. 3E) at m/z 293.2126 ( (C18H29O3−1) req"
https://openalex.org/W1969124533,"The spectrin cytoskeleton assembles within discrete regions of the plasma membrane in a wide range of animal cell types. Although recent studies carried out in vertebrate systems indicate that spectrin assembly occurs indirectly through the adapter protein ankyrin, recent studies in Drosophila have established that spectrin can also assemble through a direct ankyrin-independent mechanism. Here we tested specific regions of the spectrin molecule for a role in polarized assembly and function. First, we tested mutant beta-spectrins lacking ankyrin binding activity and/or the COOH-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for their assembly competence in midgut, salivary gland, and larval brain. Remarkably, three different assembly mechanisms operate in these three cell types: 1) neither site was required for assembly in salivary gland; 2) only the PH domain was required in midgut copper cells; and 3) either one of the two sites was sufficient for spectrin assembly in larval brain. Further characterization of the PH domain revealed that it binds strongly to lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) but not phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. A K8Q mutation in the lipid binding region of the PH domain eliminated the PIP(2) interaction in vitro, yet the mutant protein retained full biological function in vivo. Reporter gene studies revealed that PIP(2) and the spectrin PH domain codistribute with one another in cells but not with authentic wild type alphabeta-spectrin. Thus, it appears that the PH domain imparts membrane targeting activity through a second mechanism that takes precedence over its PIP(2) binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W2022253215,"Although synthesized in the same pituitary gonadotropes, the secretion profiles of lutropin (LH) and follitropin (FSH) differ. LH is secreted through a regulated pathway and associated with a bolus release at mid-estrous cycle. In contrast, the majority of FSH is secreted constitutively with an incremental increase until ovulation. Both share an identicalα subunit, and thus theβ subunit contains determinants for sorting into the regulated pathway. Previously, we demonstrated that a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide of the LHβ subunit (Leu-Ser-Gly-Leu-Leu-Phe-Leu), not found in the FSHβ subunit, influences the intracellular behavior of the LH dimer. To test the hypothesis that the peptide contributes to differential sorting, we monitored the fates of LH and LHΔT (LHβ subunit lacking the carboxyl-terminal seven amino acids) dimers in the rat somatotrope-derived GH3 cell line in which both the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways operate. Pulse-chase labeling demonstrated that the LHΔT dimer was diverted to the constitutive pathway, resulting in a significant decrease in the corresponding intracellular pool. Forskolin stimulated LH dimer release 3-fold, which was accompanied by a parallel decrease of intracellular LH; only marginal forskolin stimulation of LHΔT was seen. Immunofluorescence after cycloheximide treatment demonstrated decreased retention of LHΔT compared with LH, consistent with increased constitutive secretion of LHΔT. We also demonstrated that fusing the heptapeptide to the carboxyl terminus of the FSHβ subunit resulted in an increased regulated secretion of this FSH analog compared with wild-type FSH.

They are heterodimers that share a common α subunit but differ in their hormone-specific β subunits (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev.

The mature carbohydrate structures are hormone-specific in that the terminal oligosaccharide is sulfate for LH (3Green E.D. Boime I. Baenziger J.U. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1986; 72: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LH and FSH play key roles in regulating reproductive function. In females, FSH stimulates follicular growth, maintaining a steady concentration during the early follicular stage, and is required to facilitate selection of follicles to the preovulatory phase. At this time, low levels of LH stimulate steroidogenesis in thecal cells by enhancing androgen synthesis, which in turn is converted to estradiol in the presence of FSH. The gradual increase in estradiol is essential to initiate the LH surge. The reciprocal relationship between FSH and estrogen concentrations during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is an exquisitely sensitive feedback pathway that governs the selection of the preovulatory follicle (6Luderer, U., and Schwartz, N.

B., eds) pp. 1-25, Springer-Verlag, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 7Farnworth P.G. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 145: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The modes of secretion for LH and FSH are linked to their function; LH is released in pulses via a regulated pathway (i.e. LH is stored in secretory granules) and associated with a bolus release at midcycle to rupture the follicle and form the corpus luteum (6Luderer, U., and Schwartz, N.

By contrast, FSH is primarily constitutively secreted, tightly coupled to its synthesis rate with gradual incremental increases until ovulation (9Thomas S.G. Clarke I.J.

A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The N-linked oligosaccharides play a critical role in the extracellular stability of both hormones. Sulfated oligosaccharides lead to a rapid clearance of LH in vivo, regulating its pulsatile release (3Green E.D. Boime I. Baenziger J.U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 72: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Baenziger J.U. Kumar S. Brodbeck R.M. Smith P.L. Beranek M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sialylation results in greater extracellular longevity of FSH as compared with LH. Although the structural motifs that govern the differential sorting of LH and FSH have yet to be identified, critical structural cues exist that might account for these intracellular events. LH and FSH are synthesized in the same cell and share an identical α subunit, and thus the β subunit must represent the key determinant for the specificity of carbohydrate processing and for the intracellular segregation of one or both hormones. Of all the human glycoprotein hormone β subunits, the LHβ subunit is the most hydrophobic, particularly in the region between residues 75 and 121 (12Talmadge K. Vamvakopoulos N.C. Fiddes J.C. Nature. 1984; 307: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 13Matzuk M.M. Spangler M.M. Camel M. Suganuma N. Boime I. J.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 188: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) subunits encode hydrophobic stretches of seven and six amino acids, respectively, at their carboxyl termini, but a similar heptapeptide is not observed at the carboxyl terminus of the FSHβ subunit. This difference points to the carboxyl end of the LHβ subunit as a potential candidate for a sorting determinant. Some important observations that might explain the unique secretion patterns discussed above have been obtained from transfected animal cell lines. Earlier studies from our laboratory and others demonstrated that the unassembled pituitary β subunits do not efficiently exit the ER in the absence of the α subunit (15Corless C.L. Matzuk M.M.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although co-expression with the α subunit rescues the β subunits, differences exist in the extent of assembly of the α/β subunit pairs. For example, in the case of LHβ, the amount of dimer formed in transfected CHO cells is less than 10% (12Talmadge K. Vamvakopoulos N.C. Fiddes J.C. Nature. 1984; 307: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 15Corless C.L. Matzuk M.M. Ramabhadran T.V. Krichevsky A. Boime I. J.

Fauser B.C. Galway A.B. Hsueh A.J. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4769-4775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The terminal LHβ heptapeptide (Leu-Ser-Gly-Leu-Leu-Phe-Leu) accounts, in part, for this inefficient assembly (13Matzuk M.M. Spangler M.M. Camel M. Suganuma N. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Muyan M. Furuhashi M. Sugahara T. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1678-1687PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we proposed that this sequence serves as a signal capable of governing the intracellular sorting and trafficking of LH (13Matzuk M.M. Spangler M.M. Camel M. Suganuma N. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

To investigate sorting of the LH/FSH dimers and free subunits, we have used the GH3 cell line (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Muyan M. Rzymkiewicz D.M. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is derived from pituitary somatotropes and contain storage vesicles responsive to secretagogues (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, we previously demonstrated that transfected GH3 cells secrete LH and FSH primarily through regulated and constitutive secretory pathways, respectively (21Muyan M. Rzymkiewicz D.M. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that the LH N-linked carbohydrates were sulfated (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The above observations were in marked contrast with data obtained from transfected CHO cells in which no detectable responses to secretagogues or LH sulfation were observed (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Muyan M. Rzymkiewicz D.M. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we tested the requirement of the LHβ heptapeptide to direct LH to the regulated pathway of GH3 cells. The data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide contributes to the trafficking of LH dimer to the regulated secretory pathway. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—GH3 cells were a gift from Dr. Dennis Shields (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). The cells were grown (no more than 30 passages) at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 12.5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc., Indianapolis, IN), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) on semiconfluent cells in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of the α, LHβ, LHβ114 (designated LHβΔT), FSHβ, or FSHβ-LHβ chimera (designated FSHβ-L) subunit genes (Fig. 1) contained in the vector pM2HA (19Matzuk M.M. Krieger M. Corless C.L. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to obtain clones expressing the individual subunits and corresponding dimers. Stable clones were selected ∼16 days later with 0.25 mg/ml G418 (Research Product International, Mt. Prospect, IL). Single colonies were isolated and subsequently screened by immunoprecipitating the media and lysates of metabolically labeled cells (see below). Several clones (n = 5 per dimer) expressing the dimers LH, LHΔT, FSH, or FSH-L were maintained in culture in the presence of 0.125 mg/ml G418 and used for the experiments described below. The mutant LHβΔT described previously lacks a seven-amino acid extension (Leu-Ser-Gly-Leu-Leu-Phe-Leu) at the carboxyl terminus of the LHβ subunit (13Matzuk M.M. Spangler M.M. Camel M. Suganuma N. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To construct FSHβ-L, the heptapeptide sequence of LHβ subunit (plus the stop codon) was inserted in-frame at the 3′-end of the FSHβ subunit by using overlapping PCR mutagenesis. The PCR was performed using KlenTag DNA polymerase (Sigma) and GenAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primers were used in the construction of the FSHβ-L chimera: oligo 1 (universal primer for pM2HA); 5′-TTC TCC CCC GCA GCC CTA GAA GAC GTT CCA-3′; oligo 2; 5′-GAG GAG GCC TGA GAG TTC TTT CAT TTC ACC-3′; oligo 3; 5′-GGT GAA ATG AAA GAA CTC TCA GGC CTC CTC-3′; oligo 4 (universal primer for pM2HA); 5′-TTT TCA CTG CAT TCT AGT TGT GGT TTG TCC-3′. The universal primers (oligos 1 and 4) corresponded to the sequences in pM2HA vector located upstream and downstream of multiple cloning sites. In the first PCR reaction, the FSHβ-CTP-α gene was used as a template with primers 1 and 2 to amplify product A containing the entire FSHβ sequence and the beginning of the heptapeptide of LHβ subunit. A parallel reaction containing primers 3 and 4 and the LHβ subunit as a template generated PCR product B comprising part of FSHβ exon 3 and the heptapeptide sequence of LHβ with its stop codon. The overlapping PCR was performed using fragments A and B with primers 1 and 4, resulting in the final product FSHβ-L (FSHβ with the seven amino acids of LHβ subunit), which was sequenced to ensure no errors occurred during the PCR reactions. The FSHβ-L chimera was enzymatically digested by BamHI and inserted into the pM2HA vector. The pM2HA vector is a pSV2 neo derivative, which contains the ampicillin resistance and neomycin resistance genes and the Harvey murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For continuous labeling experiments, cells were plated into 6- or 12-well dishes and grown for ∼4 days to near confluency. Cells were labeled for 16 h with 20 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (specific activity > 1000 Ci/mmol, MP Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) in Ham's F-12 medium minus cysteine and G418 but supplemented with 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Labeling with inorganic sulfate was performed for 16 h in Ham's F-12 sulfate-free medium with 0.7 mCi/ml carrier-free sulfate (Na2[35S]O4; MP Biomedicals Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, confluent cells grown on 6-well plates were preincubated for 1.5 h with cysteine-free medium followed by a 20 min pulse in this medium containing 80 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine. At the end of the pulse, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with prewarmed chase medium comprising Ham's F-12, 1 mm unlabeled l-cysteine (Sigma), 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics and incubated in this medium for up to 24 h. All collected media and cell lysates were treated with iodoacetamide and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to inhibit proteases. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, samples (2 ml) were precleared with 7.5 μl/ml normal rabbit serum and Pansorbin (EMD Biosciences Inc., La Jolla, CA). The supernates were divided into two aliquots and immunoprecipitated for 2 h at room temperature by anti-α or anti-CGβ (which cross-reacts with the LHβ subunit) rabbit polyclonal sera. The immune complexes were precipitated with Pansorbin and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5 or 15% gels. For quantitative comparisons of LH and LHΔT, equal volumes of samples were always loaded on the gel. The gels were soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate for 15 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (18Muyan M. Furuhashi M. Sugahara T. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1678-1687PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin-stimulated Secretion—To examine gonadotropin storage and regulated secretion of dimers, five wells of LH and LHΔT cells were labeled for 16 h with [35S]sulfate or [35S]cysteine. Medium and lysate from one well were collected and served as the 0 time controls for the subsequent experiments. Cells in the remaining four wells were preincubated in chase medium (containing 1 mm unlabeled l-cysteine, 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics) for 2 h to reduce the background of the constitutive pool. After the 2-h preincubation, media were collected and frozen for immunoprecipitation. During a second 2-h period, two wells received fresh chase medium with forskolin (25 μm final concentration; Sigma) (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the remaining two wells were incubated without secretagogue. Cells expressing LHΔT were also incubated in the presence or absence of forskolin immediately after a 16-h labeling without the 2-h preincubation period. All labeled culture media and cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with α antiserum and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. To examine the storage and secretion of FSH and FSH-L dimers, cells were labeled for 4 h with [35S]cysteine instead of sulfate, because the N-linked oligosaccharides of FSH are not sulfated as they are in LH. Medium and lysate from one well were collected and served as the 0 time controls for the subsequent experiment. Cells in one well received chase medium for 2 h with forskolin (25 μm final concentration) (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the remaining well was incubated without secretagogue. All labeled culture media and cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with FSH dimer-specific antibody (FSH 54B) and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence—GH3 cells expressing LH or LHΔT were grown on Fisherbrand Superfrost-Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) in Petri dishes as described above. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX) (15 μg/ml; Sigma). Immediately following CHX treatment, all cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Tween for 10 min. Cells were then incubated in 20% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h to block nonspecific binding and washed three times for 10 min in 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After washing, cells were incubated in rabbit anti-CGβ antiserum (1:250; also used for immunoprecipitation experiments) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times in 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated in goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:250; Invitrogen) for 20 min. Cells were then washed three times in 2% bovine serum albumin and once in phosphate-buffered saline and counterstained with TOPRO-iodide (Invitrogen) for 15 min. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min; coverslips were added using VectaShield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and cells were examined by confocal microscopy using an Olympus FV-500 microscope with a ×60 water objective. The experiment was repeated three times. Cells from at least two fields from each slide were counted by two individuals (one blind to treatment) and were scored as either negative or positive; ∼200 cells per slide were counted. Cells were considered positive if multiple discrete puncta were observed. Negative cells were devoid of puncta, similar to cells incubated with normal rabbit serum. Analysis of Data—The labeled bands from autoradiography were scanned using a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer, and the intensity of bands was quantitated by densitometric analysis using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Equal exposure times for the autoradiograms were used when comparing the results of synthesis and protein secretion for LH, LHΔT, FSH, and FSH-L dimers. The secretion t½ for the dimers corresponds to the time when 50% of the labeled dimer, as determined from the presence of α subunit, accumulated in the medium when immunoprecipitating with CGβ antisera. Recovery of subunit (%) was determined as the amount of labeled subunit in medium as a fraction of the total. The sorting index of LH, LHΔT, FSH, and FSH-L dimer corresponds to the ratio of the band intensity on autoradiograms obtained with forskolin (+F) to the band intensity obtained without (-F) forskolin. For immunofluorescence, results are expressed as the percentage of positive cells. Each experiment was repeated three to eight times, analyzed using a paired t test, and the results are expressed as mean ± S.E., with p < 0.05 considered significantly different. Secretion of LH and LHΔT After Steady-state Labeling—Previously we showed in CHO cells that deleting the seven-amino acid hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal extension from the LHβ subunit enhances secretion and alters processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides of this truncated subunit (designated LHβΔT, Fig. 1) compared with the wild-type LHβ subunit (19Matzuk M.M. Krieger M. Corless C.L. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspected that, because this sequence affects the intracellular disposition of the subunit, it contributes to LH sorting in the regulated pathway. Because CHO cells lack a regulated secretory pathway, we examined the secretion of LH and the mutant LHΔT in GH3 cells, which contain both constitutive and regulated routes (20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Muyan M. Rzymkiewicz D.M. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the secretion of two sets of representative clones (Groups 1 and 2) expressing either LH or LHΔT heterodimers after 16 h of labeling with [35S]cysteine. Immunoprecipitation of LH dimer secreting cells with α antiserum co-precipitates the β subunit, reflecting the extent of heterodimer formation (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 2), and the combined and free (asterisks) forms of α subunit. The unassembled α subunit is unique in that it undergoes a post-translational modification resulting in a more heterogeneous form, which clearly distinguishes it from the dimer species (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 2). The free α subunit is rapidly secreted with no detectable intracellular accumulation (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 1). As reported previously (18Muyan M. Furuhashi M. Sugahara T. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1678-1687PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bielinska M. Rzymkiewicz D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), after overnight labeling the secreted heterodimer precipitated with α antiserum contains labeled α subunit associated with only a fraction of the total labeled β subunit seen in the lysate (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 3). This is presumably due to the presence of a stable, nonlabeled intracellular pool of assembly-competent LHβ subunit (see “Discussion”). Precipitation of LH dimer by β subunit antiserum co-precipitates α subunit from the lysate and medium (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3 and 4). Note that the α subunit is only weakly observed in the lysate (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3), reflecting the extent of heterodimer accumulating after steady state labeling. Note also the absence of the heterogeneous free α subunit in the media (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast to the free α subunit, a significant fraction of the unassembled β subunit accumulates intracellularly (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3), despite the presence of excess α subunit, and is confined to the ER (12Talmadge K. Vamvakopoulos N.C. Fiddes J.C. Nature. 1984; 307: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 14Hayashizaki Y. Miyai K. Kato K. Matsubara K. FEBS Lett. 1985; 188: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This result agrees with earlier studies showing that in transfected cell lines the LHβ subunit inefficiently heterodimerizes with the α subunit (18Muyan M. Furuhashi M. Sugahara T. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1678-1687PubMed Google Scholar, 19Matzuk M.M. Krieger M. Corless C.L. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the unassembled β subunit is not secreted efficiently. As expected from our previous work in CHO cells (18Muyan M. Furuhashi M. Sugahara T. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1678-1687PubMed Google Scholar), the extent of heterodimer formation is significantly increased when the heptapeptide is deleted (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 5-8). This is reflected in the 3.1 ± 0.4-fold reduction (p < 0.05) in the lysate fraction of the unassembled LHβΔT subunit immunoprecipitated with β antiserum compared with the LHβ subunit (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3 and 7). In addition, immunoprecipitation with α antiserum demonstrated a 2.6 ± 0.1-fold decrease (p < 0.05) in the amount of intracellular LHΔT (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 5) and 2.3 ± 0.2-fold increase (p < 0.05) in the secretion of LHΔT compared with LH dimer (lanes 2 and 6). This is associated with an increase in the incorporation of the labeled LHβΔT subunit in heterodimer compared with the wild-type LHβ subunit. It is curious that the truncated LHβΔT subunit migrates slower in the gel compared with the wild-type LHβ subunit. It is unclear whether this is due to the unmasking of a site for post-translational change or an effect on the mobility of the subunit on the gel. These data show that the total LHΔT secreted from GH3 cells is greater than LH dimer. Pulse-Chase Kinetics—The steady-state labeling suggested that less of the LHΔT dimer is retained in"
https://openalex.org/W2044012809,"Polycomb (PcG) and trithorax (trxG) genes encode proteins involved in the maintenance of gene expression patterns, notably Hox genes, throughout development. PcG proteins are required for long-term gene repression whereas TrxG proteins are positive regulators that counteract PcG action. PcG and TrxG proteins form large complexes that bind chromatin at overlapping sites called Polycomb and Trithorax Response Elements (PRE/TRE). A third class of proteins, so-called ""Enhancers of Trithorax and Polycomb"" (ETP), interacts with either complexes, behaving sometimes as repressors and sometimes as activators. The role of ETP proteins is largely unknown.In a two-hybrid screen, we identified Cyclin G (CycG) as a partner of the Drosophila ETP Corto. Inactivation of CycG by RNA interference highlights its essential role during development. We show here that Corto and CycG directly interact and bind to each other in embryos and S2 cells. Moreover, CycG is targeted to polytene chromosomes where it co-localizes at multiple sites with Corto and with the PcG factor Polyhomeotic (PH). We observed that corto is involved in maintaining Abd-B repression outside its normal expression domain in embryos. This could be achieved by association between Corto and CycG since both proteins bind the regulatory element iab-7 PRE and the promoter of the Abd-B gene.Our results suggest that CycG could regulate the activity of Corto at chromatin and thus be involved in changing Corto from an Enhancer of TrxG into an Enhancer of PcG."

We report that BCR-ABL transformation of hematopoietic cells results in suppression of IFN-dependent responses, including transcription of IFN-inducible genes and generation of IFN-mediated antiviral effects. BCR-ABL transformation suppresses expression of several IFN-regulated genes containing IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE) or GAS elements in their promoters, including Isg15, Irf1, Irf9, and Ifit2 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2). Suppression of transcription of ISRE-containing genes is also seen in cells expressing various BCR-ABL kinase domain mutants, including T315I, H396P, Y253F, and E255K, but not kinase-defective BCR-ABL. Such effects are associated with impaired IFN-dependent phosphorylation of Stat1 on Tyr701 and Stat3 on Tyr705 and defective binding of Stat complexes to ISRE or GAS elements. Beyond suppression of Stat activities, BCR-ABL inhibits IFN-inducible phosphorylation/activation of the p38 MAPK, suggesting a dual mechanism by which this abnormal fusion protein blocks IFN transcriptional responses. The inhibitory activities of BCR-ABL ultimately result in impaired IFNα-mediated protection against encephalomyocarditis virus infection and reversal of IFN-dependent growth suppression.

The transcriptional activation of such genes is primarily regulated by the engagement of Jak-Stat signaling cascades, pathways that are rapidly activated after binding of IFNs to their respective cell surface receptor. Type I IFNs (α, β, ω, κ, and ϵ) utilize the type I IFN receptor, whereas IFNγ binds to a distinct receptor, the type II IFN receptor (reviewed in Refs. 13Pestka S. Krause C.D. Walter M.R. Immunol.

Previous studies have shown that in BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region Abelson leukemia fusion protein)-expressing cells, there is deregulation of certain pathways used by IFNs to induce antileukemic effects (20Katsoulidis E.

Lymphoma. 2002; 43: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For instance, in one study, the leukemic cells of a subset of CML patients that did not respond to IFNα were found to lack Stat1 expression (31Landolfo S. Guarini A. Riera L. Gariglio M. Gribaudo G. Cignetti A. Cordone I. Montefusco E. Mandelli F. Foa R. Hematol. J. 2000; 1: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas approximately half of the IFNα-resistant patients in another study had increased levels of SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) (32Sakai I.

Thus, although lack of Stat1 expression or overexpression of SOCS3 is associated with IFN resistance in CML, additional mechanisms apparently contribute to IFN resistance in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Interestingly, other studies have shown that BCR-ABL modestly activates Stat1 and Stat3 through tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3 and strongly phosphorylates and activates Stat5 and the adapter protein CrkL, resulting in the formation of CrkL-Stat5 complexes that bind to GAS elements to regulate transcription of BCR-ABL-regulated genes (33Ilaria Jr., R.L.

It is intriguing that IFNα also triggers activation of CrkL and formation of IFN-dependent CrkL-Stat5 complexes that regulate transcription of a subset of IFN-sensitive genes (36Fish E.N. Uddin S.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2047-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Such findings have raised the possibility that the type I IFN receptor and BCR-ABL compete for the utilization of certain common signaling elements and pathways that are required for the transmission of signals essential for generation of their biological effects. In the current study, we determined whether the abnormal BCR-ABL protein can activate signals that antagonize the transcriptional activation of IFN-regulated genes. Overexpression of BCR-ABL in IFN-sensitive cells suppressed IFNα-dependent transcriptional activity via ISRE elements in luciferase reporter assays and dramatically decreased the expression of several IFN-inducible genes known to mediate antiviral responses, such as Irf1, Irf9, Isg15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15), and Ifit2. The down-regulation of such genes was also observed in cells expressing various imatinib mesylate resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain mutants, and was associated with decreased levels of IFNα-induced Stat1-Stat1, Stat1-Stat3, and Stat3-Stat3 binding to SIE elements or decreased binding of the ISGF3 complex to ISRE elements in the promoters of IFN-regulated genes. In addition, BCR-ABL suppressed the IFN-dependent phosphorylation/activation of p38 MAPK, whose function is essential for optimal transcription of IFN-regulated genes. Importantly, the generation of IFNα-dependent antiviral and growth-inhibitory responses was suppressed in BCR-ABL-expressing Ba/F3 cells, indicating that the effects of BCR-ABL on IFN transcriptional activity translated to important antagonistic biological responses.

Equal numbers of cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with interferon α or STI versus Me2SO as indicated for 5–7 days. BA/F3 pSRα, BA/F3 MIGR1, and BA/F3 MIG BCR-ABL KI cells were grown in the presence of interleukin-3. Mobility Shift Assays—Actively growing U2OS cells, transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 BCR-ABL, or BA/F3 pSRα and pSRα BCR-ABL cells were pretreated with Me2SO or STI-571 (1 μm) for 1 h and then treated with IFNβ or IFNα or left untreated, as indicated. 10 μg of nuclear extracts were analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, as described previously (36Fish E.N.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide (ATTTCCCGTAAATCCC), which represents a sis-inducing element (SIE) from the c-fos promoter was synthesized and used to detect Stat1-Stat1, Stat1-Stat3, and Stat3-Stat3 binding in the gel shift assays. ISGF3 complexes were detected using a double-stranded oligonucleotide (CTGTTGGTTTCGTTTCCTCAGA), representing an ISRE element from the Isg15 gene. Luciferase Reporter Assays—U2OS cells were transfected with an ISRE luciferase construct and a constitutive β-galactosidase expression vector using the superfect transfection reagent according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The same method was used to transfect U2OS cells with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 BCR-ABL. The ISRE-luciferase construct included the wild-type ISG15 ISRE (TCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC) cloned via cohesive ends into the BamHI site of the pZtkLuc vector and was provided by Dr. Richard Pine (Public Health Research Institute, New York, NY) (44Uddin S.

Forty-two hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were pretreated with Me2SO or STI-571 (1 or 5 μm) for 1 h and then left untreated or treated with 5 × 103 units/ml of human IFNβ for 6 h, as indicated. In addition, in order to suppress all BCR-ABL effects, Me2SO or STI-571 was added to U2OS cells directly post-transfection, and cells were treated with 5 × 103 units/ml of human IFNβ for 6 h or were left untreated before the luciferase assays were performed. ChIP Assays—ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP kit from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BA/F3 cells were treated with IFNα for 180 min or were left untreated, as indicated. Cells were fixed, and DNA fragments were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-Stat1 antibody or control nonimmune RIgG. Precipitated and input control nonprecipitated DNA fragments were used as templates for real time PCR with the mouse ISRE-ISG15 gene (Mm01705338_s1) probes and primers from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Values were calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding detected in control RIgG immunoprecipitates from specific ISG15-DNA binding detected in anti-Stat1 immunoprecipitates. mRNA Isolation and Conversion, Real Time PCR Probes, and Primers—Isolation, purification of mRNA, and conversion into cDNA was performed using the respective kits and oligo(dT)s from Qiagen Inc. (Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probes and primers for real time PCR were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The primers and probes used were Isg15 (Mm01705338_s1), Irf9 (Mm0049 2679_m1), Irf1 (Mm00515191_m1), Ifit2 (Mm00492606_m1), and SOCS3 (Mm00545913_s1). Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1) was used as an internal control. Antiviral Assays—The antiviral effects of mouse IFNα in BA/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (wild type) or vector pSRα were determined as previously described (29Kaur S. Lal L. Sassano A. Majchrzak-Kita B. Srikanth M. Baker D.P. Petroulakis E. Hay N. Soneberg N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1757-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) was used as the challenge virus. In initial experiments, we examined whether BCR-ABL expression exerts regulatory effects on type I IFN-dependent, ISRE-driven, gene transcription. For this purpose, a system in which BCR-ABL was transiently overexpressed in U2OS cells (Fig. 1A) was initially used. Cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 (empty vector) or a pcDNA3-BCR-ABL construct (Fig. 1A), together with a luciferase reporter plasmid, under the control of an ISRE. As expected, IFNβ treatment led to a robust induction of ISRE-dependent transcription in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, ISRE-driven transcription was significantly suppressed in cells transfected with BCR-ABL (Fig. 1B). Such BCR-ABL-mediated suppression of ISRE-driven transcription was only partially reversed when cells were pretreated with imatinib mesylate (STI-571), added to the cultures 60 min prior to IFN treatment (Fig. 1A). However, if imatinib mesylate was added to the cultures immediately following transfection of cells with the pcDNA3-BCR-ABL construct, there was complete reversal of the suppressive effects of BCR-ABL (Fig. 1C), suggesting that inhibition of the kinase activity of BCR-ABL early in the process is required for reversal of its effects on IFN signals. Thus, BCR-ABL suppresses type I IFN-dependent transcription, and such suppression appears to require the kinase activity of BCR-ABL. Since ISRE and also SIE sequences are commonly found in the promoters of various type I IFN-inducible genes, including genes that mediate antiviral and/or antiproliferative responses (8Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar, 9Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we sought to directly examine the effects of BCR-ABL overexpression on the transcription of several genes that are known to play roles in the generation of the biological effects of IFNα and other type I IFNs. For such studies, we used Ba/F3 mouse cells stably expressing BCR-ABL (39Griswold I.J. MacPartlin M. Bumm T. Goss V.L. O'Hare T. Lee K.A. Corbin A.S. Stoffregen E.P. Smith C. Johnson K. Moseson E.M. Wood L.J. Polakiewicz R.D. Druker B.J. Deininger M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6082-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In initial studies, we determined the effects of BCR-ABL on the transcriptional regulation of two gene members of the IRF family, Irf9 (also called ISGF3G or p48) and Irf1 (45Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 46Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells transfected with the empty vector or cells expressing BCR-ABL were treated with mouse IFNα, and expression of Irf1 and Irf9 was analyzed using quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR. IFNα treatment resulted in a strong induction of Irf9 (Fig. 2A) and Irf1 (Fig. 2B) gene transcription in Ba/F3 cells transfected with pSRα vector alone. On the other hand, the IFN-dependent up-regulation of these genes was severely suppressed in Ba/F3-BCR-ABL-transfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B), and such suppression was statistically significant (paired values were p = 0.008 for Irf9 and p = 0.007 for Irf1) (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, expression of BCR-ABL did not alter basal expression of Irf9 and Irf1 (Fig. 2, A and B), and only the IFN-inducible expression of these genes was affected. Two additional genes analyzed were Isg15 (Fig. 2C) and the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats Ifit-2 (Fig. 2D). As in the case of Irf1 and Irf9, Isg15 and Ifit-2 have been previously linked to the antiviral properties of IFNs (47Smith J.B. Herschman H.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (60)"
https://openalex.org/W2068561339,"Newly-evolved multiplex sequencing technology has been bringing transcriptome sequencing into an unprecedented depth. Millions of transcript tags now can be acquired in a single experiment through parallelization. The significant increase in throughput and reduction in cost required us to address some fundamental questions, such as how many transcript tags do we have to sequence for a given transcriptome? How could we estimate the total number of unique transcripts for different cell types (transcriptome diversity) and the distribution of their copy numbers (transcriptome dynamics)? What is the probability that a transcript with a given expression level to be detected at a certain sampling depth?We developed a statistical model to evaluate these parameters based on transcriptome-sampling data. Three mixture models were exploited for their potentials to model the sampling frequencies. We demonstrated that relative abundances of all transcripts in a transcriptome follow the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. The widely known beta and gamma distributions failed to fulfill the singular characteristics of relative abundance distribution, i.e., highly skewed toward zero and with a long tail. An estimator of transcriptome diversity and an analytical form of sampling growth curve were proposed in a coherent framework. Experimental data fitted this model very well and Monte Carlo simulations based on this model replicated sampling experiments in a remarkable precision.Taking human embryonic stem cell as a prototype, we demonstrated that sequencing tens of thousands of transcript tags in an ordinary EST/SAGE experiment was far from sufficient. In order to fully characterize a human transcriptome, millions of transcript tags had to be sequenced. This model lays a statistical basis for transcriptome-sampling experiments and in essence can be used in all sampling-based data."
https://openalex.org/W1987027432,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to produce fever by acting on EP3 receptors within the preoptic area of the brain. However, there is little information about the molecular events downstream of EP3 activation in preoptic neurons. As a first step toward this issue, we examined PGE2-induced gene expression changes at single-cell resolution in preoptic neurons expressing EP3. Brain sections of the preoptic area from PGE2- or saline-injected rats were stained with an anti-EP3 antibody, and the cell bodies of EP3-positive neurons were dissected and subjected to RNA amplification procedures. Microarray analysis of the amplified products demonstrated the possibility that gene expression of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subunits is decreased upon PGE2 injection. Indeed, we found that most EP3-positive neurons in the mouse preoptic area are positive for the α2 or γ2 GABAA receptor subunit. Moreover, PGE2 decreased the preoptic gene expression of these GABAA subunits via an EP3-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. PGE2 also attenuated the preoptic protein expression of the α2 subunit in wild-type but not in EP3-deficient mice. These results indicate that PGE2-EP3 signaling elicits Gi/o activation in preoptic thermocenter neurons, and we propose the possibility that a rapid decrease in preoptic GABAA expression may be involved in PGE2-induced fever.

Body temperature is controlled by central and peripheral mechanisms such as heart rate, muscle tone, metabolic rate, vasoconstrictor action, and shivering, thereby reaching a new thermoregulatory set point. Fever is characterized as an elevation in body temperature by 1-2 °C and is one of the representative systemic responses against inflammation (1Saper C.B. Breder C.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1880-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 2Kluger M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Fever is a clinically important symptom associated with many serious diseases such as infections, toxonosis, and neoplasia. Fever responses are initiated by cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, which are released from immune cells activated by exogenous pyrogens such as lipopolysaccharide. These cytokines act on the brain vasculature and therein stimulate prostaglandin (PG) 4The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; POA, preoptic area; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; MnPO, median preoptic nucleus; MPO, medial preoptic nucleus; i.c.v., intracerebroventricular(ly); PT, pertussis toxin; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 4The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; POA, preoptic area; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; MnPO, median preoptic nucleus; MPO, medial preoptic nucleus; i.c.v., intracerebroventricular(ly); PT, pertussis toxin; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. E2 production (3Stitt J.T. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1986; 59: 137-149PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 has been shown to elicit fever, because aspirin-like drugs exert anti-pyretic actions through the suppression of PGE2 biosynthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, a rate-limiting enzyme of PGE2 synthesis (4Milton A.S. Wendlandt S. J. Physiol. 1971; 218: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 5Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PGE2 displays a broad range of actions including fever generation through its binding to specific receptors on target cells. There are four PGE receptor subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, all of which are expressed in the central nervous system (6Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11613-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). We have shown that EP3 plays a pivotal role in inflammation-associated fever, because EP3-deficient mice fail to exhibit fever in response to central administration of PGE2 and interleukin-1β or peripheral administration of interleukin-1β and lipopolysaccharide (7Ushikubi F. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Murata T. Matsuoka T. Kobayashi T. Hizaki H. Tuboi K. Katsuyama M. Ichikawa A. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Narumiya S.

Physiol. 2003; 55: 1945-1954Google Scholar). However, there is still little information about the molecular events downstream of PGE2-EP3 signaling in the central nervous system. The preoptic area (POA), which is the rostral region of the basal forebrain, has been shown to contain a thermocenter because destruction of this region leads to the inability to generate fever and also because the POA is rich in thermosensory neurons and is sensitive to PGE2-induced fever (reviewed in Ref. 9Elmquist J.K. Scammell T.E. Saper C.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 565-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Moreover, the level of PGE2 in the POA is well associated with lipopolysaccharide-induced fever, and indomethacin completely abolishes both lipopolysaccharide-induced fever and the increase in PGE2 levels in the POA (2Kluger M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). We previously showed that a number of EP3-expressing neurons exist in the POA (10Sugimoto Y. Shigemoto R. Namba T.

Neurol. 2000; 421: 543-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and it was recently demonstrated that selective genetic deletion of the EP3 receptors in the POA results in abrogation of the PGE2-induced fever response (12Lazarus M.

These results indicated that PGE2 transmits febrile input by acting on the EP3 receptors expressed in the POA. How then does activation of EP3 receptors in the POA neurons lead to fever generation? It has been demonstrated that EP3-expressing neurons project to the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus, where thermogenic sympathetic premotor neurons are located (13Nakamura K. Matsumura K. Hubschle T. Nakamura Y. Hioki H. Fujiyama F. Boldogkoi Z. Konig M. Thiel H.J. Gerstberger R. Kobayashi S. Kaneko T. J.

Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4600-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, these neurons transneuronally innervate brown adipose tissue, which is the major thermogenic organ in rodents (15Yoshida K. Nakamura K. Matsumura K. Kanosue K. König M. Thiel H.J.

It has been suggested that PGE2 affects the activity of thermosensitive neurons in the POA. For example, it was reported that PGE2 reduces the firing activities of heat-sensitive neurons in the ventromedial preoptic area (16Ranels H.J. Griffin J.D. Brain Res. 2003; 964: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, as a mechanism of fever, PGE2 has been suspected to alter temperature sensitivity in the POA neurons, in most cases via suppressing the firing activities in these neurons. If such effects of PGE2 could be mediated by EP3 receptor, EP3 activation may desensitize temperature sensitivity in these neurons. However, it remains unknown as to what happens to the EP3-expressing neurons in the POA when they receive PGE2 and how EP3 activation leads to fever generation. As a first step to understanding the molecular basis of PGE2-induced fever generation and to characterizing the EP3-expressing neurons in the POA, we undertook to detect gene expression changes in the POA EP3-expressing neurons upon central administration of PGE2. To analyze the changes in gene expression, specifically in EP3-expressing neurons, we employed the technique of microarray analysis at single-cell resolution. Here we show that the POA EP3-expressing neurons co-express GABA type A (GABAA) receptor subunits and that PGE2-EP3 signaling attenuates GABAA expression levels in the POA in a fever-associated manner. Animals—Adult male pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g; Taconic, Germantown, NY) were used for microarray analysis (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The experiments using rats were approved by the Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Adult male pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice (25-30 g; SLC Japan, Hamamatsu, Japan) and EP3 (ptger3)-deficient (EP3-/-) mice with a C57BL/6 genetic background (7Ushikubi F. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Murata T.

The experiments using mice were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Kyoto University. The animals were housed in a light (12 h on/off)- and temperature (22-23 °C)-controlled pathogen-free facility with food and water available ad libitum.TABLE 1A list of genes that showed altered expression levels in EP3-expressing neurons upon PGE2 stimulationGene symbolGene product-Fold change (PGE2 vs. control)Decreased by PGE2ATP7bATPase, Cu2+ -transporting β0.53calcrlCalcitonin receptor-like0.54ank2Ankyrin 2, neuronal0.55cntn3Contactin 30.57stx1b2Syntaxin 1B20.57ncam1Neural cell adhesion molecule 10.57myocMyocilin0.58gabrg2GABAA receptor γ-2 subunit0.59sema6bSemaphorin 6B0.60arts1Type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor-shedding aminopeptidase regulator0.61sypSynaptophysin0.63cdh2Cadherin 20.64tgfbr2Transforming growth factor β receptor II0.64gabra6GABAA receptor α-6 subunit0.66acadvlAcyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, very long chain0.65cd44CD440.66Increased by PGE2rab24Rab241.6folr1Folate receptor 11.5 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2RNA expression of EP3 and GABAA receptor subunits, α2, α6, γ1, and γ2 in mouse POA.

Open table in a new tab Microarray Analysis of POA Neurons Expressing EP3 Receptors—A flowchart of the experimental strategy used to analyze the gene expression changes that occur in EP3-expressing POA neurons upon PGE2 injection is shown in Fig. 1A. A stainless steel cannula was implanted stereotaxically into the lateral cerebral ventricle of a rat and fixed to the skull with acrylic dental cement (8Oka T. Oka K. Kobayashi T. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Saper C.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 55: 1945-1954Google Scholar). PGE2 (500 ng; Sigma) in 5 μl of pyrogen-free 0.9% saline or saline only was injected into the ventricle, and the rectal temperature was monitored. The rats were sacrificed 30 min after the injection and fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were post-fixed, saturated with a sucrose solution, and then cut into coronal sections (10 μm), which were stained with an anti-rat EP3 rabbit antibody as described previously (11Nakamura K. Kaneko T. Yamashita Y. Hasegawa H. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 421: 543-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Single-cell microdissection and RNA amplification were performed essentially as described previously (18Marciano P.G. Brettschneider J. Manduchi E. Davis J.E. Eastman S. Raghupathi R. Saatman K.E. Speed T.P. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Eberwine J.H. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2866-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were incubated with the oligo(dT)-T7 primer and subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase. With the use of a glass micropipette, the cell bodies of individual EP3-positive neurons were carefully microdissected from the surrounding neuropil and subsequently aspirated (19Crino P.B. Trojanowski J.Q. Dichter M.A. Eberwine J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14152-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Photomicrographs were taken before and after aspiration to assure that the cells had positive staining and that only a single cell was detached (Fig. 1B). Twelve single cells derived from three rats per group (PGE2-injected and saline-injected groups) were pooled and subjected to two-round RNA amplification. The labeled probe was synthesized by converting the amplified antisense RNA to either a Cy3- or Cy5-labeled cDNA probe. The resultant probes were hybridized to Incyte Lifearray™ Chips RAT GEM2. The data were normalized, and the genes were ranked based on the magnitude of differential expression calculated across dye swap experiments as described previously (18Marciano P.G. Brettschneider J. Manduchi E. Davis J.E. Eastman S. Raghupathi R. Saatman K.E. Speed T.P. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Eberwine J.H. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2866-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis was repeated independently, and genes showing similar expression changes upon PGE2 injection were selected and presented. In Situ Hybridization and β-Galactosidase Staining—The DNA probes for GABAA (ionotropic) receptor subunits α2 (944 bp), γ1 (1,302 bp), and γ2 (1,168 bp) were amplified from mouse whole brain cDNA and subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). Antisense riboprobes were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [35S]CTP. Hybridization in situ was carried out as described previously (10Sugimoto Y. Shigemoto R. Namba T. Negishi M. Mizuno N. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Serial sections were hybridized with EP3, α2, γ1, and γ2 probes. The specific hybridization of the probe for each GABAA receptor subunit was confirmed by the loss of significant hybridization in experiments in the presence of an excess of unlabeled probe (data not shown). For β-galactosidase staining, brain sections were fixed with glutaraldehyde and then stained with X-gal at 30 °C for 6 h. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Coronal sections (14 μm) of adult male EP3+/- mice were fixed and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing a blocking reagent. The slides were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing an anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:500; Biogenesis) in combination with an anti-GABAA α2 antibody (1:100, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) or an anti-GABAA γ2 antibody (1:30, Alomone Labs). To enhance the signals for GABAA subunits, we employed the Tyramide signal amplification system (Molecular Probes) and antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) or to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes) was also used as a nuclear marker. Images were collected on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope using Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss). Backgrounds were defined as the fluorescence intensity in non-neuronal fields. Dissection of POA and Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)—Wild type and EP3-/- mice anesthetized with α-chrolalose-HBC (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally; Sigma) were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with PGE2 (1 nm, 5 μl) or saline (20Haley T.J. McCormick W.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1957; 12: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar), and rectal temperatures were monitored. Thirty or 60 min after the injection, the mice were sacrificed and brain sections (14 μm) prepared. The POA regions were scraped and subjected to RNA extraction. The POA was defined as follows: the initiation of the third ventricle was determined as the rostral limit, the site where the bilateral anterior commissure joins together as the caudal limit, bottom of the anterior commissure as the dorsal limit, the upper side of the optic chiasm as the ventral limit, and an extension of both lateral ventricles as the side limit. The RNA was reverse-transcribed and subjected to quantitative PCR (LightCycler; Roche Applied Science). Primers used in this study are as follows: GABAA α2, forward (5′-CAGACCTATCTGCCTTG-3′) and reverse (5′-ACTACACTCTTCCCG-3′); GABAA γ1, forward (5′-ACATGGGTCTTGGCAC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGGCGATTAGGCGTTG-3′); GABAA γ2, forward (5′-ATTCCCTGCACACT CA-3′) and reverse (5′-GTGCCATACTCCAC CAA-3′); α-tubulin, forward (5′-AGAGTCGC GCTGTAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GTCTACG AACACTGCCC-3′); neurofilament-M, forward (5′-TGAACTTCGGGGAACCA-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTGTCGGTGTGTGTA-3′); and 28 S ribosomal RNA, forward (5′-CAGTA CGAATACAGACCG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGC AACAACACATCATCAG-3′). The relative mRNA levels of GABAA α2, γ1, g2 and α-tubulin for individual animals were normalized with the mRNA levels of 28 S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 4) or neurofilament-M (Fig. 6) and expressed as -fold change values. Immunoblot Analysis—Wild-type and EP3-/- mice were injected with saline or PGE2 and sacrificed 30 min after the injection. The POA was dissected, homogenized in lysis buffer (66 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, respectively). Protein (10 μg) was loaded into separate lanes in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotting was performed as described previously (21Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After blocking in nonfat milk, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted with nonfat milk (GABAA α2, 1:500), washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After washing, the membranes were stained with an ECL kit (GE Healthcare) and visualized with the LAS system (Fujifilm, Japan). The densities of the bands for GABAA were quantified using Image Gauge software (Fujifilm). As a normalizing control, an anti-actin antibody (Chemicon, 1:2000 dilution) was used. The specificity of the anti-GABAA α2 antibody was confirmed by the loss of the corresponding band when the antigen peptide-preabsorbed antibody was used (data not shown). POA Slice Culture—We performed slice culture based on a method described previously (22Fujimoto S. Katsuki H. Kume T. Akaike A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse brains were removed and cut into coronal slices containing POAs of 500 μm in thickness under sterile conditions. The slices were transferred onto a 30-mm Millicell-CM insert membrane (Millipore) in 6-well plates. The slices were maintained at 37°C in 3 ml/well culture medium consisting of 50% minimum essential medium/HEPES, 25% Hanks' balanced salt solution, and 25% heat-inactivated horse serum supplemented with 6.5 mg/ml d-glucose and 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G potassium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The slices were pretreated with or without pertussis toxin (PT) (200 ng/ml; Seikagaku Japan) for 6 h followed by the addition of PGE2 (1 μm). After incubation with PGE2 for 30 min, the POA was dissected from the slices and subjected to RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR. Data Analysis—Data are shown as means ± S.E. A comparison between two groups was performed using Student's t test; p values <0.05 were considered significantly different. Microarray Analysis of Rat POA EP3-positive Neurons upon PGE2 Injection—As a first step to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying EP3-mediated fever generation, we utilized cDNA microarray analysis at single-cell resolution to detect genes in POA EP3-positive neurons with altered expression levels upon PGE2 injection (Fig. 1A). PGE2- and saline-injected rats were sacrificed 30 min after injection, and POA sections from these rats were fixed, stained with an anti-rat EP3 antibody, and subjected to reverse transcription in situ. The positively stained cell bodies were picked up with glass capillaries (Fig. 1B), and pooled. The cDNAs derived from 12 positive cell bodies/group were extracted and amplified as antisense RNAs, which were subjected to cDNA microarray. Of the ∼8,544 genes represented on the cDNA microarray (Incyte Rat GEM), the genes that showed differential expression values greater than 1.5 or less than -1.5 were selected (18Marciano P.G. Brettschneider J. Manduchi E. Davis J.E. Eastman S. Raghupathi R. Saatman K.E. Speed T.P. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Eberwine J.H. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2866-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Sugimoto Y. Fukada Y. Mori D. Tanaka S. Yamane H. Okuno Y. Deai K. Tsuchiya S. Tsujimoto G. Ichikawa A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2606-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar analysis was repeated independently, and the genes showing similar responses to PGE2 were regarded as differentially expressed genes. After the exclusion of functionally unknown expressed sequence tags, we detected two genes showing more than a 1.5-fold increase and 16 genes showing more than a 1.5-fold decrease upon PGE2 injection (Table 1). Surprisingly, genes down-regulated by PGE2 include vesicle transport-related genes such as syntaxin 1B2 (stx1B2) and synaptophysin (syp), suggesting that PGE2 may alter the vesicle transport status via EP3 receptor. On the other hand, the expression of GABAA receptor genes such as gabrg2 and gabra6 were decreased upon PGE2 stimulation (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Although α6 is the GABAA subunit specifically expressed in the cerebellum, we considered that this result might reflect changes in gene expression of some structurally close GABAA receptor subunits such as α1 or α2, because the cDNA microarray sometimes gives signals for cross-hybridization to structurally close probes. Although GABA is known to be a primary inhibitory transmitter in the central nervous system, it has not been reported that EP3-positive neurons co-express GABAA receptor. In the following studies, we therefore surveyed the GABAA receptor subunits showing expression overlaps with EP3 receptor in the POA. GABAA Subunits α2 and γ2 Are Expressed in EP3-positive Neurons in Mouse POA—Because Wisden et al. (24Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-l062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that mRNAs for the α2 and γ1 subunits of GABAA receptor are abundantly expressed in POA, we examined RNA expression of α2, α6, γ1, and γ2 subunits in the mouse POA section. As reported previously (10Sugimoto Y. Shigemoto R. Namba T. Negishi M. Mizuno N. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the signals for EP3-RNA were detected in the neurons of the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), and rostral wall of the third ventricle. Similarly, the signals for GABAA γ2-RNA were highly concentrated to the regions surrounding the third ventricle in the POA (Fig. 2). The signals for GABAA α2-RNA were distributed more widely than those of EP3 and γ2, but strong signals were observed in the regions surrounding the third ventricle in the POA. The signals for GABAA γ1-RNA were observed only in a few brain areas but were present in the neurons adjacent to the third ventricle in the POA. However, no significant signals for GABAA α6 were found in the POA. The signals for GABAA α2-, γ1-, and γ2-RNA were confined to neurons (data not shown). Thus, distribution of EP3 appears to overlap with those of three GABAA receptor genes, and we selected α2 and γ2 as candidate subunits colocalized with EP3 receptors in the POA. Although an anti-rat EP3 antibody was used to detect EP3-expressing neurons in the POA, this antibody could not detect mouse EP3 receptor protein effectively (25Nakamura K. Kaneko T. Yamashita Y. Hasegawa H. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 260: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, because all anti-mouse EP3 antibodies that we tested were not suitable for immunohistochemistry, we used EP3+/- mice in which the β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene was “knocked in” at the EP3 gene locus (7Ushikubi F. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Murata T. Matsuoka T. Kobayashi T. Hizaki H. Tuboi K. Katsuyama M. Ichikawa A. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 395: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In these animals, EP3-positive cells can be detected by the anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Fig. 4A) (26Kunikata T. Yamane H. Segi E. Matsuoka T. Sugimoto Y. Tanaka S. Tanaka H. Nagai H. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Simultaneous staining of the POA sections of EP3+/- mice for β-galactosidase and GABAA γ2 revealed colocalization of the positive signals in the MnPO and MPO neurons (Fig. 3 and Table 2). In MnPO and MPO, 71.1 and 90.5%, respectively, of EP3-positive neurons were also positive for γ2. Moreover, when we stained the POA sections with anti-β-galactosidase and anti-GABAA α2 antibodies, most of the EP3-positive neurons were also positive for the α2 subunit; in MnPO and MPO, 86.1 and 95.2%, respectively, of the EP3-positive neurons were also positive for α2. These results indicate that most EP3-positive neurons express the GABAA subunits α2 and γ2 in the POA. PGE2 Attenuates Gene Expression of GABAA Receptors in the POA—Because the EP3-positive cell bodies and neuropils are distributed throughout the POA and because most EP3-positive neurons appear to express GABAA subunits, we next tested whether total GABAA transcript levels in the POA could be attenuated by PGE2 stimulation. We therefore examined the effect of central administration of PGE2 on POA gabr gene expression and body temperature in wild-type and EP3-/- mice. When wild-type mice were injected i.c.v. with PGE2, their rectal temperatures were increased by 2 °C at 30 min after the injection, which gradually decreased at 60 min but was still higher than before the injection (Fig. 4A). No such response was observed upon saline injection. Saline injection failed to alter POA gabr expression until 60 min after the injection (Fig. 4B). In contrast, PGE2 significantly attenuated gabrg1 and gabrg2 expression levels at 30 min, and such reduced levels were restored to the original level at 60 min. Furthermore, PGE2 down-regulated gabra2 expression levels at 30 min, and although this was not statistically significant, the PGE2-elicited attenuation in gabra2 expression was still found at 60 min; the effect of PGE2 at this time was significant. In contrast, PGE2 failed to alter the expression of α-tubulin (tuba1a) and other housekeeping genes in the POA (data not shown), indicating that the effect of PGE2 is GABAA gene-specific. Furthermore, the PGE2-elicited reduction in gabr expression was not observed in whole brain (data not shown), indicating that such effect of PGE2 is POA-specific. We then examined whether PGE2-elicited attenuation in GABAA gene expression could be observed in the EP3-/- mice, which do not show fever generation in response to PGE2 injection (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, PGE2 failed to affect the expression of any gabr genes in the POA of EP3-/- mice (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that PGE2-elicited attenuation in POA GABAA gene expression is mediated by EP3 receptor. Thus, PGE2-EP3 signaling appears to down-regulate GABAA gene expression in the POA in a fever-associated manner. PGE2 Attenuates GABAA Receptor Expression at the Protein Level in the POA—Because the gene expression of gabra2 was most closely related to fever generation, we further explored whether PGE2 could attenuate protein levels of GABAA α2 subunit in the POA. Four wild-type and four EP3-/- mice were injected i.c.v. with PGE2 or saline, and POA regions were collected at 30 min after the injection and individually subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5). The 62-kDa band corresponding to the GABAA α2 subunit was observed in the POA protein extract from each animal. Surprisingly, in wild-type mice, the level of the GABAA α2 band was attenuated in all four animals of the PGE2-injected group compared with the saline-injected group. If the reduction in the α2 protein in the POA were due to loss of α2 protein in a particular population of POA neurons expressing EP3, PGE2 injection might alter the ratio of α2-positive neurons per EP3 (β-galactosidase)-positive neuron in the POA. When we compared the ratios in PGE2-injected mice with control mice, we failed to detect any significant changes within the MnPO and MPO; most EP3-positive cells were also positive for α2 even in PGE2-treated mice (data not shown). Thus, PGE2 appears to attenuate GABAA α2 protein levels in each EP3-positive neuron. On the other hand, in EP3-/- mice, PGE2 failed to affect the GABAA α2 protein expression levels in the POA. These results indicate that PGE2 rapidly down-regulates at least GABAA α2 protein levels within the POA via EP3 receptor. PGE2 Attenuates GABAA Gene Expression via a PT-sensitive Pathway—Although EP3 receptor has been shown to be critical in PGE2-induced fever generation, it remains uncertain as to which G protein pathway is activated by PGE2-EP3 signaling in the POA neurons. To address this issue, we established a slice culture model of the mouse brain POA. In this culture system, PGE2 significantly attenuated gabrg1 and gabrg2 gene expression levels within the POA at 30 min after PGE2 addition, and a similar tendency was observed for gabra2 expression (Fig. 6). PT treatment of slices abolished the PGE2-elicited decrease in gabr expression. These results indicate that PGE2 attenuates GABAA gene expression via a PT-sensitive pathway. Although EP3 receptor has been shown to most preferentially couple to Gi1 and Gi2 (27Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Hayashi Y. Namba T. Honda A. Watabe A. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is not certain which G protein pathway is involved in the EP3-mediated physiological actions of PGE2 including fever generation. The current study indicates that EP3 receptor couples to Gi/o proteins in the POA neurons, leading to attenuation of gabr gene expression. If such a molecular event reflects the functional changes of the GABAA channel in thermal regulation as discussed below, fever generation could be triggered by the activation of Gi/o in EP3-expressing POA neurons. One of the most important findings in this study is that most EP3-positive neurons co-express at least the α2 and γ2 subunits of GABAA receptor in the POA. Nakamura et al. (14Nakamura K. Matsumura K. Kaneko T. Kobayashi S. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4600-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously revealed that most EP3-positive neurons in the POA (86%) are also positive for glutamate decarboxylase 67 (gad67) gene expression and that injection of the GABAA agonist muscimol injection into the raphe pallidus nucleus blocks PGE2-induced fever. Based on these results, they proposed the following mechanism of PGE2-induced fever: the EP3-expressing neurons are GABAergic and exert tonic inhibition on raphe pallidus neurons, which couples to stimulation of sympathetic nerves in the steady state (in the absence of PGE2), and when cytokine signals stimulate PG production within the POA, PGE2 somehow inhibits the GABAergic activity of EP3-expressing neurons allowing the excitation of raphe neurons, leading to thermogenesis (14Nakamura K. Matsumura K. Kaneko T. Kobayashi S. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4600-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that the EP3-expressing neurons themselves express GABAA receptors; thus the EP3-expressing neurons are also susceptible to negative regulation by GABA. Indeed, local application of muscimol into the POA has been shown to induce hyperthermia in an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-insensitive manner (28Osborne P.G. Onoe H. Watanabe Y. Brain Res. 1994; 661: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Osaka T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: R306-R313Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This effect of muscimol may reflect the existence of a more universal thermal regulation mechanism by GABA within the POA. If this is true, PGE2-EP3 signaling may stimulate the susceptibility to GABA inhibition by affecting the GABAA channel properties such as sensitivity to GABA or GABA-elicited responses of the POA neurons. GABAA receptors are pentameric and are assembled from 18 subunits (α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ϵ, θ, ρ1-3), and GABAA receptors comprising different subunits show distinct properties in channel pharmacology, cellular localization, and dynamic transport regulation (30Rudolph U. Crestani F. Möhler H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 188-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 31Rudolph U. Möhler H. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that PGE2 rapidly down-regulates protein expression of the GABAA α2 subunit in the POA. Thus, PGE2-EP3 signaling dynamically modulates the subunit components of GABAA channels within the POA, which may be an interesting hypothesis to be explored as a mechanism of fever. Alternatively, however, considering the lag time for transcript-protein conversion (decreases in GABAA protein levels), the GABAA receptor number could be decreased during the recovery from the fever response (30-60 min). Hence the phenomenon of PGE2-elicited down-regulation of POA gabr gene expression alternatively contributes to recovery from fever (a decrease in body temperature); because of the reduced number of GABAA receptors, the EP3-expressing neurons could become insensitive to negative regulation by GABA. Further analysis should be conducted to address these points. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PGE2-EP3 signaling attenuates GABAA gene expression within the POA via a PT-sensitive pathway in close association with fever generation. These results will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying PGE2-induced fever generation and GABA-elicited thermal regulation in the central nervous system.
