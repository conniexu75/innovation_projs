https://openalex.org/W1992680765,"Reversal of the kyanite-sillimanite inversion has been accomplished hydrothermally at 750 degrees C. The inversion pressure at 750 degrees C is 8.1 +/- 0.4 kilobars. The calculated pressuretemperature slope at this point is 17.7+/- 1.0 bars per degree celsius. Geologically, this result seems more plausible than previous estimates of the location of the boundary. When combined with other work on the relative stability of andalusite, the data indicate that andalulsite cannot be stable at a pressure greater than 4.2 kilobars."
https://openalex.org/W1979113647,"Pairs of radio sources which are separated by from 2 degrees to 6 degrees on the sky have been investigated. In a number of cases peculiar galaxies have been found approximately midway along a line joining the two radio sources. The central peculiar galaxies belong mainly to a certain class in the recently compiled Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Among the radio sources so far associated with the peculiar galaxies are at least five known quasars. These quasars are indicated to be not at cosmological distances (that is, red shifts not caused by expansion of the universe) because the central peculiar galaxies are only at distances of 10 to 100 megaparsecs. The absolute magnitudes of these quasars are indicated to be in the range of brightness of normal galaxies and downward. Some of the radio sources which have been found to be associated with peculiar galaxies are galaxies themselves. It is therefore implied that ejection of material took place within or near the parent peculiar galaxies with speeds between 10(2) and 10(4) kilometers per second. After traveling for times of the order of 10(7) to 10(9) years, the luminous matter (galaxies) and radio sources (plasma) have reached their observed separations from the central peculiar galaxy. The large red shifts measured for the quasars would seem to be either (i) gravitational, (ii) collapse velocities of clouds of material falling toward the center of these compact galaxies, or (iii) some as yet unknown cause."

When the coenzyme was added to the shoots, the rate of carbon dioxide production during photosynthesis increased. Shoots of wheat or oats did not lack the coenzyme."
