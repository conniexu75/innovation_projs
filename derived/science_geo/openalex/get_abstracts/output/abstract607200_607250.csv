https://openalex.org/W2790418340,"In this study Illumina MiSeq was performed to investigate microbial diversity in soil, leaves, grape, grape juice and wine. A total of 1,043,102 fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) reads and 2,422,188 high quality bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were used for taxonomic classification, revealed five fungal and eight bacterial phyla. At the genus level, the dominant fungi were Ascomycota, Sordariales, Tetracladium and Geomyces in soil, Aureobasidium and Pleosporaceae in grapes leaves, Aureobasidium in grape and grape juice. The dominant bacteria were Kaistobacter, Arthrobacter, Skermanella and Sphingomonas in soil, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Kaistobacter in grape and grapes leaves, and Oenococcus in grape juice and wine. Principal coordinate analysis showed structural separation between the composition of fungi and bacteria in all samples. This is the first study to understand microbiome population in soil, grape, grapes leaves, grape juice and wine in Xinjiang through High-throughput Sequencing and identify microorganisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Oenococcus spp. that may contribute to the quality and flavor of wine."
https://openalex.org/W2758164845,"Verifying that a statistically significant result is scientifically meaningful is not only good scientific practice, it is a natural way to control the Type I error rate. Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value—a second-generation p-value (pδ)–that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (pδ = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (pδ = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 < pδ < 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2791279497,"The annual return of beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas, to traditional seasonal locations across the Arctic may involve migratory culture, while the convergence of discrete summering aggregations on common wintering grounds may facilitate outbreeding. Natal philopatry and cultural inheritance, however, has been difficult to assess as earlier studies were of too short a duration, while genetic analyses of breeding patterns, especially across the beluga’s Pacific range, have been hampered by inadequate sampling and sparse information on wintering areas. Using a much expanded sample and genetic marker set comprising 1,647 whales, spanning more than two decades and encompassing all major coastal summering aggregations in the Pacific Ocean, we found evolutionary-level divergence among three geographic regions: the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Φst = 0.11–0.32, Rst = 0.09–0.13), and likely demographic independence of (Fst-mtDNA = 0.02–0.66), and in many cases limited gene flow (Fst-nDNA = 0.0–0.02; K = 5–6) among, summering groups within regions. Assignment tests identified few immigrants within summering aggregations, linked migrating groups to specific summering areas, and found that some migratory corridors comprise whales from multiple subpopulations (PBAYES = 0.31:0.69). Further, dispersal is male-biased and substantial numbers of closely related whales congregate together at coastal summering areas. Stable patterns of heterogeneity between areas and consistently high proportions (~20%) of close kin (including parent-offspring) sampled up to 20 years apart within areas (G = 0.2–2.9, p>0.5) is the first direct evidence of natal philopatry to migration destinations in belugas. Using recent satellite telemetry findings on belugas we found that the spatial proximity of winter ranges has a greater influence on the degree of both individual and genetic exchange than summer ranges (rwinter-Fst-mtDNA = 0.9, rsummer-Fst-nDNA = 0.1). These findings indicate widespread natal philopatry to summering aggregation and entire migratory circuits, and provide compelling evidence that migratory culture and kinship helps maintain demographically discrete beluga stocks that can overlap in time and space."

Because PCOS is closely linked to obesity, we investigated the impact of an adverse hormonal or metabolic maternal environment and offspring obesity on anxiety in the offspring. The obese PCOS phenotype was induced by chronic high-fat-high-sucrose (HFHS) consumption together with prenatal dihydrotestosterone exposure in mouse dams. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in adult offspring with the elevated-plus maze and open-field tests. The influence of maternal androgens and maternal and offspring diet on genes implicated in anxiety were analyzed in the amygdala and hypothalamus with real-time PCR (n = 47). Independent of diet, female offspring exposed to maternal androgens were more anxious and displayed up-regulation of adrenoceptor a 1B in the amygdala and up-regulation of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hor-mone (Crh). By contrast, male offspring exposed to a HFHS maternal diet had increased anxiety-like behavior and showed up-regulation of epigenetic markers in the amygdala and up-regulation of hypothalamic Crh. Overall, there were substantial sex differences in gene expression in the brain. These findings provide novel insight into how maternal androgens and obesity exert sex-specific effects on behavior and gene expression in the offspring of a PCOS mouse model.—Manti, M., Fornes, R., Qi, X., Folmerz, E., Lindén Hirschberg A., de Castro Barbosa T., Maliqueo, M., Benrick, A., Stener-Victorin E.

https://openalex.org/W2791827015,"Malaria is a vector-borne infectious disease, caused by five different species of the genus Plasmodium, and is endemic to many tropical and sub-tropical countries of the globe. At present, malaria diagnosis at the primary health care level in India is conducted by either microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT). In recent years, molecular diagnosis (by PCR assay), has emerged as the most sensitive method for malaria diagnosis. India is highly endemic to malaria and shoulders the burden of two major malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Previous studies using PCR diagnostic assay had unraveled several interesting facts on distribution of malaria parasites in India. However, these studies had several limitations from small sample size to limited geographical areas of sampling. In order to mitigate these limitations, we have collected finger-prick blood samples from 2,333 malaria symptomatic individuals in nine states from 11 geographic locations, covering almost the entire malaria endemic regions of India and performed all the three diagnostic tests (microscopy, RDT and PCR assay) and also have conducted comparative assessment on the performance of the three diagnostic tests. Since PCR assay turned out to be highly sensitive (827 malaria positive cases) among the three types of tests, we have utilized data from PCR diagnostic assay for analyses and inferences. The results indicate varied distributional prevalence of P. vivax and P. falciparum according to locations in India, and also the mixed species infection due to these two species. The proportion of P. falciparum to P. vivax was found to be 49:51, and percentage of mixed species infections due to these two parasites was found to be 13% of total infections. Considering India is set for malaria elimination by 2030, the present malaria epidemiological information is of high importance."
https://openalex.org/W2793922718,"Background The inFLUenza Patient Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) measure is a daily diary assessing signs/symptoms of influenza across six body systems: Nose, Throat, Eyes, Chest/Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Body/Systemic, developed and tested in adults with influenza. Objectives This study tested the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of FLU-PRO scores in adults with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods Data from the prospective, observational study used to develop and test the FLU-PRO in influenza virus positive patients were analyzed. Adults (≥18 years) presenting with influenza symptoms in outpatient settings in the US, UK, Mexico, and South America were enrolled, tested for influenza virus, and asked to complete the 37-item draft FLU-PRO daily for up to 14-days. Analyses were performed on data from patients testing negative. Reliability of the final, 32-item FLU-PRO was estimated using Cronbach’s alpha (α; Day 1) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; 2-day reproducibility). Convergent and known-groups validity were assessed using patient global assessments of influenza severity (PGA). Patient report of return to usual health was used to assess responsiveness (Day 1–7). Results The analytical sample included 220 ILI patients (mean age = 39.3, 64.1% female, 88.6% white). Sixty-one (28%) were hospitalized at some point in their illness. Internal consistency reliability (α) of FLU-PRO Total score was 0.90 and ranged from 0.72–0.86 for domain scores. Reproducibility (Day 1–2) was 0.64 for Total, ranging from 0.46–0.78 for domain scores. Day 1 FLU-PRO scores correlated (≥0.30) with the PGA (except Gastrointestinal) and were significantly different across PGA severity groups (Total: F = 81.7, p<0.001; subscales: F = 6.9–62.2; p<0.01). Mean score improvements Day 1–7 were significantly greater in patients reporting return to usual health compared with those who did not (p<0.05, Total and subscales, except Gastrointestinal and Eyes). Conclusions Results suggest FLU-PRO scores are reliable, valid, and responsive in adults with influenza-like illness."
https://openalex.org/W2949167031,"The recent range expansion of human babesiosis in the northeastern United States, once found only in restricted coastal sites, is not well understood. This study sought to utilize a large number of samples to examine the population structure of the parasites on a fine scale to provide insights into the mode of emergence across the region. 228 B. microti samples collected in endemic northeastern U.S. sites were genotyped using published Variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. The genetic diversity and population structure were analysed on a geographic scale using Phyloviz and TESS, programs that utilize two different methods to identify population membership without predefined population data. Three distinct populations were detected in northeastern US, each dominated by a single ancestral type. In contrast to the limited range of the Nantucket and Cape Cod populations, the mainland population dominated from New Jersey eastward to Boston. Ancestral populations of B. microti were sufficiently isolated to differentiate into distinct populations. Despite this, a single population was detected across a large geographic area of the northeast that historically had at least 3 distinct foci of transmission, central New Jersey, Long Island and southeastern Connecticut. We conclude that a single B. microti genotype has expanded across the northeastern U.S. The biological attributes associated with this parasite genotype that have contributed to such a selective sweep remain to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W2791504253,"Until recently, the method of choice to characterize viral diversity consisted in cloning PCR amplicons of full-length viral genomes and Sanger-sequencing of multiple clones. However, this is extremely laborious, time-consuming, and low-throughput. Next generation short-read sequencing appears also limited by its inability to directly sequence full-length viral genomes. The MinION™ device recently developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies can be a promising alternative by applying long-read single-molecule sequencing directly to the overall amplified products generated in a PCR reaction. This new technology was evaluated by using hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a model. Several previously characterized HBV-infected clinical samples were investigated including recombinant virus, variants that harbored deletions and mixed population. Original MinION device was able to generate individual complete 3,200-nt HBV genome sequences and to identify recombinant variants. MinION was particularly efficient in detecting HBV genomes with multiple large in-frame deletions and spliced variants concomitantly with non-deleted parental genomes. However, an average-12% sequencing error rate per individual reads associated to a low throughput challenged single-nucleotide resolution, polymorphism calling and phasing mutations directly from the sequencing reads. Despite this high error rate, the pairwise identity of MinION HBV consensus genome was consistent with Sanger sequencing method. MinION being under continuous development, further studies are needed to evaluate its potential use for viral infection characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2791885451,"Background Healthcare students are future health care providers and serve as role models and coaches to enhance behaviors for healthy lifestyles. However healthcare students face multiple stressors that could lead to adopting risk behaviors. Objectives To assess the changes in health risk factors among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015, and to identify specific health behaviors based on the curriculum in a population of healthcare students: Methods Two cross sectionnal studies were conducted in 2007 and 2015 among nursing, medical, pharmacy, and physiotherapy students (Rouen, France). During compulsory courses and examination sessions students filled self-administered questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics and behavior as: tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, cannabis consumption, eating disorders, regular practice of sport, perceived health, stress and use of psychotropic drugs. Results 2,605 healthcare students were included (1,326 in 2007 and 1,279 in 2015), comprising 1,225 medical students (47.0%), 738 nursing students (28.3%), 362 pharmacy students (13.9%), and 280 physiotherapy students (10.8%). Between 2007 and 2015, occasional binge drinking and regular practice of sport increased significantly among healthcare students, respectively AOR = 1.48 CI95% (1.20–1.83) and AOR = 1.33 CI95% (1.11–1.60), regular cannabis consumption decreased significantly, AOR = 0.32 CI95% (0.19–0.54). There was no change in smoking or overweight/obese. There was a higher risk of frequent binge drinking and a lower risk of tobacco smoking in all curricula than in nursing students. Medical students practiced sport on a more regular basis, were less overweight/obese, had fewer eating disorders than nursing students. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a stable frequency of classic behaviors as smoking but a worsening of emerging behaviors as binge drinking among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015. Health behaviors differed according to healthcare curricula and nursing students demonstrated higher risks. As health behaviors are positively related to favorable attitudes towards preventive counseling, therefore healthcare students should receive training in preventive counseling and develop healthy lifestyles targeted according to the health curriculum."
https://openalex.org/W2793648334,"Objectives Influenza vaccination (IV) coverage remains low in France. Objectives were to assess patient knowledge and behaviors and missed opportunities for vaccination (MO) and their impact on vaccine uptake. Methods This is a prospective-observational study, including emergency department patients at risk for severe influenza. Patients were interviewed about their knowledge and behaviors. We evaluated the health-care voucher scheme (HCVS) and MO. Results 868 patients were included. Vaccine uptake was 33.2%, 42% of patients knew about the possible severity of influenza, 23% thought that they were not at risk for severe influenza, 39% knew that they have an indication for the vaccine, and 4.3% to 11.5% expressed reservations concerning IV side effects and effectiveness. HCVS was used by 44.3% of patients, but only 14.8% had been vaccinated. MO were reported by 484 patients (69.4%) declaring 1104 consultations and 148 IV propositions (86.6%). Predictors of vaccine uptake (p<0.0001) were: knowledge of serious and fatal influenza forms [OR 0.36 (CI95% 0.25–0.5)]; confidence in influenza vaccine effectiveness [0.38 (0.2–0.7)]; opposition to vaccines [0.22 (0.1–0.48)]; visit to general practitioner [4.53 (2.9–7.1)]; general practitioner proposed IV [2.1 (1.2–3.4)]. Conclusion Our results indicate that high rate of missed opportunities, some patient behaviors and general practitioner visits may explain low influenza vaccine uptake, and that HCVS use is a complex process. Of interest, we found that the patient’s knowledge of the potential severity of influenza is not sufficient to promote vaccine, suggesting that the information strategy must be adapted to each patient behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2791045308,"Amyloid aggregates of the protein α-synuclein (αS) called Lewy Bodies (LB) and Lewy Neurites (LN) are the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. We have previously shown that high extracellular αS concentrations can be toxic to cells and that neurons take up αS. Here we aimed to get more insight into the toxicity mechanism associated with high extracellular αS concentrations (50-100 μM). High extracellular αS concentrations resulted in a reduction of the firing rate of the neuronal network by disrupting synaptic transmission, while the neuronal ability to fire action potentials was still intact. Furthermore, many cells developed αS deposits larger than 500 nm within five days, but otherwise appeared healthy. Synaptic dysfunction clearly occurred before the establishment of large intracellular deposits and neuronal death, suggesting that an excessive extracellular αS concentration caused synaptic failure and which later possibly contributed to neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W2791329602,"Critical Habitat has become an increasingly important concept used by the finance sector and businesses to identify areas of high biodiversity value. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) defines Critical Habitat in their highly influential Performance Standard 6 (PS6), requiring projects in Critical Habitat to achieve a net gain of biodiversity. Here we present a global screening layer of Critical Habitat in the terrestrial realm, derived from global spatial datasets covering the distributions of 12 biodiversity features aligned with guidance provided by the IFC. Each biodiversity feature is categorised as 'likely' or 'potential' Critical Habitat based on: 1. Alignment between the biodiversity feature and the IFC Critical Habitat definition; and 2. Suitability of the spatial resolution for indicating a feature's presence on the ground. Following the initial screening process, Critical Habitat must then be assessed in-situ by a qualified assessor. This analysis indicates that a total of 10% and 5% of the global terrestrial environment can be considered as likely and potential Critical Habitat, respectively, while the remaining 85% did not overlap with any of the biodiversity features assessed and was classified as 'unknown'. Likely Critical Habitat was determined principally by the occurrence of Key Biodiversity Areas and Protected Areas. Potential Critical Habitat was predominantly characterised by data representing highly threatened and unique ecosystems such as ever-wet tropical forests and tropical dry forests. The areas we identified as likely or potential Critical Habitat are based on the best available global-scale data for the terrestrial realm that is aligned with IFC's Critical Habitat definition. Our results can help businesses screen potential development sites at the early project stage based on a range of biodiversity features. However, the study also demonstrates several important data gaps and highlights the need to incorporate new and improved global spatial datasets as they become available."
https://openalex.org/W2792843635,"Vancomycin-variable enterococci (VVE) are vanA-positive, vancomycin-susceptible enterococci with the ability to revert to a vancomycin-resistant phenotype on exposure to vancomycin. We sought to assess the prevalence of VVE and to determine clinical characteristics of patients infected with VVE. We prospectively collected Enterococcus faecium sterile site isolates from Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network hospitals from January 2015 to June 2016 and calculated VVE (defined as vanA-positive, vancomycin-susceptible isolates) prevalence among vanA-containing isolates. We performed chart reviews of VVE and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) bacteremias identified from January 2012 to June 2016, and on a random sample of patients with bacteremia due to vanA/vanB-negative, vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) from January 2015 to June 2016. Clinical characteristics were compared and factors associated with mortality assessed. Because of the potential reversion from VVE to VRE, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed for strains causing breakthrough bacteremia in order to identify relatedness among strains with different phenotypic resistance within the same patient. VVE comprised 47% (18/38) of vanA-positive isolates. The charts of 36 VRE, 25 VVE, and 79 VSE patients were reviewed. Central venous catheter associated bacteremia was more common in VVE (44%) and VRE patients (57%) than in VSE patients (28%) (P = 0.01). The Pitt bacteremia (OR 1.3, P = 0.002) and the Charlson score (OR 1.2, P = 0.008) were the only independent mortality predictors. PFGE of strains causing breakthrough bacteremia showed high within-patient clonality, irrespective of vanA-positivity or vancomycin-susceptibility. A substantial proportion of vanA-positive isolates are VVE and are therefore not detected with conventional selective culture methods. Bacteremia sources of patients with VVE are similar to those infected with VRE. We detected no association between VVE and 30-day mortality or breakthrough bacteremia."
https://openalex.org/W2790795380,"Determining the most likely source of an invasive pest species might help to improve their management by establishing efficient quarantine measures and heading the search of efficient biological control agents. Planococcus ficus is an invasive mealybug pest of vineyards in Argentina, California, Mexico, Peru and South Africa. This mealybug pest had a previously known geographic distribution spanning southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of northern Africa. In North America, Pl. ficus was first discovered in the early 1990s and soon thereafter in Mexico. To determine the origin of invasive populations in North America, Pl. ficus from California and Mexico were compared with material throughout its presumptive native range in the Mediterranean region, as well as material collected from an older invasion in South Africa and recently invaded Argentina. From each sample location, genomic DNA was sequenced for the nuclear internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c. oxidase one (CO1). Phylogenetic analyses of CO1, ITS1 and concatenated CO1 and ITS1 data-sets using Bayesian and neighbor-joining analysis support two major divisions: a European grouping (Europe, Tunisia, Turkey) and a Middle Eastern grouping (Israel and Egypt). The invasive populations in Argentina and South Africa align with the European group and the invasive populations in North America align with the Middle Eastern group, with one Israel sample aligning closely with the North American clade, suggesting that Israel was the origin of those populations."
https://openalex.org/W2791622307,"Our recent studies suggested that the freezability of carp semen is related to seminal plasma protein profiles. Here, we aimed to compare the spermatozoa proteomes of good (GF) and poor (PF) freezability semen of carp. To achieve this, we used two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The semen was classified as GF or PF based on sperm motility after freeze/thawing. We identified proteins enriched in spermatozoa of GF (22 proteins) and PF (18 proteins) semen. We also identified 12 proteins enriched in the supernatant after cryopreservation of PF semen. Good freezability is related to high concentrations of proteins involved in the maintenance of flagella structure, membrane fluidity, efficient control of Ca2+ and sperm motility, energy production, and antioxidative protection, which likely reflects the full maturation status of spermatozoa of GF semen. On the other hand poor freezability seems to be related to the presence of proteins identified as released in high quantities from cryopreserved sperm of PF. Thus, the identified proteins might be useful bioindicators of freezing resilience and could be used to screen carp males before cryopreservation, thus improve long-term sperm preservation in carp. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008187."
https://openalex.org/W2790186255,"Background Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in children and is associated with neurological complications such as seizures and encephalopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the presentation and complications of rotavirus compared to non-rotavirus gastroenteritis in UK children. Methods This was a retrospective, case-control, hospital-based study conducted at three sites in east London, UK. Cases were children aged 1 month to 16 years diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2013, in whom stool virology investigations confirmed presence of rotavirus by PCR. They were matched by age, gender and month of presentation to controls with rotavirus-negative gastroenteritis. Results Data were collected from 116 children (50 cases and 66 controls). Children with rotavirus gastroenteritis tended to present more frequently with metabolic acidosis (pH 7.30 vs 7.37, P = 0.011) and fever (74% versus 46%; P = 0.005) and were more likely to require hospitalisation compared to children with non-rotavirus gastroenteritis (93% versus 73%; P = 0.019). Neurological complications were the most common extra-intestinal manifestations, but did not differ significantly between children with rotavirus-positive gastroenteritis (RPG) and rotavirus-negative gastroenteritis (RNG) (24% versus 15%, respectively; P = 0.24). Encephalopathy occurred only in children with rotavirus infection (n = 3, 6%). Conclusion Rotavirus causes longer and more severe disease compared to other viral pathogens. Seizures and milder neurological signs were surprisingly common and associated with multiple pathogens, but encephalopathy occurred only in children with rotavirus gastroenteritis. Rotavirus vaccination may reduce seizures and presentation to hospital, but vaccines against other pathogens causing gastroenteritis are required."
https://openalex.org/W2792442279,"Arctic ecosystems are characterized by a broad range of plant functional types that are highly heterogeneous at small (~1–2 m) spatial scales. Climatic changes can impact vegetation distribution directly, and also indirectly via impacts on disturbance regimes. Consequent changes in vegetation structure and function have implications for surface energy dynamics that may alter permafrost thermal dynamics, and are therefore of interest in the context of permafrost related climate feedbacks. In this study we examine small-scale heterogeneity in soil thermal properties and ecosystem carbon and water fluxes associated with varying understory vegetation in open-canopy larch forests in northeastern Siberia. We found that lichen mats comprise 16% of understory vegetation cover on average in open canopy larch forests, and lichen abundance was inversely related to canopy cover. Relative to adjacent areas dominated by shrubs and moss, lichen mats had 2–3 times deeper permafrost thaw depths and surface soils warmer by 1–2°C in summer and less than 1°C in autumn. Despite deeper thaw depths, ecosystem respiration did not differ across vegetation types, indicating that autotrophic respiration likely dominates areas with shrubs and moss. Summertime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was negative (i.e. net uptake) in areas with high shrub cover, while positive (i.e. net loss) in lichen mats and areas with less shrub cover. Our results highlight relationships between vegetation and soil thermal dynamics in permafrost ecosystems, and underscore the necessity of considering both vegetation and permafrost dynamics in shaping carbon cycling in permafrost ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2791133320,"RAF kinases are a family of enzymes in the MAP kinase pathway that contribute to the development of different types of cancer. BRAF is the most important member of RAF kinases. BRAF mutations have been detected in 7% of all cancers and 66% of melanomas; as such, the FDA has approved a few BRAF inhibitor drugs to date. However, BRAF can activate CRAF leading to resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Berberine (BBR) is an alkaloid that is widely distributed in different plant species. Several studies have been carried out on the anti-cancer effects of BBR but direct targets of BBR are unknown. In this study, interactions of BBR derivatives against BRAF and CRAF kinases were modeled and predicted using an in silico-based approach. To analyze and identify the residues important in BRAF docking, we modeled interactions of ATP, the universal substrate of BRAF, and found that Lys483 and Asp594 are the most important residues involved in both ATP and BBR binding [(The average score = -11.5 kcal/mol (ATP); Range of scores = -7.78 to -9.55 kcal/mol (BBR)]. In addition to these polar residues, Trp530 and Phe583 are also applicable to the molecular docking of BRAF. We also observed that Asp593 was excluded from the enzyme cavity, while Phe594 was included inside the cavity, making the enzyme inactive. Finally, three alternatives for BBR were identified with dual RAF inhibition effects [The best scores against BRAF = -11.62 kcal/mol (BBR-7), -10.64 kcal/mol (BBR-9), and -11.01 kcal/mol (BBR-10); the best scores against CRAF = -9.68 kcal/mol (BBR-7), -9.60 kcal/mol (BBR-9), and -9.20 kcal/mol (BBR-10)]. Direct effects of BBR derivatives against BRAF and CRAF kinases had not yet been reported previously, and, thus, for the first time, we report three cycloprotoberberines as lead compounds against RAF kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2790293254,"Species richness is greater in places where the number of potential niches is high. Consequently, the niche may be fundamental for understanding the arrangement of life and especially, the establishment and maintenance of the well-known Latitudinal Biodiversity Gradient (LBG). However, not all potential niches may be occupied fully in a habitat, as measured by niche vacancy/saturation. Here, we theoretically reconstruct oceanic biodiversity and analyse modeled and observed data together to examine patterns in niche saturation (i.e. the ratio between observed and theoretical biodiversity of a given taxon) for several taxonomic groups. Our results led us to hypothesize that the arrangement of marine life is constrained by the distribution of the maximal number of species' niches available, which represents a fundamental mathematical limit to the number of species that can co-exist locally. We liken this arrangement to a type of chessboard where each square on the board is a geographic area, itself comprising a distinct number of sub-squares (species' niches). Each sub-square on the chessboard can accept a unique species of a given ecological guild, whose occurrence is determined by speciation/extinction. Because of the interaction between the thermal niche and changes in temperature, our study shows that the chessboard has more sub-squares at mid-latitudes and we suggest that many clades should exhibit a LBG because their probability of emergence should be higher in the tropics where more niches are available. Our work reveals that each taxonomic group has its own unique chessboard and that global niche saturation increases when organismal complexity decreases. As a result, the mathematical influence of the chessboard is likely to be more prominent for taxonomic groups with low (e.g. plankton) than great (e.g. mammals) biocomplexity. Our study therefore reveals the complex interplay between a fundamental mathematical constraint on biodiversity resulting from the interaction between the species' ecological niche and fluctuations in the environmental regime (here, temperature), which has a predictable component and a stochastic-like biological influence (diversification rates, origination and clade age) that may alter or blur the former."
https://openalex.org/W2791866909,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with modification of lipids profile and an increased risk of cardiovascular events related to inflammation. Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) exerts a lipid transfer activity through its active form. PLTP can also bind to receptors such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). In addition to its role in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, the latest advances came in support of a complex role of PLTP in the regulation of the inflammatory response, both with pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to decipher the role of PLTP in joint inflammation and to assess its relevance in the context of RA. PLTP expression was examined by western-blot and by immunochemistry. ABCA1 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Lipid transfer activity of PLTP and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in sera and synovial fluid (SF) from RA patients and controls (healthy subjects or osteoarthritis patients [OA]). FLS were treated with both lipid-transfer active form and inactive form of recombinant human PLTP. IL-8, IL-6, VEGF and MMP3 produced by FLS were assessed by ELISA, and proliferation by measuring 3H-Thymidine incorporation. RA synovial tissues showed higher PLTP staining than OA and PLTP protein levels were also significantly higher in RA-FLS. In addition, RA, unlike OA patients, displayed elevated levels of PLTP activity in SF, which correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both lipid-transfer active and inactive forms of PLTP significantly increased the production of cytokines and proliferation of FLS. ABCA1 was expressed on RAFLS and PLTP activated STAT3 pathway. To conclude, PLTP is highly expressed in the joints of RA patients and may directly trigger inflammation and FLS proliferation, independently of its lipid transfer activity. These results suggest a pro-inflammatory role for PLTP in RA."

Since it is unknown when this unfavorable composition develops, we compared body composition in disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)-naive early arthritis patients with non-arthritis controls and explored the association, in early arthritis patients, with disease activity and traditional cardiovascular risk factors.317 consecutive early arthritis patients (84% rheumatoid arthritis according to 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria) and 1268 age-/gender-/ethnicity-matched non-arthritis controls underwent a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan to assess fat percentage, fat mass index, fat mass distribution and appendicular lean (muscle) mass index. Additionally, disease activity, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), acute phase proteins, lipid profile and blood pressure were evaluated.Loss of muscle mass (corrected for age suspected muscle mass) was 4-5 times more common in early arthritis patients, with a significantly lower mean appendicular lean mass index (females 6% and males 7% lower, p<0.01). Patients had more fat distributed to the trunk (females p<0.01, males p = 0.07) and females had a 4% higher mean fat mass index (p<0.01). An unfavorable body composition was associated with a higher blood pressure and an atherogenic lipid profile. There was no relationship with disease activity, HAQ or acute phase proteins.Loss of muscle mass is 4-5 times more common in early arthritis patients, and is in early arthritis patients associated with a higher blood pressure and an atherogenic lipid profile. Therefore, cardiovascular risk is already increased at the clinical onset of arthritis making cardiovascular risk management necessary in early arthritis patients."

The formula lipid background was either a pure plant oil blend, or dairy fat with a plant oil blend (1:1). Results at weaning were compared to breast milk–fed pups. Brain functional activity was determined by positron emission tomography scan imaging, the brain and eye fatty acid and lipid composition by targeted and untargeted lipidomics, and DHA brain regional location by mass-spectrometry imaging. The brain functional activity was normalized to controls with DHA+ARA added to the formulas. DHA in both brain and eyes was influenced by formula intake, but more than two-thirds of tissue DHA-glycerolipids remained insensitive to the dietary challenge. However, the DHA lipidome correlated better with brain function than sole DHA content (r = 0.70 vs. r = 0.48; P < 0.05). Brain DHA regional distribution was more affected by the formula lipid background than the provision of PUFAs. Adding DHA+ARA to formulas alters the DHA content and lipidome of nervous tissue in the neonate, making it closer to dam milk-fed controls, and normalizes brain functional activity.—Aidoud, N., Delplanque, B., Baudry, C., Garcia, C., Moyon, A., Balasse, L., Guillet, B., Antona, C., Darmaun, D., Fraser, K., Ndiaye, S., Leruyet, P., Martin, J.-C.

https://openalex.org/W2790672507,"Although Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is poised to displace barcodes, security vulnerabilities pose serious challenges for global adoption of the RFID technology. Specifically, RFID tags are prone to basic cloning and counterfeiting security attacks. A successful cloning of the RFID tags in many commercial applications can lead to many serious problems such as financial losses, brand damage, safety and health of the public. With many industries such as pharmaceutical and businesses deploying RFID technology with a variety of products, it is important to tackle RFID tag cloning problem and improve the resistance of the RFID systems. To this end, we propose an approach for detecting cloned RFID tags in RFID systems with high detection accuracy and minimal overhead thus overcoming practical challenges in existing approaches. The proposed approach is based on consistency of dual hash collisions and modified count-min sketch vector. We evaluated the proposed approach through extensive experiments and compared it with existing baseline approaches in terms of execution time and detection accuracy under varying RFID tag cloning ratio. The results of the experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches in cloned RFID tag detection accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2792087926,"Although toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic infections worldwide, therapeutic options remain limited. Cathepsins, proteases that play key roles in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis and many other protozoan infections, are important potential therapeutic targets. Because both TgCPB and TgCPL play a role in T. gondii invasion, we evaluated the efficacy of the potent, irreversible vinyl sulfone inhibitor, K11777 (N-methyl-piperazine-Phe-homoPhe-vinylsulfone-phenyl). The inhibitor’s toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile have been well-studied because of its in vitro and in vivo activity against a number of parasites. We found that it inhibited both TgCPB (EC50 = 114 nM) and TgCPL (EC50 = 71 nM) in vitro. K11777 also inhibited invasion of human fibroblasts by RH tachyzoites by 71% (p = 0.003) and intracellular replication by >99% (p<0.0001). In vivo, a single dose of K11777 led to 100% survival of chicken embryos in an model of acute toxoplasmosis (p = 0.015 Cox regression analysis). Therefore, K11777 shows promise as a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, and may prove to be a broadly effective anti-parasitic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2793307158,"Biometric recognition is currently implemented in several authentication contexts, most recently in mobile devices where it is expected to complement or even replace traditional authentication modalities such as PIN (Personal Identification Number) or passwords. The assumed convenience characteristics of biometrics are transparency, reliability and ease-of-use, however, the question of whether biometric recognition is as intuitive and straightforward to use is open to debate. Can biometric systems make some tasks easier for people with accessibility concerns? To investigate this question, an accessibility evaluation of a mobile app was conducted where test subjects withdraw money from a fictitious ATM (Automated Teller Machine) scenario. The biometric authentication mechanisms used include face, voice, and fingerprint. Furthermore, we employed traditional modalities of PIN and pattern in order to check if biometric recognition is indeed a real improvement. The trial test subjects within this work were people with real-life accessibility concerns. A group of people without accessibility concerns also participated, providing a baseline performance. Experimental results are presented concerning performance, HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and accessibility, grouped according to category of accessibility concern. Our results reveal links between individual modalities and user category establishing guidelines for future accessible biometric products."
https://openalex.org/W2789594189,"Background No studies have reported the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and concurrent cerebral artery and coronary artery atherosclerosis simultaneously. We aimed at determining whether NAFLD, as assessed by ultrasound, is associated with subclinical cerebro-cardio vascular atherosclerosis (CCVA) by multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), and high resolution—magnetic resonance angiography (HR-MRA). This cross-sectional study included men in the general Korean population aged 20–70 years. Results A total of 1,652 men participated in the study (normal, n = 835; mild-to-moderate NAFLD, n = 512; severe NAFLD, n = 305). The risk of subclinical CCVA was positively associated with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.068; 1.054–1.081, p < 0.001), body mass index (OR 1.120; 1.08 0–1.162, p < 0.001), hepatic enzyme levels (OR 1.012; 1.001–1.023, p = 0.027; OR 1.006; 1.001–1.012, p = 0.036), fasting glucose (OR 1.021; 1.015–1.027, p < 0.001), triglycerides (OR 1.002; 1.000–1.003, p = 0.016), hypertension (OR 2.836; 2.268–3.546, p < 0.001), and diabetes (OR 2.911; 2.137–3.964, p < 0.001). Also, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely associated with subclinical CCVA (OR 0.974; 0.965–0.982, p < 0.001). Compared with normal controls, the OR for subclinical CCVA after full adjustment was 1.46 in the mild-to-moderate NAFLD group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.93) and 2.04 in the severe NAFLD group (95% CI: 1.44 to 2.89). Conclusions Our data show that NAFLD is common among Korean men, and NAFLD severity on ultrasonography is associated with subclinical CCVA, as assessed by MDCT, and HR-MRA."
https://openalex.org/W2792735064,"Testosterone is essential for spermatogenesis and the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics in males. An important transcription factor, LIM-homeobox gene 9 (Lhx9) is indispensable for testis development and testosterone production; however, post-translational modifications of Lhx9 are largely unknown. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate that the level of Lhx9 protein increases in human chorionic gonadotropin-exposed Leydig cells and can be polyubiquitylated. We found that Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets Lhx9 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation, thereby negatively modulating its function. Increasing Smurf1 decreases the level of Lhx9 and inhibits the Lhx9 trans-activation capacity of steroidogenic factor 1 [nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1 (NR5A1)]. In contrast, the depletion of Smurf1 leads to increased expression of Lhx9 protein and enhances testosterone biosynthesis-related gene transcripts [NR5A1, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, CYP17A1, hydroxy-δ-5-steroid dehydrogenase, hydroxy-δ-5-steroid dehydrogenase isomerase 6, and hydroxysteroid (17-β) dehydrogenase 3] and testosterone production in Leydig cells. Furthermore, we found that Smurf1 knockout mice exhibit higher levels of Lhx9 protein and steroidogenesis, which leads to increased serum testosterone concentration. These findings reveal that Smurf1 promotes Lhx9 ubiquitylation and is involved in testosterone production in Leydig cells directly. Our results provide new insights into the molecular events that play a role in the homeostasis of testosterone levels and may provide a new target for testosterone regulation.—Hu, F., Zhu, Q., Sun, B., Cui, C., Li, C., Zhang, L.

https://openalex.org/W2792275004,"The complex morphologies observed in many biofilms play a critical role in the survival of these microbial communities. Recently, the formation of wrinkles has been the focus of many studies aimed at finding fundamental information on morphogenesis during development. While the underlying genetic mechanisms of wrinkling are not well-understood, recent discoveries have led to the counterintuitive idea that wrinkle formation is triggered by localized cell death. This work examines the hypothesis that the material properties of a biofilm both power and control wrinkle formation within biofilms in response to localized cell death. Using an agent-based model and a high-performance platform (Biocellion), we built a model that qualitatively reproduced wrinkle formation in biofilms due to cell death. Through the use of computational simulations, we determined important relationships between cellular level mechanical interactions and changes in colony morphology. These simulations were also used to identify significant cellular interactions that are required for wrinkle formation. These results are a first step towards more comprehensive models that, in combination with experimental observations, will improve our understanding of the morphological development of bacterial biofilms."

https://openalex.org/W2790083389,"The objective of this study was to assess the validity of the self-/home-measured waist circumference (WC) method in children/adolescents at three sites: at the level of the umbilicus, immediately above the iliac crest, and at the midpoint of the lower margin of the last palpable rib and top of the iliac crest. A cross-sectional study of 3360 Hong Kong Chinese children/adolescents was conducted, with 2980 (88.7%) participants included in the final analysis. The WC of children aged 6 to 9 was measured at the three sites by their parent/guardian at home followed by measurement by trained assessors at school within one week. Children/adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 self-measured their WC at the three sites during school hours, followed by measurements by the trained assessors. Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA) analysis was performed to evaluate between-measurement agreement. The difference between assessor- and self-/home-measured WC was defined as ≤ ±2.5 cm for the upper and lower LOA at all three sites as an a priori criterion based on the assessor-measured inter-rater results. The results showed that most measurements (about 96%) at each site was within 95% of the LOA. Of the three measurement sites, the smallest LOA interval width was found at the umbilicus site, with an upper LOA of 5.08 and 7.13 and lower LOA of -2.61 and -3.43 in boys and girls, respectively. In conclusion, the range of LOA was relatively large, exceeding the acceptable limits of the predefined a priori criterion of upper and lower LOA, and thus suggesting disagreement between the two measurement methods. The use of WC as a measure of abdominal obesity in clinical practice/epidemiological studies should be restricted to measurement by trained health professionals/research staff."
https://openalex.org/W2791701786,"To investigate incidence, rationales, related factors and outcomes for changing from appropriate catheter placement to inappropriate use among hospitalized older patients in the emergency department.A secondary analysis was adopted from a longitudinal study that was designed to follow the lifecycle of the urinary catheter among hospitalized older patients. Patients aged 65 and older with a urinary catheter that had been placed in the emergency department were included. Demographic factors, present health conditions, conditional factors of catheter placement, and rationales for daily urinary catheter use were collected from the original data. Inappropriate urinary catheter days were evaluated as an outcome.Appropriate urinary catheters were placed in the emergency department in 117 of the 156 patients (75%). Of these patients, 77 patients (65.8%) experienced a change from appropriate placement to inappropriate use, with a mean duration of 2.88±1.56 days. The common rationales were post-operation for hip fracture (36.3%) and no longer needing to monitor urine output (27.2%). A hierarchical regression model shows that a change from appropriate catheter placement to inappropriate use was associated with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (OR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.77; p = 0.02) and no record of the indication for catheter placement (OR = 4.76; 95% CI = 1.20-18.90; p = 0.02), and all variables together explained 35.9% of the variance. In addition, a change from appropriate placement to inappropriate use was further associated with prolonging inappropriate catheter-days (β = 5.34; 95% CI: 3.72-6.97; p <0.001).The study highlights a considerable percentage of change from appropriate placement to inappropriate use. Efforts to construct reminder intervention, to improve the record of catheter placement and continued attention to catheter use are necessary to reduce inappropriate urinary catheter use."
https://openalex.org/W2791956356,"Objective Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history. Methods In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (n = 324) and college students (n = 138 and n = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 & 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s d were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits. Results Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%). Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing. Survivors dating widowed people and survivors in active follow-up could expect more hesitant reactions and should disclose earlier."
https://openalex.org/W2793920210,"A model algorithm is proposed to imitate a series of of consecutive conflicts between leaders in social groups. The leaders are represented by local hubs, i.e., nodes with highest node degrees. We simulate subsequent hierarchical partitions of a complex connected network which represents a social structure. The partitions are supposed to appear as actions of members of two conflicted groups surrounding two strongest leaders. According to the model, links at the shortest path between the rival leaders are successively removed. When the group is split into two disjoint parts then each part is further divided as the initial network. The algorithm is stopped, if in all parts a distance from a local leader to any node in his group is shorter than three links. The numerically calculated size distribution of resulting fragments of scale-free Barabási-Albert networks reveals one largest fragment which contains the original leader (hub of the network) and a number of small fragments with opponents that are described by two Weibull distributions. A mean field calculation of the size of the largest fragment is in a good agreement with numerical results. The model assumptions are validated by an application of the algorithm to the data on political blogs in U.S. (L. Adamic and N. Glance, Proc. WWW-2005). The obtained fragments are clearly polarized; either they belong to Democrats, or to Republicans. This result confirms that during conflicts, hubs are centers of polarization."
