Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such “autoencoder” networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data."

Much larger signals are detected when magnetic-dipole resonances are excited, as compared with purely electric-dipole resonances. The experiments are consistent with calculations based on the magnetic component of the Lorentz force exerted on metal electrons—an intrinsic second-harmonic generation mechanism that plays no role in natural materials. This unusual mechanism becomes relevant in our work as a result of the enhancement and the orientation of the local magnetic fields associated with the magnetic-dipole resonances of the split-ring resonators."

MutLα is required for mismatch repair, but its function in this process is unclear. We show that human MutLα is a latent endonuclease that is activated in a mismatch-, MutSα-, RFC-, PCNA-, and ATP-dependent manner. Incision of a nicked mismatch-containing DNA heteroduplex by this four-protein system is strongly biased to the nicked strand. A mismatch-containing DNA segment spanned by two strand breaks is removed by the 5′-to-3′ activity of MutSα-activated exonuclease I. The probable endonuclease active site has been localized to a PMS2 DQHA(X)2E(X)4E motif. This motif is conserved in eukaryotic PMS2 homologs and in MutL proteins from a number of bacterial species but is lacking in MutL proteins from bacteria that rely on d(GATC) methylation for strand discrimination in mismatch repair.

Inactivation of the human mismatch repair system increases the mutation rate several hundred-fold and is the primary cause of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Genetic stabilization afforded by this system has been attributed to its function in the correction of DNA biosynthetic errors, its role in ensuring the fidelity of genetic recombination, and its participation in the checkpoint and apoptotic responses to several classes of DNA damage (reviewed in Surtees et al., 2004Surtees J.A.

The mechanism of mismatch repair has been most extensively studied in E. coli, and the E. coli reaction has been reconstituted in a purified system (Kunkel and Erie, 2005Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. DNA mismatch repair.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, Iyer et al., 2006Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P. DNA mismatch repair: functions and mechanisms.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Repair is directed to the daughter strand at the replication fork by virtue of the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation in newly synthesized DNA. Repair is initiated by binding of MutS to a mismatch, and MutL is recruited to the heteroduplex DNA in a MutS- and ATP-dependent manner. Assembly of the MutL•MutS•heteroduplex ternary complex is sufficient to activate the d(GATC) endonuclease activity of MutH, which incises the unmethylated strand. The ensuing strand break is the actual signal that directs repair to the new DNA strand and serves as an entry point for the excision system, comprised of DNA helicase II and an appropriate single-strand exonuclease. A 3′-to-5′ exonuclease is required when the MutH nick is introduced 3′ to the mismatch, while a 5′-to-3′ hydrolytic activity is necessary when the MutH strand break is 5′ to the mispair. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme repairs the ensuing gap, and ligase restores covalent integrity to the helix. Mammalian cell extracts support a similar reaction in which repair is directed by a strand discontinuity (a nick or gap) that may also reside either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (Kunkel and Erie, 2005Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. DNA mismatch repair.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, Iyer et al., 2006Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.

The key proteins for initiation of eukaryotic mismatch repair are homologs of bacterial MutS and MutL. Eukaryotes harbor two mismatch recognition activities, MutSα (MSH2•MSH6 heterodimer) and MutSβ (MSH2•MSH3 heterodimer), although MutSα is probably responsible for most mismatch repair events in mammalian cells. Eukaryotic MutL homologs also function as heterodimers, with MLH1 serving as a common subunit. The best characterized of these has been MutLα, isolated from both human (MLH1•PMS2 heterodimer) and yeast (MLH1•PMS1 complex) (Prolla et al., 1994Prolla T.A. Pang Q. Alani E. Kolodner R.D.

Study of the mammalian extract reaction has implicated six activities in addition to MutSα, MutSβ, and MutLα in nick-directed mismatch repair: the PCNA replication clamp, the RFC clamp loader, the single-strand DNA binding protein RPA, exonuclease I (ExoI), DNA polymerase δ, and the DNA binding protein HMGB1 (Kunkel and Erie, 2005Kunkel T.A.

DNA mismatch repair: functions and mechanisms.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, ExoI, which hydrolyzes duplex DNA with 5′-to-3′ polarity in the absence of other proteins, is required for both 5′- and 3′-directed repair of G-T or G-G mismatches in extracts of human and mouse cells (Genschel et al., 2002Genschel J.

However, extracts of an ExoI−/− mouse cell line retain significant activity on single-nucleotide and dinucleotide insertion/deletion heteroduplexes, and HPRT mutability of such cells is elevated 30-fold, substantially less than the 150-fold increase conferred by MSH2 deficiency (Wei et al., 2003Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H.

Although the spectrum of HPRT mutations was not established in the Wei et al. study, these findings indicate that ExoI plays a major role in the MutSα-dependent repair of base-base mispairs, but also that alternate excision activities may function in insertion/deletion mismatch correction. These observations have led to several purified systems that support nick-directed mismatch-provoked excision and repair. The simplest of these consists of MutSα, MutLα, ExoI, and RPA (±HMGB1) (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2005Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Reconstitution of 5′-directed human mismatch repair in a purified system.Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis in this system is mismatch provoked but always proceeds 5′ to 3′ from the nick that directs excision. Although MutLα is not required in this system, it does enhance the mismatch dependence of the reaction by suppressing ExoI hydrolysis of mismatch-free DNA (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Supplementation of MutSα, MutLα, ExoI, and RPA with PCNA and RFC yields a system that supports bidirectional excision, i.e., excision directed by a nick located either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L.

Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast to the simpler 5′-to-3′ reaction, 3′-directed excision is absolutely dependent on MutLα, RFC, and PCNA. RFC apparently plays two roles in the activation of 3′-directed excision. It functions as a PCNA loader, with the loaded form of PCNA necessary to activate 3′-directed excision, but it also acts directly to suppress ExoI-mediated 5′-to-3′ hydrolysis from a nick or gap located 3′ to the mismatch (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L.

Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar; N.C. and P.M., unpublished data). Since the activities other than ExoI used in this study were free of exonuclease activity and because an ExoI active-site mutant did not support 3′-directed excision, hydrolysis in this system was attributed to ExoI (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. A defined human system that supports bidirectional mismatch-provoked excision.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Addition of DNA polymerase δ to these six components yields a system that supports mismatch repair in a reaction that can be directed by a strand break located 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (Constantin et al., 2005Constantin N. Dzantiev L. Kadyrov F.A. Modrich P. Human mismatch repair: Reconstitution of a nick-directed bidirectional reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39752-39761Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As observed for 5′-directed excision, 5′-directed repair in this system is MutLα independent but requires RFC and PCNA for the repair synthesis step of the reaction. The work described here clarifies the functions of MutLα and ExoI in human mismatch repair. We show that MutLα harbors a latent endonuclease that is activated in a mismatch-, MutSα-, RFC-, PCNA-, and ATP-dependent manner. Incision of a nicked heteroduplex by this four-protein system is strongly biased to the nicked strand. A mismatch-containing segment spanned by two strand breaks is then excised by the 5′-to-3′ action of MutSα-activated ExoI. Biochemical analysis of human mismatch repair has relied on the use of circular substrates containing a mismatch and a strand discontinuity (a nick or a gap) that directs the reaction. Because mismatch-provoked excision in nuclear extracts is restricted to the shorter path linking the two DNA sites (Fang and Modrich, 1993Fang W.-h. Modrich P. Human strand-specific mismatch repair occurs by a bidirectional mechanism similar to that of the bacterial reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), circular DNAs of this form are referred to as 3′ or 5′ heteroduplexes depending on whether the strand discontinuity resides 3′ or 5′ to the mispair, respectively, as viewed along the shorter path (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).Figure 2MutSα, MutLα, PCNA, and RFC Incise the Nicked Strand of 5′ Heteroduplex DNAShow full captionReactions and analysis were as in Figure 1, except that substrates were nicked 5′ G-T heteroduplex or 5′ G•C homoduplex.

We have previously shown that a system comprised of MutSα, MutLα, RFC, PCNA, ExoI, and RPA supports 3′-nick-directed mismatch-provoked excision (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. A defined human system that supports bidirectional mismatch-provoked excision.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments suggested that this reaction might involve MutSα-, MutLα-, RFC-, and PCNA-dependent endonucleolytic attack on the incised heteroduplex strand (data not shown). This was confirmed by Southern analysis after restriction endonuclease cleavage and resolution of DNA products on denaturing gels. The production of new DNA termini on a 3′ heteroduplex, as visualized by this method, is illustrated in Figure 1. Use of a radiolabeled probe complementary to the 3′ terminus of the nicked strand demonstrated the production of new DNA termini 5′ to the site of probe hybridization (Figure 1A). A mismatch, MutSα, MutLα, RFC, PCNA, and ATP were required for this effect, but RPA was not (lanes 1–7; see also Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Fifty percent of the products shown in Figure 1A range in size from 0.10 to 0.56 kb, although new termini as far as 3 kb from the original strand break were detectable (lanes 2 and 7). Because the nick-mismatch separation distance in this 3′ heteroduplex is 141 bp, these results imply that incision of this DNA occurred preferentially on the 5′ side of the mispair, although some incision 3′ to the mismatch also occurred. By contrast, the yield of these products was greatly reduced if ExoI was included in the reaction, as was the signal corresponding to the original heteroduplex 3′ terminus (Figure 1A, compare lane 8 with lanes 2 and 7). The nature of endonucleolytic incision by this system was also addressed using probes that hybridize to the nicked heteroduplex strand on either side of the ClaI site (Figures 1B and 1C). The experiment shown in Figure 1B probes the other end of the DNA fragment analyzed in Figure 1A, i.e., for the production of new 3′ termini within this DNA segment. Incision products obtained in the presence of MutSα, MutLα, RFC, and PCNA (±RPA) and visualized with this probe were consistent with those observed in Figure 1A. As noted above, the occurrence of new 5′ termini within the region bracketed by the 3′ heteroduplex strand break and the ClaI site was abolished when ExoI was included in the reaction (Figure 1A, lane 8). However, generation of new 3′ termini within this region was demonstrable under these conditions (Figure 1B, lane 8). Because the MutSα, MutLα, RFC, PCNA, and RPA preparations used in these experiments were free of detectable exonuclease activity (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. A defined human system that supports bidirectional mismatch-provoked excision.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar; Table S1), the simplest explanation for these results is that 5′ termini produced by the endonucleolytic action of the MutSα, MutLα, RFC, PCNA system serve as entry sites for 5′-to-3′ hydrolysis by MutSα-activated ExoI (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. A defined human system that supports bidirectional mismatch-provoked excision.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which excises the DNA segment between this site and the original heteroduplex strand break, thus eliminating the hybridization target of the oligonucleotide probe. Incubation of the 3′ heteroduplex with MutSα, MutLα, RFC, and PCNA (±RPA) also produced new termini on the 5′ side of the heteroduplex strand break (Figure 1C). However this effect was attenuated by ExoI, which led to the preferential elimination of those termini most distant from the mismatch (compare lane 8 with 2 and 7). A similar ExoI effect is evident in Figure 1B (lane 8 versus 2 and 7), and the products observed in the presence of ExoI in these two instances are similar to those observed previously in the defined 3′ excision system (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. A defined human system that supports bidirectional mismatch-provoked excision.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We think it unlikely that this preferential loss of distal termini is due to ExoI hydrolysis of hybridization target sequences in these cases. Rather, we attribute this effect to hydrolytic removal of the mismatch, which leads to cis inactivation of the endonucleolytic system. When inactivation in this manner does not occur, MutSα-, MutLα-, RFC-, and PCNA-dependent endonucleolytic incision is an ongoing process, and endonucleolytic events can occur several thousand bp from the mismatch. Additional evidence for this view is presented below. Endonucleolytic attack on the nicked 3′ heteroduplex DNA by this system was strongly biased to the nicked strand; incision of the continuous strand was limited to about 10% of that occurring on the nicked strand (Figure 1D; Table S1; see also below). Furthermore, covalently closed circular heteroduplex and homoduplex DNAs were resistant to incision by this system (Figure S1). The nicked strand of a 5′ G-T heteroduplex (nick and mismatch separated by 128 bp) was also subjected to incision in the presence of MutSα, MutLα, RFC, and PCNA (Figure 2). As observed with 3′ substrates, incision was mismatch dependent and occurred in the absence of RPA (Figures 2A–2C), and the continuous heteroduplex strand was resistant (incision was about 6% of that occurring on the nicked strand; compare Figure 2D with Figures 2A–2C; Table S1). Furthermore, supplementation of these proteins with ExoI abolished endonucleolytic product signals when the oligonucleotide used for end labeling was complementary to 5′ terminus at the nick that directs the reaction (Figure 2A, compare lane 8 with lanes 2 and 7). Presence of the exonuclease also attenuated incision events occurring in the vicinity of the ClaI site distal from the mismatch (Figures 2B and 2C, compare lane 8 with lanes 2 and 7). Table S1 quantifies the results of the incision reactions presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. As can be seen, 5′ and 3′ heteroduplexes are incised with similar efficiency and in a manner that is highly dependent on a mismatch, MutSα, MutLα, RFC, PCNA, and ATP. We have previously shown that MutSα, MutLα, ExoI, RFC, PCNA, and RPA are sufficient to support ATP-dependent excision directed by a strand break located 3′ to a mismatch. The experiments described above suggested that the endonucleolytic products produced in the presence of MutSα, MutLα, RFC, and PCNA are intermediates in this process. Indeed, the MutSα and MutLα dependence of the endonucleolytic reaction is similar to that of reconstituted 3′-directed excision (Figure S2), and homogeneous yeast RFC effectively substituted for human RFC in this system (Table S1), as it does in 3′-directed excision (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L.

Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for endonucleolytic involvement in 3′-directed excision was provided by the experiment shown in Figure 3A, which used an oligonucleotide probe complementary to that portion of the nicked heteroduplex strand spanning the mismatch. As can be seen, endonucleolytic products containing the mismatched base appeared and disappeared when ExoI was included in the reaction, as expected for a reaction intermediate (compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 7–10). Results of this kinetic analysis were also consistent with the above suggestion that hydrolytic removal of the mismatch inactivates the endonuclease system in cis to prevent incision events from occurring at sites distal from the mispair. As can be seen in Figure 3B, incision in the vicinity of the ClaI site was also suppressed when the endonucleolytic system was supplemented with ExoI. Whereas MutSα, ExoI, and RPA are sufficient for excision of a mismatch when the nick that directs hydrolysis is located 5′ to the mispair (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P.

Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Figure 3C demonstrates that the activity requirements for 3′-directed excision can be resolved in a two-stage reaction. Mismatch removal from the 3′ heteroduplex occurred in a stage 2 incubation lacking MutLα and PCNA provided that the heteroduplex was previously incubated with MutSα, MutLα, RFC, PCNA, and RPA, components sufficient for endonucleolytic incision of the DNA (lanes 1–5). Because MutSα, RPA, and a mismatch are sufficient to activate 5′-to-3′ hydrolysis by ExoI (Genschel and Modrich, 2003Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we attribute 3′-directed excision in this system to the 5′-to-3′ hydrolytic function of ExoI initiating at a strand break introduced on the 5′ side of the mispair by the action of MutSα, MutLα, RFC, and PCNA. Mismatch-dependent production of endonucleolytic intermediates can also be detected in nuclear extracts of human cells. In order to reduce heteroduplex ligation in extracts, these experiments employed a circular A-C heteroduplex (or A•T homoduplex) containing a 150 nucleotide gap located 51 bp 3′ to the mismatch (Figure 3D). The gapped heteroduplex supported mismatch-dependent endonuclease in the presence of MutSα, MutLα, RFC, and PCNA (Figure 3D, compare lanes 2 and 9). DNA fragments spanning the mismatch were also produced in HeLa nuclear extracts, and production of this species was also mismatch dependent (lanes 7 and 14). By contrast, fragments spanning the mispair were not produced in extracts derived from MLH1−/− H6 tumor cells, although supplementation of H6 extract with near homogeneous MutLα led to production of this species in a manner similar to that observed in HeLa extracts (lanes 5–7). As in the purified system, DNA fragments produced in nuclear extracts were derived from the discontinuous heteroduplex strand (Figure S3A). However, heteroduplex incision in nuclear extracts was more restricted to the vicinity of the mismatch than endonucleolytic events occurring in the purified system were (Figure S3B, lane 2 versus lanes 6 and 7). A similar effect has been noted previously with respect to termini produced in the MutSα-, MutLα-, ExoI-, RFC-, PCNA-, and RPA-dependent 3′-directed excision system (Dzantiev et al., 2004Dzantiev L.

Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These purified systems thus lack one or more activities that function to restrict action of the endonuclease component to the vicinity of the mispair. Two completely independent sets of near homogeneous proteins were used in this work, and individual preparations were free of detectable nonspecific endonuclease activity in presence of ATP and Mg2+ at the salt concentration used for mismatch repair assay (125 mM KCl) (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure S2). However, MutSα, MutLα, RFC, or PCNA must harbor the active site of the endonuclease observed in this system. Studies in our and other laboratories have failed to reveal such an activity associated with PCNA or RFC, and we have been unable to detect endonuclease activity in MutSα preparations. However, we have found that MutLα preparations display endonuclease activity under certain conditions. A weak endonuclease activity that incises closed circular supercoiled homoduplex DNA was detectable at low KCl concentration (23 mM) in the presence of 1 mM Mn2+ but was not detectable in the presence of Mg2+ (Figures 4A and 4B). The Mn2+-dependent activity was stimulated by 0.5 mM ATP (Figure 4A, compare lanes 2 and 3), consistent with the known involvement of MutLα ATP hydrolytic centers in mismatch repair (Tomer et al., 2002Tomer G.

We have used chromosome conformation capture to demonstrate the specific association of an enhancer element, H, on chromosome 14 with multiple OR gene promoters on different chromosomes. DNA and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments allow us to visualize the colocalization of the H enhancer with the single OR allele that is transcribed in a sensory neuron. In transgenic mice bearing additional H elements, sensory neurons that express OR pseudogenes also express a second functional receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2034133901,"How the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery accurately identifies terminally misfolded proteins is poorly understood. For luminal ERAD substrates, this recognition depends on their folding and glycosylation status as well as on the conserved ER lectin Yos9p. Here we show that Yos9p is part of a stable complex that organizes key components of ERAD machinery on both sides of the ER membrane, including the transmembrane ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p. We further demonstrate that Yos9p, together with Kar2p and Hrd3p, forms a luminal surveillance complex that both recruits nonnative proteins to the core ERAD machinery and assists a distinct sugar-dependent step necessary to commit substrates for degradation. When Hrd1p is uncoupled from the Yos9p surveillance complex, degradation can occur independently of the requirement for glycosylation. Thus, Yos9p/Kar2p/Hrd3p acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring correct identification of terminally misfolded proteins by recruiting misfolded forms to the ERAD machinery, contributing to the interrogation of substrate sugar status, and preventing glycosylation-independent degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2075152713,"Crossovers produced by homologous recombination promote accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis and are controlled such that at least one forms per chromosome pair and multiple crossovers are widely spaced. Recombination initiates with an excess number of double-strand breaks made by Spo11 protein. Thus, crossover control involves a decision by which some breaks give crossovers while others follow a predominantly noncrossover pathway(s). To understand this decision, we examined recombination when breaks are reduced in yeast spo11 hypomorphs. We find that crossover levels tend to be maintained at the expense of noncrossovers and that genomic loci differ in expression of this “crossover homeostasis.” These findings define a previously unsuspected manifestation of crossover control, i.e., that the crossover/noncrossover ratio can change to maintain crossovers.

Our results distinguish between existing models of crossover control and support the hypothesis that an obligate crossover is a genetically programmed event tied to crossover interference. Crossing over during meiosis helps to establish physical connections (chiasmata) between homologs that promote accurate segregation at the first meiotic division (Page and Hawley, 2003Page S.L. Hawley R.S. Chromosome choreography: the meiotic ballet.Science. 2003; 301: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Chromosomes that fail to cross over also frequently fail to disjoin properly, yielding aneuploid gametes. Not surprisingly then, crossover formation is tightly controlled to prevent the occurrence of nonexchange chromosomes (Bishop and Zickler, 2004Bishop D.K. Zickler D. Early decision; meiotic crossover interference prior to stable strand exchange and synapsis.Cell. 2004; 117: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Hillers, 2004Hillers K.J.

Crossover control has several manifestations in most organisms. First, the distribution of crossovers among chromosomes is not random. Rather, the average number of crossovers per chromosome pair is extremely low (often as low as 1–2), yet nonexchange chromosomes are rare. The tendency toward guaranteed crossover formation is often referred to as the obligate crossover or chiasma (Jones, 1984Jones G.H. The control of chiasma distribution.Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1984; 38: 293-320PubMed Google Scholar). A second manifestation of crossover control is that crossovers are distributed nonrandomly along chromosomes when two or more occur on the same chromosome pair: a crossover in one region makes it less likely that another will be found nearby. This phenomenon, first described nearly a century ago (Muller, 1916Muller H.J. The mechanism of crossing over.Am. Nat. 1916; 50: 193-221Crossref Google Scholar, Sturtevant, 1915Sturtevant A.H. The behavior of chromosomes as studied through linkage.Z. Abstam. Vererbung. 1915; 13: 234-287Google Scholar), is called crossover interference (reviewed in Hillers, 2004Hillers K.J. Crossover interference.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1036-R1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Kleckner et al., 2004Kleckner N. Zickler D. Jones G.H. Dekker J. Padmore R. Henle J. Hutchinson J. A mechanical basis for chromosome function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The strength of interference diminishes as a function of distance along the chromosome, but the distances involved vary substantially from organism to organism, from tens of kb in S. cerevisiae (Malkova et al., 2004Malkova A. Swanson J. German M. McCusker J.H. Housworth E.A. Stahl F.W. Haber J.E. Gene conversion and crossing over along the 405-kb left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.Genetics. 2004; 168: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to tens of Mb or greater in mammals (e.g., Broman and Weber, 2000Broman K.W. Weber J.L. Characterization of human crossover interference.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 1911-1926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The net result of crossover control is that each chromosome gets at least one crossover despite a low average number of crossovers per chromosome, and multiple crossovers on the same chromosome tend to be evenly and widely spaced. It is generally thought that these aspects of crossover control reflect a single underlying mechanism, although this remains to be formally proven (Hillers, 2004Hillers K.J. Crossover interference.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1036-R1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Kleckner et al., 2004Kleckner N. Zickler D. Jones G.H. Dekker J. Padmore R. Henle J. Hutchinson J. A mechanical basis for chromosome function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Crossovers are generated by homologous recombination initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed by the topoisomerase-like Spo11 protein (Keeney, 2001Keeney S. Mechanism and control of meiotic recombination initiation.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 52: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are more DSBs than crossovers, in some cases substantially more (≥10-fold) (e.g., Moens et al., 2002Moens P.B. Kolas N.K. Tarsounas M. Marcon E. Cohen P.E. Spyropoulos B. The time course and chromosomal localization of recombination-related proteins at meiosis in the mouse are compatible with models that can resolve the early DNA-DNA interactions without reciprocal recombination.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1611-1622PubMed Google Scholar). DSBs that do not become crossovers are repaired to give noncrossovers instead. DSBs interfere with formation of adjacent DSBs much less (if at all) than crossovers interfere with one another (e.g., Malkova et al., 2004Malkova A. Swanson J. German M. McCusker J.H. Housworth E.A. Stahl F.W. Haber J.E. Gene conversion and crossing over along the 405-kb left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.Genetics. 2004; 168: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, integral to crossover interference is a “decision” process by which a subset of randomly distributed recombination precursors (DSBs or later stage intermediates) enters a pathway that culminates in crossover formation, while all other precursors follow a pathway(s) that generates primarily noncrossover products (most likely with a few noninterfering crossovers) (Allers and Lichten, 2001Allers T.

Copenhaver G.P. Does crossover interference count in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?.Genetics. 2004; 168: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This decision occurs early, at or prior to the appearance of the first stable strand exchange intermediates (reviewed in Bishop and Zickler, 2004Bishop D.K. Zickler D. Early decision; meiotic crossover interference prior to stable strand exchange and synapsis.Cell. 2004; 117: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). How one precursor over another is chosen for a crossover fate is not well understood. One possibility is that a subset of precursors is selected from the available pool and directed toward a crossover fate, with excess precursors—no matter how many or how few—resolved by a default, predominantly noncrossover pathway. This model would fit well with the obligate crossover as a programmed event that is mechanistically linked to interference. This scenario is also consistent with models in which crossover designation at a given site results in propagation of a physical signal that inhibits crossover formation nearby (see Discussion). This model makes a clear prediction about what would happen if fewer DSBs were made, namely that crossover numbers should tend to be maintained at the expense of noncrossovers. We tested this prediction in S. cerevisiae using a spo11 allelic series to vary Spo11 activity in vivo (Henderson and Keeney, 2004Henderson K.A. Keeney S. Tying synaptonemal complex initiation to the formation and programmed repair of DNA double-strand breaks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4519-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We show here that crossovers indeed tend to be maintained at the expense of noncrossovers, such that the crossover/noncrossover ratio changes. These findings give insight into the fundamental logic of the interference decision and distinguish between existing mechanistic models of crossover control. To reduce DSBs throughout the genome, we used a previously described series of spo11 mutants (Diaz et al., 2002Diaz R.L. Alcid A.D. Berger J.M. Keeney S. Identification of residues in yeast Spo11p critical for meiotic DNA double-strand break formation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1106-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Henderson and Keeney, 2004Henderson K.A. Keeney S. Tying synaptonemal complex initiation to the formation and programmed repair of DNA double-strand breaks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4519-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The first expresses Spo11 tagged at its C terminus with three repeats of the HA epitope and a hexahistidine sequence (spo11-HA3His6, hereafter spo11-HA for simplicity). The tag reduces DSB frequency for unknown reasons. DSBs are further reduced in strains heterozygous for spo11-HA and a tagged allele with the catalytic tyrosine altered to phenylalanine (spo11-Y135F-HA3His6, hereafter spo11yf-HA). DSBs are reduced even further in strains homozygous for mutation of another putative active site residue (spo11-D290A-HA3His6, hereafter spo11da-HA). Spo11 activity was quantified by direct measurement of DSBs in genomic DNA and by frequencies of intragenic recombination at the HIS4LEU2 and ARG4 loci in return-to-growth assays (Figure 1A and Table 1). Based on the direct DSB measurements, the mutants formed ∼80%, ∼30%, and ∼20% of wild-type DSB levels. There was broad agreement between different genomic regions, indicating that this allelic series titrates Spo11 activity in a fairly uniform manner across the genome (although there are some variations, discussed further below).Table 1Reduced DSB Formation in a Series of spo11 Hypomorphic MutantsResult for Each SPO11 Genotype (% of Wild-Type Value)Analytical MethodWild-Typespo11-HAspo11-HAspo11yf-HAspo11-HAspo11da-HAspo11da-HAA. rad50S DSBs on Pulsed-Field Gels, 32°C (% of DNA) Chromosome III50.7 ± 2.3 (100)34.9 ± 1.1 (69)14.8 ± 2.7 (29)9.4 ± 2.7 (19) Chromosome VII60.9 ± 2.2 (100)45.6 ± 4.4 (75)19.2 ± 4.1 (32)11.4 ± 2.6 (19) Chromosome VIII54.9 ± 2.6 (100)49.0 ± 2.0 (89)13.6 ± 3.6 (25)6.9 ± 3.9 (13)Relative Activity (% of wild type)∗≡ 10078 ± 1029 ± 417 ± 4B.

To examine the relationship between crossover and DSB frequencies, we constructed strains that differed in the SPO11 genotype and carried heterozygous markers to measure crossover frequencies in eight intervals spanning a total of 484 kb on three chromosomes (Figure 1B). These chromosomes span a range of sizes from the third smallest of the yeast genome to the third largest. Crossover formation and interference have been extensively studied in these regions (e.g., de los Santos et al., 2003de los Santos T. Hunter N. Lee C. Larkin B. Loidl J. Hollingsworth N.M. The Mus81/Mms4 endonuclease acts independently of double-Holliday junction resolution to promote a distinct subset of crossovers during meiosis in budding yeast.Genetics. 2003; 164: 81-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Malkova et al., 2004Malkova A. Swanson J. German M. McCusker J.H. Housworth E.A. Stahl F.W. Haber J.E. Gene conversion and crossing over along the 405-kb left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.Genetics. 2004; 168: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Segregation of the markers was analyzed in ≥750 four-spore-viable tetrads for each SPO11 genotype, providing a measure of genetic distances between markers expressed in centimorgans (cM), where 1 cM corresponds to a crossover frequency of 1%. Figure 1C summarizes genetic distances in the four SPO11 genotypes; full segregation patterns and statistical tests are in Tables S1 and S2. In four of five intervals on the larger chromosomes (VII and VIII), there was no statistically significant decrease in crossover frequency in the mutants compared to wild-type or one another. In the fifth interval (CEN8::URA3 to thr1) and in all three intervals on chromosome III, crossovers were significantly reduced for at least one of the mutants (p < 0.017, G test) but always less than the reduction in DSBs. For example, crossovers were reduced ∼2-fold in the his4 to leu2 interval in spo11da-HA versus wild-type, as compared to the ∼5-fold reduction in DSBs. Surprisingly, the cyh2-trp5 and thr1-cup1 intervals had small but significant increases in crossover frequencies in some of the spo11 mutants. This pattern may reflect the fact that tetrad dissection for wild-type was carried out in a separate laboratory. Similar small variations were reported in another recent study (Malkova et al., 2004Malkova A. Swanson J. German M. McCusker J.H. Housworth E.A. Stahl F.W. Haber J.E. Gene conversion and crossing over along the 405-kb left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.Genetics. 2004; 168: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This issue does not affect conclusions drawn here because the overall pattern holds even if the three spo11 mutants are considered separately. Chromosome segregation defects were seen only in the more defective spo11 mutants, as revealed by spore viability patterns (Table S3). Wild-type yielded 95.2% viable spores, with 917 four-spore-viable tetrads out of 1049 dissected (87%). The spo11-HA strain yielded similar numbers (94.0% viable spores, 87% four-spore-viable tetrads), indicating that the ∼20% reduction in DSBs in this strain had little or no effect on the efficiency of meiotic chromosome segregation. In contrast, spore viabilities were reduced in spo11yf-HA/spo11-HA (75.9% viable spores, 62% four-spore-viable tetrads) and spo11da-HA strains (69.7% viable spores, 56% four-spore-viable tetrads). Both strains had increased frequencies of two-spore- and zero-spore-viable tetrads, a hallmark of homolog nondisjunction at the first division (Table S3). Thus, there appears to be a threshold between ∼80% and ∼30% of normal DSBs below which there is insufficient recombination to support the normal efficiency of chromosome segregation. Our analysis reveals a nonlinear quantitative relationship between DSBs and crossovers (Figure 1D), from which we infer that crossover numbers tend to be maintained despite reduction in the number of initiation events. We refer to this phenomenon as crossover homeostasis. Importantly, this relationship was observed even in the spo11-HA strain, which had normal spore viability. Thus, quantitative differences between crossovers and DSBs cannot be ascribed solely to selection bias imposed by analysis of four-spore-viable tetrads (see Discussion). Since crossover numbers remained high when DSBs were reduced, it follows that a smaller proportion of DSBs were being repaired as noncrossovers, i.e., that the ratio of crossovers to noncrossovers was altered. We were unable to assess this conclusion directly from the tetrad data because there were not enough gene conversion tetrads to provide a statistically significant measure of relative crossover and noncrossover frequencies (Table S4 and data not shown). A recombination reporter was therefore designed to measure the frequencies of both crossover and noncrossover events at a single locus. ARG4 is a natural meiotic recombination hotspot within one of the intervals on chromosome VIII analyzed above (Figure 2A) (Nicolas et al., 1989Nicolas A. Treco D. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. An initiation site for meiotic gene conversion in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nature. 1989; 338: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Meiotic DSBs form frequently at a site ∼185 bp upstream of the ARG4 coding region (Figure 2B). We used two arg4 alleles: arg4-Nsp mutated at an NspHI restriction site at the initiation codon and arg4-Bgl mutated at a BglII site near the 3′ end of the gene (Figure 2B) (Nicolas et al., 1989Nicolas A. Treco D. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. An initiation site for meiotic gene conversion in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nature. 1989; 338: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These alleles were flanked by two markers used in the tetrad analysis above: the URA3 gene integrated near the centromere and a mutation at THR1. NdeI restriction site polymorphisms were also introduced closer to ARG4. A diploid heterozygous for these arg4 mutations cannot grow on medium lacking arginine, but a functional ARG4 gene can be generated by recombination. Nearly all Arg+ progeny arise from gene conversion, with or without associated crossover. The effects of the spo11 mutations on conversion frequencies at ARG4 were first determined. As expected, the spo11 mutants yielded fewer Arg+ recombinants than wild-type (Table 1). The results were similar to the effect of these mutations elsewhere in the genome, except for spo11da-HA, which had a more severe effect on frequencies of conversions and DSBs at ARG4 than at most other genomic regions (Table 1 and data not shown). To measure what fraction of Arg+ recombinants had exchanged the flanking markers, random spores were plated on medium lacking arginine, then Arg+ spore clones were scored for the configuration of flanking markers by replica-plating on medium lacking uracil or threonine (Figure 2C). In the SPO11+ strain, 54.8% of Arg+ recombinants had a nonparental configuration of the flanking markers, and this fraction increased progressively in the three spo11 mutants (Table 2). This was the expected pattern for crossover homeostasis: if a greater fraction of recombination events are crossover associated in the spo11 mutants, then a greater fraction of Arg+ recombinants should have nonparental flanking markers. However, when the flanking markers have been exchanged, the exchange could have arisen from the same recombination event that gave the Arg+ conversion or could have arisen from an independent event elsewhere in the interval. The latter is referred to as an incidental exchange and could complicate interpretation of the results if it occurred frequently. We therefore analyzed the configuration of the NdeI restriction site polymorphisms closely flanking ARG4 (Figure 2B). A crossover associated with the Arg+ conversion would exchange the NdeI polymorphisms along with the more distant markers, whereas incidental exchange outside the region between the NdeI sites would leave a parental NdeI configuration (see Figure S1 for more detail).Table 2Random Spore Analysis of Recombination at the ARG4 LocusParentalNonparentalGenotypeUra+ Thr+Ura− Thr−Ura− Thr+Ura+ Thr−Total% NonparentalSignificanceWild-type134 (4.2)1322 (41.1)1525 (47.4)239 (7.4)322054.8HA/HA159 (4.8)1186 (36.0)1754 (53.3)194 (5.9)329359.2p = 0.0004yf-HA/HA149 (4.1)1120 (30.6)2207 (60.4)180 (4.9)365665.3p = 1 × 10−7da-HA/da-HA130 (5.5)633 (26.8)1534 (64.8)69 (2.9)236667.8p = 3 × 10−7Random spores from strains carrying the recombination reporter diagrammed in Figure 2 and the indicated SPO11 genotypes were plated on medium lacking arginine to select for Arg+ recombinants, then the configuration of flanking markers was scored. Data were pooled from three independent cultures of each strain (≥661 spore clones per culture). Statistical significance was evaluated by G test for the distribution of spore types for each strain compared to the strain listed above it. The majority (∼90%) of the recombinants with a parental configuration of flanking markers were Ura− and Thr−. This is the expected pattern because of the polarity of gene conversion at this locus (Nicolas et al., 1989Nicolas A. Treco D. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. An initiation site for meiotic gene conversion in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nature. 1989; 338: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Specifically, in recombination initiated by a DSB, the broken chromosome is the recipient of genetic information. The arg4-Nsp mutation is closer to the DSB site (Figure 2B), so conversion of this mutation to wild-type accounts for most of the noncrossover Arg+ recombinants. Thus, Arg+ progeny arising from a noncrossover event will inherit the parental configuration from the original arg4-Nsp chromosome. The same feature of the locus accounts for the fact that the majority (∼90%) of the Arg+ spores with a nonparental configuration were Ura− Thr+.

This is the expected pattern because of the polarity of gene conversion at this locus (Nicolas et al., 1989Nicolas A. Treco D. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. An initiation site for meiotic gene conversion in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nature. 1989; 338: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Specifically, in recombination initiated by a DSB, the broken chromosome is the recipient of genetic information. The arg4-Nsp mutation is closer to the DSB site (Figure 2B), so conversion of this mutation to wild-type accounts for most of the noncrossover Arg+ recombinants. Thus, Arg+ progeny arising from a noncrossover event will inherit the parental configuration from the original arg4-Nsp chromosome. The same feature of the locus accounts for the fact that the majority (∼90%) of the Arg+ spores with a nonparental configuration were Ura− Thr+. For the SPO11+ strain, 77 clones of the majority nonparental class (Ura− Thr+) were scored. Of these, 70 (91%) also had a nonparental NdeI configuration, consistent with a single crossover associated with conversion at ARG4 (Table S5). In the spo11yf-HA/spo11-HA mutant, 86 of 89 Ura− Thr+ clones analyzed (97%) also had a nonparental configuration of NdeI sites, not significantly different from wild-type (p > 0.15) (Table S5). Of the remaining Ura− Thr+ clones from both strains, nearly all had a marker configuration consistent with a noncrossover conversion of arg4-Nsp plus a single incidental exchange (Table S5 and Figure S1). Incidental exchanges played a more significant role in generating the minority (Ura+ Thr−) class of nonparental Arg+ recombinants because only ∼70% had the expected pattern for a single exchange associated with the Arg+ conversion for both SPO11 (6 of 9 clones analyzed) and spo11yf-HA/spo11-HA (5 of 7 clones) (Table S5 and Figure S1). These findings indicate that incidental exchanges accounted for only ∼12% of nonparental Arg+ clones. More importantly, this fraction varied little with SPO11 genotype, ruling out the possibility that the differences we observed in the spo11 mutants were caused by changes in the contribution of incidental exchanges. The fraction of Arg+ conversions that are crossover associated can be estimated by correcting for the observed frequency of incidental exchanges (i.e., scoring 10% of the Ura− Thr+ clones and 30% of Ura+ Thr− clones as noncrossover even though they had an exchange). (Incidental exchanges could also “erase” crossovers that were associated with Arg+ conversion, but such events are very infrequent because they require ≥2 crossovers in the small interval between CEN8::URA3 and THR1.) From this estimate, 47.8% (1539/3220) of Arg+ conversions were crossover associated in wild-type, and this fraction increased to 52.1% (1715/3293) in spo11-HA/spo11-HA, to 58.8% (2112/3656) in spo11yf-HA/spo11-HA, and to 60.4% (1429/2366) in spo11da-HA/spo11da/HA. These increases were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.0004, Fisher's exact test mid-p). Thus, decreased DSB frequencies cause an increase in the ratio of crossovers to noncrossovers (Figure 2D), confirming that crossover numbers tend to be maintained at the expense of noncrossovers. Interestingly, these results also reveal that crossover homeostasis does not provide an absolute guarantee that a DSB will give rise to a crossover. If crossover homeostasis were completely efficient, the crossover-noncrossover ratio should increase rapidly with decreasing DSB frequency, reaching a situation in which every recombination event yields a crossover. The observed crossover-noncrossover ratios diverge substantially from this expectation for the more severely DSB-defective strains (Figure 2D). Possible reasons for this behavior are addressed in the Discussion. To determine whether reduced DSBs affected crossover interference, we examined the tetrad data for the SPO11 allelic series using the method described by Malkova et al., 2004Malkova A. Swanson J. German M. McCusker J.H. Housworth E.A. Stahl F.W. Haber J.E. Gene conversion and crossing over along the 405-kb left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.Genetics. 2004; 168: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar (Table S6). Briefly, the tetrads were divided into two groups based on presence (tetratypes and nonparental ditypes) or absence (parental ditypes) of a detectable crossover within a reference interval. Then, for each group we assessed crossover frequency in an adjacent interval. If a crossover in the reference interval is accompanied by significantly less recombination in an adjacent interval, then we can conclude that crossover interference extends from one interval to the other. The process was repeated for each SPO11 genotype, using each of the eight intervals individually as the reference (Table S6). For example, when there was no detectable crossover in the lys5-met13 interval, the adjacent met13-cyh2 interval had a genetic length of 13.6 cM, but when there was a crossover in the lys5-met13 interval, the met13-cyh2 distance was only 4.3 cM (Table S6B). As a rough estimate of the strength of interference, we determined the ratio of the two genetic distances (i.e., 4.3/13.6 = 0.32) (Figure 3 and Table S6). The smaller the ratio, the greater the apparent strength of interference. This “interference ratio” is different from but analogous to another measure of interference, the coefficient of coincidence. In wild-type, interference was observed between several adjacent intervals (interference ratios of 0.3–0.5): between his4-leu2 and leu2-CEN3 on chromosome III, between lys5-met13 and met13-cyh2 on chromosome VII, and between CEN8-thr1 and thr1-cup1 on chromosome VIII (Figure 3 and Table S6). The patterns on chromosome VII were co"

A new study uses atomically precise substitution of individual dopants to measure their interactions on the nanometre scale. The discovery of ferromagnetism in manganese-doped gallium arsenide sparked interest in semiconductors based on electron spin, or spintronics. This study uses scanning tunnelling microscopy to visualize the GaAs electronic states involved in Mn–Mn interactions. A strong dependence of ferromagnetic interaction on crystal orientation is seen, a property that might be exploited by growing oriented structures with ferromagnetic transition temperatures beyond those of randomly doped samples. This could also lead to coupled quantum bits for memory or information processing. Cover graphic: Mn hole states visualized on a GaAs surface mediate magnetic interactions between spin states. The discovery of ferromagnetism in Mn-doped GaAs1 has ignited interest in the development of semiconductor technologies based on electron spin and has led to several proof-of-concept spintronic devices2,3,4. A major hurdle for realistic applications of Ga1-xMnxAs, or other dilute magnetic semiconductors, remains that their ferromagnetic transition temperature is below room temperature. Enhancing ferromagnetism in semiconductors requires us to understand the mechanisms for interaction between magnetic dopants, such as Mn, and identify the circumstances in which ferromagnetic interactions are maximized5. Here we describe an atom-by-atom substitution technique using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and apply it to perform a controlled study at the atomic scale of the interactions between isolated Mn acceptors, which are mediated by holes in GaAs. High-resolution STM measurements are used to visualize the GaAs electronic states that participate in the Mn–Mn interaction and to quantify the interaction strengths as a function of relative position and orientation. Our experimental findings, which can be explained using tight-binding model calculations, reveal a strong dependence of ferromagnetic interaction on crystallographic orientation. This anisotropic interaction can potentially be exploited by growing oriented Ga1-xMnxAs structures to enhance the ferromagnetic transition temperature beyond that achieved in randomly doped samples."
https://openalex.org/W2150121030,"The PML tumor suppressor controls key pathways for growth suppression, induction of apoptosis, and cellular senescence. PML loss occurs frequently in human tumors through unknown posttranslational mechanisms. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is oncogenic and frequently upregulated in human tumors. Here we show that CK2 regulates PML protein levels by promoting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation dependent on direct phosphorylation at Ser517. Consequently, PML mutants that are resistant to CK2 phosphorylation display increased tumor-suppressive functions. In a faithful mouse model of lung cancer, we demonstrate that Pml inactivation leads to increased tumorigenesis. Furthermore, CK2 pharmacological inhibition enhances the PML tumor-suppressive property in vivo. Importantly, we found an inverse correlation between CK2 kinase activity and PML protein levels in human lung cancer-derived cell lines and primary specimens. These data identify a key posttranslational mechanism that controls PML protein levels and provide therapeutic means toward PML restoration through CK2 inhibition."

We report volcanism on the 135 million-year-old Pacific Plate not belonging to any of these categories. Small alkalic volcanoes form from small percent melts and originate in the asthenosphere, as implied by their trace element geochemistry and noble gas isotopic compositions. We propose that these small volcanoes erupt along lithospheric fractures in response to plate flexure during subduction. Minor extents of asthenospheric melting and the volcanoes' tectonic alignment and age progression in the direction opposite to that of plate motion provide evidence for the presence of a small percent melt in the asthenosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2012632535,"Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are important in global biogeochemical cycles, providing biological oases at the sea floor that are supported by the thermal and chemical flux from the Earth's interior. As hot, acidic and reduced hydrothermal fluids mix with cold, alkaline and oxygenated sea water, minerals precipitate to form porous sulphide-sulphate deposits. These structures provide microhabitats for a diversity of prokaryotes that exploit the geochemical and physical gradients in this dynamic ecosystem. It has been proposed that fluid pH in the actively venting sulphide structures is generally low (pH < 4.5), yet no extreme thermoacidophile has been isolated from vent deposits. Culture-independent surveys based on ribosomal RNA genes from deep-sea hydrothermal deposits have identified a widespread euryarchaeotal lineage, DHVE2 (deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeotic 2). Despite the ubiquity and apparent deep-sea endemism of DHVE2, cultivation of this group has been unsuccessful and thus its metabolism remains a mystery. Here we report the isolation and cultivation of a member of the DHVE2 group, which is an obligate thermoacidophilic sulphur- or iron-reducing heterotroph capable of growing from pH 3.3 to 5.8 and between 55 and 75 degrees C. In addition, we demonstrate that this isolate constitutes up to 15% of the archaeal population, providing evidence that thermoacidophiles may be key players in the sulphur and iron cycling at deep-sea vents."

This Essay will examine the opportunities for harnessing RNA interference (RNAi) for therapy, as well as the obstacles and possible ways to circumvent them. Knocking down expression of disease-related genes using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has potential for treating a variety of illnesses. This Essay will examine the opportunities for harnessing RNA interference (RNAi) for therapy, as well as the obstacles and possible ways to circumvent them. Five years ago, Tuschl and colleagues showed that RNA interference (RNAi) works in mammalian cells. They found that the endogenous RNAi pathway can be harnessed by introducing small double-stranded RNAs comprising 19–21 nucleotide complementary sequences (called small interfering RNAs, siRNAs) into mammalian cells to silence gene expression with exquisite specificity and without activating an interferon response (Elbashir et al., 2001Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar). Translational researchers were quick to realize the potential for using RNAi to identify new drug targets and for designing small molecule drugs. siRNA-based drug development has proceeded at a dizzying pace. The first demonstration of disease protection using siRNAs in a mouse model was published three years ago (Song et al., 2003bSong E. Lee S.K. Wang J. Ince N. Ouyang N. Min J. Chen J. Shankar P. Lieberman J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), and human safety clinical studies began a little over a year later, well before much of the basic phenomena of RNAi were really understood. Some believe, and we agree, that siRNAs have the potential to become the next new class of drugs. Three phase I clinical studies investigating siRNAs for treating age-related macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have been completed with no reports of untoward toxicity. The ability to design siRNAs to any host gene or pathogen once genetic sequences are known and test them rapidly highlights a key advantage of siRNA drug development compared to more conventional small molecule drugs. For example, the human phase I study of siRNAs targeting RSV by Alnylam began just 15 months after the company starting working on this project (A. de Fougerolles, personal communication). In the original RNAi studies, gene expression was silenced by transducing cultured mammalian cell lines with siRNAs or with viral vectors encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) processed within cells like endogenous microRNAs. These two approaches—siRNA small molecule drugs or shRNA gene therapy—are the two pathways available for harnessing RNAi in both research and the development of therapeutics. The gene therapy application of RNAi is likely to remain mostly an academic exercise for the immediate future. Early clinical studies have focused on using siRNAs as small molecule drugs. However, as we discuss in this Essay, there are many hurdles to be overcome before siRNA drugs become a reality. To be useful as drugs, siRNAs need to be delivered in vivo into the cytoplasm of cells. Here, the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) take up the double-stranded siRNAs and cleave the sense passenger strand, leaving the activated RISC containing the antisense strand to search for mRNAs containing complementary sequences, which will then be targeted for degradation (Figure 1). Although siRNAs are readily taken up by invertebrate cells, siRNAs on their own are not taken up by most mammalian cells in a way that preserves their activity. Even cells that are actively sampling their environment, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, do not take up siRNAs efficiently enough to activate gene silencing. Although lipid-based transfection can introduce siRNAs into a variety of cells in vitro, many important cells, such as primary lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem cells, are refractory to transfection (although nucleofection, a proprietary electroporation method developed by Amaxa, does work for these cells). Moreover, these methods of intracellular delivery are not suitable for in vivo use. Therefore, siRNA intracellular delivery has been the most formidable obstacle to siRNA drug development. Practical solutions to the delivery problem are, however, becoming available. Some tissues of the body that are easily accessible, including the respiratory and genital tracts and the eye, can take up siRNAs after topical application or direct injection of naked siRNAs alone or in complexes with cationic lipids used for in vitro transfection (Bitko et al., 2005Bitko V. Musiyenko A. Shulyayeva O. Barik S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, Palliser et al., 2006Palliser D. Chowdhury D. Wang Q.Y. Lee S.J. Bronson R.T. Knipe D.M. Lieberman J. Nature. 2006; 439: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Phase I clinical studies to treat age-related macular degeneration of the retina and RSV in the respiratory tract have demonstrated uptake in those target tissues after intravitreal injection and intranasal application of naked siRNAs, respectively. Cells in the epithelium and lamina propria of the mouse vagina and cervix very efficiently take up siRNA-lipid complexes. It may well be that most cells at the mucosal surfaces of the body efficiently internalize siRNAs, suggesting that topical siRNA therapies have the fewest hurdles to overcome. Given that mucosal surfaces are the portals of entry for most pathogens, the use of topically applied siRNAs to prevent or treat intracellular infection is an attractive option, especially for viral infections for which few drugs exist. For example, local siRNA delivery to the lung was able to protect nonhuman primates from infection with the SARS coronavirus (Li et al., 2005Li B.J. Tang Q. Cheng D. Qin C. Xie F.Y. Wei Q. Xu J. Liu Y. Zheng B.J. Woodle M.C. et al.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 944-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Other opportunities for local treatment include localized inflammatory diseases such as seasonal rhinitis or mucosal malignancies such as cancers of the head and neck, nasopharynx, or cervix (some of which are caused by transforming viruses, providing specific gene targets). Targeting inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, is also high on the agenda of at least one RNAi biotechnology company. This will require aerosolized delivery to introduce siRNAs into the appropriate epithelial and immune cells deep within the lung. However, it is still not clear which primary cell types in accessible tissues efficiently take up naked siRNAs or siRNA-lipid complexes and would be amenable to local siRNA therapeutic delivery. Moreover, the mechanism of uptake into mammalian cells is not understood. Answering these questions will be important for choosing the best disease targets for RNAi therapeutics. The earliest studies showing siRNA effectiveness systemically in animal disease models relied on hydrodynamic injection. With this technique, siRNAs are injected rapidly in a large bolus that causes transient damage to cell membranes in highly vascularized organs enabling siRNAs to access the cytoplasm (McCaffrey et al., 2002McCaffrey A.P. Meuse L. Pham T.T. Conklin D.S. Hannon G.J. Kay M.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 38-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, Song et al., 2003bSong E. Lee S.K. Wang J. Ince N. Ouyang N. Min J. Chen J. Shankar P. Lieberman J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). This method of injection is dangerous and not feasible for human use. However, by catheterizing the vein draining an organ, it is possible to raise vascular pressure locally to introduce siRNAs that are therapeutically beneficial (Hamar et al., 2004Hamar P. Song E. Kokeny G. Chen A. Ouyang N. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 14883-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These early studies suggested that naked siRNAs would not be internalized after conventional intravenous injection into most tissues. However, a sensitive detailed tissue survey has never been reported, raising the possibility that some cell types or tissues might actually be amenable to systemic targeting. To target most tissues deep within the body, clinically feasible noninvasive strategies need to be devised for directing siRNAs into cells. In the past year, several approaches have achieved impressive therapeutic benefit following intravenous injection into mice and primates using reasonable doses of siRNAs without apparent limiting toxicities (Figure 2). One approach involves covalently coupling the passenger strand of the siRNA to cholesterol to facilitate uptake through ubiquitously expressed cell-surface LDL receptors (Soutschek et al., 2004Soutschek J. Akinc A. Bramlage B. Charisse K. Constien R. Donoghue M. Elbashir S. Geick A. Hadwiger P. Harborth J. et al.Nature. 2004; 432: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). This approach targeted siRNAs to the liver and jejunum. In fact, because of its rich vascular supply and role as the blood filtering and detoxifying organ, the liver is the internal organ that is probably easiest to target. Silencing the cholesterol transport protein ApoB with cholesterol-conjugated chemically stabilized ApoB siRNAs reduced serum cholesterol in mice by about 30%. However, this therapeutic effect required a high siRNA dose (∼50 mg/kg) that is unlikely to be applicable to humans. A similarly impressive decrease in serum cholesterol could be achieved by designing a cholesterol-conjugated stabilized siRNA, with an active strand that is complementary to an endogenous microRNA (miR-122) expressed primarily in the liver. Such an siRNA is designed to interfere with the ability of the microRNA to silence its targets (Krutzfeldt et al., 2005Krutzfeldt J. Rajewsky N. Braich R. Rajeev K.G. Tuschl T. Manoharan M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2005; 438: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar). Drugs based on siRNAs that mimic or antagonize endogenous microRNA function may be of value in treating cancer because microRNAs are important for regulating cellular differentiation, which goes awry during tumor formation (Croce and Calin, 2005Croce C.M. Calin G.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 6-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, Hammond, 2006Hammond S.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Conjugating siRNAs to other small molecules, either natural ligands for cell-surface receptors or small molecule drugs, would theoretically provide alternate ways to target specific subsets of cells bearing the specified receptor. Although all cells bear cholesterol receptors, steering siRNAs into specific cell types by chemically conjugating them to ligands for cell-type-specific receptors would be likely to reduce the necessary drug dose as well as limit toxicity to unintended bystander cells. Another strategy for delivering siRNAs to the liver involves encapsulating siRNAs into specialized liposomes formed using polyethylene glycol to reduce uptake by scavenger cells and enhance time spent in the circulation. These specialized nucleic acid particles (stable nucleic acid-lipid particles or SNALPs) delivered siRNAs effectively to the liver (and not to other organs), reducing the replication of hepatitis B replicons in mice (Morrissey et al., 2005Morrissey D.V. Lockridge J.A. Shaw L. Blanchard K. Jensen K. Breen W. Hartsough K. Machemer L. Radka S. Jadhav V. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) and ApoB expression in nonhuman primates (Zimmermann et al., 2006Zimmermann T.S. Lee A.C. Akinc A. Bramlage B. Bumcrot D. Fedoruk M.N. Harborth J. Heyes J.A. Jeffs L.B. John M. et al.Nature. 2006; 441: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Delivery by SNALPs, a strategy developed by Protiva, reduced the effective siRNA dose to ≤3 mg/kg/day, a practical therapeutic dose. Liposomes, or other lipoplex or nanoparticle siRNA formulations, can at least in principle be varied with respect to size, lipid composition, and incorporation of targeting molecules to direct siRNAs to other treatment sites. A cell-specific targeting strategy, effective at ∼1 mg/kg siRNA dose in a mouse tumor model, involves mixing siRNAs with a fusion protein composed of a targeting antibody fragment linked to protamine, the basic protein that nucleates DNA in sperm and binds siRNAs by charge (Song et al., 2005Song E. Zhu P. Lee S.K. Chowdhury D. Kussman S. Dykxhoorn D.M. Feng Y. Palliser D. Weiner D.B. Shankar P. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). These fusion proteins can deliver siRNAs with exquisite specificity to a wide variety of cells, including primary hematopoietic cells that are ordinarily difficult to transfect even in vitro. Such fusion proteins have delivered siRNAs to HIV-infected lymphocytes but not uninfected cells (Song et al., 2005Song E. Zhu P. Lee S.K. Chowdhury D. Kussman S. Dykxhoorn D.M. Feng Y. Palliser D. Weiner D.B. Shankar P. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and to activated leukocytes but not resting leukocytes (D. Peer, P. Zhu, M. Shimaoka, and J.L., unpublished data). Because the siRNA is not covalently bound, the same delivery agent can be used to deliver different siRNAs or cocktails of siRNAs. These examples of systemic siRNA delivery are only the beginning but suggest that the delivery hurdle is not insurmountable. Which approach works best will likely depend on the target cell and indication. Unmodified and uncomplexed siRNAs have a very short half-life in the blood (∼minutes) that limits their usefulness as drugs. They are rapidly eliminated by renal excretion, which is the rate-limiting factor, and also degraded somewhat more slowly (T1/2 ∼1 hr) by serum RNases. Information about the half-life of unmodified siRNAs in other bodily fluids, such as those bathing the mucosal portals of entry and the eye, is not available. Given their rapid elimination, the dramatic therapeutic effects of unmodified siRNAs in some animal disease models (Bitko et al., 2005Bitko V. Musiyenko A. Shulyayeva O. Barik S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, Palliser et al., 2006Palliser D. Chowdhury D. Wang Q.Y. Lee S.J. Bronson R.T. Knipe D.M. Lieberman J. Nature. 2006; 439: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, Song et al., 2003bSong E. Lee S.K. Wang J. Ince N. Ouyang N. Min J. Chen J. Shankar P. Lieberman J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) are indeed impressive and bode well for the effectiveness of modified siRNA drugs with improved pharmacokinetic properties. Once inside a cell, the active strand of the siRNA incorporated into the RISC appears to be incredibly stable as silencing in some tissues persists for weeks (Palliser et al., 2006Palliser D. Chowdhury D. Wang Q.Y. Lee S.J. Bronson R.T. Knipe D.M. Lieberman J. Nature. 2006; 439: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, Song et al., 2003bSong E. Lee S.K. Wang J. Ince N. Ouyang N. Min J. Chen J. Shankar P. Lieberman J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, Zimmermann et al., 2006Zimmermann T.S. Lee A.C. Akinc A. Bramlage B. Bumcrot D. Fedoruk M.N. Harborth J. Heyes J.A. Jeffs L.B. John M. et al.Nature. 2006; 441: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Two factors seem to control the persistence of silencing—the rate of cell division of the targeted cell, where siRNA dilution with each cell division reduces the siRNA concentration, and the presence of the target mRNA within the cell. Silencing is sustained in slowly dividing cells expressing the target mRNA (Song et al., 2003aSong E. Lee S.K. Dykxhoorn D.M. Novina C. Zhang D. Crawford K. Cerny J. Sharp P.A. Lieberman J. Manjunath N. Shankar P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7174-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Infrequent dosing may be possible for some nondividing or slowly dividing tissues, such as the brain and the liver, but not for other targets, such as cancer cells. Whether and how the presence of the target mRNA enhances stability of the siRNA requires further investigation but needs to be considered when designing interventions. For example, an siRNA-based microbicide used to prevent viral infection might last longer if the siRNAs target host receptor genes rather than viral genes. The plasma half-life of siRNAs can be extended substantially (from minutes to days) by the siRNAs forming complexes with other molecules or becoming incorporated into particles (to bypass the renal filtration cutoff of ∼50 kDa) and by chemical modification to avoid exonuclease and endonuclease digestion. These modifications generally come at the price of reduced intracellular silencing efficiency, presumably because the RNAi machinery is optimized to handle unmodified endogenous RNAs and because the unmodified active strand is stable once inside the cell (at least if the target is present). Given that nuclease sensitivity is sequence dependent, one intelligent strategy is to minimize the amount of chemical modification and restrict it to the linkages or residues that are most susceptible to attack (Soutschek et al., 2004Soutschek J. Akinc A. Bramlage B. Charisse K. Constien R. Donoghue M. Elbashir S. Geick A. Hadwiger P. Harborth J. et al.Nature. 2004; 432: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). All drugs, and siRNAs are no exception, have unintended off-target effects. Some genes containing sequences with imperfect complementarity may be unintentionally silenced by mRNA cleavage or by translational inhibition (Jackson et al., 2003Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). Off-target effects occur by siRNAs mimicking microRNA target recognition and gene silencing (Jackson et al., 2006bJackson A.L. Burchard J. Schelter J. Chau B.N. Cleary M. Lim L. Linsley P.S. RNA. 2006; 12: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). An attractive method for minimizing off-target effects was recently described: chemical modification of the second residue in the active strand of the siRNA (a key residue in the seed region for endogenous microRNA activity) may suppress unintended off-target effects without interfering with silencing of the target gene (Jackson et al., 2006aJackson A.L. Burchard J. Leake D. Reynolds A. Schelter J. Guo J. Johnson J.M. Lim L. Karpilow J. Nichols K. et al.RNA. 2006; 12: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The rules for predicting off-target gene regulation are still too crude to be completely useful, although sequences with a high degree of similarity to the target by BLAST search need to be avoided. Unintended off-target changes in mRNA can be surveyed using mRNA microarrays, which generally show that few off-target mRNAs are reduced by more than 2-fold. However, for some genes changes of 2-fold or less may be clinically significant. It is more difficult to evaluate the extent of unintended changes in protein expression. As translational inhibition is less effective at silencing gene expression than mRNA cleavage, the hope is that most of these off-target effects will be too weak to cause clinical problems. Indeed there has been an encouraging lack of toxicity so far in both animal and early clinical studies. It is unlikely that microarray analyses will be helpful to screen and modify siRNA sequences to predict and minimize off-target effects before their clinical testing. More likely they will provide useful tools to guide modifications if unexplained toxicity is observed. In addition to silencing unintended targets, siRNAs could potentially cause problems by triggering immune and inflammatory pathways. These may include the interferon response and toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, which are designed to recognize double-stranded RNAs of invading viral pathogens (Sledz et al., 2003Sledz C.A. Holko M. de Veer M.J. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Innate immune cells, which sound the alarm during viral invasion, need to tolerate endogenous microRNAs and can distinguish between foreign RNAs and host RNAs. The interferon pathway is not efficiently triggered by double-stranded RNAs less than 30 nucleotides in length, providing an adequate size window for siRNA drugs (the active strand of endogenous single-stranded RNAs binding to RISC is only about 21 nucleotides long). Longer siRNAs that need to be processed by Dicer but are still below the 30 nucleotide cutoff may be more effective at silencing than 21 nucleotide siRNAs, possibly because Dicer processing helps to incorporate siRNAs into the RISC (Kim et al., 2005Kim D.H. Behlke M.A. Rose S.D. Chang M.S. Choi S. Rossi J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). In a few animal studies showing siRNA therapeutic benefit, induction of interferon-responsive genes has not been detected, even with sensitive real-time RT-PCR assays. Activating TLRs turns out to be sequence specific, with the preferred trigger being GU-rich sequences (Judge et al., 2005Judge A.D. Sood V. Shaw J.R. Fang D. McClintock K. MacLachlan I. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Candidate siRNAs for clinical use (and for some types of research) will need to be screened to verify that they do not activate inflammatory pathways. Because the number of effective siRNAs for any gene is generally large, excluding siRNAs that bind to TLRs is not likely to preclude silencing any target gene. In addition to avoiding TLR-activating sequences, chemical modifications of the siRNAs that do not abrogate silencing can be used to block TLR activation. Several strategies are available to bypass the unintended immunostimulatory effects of siRNA drugs, and this potential toxicity is not likely to impede siRNA drug development. For some important clinical applications, notably treating viral infection and cancer, siRNA drug resistance by selection of escape mutations of the target sequence during viral replication or cancer cell division is likely to develop. This may be more of a problem for siRNAs than for other types of small molecule drugs, as synonymous mutations can interfere with siRNA recognition while leaving the encoded protein untouched. One way around this potential problem is to design siRNAs that target sequences that are conserved at the nucleotide level (these exist even for highly variable viruses like HIV). Another strategy is to use both strands of an siRNA to target more than one gene or sequence, including drug-resistant variants. Alternatively, siRNA cocktails can be used to hit multiple genes and, in the case of viruses, to target both viral genes and host genes. By focusing on targets that are essential for viral replication or cell division, resistance mutations are more likely to interfere with the underlying fitness of the virus or cell. Whether drug resistance develops more readily for siRNAs than for other types of drugs is hard to predict without doing clinical studies. If resistance does prove to be a clinical problem, one important advantage of siRNA drugs is the relative ease, compared to other small molecule drugs, with which resistance can be overcome by simple changes in the siRNA sequence. The same strategies for preventing anticipated drug resistance will also lead to the development of drugs suitable for treating the diversity of viral strains or cancer variants. A potential cause of toxicity of siRNA drugs is that introducing exogenous siRNAs into a cell can interfere with the processing and function of endogenous microRNAs. Copiously expressing microRNA-like shRNAs, either using a virus (Lu and Cullen, 2004Lu S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12868-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or gene therapy vector (Grimm et al., 2006Grimm D. Streetz K.L. Jopling C.L. Storm T.A. Pandey K. Davis C.R. Marion P. Salazar F. Kay M.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar), interferes with endogenous microRNA nuclear export by exportin 5. Although siRNA drugs, introduced directly into the cytoplasm, will not compete with microRNAs at this stage, large intracellular siRNA concentrations might compete for limiting amounts of Dicer (for longer siRNA precursor drugs) or RISC. This consideration might set a limit on the number of different siRNAs that could be incorporated into a drug cocktail. The catalytic nature of mRNA cleavage by siRNAs, where the same RISC can be recycled over and over to cleave many mRNAs, works to the advantage of siRNA drugs. In fact, it may take only about 1000 siRNA molecules/cell to silence gene expression efficiently (a rough estimate derived from the frequencies of individual endogenous microRNAs in cells). Quantitative information about the relative numbers of Dicer and RISC molecules and endogenous microRNAs in different cells, together with information about the numbers of siRNAs required for efficient gene silencing, would be helpful for anticipating whether this toxicity might be an issue. There is a slim hint from the Sirna Therapeutics phase I study of intraocular injection of siRNAs targeting the VEGF pathway to treat age-related macular degeneration. The study results suggested that too high a concentration of siRNAs might be less effective than lower concentrations, but the number of subjects treated at each dose is too small to draw any conclusions. Although many of the potential hurdles that stand in the way of harnessing RNAi for therapy seem surmountable, cautious optimism is in order. Although the anticipated problems seem to be solvable, it is often the unanticipated problems that sidetrack drug development. J.L. is supported by NIH grant u19 AI056900.

Phylogenetic clustering inferred three clades coincident with their geographical origin and case-fatality rate; the latter implicated putative proteins that mediate viral virulence differences. Analysis of the viral linear DNA genome suggests that its evolution involved direct descent and DNA end-region recombination events. Knowing the sequences will help understand the viral proteome and improve diagnostic test precision, therapeutics, and systems for their assessment."

To this end pathogens possess several NO·-metabolizing enzymes. Here we show that the flavohemoglobin Hmp is the principal enzyme responsible for aerobic NO· metabolism by Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. We further show that Hmp is required for Salmonella virulence in mice, in contrast to S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, flavorubredoxin, or cytochrome c nitrite reductase.

This provides a rationale for the regulation of hmp expression by the transcriptional repressor NsrR in response to both nitrosative stress and intracellular free iron concentration.

Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 820-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Superoxide (O2·¯) and nitric oxide (NO·) in turn can be converted to other reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (·OH), nitrogen dioxide (NO2·), peroxynitrite (ONOO–), dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), and nitrosothiols (RSNO). Enzymes responsible for the metabolism and detoxification of reactive oxygen species, including catalases, superoxide dismutases, and peroxidases, have been extensively studied and shown to contribute to bacterial virulence in experimental infections (2Seyler Jr., R.W. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Fang F.C. DeGroote M.A. Foster J.W. Baumler A.J. Ochsner U. Testerman T. Bearson S. Giard J.C.

However, although some bacterial enzymes capable of RNS detoxification have been characterized, their importance in pathogenesis has not been directly demonstrated. The enteric pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium possess a number of enzymes with the ability to metabolize RNS. The flavohemoglobin Hmp detoxifies NO· by an O2-dependent denitrosylase mechanism, producing NO3- under aerobic or microaerobic conditions or by the slower O2-independent reduction of NO· to N2O (5Poole R.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Hausladen A. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thompson A. Rhen M. Hinton J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The GSH-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase AdhC has S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase activity (11Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), which can limit levels of S-nitrosoglutathione formed during nitrosative stress. Last, the periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase NrfA, which reduces NO2- to NH3, may also be able to directly reduce NO· (12Poock S.R. Leach E.R. Moir J.W. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23664-23669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The biochemistry of Hmp has been extensively characterized. As one of bacterial globins, Hmp binds NO· at its heme ligand. Structural analysis of flavohemoglobins has also revealed binding domains for FAD and NAD(P) in the C-terminal portion of the molecule (13Ilari A. Bonamore A. Farina A. Johnson K.A. Boffi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23725-23732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This reductase domain is believed to transfer electrons from NAD(P)H to the ferric heme iron ligand via FAD, ultimately resulting in reduction of the liganded NO· to form a heme-bound nitroxyl anion (NO–) equivalent (7Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10108-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Poole R.K. Ioannidis N. Orii Y. Proc. Biol.

NO–/HNO is alternatively converted to NO3- or N2O in the presence or absence of O2, respectively. Biochemical studies of the Escherichia coli Hmp enzyme have revealed some evidence that Hmp might exacerbate oxidative stress under selected circumstances. In the absence of NO, Hmp binds O2. NADH oxidase activity of Hmp can then generate O2·¯ at the heme, and further dismutation or reduction could produce H2O2 (16Membrillo-Hernandez J. Ioannidis N. Poole R.K.

J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, by consuming NADH and reducing free flavins, Hmp has the ability to reduce external electron acceptors, including ferric iron (Fe3+) (18Andrews S.C. Shipley D. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.

Homology between Fre and the C-terminal portion of Hmp (22Frey A.D. Kallio P.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) as well as the ability of Hmp to act as a ferrisiderophore reductase (18Andrews S.C. Shipley D. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) supports a possible role of Hmp in reducing intracellular iron under physiological conditions. To examine the importance of RNS metabolism to Salmonella virulence in mice, we have constructed Salmonella mutant strains lacking Hmp, NorV, AdhC, or NrfA. Infections of mice with these strains show that the flavohemoglobin Hmp plays the most important role of these enzymes in detoxifying host-derived RNS produced during Salmonella infections. We have also used site-specific mutations to demonstrate the contribution of the heme and flavin binding domains of Hmp to NO· denitrosylase activity and the potentiation of oxidative stress. Finally, we have elucidated the mechanism by which hmp transcription is regulated in response to nitrosative stress and intracellular iron concentration. Media and Chemicals—Luria-Bertani (LB) complex medium and minimal E medium containing 0.2% glucose were used for the routine growth of bacterial cells (23Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. GSNO was synthesized from the reaction between GSH and acidified sodium nitrite as described previously (24De Groote M.A. Granger D. Xu Y. Campbell G. Prince R. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6399-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Spermine-NONOate and diethylamine triamine-NONOate were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). To prepare an NO· stock solution, phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 20 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid was deoxygenated with ultra pure helium gas and then saturated with NO· gas (National Specialty Gases, Durham, NC) that had been purified across an alkali trap. The NO· stock solution was injected via a gas-tight Hamilton syringe into a cell suspension. Construction of Mutant Bacterial Strains—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. S. enterica serovar typhimurium wild-type 14028s was used as a parent strain for all mutant constructs. Protocols for Salmonella genetic manipulations were as described previously (25Bang I.S. Kim B.H. Foster J.W. Park Y.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2245-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Deletion mutations were constructed using the λ-Red recombinase method (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11136) Google Scholar) with modifications of DNA primers designed for the construction of deletion mutations (supplemental Table 2). Mutant construction was completed by transducing each mutation into a clean wild-type background and confirming the mutated allele by PCR. General molecular biological techniques were performed according to standard protocols (27Sambrook J. Russel D. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 2001Google Scholar). To construct an nsrR complementing plasmid, the nsrR gene was amplified from S. typhimurium chromosomal DNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers 5′-CAGTGTGATACATTGCTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCTAGAGACATTGAGGTTC-3′ and cloning into pBAD30. Mouse Virulence Assay—Female 6–8-week-old C56BL/6, 129Xi/SvJ (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and C3H/HeN (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) mice were used for the determination of Salmonella virulence. C57BL/6 iNOS–/– mice were bred at the University of Washington and University of Colorado Health Science Center animal facilities according to the animal care and use regulations of each institution. To inhibit iNOS expression in C3H/HeN mice, L-NIL (L-N6-1-iminoethyl-lysine; 500 μg ml–1) was administered with drinking water throughout the experiment. Salmonella cells were grown overnight in LB medium and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Difco). For acute infections, 500 colony-forming units (cfu) and 2000 cfu were administered intraperitoneally to C56BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice, respectively. For competition assays in chronically infected mice, strains were mixed at a 1:1 ratio of hmp mutant to wild type before oral administration of 2 × 105 cfu to 129Xi/SvJ mice. Infected mice were sacrificed at designated time intervals for isolation of mesenteric lymph nodes, which were homogenized in PBS, diluted, and plated onto selective and non-selective media for quantitation of cfu. Each virulence assay was performed a minimum of two times with 10 mice per group. Macrophage Killing Assay—Peritoneal exudate cells from wild-type C57BL/6 or congenic iNOS–/– mice were harvested 4 days after intraperitoneal inoculation of 1 mg ml–1 sodium periodate, as described previously (28De Groote M.A. Ochsner U.A. Shiloh M.U. Nathan C. McCord J.M. Dinauer M.C. Libby S.J. Vazquez-Torres A. Xu Y. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13997-14001Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The peritoneal exudate cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Sigma-Aldrich). Macrophages were selected by adherence to a 96-well plate and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Selected groups of macrophages were incubated with 200 units ml–1 murine interferon-γ (Invitrogen) 16 h before infection. Macrophages were challenged with S. typhimurium opsonized with 10% normal mouse serum at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 and allowed to internalize the bacteria for 15 min. Extracellular bacteria were removed by washing with prewarmed medium containing 6 μg ml–1 gentamicin. The Salmonella-infected macrophages were lysed 20 h after challenge, and the surviving bacteria were enumerated on LB agar plates. Results are expressed as percent survival. Nitrite production by macrophages in response to infection was determined by the Griess reaction (29Vazquez-Torres A. Jones-Carson J. Mastroeni P. Ischiropoulos H. Fang F.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Measurement of NO· Consumption—Wild-type S. typhimurium, hmp mutant S. typhimurium, and wild-type S. typhimurium heated to 95 °C for 10 min were resuspended in buffer (A590 ≈ 2) before the addition of NO· (∼3 μm). NO· consumption was measured in 1 ml of PBS with 20 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid using an NO· electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Measurement of S-Nitrosothiols—SNO levels in bacterial cells were measured essentially as described (30Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Salmonella grown in minimal medium were treated with 2 mm GSNO for 1 h before lysis by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and either treated or not treated (total XNO) with HgCl2 to deplete S-nitrosothiols. Quantities of total S-nitrosothiols in the lysates were measured by photolysis-chemiluminescence (31Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Standard curves were derived using S-nitrosoglutathione, and data were normalized to total protein content. Measurement of Growth Kinetics—Growth kinetics were measured by determining the optical density at 600 nm (A600 nm) at 37 °C with agitation on a BioScreen C Microbiology Microplate reader (Growth Curves USA, Piscataway, NJ). Cells grown overnight in LB medium were diluted in PBS to A600 nm = 0.1 before inoculating equal quantities into minimal E glucose (0.2%) medium containing various NO· donors. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the S. typhimurium hmp Gene—The hmp gene was amplified from S. typhimurium 14028s chromosomal DNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with primers 5′-TCTCTAGATTTTCACATAAAGGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-AACGGGCGTTCGCCTTACCGATA-3′. The purified product was digested with restriction enzyme XbaI and cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Identity of the cloned insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing and performing phenotypic complementation in hmp mutant bacteria before use as the template plasmid for site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of (32Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, two complementary mutagenic primers and Pfu DNA polymerase were used to amplify DNA from the template plasmid. The PCR product was treated with restriction enzyme DpnI to specifically cut methylated parental plasmid DNA sequences before purification, ligation, and transformation into Electromax DH10B competent cells (Invitrogen). Each mutated construct was confirmed by sequencing. Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: H85A, 5′-AATCGCGCAGAAGGCCACCAGCTT-3′ and 5′-TTTTCTACCGCCGGCAGCAAC-3′; Y206A/S207A, 5′-TTCCGCCAAGCTGCACTGACCCGT-3′ and 5′-CACCTGATGCGCAAAACCTTC-3′. Hydrogen Peroxide Killing Assay—Bacterial cells grown overnight in LB broth were diluted 1:1000 into fresh broth and reincubated. Log-phase cells (A600 nm ≈ 0.3–0.5) were challenged with 2 mm H2O2 at a density of 106 cfu ml–1 in LB medium at 37 °C. 3 mm KCN was added for 30 min before H2O2 challenge to inhibit respiration (this treatment did not affect bacterial survival over the 30-min time period). Viable counts were measured by dilution in M9 minimal medium (0.2% glucose) containing catalase (200 unit ml–1) and plating onto LB agar at timed intervals. Percentage survival was calculated by dividing cfu after challenge by cfu before challenge and multiplying by 100. Measurement of Heme Content—The heme content of cells expressing wild-type and mutant Hmp were determined by incubating cell lysates containing 10 μg of total cell protein in PBS buffer containing 0.2% 3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine (dianisidine, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.3% H2O2 at room temperature (33Omodeo Sale F. Marchesini S. Fishman P.H. Berra B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 450 nm was read after 1 h of incubation using an Optimax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). After subtracting the absorbance of samples carrying empty vector, the relative heme content of mutant Hmp proteins was calculated by normalizing absorbance with that of the wild-type Hmp sample. RNA Purification and Quantitative Reverse-transcriptase Real-time PCR—Levels of hmp mRNA were measured under various conditions including low or high iron and after NO· exposure. Log phase bacteria (A600 nm ≈ 0.4–0.6) were treated with 200 μm 2,2′-dipyridyl, 200 μm FeCl3, or 1 mm Spermine-NONOate and incubated for 30 min. Transcription was stopped by adding a 2× volume of the RNA Protect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and RNA was purified using the Qiagen RNA purification kit. Quantitative real-time Reverse transcription-PCR reaction was performed as described previously (34Bang I.S. Frye J.G. McClelland M. Velayudhan J. Fang F.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 811-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primer sets used were 5′-CTTGACGCACAAACCATCGCTA-3′ and 5′-CGGGTTATGCGTAAACATACGG-3′ (hmp), 5′-CAGGCGGTTAGTGGTGAACGTC-3′ and 5′-GCCGCCTGGGGTTCTACTATGA-3′ (iroN), and 5′-GTGAAATGGGCACTGTTGAACTG-3′ and 5′-TTCCAGCAGATAGGTAATGGCTTC-3′ (rpoD). Each sample was independently tested three times and assayed in duplicate during each run. A Mutation in hmp but Not the adhC, norV, or nrfA Genes Attenuates Salmonella Virulence in Mice—To compare the contribution of flavohemoglobin, GSNO reductase, flavorubredoxin, and cytochrome c nitrite reductase to Salmonella virulence, the virulence of isogenic hmp, adhC, norV, and nrfA mutant and parental S. typhimurium 14028s wild-type bacteria was compared after intraperitoneal inoculation into mice. No significant differences in virulence were observed in genetically susceptible (Nramp1–) C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). However, in genetically resistant (Nramp1+/+) C3H/HeN mice, the hmp mutant strain exhibited almost complete loss of virulence, whereas adhC, norV, or nrfA mutants possessed virulence similar to that of wild-type bacteria (Fig. 1A). Complementation of the hmp virulence phenotype in vivo was not attempted because hmp is monocistronic, excluding the possibility that the hmp mutation exerted a polar effect. Moreover, expression of hmp from a plasmid vector was found to have a detrimental effect on cell growth (see below). Notably, treatment of mice with the iNOS inhibitor L-NIL (35Moore W.M. Webber R.K. Jerome G.M. Tjoeng F.S. Misko T.P. Currie M.G. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3886-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) restored virulence to hmp mutant Salmonella (Fig. 1B), indicating that the flavohemoglobin Hmp promotes Salmonella virulence by detoxifying RNS generated by host cells. Moreover, in comparison with wild-type Salmonella, hmp mutants were more susceptible to killing by murine macrophages expressing iNOS than to congenic iNOS–/– macrophages (Fig. 1C). Macrophages infected with hmp mutants produced slightly higher quantities of nitrite compared with macrophages infected with wild-type Salmonella (Fig. 1D), although it cannot be distinguished whether this represents direct consumption of NO· by Hmp or lesser production of NO· in macrophages with greater organism burdens. Mice that are highly resistant to Salmonella infection can be persistently infected with wild-type S. typhimurium in mesenteric lymph nodes (36Monack D.M. Bouley D.M. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hmp is required for persistent Salmonella infection, we challenged 129Xi/SvJ mice with oral inocula containing equal quantities of wild-type and isogenic hmp mutant bacteria. At intervals after infection, mice were sacrificed and competition index was calculated by enumerating bacterial load in mesentric lymph nodes. The hmp mutant strain was not significantly different in competitive index at day 5 (0.465 ± 0.189) but was 100-fold less abundant than wild-type bacteria after 98 days of infection (0.017 ± 0.019). These results demonstrate that the flavohemoglobin Hmp promotes Salmonella virulence during chronic infection as well as during acute lethal infection of mice. An hmp Mutant S. typhimurium Strain Is Unable to Metabolize Nitric Oxide, Leading to S-Nitrosylation of Proteins and Cell Filamentation—The rate of NO· consumption by hmp mutant and wild-type bacteria cultured in minimal medium was measured using an NO·-sensitive electrode. Wild-type bacteria rapidly consumed NO·, whereas hmp mutants consumed NO· as slowly as heat-inactivated wild-type cells, demonstrating that Hmp is responsible for virtually all NO· decomposition in Salmonella under these aerobic experimental conditions (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, the growth of hmp mutant bacteria was severely impaired in the presence of NO·-donor compounds spermine-NONOate (37Morley D. Maragos C.M. Zhang X.Y. Boignon M. Wink D.A. Keefer L.K. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), diethylamine triamine-NONOate (37Morley D. Maragos C.M. Zhang X.Y. Boignon M. Wink D.A. Keefer L.K. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and GSNO (24De Groote M.A. Granger D. Xu Y. Campbell G. Prince R. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6399-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, hmp mutant cells treated with GSNO accumulated approximately twice as much S-nitrosylated proteins compared with wild-type (Fig. 2C). GSNO has previously been shown to induce cell filamentation in association with the SOS response, suggesting that nitrosative stress arrests DNA replication (38Schapiro J.M. Libby S.J. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Microscopy revealed that hmp mutant bacteria exhibit filamentation after overnight culture in GSNO concentrations (500 μm) insufficient to induce filamentation of wild-type cells (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these observations indicate that Hmp is responsible for the majority of NO· detoxification in Salmonella and can promote bacterial growth during nitrosative stress. Mutation of Either the Heme or Flavoreductase Domain of Hmp Abrogates Salmonella Resistance to Nitrosative Stress—An earlier study showed that separate expression of the E. coli Hmp heme and flavin domains in trans cannot confer resistance to nitrosative stress (39Hernandez-Urzua E. Mills C.E. White G.P. Contreras-Zentella M.L. Escamilla E. Vasudevan S.G. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Poole R.K. J. Biol.

To evaluate the importance of each domain in the activity of intact Hmp protein, site-directed mutagenesis of the Salmonella Hmp heme and flavoreductase domains was performed. Mutant and wild-type hmp genes were expressed from an episomal vector in an hmp mutant background. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the E. coli Hmp protein (13Ilari A. Bonamore A. Farina A.

Kallio P.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) identified histidine 85 and tyrosine 206/serine 207 as conserved residues in the Salmonella Hmp heme and flavoreductase domains, respectively. The hmp mutant cells harboring wild-type hmp on a plasmid exhibited GSNO resistance equivalent to that of wild-type cells. However, alanine substitution of histidine 85 in the heme domain and tyrosine 206/serine 207 in the flavoreductase domain abrogated GSNO resistance (Fig. 3), demonstrating the requirement of both heme and flavoreductase domains for NO· metabolism by Hmp. This result is consistent with the proposed transfer of electrons from NAD(P)H to FAD to heme for NO· detoxification (7Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10108-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Poole R.K. Rogers N.J. D'Mello R.A. Hughes M.N. Orii Y.

Overexpression of Hmp in the Absence of Nitrosative Stress Increases Salmonella Susceptibility to Hydrogen Peroxide by a Flavoreductase- and Iron-dependent Mechanism—Hmp overexpression from a high copy number plasmid (pBluescript) complemented the NO· resistance of an hmp mutant strain but slowed bacterial growth under aerobic conditions in the absence of nitrosative stress (data not shown) in association with cell filamentation (Fig. 4A), indicating that increased Hmp expression might have deleterious effects. The Conserved Domain Data base (40Marchler-Bauer A. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) revealed homology between the C-terminal portion of Hmp and the flavin reductase Fre. Common ferric iron reductase activity of Hmp and Fre (18Andrews S.C. Shipley D. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) also suggested functional conservation. Under conditions of NADH excess, the Fre flavin reductase of E. coli reduces FAD to FADH2, which can in turn act as a ferric iron reductant and drive the Fenton reaction (21Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For example, in non-respiring cells, a fre mutation protects cells from iron-dependent oxidative damage, and fre overexpression enhances susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (21Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined whether overexpression of Hmp affects Salmonella"

Recent efforts in understanding Titan's methane hydrological cycle have focused on occasional cloud outbursts near the south pole or cloud streaks at southern mid-latitudes and the mechanisms of their formation. It is not known, however, if the clouds produce rain or if there are also non-convective clouds, as predicted by several models. Here we show that the in situ data on the methane concentration and temperature profile in Titan's troposphere point to the presence of layered optically thin stratiform clouds. The data indicate an upper methane ice cloud and a lower, barely visible, liquid methane-nitrogen cloud, with a gap in between. The lower, liquid, cloud produces drizzle that reaches the surface. These non-convective methane clouds are quasi-permanent features supported by the global atmospheric circulation, indicating that methane precipitation occurs wherever there is slow upward motion. This drizzle is a persistent component of Titan's methane hydrological cycle and, by wetting the surface on a global scale, plays an active role in the surface geology of Titan."

This work was performed to determine whether 17beta-estradiol (E2), the predominant circulating ovarian steroid, is carcinogenic in human breast epithelial cells and whether nonreceptor mechanisms are involved in the initiation of breast cancer. For this purpose, the effect of four 24 h alternate periods of 70 nM E2 treatment of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) negative MCF-10F cell line on the in vitro expression of neoplastic transformation was evaluated. E2 treatment induced the expression of anchorage-independent growth, loss of ductulogenesis in collagen, invasiveness in Matrigel, and loss of 9p11-13. Only invasive cells that exhibited a 4p15.3-16 deletion were tumorigenic. Tumors were poorly differentiated ER-alpha and progesterone receptor-negative adenocarcinomas that expressed keratins, EMA, and E-cadherin. Tumors and tumor-derived cell lines exhibited loss of chromosome 4, deletions in chromosomes 3p12.3-13, 8p11.1-21, 9p21-qter, and 18q, and gains in 1p, and 5q15-qter. The induction of complete transformation of MCF-10F cells in vitro confirms the carcinogenicity of E2, supporting the concept that this hormone could act as an initiator of breast cancer in women. This model provides a unique system for understanding the genomic changes that intervene for leading normal cells to tumorigenesis and for testing the functional role of specific genomic events taking place during neoplastic transformation."

The mechanism (or mechanisms) ensuring fidelity of transcription by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAPs) is not fully understood. Here, we show that the 3′ end–proximal nucleotide of the nascent transcript stimulates hydrolysis of the penultimate phosphodiester bond by providing active groups and coordination bonds to the RNAP active center. This stimulation is much higher in the case of misincorporated nucleotide. We show that during transcription elongation, the hydrolytic reaction stimulated by misincorporated nucleotides proofreads most of the misincorporation events and thus serves as an intrinsic mechanism of transcription fidelity."

We show that this unexpected reproducibility—the consistency of amplitude and duration of rhodopsin activity—varies in a graded and systematic manner with the number but not the identity of phosphorylation sites on rhodopsin's C terminus. These results indicate that each phosphorylation site provides an independent step in rhodopsin deactivation and that collectively these steps tightly control rhodopsin's active lifetime. Other G protein cascades may exploit a similar mechanism to encode accurately the timing and number of receptor activation."

Here we present evidence that RhoA, the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor ECT-2, and the Rho guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein CYK-4 modulate myosin light-chain activity to create a gradient of actomyosin, which establishes the anterior domain. CYK-4 is enriched within sperm, and paternally donated CYK-4 is required for polarity. These data suggest that CYK-4 provides a molecular link between fertilization and polarity establishment in the one-cell embryo. Orthologs of CYK-4 are expressed in sperm of other species, which suggests that this cue may be evolutionarily conserved."

https://openalex.org/W2043728729,"Efficient clearance of mucus and inhaled pathogens from the lung is dependent on an optimal airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, which is maintained by the regulated transport of sodium and chloride across the airway epithelium. Accumulating evidence suggests that impaired mucus clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways is a result of ASL depletion caused by excessive Na+ absorption through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). However, the cellular mechanisms that result in increased ENaC activity in CF airways are not completely understood. Recently, proteases were shown to modulate the activity of ENaC, but the relevance of this mechanism to the physiologic regulation of ASL volume is unknown. Using primary human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrate that: (i) protease inhibitors are present in the ASL and prevent the activation of near-silent ENaC, (ii) when the ASL volume is increased, endogenous protease inhibitors become diluted, allowing for proteolytic activation of near-silent channels, and (iii) in CF, the normally present near-silent pool of ENaC is constitutively active and the α subunit undergoes increased proteolytic processing. These findings indicate that the ASL volume modulates the activity of ENaC by modification of the serine protease-protease inhibitor balance and that alterations in this balance contribute to excessive Na+ absorption in cystic fibrosis.

Because the airway epithelium is relatively permeable to water, the ASL is roughly isotonic to plasma. Thus ASL volume is dictated by the osmotic driving force established by the oppositely directed transport of Na+ and Cl– across the airway epithelium (2Matsui H. Davis C.W. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. J.

Despite the immense importance of properly regulated ion transport, the cellular mechanisms that result in increased ENaC activity in CF airways are not known. For ENaC to be maximally activated, the α and γ subunits require proteolytic processing (14Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, two distinct pools of channels are present at the apical membrane: (i) mature channels with complex N-glycans and cleaved α and γ subunits; and (ii) immature channels with high mannose type N-glycans and uncleaved subunits. Proteolytic processing in the biosynthetic pathway increases the activity of the channel and is mediated by furin. Channels that bypass proteolytic processing are believed to provide a reserve pool for activation in post-Golgi compartments (15Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q.

In agreement with this hypothesis, an in-active or “near-silent” ENaC population can be activated at the cell surface by proteases, such as channel-activating proteases (CAPs) or trypsin (14Vallet V.

Under physiological conditions, the importance of the near-silent ENaC population and the role of endogenous protease inhibitors in the proteolytic regulation of ENaC are unknown. We reasoned that endogenous protease inhibitors in the ASL might prevent proteolytic activation of near-silent ENaC by CAPs. Accordingly, during periods when the ASL is diminished, the high concentration of protease inhibitors would prevent activation of uncleaved ENaC and further depletion of the ASL. Conversely, when the ASL volume is high, protease inhibitors would be diluted, allowing for CAP-mediated activation of a pool of inactive ENaC, and a resultant increase in Na+ and water absorption. Here, we demonstrate that these mechanisms contribute to the regulation of ENaC activity in primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) and that an altered protease-protease inhibitor balance contributes to Na+ hyperabsorption in CF epithelium. Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cell Culture—HAEC were cultured from excess pathological tissue following lung transplantation and organ donation under a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Investigational Review Board. HAEC were cultured on human placental collagen-coated Costar Transwell filters (0.33 cm2) as described previously (29Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C461-C479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for experimentation following 4–6 weeks of culture at an air-liquid interface. Non-CF HAECs were obtained from two normal donors and 12 donors with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, obliterative bronchiolitis, or primary pulmonary hypertension. Qualitative differences due to disease state were not observed. CF HAECs were obtained from five donors with the following CF genotypes: ΔF508, G551D, and 2789 + 5G→ A. Qualitative differences due to genotype were not observed. ASL Volume Expansion—To expand the ASL volume, 5–100 μl of Ringer's or PBS was gently pipetted onto the apical surface of differentiated HAEC. Where indicated, aprotinin (Sigma) was added to the apical fluid. Cells were then returned to a humidified incubator for the indicated time prior to ISC measurement. HAEC apical secretions were collected by incubating 100 μl of PBS on the apical surface of HAEC for 72 h. 300 μlof pooled conditioned apical fluid was concentrated by precipitation in 1 ml acetone overnight at –20 °C. The apical secretions were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS for subsequent ASL volume expansion experiments. ISC Recordings—Short circuit currents were measured as previously described (29Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C461-C479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In brief, cells cultured on filter supports were mounted in modified Ussing chambers, and the cultures were continuously short circuited with an automatic voltage clamp (Department of Bioengineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Transepithelial resistance was measured by periodically applying a 2.5-mV bipolar voltage pulse and was calculated using Ohm's law. The bathing Ringer's solution was composed of 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm K2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose. Chambers were constantly gassed with a mixture of 95% O2/5% CO2 at 37 °C, which maintained the pH at 7.4. Following a 5 min equilibration period, the base-line ISC was recorded. To determine the amiloride-sensitive ISC (IENaC), amiloride (Sigma) was added to the apical cell chamber to a concentration of 10 μm. Alternatively, 1 μm trypsin (Sigma) was added to the apical surface for 5 min prior to amiloride addition, providing a measure of protease activable channels (Δtrypsin) (20Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C.

To determine stimulated CFTR currents (ICFTR), after addition of amiloride, 10 μm forskolin (Sigma) and then 10 μm CFTRinh172 (Calbiochem) were added. Surface Biotinylation and Western Blotting—Surface biotinylation and Western blotting was performed as described previously (30Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated HAEC cultures grown on filter supports were placed on ice and the apical surface was washed with ice cold PBS plus 1 mm CaCl2, to remove cellular debris. Subsequently, the apical surface of the HAEC filters was incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer (85 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 15 mm Na2B4O7, pH 9). After 20 min, the biotinylation reaction was quenched with PBS plus 10% fetal bovine serum and the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS + Ca+. The cells were then lysed in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm EGTA, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The biotinylated proteins in 100 μg of cellular lysate were recovered by incubation with streptavidin beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were resolved using standard SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was then immunoblotted using antisera from rabbits immunized with an N-terminal αENaC peptide, as described previously (30Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen.

Subsequently the blots were stripped and re-probed with monoclonal β-actin antibodies (Sigma). Band intensity was quantified by densitometry (Quantiscan). To demonstrate antigen specificity, peptide competition was performed by incubating 10 μg/ml of the immunizing peptide with the antisera for 2 h at 37 °C prior to immunoblotting. Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. The percent of base-line IENaC was determined by normalizing amiloride-sensitive current to values obtained from matched HAEC from the same donor on the same day of experimentation. Significance was determined by analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analysis or by Student's t test where appropriate. Results were confirmed in at least three independent experiments using HAEC cultured from different lung tissues. ASL Volume Expansion Increases the Amiloride-sensitive ISC— The base-line ISC for HAEC at air-liquid interface averaged 34.3 ± 1.9 μA/cm2 (n = 81). Following 24 h of ASL volume expansion with 100 μl of Ringer's, the mean ISC increased to 77.1 ± 4.1 μA/cm2 (n = 60, p < 0.001 versus control). Following the addition of 10 μm amiloride, the residual ISC was the same in control and ASL expansion conditions (12.2 ± 0.5 μA/cm2 versus 13.4 ± 0.7 μA/cm2, not significant). This indicates that the increased ISC observed with ASL volume expansion reflects conductive ENaC-mediated sodium absorption. ICFTR, defined as the CFTRinh172-sensitive current following forskolin stimulation, was not significantly altered by ASL volume expansion (9.8 ± 0.7 versus 9.9 ± 0.6 μA/cm2, n = 15 and 11). Transepithelial potential difference increased from 12.1 ± 0.6 mV to 26.2 ± 1.3 mV following ASL volume expansion (p < 0.001). Transepithelial resistance decreased from 492 ± 18 Ω·cm2 to 407 ± 20 Ω·cm2 (p = 0.002). Thus, ASL volume expansion increased the amiloride-sensitive ISC (IENaC) 2–3-fold, consistent with increased ENaC activity. We next determined the influence of time and dose on the changes in ENaC activity following ASL volume expansion. To assess the kinetics, the ASL volume of matched HAEC was expanded with 100 μl of Ringer's for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h prior to measurement of the amiloride-sensitive ISC. Representative ISC tracings and mean IENaC are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. In this series of experiments, the air-liquid base-line IENaC was 23.7 ± 5 μA/cm2, and increased to 87.7 ± 3.8 μA/cm2 at 24 h (p = 0.0005). Following the initial rise at 24 h, IENaC declined to 41.4 ± 5 μA/cm2 at 72 h (p = 0.26 compared with base line). The ISC of matched control filters at air-liquid interface increased by 2.6 ± 3.3 μA/cm2 over the 72-h interval (p > 0.05, n = 3). Thus, the increase in IENaC due to ASL volume expansion is maximal at 24 h, after which time IENaC declines to near base line. To further define the kinetics of the IENaC response to ASL expansion, the ASL volume was increased with 100 μl of Ringer's solution 0.5, 1, 4, and 24 h prior to measurement of amiloride-sensitive ISC. The IENaC was normalized to that of matched air-liquid HAEC and fitted to a first order exponential equation (% base line = y0 + ae–kx). As shown in Fig. 1C, there is a rapid increase in IENaC following ASL volume expansion (t1/2 = 0.5 ± 0.09 h). Additionally, the rate of IENaC decline following the removal of excess apical fluid was assessed. For this series of experiments, the ASL volume was expanded for 24 h, and the excess apical fluid was subsequently aspirated at 0, 4, 12, and 24 h prior to measurement of IENaC. Following the removal of excess ASL, IENaC returned to base line over ∼12 h (t1/2 = 2.8 ± 0.8 h, see Fig. 1C). Because of the rapidity of these changes, all ISC measurements were obtained following a brief 5-min equilibration period in the Ussing chamber. To assess the effect of increasing ASL volume, 0, 5, 50, or 100 μl of Ringer's solution was added to the apical surface of HAEC for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1D, IENaC increased proportionately with increasing ASL volume. Volume increases above 100 μl had no further effect (data not shown). Thus, the increase in IENaC following ASL volume expansion was both time-dependent and dose-responsive. ASL Volume Expansion Alters the Serine Protease Balance with Endogenous Protease Inhibitors, Allowing for Activation of Near-silent ENaC—The increase in amiloride-sensitive current following treatment with trypsin observed in airway epithelium is thought to reflect the presence of a near-silent pool of ENaC (20Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L813-L819Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 28Tarran R. Trout L. Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. J. Gen.

Chem. 2006; 281: 18901-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because endogenous serine proteases, such as CAPs, are proposed to activate silent channels present on the apical membrane of the epithelium (14Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 18Tong Z. Illek B. Bhagwandin V.J. Verghese G.M. Caughey G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L928-L935Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we reasoned that endogenous protease inhibitors must be present in the ASL. To assess this, the effects of aprotinin and trypsin on HAEC with and without expanded ASL volumes were compared (see Fig. 2A). 30 μm aprotinin was administered in either 5 or 100 μlof PBS to the apical surface of HAEC for 24 h prior to ISC measurement. These apical volumes were selected because 5 μl did not alter IENaC at 24 h (see Fig. 1D), and 100 μl caused the maximal ASL volume expansion response (data not shown). In air-liquid conditions (5 μl added), exposure to aprotinin for 24 h did not significantly alter base-line ISC, suggesting that an aprotinin-like protease inhibitor is endogenously present in the ASL. However, under ASL volume expansion, aprotinin had a profound effect, decreasing base-line ISC from 84.8 ± 8.9 to 41.4 ± 8.6 μA/cm2 (p = 0.006). This suggests that the increase in IENaC following ASL volume expansion is due to dilution of a protease inhibitor. We then reasoned that if ASL volume expansion is diluting a protease inhibitor, thereby allowing for protease mediated activation of near-silent ENaC, the activating effect of trypsin would be lost following 24 h of ASL volume expansion. To evaluate this, the ΔISC induced by 1 μm typsin (Δtrypsin) was compared in HAEC maintained at air-liquid and after ASL volume expansion (see Fig. 2A). The addition of trypsin increased the ISC in air-liquid conditions from 34.9 ± 7.5 to 56.9 ± 8.4 μA/cm2 reflecting the presence of protease susceptible channels (p < 0.001). Conversely, the mucosal addition of trypsin did not affect the ISC of cultures under ASL volume expansion (95.9 ± 4.5 versus 101.7 ± 5.2 μA/cm2, p = 0.4), suggesting that the pool of silent channels had previously been activated by endogenous proteases. To further characterize the relationship between ASL volume expansion and aprotinin sensitivity, aprotinin dose titrations were performed in HAEC under basal and expanded ASL volumes. As shown in Fig. 2B, aprotinin had virtually no effect on IENaC in HAEC under air-liquid conditions at all concentrations examined (p = 0.57, n = 3). Conversely, HAEC with ASL volume expansion exhibited a classic dose response to increasing aprotinin concentration. When fit to the Hill equation, the IC50 was 13.5 ± 2.1 μm (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001) and IENaC decreased to the level of air-liquid cultures with 75 μm aprotinin (17.9 ± 4.1 versus 17.1 ± 0.79 μA/cm2, p = 0.857, n = 3). While the data in Fig. 2B are representative of the relationship between ASL volume expansion and aprotinin sensitivity, the aprotinin IC50 varied among the different cell lines that we tested (mean IC50 9.1 ± 6.8 μm aprotinin, n = 54, from nine tissue donors). To determine whether protease susceptible ENaC activity exhibits a dose response relationship to increasing ASL volume, the ΔISC following mucosal trypsin exposure was measured in HAEC across a range of ASL volumes. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, increasing apical volume induced a stepwise increase in ISC. In parallel, the ΔISC induced by trypsin decreased stepwise from 26.8 ± 5.4 μA/cm2 at basal ASL depth to –0.4 ± 1.31 μA/cm2 with 100 μl of excess apical volume (p < 0.001, n = 3). The findings that Na+ conductance increases and that trypsin susceptible ISC decreases with escalating ASL volume suggest that a pool of near-silent ENaC is activated by endogenous CAPs when the ASL volume increases. Protease Inhibitors Are Present in the ASL That Inhibit Na+ Conductance by Preventing Proteolytic Activation of ENaC—To directly determine whether the ASL contains protease inhibitors which inhibit ENaC, we examined whether the apical secretions from HAEC could prevent the proteolytic activation of ENaC following ASL expansion. The ASL was expanded for 24 h with 100 μl of PBS ± the apical secretions collected from parallel filters prior to measurement of IENaC and trypsin stimulated ISC (Fig. 3). The presence of an inhibitory factor in the ASL is supported by the finding that apical secretions markedly attenuated the increase in IENaC induced by ASL volume expansion toward the current level observed for air-liquid interface cultures (p < 0.001, n = 14). Additionally, when the ASL was expanded with reconstituted HAEC apical secretions, the pool of trypsin susceptible channels was restored (p < 0.001, n = 6–14). The findings that the apical secretions of HAEC inhibit ENaC and maintain a pool of protease activated channels strongly suggest that endogenous protease inhibitors in the ASL regulate channel-activating proteases. Excessive Proteolysis of ENaC in Cystic Fibrosis Epithelium— Next, we evaluated whether altered proteolytic regulation of ENaC contributes to excessive Na+ absorption in CF. To assess this, the effects of aprotinin and trypsin were compared between normal and CF HAEC (Fig. 4). Overnight exposure to 10 μm aprotinin in 5 μl of PBS caused a 39.4 ± 6.3% decrease in IENaC in CF HAEC, whereas Na+ absorption was only inhibited by 18.2 ± 7.7% in normal epithelium (p = 0.043, n = 15). This suggests that there is a protease inhibitor deficiency in the ASL of CF epithelium that permits constitutive activation of ENaC by CAPs. Furthermore, the activating effect of 1 μm trypsin on IENaC in CF HAEC was half of that seen in normal HAEC (62.6 ± 8.3% versus 115.5 ± 9.2% increase, p < 0.001, n > 27), suggesting that fewer near-silent channels are present on the apical surface of CF epithelium. Likewise, CF HAEC had a diminished ability to increase IENaC following ASL volume expansion for 24 h (238.2 ± 16.1% increase in normal versus 77.9 ± 25.7% increase in CF, p = 0.002, n > 6). Therefore, the finding that the inducible pool of near-silent ENaC, present in normal HAEC, is constitutively activated in CF cells suggests that unregulated proteolytic activation of ENaC leads to Na+ hyperabsorption and promotes ASL depletion in CF. To confirm that the differences in protease and protease inhibitor susceptibility in CF HAEC are due to proteolysis of ENaC, we performed Western blotting on normal and CF HAEC lysate using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against αENaC (30Butterworth M.B.

Stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor Kit are essential for the mast cell development in vivo, as illustrated by the phenotype of mice with null mutations in the Kit (W) or SCF (Sl) loci. Such mice lack tissue mast cells, and also have defects in melanogenesis, gametogenesis, and hematopoiesis (2Ashman L.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1037-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Kit belongs to a subfamily of receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTK) that include the receptors for colony-stimulating factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Ex vivo studies of mast cells or heterologous cells expressing Kit wild type (WT) or various mutants indicate that Kit activates multiple downstream pathways, which together are important for the proliferation, survival, migration, and adhesion of mast cells (3Ronnstrand L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2535-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Upon SCF binding, Kit becomes dimerized and activated. Activated Kit transphosphorylates tyrosine (Y) residues in the receptor cytoplasmic tail, creating docking sites for various SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules. Among the various tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of Kit, Tyr719, and Tyr567 are critical for transmitting Kit signals (4Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P.

Importantly, activation of SFK from Tyr567 and activation of PI3K from Tyr719 both contribute to proliferation and survival of mast cells in vitro.

Coadwell W.J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). PI3K via activation of Rac also mediates SCF-evoked mast cell migration (18Tan B.L. Yazicioglu M.N. Ingram D. McCarthy J. Borneo J. Williams D.A. Kapur R. Blood. 2003; 101: 4725-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear what molecule mediates the activation of Rac by SFK from Kit Tyr567. Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder-2) is a member of Gab/Dos subfamily of scaffolding adapters that also include mammalian Gab1 and Gab3, Drosophila DOS (daughter of sevenless), and Caenorhabditis elegans Soc-1 (19Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Like other Gab/DOS family members, Gab2 contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, several proline-rich motifs (PXXP), and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites (19Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Gab2 PH domain preferentially binds PI 3,4,5-P3 (PIP3) (20Yu M. Lowell C.A. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two of the proline-rich motifs in Gab2 are Grb2-SH3 domain binding sites (21Lock L.S. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31536-31545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and are important for coupling Gab2 to upstream receptors through the Shc·Grb2 complex (22Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7109-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Gab2 plays an important role in transmitting signals downstream of receptors for several cytokines and growth factors as well as multichain immune receptors. Upon receptor activation, Gab2 becomes tyrosyl-phosphorylated and recruits SH2 domain containing signal relay molecules, including the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 and p85, the regulatory subunit of Class 1A PI3K. Gab2 association with Shp-2 is important for cytokine induced immediate early gene expression (23Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and growth factor-induced Erk activation (24Liu Y. Jenkins B. Shin J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol.

Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that Shp-2 via Gab/Dos is required for activation of the Ras/Erk pathway (28Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). However, the critical Shp-2 substrate in controlling Ras/Erk activation is still not clear. Gab2 association with p85 is critical for cytokine, Fc-receptor, and growth factor-evoked PI3K activation (19Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 29Mao Y. Lee A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The in vivo functions of Gab2 have been elucidated through the analysis of Gab2 knock-out (–/–) mice. Gab2 is essential for allergic responses and is reportedly important for RANK-mediated osteoclastogenesis (30Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.-P. Neel B.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Wada T. Nakashima T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Gasser J. Hara H. Schett G. Penninger J.M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have found that Gab2–/– mice have selective loss of mast cells in certain tissues such as peritoneal cavity and stomach (30Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.-P. Neel B.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 32Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because Kit is essential for mast development in vivo, these data strongly suggest that Gab2 mediates Kit regulated mast cell development. Consistent with this idea, SCF-evoked proliferation is reduced in Gab2–/– mast cells in vitro (32Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Gab2 participates in Kit-evoked mast cell proliferation is still not clear. In this study, we provide evidence that the scaffolding adapter Gab2 via Shp-2 mediates signal from Kit Tyr567 in an SFK-dependent manner to activate the Rac/JNK pathway that is important for the Kit-regulated proliferation. The KitY567-Gab2 pathway is likely to be critical for mast cell development in specific tissues in vivo. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-Gab2 antibodies were generated as described (23Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Anti-Akt1/2, -Erk2, -JNK1, -Lyn, -Kit, and -Shp-2 rabbit antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-Erk1/2, and phospho-JNK (G9) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and anti-Ras antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Rac-1 mouse monoclonal and anti-Shc rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-p85 rabbit serum was kindly provided by Dr. Lewis Cantley (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). Tamoxifen was purchased from Sigma, U0126 was from Calbiochem, and LY 294002 was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Plasmid Constructs—The HA-Gab2 WT and Gab2-ΔShp-2 fragments, released by restriction enzyme digestion from pBluescript (23Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), were cloned into the retroviral vector pMXs-puro (a gift from T. Kitomura, Tokyo University). The GST-RBD (Rac Binding Domain of PAK1) plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. C. Carpenter (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, BIDMC, Boston). Mice and Cell Cultures—Gab2–/– mice (sv129/J × C57BL/6J background) (30Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.-P. Neel B.G.

Tajima Y. Soares V. Angeles M. Whitlow S.R. Manova K. Besmer P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) were described previously. To generate compound mutants, Gab2+/– mice were crossed with Kit +/Y719F mice to generate Kit +/Y719F + Gab2+/– double heterozygous mice, which were interbred to generate KitY719F/Y719F + Gab2–/– mice. Shp-2 floxed/floxed (fl/fl) mice (33Yang W. Klaman L.D. Chen B. Araki T. Harada H. Thomas S.M. George E.L. Neel B.G. Dev Cell. 2006; 10: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were mated with ERCre™ mice (34Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) to generate Shp-2 fl/fl-ERCre™ (C57BL/6J) mice. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) were cultured as described previously (35Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, BM from 2–4-month old WT mice and littermates with the indicated genotypes were incubated in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 ng/ml of recombinant murine IL-3 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). After 4 weeks, such cultures consist of ∼95% mast cells, as indicated by surface expression of FcϵRI and Kit. 4–6 week-old BMMC cultures were used for all studies. For cell stimulation, BMMC were washed, starved in IMDM + 1% bovine serum albumin for 4–6 h at 37 °C, and resuspended in modified Tyrodes buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5.6 g/liter glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) before stimulation with the indicated concentrations of SCF (PeproTech). In some experiments, BMMC were pre-treated with 5 μm of SU6656 (Calbiochem), a specific inhibitor of SFK, for 1 h before SCF stimulation. BaF3 cells expressing similar levels of WT mouse Kit and Kit mutants (Y567F, Y569F, Y702F, and Y719F) (13Ueda S. Mizuki M. Ikeda H. Tsujimura T. Matsumura I. Nakano K. Daino H. Honda Zi Z. Sonoyama J. Shibayama H. Sugahara H. Machii T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2002; 99: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1 ng/ml of recombinant murine IL-3. The MC/9 murine mast cells expressing HA-Gab2 WT or ΔGrb2 (a mutant of Gab2 that cannot bind Grb2) (20Yu M. Lowell C.A. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 5% T-Stim supplement (BD Biosciences), 0.1 mm NEAA, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described previously (22Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7109-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and developed by enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of bands in Western blots were quantified by densitometry analysis using NIH Image 1.63F software. Flow Cytometric Analysis BMMC—(2 × 105) were prebound with anti-DNP IgE, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% FBS, and stained with FITC-conjugated rat monoclonal anti-mouse IgE antibody R35–72 (IgG1) or FITC-rat monoclonal IgG1 as control. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). To measure surface Kit expression, BMMC were stained with FITC-rat monoclonal anti-CD117 or FITC-isotype control antibodies. All these FITC-conjugated antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays—BMMC proliferation assays were performed as described (8Kissel H. Timokhina I. Hardy M.P. Rothschild G. Tajima Y. Soares V. Angeles M. Whitlow S.R. Manova K. Besmer P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells were starved without cytokine in IMDM + 10% FBS for 12–14 h, and plated in triplicate in 96-well plates in the presence of the indicated concentrations of growth factors for 24–30 h. [3H]thymidine (1 μCi) was added to each well for 4–6 h, cells were collected using a Cell Harvester (Skatron, Sterling, VA), and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined using a Beta Plate Liquid Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For quantifying apoptosis, cells were stained with FITC-Annexin V (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Retroviral Infection—of BMMC PMXs-puro retroviral plasmids were transfected into the ecotrophic packaging line Plate-E (36Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Virus-containing culture supernatants were collected 2-days later. BM cells cultured in IL-3-containing IMDM medium for 12 days were spin-infected (2500 rpm, 90 min) with pMXs-puro virus supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene, and then incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Infected cells were selected in the presence of 1 μg/ml of puromycin for 10–12 days, and then cultured in the absence of puromycin for ∼4 weeks. Rac, Ras Activation, and JNK Kinase Assays—Rac-GTP pull-down assay was performed as described (37Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The GST-RBD (the Rac Binding Domain in PAK1) fusion protein was purified on the day of the assay. Cells (107) were lysed in 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and incubated with GST-RBD (∼50 μg) at 4 °C for 40 min. Bound proteins were washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with Rac-1 antibodies. JNK kinase assays were performed as described (8Kissel H. Timokhina I. Hardy M.P. Rothschild G. Tajima Y. Soares V. Angeles M. Whitlow S.R. Manova K. Besmer P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Cells (107) were lysed in 1%Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 antibodies. Immune complexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun-(1–135) (38Shifrin V.I. Davis R.J. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2957-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as the substrate in the presence of 25 μm ATP and 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to X-Omat film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ras-GTP pull-down assay was performed as described (39Barnard D. Diaz B. Clawson D. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Analysis of Tissue Mast Cells—Back skins and ears from WT, Kit Y719F/Y719F, Gab2–/–, KitY719F/Y719F+Gab2–/– mice (2–5-month old) were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (5 μm). Mast cells were visualized by staining tissue sections with toluidine blue (Histology core facility at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center), and counted under a microscope. Data were presented as the total number of mast cells per 1-cm tissue with similar thickness. Hypodermis of the back skin consists of the fat cells and smooth muscle cells underneath the dermis. Statistical Analysis—Paired data were evaluated by two-tailed Student's t test. Comparisons of multiple groups were performed using two-way ANONA. Gab2 Is Required for Optimal Kit-initiated BMMC Proliferation—Previously, we and others (30Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.-P. Neel B.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 32Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported that mast cell numbers are decreased in certain tissues in Gab2–/– mice. Most strikingly, there was >95% decrease of mast cells in the peritoneal cavity and stomach of Gab2–/– mice. These data suggested that Gab2 plays an important role in the growth and development of mast cells in vivo, which is controlled by Kitinitiated signals. To begin to address this question, we cultured BMMC from Gab2+/+ and Gab2–/– mice (see “Experimental Procedures”). Flow cytometric analysis showed that Gab2+/+ and Gab2–/– BMMC have similar cell surface expression of Kit (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a previous report (32Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and the role of Gab2 in IL-3 signaling (22Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7109-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), IL-3 evoked proliferation was lower in Gab2–/– BMMC compared with Gab2+/+ BMMC (data not shown). Importantly, we found that SCF-evoked cell proliferation also was impaired in Gab2–/– BMMC (Fig. 1B), as reported (32Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We also analyzed cell death by apoptosis by Annexin-V staining, and found that loss of Gab2 had little effect on apoptosis of BMMC in the presence of SCF (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Gab2 regulates SCF-evoked cell cycle progression in BMMC. Kit Tyr567 Signaling to Gab2 Depends on SFK Activity—To begin to address how Gab2 mediates SCF-evoked proliferation in mast cells, we first asked whether Gab2 forms a complex with Kit upon SCF stimulation. Gab2 was immunoprecipitated from starved and SCF-stimulated WT BMMC lysates, and subjected to immunoblotting with several antibodies (Fig. 2A). Consistent with a previous report (32Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), Gab2 became tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to SCF stimulation. We also found that Gab2 associated with Kit, Shp-2, and p85 (Fig. 2A). To examine how Kit signals to Gab2, we analyzed Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in BaF3 cells (Kit-negative) reconstituted with WT Kit and the Kit mutants Y567F, Y569F, Y702F, and Y719F. These BaF3 cells express similar levels of WT and mutant Kit, as described previously (13Ueda S. Mizuki M. Ikeda H. Tsujimura T. Matsumura I. Nakano K. Daino H. Honda Zi Z. Sonoyama J. Shibayama H. Sugahara H. Machii T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2002; 99: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Upon SCF stimulation, Gab2 was robustly tyrosyl-phosphorylated (Fig. 2B) and associated with tyrosyl-phosphorylated Kit (data not shown) in Kit WT cells (Fig. 2B), as well as in cells expressing Kit Y569F, Y702F, and Y719F. In marked contrast, Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) and its association with tyrosyl phosphorylated Kit (data not shown) were inhibited in Kit Y567F cells (Fig. 2B) although residual Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation could be seen in Kit Y567F cells after longer exposure (data not shown). Loss of SCF-evoked Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation is not because of the defective kinase activity of the Kit 567F mutant since we found that SCF-evoked Kit 567F autophosphorylation and proliferation of Baf3 Kit 567F cells were not impaired compared with Kit WT (13Ueda S. Mizuki M. Ikeda H. Tsujimura T. Matsumura I. Nakano K. Daino H. Honda Zi Z. Sonoyama J. Shibayama H. Sugahara H. Machii T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2002; 99: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This result indicates that Tyr567 is required for SCF-evoked Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Kit Tyr567 is primarily thought to recruit and activate SFK, although reports suggested that it also recruits Shp-2 (11Kozlowski M. Larose L. Lee F. Le D.M. Rottapel R. Siminovitch K.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2089-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and Shc (12Price D.J. Rivnay B. Fu Y. Jiang S. Avraham S. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Gab2 is recruited to Kit via Shp-2 or Shc. To distinguish these possibilities, SCF-evoked Shp-2 and Shc tyrosyl phosphorylation were examined in Gab2+/+ and Gab2–/– BMMC. Although Shp-2 became tyrosyl phosphorylated in Gab2+/+ BMMC, its phosphorylation was lost in Gab2–/– BMMC, indicating that Gab2 is required for SCF-evoked Shp-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 2C)"

Here we show that these transporters are expressed in the apical membrane of the proximal tubular cells in mouse kidney, indicating that these transporters are likely to mediate the first step in the renal reabsorption of lactate. Interestingly, the renal expression of both transporters is almost completely ablated in mice homozygous for the deletion of the transcription factor c/ebpδ. This effect is tissue-specific since the expression of the transporters is not affected in non-renal tissues. The functional role of C/EBPδ in the expression of SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 is demonstrable in HEK293 cells in reporter assays using gene-specific promoters. The ablation of the transporters in the kidney is accompanied by a marked increase in urinary excretion of lactate as well as a decrease in blood levels of lactate in c/ebpδ–/– mice. These data provide evidence for an obligatory role for slc5a8 and slc5a12 in the renal absorption of lactate. In addition, we show that urinary excretion of urate is significantly elevated in c/ebpδ–/– mice even though the expression of URAT1, the transporter responsible for the apical membrane uptake of urate in renal proximal tubule, is not altered. These data provide in vivo evidence for the functional coupling between lactate reabsorption and urate reabsorption in the kidney. Thus, the fortuitous double knock-out of slc5a8 and slc5a12 in kidney in c/ebpδ–/– mice reveals the physiologic role of these transporters in the renal handling of lactate and urate. slc5a8 and slc5a12 represent the high affinity and low affinity Na+/lactate co-transporters, respectively, in the kidney.

Lactate is the product of glucose metabolism under anerobic conditions and is also the sole end product of glucose metabolism in erythrocytes. Normal levels of lactate in blood are significant (∼1.5 mm). Lactate is an important precursor for gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney and also plays a vital role in the maintenance of brain function (1Brooks G.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 258-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pellerin L. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 32: 59-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This process involves two different Na+-coupled transport systems in the apical membrane and a Na+-independent transport system in the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubular cells (4Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 987-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The basolateral membrane transport system is mediated by MCT1, a monocarboxylate transporter. The molecular identities of the apical membrane transport systems remain unknown. Recently, we isolated two transporter clones from a mouse kidney cDNA library which function as Na+-coupled transporters for lactate, SMCT1 (slc5a8) as the high affinity transporter (5Gopal E.

The only known renal phenotype reported in these mice is the altered myofibroblast transdifferentiation in an experimental model of glomerulonephritis (15Takeji M. Kawada N. Moriyama T. Nagatoya K. Oseto S. Akira S. Hori M. Imai E. Miwa T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SLC5A8 was originally identified as a putative tumor suppressor in colon (16Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the expression of SLC5A8 has been shown to be down-regulated not only in colon cancer but also in cancers of various other tissues (reviewed in Refs. 17Ganapathy V. Gopal E. Miyauchi S. Prasad P.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and 18Gupta N. Martin P.M. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 2419-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the expression of SLC5A8 are not well understood. A search for transcription factor binding sites in SLC5A8 promoter revealed the presence of consensus sequences for the binding of C/EBPδ. Since SLC5A8 is expressed most abundantly in the kidney, we investigated the potential role of this transcription factor in the renal expression and function of slc5a8 using c/ebpδ null mice. These studies led to the surprising finding that not only slc5a8 but also its close functional relative slc5a12 are down-regulated in the kidneys of c/ebpδ null mice. The fortuitous double knock-out of slc5a8 and slc5a12 in the kidneys of these mice helped us determine the physiologic role of these two transporters in the renal absorption of lactate. Animals—Adult male wild type, c/ebpδ+/–, and c/ebpδ–/– mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Collection of Blood and Urine Samples—Mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane and urine was collected from bladder and blood was collected from cardiac puncture. Urine was centrifuged, and clear supernatant was frozen immediately for later use in lactate and uric acid measurements. Blood collected in glass tubes was allowed to clot and serum was separated by centrifugation. Serum was also frozen immediately for later use in lactate and uric acid measurements. Urine and serum samples from each mouse were treated individually for measurements of lactate and uric acid (wild type, n = 7; heterozygous, n = 5; homozygous, n = 8). Measurements of Lactate and Uric Acid—Lactate levels in urine and serum samples were measured using a commercially available kit (Lactate Assay Kit; Biomedical Research Service Center, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY). Uric acid levels in urine and serum samples were also measured using a commercially available kit (uric acid assay kit; BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA). RT 2The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.-PCR—RNA was isolated from whole kidney, colon, jejunum, ileum, and brain collected from wild type, c/ebpδ+/–, and c/ebpδ–/– mice and used for RT-PCR to determine the steady-state levels of mRNAs for various transporters. PCR primers were designed based on the sequence information available in GenBank™ for mouse cDNAs for these transporters. Immunofluorescence Localization—Antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides specific for mouse slc5a8 and slc5a12. The sequences of the antigenic peptides were ELNFTDHSGKINGTRL for slc5a8 (the last 16 amino acids of the C-terminal tail) and CGVQHDRETEQDYLD for slc5a12 (amino acids 559–573). The antibodies were affinity-purified against immobilized antigenic peptides before use in immunofluorescence studies. The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed by immunoreactivity with cloned mouse slc5a8 and mouse slc5a12, which were expressed heterologously in HRPE cells (a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line). Anti-c/ebpδ antibody, raised in rabbits, and the antibody specific for 4F2hc (the heavy chain of the 4F2 antigen, also known as CD98), raised in goat, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). This allowed us to perform double labeling studies with slc5a8 and 4F2hc or with slc5a12 and 4F2hc using appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (slc5a8 or slc5a12, red fluorophore; 4F2hc, green fluorophore). 4F2hc is a marker for basolateral membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells (19Palacin M. Kanai Y. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Tissue sections were prepared from kidneys collected from wild type and c/ebpδ–/– mice and used for immunolocalization by methods described in our earlier publications (20Dun Y. Mysona B. Van Ells T. Amarnath L. Ola M. Ganapathy V. Smith S.B. Cell Tissue Res. 2006; 324: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Martin P.M. Gopal E. Ananth S. Zhuang L. Itagaki S. Prasad B.M. Smith S.B.

Generation of SLC5A8- and SLC5A12-specific Promoter-Reporter Constructs—The cDNAs for human C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The human SLC5A8 promoter-EGFP and SLC5A8 promoter-luciferase constructs were generated by first subcloning the 2.4-kb SLC5A8 promoter (obtained by PCR using human genomic DNA as the template) into the TOPO-cloning vector and then using the HindIII/EcoRI-digested insert to clone into pUIIR3-EGFP and pUBT-luc vectors. The primers used for PCR were: 5′-CTCGACTAAGAAATGCCAGAAGACAACAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGCTTGGCCGCACGGTCGCCTGAGC-3′ (antisense). Similarly, human SL-C5A12 promoter-luciferase and SLC5A12 promoter-EGFP constructs were generated by first subcloning the 2.0-kb SLC5A12 promoter (obtained by PCR using human genomic DNA as the template) into pGEM-T Easy vector and then cloning the HindIII/PstI-digested promoter insert into pUBT-luc vector and the HindIII/XhoI-digested promoter insert into pUIIR3-EGFP vector. The primers used for PCR were: 5′-AACCATCAGTACTCATTAACTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGTTTCTTTCAACGAGGTC-3′ (antisense). For the transactivation assays, HEK293 cells were seeded (2 × 105 cells) in 35-mm tissue-culture dishes and allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The effector and reporter plasmids were transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression was monitored by epifluorescence after 36 h post-transfection under the fluorescence microscope. With the luciferase reporter, cells were collected after 36 h transfection, and the lysates were used for measurement of luciferase activity. The activity was normalized for protein levels and compared with vector-transfected cells. We first compared the renal expression of slc5a8 and slc5a12 between c/ebpδ+/+ and c/ebpδ–/– mice by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Kidneys from wild type mice (n = 7) expressed slc5a8 mRNA and slc5a12 mRNA, whereas these mRNAs were almost undetectable in kidneys from c/ebpδ–/– mice (n = 8). In heterozygous mice (c/ebpδ+/–)(n = 5), the mRNAs were detectable, but the levels were markedly reduced compared with those in wild type mice, indicating a dose-response relationship between c/ebpδ levels and slc5a8 and slc5a12 mRNA levels in kidney. In contrast, the levels of mRNAs for many other transporters (MCT1, a H+-coupled monocarboxylate transporter; URAT1, an anion exchanger responsible for the first step in the renal absorption of uric acid; OAT1, an anion exchanger; NaDC3, a Na+-coupled transporter for dicarboxylates) were comparable between wild type mice and knock-out mice (n = 4 for each genotype) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, there were no changes in the expression of slc5a8 and slc5a12 in non-renal tissues such as the brain and intestinal tract in c/ebpδ–/– mice compared with wild type mice (n = 2 for each genotype) (Fig. 1C). The changes in mRNA levels for the two transporters in kidney paralleled with the expression of corresponding proteins (Fig. 1D). In kidneys from wild type mice, slc5a8 and slc5a12 (red fluorescence) were found to localize to the apical membrane of proximal tubules as evident from the lack of co-localization with 4F2hc (green fluorescence), a marker for basolateral membrane in renal epithelial cells. The expression of slc5a12 in the kidney was more abundant, and detectable in more proximal tubule sections than slc5a8. In c/ebpδ–/– mice, the expression of both transporters was markedly reduced. We also examined the expression of c/ebpδ in these kidney sections, confirming the expression of the transcription factor protein in wild type mouse kidneys and its absence in c/ebpδ–/– mouse kidneys. Taken collectively, these studies show that c/ebpδ controls the expression of slc5a8 and slc5a12 in the kidney. The in vivo findings that c/ebpδ controls the renal expression of slc5a8 and slc5a12 were confirmed by two different reporter assays (luciferase and EGFP) using promoter constructs of human SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 (Fig. 2, A–D). In the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, expression of C/EBPδ induced the reporter activity with both gene-specific promoters (n = 3; p < 0.05). This effect was specific for C/EBPδ as the other two members of the family, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, had no effect in these reporter assays. The expression of these transcription factor proteins in cells transfected with respective clones have been confirmed by immunodetection with appropriate antibodies (data not shown). The apical membrane localization of slc5a8 and slc5a12 suggests that these two transporters are likely to mediate the first step in the active reabsorption of lactate. The lack of expression of these two transporters in c/ebpδ–/– mouse kidneys suggests that lactate reabsorption is likely to be severely impaired in these mice. To test this hypothesis, we determined lactate levels in urine and serum samples collected from c/ebpδ+/+, c/ebpδ+/–, and c/ebpδ–/– mice. Urinary lactate levels were low in wild type mice (48 ± 9 nmol/ml), but the levels increased 4-fold in heterozygous mice (p < 0.05) and 29-fold in homozygous mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). This was accompanied by a parallel decrease in the serum levels of lactate. The serum level of lactate in wild type mice was 1.02 ± 0.06 mm. The level decreased 78% in heterozygous mice (p < 0.05) and 90% in homozygous mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). There is strong evidence for a functional coupling between lactate reabsorption and urate reabsorption in the kidney in vivo (22Hediger M.A. Johnson R.J. Miyazaki H. Endou H. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This suggests that impairment in renal lactate reabsorption would lead to defective reasbsortion of urate. This was indeed the case in c/ebpδ–/– mice. Urinary excretion of urate increased 2.5-fold in heterozygous mice (p < 0.05) and 6-fold in homozygous mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the serum levels of urate in homozygous mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3D). The serum levels of urate were not significantly different between wild type and heterozygous mice (p > 0.05). These data confirm the functional coupling between renal reabsorption of lactate via slc5a8/slc5a12 and renal reabsorption of urate via URAT1. slc5a8 and slc5a12 mediate active influx of lactate into proximal tubular cells and intracellular lactate in turn serves as the exchangeable anion for URAT1 (an anion exchanger), thus facilitating the reabsorption of urate (Fig. 3E). The lack of expression of slc5a8 and slc5a12 in c/ebpδ–/– mouse kidneys therefore leads to defective reabsorption of urate despite the normal expression of URAT1. It has to be noted that there may be additional isoforms of monocarboxylate transporters in the basolateral membrane of renal tubular cells, which work along with MCT1 in the renal handling of lactate. Similarly, the molecular identity of the transporter responsible for the transfer of uric acid across the basolateral membrane has not been established. We do not know if the expression of any of these transporters is affected in c/ebpδ null mouse kidneys. The first step in the renal absorption of lactate and urate occurs at the apical membrane of the renal tubular cells and the present studies focused on the transporters, which play a critical role at this step. These studies establish slc5a8 and slc5a12 as the Na+-coupled transporters responsible for the first step in the renal reabsorption of lactate, namely the uptake across the apical membrane of the proximal tubular cells. Though the relative importance of each of these transporters in the renal absorption of lactate cannot be assessed from the present studies, the two transporters together are obligatory for this important renal function. In addition, these studies demonstrate that C/EBPδ is a critical regulator of the expression of these two transporters in the kidney. The control of their expression by c/ebpδ seems to be kidney-specific as there is no detectable change in non-renal tissues such as the intestinal tract and brain. These studies also provide unequivocal evidence for the coupling between lactate reabsorption and urate reabsorption in the kidney in vivo. Lactate is an important gluconeogenic substrate and the principal component of the Cori cycle, which links glycolysis in skeletal muscle and gluconeogenesis in the liver. Lactate is also the preferred energy substrate for neurons in the brain and retina (2Pellerin L. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 32: 59-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the conservation of lactate by the kidney via reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate is critical for the maintenance of energy homeostatis not only in the skeletal muscle but also in the central nervous system. c/ebpδ–/– mice as a model for the kidney-specific double knock-out of slc5a8 and slc5a12 would be useful in future studies to investigate the biological role of lactate under physiological and pathological conditions."

We have previously shown that ezrin is regulated by androgen in rat prostate and that its expression is increased in prostate cancer and in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. We have used the androgen-sensitive cell line LNCaP-FGC to investigate the role of ezrin in androgen-induced cell invasion. We found that androgen treatment of LNCaP-FGC cells induces ezrin expression, an effect that is inhibited by the androgen receptor antagonist, bicalutamide. In addition, androgen treatment induces the phosphorylation of ezrin in Thr-567 and Tyr-353 in a sequential manner. This is mediated through protein kinase C α and Src tyrosine kinase, respectively. Androgen treatment induces the translocation of both protein kinase C α and ezrin to the cell membrane and their association. Inhibition of ezrin function using short interference RNA or the overexpression of T567A and Y353F-ezrin mutants significantly reduces androgen-induced Matrigel invasion but does not affect cell proliferation or cell adhesion. Matrigel invasion of the androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP-R is also dependent on ezrin.

Androgen ablation therapy in its many modalities has been a mainstay in the treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma. In general, androgen deprivation induces remission in 80-90% of men with advanced PCa and results in a median progression-free survival of 12-33 months. This period is usually followed by the emergence of an androgen-independent PCa resulting in a median overall survival of 23-37 months. In metastatic PCa disease, androgen ablation is also the first line of treatment. Androgen ablation in combination with external beam radiotherapy or prostatectomy delays disease progression and results in significant survival advantage when compared with radiation therapy or prostatectomy alone (5Bolla M.

One hypothesis is that some of the mechanisms that are normally under androgen control become constitutively active in androgen-independent cells. This is supported by findings showing that one third of hormone refractory carcinomas contain an amplification of the androgen receptor (AR) gene (12Visakorpi T. Hyytinen E. Koivisto P. Tanner M.

Upton M. Rajeshkumar B. Balk S.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2511-2515PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility is that androgen-independent mechanisms are responsible for the phenotypic features of androgen-resistant PCa cells (10Edwards J. Bartlett J.M. BJU Int. 2005; 95: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Most likely, both androgen-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in PCa progression. Despite clinical evidence indicating that androgen influences the metastatic behavior of prostate epithelial cells, our knowledge regarding how these effects are exerted remains limited. In a recent study, we have identified several novel androgen-regulated genes, some of which may be of importance in the regulation of prostate cell invasiveness (15Pang S.T. Dillner K. Wu X. Pousette A. Norstedt G. Flores-Morales A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4897-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have shown that ezrin expression is repressed by castration and stimulated by androgen replacement in rat ventral prostate epithelial cells. Ezrin is a linker protein with capacity to bind membrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction provides an intracellular scaffold for the formation of specialized membrane domains that facilitate signal transduction through a number of growth factor receptor and adhesion molecules (16Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).

We have recently shown that immunoreactive ezrin content measured in radical prostatectomy samples is increased both in PCa and in high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, a pre-cancerous lesion (21Pang S.T.

Its levels correlate with adverse prognostic factors such as Gleason score and invasion of seminal vesicles (22Valdman A. Fang X. Pang S.T. Nilsson B. Ekman P. Egevad L. Eur. Urol. 2005; 48: 852-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we have used the hormone-sensitive cell line LNCaP-FGC to study the role of ezrin in androgen-induced cell invasion. We have also explored the mechanisms whereby androgen regulates ezrin function in PCa cells. Materials—Synthetic androgen R1881 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide (Casodex) was a generous donation from AstraZeneca (Stockholm, Sweden). LY294002 was obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Y27632, calphostin C, and Gö6976, PP2, and Neomycin were obtained from Calbiochem. U0126 was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Culture, Hormone, and Drug Treatments—PCa cell lines LNCaP-FGC and PC3 were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LNCaP-R cells have previously been described (23Hasenson M. Hartley-Asp B. Kihlfors C. Lundin A. Gustafsson J.A. Pousette A. Prostate. 1985; 7: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were maintained as previously described (24Pang S.T. Flores-Morales A. Skoog L. Chuan Y.C. Nordstedt G. Pousette A. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 11: 1187-1192PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bonaccorsi L.

For the experiments, cells were subcultured in 60 mm culture for 24-48 h before the medium was substituted with phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% Dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Inc., Logan, UT) for 24 h prior to exposure to the same medium containing 0.1% ethanol (control) or 10 nm synthetic testosterone R1881. Bicalutamide (10 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), neomycin (10 μm), U0126 (10 μm), Y27632 (20 μm), Gö6976 (1 μm), PP2 (10 μm), and calphostin C (0.5 μm) were added to the cells for 2 h prior to hormone stimulation. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added 30 min prior to hormone stimulation. Mutagenesis and Cell Transfection—An expression construct with VSV-G-tagged human wild-type ezrin (WT-ezrin) and the Y353F-ezrin mutant are a kind gift from Dr. Monique Arpin (26Srivastava J. Elliott B.E. Louvard D. Arpin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mutant T567A-ezrin was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions and using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGGACAAGTACAAGGCGCTGCGGCAGATC-3 and 5′-GATCTGCCGCAGCGCCTTGTAC-TTGTCCC-3′. The insertion of the T567A-ezrin mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Short interference RNA (siRNA) targeting human ezrin and control siRNA targeting luciferase were obtained from Qiagen. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106/60-mm dish in 2 ml of RPMI1640 medium 1 day before transfection. Transfection of ezrin expression constructs and siRNAs was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated after 24 h. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (5 μg) from different samples were first treated with DNase I (Promega) and then reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 20 μl. The synthesized cDNA was used to measure the ezrin expression by real-time PCR (DNA Engine Opticon 2; MJ Research, Inc.). The reactions were performed in 20 μl with 1 μl of the respective cDNA sample and 0.4 μm primers. SYBR Green I dye, hot-start iTaq DNA polymerase, buffer, and dNTPs were supplied in the iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). For each studied gene, a relative standard curve was constructed with serial dilutions using a pool of all cDNA samples. All the measurements were performed in triplicate for each sample and normalized to the internal control gene, β-actin. Four independent experiments were performed. The primers used were β-actin, 5′-CTGGCTGCTGACCGAGG-3′ and 5′-GAAGGTCTCAAACATGATCTGGGT-3; ezrin, 5′-ACGTCTGAGAATCAACAAGC-3′ and 5′-TTCTCCTCATAGTCCTGCAG-3′. The annealing temperature was 58 °C. Western Blotting—LNCaP-FGC cells were cultivated and treated as described above. The cells were harvested using radioimmune precipitation buffer with protease inhibitors, and protein concentration was determined with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein extracts were denatured, separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen), and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then blocked in a Tris-buffered saline solution with 5% bovine serum albumin or 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with primary antibody. The membranes were further probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse/antirabbit to visualize the specific band. Mouse monoclonal antihuman ezrin antibody was obtained from Neomarker, rabbit anti-human phospho-ezrin (Thr-567) and phospho-ezrin (Tyr-353) were from Cell Signaling Technologies, monoclonal PKCα antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse anti-VSV-G antibody was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Mouse monoclonal anti-active Src (Tyr-529) and Src antibodies were obtained from BIOSOURCE. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations of cell extracts were performed by incubating lysates with anti-VSV-G antibody. The reaction mixture was gently rocked at 4 °C overnight. Protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) was used to absorb immunocomplexes that were washed extensively with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The pellet was resuspended in loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to Western blotting. PKCα Translocation—LNCaP-FGC cells were cultivated as described above and treated with R1881 for the times indicated in Fig. 7. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation, and homogenized by sonication in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Cytosolic and particulate fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation (30 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C). Proteins from the particulate fraction were extracted by incubation in buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 45 min at 4 °C and subsequent sonication for 1 min. PKCα translocation was detected by Western blot. Matrigel Invasive Assay—Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences and stored at -20°. After thawing at 4 °C overnight, the Matrigel was diluted in serum-free RPMI1640 medium. 50 μl of the suspension were evenly inoculated onto the upper chamber of a 6.5-mm transwell membrane and allowed to form a gel at 37 °C. The Matrigel invasive assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 0.2-ml aliquot containing 200,000 cells was seeded on the upper chamber of the Matrigel-coated transwell filter (8 μm pore). The Dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum-containing medium was added to the lower chamber and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Noninvading cells that remained on the upper surface of the filter were removed with cotton wool; the cells that appeared on the lower surface of the filter were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, stained with hematoxylin, and counted under a microscope. Four independent experiments were performed. In each experiment Matrigel invasion for each experimental group was measured in triplicate. Matrigel Adhesion Assay—Matrigel adhesion assay was performed as described (27Zhang M. Altuwaijri S. Yeh S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with some modifications. LNCaP-FGC cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing 0.1% ethanol or 10 nm R1881. The cell suspension (2.5 × 105 cells in 0.5 ml of medium/well) was added to 24 wells precoated with Matrigel and allowed to attach by incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. Unattached cells were removed by repeated washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Attached cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 10 min. After washing with water, the stained cells were extracted with 0.25 ml of 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance of the dye extract was measured at 590 nm. Cell Proliferation Assays—The cell number was assessed indirectly by staining with crystal violet dye. LNCaP-FGC cells were seeded in 96-well plates (density 5,000 cells/well) in 5% Dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum phenol red-free RPMI 1640 and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with 10 nm R1881. After incubation, the medium was removed and cells were gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and stained with crystal violet (0.1% w/v in ddH2O). The excess dye was carefully washed away with ddH2O. The stained cells were lysed with 0.1% acetic acid. The absorbance was measured at 590 nm. Immunohistochemistry—The prostate samples were obtained from patients who had prostate biopsy for cancer diagnosis and subsequently received radical prostatectomy. All patients were subjected to 1-2 weeks of neoadjuvant hormone therapy with cyproterone acetate prior to the prostatectomy. The immunohistochemistry experimental procedure was carried by standard biotin-avidin complex method as previously described (21Pang S.T. Fang X. Valdman A. Norstedt G. Pousette A. Egevad L. Ekman P. Urology. 2004; 63: 609-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons between groups were made by analysis of variance followed by Fisher's post-hoc test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Androgen Regulates Ezrin Expression in Human PCa Cells—Our previous findings suggest that ezrin may have a regulatory role on androgen actions in prostate epithelial cells (15Pang S.T. Dillner K. Wu X. Pousette A. Norstedt G. Flores-Morales A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4897-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Pang S.T. Fang X. Valdman A. Norstedt G. Pousette A. Egevad L. Ekman P. Urology. 2004; 63: 609-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To explore this hypothesis, we first studied whether androgen directly regulates ezrin expression in human PCa cells. The androgen-responsive cell line LNCaP-FGC was used to measure gene expression changes after androgen treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with the synthetic androgen R1881 increases ezrin mRNA levels. This effect was first evident after 2 h of treatment and was sustained for at least 20 h. R1881 effects were blocked by pretreatment with the androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide (9Schellhammer P. Sharifi R. Block N. Soloway M. Venner P. Patterson A.L. Sarosdy M. Vogelzang N. Jones J. Kolvenbag G. Urology. 1995; 45: 745-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), indicating that the androgen-stimulatory effect requires the actions of the AR. Treatment with cycloheximide for 30 min before androgen stimulation blocked the induction of ezrin expression, indicating that androgen effects are indirect and dependent on de novo produced androgen-regulated genes (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of whole cell protein extracts showed that ezrin levels are increased after androgen treatment in a manner that corresponds to the changes seen in mRNA levels (Fig. 2). Also in line with the gene expression measurements, androgen-induced stimulation of ezrin protein levels was inhibited by treatment with bicalutamide (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effects of androgen on ezrin protein levels. A, Western blot analysis of ezrin protein expression in LNCaP-FGC exposed to R1881 alone or in combination with bicalutamide for different time periods. The graph in the upper panel shows the -fold changes in three independent experiments. Values for the control were set to 1-fold. The lower panel shows a representative Western blot.

Each column represents the average ± S.D. of four independent replicates. * indicates statistically significant (p < 0.05) regulation after R1881 treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested whether similar effects on ezrin expression could be observed in the prostate of cancer patients subjected to androgen ablation therapy (Fig. 2B). Ezrin levels were examined by immunohistochemistry in the prostate tissue of three patients obtained from prostate biopsies before and after radical prostatectomy. The patients were all diagnosed with PCa and subjected to neoadjuvant androgen ablation therapy using cyproterone acetate. One of the biopsies was not suitable for analysis. In the other two patient samples analyzed, ezrin expression decreased in PCa cells after androgen ablation therapy. Although a proper statistical analysis was not possible due to the small number of samples, our data suggest that ezrin expression is under androgen control in human prostate. Ezrin Actions Are Necessary for Androgen-induced PCa Cell Invasion—Androgen ablation is known to reduce metastases in androgen-sensitive models of PCa (28Pfitzenmaier J. Quinn J.E. Odman A.M. Zhang J. Keller E.T. Vessella R.L. Corey E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As the regulation of cell motility by ezrin is well documented (29Martin T.A. Harrison G. Mansel R.E. Jiang W.G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2003; 46: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30Curto M. McClatchey A.I. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 113-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we next wanted to explore its role in androgen-stimulated cell invasion. A Matrigel invasion assay was used to study androgen effects. As shown in Fig. 2C, LNCaP-FGC cells have little invasive capacity in the absence of androgen. The addition of R1881 significantly increased the number of cells migrating through the Matrigel. This effect was inhibited by bicalutamide. Interestingly, bicalutamide alone also enhanced cell invasion, although moderately. Because bicalutamide treatment alone is unable to stimulate ezrin expression, it is possible that ezrin up-regulation by androgen is an epiphenomenon, not directly related to the effects of the hormone on cell invasion. To rule out this possibility, we studied the invasiveness of LNCaP-FGC cells expressing a siRNA targeting human ezrin (Fig. 3). Very low expression levels of ezrin were detected in androgen-deprived cells. Androgen treatment induces ezrin expression in control cells, an effect that was severely reduced in ezrin siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Cells expressing ezrin siRNA show a significant reduction of both basal and androgen-induced Matrigel invasion (Fig. 3B). These effects could not be explained by changes in cell adhesion, because no differences in the number of cells attached to Matrigel were detected in the presence or absence of androgen in either cells transfected with siRNA targeting ezrin or luciferase (Fig. 3C). Because ezrin, through the activation of PI(3) kinase, is involved in the regulation of kidney-derived epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1) survival (31Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), we next explored ezrin actions on LNCaP-FGC cell proliferation. As Fig. 3D shows, expression of ezrin siRNA has no significant effects on LNCaP-FGC cell proliferation. Ezrin Overexpression Is Not Sufficient to Promote PCa Cell Invasiveness—The findings that induction of cell invasion by androgen correlates with increased ezrin protein levels and that a siRNA targeting ezrin blocks this effect suggest that increasing ezrin expression could be sufficient to promote invasion. We tested this hypothesis by transiently overexpressing WT-ezrin in LNCaP-FGC cells. As shown in Fig. 4, although transfection with a VSV-G-tagged ezrin expression vector increased the proteins levels of ezrin to levels beyond those achieved upon androgen treatment (Fig. 4A), no effect on Matrigel invasion was observed in the absence of androgen treatment (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, treatment of ezrin-overexpressing cells with R1881 significantly enhanced the effects of androgen on cell invasion, suggesting that additional actions of androgen are required to activate ezrin function.FIGURE 4Effects of ezrin overexpression in LNCaP-FGC cells. A, Western blot analysis of ezrin expression in LNCaP-FGC cells transfected with VSV-G-tagged WT-ezrin or control plasmid. A representative result of four independently performed experiments is shown. B, Matrigel invasiveness of LNCaP-FGC cells transfected with VSV-G-tagged WT-ezrin or control plasmid with or without R1881 (10 nm) stimulation.

The mechanism of transfer, storage, and insertion of Moco into the appropriate apo-enzyme is poorly understood. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a Moco carrier protein (MCP) has been identified and characterized recently. Here we show biochemical evidence that MCP binds Moco as well as the tungstate-substituted form of the cofactor (Wco) with high affinity, whereas molybdopterin, the ultimate cofactor precursor, is not bound. This binding selectivity points to a specific metal-mediated interaction with MCP, which protects Moco and Wco from oxidation with t½ of 24 and 96 h, respectively.

We have determined the crystal structure of MCP at 1.6Å resolution using seleno-methionated and native protein. The monomer constitutes a Rossmann fold with two homodimers forming a symmetrical tetramer in solution.

CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2792-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This pterin molecule is also responsible for metal chelation in all tungsten-containing enzymes analyzed so far. Molybdenum enzymes are essential for diverse metabolic processes such as nitrate assimilation in autotrophs and phytohormone synthesis in plants (4Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar) or sulfur detoxification and purine catabolism in mammals (5Enemark J.H. Cosper M.M. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 621-654PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of Moco results in the pleiotropic loss of all molybdenum enzymes. Human Moco deficiency is a severe hereditary metabolic disorder (6Johnson J.L. Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Duran M. Beemer F.A. Wadman S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3715-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and affected patients die in early childhood. In all organisms studied so far, Moco is synthesized by a conserved pathway that can be divided into four major steps (3Schwarz G. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2792-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), according to the biosynthetic intermediates cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate, (formerly described as precursor Z) (7Santamaria-Araujo J.A.

In the final and most diverse step of Moco biosynthesis, a single molybdenum atom is ligated to one (in pro- and eukaryotes) or two MPT dithiolates (in prokaryotes). After completion of biosynthesis, mature cofactor has to be inserted into molybdenum enzymes. In prokaryotes, a complex of proteins synthesizing the last step(s) of Moco biosynthesis was proposed to donate the mature cofactor to apo-enzymes (8Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 7: 7Google Scholar) assisted by enzyme-specific chaperones (9Vergnes A. Gouffi-Belhabich K. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol.

In eukaryotes, no molybdenum enzyme-specific chaperone has been found until now, and direct transfer of Moco is possible at least in vitro (10Leimkuhler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in several organisms such as Escherichia coli (11Amy N.K. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 114-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plant seeds (12Kalakoutskii K.L. Fernandez E.

Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar), differences in the insertion of Moco might also be considered. Enzymes of the sulfite oxidase (SO) family are characterized by a highly conserved cysteine residue (14Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H.

In contrast, enzymes of the xanthine oxidoreductase family contain a terminal sulfide group as third sulfur ligand (16Wahl R.C. Warner C.K. Finnerty V. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3958-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so far, it is unknown at which stage of molybdenum enzyme maturation this final modification occurs (17Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Among eukaryotes, the activity of a Moco carrier protein (MCP) was described at first in the green alga C. reinhardtii (13Aguilar M. Kalakoutskii K. Cardenas J. Fernandez E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 162-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Later, by following this activity, a 16-kDa protein was purified and shown to bind and protect Moco against oxidation (18Witte C.P. Igeno M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernandez E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MCP activity was measured with the nit-1 reconstitution assay (19Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. DeVries J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is unknown whether MCP is also able to donate Moco to molybdenum enzymes other than NR. C. reinhardtii MCP forms a homotetramer in solution and is homologous to bacterial proteins with unknown function (20Ataya F.S. Witte C.P. Galvan A. Igeno M.I. Fernandez E. J. Biol.

The availability of sufficient amounts of Moco is essential for the cell to meet its changing demand of molybdenum enzymes. In contrast to the regulated Moco-dependent enzymes (e.g. plant NR), the Moco synthetic enzymes are continuously expressed at a basal level (21Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 317-368PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the existence of MCP would provide a way to buffer the supply of Moco. Here we present biochemical evidence that C. reinhardtii MCP discriminates upon binding selectively between the molybdenum-(Moco) or tungsten-containing (Wco) cofactor and MPT. MCP-bound Moco and Wco are significantly stabilized against degradation. We have determined the crystal structure of MCP at 1.6 Å, confirming the homotetrameric nature of the protein. Clustering of conserved and mobile surface residues together with in silico docking studies depicted a surface cavity as a putative Moco-binding site, which was supported by structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of MCP—CrMCP1 (20Ataya F.S. Witte C.P. Galvan A. Igeno M.I. Fernandez E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10885-10890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was PCR-cloned into BamHI and HindIII sites of pQE80 yielding pQE80-CrMCP1. To obtain MCP saturated with MPT and/or Moco, we transformed pQE80-CrMCP1 into E. coli strains RK5206 (mogA-), TP1000 (mobA-), or BL21. MCP was expressed for 36 h at 22-37 °C in LB medium containing 50 nm-10 μm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside. Co-purification of MCP with bound pterins was performed under anaerobic conditions using 1 ml of His-Trap columns (Amersham Biosciences) per 2 liters of culture. Apo-MCP was expressed in BL21 for 12 h at 37 °C using LB medium containing 500 μm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside. Seleno-methionated (Se-Met) MCP was expressed in DL41 cells (22Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) grown in defined medium containing seleno-methionine. For crystallization, apo-MCP and Se-Met MCP were purified aerobically using 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acetic fast flow resin (Qiagen) per liter of culture. Pure protein fractions were buffer-exchanged into 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl, concentrated (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience) up to 120 mg/ml, and stored in 20-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Moco and Wco Stability Studies—Purified MCP (1 nmol) loaded with Moco or Wco was incubated under aerobic condition at different temperatures, and MPT content was determined by HPLC FormA analysis (23Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Determination of MPT and Moco—Total MPT was detected by HPLC FormA analysis as described (23Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moco was determined by nit-1 reconstitution using 10 μl of protein solution and 10 μl of nit-1 crude protein extract (19Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. DeVries J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 mm reduced glutathione. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the determination of reconstituted NADPH-NR activity. Nitrite formed in a final volume of 125 μl was quantified by the absorbance at 540 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Versa max, Molecular Devices). One unit of Moco activity was defined as reconstituted nit-1 NR activity sufficient to produce an increase of 1.0 absorbance units at 540 nm per 25 min of reaction time. For kinetic studies of Moco transfer, 55-2000 fmol of Moco (bound to MCP) were used and incubated with nit-1 crude extract for 30 min to 21 h at room temperature. Reconstituted NR-activity was determined after 10 min of reaction time. Crystallization and Structure Determination—MCP crystals were obtained from 16% polyethylene glycol 4000, 150 mm sodium acetate, and 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, using hanging drop vapor diffusion. Se-Met crystals diffracted X-rays up to 2.4 Å at the synchrotron beamline BL1 at Berliner Elektronen-speicherring-Gesellschaft fuer Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY), Berlin, Germany (see Table 1, MCP1). Native crystals diffracted up to 1.6 (MCP2) and 2.3 Å (MCP3) resolution, using either synchrotron radiation ([email protected]) or a rotating anode (Rigaku R4++), respectively. Data sets were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (MCP1, MCP2) or MOS-FLM (24Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) (MCP3) and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (25Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Starting with MCP1, the substructure was solved using HYSS from the PHENIX package (26Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement using PHASER (32Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) served for solving the native structures of MCP2 and MCP3. The high resolution of MCP2 allowed using the “autobuild” function of ARP/WARP (33Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Docking Studies—Automated docking was performed using the “Darwinian Genetic Algorithm” of GOLD (version 3.0) (34Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol.

The scoring function allows us to include terms for hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and intramolecular energies. Moco was docked to the putative binding pocket of each monomer of the three MCP crystal forms with Oδ1 of Asp-93 as the flood fill center of a 20 Å docking sphere assuming one cavity. In all runs, operator weights for crossover, mutation, and migration were set to 95, 95, and 10, respectively, for a population size of 100 and a selection pressure of 1.1. The “early termination” option was selected, and the top three solutions for each docking run were analyzed. The solutions were superimposed, and their fit was evaluated regarding electrostatic characteristics as well as the shape of the surface and conservation of interacting residues. Selective Binding of Moco and Wco to MCP—To characterize the substrate binding properties, we expressed MCP in different E. coli strains that are free of MPT (BL21) (10Leimkuhler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or accumulate MPT (RK5206) (36Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Moco, or Wco (TP1000) (37Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the latter one depending on the addition of molybdate or tungstate to the media. MCP was purified using a protocol that allows copurification of bound MPT, Moco, and/or Wco (38Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Its total pterin content was determined by HPLC FormA analysis, a method that cannot discriminate between MPT and Moco/Wco. The amount and purity of all MCP preparations were similar (Fig. 1A). No co-purified MPT was detected on MCP expressed in BL21, and only residual amounts were found with RK5206 cells grown in the absence of molybdate, demonstrating that MPT, which is accumulated in mogA mutants (38Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), did not bind to MCP. Consistent with the known partial reconstitution of mogA mutants by molybdate (5-10% Moco content of wild type (36Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), we found an increased pterin content when 100 μm molybdate was added to the culture medium, indicating selective binding of Moco. Similar amounts of co-purified pterin were detected upon expression in TP1000 cells in the absence of molybdate. Clear evidence for selective and high affinity binding of Moco arose from the molybdate-dependent co-purification of pterin (Moco) from TP1000 cells reaching Moco saturations of up to 6% (Fig. 1A). To synchronize intracellular protein and cofactor synthesis, we reduced the expression temperature to 22 °C and lowered the expression level (50 nm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside), resulting in 25% Moco saturation (Fig. 1B). We also replaced molybdate by tungstate (1 mm) and found an even higher co-purification of pterin (up to 75%), pointing to Wco binding as we have previously shown that MCP binds no MPT (Fig. 1A). The identity of co-purified Moco was confirmed by the nit-1 reconstitution assay (19Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. DeVries J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which was performed to detect exclusively Moco (39Hawkes T.R. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). According to the amount of co-purified pterin, Moco activity was found that correlated with the amount of molybdate added to the culture medium (Fig. 1A). In summary, MCP binds Moco with high affinity as described earlier (18Witte C.P. Igeno M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernandez E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Ataya F.S. Witte C.P. Galvan A. Igeno M.I. Fernandez E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10885-10890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but this binding is highly specific to Moco and Wco because metal-free MPT is not bound. UV-visible Absorption Spectra of Cofactor Saturated MCP—As MCP was purified highly saturated with either Moco or Wco, we applied UV-visible spectroscopy to analyze the metal centers. MCP saturated with Moco (25%) shows absorption at 393 nm and additional shoulders around 470 and 570 nm (Fig. 1C). Similar to plant (40Eilers T. Schwarz G. Brinkmann H. Witt C. Richter T. Nieder J. Koch B. Hille R. Hansch R. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46989-46994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and animal SOs (41Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the absorption at 393 nm can be attributed to the ene-dithiolate-to-molybdenum charge transfer bond. For rat SO, it was demonstrated that an additional absorption band around 500 nm is derived from the cysteine-to-molybdenum charge transfer bond (41Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As MCP lacks any cysteine, the absorption bands at higher wavelengths might point to additional amino acid-to-molybdenum charge transfer bonds. Upon aerobic incubation (12 h), all aforementioned bands are lowered, which is mainly due to degradation of Moco (see below). However, slight changes are observed, such as a more pronounced peak at 393 nm and shoulder at 470 nm (Fig. 1C, dotted line). The addition of excess dithionite (as compared with bound Moco) resulted in small but distinct changes in the spectrum. All three absorption bands are diminished upon reduction, resulting in a spectrum almost identical to the initial one, which indicates, together with the anaerobic purification of MCP, that Moco is co-purified in a reduced state and can be oxidized. UV-visible spectra of Wco-loaded MCP do not show any pronounced profile in the range of 350-700 nm (Fig. 1D). Upon aerobic incubation, an overall reduction of absorption can be seen with a slight increase between 600 and 700 nm, whereas the addition of dithionite did not alter the spectrum significantly. MCP Protects Moco and Wco from Oxidation—Next we investigated the stability of MCP-bound Moco and Wco under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). For both ligands, temperature- and time-dependent degradation was found, with Moco degrading much faster than Wco at all temperatures examined. The half-lives of Moco were not much affected by reduced temperatures. In contrast, the stability of Wco at high temperatures was similar to Moco, whereas at 4 °C, nearly no degradation was found. This points to a tighter binding of Wco to MCP and might explain why Wco was able to co-purify with up to 75% saturation. Moco Transfer from MCP to NR—High levels of co-purified Moco and Wco indicate high affinity binding to MCP, suggesting a Moco storage function. Thus we also wanted to know whether MCP transfers Moco (and also Wco) directly to the user enzyme or whether the ligand is released by dissociation and later bound to the enzymes. nit-1 reconstitutions with Moco-loaded MCP in the presence of increasing concentrations of tungstate (Fig. 2C) showed that only with 10 mm tungstate was Moco activity significantly inhibited, indicating rapid transfer between MCP and apo-NR. When using Wco-loaded (25%) MCP, no nit-1 activity was found according to the presence of the antagonistic metal tungsten. In contrast to the displacement of molybdenum by tungsten during Moco transfer, no reconstitution was found for Wco-bound MCP in the presence of external molybdate, demonstrating the tight binding of tungsten to MPT and/or Wco to MCP. The competition by tungstate pointed to a rapid transfer of Moco to NR. Therefore, we investigated the kinetics of NR reconstitution by Moco-loaded MCP. In a first set of experiments, we used different amounts of Moco-loaded MCP and observed a saturation of nit-1 activity upon 1-2 h of incubation (Fig. 2E). However, at lower concentrations, we also observed a further increase in activity after 2 h. When using different amounts of diluted Moco bound to MCP (55-165 fmol), a time- and dose-dependent reconstitution of NR activity was seen (Fig. 2F). Final saturation was reached between 10 and 21 h with activity levels corresponding to the amount of Moco, indicating a stoichiometric transfer. Reduction in activity after 21 h points to degradation of Moco and/or NR. Structure Determination of MCP—Purified MCP was crystallized as Se-Met and native protein. Both proteins formed crystals in orthorhombic space groups containing four (P212121) or two MCP molecules (C2221) per asymmetric unit, respectively (Table 1). The structure of MCP was solved by single anomalous diffraction using a 2.4 Å Se-Met data set (MCP1), which was refined to a final R-factor of 20.4% (Rfree = 26.5%). Two other data sets of native MCP crystals were collected at 1.6 Å (MCP2) and 2.3 Å resolution (MCP3). Structures were determined by molecular replacement using the Se-Met model and refined to R-factors of 18.4 and 18.0%, respectively (Table 1). All models have well defined stereochemistry with no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as determined by PROCHECK (42Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Apart from the N-terminal His tag and the first 2 or 3 residues as well as a stretch of 1-5 residues between positions 70 and 75, the structures are completely defined (Table 1). MCP Structure—The MCP monomer resembles the Rossmann fold with an outer layer of five α-helices (α1-α5) packed in the opposite direction from a central parallel β-sheet (β1-β7) (Fig. 3A). The strands β3 and β4 are connected via a highly flexible loop (residues 70-75). Some of these residues are completely delocalized, or when residual electron density was visible, we substituted them for alanines to trace the backbone (Table 1). The overall fold of the eight analyzed monomers (MCP1-MCP3) is very similar with an average root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.59 Å as determined by LSQMAN (43Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr.

Furthermore, the number of pancreatic β-cells decreases as a secondary effect of advanced type 2 diabetes, although the molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. Recently, it has been shown that hyperglycemic conditions induce the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in pancreatic islets and increase the downstream product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). To investigate whether high glucose-induced PGE2 has an adverse effect on pancreatic β-cells, we generated transgenic mice (RIP-C2mE) that express cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 in their β-cells using the rat insulin-2 gene promoter (RIP). The homozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice showed severe hyperglycemia from six weeks of age. Although the heterozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice showed normal blood glucose levels throughout their lifetime, this level increased significantly compared with that of wild-type mice when glucose was loaded. The relative number of β-cells to the total islet cell number was reduced to 54 and 14% in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) and (Tg/Tg) mice, respectively, whereas that in the wild-type mice was 84%. Importantly, the proliferation rate in the islets of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice at four weeks of age decreased significantly in comparison to that in the wild-type mice. Because β-cells replicate not only during the postnatal period but also in the adult pancreas at a basal level, it is possible that increased PGE2 signaling thus contributes to the reduction of the pancreatic β-cell mass through inhibition of proliferation, thereby aggravating diabetes further.

Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). For example, the treatment of isolated islets with IL-1 inhibits insulin secretion, and this is followed by islet destruction (6Bendtzen K. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Nerup J. Nielsen J.H. Dinarello C.A. Svenson M. Science. 1986; 232: 1545-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Moreover, adenoviral transduction of the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein into the islets protects against the IL-1β-induced dysfunction (7Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Ghivizzani S.C. Gambotto A. Ricordi C. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the long term exposure of islets to high glucose conditions has been shown to result in the induction of IL-1β, followed by β-cell apoptosis (8Maedler K. Sergeev P. Ris F. Oberholzer J. Joller-Jemelka H.I. Spinas G.A. Kaiser N. Halban P.A. Donath M.Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). This high glucose-induced β-cell destruction is prevented by treating the islets with an IL-1 receptor antagonist. Accordingly, it is possible that IL-1β plays a pivotal role in type 2 diabetes as well. Recently, it has been reported that high glucose conditions induce the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in pancreatic islets with an increase of the downstream product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (9Persaud S.J. Burns C.J. Belin V.D. Jones P.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S190-S192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shanmugam N. Todorov I.T. Nair I. Omori K. Reddy M.A. Natarajan R. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression has also been detected in the pancreatic islets of db/db mice, a mouse model for type 2 diabetes mellitus (10Shanmugam N. Todorov I.T. Nair I. Omori K. Reddy M.A. Natarajan R. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). COX-2 is a rate-limiting enzyme for prostanoid biosynthesis and plays various roles in physiological and pathological conditions such as reproduction, inflammation, and tumorigenesis (11DuBois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van de Putte L.B.A. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Although conflicting results have been reported, several studies indicate that the COX-2 pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. For example, IL-1β (a cytokine responsible for type 1 diabetes) induces COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in pancreatic islets (12Sorli C.H. Zhang J.-J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). IL-1β-induced β-cell dysfunction is suppressed by the treatment of the islets with COX-2 inhibitors (13Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, the destruction of the pancreatic β-cells in streptozotocin-treated mice was inhibited by treatment with a COX-2-selective inhibitor, NS-398 (14Tabatabaie T. Waldon A.M. Jacob J.M. Floyd R.A. Kotake Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the hyperglycemia-induced production of IL-1β in the islets of type 2 diabetes causes the dysfunction and destruction of β-cells through further induction of the COX-2 pathway. To investigate the genetic mechanism of PGE2 signaling in pancreatic islets, we constructed transgenic mice that expressed COX-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in their pancreatic β-cells by using the rat insulin-2 gene promoter (RIP). The inducible enzyme mPGES-1 catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 and appears to be functionally coupled with COX-2 (15Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In this study, we have provided genetic evidence that increased PGE2 signaling causes the decrease of pancreatic β-cells in a dose-dependent manner. Transgenic Mice—The RIP fragment (704 bp; nucleotide position -695 to +8 of the rat insulin-2 gene) was amplified by PCR using rat genomic DNA and the primers 5′-GGGATCCCCCAACCACT-3′ and 5′-TTAGGGCTGGGGGTTACTGAA-3′. After confirming the nucleotide sequences, the RIP fragment was subcloned into both expression vectors of COX-2 and mPGES-1 at the 5′ position in the same orientation as that of cDNAs. Both expression vectors contained RIP, a synthetic chimeric intron excised from pCI (Promega, La Jolla, CA), cDNA for mouse COX-2 or mPGES-1, and a SV40 poly(A) cassette (see Fig. 1A). Mouse COX-2 and mPGES-1 cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as previously described (16Oshima H. Oshima M. Inaba K. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The transcription unit was excised from each expression vector, purified, and co-microinjected into fertilized eggs from a cross between F1 (C3H and C57BL/6) hybrid females and C57BL/6 males. We obtained 14 founder mice that carried both the COX-2 and mPGES-1 transgenes. Among the F1 progenies of these 14 lines, two lines (RIP-C2mE mouse line 8 and RIP-C2mE mouse line 9) showed high amounts of both COX-2 and mPGES-1 mRNAs in their pancreatic tissues. These two transgenic lines showed essentially the same phenotypes. N2-backcrossed transgenic mice with C57BL/6 were intercrossed to generate homozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) and heterozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice. Backcrossing was performed using wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Mice of the N2F1 generation were used for the experiments. Littermate wild-type mice were used as controls for the experiments. Genotyping was performed by genomic PCR using tail DNA and the following primer sets: COX-2, 5′-CAAACTCAAGTTTGACCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCCGGGATCCTTTTACAGCTCAGTTGAACG-3′; mPGES-1, 5′-CCGAATTCTTGAAGTCCAGGCCGGCTAG-3′ and 5′-GTCAGCAGTAGCCTCATCATCACT-3′. Homozygotes were identified by increased band intensities of the genomic PCR products in comparison to those of the heterozygotes. Pancreatic Islet Isolation—Pancreata injected with 0.2% collagenase Type I (Invitrogen) in Hanks' buffered saline solution via the bile duct were collected and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After digestion, islets were then hand-picked using a dissecting microscope. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the isolated islets using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified. The primer sets used for genotyping were also used for RT-PCR analyses of COX-2 and mPGES-1. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. Measurement of Pancreatic PGE2 Level—The PGE2 levels were measured at SRL (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using six RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) and six wild-type mice at 20 weeks of age, and four RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) and four RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice at three weeks of age. Briefly, the pancreata were homogenized in a lysis buffer, and PGE2 was extracted with ethanol. The PGE2 levels were measured using the prostaglandin E2 [125I]RIA kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). According to the manufacturer's instruction manual, the cross-reactivity of this kit is as follows: PGE2 (100%), PGF2α (0.9%), PGD2 (0.3%), 6-keto-PGF1α (1%), and thromboxane B2 (0.01%). The islet PGE2 levels of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice relative to (Tg/-) mice at three weeks of age was calculated using the ratio of the islet area in the pancreas. To determine the ratio of the islet area in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) and (Tg/Tg) mice, five sections/pancreas of each genotype were scanned using an ImageJ program (NIH), and then the islet area was quantified versus the total pancreas area. Measurement of Blood Glucose, Plasma Insulin, and Plasma Glucagon Levels—The blood glucose levels were measured using Glutest AceR (Sanwa Chemical, Nagoya, Japan). For chronological observation, the blood glucose level was examined when the mice were 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks of age. In this experiment, six wild-type, 12 RIP-C2mE (Tg/-), and 11 RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice were used. The plasma insulin levels were examined through use of the High-Sensitive insulin measurement Kit that is based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (Morinaga, Yokohama, Japan) at 0 and 20 min of the glucose tolerance test. The plasma glucagon levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay that uses the glucagon kit Daiichi II at SRL (Tokyo, Japan), with 10 wild-type and 4 RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice. Glucose Tolerance Test—The mice were fasted for 14 h following an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1 g/kg body weight). Blood samples were obtained from a tail vein at 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min after the glucose injection. The blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were measured as described above. In the glucose tolerance test, seven wild-type and eight RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice at 50 weeks of age were used. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry—Pancreatic tissues of the mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. These sections were stained with H & E and were processed further for immunostaining. Rabbit polyclonal antibody for insulin (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) and sheep polyclonal antibody for glucagon (Biogenesis, England, UK) were used as the primary antibody for an immunohistochemistry to detect β- and α-cells, respectively. Rat monoclonal antibodies for CD3ϵ (BD Biosciences), F4/80 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), and Gr-1/Ly-6G (BD Biosciences) were used as the primary antibodies to detect T-cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, respectively. Staining signals were visualized using the Vectorstain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-sheep IgG or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the secondary antibody. Apoptosis Analysis—The pancreatic tissues of the mice at four weeks of age were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. Apoptosis was determined based upon the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method, which uses the ApopTag Peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Proliferation Analysis—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of a BrdUrd solution (1 mg/ml). At 3 h post-injection, pancreatic tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. The sections were immunostained with an anti-BrdUrd antibody using the BrdUrd In-Situ detection kit (BD Biosciences). The number of BrdUrd-labeled cells and the total number of islet cells were scored from 10 islets, and a mean BrdUrd labeling index was calculated. Scoring the Ratio of α- and β-Cells in the Pancreatic Islets—At least six non-overlapping fields of the fluorescence-immunostained sections were photographed (total number of islets >12), and the number of glucagon-positive α-cells and insulin-positive β-cells were scored. The ratio of α-cells and β-cells in the islet was calculated by dividing each number with the total number of islet cells. The total cell number in each islet was scored using the same sections under a differential interference microscope (DM5000B, Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were carried out using the unpaired Student's t test, and a p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. To investigate the effects of PGE2 on the pancreatic β-cells in mice, we generated transgenic (RIP-C2mE) mice expressing both COX-2 and mPGES-1 by co-microinjection of the two expression vectors (Fig. 1A). We used RIP to target the β-cells in the pancreatic islets. To increase the expression level of the transgenes, we introduced a synthetic intron between the RIP and cDNAs for COX-2 and mPGES-1 (16Oshima H. Oshima M. Inaba K. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Two transgenic lines (RIP-C2mE mouse line 8 and RIP-C2mE mouse line 9) essentially exhibited the same phenotype (data not shown). Accordingly, we present the results with RIP-C2mE mouse line 8 (hereafter referred to as RIP-C2mE). We detected high amounts of mRNA of COX-2 and mPGES-1 by RT-PCR in the isolated islets from the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice, whereas the expression of both genes was found in the wild-type islets at a basal level (Fig. 1B). We consistently found strong immunostaining signals for COX-2 and mPGES-1 in the pancreatic islets of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice compared with those of the wild-type mice (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, pancreatic PGE2 levels at 20 weeks of age increased significantly in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice (10.9 ± 2.2 pg/mg) in comparison to that in the wild-type mice (4.2 ± 0.5 pg/mg), indicating that the simultaneous transgenic expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 produced PGE2 in vivo. The blood glucose level in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice did not differ from that in the wild-type mice at four months of age (data not shown). To examine whether increased PGE2 affects β-cell function under hyperglycemic conditions, we carried out the glucose tolerance test using fasted RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice showed a significant increase in the blood glucose level in comparison to that in the wild-type mice from 10 to 60 min after the glucose injection. In the wild-type mice, the plasma insulin level at 20 min post-glucose injection increased significantly in comparison to that at 0 min (Fig. 2B). However, the plasma insulin level in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice at 20 min was significantly lower than that in the wild-type mice, although it had increased 1.3-fold of the basal level at 0 min. These results indicate that increased PGE2 in the pancreatic β-cells causes impaired insulin secretion under hyperglycemic conditions. To further investigate the role of PGE2 signaling in pancreatic β-cells, we intercrossed heterozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice to generate homozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice that carried double the copy number of each transgene. The mean PGE2 level in the pancreas of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mouse at three weeks of age was higher than that in the pancreas of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice, although it was not significant (Fig. 3A). However, the ratio of the islet area in the pancreas of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice was lower than that in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice (0.39 and 0.59% of the total pancreas in the Tg/Tg and Tg/-mice, respectively). Consequently, the relative islet PGE2 level in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice was 1.9-fold higher than that in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice (Fig. 3B). We determined the blood glucose level chronologically when the mice were 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks of age (Fig. 3C). The blood glucose levels in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice were normal at all examined ages; this was consistent with the results of the glucose tolerance test. However, the homozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice showed a significant increase in the blood glucose levels from six weeks of age, thus suggesting that insulin secretion was inhibited by PGE2 signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the blood glucose level of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice at three weeks of age was at the normal level, indicating that the dysfunction of the pancreatic β-cells was not caused by the congenital anomaly of the pancreatic islets. We then examined the pancreatic β-cells by fluorescence immunohistochemistry using pancreatic tissue of the respective mouse genotypes at 16 weeks of age. In the wild-type mice, the insulin-positive β-cells predominated the pancreatic islets, whereas the glucagon-producing α-cells were found scattered in the marginal regions of the islets (Fig. 4A). In the heterozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice, the number of β-cells decreased compared with that in the wild-type mice, whereas the α-cell population increased slightly (Fig. 4B). In sharp contrast to the wild-type mice, α-cells predominated the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mouse islets, and the β-cells were sparsely distributed in the center of the islets (Fig. 4C). The mean relative ratio of β-cells to the total number of islet cells was 84, 54, and 14% in the wild-type, RIP-C2mE (Tg/-), and (Tg/Tg) mice, respectively (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the mean ratio of α-cells increased inversely with the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) and (Tg/Tg) mice (Fig. 4E). However, the mean plasma glucagon level in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice stayed at a similar level to that found in the wild-type mice (97.0 ± 4.4 pg/ml and 101.3 ± 9.2 pg/ml in the wild-type and RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice, respectively). These results collectively indicate that an increase in the PGE2 level causes a diabetic phenotype through a decrease in the number of pancreatic β-cells. To rule out the possibility that PGE2 signaling impairs the development of the pancreatic islets, we carried out fluorescence immunohistochemistry with mice at three weeks of age. The number of pancreatic β-cells in the wild-type mice at three weeks of age was less than that found at 16 weeks of age (Fig. 5, A and C; Fig. 4, A and D). It is possible that the number of β-cells was still increasing at three weeks of age, because β-cells replicate during the postnatal period to increase the β-cell mass to that of an adult level (17Svenstrup K. Skau M. Pakkenberg B. Buschard K. Bock T. APMIS. 2002; 110: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Notably, the number of β-cells in the homozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice was at the same level as that in the wild-type mice (Fig. 5, B and C). Consistently, the number of α-cells in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice also demonstrated the same level as that of the wild-type mice (Fig. 5D). These results, taken together, indicate that increased PGE2 signaling causes a decrease in the number of β-cells after weaning. To further investigate the mechanism of β-cell destruction, we examined apoptosis in the pancreatic islets at four weeks of age by the TUNEL method. However, we did not find any apoptotic cells in the islets of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice or the wild-type mice (data not shown). We thus examined the cell proliferation rate by BrdUrd incorporation at four weeks of age. Although the proliferation rate in the islets of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice was almost the same as that in the wild-type mice (Fig. 5, E, F, and H), it was decreased significantly in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice (Fig. 5, G and H), thus suggesting that PGE2 signaling inhibits the proliferation of β-cells. It has been suggested that the COX-2 pathway is involved in the development of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (12Sorli C.H. Zhang J.-J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 273: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was thus possible that the increased PGE2 signaling had induced a host inflammatory or immune response in the pancreatic islets, thus causing further β-cell destruction. To assess this possibility, we histologically examined the islets of the homozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice. Although the islets of the (Tg/Tg) mice appeared to be smaller than those of the wild-type mice, no inflammatory cell infiltration was observed around either of the islets in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) and wild-type mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, we did not find any infiltration of T lymphocytes (CD3), macrophages (F4/80), or neutrophils (Gr-1) around islets of the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice at both 4 and 16 weeks of age (Fig. 6, C-F). Therefore, these results indicate that an inflammatory or immune response is not involved in the PGE2-induced destruction of pancreatic β-cells. In advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus, the pancreatic β-cell mass reduces through oxidative stress-related damage or increased apoptosis, resulting in secondary adverse effects upon β-cells (2Sakuraba H. Mizukami H. Yagihashi N. Wada R. Hanyu C. Yagihashi S. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 3Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C.

Naji A. Matschinsky F.M. Markmann J.F. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that hyperglycemic conditions induce the IL-1β, which is responsible for the dysfunction and destruction of pancreatic β-cells (8Maedler K. Sergeev P. Ris F. Oberholzer J. Joller-Jemelka H.I. Spinas G.A. Kaiser N. Halban P.A. Donath M.Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that COX-2 expression is also induced in the pancreatic islets under high glucose conditions (9Persaud S.J. Burns C.J. Belin V.D. Jones P.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S190-S192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shanmugam N. Todorov I.T. Nair I. Omori K. Reddy M.A. Natarajan R. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-1β signaling stimulates COX-2 induction and PGE2 production in pancreatic islets (12Sorli C.H. Zhang J.-J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13767-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These results, taken together, suggest that COX-2 plays a role in the IL-1β-induced β-cell damage. Here, we have demonstrated that the expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1, which leads to an increase in islet PGE2 production, causes a significant decrease in the number of pancreatic β-cells. These results provide the first genetic evidence for the causal role of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway in β-cell destruction. Importantly, after doubling the number of copies of COX-2 and mPGES-1 by generating homozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice, there was severe reduction of the β-cell mass with a significant increase in the blood glucose level when compared with the heterozygous RIP-C2mE (Tg/-) mice. Therefore, it is possible that the induction level of COX-2 and PGE2 is correlated with the severity of the pancreatic β-cell damage in type 2 diabetes. Although the number of α-cells was elevated in the adult RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mice, the plasma glucagon level was not increased. Thus, increased blood glucose is caused by the reduced number of β-cells and not by the increased number of α-cells. We herein found a significant decrease in the cell proliferation rate in the RIP-C2mE (Tg/Tg) mouse islets at four weeks of age. Because β-cells replicate during the postnatal period (17Svenstrup K. Skau M. Pakkenberg B. Buschard K. Bock T. APMIS. 2002; 110: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it is possible that these proliferating cells are β-cells and that PGE2 signaling inhibits this β-cell proliferation. The number of β-cells in the normal adult islets is regulated by a balance between proliferation and apoptosis (19Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that it takes three months for the renewal of 50% of the pancreatic β-cells (20Finegood D.T. Scaglia I. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and nine months for the renewal of 98% (21Dor Y. Brown J. Martinez O.I. Melton D.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is conceivable that increased PGE2 signaling suppresses β-cell proliferation in the adult islets, resulting in gradual reduction of the β-cell mass. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the expression of p27Kip1 plays a key role in regulation of the pancreatic β-cell mass and that deletion of the gene encoding p27Kip1 in the type 2 diabetes model (db/db mice) prevents β-cell destruction (22Uchida T. Nakamura T. Hashimoto N. Matsuda T. Kotani K. Sakaue H. Kido Y. Hayashi Y. Nakawama K. White M.F. Kasuga M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to investigate the underlying relationship between PGE2 and p27Kip1 in β-cell destruction. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by β-cell destruction due to autoimmune responses, which are critically dependent upon the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T-cells. Because we did not observe inflammatory or immune cell infiltration around the pancreatic islets in the RIP-C2mE mice, we concluded that the inhibition of β-cell proliferation in our mouse model is not caused by host immune responses. However, IL-1β signaling also plays an important role in the β-cell destruction of type 1 diabetes (23Mandrup-Poulsen T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1005: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the IL-1β-induced inhibition of insulin secretion is suppressed by COX-2 inhibitors; this is reconfirmed by exogenous PGE2 stimulation (13Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that PGE2 plays some role as a downstream mediator of the IL-1β pathway during β-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes as well. It has been suggested that chronic inflammation plays an etiological role in type 2 diabetes (24Schmidt M.I. Duncan B.B. Sharrett A.R. Lindberg G. Savage P.J. Offenbacher S. Azambuja M.I. Tracy R.P.

Weyer C. Lindsay R.S. Pratley R.E. Bogardus C. Tataranni P.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that chronic inflammatory responses are involved in the decrease of pancreatic β-cells via the induction of COX-2 and PGE2, which leads to an increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Moreover, an epidemiological study has indicated the association of the promoter variant of the COX-2 gene with type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians (26Konheim Y.L. Wolford J.K. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although COX-2 is an inducible enzyme in most tissues, it has been shown to be expressed constitutively in pancreatic islets (27Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that an increase in the basal level of COX-2 expression, caused by a promoter poly-morphism, enhances the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes via the suppression of the renewing capabilities of islet β-cells. It is therefore possible that the blockade of PGE2 receptors or the inhibition of mPGES-1 is an effective therapeutic strategy against β-cell destruction in type 2 as well as type 1 diabetes mellitus.

We show here that the male germline is initiated by transcriptional control. We identify GRSF, germline-restrictive silencing factor, from the lily. GRSF is ubiquitous in nongerm cells and is absent from male germ cells. GRSF recognizes silencer sequences in promoters of genes specific to the germline, stably repressing these genes in cells that are not destined to become germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026692906,"Within the family of large GTP-binding proteins, human guanylate binding protein 1 (hGBP1) belongs to a subgroup of interferon-inducible proteins. GTP hydrolysis activity of these proteins is much higher compared with members of other GTPase families and underlies mechanisms that are not understood. The large GTP-binding proteins form self-assemblies that lead to stimulation of the catalytic activity. The unique result of GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by hGBP1 is GDP and GMP. We investigated this reaction mechanism by transient kinetic methods using radioactively labeled GTP as well as fluorescent probes. Substrate binding and formation of the hGBP1 homodimer are fast as no lag phase is observed in the time courses of GTP hydrolysis. Instead, multiple turnover experiments show a rapid burst of Pi formation prior to the steady state phase, indicating a rate-limiting step after GTP cleavage. Both molecules are catalytically active and cleave off a phosphate ion in the first step. Then bifurcation into catalytic inactivation, probably by irreversible dissociation of the dimer, and into GDP hydrolysis is observed. The second cleavage step is even faster than the first step, implying a rapid rearrangement of the nucleotide within the catalytic center of hGBP1. We could also show that the release of the products, including the phosphate ions, is fast and not limiting the steady state activity. We suggest that slow dissociation of the GMP-bound homodimer gives rise to the burst behavior and controls the steady state.

GTP-binding proteins control a multitude of cellular functions ranging from protein translation, signal transduction, and regulation of the cytoskeleton to endocytosis and immunological response. Timed and specific action of these proteins is achieved by adopting different conformations when in complex with either GDP or GTP (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). Only in one of the two states, in most cases the GTP-bound form, is the GTPase capable of fulfilling its function by specific interaction with other proteins. They can flip between these two states by GTP hydrolysis and by GDP dissociation followed by rebinding of abundant GTP. For many GTP-binding proteins, regulatory proteins have been identified and characterized, which can promote hydrolysis and dissociation, respectively, and thereby control the action of the GTPase. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis is important for understanding the biological function on the molecular level. Large GTPases make up a protein superfamily with biological functions that can be grouped in two classes (2Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Dynamin and dynamin-like proteins play a key role in membrane scission and fusion, whereas interferon-induced proteins like Mx and hGBP1 (human guanylate binding protein 1) are involved in antiviral defense (3Haller O. Kochs G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4Anderson S.L. Carton J.M. Lou J. Xing L. Rubin B.Y. Virology. 1999; 256: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Being a member of this superfamily is not decided only by the molecular size of the proteins, ranging between 65 and 100 kDa, but also by common biochemical properties and structural features. In contrast to small GTPases like Ras, Rab, Rho, etc. and α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, they bind the guanine nucleotides GDP and GTP not very tightly thus showing Kd values in the micromolar range (5Uthaiah R.C. Praefcke G.J. Howard J.C. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29336-29343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This low affinity is caused by fast dissociation rates as compared with small GTPases. Also GTP hydrolysis is faster and, more strikingly, is enhanced by self-association of the large GTPases. For dynamin and Mx, the formation of helical assemblies after binding of GTP is described (6Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 7Zhang P.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), whereas hGBP1 forms homodimers when bound to GTP (10Ghosh A. Praefcke G.J. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2006; 440: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Prakash B. Praefcke G.J. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Regarding the structure the most conspicuous difference to other GTPases is a large helical domain extending to the C terminus of the protein. Biochemical work on dynamin and Mx has shown that a C-terminal subdomain takes part in the activation of GTP hydrolysis and is therefore named GTPase effector domain. How exactly the extra domains work in respect to enhanced GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide dissociation and how far they might replace regulatory proteins that are observed for other GTPases have not been resolved (12Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 13Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T.

Mutations of residues critical for catalysis of GTP hydrolysis were identified in many GTPases resulting in malfunction and diseases. The most prominently known are point mutations in small GTP-binding proteins like Ras and Rho leading to cancer (17Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar), but also mutations in large GTPases like dynamin, atlastin, and OPA1 leading to impairment of GTP hydrolysis may result in disease (18Bitoun M. Maugenre S. Jeannet P.Y. Lacene E. Ferrer X. Laforet P. Martin J.J. Laporte J. Lochmuller H. Beggs A.H. Fardeau M. Eymard B. Romero N.B. Guicheney P. Nat.

Although all large GTPases are extraordinary in respect to the role and the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis being linked to self-assembly, hGBP1 is even more unique as the result of catalyzed GTP hydrolysis is phosphate and GMP to the major part and only a small fraction of GDP (22Schwemmle M. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11299-11305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier we have characterized affinity and binding kinetics of all three guanine nucleotides and have shown homodimer formation of hGBP1 only upon binding to GTP analogs (11Prakash B. Praefcke G.J. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 23Praefcke G.J. Geyer M. Schwemmle M. Kalbitzer H.R. Herrmann C. J. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 344: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GDP as well as the GMP form of hGBP1 are monomers, and GDP hydrolysis is not detected. This study addresses the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by a transient kinetic approach. Using rapid flow techniques allows us to resolve successive steps in the course of GTP hydrolysis. Protein Preparation—hGBP1 with an N-terminal His6 tag was synthesized from a pQE9 vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (23Praefcke G.J. Geyer M. Schwemmle M. Kalbitzer H.R. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The concentration of hGBP1 was calculated from the absorbance at 276 nm in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, using a molar absorption coefficient of 45,400 m–1 cm–1 (23Praefcke G.J. Geyer M. Schwemmle M. Kalbitzer H.R. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nucleotides—GTP was purchased from Sigma and was purified by ion exchange chromatography as described by Lenzen et al. (25Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mant 2The abbreviations used are: mant-, N-methyl-anthraniloyl-; MDCC, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide; PBP, phosphate-binding protein. -nucleotides were synthesized according to Ref. 25Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar. The purity of the nucleotides was greater than 98% as verified by high pressure liquid chromatography (25Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nucleotide concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 253 nm using the absorption coefficients 13,700 and 22,600 m–1 cm–1 for nonlabeled and mant-nucleotides, respectively (26Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Rapid Quench Flow Kinetics—Transient enzyme kinetics were investigated with the help of the rapid quench flow technique using an RQF-3 instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). To obtain time courses of GTP hydrolysis, solutions of (nucleotide-free) hGBP1 and GTP containing 10 nCi/μl [α-32P]- or [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences) were rapidly mixed (15 μl each) in a first mixing device. The reactions were stopped after different time intervals by using 1 m perchloric acid as the quenching solution in the second mixing step. The pH value of quenched reaction mixtures was raised to about 5 by addition of potassium acetate. The solutions were centrifuged (3 min at 15,000 × g) to remove precipitated potassium perchlorate and protein, and the supernatant was subjected to further analysis for substrate and product concentrations. Nucleotides and phosphate were separated by TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose (Merck) with 0.65 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.5, as developing solution. The relative amounts were quantified using a FLA-3000 PhosphorImager (Fuji, Kanasawa, Japan). In cold substrate chase experiments, the acid was replaced by highly concentrated GTP as quenching solution. After a second incubation time, the reaction was finally stopped by manual addition of acid, and the solution was processed and analyzed as described above. Stopped-flow Kinetics of Nucleotide Binding and Dissociation—Stopped-flow measurements were performed in an SFM400 apparatus with MOS-200 optics (Bio-Logic, Grenoble, France). In competitive binding experiments, hGBP1 was mixed with solutions of constant mant-GMP and increasing GTP concentrations. Nucleotides were in at least 5- or 10-fold excess over protein, providing pseudo-first order conditions in case the dissociation rates of both nucleotides can be neglected (27Nowak E. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8613-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Dissociation rate constants of GDP and GMP were measured by displacing the (nonlabeled) nucleotides from the preformed complexes by a 20- or 40-fold excess of mant-GDP. Fluorescence was excited at 295 nm and detected after passing through a 400 nm cut-off filter. In both types of experiments fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residues in hGBP1 and the mant-fluorophor on the nucleotide was used because direct excitation of the mant-group leads to high fluorescence background. Kinetics of Pi Release—Pi release was studied according to the method of Brune et al. (29Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), which is based on the fluorescence change of a coumarin-labeled phosphate-binding protein (PBP) from E. coli. The A197S mutant of PBP was prepared and labeled with N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC) as described by Brune et al. (30Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Following this procedure we obtained protein, which was labeled to more than 93%, as determined from the absorbance at 280 and 430 nm. The Pi responsiveness of our preparation was analyzed by fluorescence titration using an LS-55 spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). MDCC-PBP at 125 μm was titrated with a potassium phosphate solution containing the same MDCC-PBP concentration. Excitation and emission wavelength were 430 nm and 465 nm, respectively. Kinetics of Pi release were measured under single turnover conditions using the SFM400 stopped-flow instrument. The concentrations of hGBP1 and GTP were the same as in the quench flow experiments. MDCC-PBP was added to both nucleotide and hGBP1 solutions. The fluorescence was excited at 430 nm and monitored after passing through a 455 nm cut-off filter. The Pi concentration was obtained from the fluorescence signal after normalization to the Pi concentration calculated from a parallel rapid quench flow experiment. To minimize phosphate contamination, the fluorescence cuvettes and the stopped-flow apparatus were incubated for 30 min with 400 μm 7-methylguanosine and 1 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase before the measurements (29Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at least in duplicate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithioerythritol at 25 °C unless indicated otherwise. Data Analysis—Analysis of single transients was performed by nonlinear regression, using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). Single-turnover kinetics of GTP hydrolysis lead to three nucleotide time courses that were analyzed simultaneously by a global fit using the program Scientist (MicroMath). For this kind of analysis the differential equations derived from Scheme 2 were used yielding the values for k1, k2, and k3. Correspondingly, and with the same program, the kinetics of the multiple turnover experiments were analyzed according to Scheme 3, which results in the value for k4. Here, the constants as indicated in Scheme 3 were used as fixed values, and for the fast association and dissociation rate constant values of 100 μm–1 s–1 and 100 s–1 were used, respectively.SCHEME 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Multiturnover Kinetics—GTP hydrolysis was measured with the help of radioactively labeled GTP, and in a first approach we used [γ-32P]GTP. To resolve the early phase of GTP hydrolysis, we used a rapid quench flow apparatus that allows us to stop the reaction after a short time and to analyze for product (or intermediate) formation. First, GTP hydrolysis kinetics were measured by mixing hGBP1 with an excess of substrate, i.e. multiple turnover conditions. Concentrations of GTP were chosen such that association with hGBP1 is fast according to our results from binding kinetics (see below). A concentration of 350 μm GTP ensures that binding is completed to 99% after 5 ms. The dissociation constant of the GTP-bound hGBP1 dimer was estimated to lie below 1 μm (11Prakash B. Praefcke G.J. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) so that we can assume almost quantitative dimer formation in our experiments. Fig. 1 shows a typical multiple turnover experiment with the concentration of hGBP1 at 50 μm and [γ-32P]GTP at 350 μm. The time course of cleaved phosphate concentration, [Pi], normalized to the total enzyme concentration, [E]0, is shown, and two kinetic phases can clearly be distinguished. After a fast exponential rise, the onset of a linear steady state phase was observed. Three parameters in Equation 1 are needed to describe this observation, i.e. the size of the burst amplitude, A, the rate constant for the initial exponential phase, k, and the steady state rate constant, s; PiE0=A·1-e-k·t+s·t(Eq. 1) The burst amplitude of phosphate cleavage is 0.63 as a result of the fit and as indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 1. The values obtained for the rate constants are k = 0.74 s–1 and s = 0.25 s–1. This type of kinetics demands a minimum of two reaction steps as shown in Scheme 1. According to Scheme 1, there are three constants representing the rate of the first step, k1, and all of following steps (at least one), kf, and the concentration of catalytically active enzyme, [E]a. They define the three parameters of Equation 1 according to Equations 2, 3, 4 (31Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1999: 153-157Google Scholar). A=EaE0k1k1+kf2(Eq. 2) k=k1+kf(Eq. 3) s=EaE0k1·kfk1+kf(Eq. 4) Analysis of the phosphate transient in Fig. 1 on the basis of Scheme 1 by using Equations 1, 2, 3, 4 yields the rate constants k1 = 0.50 s–1 and kf = 0.27 s–1. Thus the first step is not much faster than the following leading to a burst amplitude smaller than 1. Surprisingly, the fit results in a value larger than 1 for the active enzyme fraction, [E]a/[E]0 = 1.4, which could be explained by a systematic error on the protein and/or nucleotide concentration.SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At this stage of kinetic analysis only γ-phosphate is detected. Further potential steps in the catalytic mechanism like GDP hydrolysis and product release are dismantled in kf. With this type of experiment and the use of [γ-32P]GTP, formation of GMP was not possible to detect. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to mention that no formation of pyrophosphate was observed in the course of these experiments. As a positive control in TLC, radioactive pyrophosphate generated from [γ-32P]GTP by incubation with phosphodiesterase was used. Single-turnover Kinetics—In a next step we studied the hydrolysis of GTP under single-turnover conditions where the kinetics of nucleotide release are not relevant. To this end we used [α-32P]GTP, which allows us to follow the transients of all nucleotides. The reaction is started by mixing equal volumes of 150 μm hGBP1 and 70 μm [α-32P]GTP in a rapid quench flow apparatus. Typical results of this kind of experiment are shown in Fig. 2. As already known not only GDP but also GMP is formed by hGBP1-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP. In the experiments of the previous section only formation of phosphate ions was observed, and no pyrophosphate was seen. Here it is most evident that GDP is generated in a first step followed by cleavage of another phosphate ion leading to the formation of GMP. At the beginning of the time trace of GMP a clear lag phase is observed in Fig. 2, which is the result of the successive phosphate cleavage mechanism. In particular, the experiment at 37 °C in Fig. 2B shows that GDP is formed as an intermediate, which is for the most part hydrolyzed further and yields GMP as the major product. The data in Fig. 2 can be explained by Scheme 2, which includes two successive hydrolysis steps and an inactivation step that we assume to be dimer dissociation. Competition of the second step of hydrolysis and the inactivation accounts for the final ratios of the products GMP and GDP, which are 72:28 at 25 °C and 95:5 at 37 °C. Global fit analysis according to Scheme 2 and as described under “Experimental Procedures” yields the rate constants k1 = 0.43 s–1, k2 = 2.2 s–1, and k3 = 0.87 s–1 at 25 °C and k1 = 3.9 s–1, k2 = 8.03 s–1, and k3 = 0.40 s–1 at 37 °C. Most notably, the first step is slower than the following, which cannot explain the phosphate burst behavior. Substrate Binding Kinetics Using Stopped-flow—Elucidation of the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis presupposes knowledge about the binding kinetics of the substrate. As we have used nucleotide analogs carrying a fluorescence label in our earlier studies, we determined here the binding kinetics of GTP, i.e. the genuine substrate that we also used for the investigation of the hydrolysis above. For this purpose we followed the binding kinetics after mixing in a stopped-flow apparatus 2 equal volumes of 1.0 μm hGBP1 and 5.4 μm fluorescent mant-GMP (and in a second set of experiments 12 μm), including increasing concentrations of GTP. This competitive binding experiment yields the association rate constant of hGBP1 and GTP according to Equation 5 (27Nowak E. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8613-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Equation 5 is simplified by the assumption that the dissociation rates of the nucleotides can be neglected. For mant-GMP, a value of koff = 1.3 s–1 was determined earlier at 20 °C (24Praefcke G.J. Kloep S. Benscheid U. Lilie H. Prakash B. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). kobs=konGTP·[GTP]+konmGMP·[mGMP](Eq. 5) Fig. 3A shows typical fluorescence time traces that yield the kobs values by fitting an exponential equation. The results are shown in Fig. 3B together with the linear fit. The ordinate yields the kmGMPon value for mant-GMP, which is 4.5 μm–1 s–1 in the first set of experiments and 5.7 μm–1 s–1 in the second. These values are in good agreement with our earlier measurement of this value, namely 5.3 μm–1 s–1 at 20 °C (24Praefcke G.J. Kloep S. Benscheid U. Lilie H. Prakash B. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A value of kGTPon = 3.1 μm–1 s–1 (second set 3.0 μm–1 s–1) is obtained from these data for the association of hGBP1 and its substrate GTP. This is close to the kon value measured for mant-GTP (2.6 μm–1 s–1 at 20 °C (32Kunzelmann S. Praefcke G.J. Herrmann C. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 512-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)), and it shows that substrate binding is very fast compared with hydrolysis at the concentrations we have used above. Substrate Binding Kinetics Using Cold Substrate Chase—We determined the kinetics of GTP binding to hGBP1 by another independent method that does not necessitate the use of any fluorescent compounds. Cold substrate chase experiments allow quantification of the amount of bound GTP at individual time points by taking advantage of the enzymatic cleavage reaction. In these measurements mixtures of hGBP1 and [γ-32P]GTP were aged for short periods of time in a rapid quench flow device, and the binding reaction was stopped by the addition of a large excess of nonradioactive (cold) GTP. The mixtures were incubated for a few reciprocal turnover numbers (see above), i.e. 20 s, just enough to completely cleave the bound radioactive GTP. Then they were quenched in acid and analyzed for radioactive phosphate. The fraction of radioactive GTP, which has bound to the enzyme before the addition of cold substrate, is converted to product, whereas free labeled substrate is greatly diluted out and no longer participates in the binding and cleavage reactions. Thus, the amount of radioactive phosphate is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex formed during the first incubation period. Fig. 4 shows typical cold GTP chase experiments reflecting the association kinetics of 2.3 nm GTP and 20 and 40 μm hGBP1, respectively. Single exponential curve fitting yields the pseudo-first order rate constants kobs, which are 45 and 88 s–1 at 20 and 40 μm hGBP1, respectively. From these values the association rate constant kon = 2.2 μm–1 s–1 (1.7 μm–1 s–1 with a different protein preparation) is calculated, which is in good agreement with the result from the competitive stopped-flow experiments above. As the dissociation rate constant of the hGBP1-GTP complex is small compared with the kobs values, it cannot be determined accurately from these measurements. However, 100% Pi production is not reached (Fig. 4), which indicates that the GTP dissociation rate constant is of similar magnitude as the hydrolysis rate constant. Rate of Phosphate Release—In some nucleotide cleavage reactions the rate of phosphate release was found to be rate-limiting and responsible for the phosphate burst kinetics. For example, phosphate release in myosin ATPase turned out to be a crucial step triggering large conformational changes of the enzyme (33Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 161-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 34Trentham D.R. Eccleston J.F. Bagshaw C.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1976; 9: 217-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To address this issue we used a PBP that allows us to monitor in real time the increases of phosphate concentration because of dissociation from hGBP1 complexes. This assay is based on PBP covalently labeled with the fluorescent coumarin derivative MDCC, which binds phosphate ions rapidly (kon > 100 μm–1 s–1) and tightly (Kd ∼ 0.1 μm) accompanied by a large increase of its fluorescence intensity (29Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows a phosphate titration of our MDCC-PBP preparation (at 125 μm) demonstrating a linear response and an active site fraction of 95% under our experimental conditions. Phosphate release kinetics were studied with the help of a stopped-flow apparatus at 75 μm hGBP1 and 35 μm GTP. In addition, MDCC-PBP was present at 125 μm. The recorded fluorescence change is shown in Fig. 5B. From the single exponential fit to the data, a value of 0.41 s–1 was obtained for the rate constant matching the value of k1 measured above. Parallel to this experiment, a single-turnover experiment at the same GTP and hGBP1 concentrations was performed by rapid quench flow as described above. [α-32P]GTP was used and no was MDCC-PBP added, and the time courses of nucleotide concentrations were assayed as described. Quantitative comparison of phosphate and nucleotide concentrations necessitates multiplication of the GMP concentration by a factor of 2 as two phosphate ions stem from this nucleotide. The sum of the concentrations of GDP and GMP (times two) are shown in Fig. 5C together with the experimental fluorescence change from Fig. 5B. Here in Fig. 5C the maximum fluorescence value is normalized to a phosphate concentration of 59.5 μm (=1.7 × 35"

MNK3 is the domain most dissimilar in structure from the other domains of the Menkes protein. This is reflected in a significant rearrangement of the last strand of the four-stranded β-sheet when compared with the other known homologous proteins or protein domains.

In eukaryotes, copperdependent metalloenzymes are found in multiple cellular locations (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). Excess copper, however, is highly toxic to most organisms (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar, 2Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a complex machinery of proteins that bind the metal ion controls the uptake, transport, sequestration, and efflux of copper in vivo (3O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

In particular, so-called metallochaperones, which deliver copper to specific intracellular targets, lower the activation barrier for copper transfer to their specific partners (6Huffman D.L.

ATP7A and ATP7B have a long N-terminal cytosolic tail containing six putative metal-binding domains. Homologs of HAH1 and ATP7A/ATP7B are found in a large number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The number of metal-binding domains in ATP7A/ATP7B homologs is variable, ranging from one to six, with proteins from higher eukaryotic organisms, e.g. mammals, having a higher number of such domains their prokaryotic (typically one or two) or yeast (two) homologs (11Bull P.C.

Genome Res. 2002; 12: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography have provided structures of various metal-binding domains in different metallation states for both metallochaperones and the partner ATPases (13Wimmer R.

In some cases, the dynamic properties of the apo- and/or holoproteins have been directly probed by NMR in solution (13Wimmer R. Herrmann T. Solioz M. Wüthrich K. J. Biol.

The interaction between the two partners is copper(I)-dependent (16Strausak D. Howie M.K. Firth S.D. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Multhaup G. Mercer J.F. J. Biol.

Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Del Conte R. Gonnelli L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1939-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S.

An atomiclevel solution structure of the adduct formed by the yeast metallochaperone (Atx1) and the first metal-binding domain of the yeast ATPase (Ccc2a), in the presence of 1 equivalent of copper(I), has recently been determined (20Banci L.

The reasons why higher organisms have as many as six metal-binding domains are still unclear. Available studies on ATP7A or ATP7B trying to address this matter indicate some functional differentiation between the first four (counting from the N terminus) and the last two domains and suggest that the last two domains are sufficient for function (21Goodyer I.D. Jones E.E. Monaco A.P. Francis M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Voskoboinik I. Strausak D. Greenough M. Brooks H. Petris M. Smith S. Mercer J.F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, the mechanism of copper(I) transfer from HAH1 to either one of these two human ATPases is not completely elucidated. This process has been investigated through a variety of techniques, suggesting that there may be preferential interaction sites within the cytoplasmic tail of the ATPases. In particular, the second domain (24Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and/or the fourth domain (17van Dongen E.M. Klomp L.W. Merkx M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Chasapis C. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38259-38263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have been identified as preferential docking sites for HAH1. To obtain a detailed characterization at the atomic level of the role of the various domains in ATP7A, we have implemented a “divide-and-conquer” strategy by tackling a characterization of the structure, dynamics, metal-binding capabilities, and interaction with the protein partner, HAH1, of each individual soluble domain of the Menkes protein (26Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This approach enables the subsequent characterization of multidomain constructs, focusing on interdomain interactions and dynamics. With this approach, it was possible to study a three-domain construct, spanning ATP7A domains 4 to 6 (MNK456), and to obtain direct evidence that domain 4 is the entry site for copper(I) ions delivered by the partner and that the presence of copper(I) affects the reciprocal mobility of the three domains (25Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Chasapis C. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38259-38263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this article a structural characterization of the apo- and copper(I)-form of the third domain of ATP7A, the Menkes protein (MNK3), is reported. The interaction of MNK3 with the partner human protein HAH1 has also been investigated. MNK3 is the most differentiated metal-binding domain in ATP7A, with an average sequence identity to the other domains of 32 ± 4% and a few peculiarities with respect to the other domains in its sequence. It was found that the MNK3 structure experiences some local structural rearrangements upon copper(I), at variance with the structure of the other MNK domains. MNK3 was a comparatively poor acceptor of copper(I) from HAH1. The present study constitutes a necessary step for the high-resolution investigation of the entire cytoplasmic tail of ATP7A. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequence encoding MNK3, corresponding to amino acids 275-352 of ATP7A, was amplified via PCR and cloned in pET20, similar to what was previously done for other ATP7A domains (28Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. D'Onofrio M. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A C-terminal expression tag including His6 was introduced to ease purification. For the sake of simplicity, hereafter residues are numbered from 1 to 78 rather than starting from 275. The K46V mutant was obtained from the plasmid encoding wild type (WT) 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; r.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; MNKn, nth metal-binding domain of the human Menkes protein, ATP7A; DTT, dithiothreitol. -MNK3 through the QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis kit. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was used for protein expression. Cells were grown in minimal media with vitamin and metal supplements, using ampicillin and chloramphenicol for selection. All protein purification steps were carried out in an N2 atmosphere chamber by affinity chromatography with a HiTrap 5-ml affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) previously charged with Zn2+. Stable isotope enrichment (15Nor 13C, 15N) was performed by growing E. coli in M9 minimal medium using (NH4)2SO4 and glucose as the nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. For NMR experiments, apoprotein samples were reduced with excess dithiothreitol (DTT) and washed with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The final molar ratio of DTT to protein was typically 2-5-fold. Copper(I)-containing protein samples were prepared by incubating the apoprotein, after removal of DTT, with a slight excess of the acetonitrile complex of copper(I). Sample preparations were carried out in a N2 atmosphere chamber, and the NMR tubes were sealed before being removed from the chamber. The final protein concentration in all samples was ∼1mm. NMR samples contained 10% (v/v) 2H2O for NMR spectrometer lock. To investigate the interaction of MNK3 with HAH1, we titrated the latter protein in a solution containing apo-MNK3 and equimolar copper(I) directly in the NMR tube under N2 atmosphere up to a 1:3 MNK3:HAH1 ratio. The concentration of MNK3 was around 0.3 mm. NMR Experiments and Structure Calculations—NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Avance 900, 800, and 500 Bruker spectrometers equipped with triple resonance cryoprobes. The NMR experiments used for the assignment of backbone and aliphatic side chain resonances are summarized in supplemental Table S1. For apo-MNK3, all residues in the ATP7A domain (i.e. not taking into account the engineered expression tag) were assigned, with the sole exceptions of Ser-16 and Gln-29. In copper(I)-MNK3, all residues in the ATP7A domain were assigned, except His-13, Cys-14, Gln-29, and Ser-51. Resonance assignments are reported as supplemental information (Tables S2 and S3). Structure calculations were performed with the software package ATNOS/CANDID/CYANA, using as input the amino acid sequence, the chemical shift lists, and three [1H,1H]NOE experiments, all recorded at 900 MHz with a mixing time of 110 ms: two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 13C-resolved NOESY, and three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY. The standard protocol, with seven cycles of peak picking using ATNOS (29Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), NOE assignment with CANDID (30Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar), and structure calculation with CYANA-2.1 (31Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar), was applied. φ and ψ dihedral angle constraints were derived from the chemical shift index (32Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). In each ATNOS/CANDID cycle, the angle constraints were combined with the updated NOE upper distance constraints in the input for the subsequent CYANA-2.1 structure calculation cycle. In the seventh ATNOS/CANDID/CYANA cycle, a total of 4068 NOE cross-peaks were assigned from 4631 peaks picked in the spectra of apo-MNK3, which yielded 1456 meaningful NOE upper distance limits. A total of 2865 NOE cross-peaks were assigned from 3357 peaks picked in the spectra of copper(I)-MNK3, which yielded 1011 meaningful NOE upper distance limits. The 30 conformers with the lowest residual target function values were subjected to restrained energy minimization with AMBER 8.0 (33Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J.

University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). NOE and torsion angle constraints were applied with force constants of 32 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 32 kcal mol-1 radians-2, respectively. The quality of the structures was evaluated using the program PROCHECK-NMR (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4471) Google Scholar). Structure visualization was done with the program MOLMOL (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) were recorded at 298 K at 500 MHz using a protein concentration of 0.70 mm for both apo- and copper(I)-MNK3. R1 and R2 measurements for copper(I)-MNK3 were repeated also at 0.15 mm protein concentration. R1 and R2 relaxation rates were obtained by fitting the cross-peak volumes (I), measured as a function of the relaxation delay, to a single exponential decay by using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as described in the literature (38Mandel M.A. Akke M. Palmer A.G. II I J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Uncertainties had been evaluated by using a Monte Carlo approach (38Mandel M.A. Akke M. Palmer A.G. II I J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear NOE values were calculated as the ratio of peak volumes in spectra recorded with and without saturation. Protein Production—WT-MNK3 samples were not stable over a multi-day time frame and at the relatively high concentration needed for NMR. To improve the behavior of the protein, the K46V mutation was introduced. The rationale for introducing this particular mutation was based on both energetic considerations (obtained from the program PROSAII (39Sippl M.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar)) and on the inspection of multiple domain alignments, similar to what was done previously for B. subtilis CopA (40Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Gonnelli L. Su X.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mutation was intended to make the folded form of MNK3 more compact, thus preventing the formation of insoluble aggregates. Introduction of a Val residue at position 46 resulted in a tighter packing of side chains at the exposed face of the β-sheet. K46V-MNK3 showed essentially the same spectral properties as WT-MNK3 and, in particular, essentially superimposable 1H-15N HSQC spectra (except for the mutated amino acid and immediate sequence neighbors). On the other hand, the stability of K46V-MNK3 was somewhat higher than that of WT-MNK3. Hereafter, we will refer to K46V-MNK3 as MNK3. Metallation of MNK3 was carried out by adding Cu(CH3CN) +4 to solutions of the apoprotein reduced with DTT after removal of the reductant by means of a desalting column. DTT at millimolar concentration removed copper(I) from the metal-binding site of MNK3 (Fig. 1). This was at variance with what was observed for the other metal-binding domains of the Menkes protein (26Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), where there was no observable effect of DTT on copper(I)-binding by the protein. 10 mm glutathione, which is close to what is present in vivo, did not interfere with metal binding by MNK3 (Fig. 1). MNK3 could be metallated by an excess of copper(I)-HAH1 (Fig. 2). The ratio of the integrals of selected well resolved signals from apo- and copper(I)-MNK3 examined at various MNK3:HAH1 ratios allowed us to estimate an equilibrium constant for the metal transfer process from the metallochaperone to MNK3 of 0.06 ± 0.03, indicating that HAH1 actually has a higher affinity for copper(I) than MNK3. This equilibrium constant compares with values ranging between 5 and 10 for the other Menkes domains (26Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A.

The assigned NOE signals are converted to upper distance constraints and combined with the other constraints in the input for structure calculations. After restrained energy minimization with the AMBER 8.0 program, the final bundle of 30 conformers of apo-MNK3 had an average (over all conformers) for the target function of 0.89 ± 0.02 Å2 (CYANA units), and the corresponding value for the copper(I)-MNK3 bundle of 30 conformers was 0.88 ± 0.03 Å2. The average backbone r.m.s.d. values (over residues 2-75) for the apo- and copper(I)-MNK3 structures were, respectively, 0.51 ± 0.07 Å and 0.75 ± 0.13 Å; the all heavy atoms r.m.s.d. values are, respectively, 0.92 ± 0.06 Å and 1.22 ± 0.15 Å. Per residue r.m.s.d. values are shown in supplemental Fig. S1 for apo and copper(I)-MNK3. Table 1 reports some statistics on constraint violations in the final families, together with selected quality parameters from a PROCHECK-NMR (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W.

These data indicate that the solution structures obtained for both apo- and copper(I)-MNK3 are of good quality. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the two structures. It can be seen that the largest structural changes upon metal binding occur in the loop regions, including the metal-binding loop, and at the domain termini. In addition, helix α1, which immediately follows the metal-binding loop, is shorter in copper(I)-than in apo-MNK3.TABLE 1Statistical analysis of the energy-minimized structures of apo- and copper(I)-MNK3Apo-MNK3Copper(I)-MNK3No. of meaningful constraints for each classTotal number of NOE upper distance limits14561047Intra-residue341313Inter-residueSequential (|i - j| = 1)400306Medium range (|i - j| ≤ 4)246130Long range (|i - j| ≥ 5)469298Total dihedral angle restraints134143Phi4047Psi9496r.m.s. violations per meaningful distance constraint (Å)aThe data are calculated over the 30 conformers representing the NMR structure.

Open table in a new tab The dynamic properties of apo-MNK3 and copper(I)-MNK3 have been directly sampled through 15N relaxation measurements (41Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). When comparing relaxation data at 0.7 mm concentration, there is no clear trend in the variation of R1 rates between the two forms, whereas the R2 rates in copper(I)-MNK3 are slightly higher than in apo-MNK3 all over the protein sequence (Fig. 4). Similar to the R1 rates, the difference of 15N{1H}NOEs between copper(I)- and apo-MNK3 does not show a significant trend (supplemental Fig. S2). These data suggest that upon metal binding, MNK3 experiences more pronounced conformational exchange equilibria than in the apo form. To rule out possible nonspecific protein aggregation in copper(I)-MNK3, leading to a generalized increase of R2, we repeated the measurements after 5-fold dilution and found no significant change (within experimental error) in the 15N relaxation rates (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). The third metal-binding domain of the human Menkes protein (ATP7A) has been overexpressed and subjected to NMR structural studies in both the apo- and copper(I)-loaded forms. The overall fold of the protein was unaffected by copper(I) binding, as observed previously for all other ATP7A domains (27Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. D'Onofrio M. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the conformation of the metal-binding loop and of its neighboring residues was significantly affected by the presence of the metal ion. Indeed, it was observed that helix α1 is particularly long in apo-MNK3 with respect to the other ATP7A domains, starting from the residue preceding the second (in sequence) metal-binding cysteine. To bind the metal ion, the loop conformation then must rearrange in order to allow the side chains of the two cysteines to achieve the appropriate coordination geometry; this results also in partial unwinding of the helix α1, which is confirmed by the disappearance of the corresponding NOE pattern. In addition, at the other end of the metal-binding loop, the structural rearrangement upon metal binding causes a shortening also of the β-strand preceding the loop (β1). This results also in the shortening of strand β4, which faces β1 (Fig. 2). These effects are also associated with some enhancement in protein mobility, which can be related to the onset of chemical equilibria involving different conformations for the protein backbone. These equilibria could also be partly responsible for the lower number of NOEs detected for copper(I)-MNK3 when compared with apo-MNK3. Comparison of apo-MNK3 with Enterococcus hirae apo-CopZ (13Wimmer R. Herrmann T. Solioz M. Wüthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22597-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reveals a close coincidence of the polypeptide fold, similar to what has been found for other proteins and domains of these two classes. Residues 4-66 and 70-75 of MNK3 can be superimposed onto residues 1-62 and 63-68, respectively, of E. hirae CopZ (1-68) with a global r.m.s.d. value of 1.8 Å calculated for the backbone heavy atoms, although the sequence identity is only 25%. Furthermore, in both proteins the binding of Cu(I) leads to increased disorder, albeit without greatly affecting the global fold. An apparent difference in the behavior of the two proteins upon interaction with Cu(I) is that CopZ shows a tendency of self-aggregation (13Wimmer R. Herrmann T. Solioz M. Wüthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22597-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas there is no indication of Cu(I)-induced aggregation in MNK3. The lower affinity of MNK3 for copper(I), highlighted by the inhibitory effect of DTT on metal binding (Fig. 1) and by the unfavorable thermodynamics of metal transfer from HAH1 (Fig. 2), seems to be the result of the energetically unfavorable reduction of the percentage of residues in regular secondary structure elements that takes place in concert with the necessary conformational rearrangement of the metal-binding loop. This effect proved destabilizing for the entire structure, as suggested by the analysis of protein dynamics (see above). MNK3 accepts copper(I) from its physiological partner, HAH1, without detectable formation of a metalbridged adduct, as has been observed for the yeast homologous systems (20Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or for the fourth domain of the ATP7B protein (42Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Binding of the copper(I) ion by HAH1 is tighter than by MNK3 (Fig. 2), as indicted by the low value of the equilibrium constant for the transfer process. If the amino acid sequences of the six metal-binding domains of ATP7A are aligned, it is found that MNK3 features the lowest similarity to the other five domains (12Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Molteni E. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). When inspecting the sequences of the various ATP7A homologs across various mammalian organisms, it can be observed that the third domains are closest in sequence to one another. In particular, in the loop that precedes the last β-strand and is in contact with the metal-binding loop, Phe, which is conserved in all other domains, is substituted by Pro-66. The sequence position of Pro-66 corresponds to the C terminus of helix α2 in the homologous proteins, which typically comprises residues 54-65 (numbering of the present protein). The occurrence of Pro-66 makes the helix shorter (because the Pro lacks the amide proton to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of residue 62). As an example, Fig. 5 shows a superposition of MNK3 and MNK6. In the other ATP7A domains, it is found that Phe-66 is part of a network of hydrophobic contacts involving also the conserved Met located two residues before the metal-binding loop, the second metal-binding Cys, and a conserved Leu in loop III (27Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. D'Onofrio M. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This core is present also in MNK3, where Tyr-69 plays the role of the missing Phe even though it is located three positions closer to the C terminus. In the other ATP7A domains, residue 69 is quite variable but always constitutes the second residue in the last strand of the β-sheet (β4). This is true even for the second domain, where there is a Phe at this position, in which the side chain is forcedly solvent-exposed to permit formation of the β-strand (28Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. D'Onofrio M. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Instead, in MNK3 the energetic driving force for formation of the hydrophobic core behind the metal-binding loop, which requires the participation of the side chain of Tyr-69, is such that the backbone of Tyr-69 cannot position itself to be part of the β-sheet (Fig. 5). The loop between helix α2 and strand β4 (loop V) is thus particularly long, as the helix is shorter than in the other domains and the strand is shifted toward the C terminus of the sequence, making its structure quite different from what is observed in all other ATP7A domains. Notably, predictions of domain boundaries based on multiple domain sequence alignments (12Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Molteni E. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) locate the C terminus of the MNK3 domain within strand β4 rather than after its end, because of the shift of this strand along the sequence. Notwithstanding its small size, strand β4 appears to be particularly important with respect to the stability of the entire domain structure. In fact, in human MNK6 a mutation within this strand causes a destabilization of the β-sheet, resulting in enhanced solvent accessibility of the protein backbone and higher sensitivity to the presence of denaturants, which might contribute to the onset of Menkes disease (27Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In conclusion, MNK3 presents several unexpected peculiarities with respect to the other five domains of ATP7A, which have been structurally characterized already (26Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol.

These differences are likely caused by the differences in sequence that are characteristics of the third domain. The structure, the dynamics, and the metal-binding properties of the protein are all affected, making MNK3 the worst site within the cytoplasmic tail of ATP7A for receiving copper(I) from the physiological partner. In the context of the entire ATP7A protein, metal binding is known to affect interdomain contacts, providing a possible mechanism to trigger ATP7A relocalization from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane in the presence of excess copper (23Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Chasapis C. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The unique features of MNK3, which are maintained in all mammalian homologs of human ATP7A, may constitute a further contribution to tuning this mechanism. Given its comparatively low affinity for copper(I), on thermodynamic grounds MNK3 would be the last domain to be metallated (note that the presence of glutathione at a concentration around physiological values did not prevent copper(I) binding, indicating that MNK3 can be metallated in vivo). Metallation of MNK3 could thus be an event quite suited to signal high intracellular copper(I) concentration and could trigger the appropriate response(s). Download .pdf (.56 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2047052932,"The physiological success of fluid-secreting tissues relies on a regulated interplay between Ca2+-activated Cl– and K+ channels. Parotid acinar cells express two types of Ca2+-activated K+ channels: intermediate conductance IK1 channels and maxi-K channels. The IK1 channel is encoded by the KCa3.1 gene, and the KCa1.1 gene is a likely candidate for the maxi-K channel. To confirm the genetic identity of the maxi-K channel and to probe its specific roles, we studied parotid glands in mice with the KCa1.1 gene ablated. Parotid acinar cells from these animals lacked maxi-K channels, confirming their genetic identity. The stimulated parotid gland fluid secretion rate was normal, but the sodium and potassium content of the secreted fluid was altered. In addition, we found that the regulatory volume decrease in acinar cells was substantially impaired in KCa1.1-null animals. We examined fluid secretion from animals with both K+ channel genes deleted. The secretion rate was severely reduced, and the ion content of the secreted fluid was significantly changed. We measured the membrane potentials of acinar cells from wild-type mice and from animals with either or both K+ channel genes ablated. They revealed that the observed functional effects on fluid secretion reflected alterations in cell membrane voltage. Our findings show that the maxi-K channels are critical for the regulatory volume decrease in these cells and that they play an important role in the sodium uptake and potassium secretion process in the ducts of these fluid-secreting salivary glands.

Our findings show that the maxi-K channels are critical for the regulatory volume decrease in these cells and that they play an important role in the sodium uptake and potassium secretion process in the ducts of these fluid-secreting salivary glands. In salivary glands, as in other secretory epithelia, muscarinic stimulation increases intracellular Ca2+, which activates the anion channels that drive fluid secretion. The activated anion channels allow an efflux of Cl– ions from the acinar cells into the lumen of the gland. This Cl– efflux generates a lumen negative voltage gradient sufficient to drive sodium ions into the lumen via a paracellular pathway. The net result is the secretion of sodium and chloride, with water following osmotically. For the fluid secretion process to be sustained, an apical cell driving force for Cl– efflux must be maintained. This is accomplished by the hyperpolarizing influence of acinar cell K+ channels activated by intracellular Ca2+ (1Petersen O.H. Maruyama Y. Nature. 1984; 307: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Two types of Ca2+-activated K+ channels are expressed in parotid acinar cells: a voltage-independent channel of “intermediate” single channel conductance (IK1) and a large conductance K+ channel (maxi-K) that is gated by voltage as well as by Ca2+ (2Maruyama Y. Nishiyama A. Teshima T. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1986; 36: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 3Wegman E.A. Ishikawa T. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Am. J.

In addition to their biophysical properties, these two types of channels can be distinguished by their pharmacological footprints. For example, IK1 channels are specifically inhibited by clotrimazole (7Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11651-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 8Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A PCR screen of mouse parotid acinar cells revealed two candidate genes for encoding these two K+ channels: KCa1.1 (also know as Kcnma1) and KCa3.1 (Kcnn4) (10Nehrke K. Quinn C.C. Begenisich T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C535-C546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of these two genes produces channels with the biophysical and pharmacological profiles of the native maxi-K and IK1 channels (10Nehrke K. Quinn C.C. Begenisich T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C535-C546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although these results provide strong circumstantial evidence for the genetic identification of the parotid K+ channels, gene ablation studies would be definitive and help to uncover the physiological roles of these channels. Ablation of the KCa3.1 gene eliminates expression of IK1 channels, confirming the molecular identity of the IK1 channel (11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, parotid fluid secretion from KCa3.1(–/–) mice is normal, perhaps because the remaining maxi-K channels are sufficient to maintain the necessary Cl– driving force and, hence, fluid secretion. In addition to their ability to regulate fluid secretion, parotid acinar cells, like many other cells, also dynamically regulate their cell volume: a decrease in extracellular osmolality causes the cells to swell, as expected, but also activates K+ and Cl– channels. The resulting efflux of these ions reduces cell volume to near the initial resting value. The ion channels responsible for this regulatory volume decrease (RVD) 3The abbreviations used are: RVD, regulatory volume decrease; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; CCh, carbachol; pF, picofarads. generally include both K+ and Cl– channels, but the specific types vary among different cells (reviewed in Ref. 12Wehner F. Olsen H. Tinel H. Kinne-Saffran E. Kinne R.K. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 148: 1-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of the K+ channels involved in RVD is known for some cell types. For example, IK1 channels (encoded by the KCa3.1 gene) are required for erythrocyte and T-lymphocyte RVD (11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and maxi-K channels participate in RVD in lacrimal cells (13Park K.P. Beck J.S. Douglas I.J. Brown P.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), osteoblast-like cells (14Weskamp M. Seidl W. Grissmer S. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 178: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and a bronchial epithelial cell line (15Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The channels relevant for RVD in parotid acinar cells are not known. Ablation of the KCa3.1 gene has no effect on RVD in parotid acinar cells; however, inhibition of maxi-K channels by the specific antagonist paxilline substantially inhibits RVD, suggesting that this channel is required for RVD in these cells (11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As noted above, gene ablation studies confirmed that KCa3.1 encodes the IK1 channel and showed that KCa3.1(–/–) mice have normal parotid gland fluid secretion and normal RVD in their parotid acinar cells. To confirm the molecular identity of the maxi-K channel and to probe its physiological roles, we studied mice in which the KCa1.1 gene was ablated (16Meredith A.L. Thorneloe K.S. Werner M.E. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36746-36752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Parotid acinar cells from these animals lacked the time- and voltage-dependent, Ca2+-activated maxi-K channel currents, confirming that these channels are indeed encoded by the KCa1.1 gene. Stimulated fluid secretion from the parotid glands of these animals was normal, but there were significant changes in the sodium and potassium content of the secreted fluid. RVD in KCa1.1-null mice was substantially impaired. Fluid secretion from animals with both K+ channel genes deleted was severely reduced and accompanied by quite large alterations in the ion content of the secreted fluid. The functional effects on fluid secretion from the various gene-ablated animals correlated well with alterations in parotid acinar cell membrane potential levels. These results highlight the respective physiological roles of the Ca2+-activated K+ channels in fluid-secreting salivary glands. Mouse Strains—Several strains of mice were used, including three with one or more Ca2+-activated K+ channel genes deleted. The KCa1.1(–/–) mice (16Meredith A.L. Thorneloe K.S. Werner M.E. Nelson M.T.

Our generation of KCa3.1(–/–) mice has been described previously (11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and has been maintained on a C57BL/6J background. Control animals used in experiments on KCa3.1(–/–) and KCa1.1(–/–) mice were age- and sex-matched wild-type littermates of the same background. Double knock-out mice were generated by heterozygous crossing, yielding both KCa1.1(–/–)KCa3.1(–/–) and wild-type littermates on a mixed genetic background of FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J. Control animals for experiments on double knock-out mice were wild-type littermates on this mixed background. Acinar Cell Preparation—Acinar cells were obtained by enzyme digestion as we described previously (10Nehrke K. Quinn C.C. Begenisich T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C535-C546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with some small modifications. In brief, mice were anesthetized by exposure to CO2 gas and killed by exsanguination via cardiac puncture. The parotid glands were dispersed in digestion buffer (Eagle's minimal essential medium (Biofluid Inc.), 0.17 mg/ml Liberase RI enzyme (Roche Applied Science), 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mml-glutamine) at 35–37 °C. Parotid tissue was minced ∼300 times with fine scissors in digestion buffer and incubated for 20 min. Cells were dispersed by pipetting every 10 min, followed by rinsing with Eagle's basal medium and 1% bovine serum albumin. To obtain single cells, the minced tissue was initially incubated in digestion buffer containing 0.1% trypsin and 5 mm EDTA for 5 min and then further digested as described above in the presence of 0.2% trypsin inhibitor. Cell Volume Measurement—For cell volume measurements, we followed the method described by Schreiber et al. (17Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and additional details of our implementation of this technique have been described by Krane et al. (18Krane C.M. Melvin J.E. Nguyen H.V. Richardson L. Towne J.E. Doetschman T. Menon A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23413-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Isolated acinar cells were incubated with 2 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester in Eagle's basal medium and 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min and then washed twice. Cells were attached to a coverslip on the base of a 500-μl chamber and perfused with bicarbonate-free physiological salt solution containing 110 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium gluconate, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH) at room temperature (20–22 °C). The hypotonic shock solution was made by adding a 30% volume of distilled water to this solution. The perfusion chamber was mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 200) interfaced with a fluorescence imaging system (TILL Photonics) and perfused at 3 ml/min. An x-y area of the two-dimensional image was circumscribed within individual acini using the TILL Photonics software. Fluorescence images were collected at 10-s intervals using 20-ms exposures at 490-nm excitation and 530-nm emission wavelengths. Cell volume changes were expressed as a reciprocal of the fluorescence normalized to unity just before the change in osmolality. In Vivo Saliva Collection—Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) prior to isolating the ducts from the left and right parotid glands using a dissecting microscope. The trachea was exposed and incised to ensure a patent airway during the experiment. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a regulated blanket (Harvard Apparatus). The cut ends of the ducts were inserted into individual calibrated glass capillary tubes (VWR). Secretion was stimulated by intraperitoneal injection of secretagogues. Saliva was collected for 30 min and stored at –86 °C. At the end of the saliva collection period, parotid glands were removed and carefully trimmed of connective tissue under a dissecting microscope before weighing. Immediately after parotid removal, the mice were killed by cardiac puncture. The flow rate was normalized to gland weight and expressed as μl/100 mg of gland weight. Sodium and potassium concentrations were analyzed by atomic absorption (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 3030 spectrophotometer). Chloride activity was measured using an Orion Research 940 expandable ion analyzer. Sample osmolality was obtained with a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer. Northern Blotting—Parotid glands were dissected from 3-month-old wild-type, KCa1.1-null, KCa3.1-null, and double-null mice, and the tissue was immediately frozen in liquid N2. Total RNA was extracted from ∼20 mg of tissue using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100 μg of total RNA was further purified to mRNA by chromatography on oligo(dT) resin using an Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). The recovered mRNA (∼1 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted on BrightStar-Plus positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) using 10× SSC buffer. Blots were UV-cross-linked, prehybridized with Church buffer for 60 min at 65 °C, and then hybridized overnight at 65 °C with the same buffer using gene-specific probes. Probes were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers and KCa 1.1 clones (GenBank™ accession number CB055960): 5′-ATGCAGTTTGATGACAGCATCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGATCACCATAACAACCACCA-3′ (reverse). The housekeeping ribosomal protein L32 (accession number NM_172086) was used to normalize gel loading. An L32 probe was generated by PCR using parotid cDNA and the following L32-specific primers: 5′-TTCATCAGGCACCAGTCAGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACACAAGCCATCTACTCATTTTCTTCG-3′ (reverse). Probes were labeled using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) and purified with Centri·Sep columns (Princeton Separations, Inc., Adelphia, NJ). Marker sizes are based on 18 S and 28 S mRNA bands (1.9 and 4.7 kb, respectively). The KCa1.1 blot was exposed to Eastman Kodak imaging film for 3 days. The membrane was then stripped with boiling 0.5% SDS and reprobed with L32, and the 6-h exposure was overlaid with the KCa1.1 blot. Electrophysiology—Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were done at room temperature (20–22 °C) with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data acquisition was performed using a 12-bit analog/digital converter controlled by a personal computer. K+ channel currents were recorded with solutions in which almost all of the Cl– was replaced with the rather impermeant glutamate ion. The external solution consisted of 135 mm sodium glutamate, 5 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The internal solution contained 135 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mm EGTA, and 3 mm CaCl2, which established a free Ca2+ concentration of 250 nm (Ref. 19Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar; see also www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html). The measured relevant junction potential in these recordings was <4 mV, sufficiently small that no correction to membrane voltage was made. Parotid acinar cell membrane potentials were measured at room temperature (20–22 °C) with the current clamp mode of an Axopatch 200B amplifier using a Digidata 1320A digitizer running Clampex 9.2 (Axon Instruments); Clampfit 9.2 was used for analysis. These experiments utilized the perforated patch technique (20Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) with an external solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The patch electrodes were front-filled with a solution consisting of 95 mm potassium methane-sulfonate, 45 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm BAPTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and then back-filled with the same solution containing nystatin (250 μg/ml; Sigma) and the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow (2 mm; Sigma). Lucifer Yellow was used as an indicator of the integrity of the cell membrane under the patch. Cell fluorescence was monitored by epifluorescence microscopy with an enhanced green fluorescent protein filter cube. Only data from those cells in which the yellow dye was excluded from the cell interior were used. For these measurements, the bath was initially filled with the pipette solution, and with the pipette in this solution, the voltage was zeroed. After achieving a high resistance seal, the bath was perfused with the external solution. With this method, there will be an insignificant uncorrected junction potential. Cell input resistance measurements were obtained in current clamp mode. We applied 500-ms long hyperpolarizing current steps of 10 pA, measured the resulting change in membrane voltage, and computed the membrane resistance via Ohm's law. Several such measurements (usually five) were obtained over a 25-s period and averaged. The membrane potential measurements were done with Corning 8161 glass electrodes; the voltage clamp recordings were made with quartz and Corning 8161 glass. The electrodes were not fire-polished and had resistance values between 2 and 6 megaohms when filled with the recording solutions. No leak corrections were made. Pooled current data were normalized to cell size determined as cell capacitance. Most of the cells stimulated with carbachol (CCh) responded with oscillating membrane potentials (see below). Membrane potential data were recorded at 2.5 kHz, and the slowly oscillating signals (near 0.3 Hz) were resampled at 40-ms intervals. The sampled oscillating membrane voltage was averaged (omitting the initial “spike”; see below and Fig. 4) over the period of the CCh application (20–60 s). The membrane potentials of resting cells and the few that did not oscillate in CCh were averaged over a 20-s interval. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Differences between means were determined by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Along with reporting mean and S.E. values, we have included both the number of measurements and the number of mice. These are reported below or in the figure legends as appropriate. Ca2+-activated K+ Channels in Parotid Acinar Cells—As described in the Introduction, parotid acinar cells express two types of Ca2+-activated K+ channels: the time- and voltage-independent IK1 channel and a maxi-K channel that is gated by voltage as well as by Ca2+. We have shown previously that heterologously expressed KCa3.1 channels have biophysical and pharmacological properties that are indistinguishable from those of native parotid IK1 channels and that ablation of the KCa3.1 gene eliminates the IK1 channel from the parotid cells, leaving only maxi-K channels (10Nehrke K. Quinn C.C. Begenisich T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C535-C546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These findings clearly identify the IK1 channel with the KCa3.1 gene. The maxi-K channel is likely encoded by the KCa1.1 gene because RNA from this gene is expressed in parotid acinar cells, and heterologously expressed KCa1.1 channels have the same pharmacological and biophysical footprints as native maxi-K channels (10Nehrke K. Quinn C.C. Begenisich T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C535-C546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To confirm the genetic identity of the maxi-K channel, we compared the parotid acinar cell K+ currents in wild-type mice and in mice in which the KCa1.1 gene was ablated. The Northern blot in Fig. 1A demonstrates the presence and absence of transcripts from the KCa1.1 gene in wild-type (WT) and KCa1.1-null animals, respectively. If, as suspected, the time- and voltage-dependent maxi-K current is from the KCa1.1 gene, then parotid acinar cells from KCa1.1-null mice will have only the time- and voltage-independent IK1 channels. Recordings of K+ currents from a parotid acinar cell from a wild-type mouse are illustrated in Fig. 1B. As has been shown previously (11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), immediately after achieving the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp, only time- and voltage-dependent maxi-K channels were observed. Within minutes (generally 2–5 min), the time-independent IK1 channels could be observed. Fig. 1B illustrates this behavior. The insets in Fig. 1B show currents in response to a series of 40-ms voltage clamp steps recorded from a parotid acinar cell patched with a pipette solution containing Ca2+ buffered to a value of 250 nm. Immediately after achieving the whole cell configuration (Early), only time- and voltage-dependent maxi-K channels were apparent. Shortly thereafter (Later), IK1 currents developed, contributing the time-independent component seen in the raw currents. The main part of Fig. 1B shows the currents measured at the end of the 40-ms test pulses. Immediately after patch breakthrough (○), the currents were entirely from maxi-K channels and exhibited the characteristic strong outward rectification. After stable development of IK1 channel currents (▪), the current-voltage relation exhibited a relatively linear phase at negative potentials because of IK1 channels and a nonlinear outward-rectifying maxi-K contribution at more depolarized voltages. There were no currents recorded from KCa1.1-null mice immediately after patch breakthrough and only time- and voltage-independent currents later (Fig. 1C, insets). At the end of the test pulses, there were very small currents recorded early on (○) and only a linear current-voltage relation later (▪). Thus, as predicted, the voltage-gated time-dependent maxi-K currents of parotid acinar cells in wild-type mice are encoded by the KCa1.1 gene. Fig. 1D illustrates the consequences of deleting both the KCa1.1 and KCa3.1 genes: almost the complete absence of currents. The second set of recordings (Later) was made after 12 min. In other experiments, no significant currents developed even as long as 23 min after achieving whole cell mode. As expected, KCa1.1 gene transcripts were absent in the double-null mice (Fig. 1A, (–/–)(–/–)). Maxi-K current density was quantitatively estimated as the time-dependent current over a 40-ms voltage pulse to +50 mV and was 135 ± 14 pA/picofarads (pF) (14 cells from seven animals) in cells from wild-type mice. An identical analysis of KCa1.1-null and double-null mice revealed an extremely small residual current: 2.9 ± 0.6 pA/pF (11 cells from five mice) and 2.7 ± 0.25 pA/pF (nine cells from four mice), respectively. We also estimated the level of IK1 channel activity, in this case, as the amount of current at –110 mV, a voltage much too negative to allow maxi-K channel activation. Wild-type mice exhibited –48 ± 9.9 pA/pF (13 cells from six mice) of IK1 current at this potential, and the level in KCa1.1-null animals was not significantly different (p = 0.34) at –64 ± 14 pA/pF (eight cells from five mice). The current at –110 mV in the double-null mice was quite small at –1.0 ± 0.22 pA/pF (seven cells from four mice). Parotid Fluid Secretion in KCa1.1-null Mice—As noted above, we have shown previously that deletion of IK1 channels has little or no effect on in vivo fluid secretion in parotid acinar cells (11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, if IK1 channels are not important for fluid secretion, perhaps maxi-K channels are. However, the data in Fig. 2A show that fluid secretion elicited with the mixed agonist pilocarpine was not affected by ablation of the KCa1.1 gene. The normal fluid secretion observed in both KCa1.1-null and KCa3.1-null animals suggests that neither K+ channel is necessary for fluid secretion or that either one is sufficient to support normal secretion. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we crossed the KCa1.1-null and KCa3.1-null mice to ablate both K+ channel genes and tested for parotid gland fluid secretion in the double-null animals. First, however, it is important to note that this cross-breeding establishes a new wild-type strain and so may result in different fluid secretion rates. Apparently, this was the case, as this new wild-type strain exhibited a reduced fluid secretion rate (Fig. 2, A and B, compare WT data). It is not unusual for mice with different genetic backgrounds to exhibit differences in physiological function (e.g. Refs. 21Pollak D.D. John J. Scharl T. Leisch F. Schneider A. Hoeger H. Lubec G.

Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2576-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the reduced secretion rate in these back-crossed animals serves to emphasize that these double-null animals must be compared with wild-type animals of the appropriate background. Shown in Fig. 2B (○) are the fluid secretion measurements from the double-null animals. It is clear from these results that fluid secretion is significantly reduced when both the KCa1.1 and KCa3.1 genes are ablated. Thus, some kind of K+ channel is critical for fluid secretion; one or the other K+ channel must be present to support robust fluid secretion. We have shown previously that ablating the K+ channel KCa3.1 gene has a negligible effect on the ion content of the secreted fluid (11Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C.

In contrast, the data in Fig. 3 demonstrate significant changes in the ion content of saliva from the KCa1.1-null mice.

https://openalex.org/W2014874134,"The causal relationship between obesity and heart failure is broadly acknowledged; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study we investigated whether human adipocytes secrete cardioactive substances that may affect cardiomyocyte contractility. We cultivated adipocytes obtained from human white adipose tissue and incubated isolated rat adult cardiomyocytes with adipocyte-conditioned or control medium. This is the first report to demonstrate that human adipocytes exhibit cardiodepressant activity with a direct and acute effect on cardiomyocyte contraction. This adipocyte-derived negative inotropic activity directly depresses shortening amplitude as well as intracellular systolic peak Ca2+ in cardiomyocytes within a few minutes. The adipocyte-derived cardiodepressant activity was dose-dependent and was completely blunted by heating or by trypsin digestion. Filtration of adipocyte-conditioned medium based on molecular mass characterized the cardiodepressant activity at between 10 and 30 kDa. In summary, adipose tissue exerts highly potent activity with an acute depressant effect directly on cardiomyocytes, which may well contribute to increased heart failure risk in overweight patients."
https://openalex.org/W2089548892,"Calcium-activated chloride channel (CLCA) proteins were first described as a family of plasma membrane Cl– channels that could be activated by calcium. Genetic and electrophysiological studies have supported this view. The human CLCA2 protein is expressed as a 943-amino-acid precursor whose N-terminal signal sequence is removed followed by internal cleavage near amino acid position 680. Earlier investigations of transmembrane geometry suggested five membrane passes. However, analysis by the more recently derived simple modular architecture research tool algorithm predicts that a C-terminal 22-amino-acid hydrophobic segment comprises the only transmembrane pass. To resolve this question, we raised an antibody against hCLCA2 and investigated the synthesis, localization, maturation, and topology of the protein. Cell surface biotinylation and endoglycosidase H analysis revealed a 128-kDa precursor confined to the endoplasmic reticulum and a maturely glycosylated 141-kDa precursor at the cell surface by 48 h post-transfection. By 72 h, 109-kDa N-terminal and 35-kDa C-terminal cleavage products were detected at the cell surface but not in the endoplasmic reticulum. Surprisingly, however, the 109-kDa product was spontaneously shed into the medium or removed by acid washes, whereas the precursor and 35-kDa product were retained by the membrane. Two other CLCA family members, bCLCA2 and hCLCA1, also demonstrated preferential release of the N-terminal product. Transfer of the hCLCA2 C-terminal hydrophobic segment to a secreted form of green fluorescent protein was sufficient to target that protein to the plasma membrane. Together, these data indicate that hCLCA2 is mostly extracellular with only a single transmembrane segment followed by a short cytoplasmic tail and is itself unlikely to form a channel.

Extensive analysis of cDNA and protein products of the 903-amino-acid bovine archetype Lu-ECAM-1/bCLCA2 revealed two cleavage sites, one following the 21-amino-acid N-terminal signal sequence and the other preceding amino acid 703 (2Elble R.C.

The latter converted the 120-kDa precursor glycoprotein into 90-kDa N-terminal and 35-kDa C-terminal products, apparently at the cell surface (2Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M.

For example, cleavage of hCLCA2 produces a deglycosylated product of 75 kDa, consistent with cleavage near amino acid position 680 (10Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H-Li. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane topology of ion channels is difficult to predict due to the inclusion of charged residues in the ion-conductive pore. Cunningham et al. (1Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol.

Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). However, subsequent biochemical and molecular analyses of hCLCA1 supported this model. Epitope tagging coupled with immunocytochemistry on nonpermeabilized cells suggested that certain segments were internal (9Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H-Li. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies of hCLCA2 glycosylation site utilization and protease protection analysis of in vitro translation products were consistent with five transmembrane passes for this distantly related protein (10Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H-Li. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a major shortcoming of these models, pointed out by Whittaker and Hynes (23Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 10: 3369-3387Crossref Google Scholar), is the prediction of transmembrane passes within a von Willebrand A protein-protein interaction domain, leading them to propose only one C-terminal transmembrane segment for hCLCA2. In addition, Gibson et al. (24Gibson A. Lewis A.P. Affleck K. Meldrum E. Thompson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27205-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the N-terminal processing product of the distantly related hCLCA1 can be readily removed from the cell surface, suggesting that it lacks any transmembrane segment. To resolve these issues, we raised an antibody against hCLCA2 and investigated the synthesis, localization, maturation, and topology of the protein. We report here that the hCLCA2 N-terminal processing product is peripherally associated with the plasma membrane but that the C-terminal product is integral. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that such a protein can itself form a channel, these results militate against that possibility. Bioinformatics—Analysis of hCLCA2 and other CLCA proteins was performed using the simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) software package (25Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T.

Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose fractions were used for immunoprecipitation, and peptide affinity-purified fractions were used for immunoblotting. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was produced from the hybridoma (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Anti-β4 integrin H101 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-tubulin from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-Lu-ECAM-1 6D3 and CU8 have been described previously (2Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D.

Secondary antibodies donkey anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Invitrogen. DNAs and Transfection—pcDNA3.1 clones of hCLCA2, hCLCA2-Myc, hCLCA1-Myc, and RcCMV-β4 have been described previously (9Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H-Li. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U.

Immunoprecipitation—Cells were scraped from 10-cm plates into 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 units/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation, the lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h followed by incubation with the appropriate antibodies overnight. The medium collected from the plates was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min to remove vesicles and debris. After preclearing, antibodies were added directly to 5 ml of medium. The bound proteins were recovered by incubating for 2 h with protein A beads. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and then heated in sample buffer at 95 °C for 4 min. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblots—High molecular weight proteins were analyzed on Prosieve gels (Pierce) run in Tris-glycine buffer for exceptional resolution, and low molecular weight proteins were analyzed on 10 or 14% acrylamide. The gels were blotted electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked in 5% milk dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Antibody incubation was overnight followed by a 2-h incubation with secondary antibodies and development with West Pico reagent (Pierce). Size markers included prestained ladder 7B (Sigma), unstained ladder, and Magic Mark (Invitrogen). Molecular weights were calculated using Alpha Imager software (Alpha Innotech). Deglycosylation—Immunoprecipitates collected on protein A beads were denatured and incubated with either PNGase F or endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Glyko) as directed by the manufacturer. Surface Biotinylation—Transfected cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 0.1 mg/ml sulfonated biotin (LHS-SS-Long Arm (Pierce) or Long-Arm-NHS (Vector Laboratories)), and then quenched with 50 mm ammonium chloride containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were scraped, lysed, and analyzed as described above. Blots were probed with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). To ensure that biotin labeling was specific for the cell surface, the cell lysates were treated with avidinagarose beads (Sigma), and precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of tubulin. Acid Release—Cells were treated as described by Gibson et al. (24Gibson A. Lewis A.P. Affleck K. Meldrum E. Thompson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27205-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed from a 10-cm dish by pipetting with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cell pellets were resuspended in either PBS, pH 7.5 or 0.9% NaCl equilibrated to pH 2.5 with acetic acid. The cells were rotated end-over-end for 20 min at 4 °C and then collected by brief centrifugation. The supernatants were spun at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove vesicles and membrane fragments and then subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Precipitates were resuspended in 0.1 ml of sample buffer plus 10 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and heated prior to electrophoresis. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Chimeras—To direct GFP to the ER, the cleavable 24-amino-acid signal sequence from hCLCA2 (MTQRSIAGPICNLKFVTLLVALSS) was added to the N terminus by PCR. The initial M codon of GFP was converted to N, creating an N-glycosylation site. In addition, a Myc epitope tag was inserted after the signal sequence, although the tag was not utilized in this study. After verifying the sequence of a GEM-T clone (Promega), the insert was transferred to pcDNA3.1Zeo (pSS-GFP). To test the ability of the C-terminal hydrophobic segment of hCLCA2 to direct the protein to the plasma membrane, that sequence (LILKGVLTAMGLIGIICLIIVVTHHTL) was added to the last residue of GFP followed by a termination codon (pSS-GFP-Pho). 293T cells were transfected with these plasmids or a control encoding GFP (Pinco) (35Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar) and then surface-biotinylated 48 h later. Proteins were immunoprecipitated and detected by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam). The blot was then stripped and treated as described above for detection of surface biotinylation. For confocal microscopy, transfected cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Coverslips were mounted onto slides in ProLong mounting medium (Molecular Probes). GFP fluorescence was detected with an argon laser (Olympus), and central focal planes of the cells were observed and photographed with a 100× objective. To test the hCLCA1 C terminus, its last 28 amino acids were appended to secreted GFP. Topology Prediction—The transmembrane topology of hCLCA2 was investigated using the TMHMM2 program of SMART (25Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). After the N-terminal signal peptide, only a single C-terminal transmembrane pass of 22 amino acids was predicted, spanning residues 906–928 of 943 (Fig. 1A). The predicted protein is almost entirely extracellular, with only a 15-amino-acid tail. Hence, upon cleavage, only the C-terminal processing product would be integral to the membrane (Fig. 1A). Other programs employing strict criteria for transmembrane segments (a transfer energy of 20 kcal/mol (22Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar)), such as HMMTOP and SOSUI, agree with this prediction, differing only in the limits of the segment (data not shown). However, TopPred, TMPred, and DAS employ more relaxed criteria and allow for three, four, or five transmembrane segments, respectively (data not shown). Processing and Association—An antibody (H2A) was raised against a peptide spanning amino acids 643–656 in the N-terminal processing product (Fig. 1) (33Connon C.J. Yamasaki K. Kawasaki S. Quantock A.J. Koizumi N. Kinoshita S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To characterize the antibody and to confirm the previously reported behavior of hCLCA2, H2A was used to immunoprecipitate hCLCA2 from the lysates of 293T cells transfected with hCLCA2 bearing a Myc tag near the C terminus at amino acid 725 (Fig. 1) (10Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H-Li. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with H2A detected three major species of 141, 128, and 109 kDa, whereas anti-Myc antibody 9E10 detected only the 141- and 128-kDa species, implying that the 109-kDa species must represent the N-terminal processing product (Fig. 2A). To detect the C-terminal processing product, H2A and 9E10 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with 9E10 antibody. A 35-kDa band was detected in both immunoprecipitates, indicating that the 35-kDa product remains associated with the 109-kDa product for a time following cleavage (Fig. 2B). H2A did not detect the 35-kDa protein when the blot was reprobed, demonstrating its specificity for the N-terminal product (data not shown). A schematic interpretation of these data is presented in Fig. 1B. Ectodomain Shedding—To test whether the N-terminal 109-kDa cleavage product really lacked a transmembrane segment, medium from transfected cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation and blotting with H2A. The 109-kDa product, but not the precursors, was detected in the medium, indicating that the product is devoid of transmembrane segments and that cleavage of the precursor removes a C-terminal transmembrane anchor (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this model, the 35-kDa product was not detected in the medium (Fig. 3B). Endo H Analysis and Surface Biotinylation—An alternative explanation for the lack of precursor shedding is that the precursors might never reach the cell surface. To determine whether the precursor species were present on the cell surface, endoglycosidases were employed to characterize their glycosylation profiles. Endo H recognizes and removes only immature high-mannose glycosylation typical of the ER, whereas cell surface proteins are fully resistant to this enzyme. PNGase F removes all glycosyl groups. To analyze the precursor species in isolation, hCLCA2 was immunoprecipitated from cells 48 h after transfection, a time by which little processing had occurred. PNGase F reduced both the 141- and 128-kDa species to 105 kDa, confirming that they are alternate glycoforms (Fig. 4A, 1st and 2nd lanes). A shift of this magnitude is consistent with the prediction of 12–14 glycosylation sites in the primary sequence (10Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H-Li. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, only the 128-kDa species was sensitive to Endo H, indicating ER retention, whereas the 141-kDa species was resistant and therefore must be a surface form (Fig. 4A, 3rd lanes). If processing occurs only at the cell surface, then the 109 kDa N-terminal processing product should be fully resistant to Endo H. To answer this question, the 109-kDa species was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate or medium 72 h post-transfection. Treatment with PNGase F reduced its apparent molecular mass to 75 kDa, consistent with a cleavage near amino acid 680, whereas Endo H had no effect (Fig. 4A, center and right panels), indicating that processing occurs only after the precursor reaches the cell surface. If the C terminus is responsible for anchoring hCLCA2 to the plasma membrane and cleavage occurs only at the surface, then the C-terminal processing product should also exist only on the cell surface. Indeed, the 35-kDa product was fully resistant to Endo H, whereas PNGase F reduced its apparent molecular mass to 30 kDa (Fig. 4B). These results were confirmed by surface biotinylation. Both the 141- and 109-kDa, but not the 128-kDa, proteins were labeled by a membrane-impermeable biotin compound (Fig. 5A). The 35-kDa product was equally susceptible to surface biotinylation as the higher molecular weight species (Fig. 5B). Acid Elution—Treating cells with a strong acid or base can distinguish between proteins bearing a true transmembrane segment and those that are only tightly associated by hydrogen bonding to another surface protein (36Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). This method had been employed to show that the N-terminal processing product of hCLCA1 lacks a transmembrane segment (22Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Here, the 109-kDa ectodomain was readily eluted from transfected cells by acid but not PBS (Fig. 6). However, neither the 141-kDa precursor nor the 35-kDa protein was eluted nor was the control, the integral membrane protein β4 integrin (Fig. 6). The Hydrophobic Segment Targets GFP to the Plasma Membrane—If the hCLCA2 C-terminal hydrophobic segment really constitutes a transmembrane segment, it should be able to direct a heterologous protein to the plasma membrane. We chose GFP as a normally cytoplasmic protein whose localization could be easily tracked. Two modifications were effected. To target GFP to the secretory compartment, a cleavable signal sequence was appended to the N terminus (Fig. 7, construct B). The putative transmembrane segment from hCLCA2 was then added to the C terminus (Fig. 7, construct C). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected and surface-biotinylated, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP. A Western blot revealed bands of the expected sizes for GFP and for the secreted, glycosylated GFP constructs (Fig. 7, center left panel). However, detection of the surface-biotinylated protein with avidin produced a band only for construct C, corresponding in mobility to the higher band detected by anti-GFP (Fig. 7, center right panel). Biotin labeling was specific for the cell surface, as evidenced by the lack of labeling of cytoplasmic GFP (Fig. 7), and an additional control protein, tubulin (data not shown). Confocal microscopy of cells transfected with construct C confirmed GFP fluorescence predominantly in the plasma membrane, whereas construct B produced a pattern consistent with targeting to the secretory compartment, and cytoplasmic GFP produced a bright uniform fluorescence (Fig. 7, bottom). Ectodomain Shedding by Other CLCAs—To address the generality of ectodomain shedding among CLCA family members and whether it occurs in cells that naturally express CLCA proteins, we examined media from bovine aortic endothelial cells for the presence of bCLCA2 (Lu-ECAM-1). Medium immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 6D3 and immunoblotted with CU8, antibodies specific for bCLCA2, revealed the presence of the 90-kDa N-terminal processing product but not the 120–130-kDa precursors (Fig. 8A) (2Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Another distant relative of hCLCA2, hCLCA1, has also been reported to shed its ectodomain into cell medium (22Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). In agreement with those results, we detected the ∼90-kDa N-terminal product; however, in contrast, we did not detect the 120-kDa precursor in the medium (Fig. 8B). Nevertheless, when we appended the C-terminal 28 amino acids of hCLCA1 to construct B above, it failed to direct the chimera to the plasma membrane, supporting the contention that hCLCA1 lacks a transmembrane segment (data not shown). Our results support the following model for hCLCA2 synthesis and processing, summarized in Fig. 9. The protein is secreted into the ER and glycosylated to form a 128-kDa precursor containing a single C-terminal transmembrane anchor. The precursor is transported to the Golgi, where glycosylation is modified and then appears on the cell surface as a 141-kDa species. This protein is then cleaved by an unknown endopeptidase activity. The processing event likely occurs at the cell surface, because the mature precursor appears on the surface, and processing products are resistant to Endo H, reflecting mature glycosylation. A less likely alternative is that the surface precursor is endocytosed, cleaved, and returned to the plasma membrane. Cleavage in itself does not result in immediate dissociation, as the 109- and 35-kDa products co-immunoprecipitate, and strong acid is required to remove the ectodomain from the cell surface. What triggers the spontaneous release of the ectodomain into the medium is unknown. In contrast, neither the 35-kDa product nor the 141-kDa precursor appears in the medium nor is acid-releasable from the plasma membrane, indicating the presence of a bona fide transmembrane segment; thus, hCLCA2 is an integral membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment as predicted by SMART analysis. In contrast to these results, a prior study of hCLCA2 transmembrane topology using both glycosylation site mutagenesis and protease sensitivity concluded that the protein contained five transmembrane segments (10Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H-Li. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first approach, glycosylation sites were mutated, and the effects were analyzed by in vitro translation into microsomes and PAGE. By this method, if the mutation causes a change in mobility relative to wild type, then the site must be extracellular. The lack of change is interpreted as evidence of a cytoplasmic localization. A weakness of this method is that potential glycosylation sites may not be used, because they are masked by protein folding, leading to a mistaken conclusion. The second approach relies on accurate interpretation of protease digestion products after in vitro translation into microsomes and digestion with a protease. However, in the absence of a panel of appropriate antibodies to aid in interpretation, results may again be misleading. All members of the CLCA protein family terminate in a hydrophobic segment, although none is as long as that of hCLCA2 and its mouse ortholog mCLCA5 (1Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K.

We also readily detected the N-terminal processing products of hCLCA1 and Lu-ECAM-1/bCLCA2 in culture media, but we were unable to detect the respective precursors. However, consistent with the conclusion of Gibson et al. (24Gibson A. Lewis A.P. Affleck K. Meldrum E. Thompson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27205-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), when we appended the C-terminal 28 amino acids of hCLCA1 to signal sequence-GFP, it failed to direct the chimera to the plasma membrane. 4V. Walia and R. C. Elble, unpublished data. The preferential release of the N-terminal product over the precursor in the apparent absence of a C-terminal transmembrane segment suggests that the C terminus of some CLCA family members must have another means of associating with the membrane, perhaps by binding tightly to widely expressed integral membrane proteins or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring. However, at least one CLCA protein, mCLCA3, does not appear to associate with the membrane at all but rather is shed directly into the cellular environment. 5L. Mundhenk and A. D. Gruber, unpublished observations. This lack of conservation of C-terminal association with the membrane reflects the deep phylogenetic divergence within the CLCA family and independent diversification within species. The functional significance of cleavage and ectodomain shedding for CLCA family members remains unknown. Ectodomain shedding has been described for a variety of cell surface proteins, including cell adhesion molecules, ectoenzymes, and growth factor receptors (37Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Its consequences are also varied. Cleavage may be a means of down-regulating the protein (as demonstrated for L-selectin) or activating it (as shown for TNFα) (38Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Kronheim S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In many cases, the responsible agents have been identified; for example, epidermal growth factor receptor ligands are released by ADAM17 metalloprotease, and this step is essential for activation of cell migration (39Sahin U.

Similarly, the hCLCA2 ectodomain may act as a diffusible signaling molecule. This possibility is especially interesting given that hCLCA2 and its mouse ortholog mCLCA5 have demonstrated tumor-suppressive activities and both are expressed in mammary epithelium (7Beckley J.R.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5488-5491PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of hCLCA2 has been observed in the mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A. 6R. C. Elble, unpublished data. On the other hand, several lines of evidence are consistent with a role in modulating chloride current across the plasma membrane. First, transfection of any CLCA cDNA into 293T or other heterologous cell types results in a calcium-stimulated chloride current across the plasma membrane (14Loewen M.E. Forsyth G.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1061-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Yamazaki J. Okamura K. Ishibashi K. Kitamura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1715: 132-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, genetic modifiers of the severity of cystic fibrosis and asthma, both secretory diseases in which chloride flux plays a prominent role, map to the CLCA gene cluster (16Kamada F. Suzuki Y. Shao C. Tamari M. Hasegawa K. Hirota T. Shimizu M. Takahashi N. Mao X.Q. Doi S. Fujiwara H. Miyatake A. Fujita K. Chiba Y. Aoki Y. Kure S. Tamura G. Shirakawa T. Matsubara Y.

The identification of interacting proteins should allow a better definition of the functions of this protein family and permit an accurate renaming."
https://openalex.org/W2075068011,"STAT transcription factors have been implicated in many biological processes, particularly host immune defense and development. Here we characterize a STAT orthologue from the nematode, C. elegans. We show that this protein, termed STA-1, is structurally and functionally related to other vertebrate and invertebrate STAT proteins, recognizing a cis DNA element conserved through phylogeny. Unexpectedly, STA-1 lacks the conserved amino-terminal oligomerization domain found in vertebrate and other invertebrate STAT proteins, a feature also lacking in orthologues from a distantly related nematode species and from the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. This absence suggests that a primordial STAT protein lacked this domain, which was accreted later in evolution to provide further regulatory control of STAT signaling. Derivation of null mutants demonstrated that STA-1 is not required for nematode viability, despite its widespread expression in multiple tissues of the worm. However, mutant STA-1 proteins that lack functional coiled-coil and DNA binding domains could still be activated and accumulated in the nucleus, suggesting that DNA binding is not a necessary prerequisite for nuclear retention of activated STAT proteins. Our results shed new light on the evolution and function of the STAT signaling pathway and on the structural requirements for STAT activation."

In this study, we identified a novel Drosophila PAPS transporter gene dPAPST2 by conducting data base searches and screening the PAPS transport activity among the putative nucleotide sugar transporter genes in Drosophila. The amino acid sequence of dPAPST2 showed 50.5 and 21.5% homology to the human PAPST2 and SLALOM, respectively. The heterologous expression of dPAPST2 in yeast revealed that the dPAPST2 protein is a PAPS transporter with an apparent Km value of 2.3 μm.

In RNA interference flies, an analysis of the genetic interaction between dPAPST2 and genes that contribute to glycosaminoglycan synthesis suggested that dPAPST2 is involved in the glycosaminoglycan synthesis and the subsequent signaling.

These results indicate that dPAPST2 may be involved in Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic signaling by controlling the sulfation of heparan sulfate. Sulfation of proteins, proteoglycans, and lipids is involved in a variety of biological phenomena. It requires certain processes that provide a donor substrate for sulfotransferases. First, the free sulfate incorporated into the cell must be converted into a high energy form of nucleotide sulfate, namely 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), 3The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; dHS6ST, Drosophila heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase; dHs3st-B, Drosophila heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase B; dOXT, Drosophila peptide O-xylosyltransferase; dβ4GalT7, Drosophilaβ1,4-galactosyltransferase 7; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; en, engrailed; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GMR, glass multiple reporter; HA, influenza hemagglutinin epitope; HS, heparan sulfate; IR, inverted repeat; mAb, monoclonal antibody; papss, PAPS synthase; RpL32, ribosomal protein L32; RNAi, RNA interference; S2, Schneider 2; sll, slalom; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. by PAPS synthases. Next, the PAPS must be translocated from the cytosol into the Golgi apparatus by PAPS transporters. These components that are involved in the PAPS providing pathways also play a crucial role in controlling the sulfation process; however, the sulfotransferases have long been believed to be the rate-limiting components (1Kamiyama S.

On the other hand, the Drosophila PAPS transporter gene sll belongs to a large family of nucleotide sugar transporters, which includes a number of putative genes. This study aimed at identifying a novel Drosophila gene involved in the sulfation pathway.

The heterologous expression of this gene in yeast revealed that the dPAPST2 protein is a novel PAPS transporter. The dPAPST2 gene interacted genetically with the following genes that are involved in the synthesis of HS: the Drosophila genes encoding β1,4-galactosyltransferase 7 (dβ4GalT7), heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (dHS6ST), heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase B (dHs3st-B), and peptide O-xylosyltransferase (dOXT) (15Kamimura K.

We performed a TBLASTN search for the amino acid sequence of the sll open reading frame and identified a Drosophila gene (GenBank™ accession number, AY069640). In order to prepare attB-flanked PCR product, the recombination sites for the GATEWAY™ cloning system (Invitrogen) were created by performing two steps of attB adaptor PCR. The first gene-specific PCR used the expression sequence tag clone LD40702 as a template for dPAPST2 amplification and the dPAPST2 primer set (forward primer, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCAGCAGAATGACCGATAATAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCAACTTCGATGAGGAATTTGC-3′). The second PCR was performed by using the products of the first PCR as the template (forward primer, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3′). The PCR amplifications were performed using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). To create an entry clone for the subsequent subcloning, the attB-flanked PCR product was cloned into the pDONR™201 vector according to the manufacturer's protocol. The entry clone was subcloned into appropriate vectors by using the GATEWAY™ cloning system according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Two hundred micrograms of the protein from each Golgi-enriched P100 membrane fraction obtained was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 μm radiolabeled substrate. After incubation, the radioactive substrate incorporated into the microsomes was trapped using a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. For each sample, the activity was calculated as the difference between the observed value and the background value obtained from the same assay at 30 °C for 0 min. Western Blot Analysis—Fifty micrograms of the protein from each sample was added to 3× SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and then incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were fractionated on a 2–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The separated proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The HA-tagged proteins were immunostained with mouse anti-HA mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb. The bound horseradish peroxidase was detected using ECLplus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The cDNA sequences of dPAPST2 (nucleotide position 446–946 of the coding sequence), dHs3st-B (nucleotide position 568–1067 of the coding sequence), sll (nucleotide position 78–577 of the coding sequence), dβ4GalT7 (nucleotide position 14–495 of the coding sequence), dHS6ST (nucleotide position 1–499 of the coding sequence), dOXT (nucleotide position 1052–1551 of the coding sequence of NM_139448), and papss (nucleotide position 139–638 of the coding sequence of NM_168824) were amplified by PCR using a cDNA library derived from Drosophila melanogaster or each expression sequence tag clone. Each PCR fragment was inserted as an inverted repeat (IR) sequence into the pSC1 vector. The IR-containing fragments were then subcloned into the transformation vector pUAST, and these vectors were introduced into Drosophila embryos of the w1118 mutant stock that were used as hosts to construct UAS-IR fly lines according to the procedure reported by Spradling (23Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. in Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1986: 175-197Google Scholar). Each line was mated with the appropriate driver fly lines, and the F1 progeny was raised at 28 °C to observe the phenotypes. Quantitative Analysis of the dPAPST2 Transcript by Real Time PCR—RNA was extracted from the third instar larvae of each fly line by using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Firststrand cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript II first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using qPCR Mastermix QuickGoldStar (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The gene-specific primer pairs and TaqMan probes that were used for each gene are as follows. For the quantitation of dPAPST2, 5′-CTCGCAGCGGAAGTCCTC-3′ forward primer, 5′-AGGTCAAAGCAAAGGATACGGA-3′ reverse primer, and the 5′-ACGTCGGAATCTCCGCCGGAA-3′ probe were used. For the quantitation of sll, 5′-GGCCCAGTTGTGTTTACGATAAT-3′ forward primer, 5′-GGTAGATGAAGCAGGAGAGCATAAT-3′ reverse primer, and the 5′-CCACCGCCTGACGCAGTGTCAT-3′ probe were used. For the quantitation of ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32), 5′-GCAAGCCCAAGGGTATCGA-3′ forward primer, 5′-CGATGTTGGGCATCAGATACTG-3′ reverse primer, and the 5′-AACAGAGTGCGTCGCCGCTTCA-3′ probe were used. The probes were labeled with a reporter dye FAM and a quencher dye TAMRA at the 5′-ends and at the 3′-ends, respectively. Relative amounts of the dPAPST2 and sll transcripts were normalized to those of the RpL32 transcripts in the same cDNA. RNAi of Cell Lines—Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for each gene was synthesized by T7 transcription. The following sequences were selected as the template DNA for transcription: dPAPST2, nucleotide position 446–946 of the coding sequence; sll, nucleotide position 78–577 of the coding sequence; and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), nucleotide position 1–500 of the coding sequence. The primers for the amplification of the transcription template DNA contained a T7 promoter sequence (GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA) that was followed by a 20-nucleotide long gene-specific sequence. The transcription template DNA was amplified by PCR, and dsRNA was synthesized using a MEGASCRIPT T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty four hours prior to the transfection, Schneider 2 (S2) cells were subcultured in 10-cm dishes at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/dish in Schneider's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected with 10 μg/ml of each dsRNA by using the Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript II first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Metabolic Labeling—Forty eight hours after transfection and 48 h prior to analysis, the cells were subcultured in 10-cm dishes at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/dish in inorganic sulfate-free Schneider's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μCi/ml carrier-free [35S]Na2SO4. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 4 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated on ice for 1 h. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used as cell lysates. Fifty micrograms of the protein in each sample was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, followed by cold acetone. The precipitate was dried and dissolved in 0.5 n NaOH for scintillation counting. Identification of dPAPST2—In order to identify a novel PAPS transporter gene, we performed a BLAST search of Drosophila data bases by using the sll gene sequence as the query sequence. We selected four Drosophila candidate genes (CG7853, CG5802, CG14511, and CG3774) that showed high homology to sll (Fig. 1A), and we cloned the open reading frame of each cDNA. On screening the PAPS transport activity, a cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number, AY069640), possessing the symbol name CG7853 in Flybase, was identified as a second member of the PAPS transporter gene family (details described below). Because the sll gene is an ortholog of the human PAPST1 gene (6Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y.

We cloned the full-length open reading frame from the expression sequence tag clone LD40702, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dPAPST2 gene contains an open reading frame of 1188 bp encoding a protein of 396 amino acids. Very recently, we found that the putative transporter gene SLC35B3 encodes a PAPS transporter in humans, and we named it PAPST2 (24Kamiyama S. Sasaki N. Goda E. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Narimatsu H.

The phylogenetic tree of Drosophila and human transporter genes (Fig. 1A) indicated that dPAPST2 is an ortholog of the human PAPST2. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of dPAPST2, SLL, human PAPST1, and human PAPST2 is shown in Fig. 1B. dPAPST2 showed 21.5 and 50.5% homology to SLL and PAPST2, respectively. A hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequences predicted that dPAPST2 is a type III transmembrane protein with nine transmembrane domains (Fig. 1B). dPAPST2 Is a Novel Drosophila PAPS Transporter Gene— The substrate specificity of the dPAPST2 protein was determined in a manner similar to that of SLL, as reported previously (6Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol.

HA-tagged dPAPST2 was inserted into the YEp352GAP-II yeast expression vector and expressed in S. cerevisiae. The HA-tagged dPAPST2 protein was detected in the yeast Golgi-enriched P100 membrane fraction (Fig. 2A). The P100 membrane fraction was used to measure the transport activity of the dPAPST2 protein for nucleotide sugars and PAPS. As shown in Fig. 2B, the dPAPST2 protein exhibited PAPS transport activity (1.7 ± 0.2 versus 3.1 ± 0.3 pmol/mg protein, respectively, mean ± S.E. from six independent experiments; p < 0.05, Student's t test). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed for other nucleotide sugars. These results suggest that the dPAPST2 protein is a PAPS-specific transporter similar to SLL. The saturated PAPS transport activity of dPAPST2 had an apparent Km value that was estimated to be 2.3 μm (Fig. 2C). Spatiotemporal Expression Profiles of dPAPST2 and sll in the Fly—The developmental expression profiles and tissue distributions of dPAPST2 and sll mRNAs were investigated by a quantitative analysis using real time PCR (Fig. 3, A and B). As shown in Fig. 3A, during development, the expressions of dPAPST2 and sll were altered in a similar manner. Both genes showed higher expression levels in the early embryonic stage than in the other stages. The tissue distributions of the dPAPST2 and sll mRNAs in third instar larvae and adult flies are shown in Fig. 3B. The dPAPST2 and sll genes showed a similar ubiquitous distribution. The expression of sll mRNA was several folds that of dPAPST2 mRNA in all the tested organs (note the different scales in the panels in Fig. 3). dPAPST2 Is Involved in the Sulfation of Cellular Proteins—To confirm whether dPAPST2 serves as a PAPS transporter in Drosophila cells, we reduced dPAPST2 expression in the Drosophila cell line S2 by using RNAi. The S2 cells were transfected with a 500-nucleotide-long dsRNA that targets the dPAPST2 or sll gene. For the negative control, we used a dsRNA that targets the EGFP gene. The cells that were treated with each dsRNA were analyzed 96 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 4A, the treatment with dPAPST2 and sll dsRNAs reduced the level of the corresponding transcript by 77 and 57%, respectively. No alteration was observed in the level of the nontarget gene transcript (Fig. 4A). Both transcripts of dPAPST2 and sll decreased in the double-knockdown cells. The PAPS transport activity in the Golgi-enriched fraction that was prepared from each knockdown cell cultures is shown in Fig. 4B. By treatment with the dPAPST2 and sll dsRNAs, the activity in the Golgi-enriched fraction decreased to 69 and 44% that of the control, respectively. The total sulfate incorporation into the cellular proteins was determined by metabolic labeling with [35S]sulfate. As shown in Fig. 4C, the radioactivity incorporated into the cellular proteins decreased in the cells treated with dPAPST2 dsRNA (79% that of the control). The double-knockdown cells showed the lowest incorporation value. These results suggest that the dPAPST2 protein acts as a PAPS transporter in Drosophila cells and thus is involved in the sulfation of cellular proteins. dPAPST2 Is an Essential Gene for the Viability of the Fly—In a previous report, we demonstrated that the function of the sll gene is essential for the viability of Drosophila (6Kamiyama S.

We constructed two UAS-dPAPST2-IR fly lines, namely UAS-dPAPST2-IR[1] and UAS-dPAPST2-IR[2]; the lines contained a UAS-controlled dPAPST2 IR transgene in chromosomes III and II, respectively. These lines were crossed with a GAL4 driver fly line, namely Act5C-GAL4, to express the yeast transcription factor GAL4 under the control of the cytoplasmic actin promoter. The F1 fly lines Act5C-GAL4/+;UAS-dPAPST2-IR[1]/+ and Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPAPST2-IR[2], respectively, are expected to induce dPAPST2 gene silencing in all cells at all developmental stages of the fly. As shown in Table 1, both the Act5C-GAL4/+;UAS-dPAPST2-IR[1]/+ and Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPAPST2-IR[2] lines exhibited semi-lethality. The efficiency of gene silencing in the third instar larvae was determined by real time PCR. The level of the dPAPST2 transcript in the Act5C-GAL4/+;UAS-dPAPST2-IR[1]/+ and Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPAPST2-IR[2] lines was only 16.6 and 19.5% that in the wild-type fly, respectively (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the level of the sll transcript in each line was not affected (91.8 and 118.8%, respectively), thereby indicating the specific silencing of dPAPST2 gene expression (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrated that dPAPST2 is a PAPS transporter gene essential for the viability of the fly, and it is not an accessory factor for the functioning of the sll gene.TABLE 1Viability of dPAPST2 RNAi fliesUAS-dPAPST2-IR fliesViability of F1aF1 progeny of each homozygous UAS-dPAPST2-IR fly crossed with the Act5C-GAL4/CyO, GFP fly.

Open table in a new tab dPAPST2 Genetically Interacts with the Drosophila dβ4GalT7 Gene in the Wing—We further investigated the biological functions of dPAPST2 in the fly. First, we crossed the UAS-dPAPST2-IR fly lines with seven GAL4-driver lines, and each of the driver lines had a different promoter that is expressed exclusively in the wing. However, no visible phenotype was detected in the wings of all tested flies. On the other hand, a papss RNAi fly line, engrailed (en)-GAL4/UAS-papss-IR showed the small-wing phenotype in the posterior compartment where en is exclusively expressed (Table 2 and Fig. 6, B and F).

To further understand the mechanisms of ER-specific regulation, we used microarray and reverse transcription-PCR analyses of E2-treated U2OS-ERα or -ERβ cells and identified retinoblastoma-binding protein 1 (RBBP1) as a major E2-regulated gene. RBBP1 is a retinoblastoma cofactor involved in the control of osteoblastic proliferation. Although RBBP1 mRNA levels rapidly increased after 2 h of E2 treatment in both U2OS-ER-expressing lines, a sustained induction was only observed in U2OS-ERα cells. Examination of the RBBP1 genomic sequence revealed an ER response element and a Sp1 site located within the first intron. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that E2-dependent ERα binding to the intron 1 enhancer region was constitutive, whereas ERβ binding was transient, consistent with the mRNA time course. Interestingly, transient transfection and receptor mutational studies revealed that RBBP1 induction by ERα only requires the Sp1 site, whereas ERβ utilizes both the Sp1 and estrogen response elements binding sites for maximal E2-dependent activation. Stable U2OS transfectants containing a deletion of the ERα activation function 1 (AF1) resulted in a temporal mRNA induction profile similar to that of wild type ERβ. Further, overexpression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses also demonstrated that E2-dependent RBBP1 induction is SRC2-dependent for both ER isoforms. These results describe an E2-dependent, ER isoform-specific transcriptional activation of the RBBP1 gene, which in part, is explained by the differential activity of ER AF1 and enhancer element binding.

Specifically, only ∼20% of all genes regulated through either ER isoform are regulated by both ER isoforms. The mechanism(s) of ER isoform-specific gene regulation are unknown; however because of the low level of homology between the ERα and ERβ A/B (AF1) domains, differences in transcriptional activation may be largely due to AF1 function (30Flototto T.

Using deletion and mutational analysis, we demonstrate that ERα utilizes a consensus Sp1 sequence, whereas ERβ functions through both the Sp1 and a nearby ERE sequence. Deletion of the ERα AF1 in a stable U2OS transfectant cell line causes the temporal profile to mimic that of wild type ERβ. These data indicate that differential transcriptional activation of RBBP1 by ERα and ERβ and transcription factor binding site utilization are AF1-dependent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Chemicals—The U2OS-ERα and -ERβ cell lines, described previously (26Monroe D.G.

Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was used to decrease amplification errors, and the resultant constructs were sequenced to ensure fidelity. The ERE and Sp1 mutations were introduced into the respective amplifying primers with the mutated sequence as seen in Fig. 5A.FIGURE 4Mutational analysis of the RBBP1 intron 1 enhancer region results in ER isoform-specific effects.

Briefly, primers were designed to mutate Glu203 and Gly204 to alanines for ERα and Glu167 and Gly168 to alanines for ERβ. The ERα double mutation was as reported previously (34Jakacka M. Ito M. Weiss J. Chien P.Y. Gehm B.D. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13615-13621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because ERα and ERβ share 97% identify within the DNA-binding domain, the same mutation was made in ERβ. Resultant products were mixed and amplified using specific flanking primers containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI and HindIII/XbaI sites of pcDNA4/TO for the ERα and ERβ P-box mutations, respectively.Development of the ER-ΔAF1 Expression Constructs and the U2OS-ER-ΔAF1 Cell Lines—Construction of the ERα-ΔAF1 and ERβ-ΔAF1 expression plasmids was performed using PCR. Briefly, primers were designed to amplify amino acids 174–595 of human ERα and amino acids 130–530 of human ERβ. An in-frame N-terminal FLAG epitope was included in the forward primers for validation of protein expression (32Monroe D.G. Johnsen S.A. Subramaniam M. Getz B.J. Khosla S. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 176: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI and HindIII/XbaI sites of pcDNA4/TO for ERα-ΔAF1 and ERβ-ΔAF1, respectively. The generation of the U2OS-ER-ΔAF1 cell lines was performed using the T-REx system (Invitrogen) as described previously (26Monroe D.G. Getz B.J. Johnsen S.A. Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The ER-ΔAF1-pcDNA4/TO vectors were linearized using a PvuI restriction digest and transfected into the U2OS-TetR cells at a density of 50% using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). 48 h later, the transfected cells were split and plated in an antibiotic-containing, selective medium. Individual cell clones were isolated and Western blot analysis performed to confirm expression of both ERα-ΔAF1 and ERβ-ΔAF1. The resulting cell lines are termed U2OS-ERα-ΔAF1 and -ERβ-ΔAF1.Transient Transfection Analyses—U2OS-ERα and U2OS-ERβ cells were plated at a density of 50% in 6-well plates. RBBP1 intron 1 enhancer constructs and ER mutant constructs were transiently transfected in triplicate using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) at a concentration of 250 ng/well in CS-FBS-containing medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml Dox for ER induction. The next day, cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 100 ng/ml Dox and either ethanol control or 10 nm E2 in serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested, and 1 μlof protein extract was assayed using luciferase assay reagent (Promega). For the SRC overexpression, 250 ng/well of SRC1 or SRC2 was cotransfected using the same procedure.Western Blot Analysis—The U2OS-ER-ΔAF1 cell lines were plated at a density of 75% in 10-cm culture dishes and treated with 100 ng/ml Dox for 24 h. Total protein extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) and the protein concentrations determined using a standard Bradford assay. ER-ΔAF1 protein levels were analyzed by Western blot using a FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSRegulation of RBBP1 by E2 in Osteoblastic Cells—Our previous microarray data demonstrated that RBBP1 was regulated 4.01-fold following 24 h of E2 treatment in the U2OS-ERα cell line, whereas no regulation was detected in the U2OS-ERβ cell line (27Monroe D.G. Secreto F.J. Subramaniam M. Getz B.J. Khosla S. Spelsberg T.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1555-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, at 2 h of E2 treatment, RBBP1 was regulated 3.74- and 2.55-fold in the U2OS-ERα and -ERβ cell lines, respectively (data not shown). To further understand the complex kinetics of RBBP1 induction by both ER isoforms, we performed an E2 time course from 0 to 24 h of treatment and determined RBBP1 mRNA induction using conventional and real-time RT-PCR analyses. As shown in Fig. 1, RBBP1 expression is induced over control levels following 24 h of E2 treatment in the U2OS-ERα cell line. However, in the U2OS-ERβ cell line, RBBP1 induction appears only transient, peaking at 2 h of E2 treatment and returning to near control levels by 8–24 h, supporting the microarray expression data. To assess whether RBBP1 is regulated in nontransformed osteoblasts, a similar analysis was conducted using mouse calvarial osteoblasts, which are known to contain significant amounts of both ER isoforms. Fig. 1A demonstrates that RBBP1 induction by E2 is sustained, indicating that RBBP1 regulation by E2 is not specific to the U2OS-ER model and is observed in normal, nontransformed osteoblasts.FIGURE 1RBBP1 is regulated by E2 in human osteoblasts. A, U2OS-ERα, U2OS-ERβ, and mouse calvarial osteoblasts (OBs) were treated for the time points indicated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for either human or mouse RBBP1 and β-actin. B, real-time RT-PCR was employed on the samples described in A with data expressed as mRNA abundance relative to β-actin. Asterisks denote significance at the p < 0.01 level (ANOVA) compared with control treatment (0 h). The experiment was repeated twice, and a representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The RBBP1 Intron 1 Enhancer Region Contains an ERE and Binds ERα and ERβ—In an effort to understand the genetic components of E2 regulation of RBBP1 gene expression, the genomic sequence of the RBBP1 gene was scanned for potential ERE-like sequences. As depicted in Fig. 2, an ERE was found within intron 1 at nucleotide +899 (relative to the transcriptional start site), which closely matched the pure ERE consensus sequence (GGTCAXXXTGACC). Interestingly, a Sp1 transcription factor binding site was also found at nucleotide +949. The core Sp1 sequence and the extended sequence perfectly match the established Sp1 consensus, (G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(C/T) (35Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A, a schematic diagram of the RBBP1 intron 1 enhancer region (+400 to +1140, relative to the transcriptional start site) is depicted.

Fig. 3 demonstrates that significant binding, in vivo, of both ERα and ERβ is observed following 1 h of E2 treatment. More specifically, ERα exhibits an E2-dependent binding to the RBBP1 intron 1 enhancer region throughout the 24-h time course, wherein ERβ displays E2-dependent binding only at 1 h of E2 treatment. It is interesting to note that ERβ binding is minimal at 2 h following E2 treatment and that the RBBP1 mRNA (see Fig. 1) does not completely decrease to near control levels until 8 h of E2 treatment, suggesting that mRNA stability is playing a role in these differential chronologies. These data are in general agreement with the RT-PCR data (Fig. 1), which suggest that the sustained increase in the expression of RBBP1 in U2OS-ERα cells and the temporary increase of RBBP1 expression in U2OS-ERβ cells correlate with and are probably dependent on ER binding to the RBBP1 intron 1 enhancer region.FIGURE 3ChIP analysis of the RBBP1 intron 1 enhancer region demonstrates ER binding. A, ChIP assays were performed in U2OS-ERα and -ERβ cell lines treated with 10 nm E2 for the indicated times using antibodies specific for either ERα or ERβ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resultant products were separated using agarose gel electrophoresis. B, real-time PCR analysis was employed on samples from three independent ChIP experiments. Asterisks denote significance at the p < 0.01 level (ANOVA) compared with control treatment (0 h) within each cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of the RBBP1 Intron 1 Enhancer Region Delineates Different Requirements for ERα and ERβ Binding and Promoter Activation—To determine the role of the ERE and neighboring trans-acting sites in E2 regulation of RBBP1 by the ER isoforms, various RBBP1 intron 1 enhancer constructs were PCR-amplified, cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, and transiently transfected in both U2OS-ERα and -ERβ cells. Both ERs activate the RBBP1 +412 to +1140 construct, which contains the ERE and Sp1 sites (Fig. 4A). Loss of the +950 to +1140 sequences, including most of the Sp1 site, completely abolished ERα-dependent activation, whereas only a slight effect was observed on ERβ-dependent activation. This suggests that the Sp1 site within this sequence is critically important for ERα- but not ERβ-dependent transcriptional activation.To specifically characterize the effects of the ERE and Sp1 sites in E2-dependent activation in the same context, mutations of the ERE and Sp1 sites, alone or in combination, were created in the +851 to +1140 context and transiently transfected in the U2OS-ER cell lines. Fig. 4B demonstrates that mutation of the Sp1 site completely abolishes E2-dependent activ"

CooA binds its target DNA sequence in response to CO binding to its heme. Activity measurements and resonance Raman (RR) spectra are reported for CooA variants that bind DNA even in the absence of CO, those in which the wild-type residues at the 121-126 positions, TSCMRT, are replaced by the residues AYLLRL or RYLLRL, and also for variants that bind DNA poorly in the presence of CO, such as L120S and L120F.

The (A/R) YLLRL variants have detectable populations of a 5-coordinate heme resulting from partial dissociation of the endogenous distal ligand, Pro-2. Selective excitation of this population reveals downshifted Fe-His-77-stretching RR bands, confirming the proximal bond weakening. These results support our previous hypothesis that the conformational change required for DNA binding is initiated by displacement of the heme into an adjacent hydrophobic cavity once CO displaces the Pro-2 ligand.

Examination of the crystal structure reveals a physical basis for these results, and a mechanism is proposed to link heme displacement to conformational change. An increasing volume of research has revealed the ubiquity of heme sensor proteins (1Gilles-Gonzalez M. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 2Uchida T. Kitagawa T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which regulate a range of biological activities in response to changing levels of the gaseous molecules CO, NO, or O2. In these proteins nature has taken advantage of the ability of heme to bind these nonpolar molecules and has coupled the elementary act of ligand binding to a change of protein activity. How this is accomplished has become a central issue in chemical biology. One of the best opportunities to probe this question is presented by the well studied molecule CooA (3Roberts G.P. Kerby R.L. Youn H. Conrad M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Aono S. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) from Rhodospirillum rubrum, which grows on CO as the sole energy source under anaerobic conditions. When bound by CO, CooA binds its target DNA sequence and activates transcription of genes coding for proteins that oxidize CO to CO2 and reduce protons to H2. CooA is a homodimer, and each 221-residue monomer contains an N-terminal heme binding domain and a C-terminal DNA binding domain. The x-ray crystal structure has been determined for the CO-free inactive state of Fe(II) CooA (5Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct.

However, CooA is homologous to another well studied transcription factor, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 4The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; RR, resonance Raman; WT, wild-type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Mb, myoglobin; 6-c, 6-coordinate. 4The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; RR, resonance Raman; WT, wild-type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Mb, myoglobin; 6-c, 6-coordinate.

Comparison of the two structures (Fig. 1) reveals similar folds for both the DNA and effector binding domains but very different domain orientations. In the symmetric structure of active CRP, the DNA binding domains are positioned near to the effector binding domains in such a way as to expose the F helices to properly interact with target DNA. In contrast, the structure of inactive CooA is asymmetric, presumably because of crystal forces (5Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The B chain has an extended structure due to a fusion of the C helix at the dimer interface with the D helix of the DNA binding domain. The A chain has a bend between the C and D helices as in active CRP, but the domain orientation is completely different. In both monomers of inactive CooA, the F helices are buried from solvent and should be inactive for DNA binding. In both CRP and CooA, the C helices are associated in a coiled-coil, and each is in contact with both effector domains. The heme groups of inactive Fe(II) CooA are ligated on one side by His-77 and on the other by the Pro-2 N terminus of the opposite chain. The Pro-2 ligands are displaced when CO binds (9Yamamoto K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35384-35393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that the displacement of Pro-2 by CO induces displacement of the hemes into adjacent hydrophobic cavities, accompanied by readjustment of the C helices. The importance of C-helix repositioning has also been shown by a substantial amount of functional analysis of variants altered in this region (16Kerby R.L. Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We now elaborate our model with further evidence including RR studies of variants that are constitutively active (active in the absence of CO) as well as other variants with low activity even in the presence of CO. In addition we suggest a mechanism for the initiation of C-helix bending required for reorientation of the DNA domains through protein tension generated by the heme displacement. Finally we present evidence that CO-bound wild-type (WT) CooA is not entirely in the “on” conformation but is in an intermediate conformation or else in an equilibrating mixture of on and off populations. The latter alternative is supported by previous kinetic measurements (17Puranik M. Nielsen S.B. Youn H. Hvitved A.N. Bourassa J.L. Case M.A. Tengroth C. Balakrishnan G. Thorsteinsson M.V. Groves J.T.

Reduction and CO binding were monitored by changes in the absorption spectra. The Fe(II) CooA samples were prepared by first purging with N2 for 20 min followed by the reduction with sodium dithionite. To increase the 5-coordinate (5-c) fraction, a buffer with higher salt concentration (25 mm MOPS, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) was used. DNA-bound Fe(II)-CO CooA was prepared according to the published procedures (19Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol.

The double-stranded DNA sample (provided by Prof. Thomas Poulos, University of California, Irvine), 5′-GCATAACTGTCATCTGGCCGACAGACGATGG-3′ and 3′-GTATTGACAGTAGACCGGCTGTCTGCTACCG-5′, was heated at 80 °C for 5 min in a water bath and then cooled at room temperature for ∼2 h. Then the annealed DNA (final concentration 15 μm) was mixed with a sample of either WT or RYLLRL CooA (final concentration 15 μm) in 40 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, buffer and incubated at room temperature for ∼30 min. The Fe(II)-CO sample was then prepared as described above. RR Spectroscopy—RR spectra were obtained with excitation wavelengths of 406.7 and 568.1 nm from a Kr+ laser (Spectra Physics, 2080-RS) and 441.6 nm from a He-Cd (Liconix) laser in a 270° backscattering sample geometry. Photodissociation of the bound CO was minimized by using low laser power (∼1 milliwatt at the sample) and by spinning the sample. The scattered light was collected and focused onto a triple spectrograph (Chromex) equipped with a CCD detector (Roper Scientific) operating at 77 K. Spectra were calibrated with dimethyl formamide, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6. In Vitro DNA Binding Analysis Identifies Variants Affected in the Heme Vicinity with a Range of Activities—To explore the connection between ligand binding and protein conformation change, a set of CooA variants was chosen with substitutions predicted to be near the heme. Three classes of variants were investigated; (a) those with changes at position Phe-74, which forms part of the interior heme pocket on the proximal side (His-77, Fig. 1) and is conserved (Phe or Tyr) in CooA homologues (21Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1320-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), (b) those with changes at position Leu-120, an invariant residue in CooA homologues (21Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1320-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which forms part of the heme pocket on the distal side and simultaneously serves as an “a” position coiled-coil residue in the C-helix, and (c) those in which changes to the C-helix position 121-126 segment (Fig. 1) have significantly stabilized the DNA-binding conformation of the protein. 5R. L. Kerby, N. D. Lanz, H. Youn, and G. P. Roberts, submitted for publication. These variants were produced by the mutagenesis scheme described below and selected on the basis of in vivo screens in which CooA activity is linked to the expression of β-galactosidase. 5R. L. Kerby, N. D. Lanz, H. Youn, and G. P. Roberts, submitted for publication. The in vivo activity depends upon the variant accumulation levels, specific DNA binding affinity, and ability to interact with RNA polymerase. Consequently the biochemical properties of the identified variants were examined further through in vitro DNA binding. Randomization of the codon for residue 74 followed by screening for variants with CO-dependent activity in vivo yielded two distinct classes with activity above background (data not shown). Highly active variants possessed either Phe or Tyr residues, whereas variants with lower activity contained Leu, Gly, or His residues. At position 120, similar mutagenesis and screening showed that only Leu afforded CO-dependent activity similar to WT CooA; L120F and L120S, which were chosen for further study, were poorly activated by CO. The selection and analysis of the CO-independent, constitutively active variants possessing changes in the C-helix 121-126 region is elaborated elsewhere. 5R. L. Kerby, N. D. Lanz, H. Youn, and G. P. Roberts, submitted for publication. These changes produce CooA that is active even without added CO. In vitro DNA binding affinity (Table 1) was measured with a fluorescence polarization assay, which monitors binding of CooA to a Texas Red-labeled target DNA (20Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 121-126 C-helix variants precipitate from solution at high protein concentrations but were stabilized at higher salt concentrations. This property and their exceptional DNA affinity made analysis under standard conditions difficult (50 mm KCl had been used previously (12Youn H. Kerby R.L. Clark R.W. Burstyn J.N. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33616-33623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)); the DNA binding analysis was modified to include higher salt levels (250 mm KCl and 20 mm CaCl2) and a 1000-fold excess of nonspecific DNA to all samples. The affinity of CO-bound WT CooA for the target DNA was decreased ∼10-fold under these conditions relative to assays performed previously at lower salt levels (20Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In terms of DNA binding, F74Y and F74L CooAs showed CO-dependent affinities similar to that of WT CooA (Table 1), suggesting that the poor in vivo activity of F74L CooA represents a defect in its interaction with RNA polymerase. In contrast, changing Leu-120 to Phe or Ser diminished activity in vivo and in vitro, with a >10-fold decrease in DNA affinity relative to CO-bound WT CooA (Table 1). The activities of the 121-126 C-helix variants were unusual in two respects; (a) these variants possessed DNA binding affinities in vitro in the absence of CO that were similar to those of CO-bound WT CooA and (b) in the presence of CO their DNA binding affinity exceeded that of WT CooA. Two rather similar variants in this region were studied, with the following two sequences at positions 121-126: AYLLRL and RYL-LRL. In the following text, we will refer to them by these names or by (A/R)YLLRL for the pair.TABLE 1In vitro DNA binding affinities of purified CooA proteinsCooAFe(II) KdFe(II)-CO Kdnm in hemenm in hemeWTaAverage of independent assays with 95% confidence interval, shown in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab RR Frequencies Indicate Variable Fe-His Bond Strengths in CO Adducts of the CooA Variants—Resonance Raman spectra of heme-CO adducts reveal the positions of Fe-C and C-O stretching vibrations, and these positions provide information on both distal and proximal interactions of the adduct with the surrounding protein (22Spiro T.G. Wasbotten I.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 reveals an unusual pattern for the νFeC and νCO Raman bands of the CooA variants in this study. νCO varies over a significant range, 1975-1986 cm-1, but νFeC is essentially constant, at 486-487 cm-1. When there are changes in back-bonding due electrostatic influences in the vicinity of the bound CO, then νCO and νFeC are anticorrelated; as one increases, the other decreases as a result of changes in back-bonding (22Spiro T.G. Wasbotten I.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 3 (solid line) for a series of myoglobin (Mb) variants having substitutions among residues distal to the bound CO. However, increasing or decreasing the donor strength of the proximal ligand, trans to the CO, produces negative or positive deviations from the back-bonding correlation (22Spiro T.G. Wasbotten I.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The νCO/νFeC point for WT CooA falls significantly above the Mb line, implying, as noted earlier (10Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H. Nielsen S.B. Williams R.D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35384-35393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a significant weakening of the bond to the proximal imidazole ring relative to Mb. This was attributed to displacement of the heme as part of the activation mechanism of CooA induced by CO binding. We now observe that the data for the variants in the present study fall on a horizontal line that intersects the Mb line at about the position occupied by Mb variants in which the distal histidine is replaced by apolar residues. This is exactly the behavior expected if the CO pocket is apolar in CooA (as inferred earlier), but the Fe-His bond is weakened to different extents depending on the variant. The higher νCO reflects diminished back-donation because of diminished forward donation by the His ligand; however, the expected inverse effect on νFeC is compensated by diminished σ competition between the Fe-His and Fe-C bonds (22Spiro T.G. Wasbotten I.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations by Franzen (23Franzen S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 12578-12589Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) find νCO lowering but little change in νFeC when the bond to a proximal imidazole is strengthened by donating a H-bond, as does the proximal ligand in Mb (see the lower inset in Fig. 3). We infer that the CooA Fe-His is weakened to various extents, reflecting variable displacement of the heme group. Significantly, νCO is increased when CO-bound WT CooA binds its target DNA sequence, implying a further weakening of the Fe-His bond (Fig. 2). This same higher frequency is seen for CO adducts of the constitutively active (A/R)YLLRL variants, in the absence of DNA, and no further shift is seen when DNA is bound. In the presence of CO, DNA binding affinity is about three times higher for (A/R)YLLRL than for WT CooA (Table 1). We interpret these results to mean that the position 121-126 substitutions have fully stabilized the on conformation of CooA-CO, whereas CO-bound WT CooA is in an equilibrium between on and off forms or else it is in an intermediate form, which is turned on by DNA binding. Although an equilibrium between two forms should produce a superposition of two spectral responses, the spectral resolution is insufficient to distinguish a superposition from an intermediate response; the difference in the central position of the νCO band is less than its width (Fig. 2). An equilibrium mixture of on and off populations would be consistent with kinetic evidence for “open” and “closed” forms of CooA coexisting in the CO-bound WT protein (17Puranik M. Nielsen S.B. Youn H. Hvitved A.N. Bourassa J.L. Case M.A. Tengroth C. Balakrishnan G. Thorsteinsson M.V. Groves J.T. McLendon G.L. Roberts G.P. Olson J.S. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21096-21108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand the L120S and L120F variants, which display low CO-dependent activity, have significantly stronger Fe-His bonds, as judged by their νCO/νFeC points being closer to the Mb line than is the WT protein. Thus, the low activity of these mutants can be attributed to destabilization of the on conformation, with an attendant diminution in the average heme displacement. The L120S variant displays a small but noticeable (3 cm-1) downshift in νFeC relative to the L120F variant and a corresponding upshift (4 cm-1) in νCO. These opposite shifts are a signal of decreased back-donation, associated with negative polarity among distal groups near the bound CO. This effect implies that the Leu-120 side chain is close to the CO and that replacement with Ser introduces negative polarity via the OH lone pair, similar to the H64V/V68T variant of Mb. Yamashita et al. (15Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47320-47325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reached a similar conclusion by examining the L120N variant, although in that case there was a 6-cm-1 upshift in νFeC, presumably reflecting positive polarity from the asparagine NH2 group (15Yamashita T.

Also, the CooA preparation studied by Aono and co-workers (19Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol.

The preparation of Aono and co-workers did contain a fraction with νCO = 1979 cm-1, the position found in picosecond Fourier transform IR experiments for CO-bound CooA molecules undergoing photolysis (25Rubtsov I.V.

Dermal administration of DEA diminishes hepatic stores of the essential nutrient choline, and we previously reported that dietary choline deficiency during pregnancy reduces neurogenesis and increases apoptosis in the hippocampus of fetal rats and mice. Therefore, DEA could also alter brain development. Timed-pregnant C57BL/6 mice were dosed dermally from gestation day 7 through 17 with DEA at 0, 20, 80, 160, 320, and 640 mg/kg body/day. At doses of DEA > 80 mg/kg body/day, we observed decreased litter size. In fetuses (embryonic day 17) collected from dams treated dermally with 80 mg/kg body/day DEA, we observed decreased neural progenitor cell mitosis at the ventricular surface of the ventricular zone of the hippocampus [to 56+/-14% (se) histone 3 (H3) phosphorylation as compared to controls; P < 0.01]. We also observed increased apoptosis in fetal hippocampus (to 170+/-10% of control measured using TUNEL and to 178+/-7% of control measured using activated caspase 3; P < 0.01). Thus, maternal exposure to DEA reduces the number of neural progenitor cells in hippocampus by two mechanisms, and this could permanently alter memory function in offspring of mothers exposed to this common ingredient of shampoos and soaps."

The anti-platelet drugs aspirin and clopidogrel have proven efficacy in secondary prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular reocclusion (1Meijer A. Verheugt F.W.

Clopidogrel, a P2Y12 antagonist, blocks the ability of ADP to inhibit stimulated adenylate cyclase. However, despite prophylaxis with these anti-platelet drugs, reocclusion of coronary arteries occurs in 20-30% of patients after thrombolytic therapy or angioplasty probably because of the inability of these drugs to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet activation (3Gum P.A.

At low concentrations of thrombin, platelet aggregation depends in part on ADP and thromboxane A2, which are released by platelets and exert autocrine-mediated enhancement. At high concentrations of thrombin, platelets are aggregated and activated by pathways independent of both ADP and thromboxane A2. In contrast, elevation of intracellular cAMP produces potent inhibition of all pathways of platelet activation including increase in intracellular Ca2+, shape change, aggregation, secretion, and the effects of phospholipases A2 and C, as well as their responses of platelets to thrombin.Cyclic nucleotide PDE3A 4The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; Sp-cAMPS-BDB, Sp-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic-S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl) monophosphorothioate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; 8-BDB-TcAMP, 8-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate. 4The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; Sp-cAMPS-BDB, Sp-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic-S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl) monophosphorothioate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; 8-BDB-TcAMP, 8-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate. is the most abundant cAMP PDE in platelets.

Residues His741, His821, Asp822, and Asp937 (His756, His836, Asp837, and Asp950 in PDE3A) and one water molecule in PDE3B are involved in the first metal Mg2+ binding. The second Mg2+ forms hydrogen bonds with Asp822 and five water molecules (13Scapin G. Patel S.B. Chung C. Varnerin J.P. Edmondson S.D. Mastracchio A. Parmee E.R. Singh S.B. Becker J.W. Van der Ploeg L.H. Tota M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6091-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Water molecules coordinated to the metal ions may act as the nucleophile in the hydrolysis reaction to mediate catalysis.The presence of a 44-amino acid insert within the catalytic domain is a unique feature of the PDE3 gene family. In the PDE3B crystal structure, the 44-amino acid insertion (Pro758-Cys801; Fig. 1) is located between helices 6 and 7 (13Scapin G. Patel S.B. Chung C. Varnerin J.P. Edmondson S.D. Mastracchio A. Parmee E.R. Singh S.B. Becker J.W. Van der Ploeg L.H. Tota M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6091-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This insertion lacks any clear secondary structure organization, and residues 767-781 are not visible in the electron density maps. This insert in human PDE3A is comprised of amino acid residues 773-816 (Fig. 1). Within the insert there is 38.6% identity between PDE3A and PDE3B including conserved triplets at the N terminus, C terminus, and the middle of the insert. Tang et al. (14Tang K.M. Jang E.K. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showed that removal of this insert from PDE3A resulted in the complete loss of activity. Double mutants, P773A/G774A and Y814A/G815A, from each of the N and C termini of the PDE3A insert, which are β turns, display markedly reduced activity (14Tang K.M. Jang E.K. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, knowledge of the role of the 44-amino acid insert of PDE3A in the regulation of enzyme activity or interactions with substrate and/or inhibitor is incomplete.Previously, we have synthesized a nonhydrolyzable, reactive substrate analog, Sp-cAMPS-BDB, which irreversibly inactivates PDE3A in a time-dependent fashion with KI = 10.1 ± 1.7 μm and kmax = 0.0116 ± 0.0004 min-1 (15Hung S.H. Madhusoodanan K.S. Beres J.A. Boyd R.L. Baldwin J.L. Zhang W. Colman R.W. Colman R.F. Bioorg. Chem. 2002; 30: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Sp-cAMPS-BDB targets both the cAMP- and cGMP-binding sites but favors the cAMP site. The protection studies indicate effectiveness of protectants in decreasing rate of inactivation by Sp-cAMPS-BDB is: Sp-cAMPS (Kd = 24 μm) > Rp-cGMPS (1360), Sp-cGMPS (1460) > GMP (4250), AMP (10600), Rp-cAMPS (22170 μm). Sp-cAMPS-BDB has proven to be an effective active site-directed affinity label for PDE3A.In this paper, we describe specific incorporation of PDE3A by a reactive substrate analog, Sp-cAMPS-BDB, isolation of a peptide in the unique insert of PDE3A, and construction of mutant enzymes that identify the amino acid targeted by Sp-cAMPS-BDB. In addition, the role of the insert was further explored by kinetic analyses of nine additional insert mutants. The results define a new functional mechanism by which binding of cAMP to the flexible loop of platelet PDE3A may induce a local conformational change that allows interaction with catalytic residues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate ammonium salt [2,8-3H]cAMP) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The nonhydrolyzable, reactive cAMP analog, Sp-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic-S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)monophosphoro-thioate (Sp-cAMPS-BDB) was synthesized as previously described (15Hung S.H. Madhusoodanan K.S. Beres J.A. Boyd R.L. Baldwin J.L. Zhang W. Colman R.W. Colman R.F. Bioorg. Chem. 2002; 30: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cell lines, Sf-900 II SFM medium, BaculoDirect transfection and expression system, the ProBound resin, and Anti-HisG antibody were purchased from Invitrogen. Protease inhibitor mixture set III (PIC III) was purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). A Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit was purchased from Pierce. Gentamicin sulfate, cAMP, and N-ethylmaleimide were purchased from Sigma. HPLC grade acetonitrile was obtained from Fisher.Measurement of the Incorporation of Sp-cAMPS-BDB into PDE3A—PDE3A was incubated with 100 μm Sp-cAMPS-BDB ina50mm Hepes buffer at pH 7.3 containing 20 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 m NaCl. At various times of incubation (0, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 min, respectively), the aliquots were removed, and the residual enzyme activity of PDE3A was determined to correlate with the incorporation (see “Enzyme Activity Assay”). At each time interval, 100 mm [3H]NaBH4 (dissolved in 20 mm NaOH) was added consecutively to reach a final concentration of 2 mm at 4 °C for a total of 1.5 h. [3H]NaBH4 reduces the two oxygens of the diketo group from Sp-cAMPS-BDB to two [3H] hydroxyl groups. The excess [3H]NaBH4 and the free Sp-cAMPS-BDB were removed by four consecutive centrifugations using Microcon centrifugal devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquots were removed from the retentate to measure the protein concentration using the Coomassie Plus protein assay. The amount of Sp-cAMPS-BDB incorporated into PDE3A from reduction of the affinity labeled enzyme by [3H]NaBH4 was calculated by measuring the radioactive (3H) content by using a Beckman Coulter liquid scintillation analyzer (model LS6500; Fullerton, CA). Control samples were tested using a similar procedure with the pretreatment of cold NaBH4 with Sp-cAMPS-BDB prior to the addition of enzyme.Trypsin Digestion of the Sp-cAMPS-BDB-modified Enzyme—PDE3A (0.8 mg) was incubated with 100 μm Sp-cAMPS-BDB at 25°C for 3 h(∼10% residual activity remained). The incubated mixture was treated twice with 100 mm [3H]NaBH4 for a total of 1.5 h (final concentration, 2 mm), followed by a carboxylation of free SH groups with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min. After removal of the excess reagents by centrifugation using Microcon centrifugal devices, the modified enzyme was digested at 37 °C by 2 consecutive additions of 5% (w/w) tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine pancreatic trypsin for a total of 2 h.Purification and Determination of the Sequence of Modified Peptide—The radioactive tryptic digest was lyophilized, redissolved in 250 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied to an HPLC system using a reverse phase Vydac (Hesperia, CA) C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm). Separation was conducted at the elution rate of 1 ml/min using solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) for the first 10 min, followed by a linear gradient from solvent A to 45% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) for 220 min, a linear gradient from 45% solvent B to 100% Solvent B for 20 min, and solvent B for 10 min, successively. The eluent was monitored at 220 nm. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, from which 400 μl was counted for radioactivity. The amino acid sequence of isolated radioactive peptides was determined using an automated gas phase peptide sequence analyzer from Applied Biosystems (model 470A; Foster City, CA) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (model 120) and computer (model 900A). The sequencing results were used to identify the location of the modified peptide in the active site of the catalytic region of PDE3A. This process was repeated twice with identical results.Construction and Purification of PDE3A Mutants—A deletion mutant of PDE3A cDNA coding for the amino acid residues 665-1141 (16Cheung P.P. Xu H. McLaughlin M.M. Ghazaleh F.A. Livi G.P. Colman R.W. Blood. 1996; 88: 1321-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into a pENTER-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to produce two sites for linear recombination. PDE3A insert mutants H782A, H796A, H798A, S804A, K805A, Y807A, Y807C, T810A, D811A, D812A, Y814A, G815A, and C816S were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the mutants were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis (Sidney Kimmel Nucleic Acid Facility, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Recombinant mutant baculoviruses were produced by linear combination using BaculoDirect Transfection kit (Invitrogen). Expression of the catalytic region (residues 665-1141) of PDE3A wild type and mutant enzymes using a baculovirus/insect cell Sf9 system and protein purification using a ProBond Nickel resin column has been previously described (17Zhang W. Colman R.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 3380-3386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang W. Ke H. Tretiakova A.P. Jameson B. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Protein Concentration Determination—Protein concentration of the purified enzymes and purified anti-insert antibody were determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent using bovine serum albumin as standard. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a Bio-Tek automatic microplate reader equipped with KC4 module for data analysis (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT).Western Blot Analysis—The PDE3A wild type and mutants were separated on 10% Bis-Tris gel electrophoresis purchased from Invitrogen. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the Xcell II module at a constant voltage of 30 volts for 1 h at room temperature for Western blotting. The membranes were processed using the Chromogenic WesternBreeze system and probed with anti-insert PDE3A antibody (see effects of anti-insert antibody) to detect the presence of PDE3A.Enzyme Activity Assay—PDE3A activity was measured by the amount of cAMP hydrolyzed as previously described (19Grant P.G. Colman R.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1801-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Enzyme was added to a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.8 μm [3H]cAMP. Reaction mixtures both with and without enzymes were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Catalysis was terminated by serial addition of 0.2 m of ZnSO4 and 0.2 m Ba(OH)2, which precipitates AMP but not cAMP. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The BaSO4 pellets containing the [3H]5′-AMP precipitant were discarded. Aliquots of supernatants containing unreacted [3H]cAMP were removed and counted in a Beckman Coulter liquid scintillation analyzer. Enzyme activity was measured by comparing the amount of cAMP hydrolyzed in PDE3A containing samples to no enzyme controls. These data were then used to calculate enzyme specific activity in nmol of cAMP hydrolyzed per mg of protein per min.Kinetic Constants Determination—The rates (nmol/s) of cAMP hydrolysis for the PDE3A wild type and mutant enzymes were determined using various concentrations of substrate cAMP from 0.02 to 14 μm. The values of Km and Vmax for each of the enzymes were determined by Michaelis-Menten equation as calculated by Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.1 software (Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA). The kcat (s-1) was obtained by dividing Vmax (nmol/s) by the molar enzyme concentration (nmol).Reaction of Sp-cAMPS-BDB with Mutant Enzymes—Purified PDE3A mutant enzyme (Y807A, Y807C, D811A, or D812A) was incubated at 25 °C with various concentrations of Sp-cAMPS-BDB in a 50 mm Hepes buffer at pH 7.3 containing 20 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 m NaCl. At timed intervals (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 45, and 60 min), aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn, diluted in a buffer containing 47.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.04, 20 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MES, and assayed in triplicate for residual PDE3A activity. Control samples were performed under identical conditions without the presence of affinity label Sp-cAMPS-BDB.Effect of Anti-insert Antibody on Enzyme Activity—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the synthetic peptide 802VFSKTYNVTDDKYGC816, the C-terminal 15 amino acids of the PDE3A insert (Fig. 1), which also contain the octapeptide, was prepared by Sigma Genosys and designated as an anti-insert antibody. PDE3A, and mutants Y807A and Y807C were incubated respectively with various concentrations of the anti-insert antibody to a enzyme to antibody ratio of 1.3, 2.0, or 4.0 for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, enzyme activity was determined according to the “Enzyme Activity Assay” procedure. The activity of PDE3A wild type, Y807A, and Y807C without antibody was set as 100% activity. The preimmune IgG was used as a control to compare the activity of wild type, Y807A, and Y807C. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate.Molecular Modeling—A homology model of PDE3A based on the crystal structure of PDE4B2B has been published (8Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, the model did not contain the additional 44-amino acid insert found in PDE3A. We have now refined the PDE3A model using the recently published PDE3B structures (13Scapin G. Patel S.B. Chung C. Varnerin J.P. Edmondson S.D. Mastracchio A. Parmee E.R. Singh S.B. Becker J.W. Van der Ploeg L.H. Tota M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6091-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that contain the 44-amino acid insert unique to PDE3. Sybyl 6.91 FlexX docking module (Tripos) was then used to dock the affinity label Sp-cAMPS-BDB to PDE3A. Because mutant Y807A affected the Km, Tyr807 was included in the defined cAMP-binding pocket to construct the model. Residues involved in cAMP binding (17Zhang W. Colman R.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 3380-3386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang W. Ke H. Tretiakova A.P. Jameson B. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were used as a defined cAMP binding pocket (Tyr807, Asn845, Glu866, Glu971, Phe972, and Phe1004). This docking model was utilized to illustrate and further evaluate the kinetic results obtained from the mutants of insert amino acids of PDE3A.RESULTSIncorporation of Sp-cAMPS-BDB into PDE3A Is Time-dependent—To quantify the amount of the affinity label Sp-cAMPS-BDB incorporated into PDE3A, the enzyme (0.38 mg/ml) was incubated with 100 μm Sp-cAMPS-BDB at pH 7.3, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 (left panel) shows that the incorporation of PDE3A by Sp-cAMPS-BDB is linear as a function of time. The addition of [3H]NaBH4 to an incubation mixture of enzyme and Sp-cAMPS-BDB stops the reaction by reducing the diketo group of Sp-cAMPS-BDB to a[3H]diol group. Fig. 2 (right panel) shows that the residual enzymatic activity is inversely proportional to the incorporation. At 80 min, 0.86 mol of Sp-cAMPS-BDB was incorporated for each mol of enzyme which corresponded 19% of residual enzymatic activity or 81% inactivation. Thus, 1.08 mol of Sp-cAMPS-BDB was required to inactivate each mole of enzyme indicating a stoichiometry close to 1.0 of the affinity label and the enzyme.FIGURE 2Incorporation of Sp-cAMPS-BDB into PDE3A. The left panel shows the time-dependent incorporation of Sp-cAMPS-BDB into PDE3A. The enzyme was incubated in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, at 25 °C. At the indicated times, the incorporation was stopped by two additions of [3H]NaBH4 (2 mm). The excess reagent was removed by four consecutive centrifugations using Microcon centrifugal devices. The aliquots were removed from the retentate to measure the protein concentration and radioactivity. The right panel shows the relationship between inactivation and incorporation of Sp-cAMPS-BDB into PDE3A. The residual activity of the unmodified enzyme was determined at 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 min. Enzymes treated with the same procedure but without Sp-cAMPS-BDB in the incubation mixture were used as controls for activity. The data were fitted to linear regression equation and plotted. The results are the means of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Isolated Sp-cAMPS-BDB-modified Peptide in PDE3A Is Located in the Unique 44-Amino Acid Insert—PDE3A (11 nmol) was incubated with 100 μm Sp-cAMPS-BDB for 3 h and treated with [3H]NaBH4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The modified enzyme was digested by trypsin for 2 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 (solid line) shows that on the reverse phase HPLC separation of the tryptic digest, most of the peptides elute between 0 and 160 min (0 and 30% solvent B). Two major radioactive peaks were observed as shown in Fig. 3 (dashed line, labeled I and II).FIGURE 3Isolation of trypsin-digested peptides by HPLC. The affinity labeled PDE3A was digested with trypsin. The trypsin-digested peptides were separated by a reverse phase HPLC C18 column under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The curve with the solid line shows the A220 nm HPLC profile. The gradient of acetonitrile of the tryptic digested peptides is shown with the solid line. The curve with the dotted line shows the radioactivity pattern of the same chromatograph. The two radioactive peaks are labeled I and II. This experiment was performed twice with the results in close agreement. This figure represents one of the two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The amino acid sequence of the purified peptides (Fig. 3, peaks I and II) was determined by Edman degradation using an automated gas phase sequencer. Peak I contains small peptides (data not shown). The amino acid sequence of the peptide from peak II exhibits a single octapeptide, assigned as 806TYNVTDDK813 within the unique 44-amino acid insert of PDE3A (Fig. 1). This peptide results from enzyme cleavage after Lys805 and Lys813, consistent with the specificity of the trypsin recognition sites. The yield of each phenylthiohydantoin-derivative was recorded and ranged from 40 to 20 pmol (data not shown). As expected, the yield decreases as the cycle number increases. Peptide 806-813 is located C-terminal of the first metal-binding motif, 752HNRIH756.Residue Tyr807 in PDE3A Is the Amino Acid Modified by the Affinity Label Sp-cAMPS-BDB—Sp-cAMPS-BDB reacts with nucleophilic amino acids. Thus, Tyr807, Asp811, and Asp812 from peptides 806-813 (determined from the tryptic cleavage study) are candidates for interacting with the affinity label. Lys813 was not considered because this is the trypsin cleavage site, and cleavage would not have occurred if that lysine were modified. To identify which amino acid is being modified by Sp-cAMPS-BDB, mutant enzymes Y807A, D811A, and D812A were constructed, expressed, and purified.To evaluate the effect of mutations on the reaction with Sp-cAMPS-BDB, the mutant enzymes were incubated with the affinity label, and their activity was tested as a function of time. Fig. 4 (A-D) shows the results of reaction of wild type and mutant enzymes, Y807A, D811A, and D812A, respectively, with Sp-cAMPS-BDB. Sp-cAMPS-BDB irreversibly inactivates both mutants D811A and D812A exhibiting saturation kinetics (Fig. 4, H-I). The kmax values for D811A and D812A are 0.005 ± 0.0002 and 0.003 ± 0.0001 min-1, and the KI values are 29.9 ± 2.9 and 24.9 ± 2.5 μm, respectively. The KI values of both D811A and D812A is 2.5-3-fold larger than that of wild type (KI = 10.1 ± 1.7 μm; Fig. 4F). The kmax values of D811A and D812A are one-half and one-third, respectively, that of wild type (kmax = 0.0116 ± 0.0004 min-1; Fig. 4F). These relatively minor changes in kinetics indicate that residues Asp811 and Asp812 are not the modified amino acid of the wild type enzyme that reacts with Sp-cAMPS-BDB. In contrast, Y807A is not inactivated by Sp-cAMPS-"

Repeat instability has been extensively studied in bacterial plasmids, where repeats undergo deletion at high rates. We report an assay for (CAG)n·(CTG)n deletion from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene integrated into the Escherichia coli chromosome. In strain AB1157, deletion rates for 25–60 (CAG)·(CTG) repeats integrated in the chromosome ranged from 6.88 × 10–9 to 1.33 × 10–10, or ∼6,300 to 660,000-fold lower than in plasmid pBR325. In contrast to the situation in plasmids, deletions occur at a higher rate when (CTG)43, rather than (CAG)43, comprised the leading template strand, and complete rather than partial deletions were the predominant mutation observed. Repeats were also stable on long term growth following multiple passages through exponential and stationary phase. Mutations in priA and recG increased or decreased deletion rates, but repeats were still greatly stabilized in the chromosome. The remarkable stability of (CAG)n·(CTG)n repeats in the E. coli chromosome may result from the differences in the mechanisms for replication or the probability for recombination afforded by a high plasmid copy number. The integration of (CAG)n·(CTG)n repeats into the chromosome provides a model system in which the inherent stability of these repeats reflects that in the human genome more closely.

In certain diseases, such as DM1, repeats can expand from less than 30 to 30–80 copies, resulting in mild symptoms, and then expand to thousands of copies in severely affected individuals. In the majority of (CAG)·(CTG)-associated diseases, however, full expansion mutations causing the disease are less than 80 repeats in length (see Ref. 2Cleary J.D. Pearson C.E. Cytogenet.

Plasmid-based assays have revealed that mutations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (mutS), excision repair (uvrA), recombination (recA and recB), and replication restart (priA, recG, ruvAB, recF, and recO) influence repeat instability in E. coli (8Hashem V.I.

Genet. 1997; 17: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and repeat deletions may predominantly result from attempts to restart DNA replication when the replication fork is stalled at trinucleotide repeats (8Hashem V.I.

Repeat instability in plasmids may also result from the high plasmid copy number that may promote recombination between repeats (18Napierala M. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Vogel W. Steinbach P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In other diseases such as DM1 and Huntington disease, long repeat tracts can increase in length throughout life (21Martorell L. Gamez J. Cayuela M.L. Gould F.K. McAbney J.P. Ashizawa T. Monckton D.G.

Thus, the study of triplet repeats in bacterial plasmids, although useful for studying the mechanism and genetics of deletion, does not model many characteristics of (CAG)n·(CTG)n instability in human cells where high rates of deletion are not observed.Here, we have developed a chromosome-based genetic assay for repeat deletion. For this, we placed a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene, disrupted by insertion of (CAG)n·(CTG)n repeats, into the phage λ attB attachment site in the E. coli chromosome using the λ InCh method (24Boyd D. Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In both wild type cells and strains containing mutations affecting replication restart, (CAG)n·(CTG)n tracts were remarkably stable in the E. coli chromosome when compared with the very high rate of instability in plasmids. Thus, this model system more closely mimics the situation for repeats in the human chromosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Media—Parental E. coli strains, AB1157, MG1655, and SM551, were used as permissive strains for the generation of λ InCh1 lysates, which were prepared from parental lysogenic strain DH6521 (Table 1). Derivatives of bacterial strain AB1157, AG109 (priA2::kan), RJ1075 (priA4; where the final six amino acids of the PriA protein are replaced by 12 different amino acid residues, resulting in a partially functional PriA (25Gregg A.V.

Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)), and N3793 (ΔrecG263) were used as target strains for developing the chromosome-based genetic selection assays. Strains containing the original pBR325 plasmids were grown in λ broth (10 g of bacto-tryptone and 5 g of NaCl/liter H2O). For reversion and long term growth experiments, cells were grown at 37 °C in K medium (M9 buffer supplemented with 1% casamino acids, 1% glucose, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.001% thiamine) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amp). M9 buffer contained 1 g of NH4Cl, 5.8 g of Na2HPO4, and 3 g of KH2PO4/liter. K medium + Amp plates contained 100 μg/ml Amp. K medium + Amp + Cm plates contained 100 mg/ml Amp and 25 mg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm).TABLE 1Escherichia coli strainsStrainRelevant genetic marker(s) or featuresReference and sourceParental strainsAB1157thr- araC14 leuB6 Δ(gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-33 qsr'-glnV44(AS) galK2(Oc) λ- Rac-0 hisG4(Oc) rfbD1 mgl-51 rpoS396 (Am) rpsL31(strR) kdgK5 xyl-5 mtl-1 argE3(Oc) thiMG1655LAM- rph-1SM551F- λ- λs Δlac(MS265) mel NalAr supF58(= sulII+)24Boyd D.

Open table in a new tab Construction of the Chromosome-based Genetic Assay—The cat gene, disrupted by (CAG)n·(CTG)n tracts from pVH plasmids derived from pBR325 (10Hashem V.I. Rosche W.A. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 502: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was inserted into the E. coli chromosome using λ InCh vectors as described by Boyd et al. (24Boyd D. Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Different plasmids were used that contained either orientation of the cat gene, thus reversing the repeats with respect to the direction of replication. The structure at the insertion site was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing as recommended (24Boyd D. Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Repeat Deletion Rate Measurements and Analysis of Revertants—Measurement of the rate of reversion to chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr), which occurs by deletion to ≤24 repeats, was as described (10Hashem V.I. Rosche W.A. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 502: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.-H. Pytlos M.J. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2006; 595: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At least six independent reversion assays were performed for each strain. The mutation rate was determined by the method of the median frequency (26Drake J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) for the individual mutation rates were calculated by the method of the population mean (27Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. 4th. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1999Google Scholar). Statistical significance levels (p values) between the mutation rates were determined by the two-sample ranking test of the Mann-Whitney test (27Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. 4th. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1999Google Scholar). The nature of the deletion events in the Cmr revertants was analyzed by PCR as described (10Hashem V.I. Rosche W.A. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 502: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Long Term Growth Assay and Analysis—A 10-ml culture in K medium containing ampicillin (30 μg/ml) was inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight at 37 °C at 250 rpm. The next day, the cultures were recultivated by a 1:1,000 dilution into 10 ml of K medium containing ampicillin and grown for another 1 or 2 days. This procedure was repeated every day for a total of 7 days and, in a separate experiment, every 2 days for a total of 14 days. Plasmids were purified each time the culture was recultivated. The length of the repeat tract was determined by polyacrylamide gel analysis of PCR products encompassing the repeat region, and the frequency of Cmr revertants in the population was determined.RESULTSA Genetic Assay for Studying the Genomic Instability of DNA Repeats Inserted into the E. coli Chromosome—We have developed and used pBR325 plasmid-based genetic assays to measure rates of deletion of (CAG)n·(CTG)n tracts in E. coli (8Hashem V.I. Rosche W.A. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2004; 554: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Hashem V.I. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 508: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Hashem V.I. Rosche W.A. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 502: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.-H. Pytlos M.J. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2006; 595: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we have introduced this system, in single copy, into the E. coli chromosome. For this, both orientations of the cat gene in plasmid pBR325, disrupted by (CAG)n·(CTG)n tracts, were inserted into the λ attB site of the E. coli chromosome (24Boyd D. Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The two orientations, with respect to the chromosomal replication origin (oriC), place the (CAG)n or (CTG)n tract in the leading template strand for E. coli chromosome replication (Fig. 1). During the process of introducing the repeats into the chromosome, the (CAG)79·(CTG)79 tract present in the original plasmid was shortened to (CTG)60·(CAG)60 in the cured lysogens SKA793, SKG793, SKR793, and SKN793 and to (CAG)52·(CTG)52 in the cured lysogens SKA794, SKG794, and SKN794. However, cured lysogen SKR794 contained the original length (CAG)79·(CTG)79 (Table 1). The (CAG)25·(CTG)25 tract was duplicated to (CAG)50·(CTG)50 in cured lysogens, SKA254, SKG254, SKR254, and SKN254 (Table 1). Presumably, these changes occurred during construction of the primary lysogens. The initial (CAG)43·(CTG)43 tracts were stable upon introduction into the chromosome in all cured lysogens (Table 1).As expected in this genetic assay, the in-frame insertion of (CAG)n·(CTG)n tracts of 25 repeats or longer in the cat gene resulted in a chloramphenicol-sensitive (Cms) phenotype in either orientation of the cat gene. In plasmids, deletions that reduce the length to less than 25 (CAG)·(CTG) repeats restore a chloramphenicol-resistant (Cmr) phenotype, allowing measurement of the rates of deletions (10Hashem V.I. Rosche W.A. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 502: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This was also the case for the cat gene constructs integrated into the chromosome as revertants containing 23 repeats were obtained for Cmr revertants from cells containing the (CAG)25·(CTG)25 tract (see below).(CAG)·(CTG) Repeats Were Very Stable in the E. coli Chromosome—To determine (CAG)·(CTG) deletion rates, cultures were grown to mid-log phase in K medium from single colonies from frozen cultures, as described (10Hashem V.I. Rosche W.A. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 502: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In parental strain AB1157, mutation rates for (CAG)25, (CAG)43, and (CAG)52 tracts in the leading template strand of the E. coli chromosome ranged from 2.05 to 18.02 × 10–10 Cmr revertants per cell per generation (Table 2). Mutation rates for (CTG)43 and (CTG)60 tracts in the leading template strand of the E. coli chromosome were 6.88 × 10–9 and 2.29 × 10–9, respectively.TABLE 2Deletion rates of (CAG)n·(CTG)n tracts on the E. coli chromosomeRepeatsAB1157 (parental)AG109 (priA2)RF1075 (priA4)N3793 (recG263)Cmr reversion rate × 10-10Rel. rateaRelative rates ((mutation rate in mutant strain)/(mutation rate in parent strain)) were determined by comparison to the parental strain.Cmr reversion rate × 10-10Rel. rateaRelative rates ((mutation rate in mutant strain)/(mutation rate in parent strain)) were determined by comparison to the parental strain.Cmr reversion rate × 10-10Rel. rateaRelative rates ((mutation rate in mutant strain)/(mutation rate in parent strain)) were determined by comparison to the parental strain.Cmr reversion rate × 10-10Rel. rateaRelative rates ((mutation rate in mutant strain)/(mutation rate in parent strain)) were determined by comparison to the parental strain.95% C.I.bMutation rates (Cmr revertants per cell per generation) were calculated by the method for the median (26) 95% C.I. for the individual rate calculations (27) are shown in parentheses.95% C.I.bMutation rates (Cmr revertants per cell per generation) were calculated by the method for the median (26) 95% C.I. for the individual rate calculations (27) are shown in parentheses.95% C.I.bMutation rates (Cmr revertants per cell per generation) were calculated by the method for the median (26) 95% C.I. for the individual rate calculations (27) are shown in parentheses.95% C.I.bMutation rates (Cmr revertants per cell per generation) were calculated by the method for the median (26) 95% C.I. for the individual rate calculations (27) are shown in parentheses.(CAG)251.32 (1.1-1.56)13.73 (2.36-5.11)2.810.368 (0.23-0.51)0.270.244 (0.1-0.39)0.18(CTG)4368.83 (64.93-72.73)15.01 (4.5-5.12)0.0712.79 (7.71-17.87)0.182.873 (2.59-3.16)0.04(CAG)4318.02 (15.35-20.69)14.26 (3.73-4.8)0.2311.3 (5.98-16.63)0.6211.44 (9.09-13.16)0.63(CTG)6022.9 (20.94-24.86)139.14 (13.17-65.11)1.79.89 (7.29-12.49)0.4345.27 (41.54-49)1.98(CAG)522.054 (1.77-2.34)18.39 (4.4-12.37)4.148.49 (41.98-55)23.6(CAG)7914.17 (10.19-18.16)NAa Relative rates ((mutation rate in mutant strain)/(mutation rate in parent strain)) were determined by comparison to the parental strain.b Mutation rates (Cmr revertants per cell per generation) were calculated by the method for the median (26Drake J.W.

Pytlos M.J. Sinden R.R. Mutat. Res. 2006; 595: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the priA2 strain (AG109), mutation rates for the two orientations of (CTG)43 and (CAG)43 tracts were very similar, and they were 14- and 4-fold lower than the rates in the isogenic parental strain AB1157, respectively (Table 2). The differences in rates comparing the parental and priA2 strain were significant (p < 0.001). In contrast, mutation rates for (CAG)25, (CTG)60, and (CAG)52 tracts in the E. coli chromosome were increased by factors of 2.8, 1.7, and 4.1, respectively (p < 0.01–0.005) when compared with rates in parental strain AB1157. In the priA4 strain (RF1075), mutation rates for most repeats ((CAG)25, (CAG)43, and (CTG)43 tracts in the chromosome) were decreased 1.6–5.5-fold when compared with the parental strain (p < 0.01–0.001). The mutation rate for the (CAG)79 tract was similar to rates for repeat lengths from 43 to 60 in this strain. In strain recG263, mutation rates for (CAG)25, (CTG)43, and (CAG)43 tracts were decreased 1.6–25-fold when compared with the parental strain (p < 0.001), whereas mutation rates for (CTG)60 and (CAG)52 were increased 2- and 23.6-fold, respectively, relative to the parental strain (p < 0.001).(CAG)n·(CTG)n Repeats Generally Undergo Complete Deletions in the E. coli Chromosome during Selection in Log Phase Growth—Mutation spectra of Cmr revertants were characterized by PCR analyses (Table 3). All of the initial 43–79 (CAG)·(CTG) repeats were completely deleted in the Cmr revertants in all strains. When (CAG)25 tracts were placed in the leading template strand of the E. coli chromosome, complete deletions prevailed in the parental, priA4, and recG263 strains, although several Cmr revertants in wild type and the recG strain had deletions of only two repeats, leaving 23 repeats in the chromosome. In the priA2 strain, only the deletion of two repeats was observed for (CAG)25.TABLE 3Deletion spectra for (CTG)n·(CAG)n tracts in the CAT gene in the E. coli chromosome in AB1157 derivativesRepeatsAB1157 (wild type)AG109 (priA2)RF1075 (priA4)N3793 (recG263)ΔCaΔC, complete deletion.ΔPbΔP, partial deletion.Repeats remainingΔCΔPRepeats remainingΔCΔPRepeats remainingΔCΔPRepeats remaining(CAG)251642302023200NAcNA, not applicable.19123(CTG)43200NA190NA200NA200NA(CAG)43200NA190NA190NA130NA(CTG)60200NA200NA200NA190NA(CAG)52190NA200NANDdND, not done.NDND200NA(CAG)79NDNDNDNDNDND190NANDNDNDa ΔC, complete deletion.b ΔP, partial deletion.c NA, not applicable.d ND, not done.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5042-5044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the stability of (CAG)·(CTG) repeats in the E. coli chromosome under these growth conditions, cells were grown for 7 days with recultivation every day or for 14 days with recultivation every 2 days. Cells were grown in the presence of ampicillin selection to maintain plasmid, but not chloramphenicol, selection to select for repeat deletions. On analysis of the repeat tracts in the total population by PCR analysis, only the original repeat lengths were detected (data not shown). Cmr revertants were detected in the long term growth cultures but at only very low levels, consistent with the rates reported in Table 2.DISCUSSIONWe have used a chromosome-based genetic assay to measure deletion rates of repeat tracts from the E. coli chromosome. For this, the cat gene, disrupted by the in-frame insertion of 25, 43, 52, 60, or 79 (CAG)·(CTG) repeats, was inserted into the phage λ attB attachment site of the E. coli chromosome using the λ InCh method (24Boyd D.
