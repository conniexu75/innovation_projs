https://openalex.org/W2113616846,"Neuroimaging studies of decision-making have generally related neural activity to objective measures (such as reward magnitude, probability or delay), despite choice preferences being subjective. However, economic theories posit that decision-makers behave as though different options have different subjective values. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that neural activity in several brain regions—particularly the ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex—tracks the revealed subjective value of delayed monetary rewards. This similarity provides unambiguous evidence that the subjective value of potential rewards is explicitly represented in the human brain."

https://openalex.org/W2104224322,"A wide-ranging overview of genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinomas, published in this issue, takes a new approach to genome analysis. The analysis of 371 tumours revealed 31 recurrent focal events, only six of which were known previously in lung carcinomas. A new candidate oncogene, TITF1, was found to be significant in a large number of lung cancers. This work shows that there are many more important cancer-related genes still undiscovered, and that systematic genomic study can reveal them. A large-scale study that analyses gene copy number changes in lung cancer identifies 31 recurrent focal events, which include amplification of the transcription factor NKX2.1 (also called TTF1), shown to act as an oncogene. Somatic alterations in cellular DNA underlie almost all human cancers1. The prospect of targeted therapies2 and the development of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches3,4,5,6,7,8 are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis of a large collection of tumours (n = 371) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome 14q13.3, is found in ∼12% of samples. On the basis of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 (NK2 homeobox 1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that many of the genes that are involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain to be discovered."

https://openalex.org/W2055514573,"To identify susceptibility alleles associated with rheumatoid arthritis, we genotyped 397 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis for 116,204 SNPs and carried out an association analysis in comparison to publicly available genotype data for 1,211 related individuals from the Framingham Heart Study. After evaluating and adjusting for technical and population biases, we identified a SNP at 6q23 (rs10499194, approximately 150 kb from TNFAIP3 and OLIG3) that was reproducibly associated with rheumatoid arthritis both in the genome-wide association (GWA) scan and in 5,541 additional case-control samples (P = 10(-3), GWA scan; P < 10(-6), replication; P = 10(-9), combined). In a concurrent study, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) has reported strong association of rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility to a different SNP located 3.8 kb from rs10499194 (rs6920220; P = 5 x 10(-6) in WTCCC). We show that these two SNP associations are statistically independent, are each reproducible in the comparison of our data and WTCCC data, and define risk and protective haplotypes for rheumatoid arthritis at 6q23."

https://openalex.org/W2063188304,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an extremely aggressive malignancy, which carries a dismal prognosis. Activating mutations of the Kras gene are common to the vast majority of human PDA. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that embryonic signaling pathway such as Hedgehog and Notch are inappropriately upregulated in this disease. The role of another embryonic signaling pathway, namely the canonical Wnt cascade, is still controversial. Here, we use gene array analysis as a platform to demonstrate general activation of the canonical arm of the Wnt pathway in human PDA. Furthermore, we provide evidence for Wnt activation in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. Our results also indicate that Wnt signaling might be activated downstream of Hedgehog signaling, which is an early event in PDA evolution. Wnt inhibition blocked proliferation and induced apoptosis of cultured adenocarcinoma cells, thereby providing evidence to support the development of novel therapeutical strategies for Wnt inhibition in pancreatic adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2146649239,"Interactions between stem cells and their surrounding microenvironment, or niche, are critical for the establishment and maintenance of stem-cell properties. The adult Drosophila testis contains a morphologically discrete stem-cell niche, the 'hub'. The small cluster of non-dividing, somatic hub cells at the anterior tip of the fly testis is contacted by the germline stem cells (GSCs), which retain their stem-cell character through the direct association with the hub. Here we show that integrin-mediated adhesion is important for maintaining the correct position of embryonic hub cells during gonad morphogenesis. The misplaced hub in integrin-deficient embryos directs the orientation of cell divisions in the presumptive GSCs, a hallmark of the active germline stem-cell niche. A decrease in integrin-mediated adhesion in adult testes, which resulted in a loss of the hub and the stem-cell population, revealed the importance of hub-cell anchoring. Finally, we show that an extracellular matrix (ECM) is present around the gonad during late embryogenesis and that this ECM is defective in integrin-deficient gonads. On the basis of our data, we propose that integrins are required for the attachment of the hub cells to the ECM, which is essential for maintaining the stem-cell niche."
https://openalex.org/W2041426722,"In humans and many other animals, memory consolidation occurs through multiple temporal phases and usually involves more than one neuroanatomical brain system. Genetic dissection of Pavlovian olfactory learning in Drosophila melanogaster has revealed multiple memory phases, but the predominant view holds that all memory phases occur in mushroom body neurons. Here, we demonstrate an acute requirement for NMDA receptors (NMDARs) outside of the mushroom body during long-term memory (LTM) consolidation. Targeted dsRNA-mediated silencing of Nmdar1 and Nmdar2 (also known as dNR1 or dNR2, respectively) in cholinergic R4m-subtype large-field neurons of the ellipsoid body specifically disrupted LTM consolidation, but not retrieval. Similar silencing of functional NMDARs in the mushroom body disrupted an earlier memory phase, leaving LTM intact. Our results clearly establish an anatomical site outside of the mushroom body involved with LTM consolidation, thus revealing both a distributed brain system subserving olfactory memory formation and the existence of a system-level memory consolidation in Drosophila."

https://openalex.org/W2077792283,"Loss of function mutations in progranulin cause tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. A major protein component of these inclusions is TDP-43, which becomes hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments, which apparently translocate from nuclei to the cytoplasm. Most progranulin mutations are nonsense mutations resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and consequently reduced progranulin protein levels. However, some missense mutations are described that occur within the signal sequence and mature progranulin. We now demonstrate that a progranulin mutation located within the signal sequence (PGRN A9D) results in cytoplasmic missorting with extremely low expression. In contrast, two other progranulin mutations (PGRN P248L and R432C) are expressed as immature proteins but are inefficiently transported through and partially degraded within the secretory pathway, resulting in a significantly reduced secretion. Thus apparently all progranulin mutations cause reduced protein expression or secretion, although by different cellular mechanisms. To investigate a putative relationship between reduced expression of progranulin and TDP-43 relocalization and deposition, we down-regulated progranulin in human cell lines and in zebrafish. Upon reduction of progranulin, neither a major redistribution of TDP-43 nor proteolytic processing to disease-characterizing C-terminal fragments could be observed.

In these neurodegenerative disorders, proteins, which are normally soluble are known to misfold because of proteolytic processing and/or abnormal posttranslational modifications. Such insoluble amyloidogenic proteins are often deposited and may form reservoirs for neurotoxic oligomers (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar). FTLD, which accounts approximately for 15% of all dementias, is characterized by two different types of cellular inclusions. About 40% of FTLD cases have tau-positive inclusions (2Baker M. Mackenzie I.R. Pickering-Brown S.M. Gass J. Rademakers R. Lindholm C. Snowden J. Adamson J. Sadovnick A.D. Rollinson S. Cannon A.

Genetic linkage led to the identification of more than 40 different mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau gene locus on chromosome 17 (4Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A. Grover A. Hackett J. Adamson J. Lincoln S. Dickson D. Davies P. Petersen R.C. Stevens M. de Graaff E. Wauters E. van Baren J.

Nature. 1998; 393: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar). However, a number of familial FTLD cases failed to exhibit mutations in the tau gene, although strong linkage to chromosome 17 was observed (5Rademakers R. Cruts M. Dermaut B. Sleegers K. Rosso S.M. Van den Broeck M. Backhovens H. van Swieten J. van Duijn C.M. Van Broeckhoven C. Mol. Psychiatry. 2002; 7: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These cases were characterized by tau- and α-synuclein-negative, ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions (3Neary D. Snowden J.S. Mann D.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The inclusions are observed in the frontotemporal cortex, the temporal neocortex, and the hippocampus and define the frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-U). FTLD-U is the most frequent neuropathological form of FTLD and presents with progressive social, behavioral symptoms, and language dysfunction. Patients may also develop typical symptoms of motoneuron diseases. Most recently, the major protein component of the ubiquitin-positive inclusions was identified as TDP-43 (the TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa) (6Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

Insoluble, hyperphosphorylated, and proteolytically processed C-terminal fragments of the nuclear TDP-43 were found as the disease-characterizing signature and shown to accumulate in most FTLD-U cases within the cytoplasm of neurons (7Neumann M.

TDP-43 has initially been identified as a DNA-binding protein (12Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition TDP-43 contains two RNA recognition motifs and is able to bind UG repeats in RNA (13Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Consistent with its putative RNA binding properties TDP-43 may also be part of a protein complex involved in RNA splicing (13Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E.

Based on these putative nuclear functions, the deposition of TDP-43 within the cytoplasm in FTLD-U and its corresponding absence within nuclei appears to be rather surprising, raising the possibility that some essential normal function of TDP-43 may be lost in FTLD-U.Chromosome 17-associated familial FTLD-U cases are linked to PGRN (progranulin), a gene located close to the microtubule-associated protein tau gene locus (2Baker M. Mackenzie I.R. Pickering-Brown S.M. Gass J. Rademakers R. Lindholm C. Snowden J. Adamson J. Sadovnick A.D. Rollinson S. Cannon A. Dwosh E. Neary D. Melquist S. Richardson A. Dickson D. Berger Z.

PGRN is a secreted protein that probably serves as a growth factor (18Zanocco-Marani T. Bateman A. Romano G. Valentinis B. He Z.H. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5331-5340PubMed Google Scholar, 19He Z. Ong C.H. Halper J. Bateman A. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) but is not a component of the pathological inclusions in FTLD-U. It contains seven and a half granulin domains composed of 12 cysteine-rich tandem repeat motifs (see also Fig. 2A). PGRN exists as a secreted full-length protein, which can be converted into several granulins via proteolytic processing by elastase (20He Z. Bateman A. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). PGRN may act as a wound-healing factor, although the granulins and the full-length PGRN may have opposite functions in wound repair and inflammation (21Ahmed Z. Mackenzie I.R. Hutton M.L. Dickson D.W. J. Neuroinflammation. 2007; 4: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Alzheimer disease, PGRN is up-regulated in activated microglia around amyloid plaques (2Baker M. Mackenzie I.R. Pickering-Brown S.M. Gass J. Rademakers R. Lindholm C. Snowden J.

Because the PGRN gene was associated with many cases of FTLD-U, and all of these cases show TDP-43-positive inclusions, it has been speculated that haploinsufficiency of PGRN may be responsible for TDP-43 mislocalization, deposition, and proteolytic fragmentation. To prove these hypotheses, we first investigated the consequences of three missense mutations on PGRN expression and transport. In addition we down-regulated PGRN in human cell lines and in zebrafish and searched for a change in subcellular localization and processing of TDP-43.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—For the detection of TDP-43 and PGRN by immunoblotting, the following antibodies were used: a rabbit polyclonal anti-TDP-43 antibody (TARDBP; Proteintech Group, 1:2000) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-PGRN antibody (PCDGF antibody 40-3400; Zymed Laboratories, 1:250). Myc-tagged PGRN was detected with the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz). β-Actin was detected using the mouse monoclonal antibody (A-5316; Sigma, 1:2000). Immunocytochemistry was performed with the following antibodies. For the detection of TDP-43, a mouse monoclonal (TARDBP 2E2-D3; Abnova, 1:200) and a rabbit polyclonal (Proteintech Group, 1:200) antibody were used. PGRN was detected by a rabbit polyclonal (PCDGF antibody 40-3400; Zymed Laboratories, 1:100) and a mouse monoclonal (MAB2420; R & D Systems, 1:500) anti-PGRN antibody. For endoplasmic reticulum labeling a monoclonal anti-BIP antibody was used (SPA-827; StressGene, 1:200) and for Golgi staining, an anti-giantin antibody was used at 1:1000 as described before (27Capell A.

All of the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin. The transfections were carried out as described by the manufacturer using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mix (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate).

For SDS extracts cell pellets were directly lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection, the indicated antibodies were used. Bound antibodies were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences).Tunicamycin Treatment—To block the glycosylation of progranulin, the cells were treated with 10 μgml-1 tunicamycin for 5 h. The samples were separated on an SDS gel and analyzed by immunoblotting using the polyclonal anti-progranulin antibody.Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—To analyze expression and maturation of PGRN, HeLa cells were starved for 1 h in methionine-, cysteine-, and serum-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) and subsequently metabolically pulse-labeled with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix; Amersham Biosciences) in methionine-, cysteine-, and serum-free medium for 15 or 30 min as indicated and chased in the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled methionine for the indicated time points. PGRN was immunoprecipitated from medium and cell lysates using the monoclonal anti-progranulin antibody. Quantification was performed by phosphorimaging (PhosphorImager; Molecular Dynamics).Immunohistochemistry—HeLa cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips, fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton in PBS with 50 mm NH4Cl, and subsequently blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS. The cells were then double stained with indicated mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing repeatedly with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488 and Alexa 555 (Invitrogen) coupled secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies as indicated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently the cells were washed with PBS, and the nucleus was labeled using TopRo-3 (monomeric cyanine nucleic acid stain, 1:1000; Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol (Hoechst) supplemented with 0.5% DABCO (Sigma), and the images were obtained using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope. Fish embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C and then paraffin-embedded. 5-μm sections were cut and used for hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. For TDP-43 immunohistochemistry using rabbit polyclonal anti-TDP-43 antibody (1:2000), antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the sections in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven (3 × 5 min). Immunohistochemistry was carried out using the avidin-biotin complex detection system (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine as chromogen.cDNA Constructs—cDNA constructs encoding human PGRN (clone IRATp970H1136D6, from RZPD) were subcloned into the EcoRV and Not1 sites of the pcDNA 3.1 (+) hygro expression vector (Invitrogen). Myc-tagged PGRN wt or PGRN A9D was generated by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA 4 Myc-his (B) expression vector (Invitrogen). The PGRN point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing.Transient siRNA Knockdown of PGRN—The PGRN knockdown in HeLa cells was achieved using Ambion Silencer pre-designed siRNAs 144869, 10849, and 11032. Nontargeting siRNA negative control 7 was used to assess unspecific effects of siRNA delivery. HeLa cells were seeded on polylysine-coated dishes or coverslips. The cells were then transfected with 20 μm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 and analyzed 48 h post transfection.Animal Husbandry—All of the experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the German Council on Animal Care. Zebrafish were maintained, mated, and raised as described (28Mullins M.C. Hammerschmidt M. Haffter P. Nusslein-Volhard C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 189-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The embryos were kept at 28 °C and staged as described (29Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8541) Google Scholar). The wild type line AB was used for all of the experiments.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridizations were carried out as described elsewhere (30Schulte-Merker S. Ho R.K. Herrmann B.G. Nusslein-Volhard C. Development. 1992; 116: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The single-stranded RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Applied Science). All of the washing steps were carried out at 65 °C. The washes were as follows: twice for 30 min in 50% formamide, 2× SSCT (standard saline citrate + 0.1% Tween); once for 15 min in 2× SSCT, twice for 30 min in 0.2× SSCT. To reduce endogenous phosphatase activity, 0.25 mg ml-1 levamisole was added to the staining buffer.Design of Antisense gripNAs and Microinjection of Zebrafish Embryos—Rhodamine-labeled antisense gripNA of 18 nucleotides in length targeting zebrafish granulinB was obtained from active motif. The grip was designed against the exon-intron junction between exon 6 and intron 6-7. The underlined nucleotides refer to the start GT of intron 6-7: granulinB GT-grip, 5′-TATGTGATGCACCTTTGG-3′. The embryos were microinjected using a Femto Jet Microinjector (Eppendorf) at the one-cell stage with gripNA concentration of 1.0 μm. The injected volume was 2-4 pl.RT-PCR—Zebrafish embryos injected with granulinB GT-grip and wt controls were fixed in liquid nitrogen after the following time points: 14-15 hours post-fertilization and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dpf. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared from the RNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). PCRs were carried out using the cycle conditions starting with 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The following primers were used: zfGRNBex4For (P1), 5′-GTGTGCTGTGATGATAGGAAACACT-3′; zfGRNBex6AFor (P2), 5′-TCCAGATAAGATTTCCAAATGTCC-3′; zfGRNBex7Arev (P3), 5′-AGAACAGTGACAGCTGGGATTT-3′; zfActinFor, 5′-TGTTTTCCCCTCCATTGTTGG-3′; zfActinrev, 5′-TTCTCCTTGATGTCACGGAC-3′; zfTDP-43exon3F1, 5′-GCCAGATAATAAGAGGAAGATGGA-3′, and zfTDP-43exon4R1, 5′-CCGCTGTGTCATCACCTTAC-3′. Primers P1/P3 are located on exons 4 and 7, respectively, and amplify a PCR product of 404 bp (base pairs). Primers P2/P3 are located on exon 6 and 7, respectively, and amplify a PCR product of 214 bp. zfActin primers amplify a PCR product of 550 bp, whereas zfTarbdbp (zfTDP) amplify a PCR product of 262 bp on cDNA and 457 bp on genomic DNA.RESULTSExpression of Endogenous PGRN and TDP-43 in Cultured Cells—We first investigated the expression of endogenous wt PGRN and TDP-43 in HeLa and HEK 293T cells. In cell lysates PGRN was found predominantly to be an immature species (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this finding, the secreted PGRN species have a higher molecular weight (Fig. 1A), reflecting mature fully glycosylated PGRN (31Zhou J. Gao G. Crabb J.W. Serrero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10863-10869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low abundance of mature PGRN within cell lysates suggests rapid and efficient secretion. In the same lysates endogenous TDP-43 was detected as an ∼43-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). As expected no TDP-43 was found to be secreted.FIGURE 1Cellular expression of endogenous PGRN and TDP-43. A, lysates and conditioned media of indicated cell lines were investigated for PGRN expression by immunoblotting. Note that PGRN occurs as two variants, probably reflecting immature (arrowheads) and fully mature glycosylated species (arrow). The mature species accumulates in conditioned media. The bottom panel shows a lower exposure of the upper panel. B, TDP-43 is expressed as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa. As expected, TDP-43 is only found in cell lysates. 50 μg of protein was loaded for each sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PGRN Missense Mutations P248L and R432C Affect Secretion—Nonsense mutations in PGRN result in haploinsufficiency caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (2Baker M.

https://openalex.org/W1970687486,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 has a biphasic effect on rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells. By itself, TGF-β1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the growth, migration and invasion of RIE cells. We show in this study that in conjunction with epidermal growth factor (EGF), TGF-β1 helped to augment migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth (AIG) compared to that by EGF alone. EGF plus TGF-β1 induced a dramatic morphological change characteristic of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanism for this enhanced effect of TGF-β1 and EGF on oncogenic properties was explored by analysis of EGF- and TGF-β1-mediated signaling pathways and complementary DNA arrays. TGF-β1 augmented EGF-mediated signaling of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT by enhancing and prolonging the activation of the former and prolonging the activation of the latter. Inhibition of MAPK, but not phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), abolished TGF-β1 plus EGF-induced EMT and downregulation of E-cadherin at mRNA and protein levels. By contrast, cell migration and invasion were sensitive to inhibition of either MAPK or PI3 kinase. TGF-β1 plus EGF-induced AIG was significantly more resistant to inhibition of PI3K and MAPK compared to that induced by EGF alone. EGF and TGF-β1 synergistically induced the expression of a series of proteases including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 (collagenase), MMP3, MMP9, MMP10, MMP14 and cathepsin. Among them, the expression of MMP1, MMP3, MMP9 and MMP10 was MAPK dependent. Inhibition of the MMPs or cathepsin significantly blocked EGF plus TGF-β1-induced invasion, but had no effect on colony formation. Phospholipase C (PLC) and Cox2 induced by EGF plus TGF-β1 also played a significant role in invasion, whereas PLC was also important for colony formation. Our study reveals specific signaling functions and induction of genes differentially required for enhanced effect of EGF- and TGF-β1-induced oncogenic properties, and helps to explain the tumor-promoting effect of TGF-β1 in human cancer with elevated expression or activation of TGF-β1 and receptor protein tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2000231468,"Recombinant polypeptides and protein domains containing two cysteine pairs located distal in primary sequence but proximal in the native folded or assembled state are labeled selectively in vitro and in mammalian cells using the profluorescent biarsenical reagents FlAsH-EDT2 and ReAsH-EDT2. This strategy, termed bipartite tetracysteine display, enables the detection of protein-protein interactions and alternative protein conformations in live cells. As proof of principle, we show that the equilibrium stability and fluorescence intensity of polypeptide–biarsenical complexes correlates with the thermodynamic stability of the protein fold or assembly. Destabilized protein variants form less stable and less bright biarsenical complexes, which allows discrimination of live cells expressing folded polypeptide and protein domains from those containing disruptive point mutations. Bipartite tetracysteine display may provide a means to detect early protein misfolding events associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and cystic fibrosis; it may also enable high-throughput screening of compounds that stabilize discrete protein folds."

Using the crystal structure of the Na+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coli (EcNhaA) as a template, we predicted the three-dimensional structure of human Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). Modeling was particularly challenging because of the extremely low sequence identity between these proteins, but the model structure is supported by evolutionary conservation analysis and empirical data. It also revealed the location of the binding site of NHE inhibitors; which we validated by conducting mutagenesis studies with EcNhaA and its specific inhibitor 2-aminoperimidine.

Sodium/hydrogen transporters are ubiquitous transmembrane (TM) 3The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembraneEcNhaANa+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coliNHE1Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1APaminoperimidineMSAmultiple sequence alignment 3The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembraneEcNhaANa+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coliNHE1Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1APaminoperimidineMSAmultiple sequence alignment proteins that transport Na+ and H+ ions across the membrane, and are therefore imperative for vital cellular processes such as regulation of cellular pH, cell volume, and ion composition (1Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) family of transporters includes nine isoforms (NHE1 through NHE9), of which NHE1 is the most widely expressed. Following allosteric activation by intracellular acidification, NHE1 exchanges extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+ with Na+:H+ stoichiometry of 1:1 (2Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). NHE1 is inhibited by amiloride and its derivatives and by benzoyl guanidium compounds such as cariporide (1Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Structurally, NHE1 is predicted to include two distinct domains: a TM N-terminal region of ∼500 amino acids that is involved in ion translocation and drug recognition, and a cytoplasmic regulatory C-terminal domain of nearly 300 residues (3Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain includes the H+ sensor and also serves to mediate regulation by other molecules or ions. transmembrane Na+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coli Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 aminoperimidine multiple sequence alignment transmembrane Na+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coli Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 aminoperimidine multiple sequence alignment NHE1 is associated with many pathological conditions that include cancer as well as heart, vascular, gastric, and kidney diseases (1Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). For example, the activity of NHE1 is primarily involved in the damage inflicted on the human myocardium during and following a myocardial infarction, and accordingly, NHE1 inhibitors were shown to be beneficial during ischemia and reperfusion (1Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, NHE1 plays a role in tumor growth by reversing the pH gradient in malignant cells, a phenomenon known as “malignant acidosis,” which is a key step in oncogenic transformation. Therefore, NHE1 inhibitors can potentially serve as anti-cancer drugs (1Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). NhaA, the main Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli (EcNhaA), is indispensable for bacterial growth in alkaline pH (in the presence of Na+) and for adaptation to high salinity (4Padan E. Bibi E. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1717: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). EcNhaA is an electrogenic antiporter extracting one Na+ ion from the cell in return for inward current of two protons following cellular alkalization (4Padan E. Bibi E. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1717: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The function of EcNhaA is specifically inhibited by 2-aminoperimidine (AP), a guanidine-containing naphthalene derivative with some similarity to the NHE1 inhibitor amiloride (5Dibrov P. Rimon A. Dzioba J. Winogrodzki A. Shalitin Y. Padan E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of EcNhaA was recently determined, and found to comprise 12 TM segments (6Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The bacterial EcNhaA and eukaryotic Na+/H+ exchangers play similar roles in controlling pH and electrolyte homeostasis, and have been suggested to share a common ancestor and a similar structural fold (1Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 7Brett C.L. Donowitz M. Rao R. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C223-C239Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Thus, our working hypothesis was that EcNhaA can be utilized as a template to predict the structure of the TM domain of NHE1. However, the proteins share very low sequence identity of about 10%, and it is not a simple matter to align their sequences and to predict the structure of NHE1 based on that of EcNhaA (8Forrest L.R. Tang C.L. Honig B. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 508-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this study, by using a fold-recognition approach, we obtained a three-dimensional model of NHE1. Notably, the membrane topology of this model structure differs from the one that was suggested on the basis of hydrophobicity scales and cysteine accessibility analysis (9Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Reasons for the differences are discussed below. Our model of NHE1, which is supported by both phylogenetic and empirical data, incorporates the binding pocket of clinically important NHE inhibitors. This allowed us to locate the binding site of the AP inhibitor within the EcNhaA structure by site-directed mutagenesis. Finally, the integration of empirical data with the new structural model allowed us to suggest an alternating-access mechanism of the Na+/H+ exchange in molecular detail (Fig. 1A).

A, the effect of AP inhibition on the antiporter activity of EcNhaA mutants compared with wild-type. The results obtained for the F71C and N64C mutations showing the most drastic AP effect are displayed. Everted membrane vesicles were isolated from EP432 cells expressing wild-type NhaA or the indicated mutants, and the Na+/H+ or Li+/H+ antiporter activity was measured at pH 7.5. At the onset of the reaction, membranes were added first and then Tris d-lactate (2 mm) (↓), and the fluorescent quenching (Q) was recorded until a steady state level of ΔpH (100% quenching) was reached. NaCl or LiCl, at the indicated concentrations, was then added (↑), and the new steady state of fluorescence obtained (dequenching) after each addition was monitored. Where indicated, AP, at the indicated concentrations, was added (↑), to the reaction mixture following the addition of the membranes. The experiments were repeated at least three times with practically identical results. Calculated IC50 is shown for each experiment. B, the crystal structure of EcNhaA (6Hunte C. Screpanti E.

Space-filled atoms represent residues that were examined for their involvement in AP binding (Table 1).

Rychlewski L. Li Z. Li W. Godzik A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W284-W288Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This finding strengthened our working hypothesis that the TM domains of the two exchangers share a similar fold. Use of Multiple Approaches to Align the TM Domains of NHE1 and EcNhaA—The sequence identity between EcNhaA and human NHE1 is only ∼10%, and we were unable to align their sequences using standard methods (data not shown). We therefore used several state-of-the-art approaches to construct alignments, and integrated the results. First, we extracted the pairwise alignment between NHE1 and EcNhaA, which displays 12.4% sequence identity, from a multiple-sequence alignment of a clan of transporters from the Pfam data base (14Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional pairwise alignments were calculated using the FFAS03 (13Jaroszewski L. Rychlewski L. Li Z. Li W. Godzik A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W284-W288Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and HMAP (15Tang C.L. Xie L. Koh I.Y. Posy S. Alexov E. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 1043-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) servers, which display 9.2 and 10.4% sequence identity, respectively. The procedures are described in the supplemental data. TM Helix Assignment—We used each of the above alignments to assign the boundaries of 12 TM segments (TM1-TM12) of NHE1, based on corresponding segments of the crystal structure of EcNhaA. Fig. 2 exemplifies the significant similarity between most of the TM segments predicted by the Pfam, FFAS03, and HMAP alignments. Using the iterative process described below, we predicted the final membrane topology (highlighted in yellow in Fig. 2 and illustrated in Fig. 3A). Initially, the three different alignments were manually adjusted to reduce gaps in the TM helices of EcNhaA, and used to build three-dimensional models of NHE1. The main dissimilarity between the different alignment methods appeared to be in the prediction of the TM6 and TM7 segments. The model structures provided additional information that was used to favor a specific assignment and improve it further; model structures that were favored were those with least polar residues facing the lipid bilayer. Such considerations favored adaptation of the Pfam assignment of TM6; they were not helpful, however, in assigning TM7, for which we therefore used information from a multiple-sequence alignment of homologous eukaryotic Na+/H+ exchangers. Because TM helices are expected not to include insertions and deletions of amino acids (8Forrest L.R. Tang C.L. Honig B. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 508-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we favored the assignment of TM7 to a gap-free region, as predicted by FFAS03 and HMAP alignments but not by Pfam. Similar reasoning led us to reject the assignment of the first TM segment to residues 103-127, although that was the assignment predicted by all three methods (Fig. 2), because this segment is highly variable and includes many insertions and deletions. In contrast, the next segment (residues 129-150), which was predicted by hydrophobicity analysis (9Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) to be a TM segment, is devoid of gaps. Interestingly, the conservation pattern in this region is compatible with the periodicity of a helix, i.e. a conserved residue appears at every fourth position, resulting in a conserved helical face (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, this was the region to which we assigned TM1. The above helix assignment of NHE1 was used to refine the pairwise alignment between NHE1 and EcNhaA in the TM regions. The final pairwise alignment displays 10.6% sequence identity (supplemental data Fig. 1S). A three-dimensional model of NHE1 was subsequently constructed on the basis of this alignment and the EcNhaA template. An analysis pertaining to the three-dimensional location of the identical residues between NHE1 and EcNhaA is presented in the supplemental data. The Three-dimensional Model of NHE1 Is Compatible with Evolutionary Conservation Analyses of Na+/H+ Exchangers—In helical proteins, evolutionarily conserved amino acids are typically located in strategic regions at the interfaces between the TM segments, whereas variable residues face the membrane lipids. The extra-membranal loops are also enriched in variable amino acids (16Briggs J.A. Torres J. Arkin I. Proteins. 2001; 44: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Hurwitz N.

Sci. 2006; 31: 106-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Accordingly, analyses of evolutionary conservation have been used to predict the structures of membrane proteins (19Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol.

Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). They have also been exploited to validate model structures (23Fleishman S.J. Ben-Tal N. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 2006; 16: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as in the present study. We mapped the conservation scores calculated on the basis of the alignment of 94 sequences comprising the bacterial NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter family on the crystal structure of EcNhaA (6Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B, a and b). As expected, the most highly conserved residues are at the inter-helix interfaces within the TM region, whereas the most variable residues are located in the periphery; where they face the lipid membrane and populate the extra-membranal loops. Reassuringly, a very similar pattern was observed for our model structure of NHE1 (Fig. 3B, c and d). The results, obtained using an alignment of 305 Na+/H+ exchangers related to NHE1, strongly support our NHE1 model structure. Interestingly, a cluster of titratable residues (Fig. 4, A and B), all evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 4, C and D), is located within the conserved core in the center of the membrane in each of the structures. Titratable residues are very rare in the membrane, presumably because of the large desolvation free energy associated with their transfer from the aqueous phase into the membrane (24Bowie J.U. Nature. 2005; 438: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 25von Heijne G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Their presence in the membrane is often associated with function (26Murtazina R. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4674-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These titratable residues were indeed shown to be essential for the activity of both transporters (27Galili L. Herz K. Dym O. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23104-23113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Kozachkov L. Herz K. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2419-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (supplemental data Tables 1S and 2S) and arguably are involved in conformational changes and cation translocation (please see “Discussion” and Fig. 1 for a detailed description of the role of these residues). The NHE1 Model Structure Is Consistent with the Positive-Inside Rule—Gunnar von Heijne and his co-workers (25von Heijne G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) showed that the topology of the vast majority of TM proteins is such that amino acid positions at the intracellular ends are enriched in the positively charged residues, lysine and arginine, relative to the extracellular side. This observation, termed the positive-inside rule, can be used to predict and evaluate the topology of membrane proteins. Analysis of the NHE1 three-dimensional model (incorporating residues 126-505) revealed 12 lysine/arginine residues on the cytoplasmic side and only 3 lysine residues on the extracellular side (Fig. 3A). For reference, EcNhaA includes 16 lysine/arginine residues on the cytoplasmic side and 5 on the extracellular side (6Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The NHE1 Model Structure Is Consistent with Mutagenesis Studies—Classical genetic and biochemical experiments and site-directed mutagenesis studies of eukaryotic Na+/H+ exchangers (supplemental data Tables 1S and 2S) have yielded abundant data. For simplicity, we divided these data into two main groups: residues that are essential for function versus those that are unessential. Residues were considered essential if their replacement resulted in loss or change of function (e.g. ion-translocation and pH-regulation), or if they were shown to be involved in binding of inhibitors. When these mutagenesis data are projected on the NHE1 model structure, it can be seen that most of the residues defined as essential for activity are located in the core of the TM domain (Fig. 5), which is consistent with their role in maintaining the architecture and function of the transporter. On the other hand, most of the unessential residues face the membrane or are located in the extra-membranal loops. One essential residue, Ser351, unexpectedly faces the membrane lipids, and its functional relevance will be discussed below. Residues that participate in pH regulation, and thus mediate cellular signals, are located both on a cytoplasmic loop and within the protein core. Mutagenesis studies point to 14 residues whose replacement affects the sensitivity of NHE1 to its inhibitors (Table 1S). Some of these mutations do not affect Na+ affinity, implying that the inhibitor-binding site is physically distinct and suggesting that the inhibitors induce allosteric regulation (30Ding J. Rainey J.K. Xu C. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29817-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We focused on residues whose replacement significantly alters sensitivity to NHE inhibitors (i.e. by more than 10-fold), and which are likely to be directly involved in the binding. Specifically, mutagenesis implies that the binding site incorporates residues Phe161, Phe162, and Leu163, all located in TM2, and a second region comprising Gly352 of TM8 and Glu346 on its preceding loop (Fig. 5 and Table 1S). These two regions are located close to each other in our model, and Leu163 (TM2) is in direct contact with Glu346 and Gly352 (Fig. 5). Moreover, this binding site is situated at the extracellular side of NHE1, in accordance with the location of the inhibitors (31Counillon L. Noel J. Reithmeier R.A. Pouyssegur J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All in all, our NHE1 model structure is in excellent agreement with the mutagenesis data. We note that our model was built independently of the mutagenesis data. The final alignment that was used to construct the structural model is very similar to the initial alignments that were obtained using purely computational methods (presented in Fig. 2). Therefore, the projection of the mutagenesis data on models constructed based on these alignments, which are totally independent of prior knowledge regarding the mutations, show similar results (an example is provided in supplemental Fig. 4S). Mutations that alter the binding affinity of the NHE inhibitors were located in equivalent positions in a few eukaryotic NHE isoforms, implying that these isoforms share a common binding site (Tables 1S and 2S). Thus, we assumed by extrapolation that the AP inhibitor of EcNhaA binds to an equivalent location on EcNhaA. Accordingly, we designed and isolated seven mutations in residues located in TM2 and TM8 of EcNhaA and examined the sensitivity of their Na+ or Li+/H+ activity to AP inhibition (Table 1 and Fig. 6). The Na+/H+ antiport activity was measured in everted membrane vesicles isolated from EP432 transformed with the plasmids encoding the various mutations. EP432 lacks the chromosome-encoded antiporters (EcNhaA and EcNhaB) and expresses only the EcNhaA variants from a plasmid. Addition of the respiratory substrate, lactate, to these membrane vesicles (downward-facing arrow in Fig. 6) resulted in generation of ΔpH, as monitored by quenching of the fluorescence of acridine orange, a fluorescent probe of ΔpH. Addition of either Na+ or Li+ to the reaction mixture (upward-facing arrow in Fig. 6) initiated the Na+ or Li+/H+ antiport activity, as monitored by dequenching of the fluorescence. EP432 transformed with plasmid pAXH (32Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or the vector plasmid pBR322 served as positive and negative controls, respectively. To determine the effect of AP on the antiport activity, we added the inhibitor at various concentrations before adding lactate. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of AP was determined as described (5Dibrov P. Rimon A. Dzioba J. Winogrodzki A. Shalitin Y. Padan E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).TABLE"
https://openalex.org/W2094815521,"The ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase is a key transducer of DNA damage signals within the genome maintenance machinery and a tumour suppressor whose germline mutations predispose to familial breast cancer. ATM signalling is constitutively activated in early stages of diverse types of human malignancies and cell culture models in response to oncogene-induced DNA damage providing a barrier against tumour progression. As BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also components of the genome maintenance network and their mutations predispose to breast cancer, we have examined the ATM expression in human breast carcinomas of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, sporadic cases and familial non-BRCA1/2 patients. Our results show that ATM protein expression is aberrantly reduced more frequently among BRCA1 (33%; P=0.0003) and BRCA2 (30%; P=0.0009) tumours than in non-BRCA1/2 tumours (10.7%). Furthermore, the non-BRCA1/2 tumours with reduced ATM expression were more often estrogen receptor (ER) negative (P=0.0002), progesterone receptor (PR) negative (P=0.004) and were of higher grade (P=0.0004). In our series of 1013 non-BRCA1/2 cases, ATM was more commonly deficient (20%; P=0.0006) and p53 was overabundant (47%; P<0.0000000001) among the difficult-to-treat ER/PR/ERBB2-triple-negative subset of tumours compared with cases that expressed at least one of these receptors (10 and 16% of aberrant ATM and p53, respectively). We propose a model of 'conditional haploinsufficiency' for BRCA1/2 under conditions of enhanced DNA damage in precancerous lesions resulting in more robust activation and hence increased selection for inactivation or loss of ATM in tumours of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, with implications for genomic instability and curability of diverse subsets of human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1982296800,"LSECtin is a member of the C-type lectin family of glycan-binding receptors that is expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver and lymph nodes. To compare the sugar and pathogen binding properties of LSECtin with those of related but more extensively characterized receptors, such as DC-SIGN, a soluble fragment of LSECtin consisting of the C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain has been expressed in bacteria. A biotin-tagged version of the protein was also generated and complexed with streptavidin to create tetramers. These forms of the carbohydrate-recognition domain were used to probe a glycan array and to characterize binding to oligosaccharide and glycoprotein ligands. LSECtin binds with high selectivity to glycoproteins terminating in GlcNAcβ1-2Man. The inhibition constant for this disaccharide is 3.5 μm, making it one of the best low molecular weight ligands known for any C-type lectin. As a result of the selective binding of this disaccharide unit, the receptor recognizes glycoproteins with a truncated complex and hybrid N-linked glycans on glycoproteins. Glycan analysis of the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus reveals the presence of such truncated glycans, explaining the ability of LSECtin to facilitate infection by Ebola virus. High mannose glycans are also present on the viral glycoprotein, which explains why DC-SIGN also binds to this virus.

Mammalian glycan binding receptors interact with endogenous glycans on cells and secreted glycoproteins and with sugar structures on the surfaces of pathogenic microorganisms (1Varki A. Cummings R.

Endocytosis mediated by sugar-specific receptors results in clearance of glycoproteins from circulation, so these receptors can participate in normal turnover of serum glycoproteins and in the scavenging of glycoproteins released as a result of damage to tissues (3Drickamer K.

In both cases the distinct but overlapping roles of the different receptors remain poorly defined. LSECtin is a recently described member of the C-type family of receptors that is found predominantly on sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver and lymph nodes, suggesting that it plays a specific role in these cells (9Liu W.

LSECtin shares with these receptors the ability to bind to surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses.

DC-SIGNR, which shows a similar cellular distribution to LSECtin, also binds to Ebola virus, so there is potential overlap in their functions (15Alvarez C.P. Lasala F. Carrillo J. Muñiz O.

To clarify the differential interactions of LSECtin and the other, better characterized receptors, the binding specificity of LSECtin has been investigated by probing a glycan array and by employing other assays for sugar binding activity. It is demonstrated that the most effective glycan ligands for LSECtin contain the disaccharide sequence GlcNAcβ1-2Man. Analysis of the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein shows the presence of both this target structure and high mannose oligosaccharides, which would account for the ability of LSECtin as well as DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR to bind to the viral glycoprotein. Expression of the Carbohydrate-recognition Domain from LSECtin—A cDNA for LSECtin was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a human liver cDNA library from BD Biosciences. Synthetic oligonucleotides from Invitrogen were combined with restriction fragments from the cDNA to insert the region encoding the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) into a modified version of the vector ompA2 (18Grayeb J. Kimura H. Takahara M. Hsiung H. Masui Y. Inouye M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The codons for the bacterial ompA signal sequence were followed immediately by the cDNA sequence beginning at residue 160 of LSECtin, which encodes the sequence NSC at the N-terminal end of the CRD. For expression of biotin-tagged protein, the C-terminal end of the cDNA was similarly modified by insertion of synthetic oligonucleotides so that the expression vector codes for a protein in which the C-terminal cysteine residue of LSECtin is followed by the sequence GLN-DIFEAEKIETHE (19Schatz P.J. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The CRD of LSECtin was expressed in Escherichia coli strain JA221 grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. For the addition of biotin, the cells were also transformed with plasmid birA, which contains the gene for biotin ligase (20Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and chloramphenicol at 20 μg/ml was included in the medium. For protein production, a 200-ml starter culture was diluted to 6 liters and grown at 25 °C to an A550 of 0.8, at which point additions were made to achieve final concentrations of 10 μg/liter isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, 12.5 μg/ml biotin, and 100 mm CaCl2. After further growth overnight at 25 °C, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 4000 × g. The pelleted cells were suspended in 150 ml of loading buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8) and sonicated at full power with a Branson 250 sonicator five times for 2 min, with 30-min periods of cooling on ice between sonication steps. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g and 30 min at 150,000 × g, the supernatant was filtered through glass wool and applied to a 10-ml column of mannose- or fucose-Sepharose (21Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 16 ml of loading buffer and eluted in 2-ml fractions with elution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8). Formation of Streptavidin Complexes—Streptavidin obtained from Sigma was iodinated by the chloramine T method (22Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar) using Na125I from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Alexa 488-labeled streptavidin was purchased from the Molecular Probes division of Invitrogen. Approximately 250 μg of biotin-tagged CRD in 6 ml of eluting buffer was adjusted to 25 mm CaCl2 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 150 μg of labeled or unlabeled streptavidin. The complex was re-applied to a 1-ml column of fucose-Sepharose, which was rinsed with 5 ml of loading buffer and eluted with 0.5-ml aliquots of eluting buffer. Generation of Polyclonal Antibody—A sample of 1 mg of purified CRD from LSECtin without a biotin tag was provided to Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) for immunization of rabbits following their standard protocol. Expression of LSECtin in Fibroblasts—The full-length cDNA for LSECtin was inserted in to a retroviral expression vector that was used to generate pseudoviruses that were in turn used to infect Rat-6 fibroblasts following exactly the protocols previously described for other glycan-binding receptors (23Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Ward E.M. Stambach N.S. Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15450-15456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from two 225-cm2 flasks by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline and were pelleted by spinning at 2000 × g for 2 min. The pellet was suspended in 5 ml of eluting buffer containing 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 150 nm aprotinin, 1 μm E-64 protease inhibitor, and 1 μm leupeptin from Calbiochem and sonicated for 5 s at low power. Additions were made to bring the suspension to final concentrations of 1% Triton X-100 and 25 mm CaCl2 followed by a further 5-s sonication and incubation for 15 min on ice. The sample was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml column of fucose-Sepharose, which was rinsed with 4 ml of loading buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and eluted with 0.5-ml aliquots of eluting buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions were precipitated by the addition of half a volume of 30% trichloroacetic acid and incubation for 10 min on ice. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 18,000 × g, and the pellet was washed twice with 0.5 ml of ethanol:ether (1:1) and dried for 5 min under vacuum. The samples were dissolved directly in sample buffer and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were blotted onto nitrocellulose (25Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 30 min with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline, incubated for 90 min with primary antiserum at 1:500 dilution in the same buffer, washed with Tris-buffered saline, incubated with 20 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated protein A from Calbiochem in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% BSA, and finally washed again with Tris-buffered saline before incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-in-dolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate from Calbiochem. Screening for Glycan Ligands—The glycan array of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics was screened in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% BSA. Glycoprotein blotting was performed as previously described (26Fadden A.J. Holt O.J. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For competition binding assays (27Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pH dependence assays (28Wragg S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35400-35406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), polystyrene wells were coated with CRD from LSECtin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Oligosaccharides were obtained from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). Other Analytical Procedures—SDS-polyacrylamide gels were performed by the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Modeling of the LSECtin Binding Site—The structure of rat mannose-binding protein A in complex with a mannose-containing ligand, Protein Data Bank code 2msb, was modified by changing side chains to their LSECtin equivalents using Insight II software from Accelrys (Cambridge, UK). The GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharide was abstracted from chain A in entry 1fc1, and the mannose residue was superimposed on the mannose in the primary binding site of mannose-binding protein. The model figure was created using Molscript (31Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Analysis of LSECtin Binding to Cells Expressing Ebola Glycoprotein—To assess binding of soluble LSECtin to Ebola glycoprotein on the cell surface, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 encoding full-length Ebola glycoprotein (32Marzi A. Akhavan A. Simmons G. Gramberg T. Hofmann H. Bates P. Lingappa V.R. Pöhlmann S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6305-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or control vector without a cDNA insert. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal calf serum and 0.1% NaN3, and incubated with the indicated amounts of soluble, tetrameric Alexa 488-labeled LSECtin in the presence or absence of EDTA. Thereafter, the cells were again washed and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Production of Soluble Ebola Virus Glycoprotein—Soluble Ebola virus glycoprotein was produced by transient transfection of 293T cells with plasmid pAB61-ZEBOV-GP-Fc, which encodes the GP1 subunit of Ebola glycoprotein fused to the Fc portion of human IgG, as described previously (13Lai W.K. Sun P.J. Zhand J. Jennings A. Lalor P.F. Hubscher S. McKeating J.A. Adams D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 200-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The supernatant of the transfected cells was collected and passed through a HiTrap protein A column from GE Healthcare. Bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, mixed with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, and stored at -80 °C. The purity of the eluted samples was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Solid Phase Assay of LSECtin Binding to Ebola Glycoprotein—Streptavidin-coated wells from Perbio Sciences (Tattenhall, Cheshire, UK) were washed with loading buffer and incubated overnight with 100 μg/ml biotin-tagged CRD in loading buffer containing 0.1% BSA. Wells were washed twice with loading buffer and incubated for 6 h at room temperature with Ebola glycoprotein-Fc fusion protein at various dilutions. After three washes with loading buffer, wells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.1 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated protein A in loading buffer containing 0.1% BSA. After five further washes with loading buffer, wells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 100 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of p-nitrophenylphosphate in 0.1 m glycine, pH 10.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ZnCl2. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1.5 m NaOH, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read on a Wallac 1420 plate reader. Analysis of Glycans on Ebola Glycoprotein—Approximately 100 μg of Ebola glycoprotein-Fc fusion protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described above. The pellet was rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.4, and digested at 37 °C overnight by the addition of tosylphenyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin at 1 mg/ml. N- and O-linked glycans were released and purified as described previously (33Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Celis J.E. 3rd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 4. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2005: 415-425Google Scholar). Permethylation and sample repurification were performed using the sodium hydroxide protocol. Samples were redissolved in 10 μl of methanol:ultrapure water (4:1) and mixed in equal ratio with matrix (10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid). Both MALDI mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry were performed on an Applied Biosystems 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer. Molecular Structure of LSECtin—The sequence of the extracellular domain of LSECtin suggests that this portion of the molecule is divided into an extended neck region and a C-terminal CRD (Fig. 1). The importance of the C-terminal domain in binding to carbohydrate was confirmed by expression of this portion of the protein in a bacterial system. Based on the arrangement of disulfide bonds in other C-type CRDs, the N-terminal boundary of the expressed fragment was placed just before the first cysteine common to these domains. To enhance folding and disulfide bond formation, the polypeptide was fused to a bacterial signal sequence so that it would be directed to the periplasm. After expression in the presence of Ca2+, the protein was released from the bacteria by sonication. Based on previous studies indicating that the best monosaccharide ligand for LSECtin is mannose (9Liu W. Tang L. Zhang G. Wei H. Cui Y. Guo L. Gou Z. Chen X. Jiang D. Zhu Y. Kang G. He F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18748-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the CRD was purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose (Fig. 2). In addition to protein that was retained on the column in the presence of Ca2+ and released with EDTA, there was evidence that some of the protein was retarded on the affinity resin but leached off during the wash. This behavior, reflecting relatively weak binding, is characteristic of other C-type CRDs expressed in isolation (23Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using a fucose-Sepharose affinity column (Fig. 2), consistent with the previous demonstration that fucose binds to LSECtin with nearly the same affinity as mannose (9Liu W. Tang L. Zhang G. Wei H. Cui Y. Guo L. Gou Z. Chen X. Jiang D. Zhu Y. Kang G. He F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18748-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The need for an extended column with very high densities of monosaccharide ligands to retain LSECtin probably explains why binding to mannose-containing columns was not detected in some recent experiments (10Domínguez-Soto Á. Aragoneses-Fenoll L. Martín-Gayo E. Martinez-Prats L. Colmenares M. Naranjo-Gómez M. Borrás F.E. Muñoz P. Zubiaur M. Toribio M.L. Delgardo R. Corbi A.L.

Fractions of 2 ml were collected. C, the complex of biotin-tagged CRD with streptavidin was repurified by affinity chromatography on a 1-ml column. Elution fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. In all cases aliquots of 20 μl were run on 17.5% gels that were stained with Coomassie Blue. The expected molecular mass of the expressed CRD is 15,000 Da.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To enhance the affinity of the protein for binding studies, a multivalent form of the CRD was created by appending a biotinylation sequence at the C-terminal end of the CRD. Expression of the CRD in bacteria also expressing the birA gene, which encodes biotin ligase, results in efficient biotinylation of the single lysine residue in the C-terminal extension (20Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Complexes containing four CRDs can then be formed by allowing the tagged protein to interact with streptavidin. This approach has successfully been used to enhance the affinity of other C-type CRDs (34Powlesland A.S. Ward E.M. Sadhu S.K. Guo Y. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20440-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The biotinylated protein was purified in the same way as the untagged CRD. After incubation with streptavidin, the complex was efficiently repurified on a smaller affinity column because of the enhanced affinity resulting from tetramerization (Fig. 2). The biotinylated monomeric and tetrameric forms of the protein were used in subsequent studies of the interaction of LSECtin with target ligands. Previous studies have suggested that the extracellular domain of LSECtin assembles into forms that are larger than monomers, but a unique oligomeric structure has not been defined. The sequence of the neck region conforms very closely to the heptad repeat pattern of aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid side chains expected for an amphipathic α-helix that would be able to form coiled-coil structures (Fig. 1) (35Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). This domain also contains three cysteine residues, two of which are positioned at the hydrophobic positions that would be expected to face inwards in such a coiled coil. Although previous studies have suggested that the receptor does exist as disulfide-linked oligomers, these experiments were not performed on material selected for activity, and thus, the results may have been confounded by the presence of misfolded biosynthetic intermediates with heterogeneous disulfide-bond arrangements (9Liu W. Tang L. Zhang G. Wei H. Cui Y. Guo L. Gou Z. Chen X. Jiang D. Zhu Y. Kang G. He F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18748-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that the cysteine residues in the neck link polypeptides in the native receptor, the intact protein was expressed in rat fibroblasts, and functional receptor was purified by affinity chromatography. Based on the results with the monomeric and tetrameric forms of the CRDs, it was expected that an oligomeric receptor would bind efficiently to fucose-Sepharose, and blotting with an antibody to the CRD revealed that the protein is retained on the column and can be eluted with EDTA (Fig. 3). This active material was run on gels in the presence and absence of reducing agent, revealing that it exists as a disulfide-linked dimer. Thus, binding results obtained with the streptavidin-complexed CRD can be taken as an indication of the type of affinity enhancement that would be expected for the native oligomeric protein. Binding of LSECtin to Truncated Complex Glycans—The binding specificity of LSECtin was initially investigated using the glycan array developed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (36Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.-H. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Fluorescently labeled streptavidin-CRD complex was created by incubating the biotin-tagged CRD with streptavidin that was prelabeled with Alex-488. The purified complex was then used to probe the array at multiple concentrations (Fig. 4). At low concentrations highly selective binding to a limited set of glycans was obtained. The common feature of the glycans with the highest signals is the presence of one or more terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man sequences. However, some binding was also observed for a bi-antennary complex glycan in which both branches bear galactose residues linked β1-4 to the terminal GlcNAc residue and to a core trimannose structure. At higher concentrations of labeled probe, binding to an additional set of glycans with terminal α1-2-linked fucose residues was observed. There is some specificity to the interaction, because binding to glycans containing α1-3- and α1-4-linked fucose was not detected. Glycans with fucose linked α1-6 to the core are not present on the array. Although these results suggest that the receptor can bind to a second type of glycan, the binding occurs only at high concentrations of CRD presented in the form of a tetramer, indicating that the interaction would be weak. These results demonstrate the value of probing the glycan array at multiple concentrations of CRD and emphasize that preferential binding"

First, loss of 24,25EC decreased expression of the LXR target gene, ABCA1, substantiating its role as an endogenous ligand for LXR. Second, loss of 24,25EC increased acute cholesterol synthesis, which was rationalized by a concomitant increase in HMG-CoA reductase gene expression at the level of SREBP-2 processing. Therefore, in the absence of 24,25EC, fine-tuning of the acute regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is lost, supporting the hypothesis that 24,25EC functions to protect the cell against the accumulation of newly synthesized cholesterol.

This led to the formulation of the Oxysterol Hypothesis of Cholesterol Homeostasis, which over time has acquired both its champions and its detractors (1Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. Heiniger H.J.

However, oxysterols are the only regulatory molecules described so far to elicit effects on all major levels of cholesterol homeostasis.

The LXR target gene, the ATP binding cassette transporter, ABCA1, is the main facilitator of active transport of cholesterol from the cell to extracellular acceptors (22Schmitz G. Langmann T.

Most of these effects have been gleaned from studies in which 24,25EC was added to in vitro systems and/or cultured cells. The precise role(s) of endogenously produced 24,25EC remains to be elucidated. Synthesis of 24,25EC is dependent on the activity of the enzyme, 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) (17Dollis D. Schuber F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Boutaud O. Dolis D. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 373-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OSC is a monotopic integral membrane protein which possesses a dual substrate recognition function that enables it to convert the cholesterol precursor 2,3(S)-monooxidosqualene (MOS) to lanosterol or the 24,25EC precursor 2,3(S):22(S),23-dioxidosqualene (DOS) to 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol (31Bloch K. Science. 1965; 150: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 32Nelson J.A. Steckbeck S.R. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1067-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, lanosterol and 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol are efficiently converted into cholesterol and 24,25EC, respectively, as the end products of this pathway (33Panini S.R. Sexton R.C. Gupta A.K. Parish E.J. Chitrakorn S. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 1190-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that OSC preferentially cyclizes DOS over MOS (27Boutaud O. Dolis D. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One way that we (15Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Under normal conditions, cholesterol synthesis is favored (Fig. 1A). Under partial inhibition of OSC, the build up of MOS is converted to DOS by the enzyme squalene epoxidase, explaining how cholesterol precursors can be channeled into 24,25EC synthesis at the expense of cholesterol synthesis (Fig. 1B). However, this approach is not ideal because it artificially raises levels of 24,25EC and also decreases cholesterol synthesis, which may be a confounding factor. In addition, there is the usual concern of specificity of effect associated with the use of pharmacological inhibitors. Moreover, conventional gene silencing approaches would also be problematic since synthesis of 24,25EC and cholesterol require the same enzymes; thus, production of both sterols would be inhibited. In the present study we tested a novel way to selectively inhibit 24,25EC production. Overexpression of OSC should have the opposite effect of partial inhibition, i.e. the abundance of OSC should efficiently convert all MOS into lanosterol before any MOS can be converted into DOS and, hence, into 24,25EC (Fig. 1C). This approach is more selective than using a pharmacological agent and should not inhibit cholesterol synthesis. In the current study we have used this approach to determine the precise role of endogenous 24,25EC in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. We previously hypothesized that 24,25EC protects the cell from accumulation of newly synthesized cholesterol rather than exogenous cholesterol, since both sterols are synthesized in parallel under a variety of conditions (34Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Lipids Health Dis. 2007; 6: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we show that loss of endogenous 24,25EC removes the fine-tuning in the control of cholesterol synthesis, indicating an important role for this oxysterol in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.

Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared from new born calf serum (37Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-7 was generously provided by Drs. Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein (UT Southwestern, Dallas). Generation of Plasmid Construct—pCMV4-OSC-Myc was constructed by annealing full-length human OSC into pcDNA3.1-V5-His using the TOPO TA cloning kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The OSC gene was then excised by restriction endonuclease digestion with NotI and KpnI and ligated into pcDNA4-Myc-His. Generation of OSC-overexpressing Cell Lines—CHO-7 cells were transfected with pCMV4-OSC-Myc (1 μg) for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (4 μl/well in a 6-well plate), and stable transfectants were selected for zeocin (500 μg/ml) resistance by limiting dilution and screened for OSC-Myc expression by Western blotting. Cell Culture—All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. CHO-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1 mixture) containing 5% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient serum supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/100 μg/ml) and l-glutamine (2 mm). Empty vector and OSC-overexpressing cell lines were maintained as CHO-7 cells but always in the presence of 100 μg/ml zeocin. Treatments were conducted for 24 h in media containing 5% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient serum. All treatments were added to cells either in absolute ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide and compared with vehicle-only controls. No cell toxicity was observed for any treatment at the concentrations employed. Reverse Transcriptase PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Cells were harvested for total RNA using Tri Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of total RNA were measured by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop ND-100 Spectrophotometer, Biolab). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol for SuperScript III First Strand cDNA synthesis kit. Quantitative (real-time) reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed using SensiMix dT on a Corbett Rotorgene 3000 and analyzed using Rotor-Gene 6 Version 6.0 (Build 27) (Corbett Research). Primer pairs used for the amplification of various genes from cDNAs were described previously (19Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 47: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Primer pairs for human/hamster OSC were: forward, ACCTATGAGACCAAGCGTGG; reverse, TCCAGGCCAAACCAGGTG. PCR products were verified by sequencing. Melting curve analysis was performed to confirm production of a single product in each reaction. The change in gene expression levels was determined by normalizing mRNA levels of the gene of interest to the mRNA level of the housekeeping gene, porphobilinogen deaminase (19Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—To measure OSC-Myc protein expression, total cell lysates were prepared as previously described (5Adams C.M. Reitz J. De Brabander J.K. Feramisco J.D. Li L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 6-well plates or 60-mm dishes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1% SDS or 10% SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cell pellets were lysed by passing through a syringe needle (22 gauge, 25 times) and vortexed for 20 min at room temperature. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. Samples of equal protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% for SREBP-2, OSC-Myc, and β-actin). Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with blocking solution (5% w/v nonfat milk, 0.1% v/v Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline; 1 h). SREBP-2 was probed first using IgG-7D4, a mouse monoclonal antibody against hamster SREBP-2 (amino acids 32–250 (39Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); prepared from a mouse hybridoma cell line), ATCC CRL2198, followed by stripping and reprobing for β-actin and, last, OSC-Myc. Antibodies were incubated with the membranes (4 °C, overnight). After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified secondary antibodies (anti-mouse (IgG-7D4, Myc) or anti-rabbit (β-actin)). After further washing, bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence and exposed to film at room temperature for 2 s to 1 min. Cholesterol and 24(S),25-Epoxycholesterol Synthesis Assay—Cells were metabolically labeled with [1-14C]acetic acid for 24 h during treatments as previously described (15Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For the acute cholesterol synthesis assay, cells were pretreated with compactin for 24 h, washed, and labeled with [1-14C]acetic acid for 2 h. Cells were harvested and saponified, and the neutral lipid extracts were separated by thin-layer chromatography. Bands corresponding to cholesterol and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol were visualized by phosphorimaging (18-h exposure). Positive identification of the band corresponding to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol has previously been performed chemically and by mass spectrometry (see the supplemental data in Wong et al. (15Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)). Human ABCA1 Promoter Activity Assay—Promoter analysis was performed as previously described (19Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, reporter plasmids (250 ng/well) were transfected for 24 h into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (1 μl/well). The phRL-TK Renilla internal control plasmid (25 ng/well) was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. After treatment (24 h), cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Assay Reporter System according to the manufacturer's instructions in a Veritas luminometer (Turner Designs). Results were normalized to the renilla control and expressed as percent changes in luciferase activity relative to the wild-type ABCA1 vehicle-treated control condition. Cholesterol Mass Assay—Total cellular cholesterol mass was determined using an enzymatic fluorometric assay, employing the Amplex Red Cholesterol assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data Analysis and Statistics—All results shown are representative of at least two separate experiments. Data are presented either as mean ± half-range or means ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Where appropriate, statistical differences were determined by analysis of variance or Student t tests. A p value less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. Screening and Selection of Stable Cell Lines Over-expressing Human OSC—The enzyme OSC is key to the activity of the shunt pathway that produces 24,25EC. We cloned the human OSC cDNA into a mammalian expression vector containing a C-terminal c-Myc epitope tag and stably transfected it into CHO-7 cells. Stable cell lines with empty vector (EV) or varying levels of OSC expression were created and screened alongside the wild-type CHO-7 cells. In Fig. 2A, a conserved set of primers was employed that detected both the human and hamster gene, showing that overexpression of human OSC was as much as 20-fold above endogenous levels. In all three OSC overexpressing cell lines, protein expression (Fig. 2B) reflected gene expression (Fig. 2A). Synthesis of 24,25EC was then examined, and in line with our prediction, 24,25EC was substantially decreased with increased OSC expression (by >95% in OSC3 cells) (Fig. 2C). No change was observed in cholesterol synthesis or cellular cholesterol mass in all cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D). To confirm that overexpression of OSC specifically inhibited 24,25EC synthesis in the OSC-overexpressing cell lines, we treated the EV control cell line and the highest OSC-overexpressing cell line, OSC3, with a specific inhibitor of OSC, GW534511X. Similar to our previous observations in CHO cells (34Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Lipids Health Dis. 2007; 6: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), 0.1–1 nm GW534511X greatly enhanced 24,25EC synthesis in EV cells (Fig. 2E), in line with the scheme depicted in Fig. 1B. In OSC3 cells, a 100-fold higher concentration of inhibitor was required to force the synthesis of 24,25EC, reflecting the higher relative expression of OSC in these cells (Fig. 2A). This result clearly demonstrates that the reduced ability of OSC-overexpressing cells to synthesize 24,25EC was a direct consequence of their overexpression of OSC. The cell lines with the highest expression of OSC, OSC2 and particularly OSC3, together with the empty vector control cell line, EV, were selected for use in subsequent experiments. ABCA1 Gene Expression Is Decreased in Cells Lacking the LXR Ligand 24,25EC—24,25EC is one of the most potent oxysterol ligands for LXR (15Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), which regulates expression of a number of genes involved in cholesterol efflux, including ABCA1. When OSC is overexpressed, the decrease in 24,25EC synthesis led to a corresponding decrease in ABCA1 gene expression (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with our previous findings in human macrophages where statin treatment was reported to down-regulate ABCA1 expression by inhibiting the production of 24,25EC (15Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When EV cells were treated with the archetypal statin, compactin, ABCA1 gene expression was greatly reduced to levels observed in OSC3 cells (Fig. 3B), consistent with inhibited synthesis of an LXR ligand produced in the mevalonate pathway. When ABCA1 gene expression was examined over time after compactin pretreatment, we observed that ABCA1 mRNA levels increased in the EV control cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, ABCA1 mRNA expression remained unchanged in OSC3 cells over the first 8 h but increased by 24 h. This suggests that other sterol ligands are insufficient to initially compensate for the lack of 24,25EC with respect to ABCA1 expression. Indeed, when increasing concentrations of 24,25EC were added to EV, OSC2, and OSC3 cell lines, ABCA1 gene expression was restored to control levels at 0.1 μm in the two cell lines lacking 24,25EC (Fig. 3D). All three cell lines responded similarly to higher concentrations of 24,25EC. To confirm that this effect was mediated transcriptionally at the level of LXR activation, ABCA1 promoter activity was then analyzed by transfecting cells with a luciferase reporter construct driven by a ∼1 kilobase fragment of the human ABCA1 promoter (from –928 to +101 bp) (40Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). OSC3 cells and compactin-treated EV cells both displayed reduced activity of the ABCA1 promoter to levels comparable to those seen when the DR4 motif (where LXR binds) was mutated (Fig. 3E). The decreased ABCA1 promoter activity of OSC3 cells was restored by the addition of 0.1 μm 24,25EC, an effect that was not apparent with the DR4-mutated construct. Taken together, these data indicate that the decrease in ABCA1 expression in OSC3 cells is principally due to the loss of 24,25EC and confirms the importance of this endogenously produced LXR ligand in LXR target gene expression, notably ABCA1. Inhibition of 24,25EC Synthesis Leads to an Increase in Acute Cholesterol Synthesis—We have proposed that 24,25EC functions as a feedback regulator to protect all cholesterogenic cells against the accumulation of newly synthesized cholesterol (34Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Lipids Health Dis. 2007; 6: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because little difference was observed between the relative synthesis of cholesterol in EV and OSC3 cells over an ex"
https://openalex.org/W2006268163,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and acquire cellular antigens and danger signals from dying cells to initiate antitumor immune responses via direct cell-to-cell interaction and cytokine production. The optimal forms of tumor cell death for priming DCs for the release of danger signals are not fully understood. OBP-301 (Telomelysin) is a telomerase-specific replication-competent adenovirus that induces selective E1 expression and exclusively kills human cancer cells. Here, we show that OBP-301 replication produced the endogenous danger signaling molecule, uric acid, in infected human tumor cells, which in turn stimulated DCs to produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin 12 (IL-12). Subsequently, IFN-γ release upregulated the endogenous expression of the proteasome activator PA28 in tumor cells and resulted in the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Our data suggest that virus-mediated oncolysis might be the effective stimulus for immature DCs to induce specific activity against human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042766564,"Platelet activation is a critical process during inflammation, thrombosis, and cancer. Here, we show that galectin-1, an endogenous lectin with immunoregulatory properties, plays a key role in human platelet activation and function. Galectin-1 binds to human platelets in a carbohydrate-dependent manner and synergizes with ADP or thrombin to induce platelet aggregation and ATP release. Furthermore, galectin-1 induces F-actin polymerization, up-regulation of P-selectin, and GPIIIa expression; promotes shedding of microvesicles; and triggers conformational changes in GPIIb/IIIa. In addition, exposure to this lectin favors the generation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates. A further mechanistic analysis revealed the involvement of Ca(2+) and cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways in galectin-1-mediated control of platelet activation. Finally, expression of endogenous galectin-1 in human platelets contributes to ADP-induced aggregation. Our study reveals a novel unrecognized role for galectin-1 in the control of platelet physiology with potential implications in thrombosis, inflammation, and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2040655372,"Arc/Arg3.1 is an immediate early gene whose expression is necessary for the late-phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory consolidation. Whereas pathways regulating Arc transcription have been extensively investigated, less is known about the role of post-transcriptional mechanisms in Arc expression. Fluorescence microscopy experiments in cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that Arc protein level was dramatically increased by activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway, which is implicated in long-term memory. A PKA-dependent increase in Arc protein level was observed after pharmacological or synaptic activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which play a critical role in both LTP induction and learning. Arc protein was also up-regulated by activation of PKA through Gs-coupled dopamine and β-adrenergic receptors, which regulate the late-phase of LTP and memory. When agonists for the NMDA and Gs-coupled receptors were co-applied, they had an additive effect on Arc protein expression. Interestingly, Gs-coupled receptor stimulation was ineffective in the presence of an NMDA receptor antagonist, suggesting calcium influx through the NMDA receptor plays a gating role in this pathway. Stimulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway did not affect Arc mRNA level or protein stability, identifying translational efficacy as the main determinant of Arc protein expression level. It is concluded that efficient Arc translation requires NMDA receptor activity, whereas a further enhancement can be achieved with activation of Gs-coupled receptors. These experiments have, therefore, revealed remarkable similarities in the signaling pathways that control Arc expression and those that regulate LTP, learning, and memory.

It is concluded that efficient Arc translation requires NMDA receptor activity, whereas a further enhancement can be achieved with activation of Gs-coupled receptors. These experiments have, therefore, revealed remarkable similarities in the signaling pathways that control Arc expression and those that regulate LTP, learning, and memory. Activity-regulated, cytoskeletal-associated protein Arc, also known as Arg3.1, was identified as an immediate early gene, whose mRNA is induced by patterns of synaptic activity that elicit LTP (1Link W.

After transcription Arc mRNA is transported into neuronal dendrites, where it localizes specifically to activated synapses (3Steward O. Wallace C.S. Lyford G.L. Worley P.F.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and reelin-integrin receptor signaling increase Arc protein synthesis in synaptoneurosome preparations (22Yin Y. Edelman G.M. Vanderklish P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, β-adrenergic receptor activation increases Arc protein expression and enhances memory without an increase in the fluorescence in situ hybridization signal of Arc mRNA (15McIntyre C.K. Miyashita T. Setlow B. Marjon K.D. Steward O. Guzowski J.F. McGaugh J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10718-10723Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Arc protein expression can be regulated post-transcriptionally. The level at which this may occur is unknown and could include regulation of mRNA stability, translational efficacy, protein degradation, or a combination of the above. To further study the post-transcriptional regulation of Arc protein expression, both Arc mRNA and protein levels were determined in cultured hippocampal neurons using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence microscopy. Stimulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by either NMDA receptor or Gs-coupled receptor activation resulted in a strong up-regulation of Arc protein. Activation of the NMDA receptor results in calcium influx, which can activate PKA through calcium-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM)-dependent adenylyl cyclases (ACs) type I and VIII, whereas D1/D5 dopamine and β-adrenergic receptor receptors activate ACs through the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gs. The effects of activating NMDA and Gs-coupled receptors on Arc protein levels were additive, whereas NMDA receptor function was required for the dopamine and β-adrenergic effects. The PKA-induced increase in Arc protein level occurred without a change in Arc mRNA level or Arc protein stability but was prevented by a translation inhibitor. Together, these results show that NMDA and Gs-coupled receptor signaling pathways converge to regulate Arc translation. Cell Culture—Hippocampal rat brain tissue (E18) obtained from Brainbits, Inc. (Springfield, IL) was cultured as previously described (24Van de Ven T.J. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9488-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were dissociated and plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 on poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) in a chemically defined medium of B27, glutamate, and glycine in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). Neurons were fed once weekly by replacing half the medium. For the Western blot and qRT-PCR experiments neurons were cultured at the same density in 6-well tissue culture plates from BD Biosciences Falcon. DNA Constructs—The Arc coding region with flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) was amplified by a PCR reaction using CHORI-230 rat BAC Clone DNA as a template (Children's Hospital Oakland-BACPAK Resources, Oakland, Ca) and was subcloned into the pGemT-easy vector (Promega, Madison WI). The region of the gene containing two introns was replaced with DNA amplified by PCR from Marathon rat brain cDNA (Clontech, Cambridge, UK) via restriction digest and ligation. A novel BsrGI restriction site was added directly before the stop codon in the Arc coding region by PCR using the Arc pGemT-easy construct without introns as template. EYFP from the Clontech vector EYFP-N1 was amplified by PCR using primers to incorporate BsrGI sites flanking the coding region. BsrGI-EYFP-BsrGI was subcloned into the Arc-pGemT-easy vector, and the Arc-EYFP DNA was subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The Arc coding region construct was generated from DNA amplified by PCR from Marathon rat brain cDNA (Clontech) and subcloned into the pGemT-easy vector (Promega). The Arc coding region was then subcloned into EYFP-N1 (Clontech). Plasmids expressing cyan and red Fluorescent proteins (ECFP-C1 and dsRed2-C1, Clontech) were used as controls. The DNA sequence of the coding region of the monomeric form of EosFP was codon-optimized using Oligo Version 4.0 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, Co) and was synthesized and subcloned into pBluescript-SK by Epoch Biolabs (Sugarland, TX). EYFP was replaced by EosFP in the Arc-EYFPN1 plasmid by restriction digest and ligation. The sequence of the full-length Arc cDNA used in these experiments is identical to the NCBI rat Arc mRNA sequence with GenBank™ accession number NM_019361. In the Arc plasmid containing the coding region only, the Arc 5′-UTR has been replaced with the short optimal Kozak consensus sequence GCCACC, whereas the 3′-UTR was removed. Transfections and Stimulation—Neuronal cultures were transfected between day 17 and 25 as previously described (24Van de Ven T.J. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9488-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For each transfection, 2 μg of DNA (1 μg of each plasmid) was added to 50 μl of Neurobasal medium, and 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was added to a separate 50 μl of Neurobasal medium. After a 5-min room temperature (RT) incubation, the samples were combined and allowed to incubate for an additional 20 min at RT. Culture media was removed from the neurons, and the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 solution was added dropwise to the cultures. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced, and the dishes were returned to the incubator for 16 h. When stated, hippocampal neurons were stimulated with 50 μm forskolin, 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP, 10 μm NMDA, 100 μm SKF-38393, 10 μm isoproterenol, 20 μm H89, 20 μm anisomycin, 10 μm MK-801, 10 μm APV, 10 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic-monophosphate (8-CPT), all from Sigma-Aldrich, or 10 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem) in the defined media. For the APV withdrawal experiments, neurons were cultured with conditioned media containing APV starting on day 5 in culture (day 5). Neurons were transfected on D23, and APV free media was added on D24. Immunofluorescence and Imaging—For immunofluorescence experiments we used the monoclonal C-7 Arc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). C-7 is highly specific for Arc (Fig. 1A) and has been used previously for immunofluorescence (25Chowdhury S. Shepherd J.D. Okuno H. Lyford G. Petralia R.S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R. Worley P.F.

Transfected neuron dishes were rinsed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with glucose and pyruvate (PBS) and fixed with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, and 1× PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and imaged in PBS. Cells used for immunofluorescence were fixed with paraformaldehyde as above and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 20 min at -20 °C. After permeabilization, the cells were blocked with a solution containing 10% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 1× PBS for 1 h at RT. Primary C-7 antibody diluted 1:100 in block was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The dishes were washed 3 times with block for 10 min each and incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in block solution for 1-2 h at RT. The dishes were washed as above with block then once with PBS for 10 min and imaged in PBS. Neurons were imaged as previously described (24Van de Ven T.J. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9488-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were imaged with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Diaphot inverted fluorescence microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective. A Hamamatsu (Shizuka, Japan) cooled digital camera and Open-lab Version 3.1.6 software (Improvision, Lexington, MA) were used to acquire the images. For the EosFP experiments neurons were treated with UV light for 30 s using a blue filter (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) before imaging. Western Blot Analysis—Neuronal cultures were dissolved in lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer; 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)), scraped into 1.5 ml tubes, and sonicated (24Van de Ven T.J. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9488-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To assure equal protein loading, the concentrations of the lysates were determined with the DC Protein Assay kit according to the microplate protocol (Bio-Rad). Samples consisting of 25 μg of lysate protein were separated using SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted as follows. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h at RT. The blots were incubated with the Arc antibody diluted 1:100 in the blocking solution overnight at 4 °C and then were washed 3 times for 10 min each with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) at RT. The membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase in block (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at RT. The membranes were then washed 8 times for 15 min each with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, exposed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase) substrate (Pierce), and developed on x-ray film according to the instructions. qRT-PCR—Neurons in 6-well tissue culture plates were transfected with 1 μg each of Arc-EYFP and dsRed2C1 plasmids (Clontech). 16 h post-transfection cells were treated with 50 μm forskolin or vehicle for 4 h. RNA was isolated with the Qiashredder kit according to instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was harvested from a 6-well plate via a Qiagen column, subjected to a DNase treatment, and re-purified with a second Qiagen column. 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with the Bio-Rad I-script kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was generated by serial dilution of all the cDNAs. Reactions were set up in 96-well PCR plates (USA Scientific, Inc. Ocala, CA) with iQ SYBR Green Supermix according to the instructions (Bio-Rad) and run in the iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Data Analysis—Grayscale images (12-bit resolution) of fluorescent neurons were acquired separately for the cyan (ECFP) and yellow (EYFP) channels and analyzed using ImagePro Plus Version 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Outlines of fluorescent neurons in the images were detected by the ImagePro “automatic bright objects” tool, and both the area (A) and total fluorescence intensity (F) within the outline were measured. For each neuron, the average fluorescence (F/A) was divided by the exposure time (T) used to acquire the image to obtain fluorescence/pixel/s (FPS = F/A/T), which was used as a relative measure of protein expression. FPS was measured for n neurons (n = at least 20 per condition) to allow calculation of a mean and S.E. for each condition. Cyan (control) and yellow (Arc) FPS values were obtained for each neuron, and their ratio was calculated. FPS was calculated for the red EosFP signals in a similar manner. qRT-PCR results were analyzed with iCycler iQ optical system software Version 3.0a (Bio-Rad). Post-transcriptional regulation of Arc expression was investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons. First, treatments were identified that have been reported to induce endogenous Arc expression. Previous work has shown that Arc mRNA level is increased after treatment with NMDA, dopamine receptor agonist, or forskolin (13Fosnaugh J.S. Bhat R.V. Yamagata K. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2377-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Steward O. Worley P.F.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5484-5493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin directly activates ACs, resulting in cAMP production and activation of both PKA and the exchange protein directly activated by cyclic-AMP (Epac). Activation of NMDA and dopamine receptors can also result in AC activation and cAMP production, mediated by Ca2+-CaM and the stimulatory G-protein Gs, respectively. Therefore, the effect of these agonists on Arc protein level was investigated in hippocampal neurons. Because forskolin can have nonspecific effects independent of its action on ACs, neurons were also stimulated with 8-Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP. Endogenous Arc Protein Expression—The effect of the agonists on Arc protein level was first evaluated by Western analysis using a monoclonal Arc-specific antibody. Fig. 1A illustrates that this antibody recognizes Arc protein, seen as a single band at ∼50 kDa. Arc protein levels increased after a 4-h treatment with each of the following agonists: forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, NMDA, and the D1/D5 dopamine receptor agonist SKF-38393. Pharmacological activation of PKA by either forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP resulted in a stronger induction of Arc than activation of NMDA receptors or dopamine receptors. Western analysis reflects a combined effect of the compounds on Arc protein expression for all cell types present in the hippocampal culture, including neurons and glial cells, both of which express Arc protein (27Rodriguez J.J. Davies H.A. Silva A.T. De S.I. Peddie C.J. Colyer F.M. Lancashire C.L. Fine A. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Stewart M.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 2384-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine Arc expression solely in neurons, hippocampal cultures were treated with agonists, fixed, and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using the Arc antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Only neurons were selected for data analysis. Arc protein displayed a punctate distribution and was found primarily in the soma, with lower levels in the distal dendrites (Fig. 1B). A time course of Arc expression was determined by stimulating cultured neurons with forskolin for different time periods over a 24-h period. Arc expression detected with the Arc antibody peaked at 4 h, reaching a 12-fold increase over unstimulated neurons (Fig. 1C). How Arc expression level was affected by the previously used agonists was also tested (Fig. 1D). Arc protein level increased ∼12-fold for forskolin, 11-fold for 8-Br-cAMP, 7-fold for NMDA, and 4-fold with SKF-38393. NMDA and dopamine signaling are both expected to activate PKA through Ca2+/CaM and Gs, respectively. Therefore, the co-application of NMDA and SKF-38393 was investigated. This resulted in an 11-fold increase in Arc protein expression (Fig. 1D), indicating the effects of NMDA and the dopamine agonist are additive. The ability of the agonists to induce Arc in the presence of the PKA antagonist H89 was also investigated (Fig. 1D). Pretreatment with H89 abolished the effect for all the agonists tested, indicating that in each case the induction of Arc protein expression depended on PKA activation. The effects of the agonists on endogenous Arc protein level may have resulted from transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation. This issue was investigated next. Post-transcriptional Regulation of Arc Protein Expression—To determine whether PKA activation could result in a post-transcriptional effect on Arc protein level, a yellow fluorescent Arc fusion protein (Arc-EYFP) was expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons through transient transfections (Fig. 2). As a control, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) was co-transfected with Arc-EYFP, resulting in co-expression of both cDNAs in the same subset of neurons. In these experiments, a full-length Arc cDNA construct was used that contained complete 5′- and 3′-UTRs, whereas transcription was driven by the strong viral CMV promoter. Because of its high constitutive activity, the CMV promoter should be relatively insensitive to regulation by cellular signaling pathways, allowing us to evaluate post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate Arc expression. Similar to what was seen for endogenous protein, exogenous Arc protein was found primarily in the soma, with lower levels in the dendrites (Fig. 2A). Forskolin treatment caused Arc to be sharply up-regulated (notice the difference in exposure times), whereas its distribution became more punctate both in the soma and dendrites (Fig. 2A). Expression of both Arc-EYFP and ECFP is driven by the same viral CMV promoter; therefore, they are expected to be subject to the same transcriptional regulation, and a difference in fluorescence signal should reflect post-transcriptional events. To correct for differences in general protein expression between neurons, the Arc-EYFP signal was normalized to ECFP in the same neuron. This normalization also corrects for any effect that an agonist has on general translation within a single cell. Again, the time course of the forskolin effect on Arc protein expression was determined. Arc-EYFP- and ECFP-transfected cultures were stimulated with forskolin for different time periods over 24 h. Arc expression peaked at 4 h with a 9.4-fold increase over unstimulated neurons (Fig. 2B). Next, the effect of the agonists on Arc expression level was tested. All agonists increased Arc-EYFP expression, while having a marginal effect on ECFP. Agonist treatment did not have a negative effect on neuronal health (supplemental Fig. 1). Arc-EYFP/ECFP ratios increased 9.1-fold for forskolin, 10.4-fold for 8-Br-cAMP, 4.4-fold for NMDA, and 3.6-fold with SKF-38393 stimulation (Fig. 2C). NMDA and SKF-38393 co-application increased Arc expression additively by 8.8-fold. In addition, H89 blocked all of the agonist effects (Fig. 2D). In these experiments transcription of Arc-EYFP and ECFP was driven by the constitutively active strong CMV promoter in order to minimize transcriptional effects of the treatments. Effects of the pharmacological treatments on general transcription were corrected for by normalizing for ECFP expression. The results obtained with the ECFP construct show that the CMV promoter is almost completely insensitive to the various agonist treatments. Consequently, the strong increase in Arc-EYFP levels likely resulted from a post-transcriptional mechanism. Regulation of Arc Protein Expression Does Not Require the Arc-untranslated Regions—Several post-transcriptional mechanisms control protein levels through an interaction with the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of a target mRNA. Therefore, it was investigated whether the agonist-induced increases in Arc protein levels reported above require the presence of UTRs in the Arc mRNA. Experiments were performed with an Arc construct that lacked both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs. The 3′-UTR of Arc has previously been shown to be important in dendritic targeting, although its role in Arc protein translation is unknown (28Kobayashi H. Yamamoto S. Maruo T. Murakami F. Eur.J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding Arc-EYFP without the UTRs was co-expressed with ECFP in cultured neurons (Fig. 3). Again, forskolin treatment caused Arc to be up-regulated (notice the difference in exposure times), whereas its distribution became more punctuate in the soma and dendrites (Fig. 3A). Transfected cultures were stimulated with forskolin for different time periods over 24 h. Arc expression ratios peaked at 4 h, with a 7.6-fold increase over unstimulated neurons (Fig. 3B). Transfected cultures were also stimulated with the PKA agonists (Fig. 3C). All the previously used agonists increased Arc-EYFP expression, while having a marginal effect on ECFP. Arc expression ratios increased ∼8-fold for forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP, 4-fold for NMDA, 3.2-fold for SKF-38393, and additively 7.6-fold for NMDA plus SKF-38393 stimulation. NMDA stimulation did not enhance the forskolin effect, possibly because forskolin has already saturated the signaling pathway. Again, the PKA antagonist H89 blocked the effect of all agonists tested (Fig. 3D). The two main effectors of cAMP are PKA and Epac, an activator of the small G-protein Rap1. To investigate a possible involvement of Epac in the regulation of Arc expression, we used 8-CPT, a cAMP analogue that specifically activates Epac. 8-CPT was completely ineffective, further verifying that cAMP"
https://openalex.org/W2055544990,"In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), mutation/deletion of TP53 is strongly associated with early disease progression, resistance to chemotherapy and short patient survival. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop novel treatment protocols for this high-risk patient group. The present study was performed to evaluate Hsp90 inhibition as a possible therapeutic approach for such patients. Primary CLL cells of defined ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/p53 status were incubated with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) and analysed by western blotting for the expression of p53, p21, MDM2 and Akt. GA downregulated overexpressed mutant p53 protein (an oncogene) and upregulated wild-type (wt) p53 (a tumour suppressor). The upregulation of wt p53 by GA was independent of ATM and was accompanied by downregulation of Akt and the active form of MDM2, indicating a possible mechanism. GA also produced a p53/ATM-independent increase in the levels of p21—a potent inducer of cell-cycle arrest. In-vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that GA killed cultured CLL cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion irrespective of their p53/ATM status and more effectively than normal blood mononuclear cells. In summary, our findings reveal important consequences of inhibiting Hsp90 in CLL cells and strongly support the therapeutic evaluation of Hsp90 inhibitors in poor-prognosis patients with p53 defects."
https://openalex.org/W2061100459,"The acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated, voltage-insensitive cation channels expressed throughout the nervous system. ASIC1a plays a role in learning, pain, and fear-related behaviors. In addition, activation of ASIC1a during prolonged acidosis following cerebral ischemia induces neuronal death. ASICs undergo steady-state desensitization, a characteristic that limits ASIC1a activity and may play a prominent role in the prevention of ASIC1a-evoked neuronal death. In this study, we found exogenous and endogenous arginine-phenylalanine-amide (RF-amide)-related peptides decreased the pH sensitivity of ASIC1a steady-state desensitization. During conditions that normally induced steady-state desensitization, these peptides profoundly enhanced ASIC1a activity. We also determined that human ASIC1a required more acidic pH to undergo steady-state desensitization compared with mouse ASIC1a. Surprisingly, steady-state desensitization of human ASIC1a was also affected by a greater number of peptides compared with mouse ASIC1a. Mutation of five amino acids in a region of the extracellular domain changed the characteristics of human ASIC1a to those of mouse ASIC1a, suggesting that this region plays a pivotal role in neuropeptide and pH sensitivity of steady-state desensitization. Overall, these experiments lend vital insight into steady-state desensitization of ASIC1a and expand our understanding of the structural determinants of RF-amide-related peptide modulation. Furthermore, our finding that endogenous peptides shift steady-state desensitization suggests that RF-amides could impact the role of ASIC1a in both pain and neuronal damage following stroke and ischemia.

In mice, pharmacologically preventing ASIC1a activation or disrupting the Asic1 gene drastically reduces neuronal death caused by cerebral ischemia (4Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J.

In particular, PcTx1-containing venom from the West Indies tarantula, Plasmopeus cambridgie prevents ASIC1a activation by promoting steady-state desensitization (20Chen X. Kalbacher H. Grunder S. J.

Mild increases in proton concentration (approximate pH 7.2–6.9) cause ASIC1a channels to undergo steady-state desensitization and become unavailable for subsequent activation when the pH lowers to values that are normally sufficient to induce activation (pH < 6.8) (22Babini E. Paukert M. Geisler H.S. Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41597-41603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PcTx1 increases the pH sensitivity of steady-state desensitization and causes ASIC1a channels to desensitize at pH 7.4 (20Chen X. Kalbacher H. Grunder S. J. Gen.

Because desensitized channels fail to activate when the pH acidifies, PcTx1 limits ASIC1a activity.

RF-amides represent a small family of neuropeptides that contain a C-terminal “arginine-phenylalanine-amide” consensus. RF-amides have a variety of functions, most of which are mediated through G protein-coupled receptors (33Panula P. Kalso E. Nieminen M. Kontinen V.K. Brandt A. Pertovaara A. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Fukusumi S. Fujii R. Hinuma S. Peptides (N.

Y.). 2006; 27: 1110-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, some effects of RF-amides are thought to be due to direct action on amiloride-sensitive ASIC-like channels (37Huang B.S. Leenen F.H. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Nishimura M. Ohtsuka K. Takahashi H. Yoshimura M.

Babinski K. Seguela P. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of specific RF-amides, ASICs conduct current longer than in the absence of peptide. In the peripheral nervous system, this interaction is thought to accentuate pain perception (39Lingueglia E. Deval E. Lazdunski M. Peptides (N. Y.). 2006; 27: 1138-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the connection between RF-amide-related peptides and ASIC1a activity in the central nervous system is not well understood. Most studies of ASIC1a and its functional roles in vivo have focused on rodent ASIC1a. Yet mouse and human ASIC1a have amino acid differences within the large extracellular region of the channel, which controls pH sensitivity and desensitization (22Babini E. Paukert M. Geisler H.S.

Physiol. 2007; 129: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these amino acid differences affect the biophysical characteristics of human and mouse ASIC1a. We determined that there are species-specific differences in the pH dependence and neuropeptide sensitivity of ASIC1a between mouse and human. Furthermore, we determined that not only desensitization following activation but also steady-state desensitization are modulated by exogenous and endogenous RF-amide peptides. Human ASIC1a was affected by a greater complement of endogenous peptides compared with mouse. These results suggest that the biophysical characteristics of human and mouse ASIC1a, although similar, are not identical and that modulation of human ASIC1a activity in vivo may be more complex than in rodents. Recombinant DNA Construction and Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Human and mouse nucleotide sequence corresponding to GenBank™ accession numbers NM_001095 and NM_009597, respectively, were cloned into the pMT3 mammalian expression plasmid as described previously (24Askwith C.C. Cheng C. Ikuma M. Benson C. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into the human ASIC1a-pMT3 expression plasmid using the Stratagene QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Cedar Creek, TX). Mutagenic primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). All ASIC cDNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Plant-Microbe Genomic Facility at the Ohio State University. Qiagen Midi or Maxi prep kits (Valencia, CA) were used to prepare plasmid DNA for oocyte injection. Unfertilized oocytes were harvested from female Xenopus laevis purchased from Xenopus I (Dexter, MI), using standard procedures (44Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, frogs were anesthetized with tricaine methane sulfonate; ovarian lobes were surgically isolated, and the follicle membranes were removed from the oocytes by treatment with 1.2 mg/ml of collagenase in Modified Barth's solution lacking calcium (2.4 mm NaHCO3, 88 mm NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, 1 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 125 units/liter penicillin/streptomycin) for 2–3 h at room temperature (44Adams C.M.

Healthy stage IV and V oocytes were sorted and stored in Modified Barth's solution plus calcium (0.4 mm CaCl2 and 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2). One to 3 h after isolation, oocyte nuclei were injected with pMT3-ASIC1a expression plasmids at 100 ng/μl concentration using a PV820 pneumatic picopump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota FL). Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for 18–72 h before experiments were performed. Electrophysiological Experiments—Whole-cell macroscopic current was measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique at a holding potential of –60 mV (24Askwith C.C. Cheng C. Ikuma M. Benson C. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Electrodes were pulled (0.5–2 megohms) using a Sutter P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and filled with 3 m KCl. Data were acquired using an Oocyte Clamp OC-725 Amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), an AXON Digidata 1200 digitizer, and pCLAMP-8 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All experiments were done using frog Ringer's solution (116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm MES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) with a pH adjusted to the indicated levels using 1 n NaOH. Oocyte recordings were done in a modified RC-Z3 250-μl oocyte recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The solution exchange rate in the recording chamber was ∼1 ml/s. FMRF-amide was purchased from Bachem Biosciences Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). FRRF-amide, NPFF (SQAFLFQPQRF-amide), and human QRFP, also known as P518 and 26RFa (TSGPLGNLAEELNGYSRKKGGFSFRF-amide), were synthesized by EZBiolab, Inc. (Westfield, IN). PcTx1-containing venom from P. cambridgie was purchased from SpiderPharm (Yarnell, AZ). Peptides and venom at the indicated concentrations did not change the pH of the extracellular solutions. Neither acid, peptide, nor venom at the indicated concentrations induced current in oocytes not injected with ASIC1a. pH Dose Response—Basal pH was maintained at pH 7.4, and maximal current was established by applying 1 ml of saturating pH solution (pH 5.0) to the oocytes. During experiments, 1 ml of acidic test pH solution was applied to the oocyte, and protongated current was allowed to decay fully. Oocytes were then washed with 5 ml of pH 7.4 solution and allowed to recover for 2 min between pH applications. This amount of time, determined experimentally, allowed full recovery from desensitization of both mouse and human ASIC1a. Experimental test pH applications were flanked by saturating pH applications (pH 5.0) to minimize the impact of potential tachyphylaxis of proton-gated current. Peptides were applied at the designated concentrations in pH 7.4 solution 2 min before application of the activating pH solutions. For quantification, peak current amplitude was determined for each test pH and normalized to the average of the flanking pH 5.0 current amplitudes. Steady-state Desensitization—Oocytes were maintained in a basal pH solution of 7.9 during experiments to ensure that no steady-state desensitization was occurring prior to pH 5.0 activation (20Chen X. Kalbacher H. Grunder S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 45Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To induce steady-state desensitization, 1 ml of “conditioning” test pH was applied to the cells for 2 min followed by application of pH 5.0. Cells were then washed with 5 ml of pH 7.9 solution and allowed to recover for 2 min before the next conditioning and activating (pH 5.0) acid application. Maximal current was determined by application of pH 5.0 from a conditioning pH of 7.9 before and after all test conditioning pH recordings to account for any tachyphylaxis of proton-gated current. Peptides were applied in pH 7.9 solution for 2 min, and then in conditioning pH solutions for another 2 min prior to pH 5.0 application. To analyze the concentration-dependent effects of RF-amide-related peptides, steady-state desensitization was studied at a single conditioning pH (6.8 for human ASIC1a, 7.0 for mouse ASIC1a), and the peptide concentration was varied. For experiments using PcTx1-containing venom, cells were maintained in basal pH 7.4. Venom was applied to cells in the conditioning pH at a 1:10,000 dilution for 4 min before and during activation. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using the Axon Clampfit 9.0 software. To measure the rate of channel desensitization, the decay phase of current was fitted to a single exponential equation, I = k0 + k1 × e–t/τd, and the τ of desensitization (τd) was calculated. Two-tailed Student's t tests were done with paired or unpaired data (as indicated in the figure legends). A “p” value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The pH0.5 was calculated by fitting the data from individual oocytes using the equation I/IpH(max) = 1/{1 + (EC50/[H+])n} = 1/{1 + 10 n(pH – pH 0.5)}, where n is the Hill coefficient, and EC50 and pH0.5 are the proton concentration and pH yielding half of the saturating peak current amplitude (IpH(max)). The pHmax was determined by application of pH 5.0 following pH 7.4 (pH dose response of activation) or conditioning pH 7.9 (steady-state desensitization). The EC50 for each peptide was calculated by fitting the data from individual oocytes using the equation I/Imax = 1/{1 + (EC50/[peptide])n}, where n is the Hill coefficient; EC50 is the peptide concentration inducing half of the saturating peptide effect (Imax). Differential Sensitivity of Mouse and Human ASIC1a to Protons—Human or mouse ASIC1a was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and two-electrode voltage clamp was used to compare the biophysical properties of whole-cell proton-gated currents. In oocytes expressing ASIC1a from either species, reducing the extracellular basal pH from 7.4 to 5.0 induced large inward currents (Fig. 1A) that desensitized similarly (τd) = 3.01 s for human ASIC1a and 3.27 s for mouse ASIC1a, n = 7–13, p = 0.64). However, application of sub-maximal acidic pH solutions to oocytes expressing either mouse or human ASIC1a revealed that the pH sensitivity of activation was subtly different between species (Fig. 1A). Although application of pH 6.7 solution to human ASIC1a induced only small currents (5.4 ± 1.3% of pH 5.0, n = 10), application of pH 6.7 solution induced a robust response in mouse ASIC1a (41.6 ± 5.8% of pH 5.0, n = 10; p = 9.7 × 10–6 compared with human ASIC1a) (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, pH 6.0 solutions produced maximal currents in human ASIC1a (101.5 ± 5.4% of pH 5.0, n = 7) but not in mouse ASIC1a (79.8 ± 4.1% of pH 5.0, n = 9; p = 0.006 compared with human ASIC1a) (Fig. 1A). To determine the extent of the difference in pH-dependent activation between mouse and human ASIC1a, a detailed pH dose response was performed. Mouse ASIC1a was activated by smaller acidic shifts in pH than human ASIC1a but required more acidic pH values to plateau (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the activation curves of mouse and human ASIC1a intersected near the pH of half-maximal activation (pH0.5), which was not statistically different (pH0.5 of human ASIC1a = 6.46 ± 0.04, n = 10, and pH0.5 of mouse ASIC1a = 6.57 ± 0.05, n = 6; p = 0.13). The Hill coefficient for proton-induced activation of mouse ASIC1a was smaller than human ASIC1a, although the data were not statistically significant (Hill coefficient of human ASIC1a = 5.9 ± 1.0, n = 10, and mouse ASIC1a = 3.4 ± 1.0, n = 6; p = 0.11). The fact that the pH dose-response curve was different between mouse and human ASIC1a suggested that pH sensitivity of other channel properties might also be different. To analyze the pH dependence of steady-state desensitization, we conditioned oocytes for 2 min with extracellular solutions ranging from pH 7.9 to 6.6 (the conditioning pH) and then activated proton-gated currents with the saturating pH of 5.0 (Fig. 1C) (22Babini E. Paukert M. Geisler H.S. Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41597-41603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Following the application of a conditioning pH of 7.0, the peak current amplitude of human ASIC1a pH 5.0-evoked currents was 78.9 ± 11.5% of maximal (n = 13). However, pH 7.0 conditioning of mouse ASIC1a resulted in a dramatic current reduction to 9.9 ± 2.2% of maximal current (n = 27; p = 7.2 × 10–10 compared with human ASIC1a). Quantification revealed that the pH sensitivity of steady-state desensitization was significantly different between mouse and human ASIC1a (Fig. 1D). The threshold for induction of steady-state desensitization was close to the normal physiological pH of 7.4 for mouse ASIC1a, as conditioning with pH 7.2 decreased pH 5.0-evoked current to 87.8 ± 6.6% (n = 19) maximal current. Steady-state desensitization of human ASIC1a was not observed after conditioning with pH 7.2 (106.2 ± 4.7%, n = 15; p = 0.04 compared with mouse ASIC1a), but a conditioning pH of 7.0 was sufficient to induce steady-state desensitization (Fig. 1D). The calculated half-maximal pH for induction of steady-state desensitization (pH0.5d) of mouse ASIC1a was 7.15 ± 0.01 (n = 12) and 6.91 ± 0.02 for human ASIC1a (n = 9; p = 9.3 × 10–12). Taking into account the relative steepness of these curves, this change may represent a large functional difference in the pH sensitivity of steady-state desensitization. Five Amino Acids Determine the Differences between Mouse and Human ASIC1a—There are 10 amino acid differences between mouse (GenBank™ accession number NM_009597) and human (GenBank™ accession number NM_001095) ASIC1a. Eight of these are located in the extracellular domain of the channel (Fig. 2A), which is known to be important for proton-induced activation and desensitization (22Babini E. Paukert M. Geisler H.S.

To determine which amino acids are responsible for the difference in mouse and human characteristics, we mutated residues in the extracellular domain of human ASIC1a to amino acids found in mouse ASIC1a. We found that human ASIC1a with mutations in five amino acids (A274S/P285S/K291N/ΔD298/ΔL299 or APKDL) completely mimicked mouse ASIC1a. Similar to mouse ASIC1a, a conditioning pH of 7.0 induced substantial steady-state desensitization of the APKDL mutant. For example, the pH 5.0 peak current amplitude after conditioning pH 7.0 was 6.0 ± 1.8% maximal current for APKDL (n = 14), 9.9 ± 2.2% for mouse ASIC1a (n = 27; p = 0.24 compared with APKDL), and 78.9 ± 11.5% for human ASIC1a (n = 13; p = 8.0 × 10–7 compared with APKDL) (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the steady-state desensitization curve of APKDL overlapped with the mouse ASIC1a steady-state desensitization curve (Fig. 2B). The calculated pH0.5d value for APKDL steady-state desensitization was 7.19 ± 0.002 (n = 7), which was not different from mouse ASIC1a (7.15 ± 0.007, n = 12; p = 0.1 compared with APKDL) and was distinct from human ASIC1a"

In a genome-wide microarray assay, the expression of 179 genes was found to be significantly altered due to E5 expression. The expression of lamin A/C was downregulated at protein level. The expression of protein kinase C-delta and phosphoinositide-3-kinase proteins was found to be upregulated. We also observed increased motility of E5-expressing cells. We conclude that the E5 protein affects several cellular pathways involved in cell adhesion, cell motility and mitogenic signaling. These alterations may together lead to inhibition of apoptosis and facilitate the establishment of persistent infection in the epithelium."

This study investigates the binding interfaces of the Rac1-IQGAP1 and Cdc42-IQGAP1 complexes. We mutated Rac1 and Cdc42 and measured the effects of mutations on their affinity for IQGAP1. We have identified similarities and differences in the relative importance of residues used by Rac1 and Cdc42 to bind IQGAP1. Furthermore, the residues involved in the complexes formed with IQGAP1 differ from those formed with other effector proteins and GAPs. Relatively few mutations in switch I of Cdc42 or Rac1 affect IQGAP1 binding; only mutations in residues 32 and 36 significantly decrease affinity for IQGAP1. Switch II mutations also affect binding to IQGAP1 although the effects differ between Rac1 and Cdc42; mutation of either Asp-63, Arg-68, or Leu-70 abrogate Rac1 binding, whereas no switch II mutations affect Cdc42 binding to IQGAP1. The Rho family “insert loop” does not contribute to the binding affinity of Rac1/Cdc42 for IQGAP1. We also present thermodynamic data pertaining to the Rac1/Cdc42-RhoGAP complexes.

In addition we identify “cold spots” in the Rac1/Cdc42-RhoGAP/IQGAP1 interfaces. Competition data reveal that the binding sites for IQGAP1 and RhoGAP on the small G proteins overlap only partially.

The Rho family of small G proteins are well documented to regulate cell motility through their regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (1Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). These small G proteins act as molecular switches, being active in the GTP-bound form and inactive in the GDP-bound form. The interaction of the active, GTP-bound, G protein with an effector protein triggers a downstream signaling cascade. Rho family proteins, acting via these effector proteins, have been shown to control the polymerization of actin in the peripheral cortex of the cell. Cdc42 controls filopodia formation; these are actin-rich fingers that establish the direction of motility. Rac1 controls lamellipodia formation; these actin-rich ruffles at the leading edge of the cell initiate motion, whereas Rho controls the establishment of stress fibers whose formation results in the contractile force that moves the body of the cell behind the leading edge (2Hall A.

IQGAP1 is a 190-kDa protein, originally identified serendipitously in a screen for matrix metalloproteases and named for the presence of four calmodulin-binding IQ motifs and a Ras-GAP-related domain (GRD) (7Weissbach L.

Mammalian cells are now known to contain three IQGAP proteins (IQGAP 1-3), which have a well conserved domain structure and show high levels of homology within the conserved domains (8Brill S.

Although IQGAP1 has a wide tissue distribution, IQGAP2 and -3 are more limited (9Wang S. Watanabe T. Noritake J. Fukata M. Yoshimura T. Itoh N. Harada T. Nakagawa M. Matsuura Y. Arimura N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of a domain homologous to the catalytic domain of the RasGAPs, intact IQGAP1 has no GAP activity toward small G proteins (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N.

Consistent with these findings, overexpression of IQGAP1 in mammalian cells substantially increases the pool of GTP-bound Cdc42, stimulating filopodia formation (13Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z.G. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24753-24763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas knockdown of endogenous IQGAP1 by RNA interference significantly reduces active Cdc42 (15Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z.G. Frank R. Sacks D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Work by several groups has led to the hypothesis that IQGAP1 acts as a scaffold protein that integrates Ca2+/calmodulin signaling with regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and plays an important role in cell-cell adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 6Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar and 16Brown M.D. Sacks D.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 also seems to act as a modulator of receptor signaling, taking inputs from a heterogeneous group of receptors and controlling signal outputs that regulate reactive oxygen species production, MAPK cascades, and β-catenin-mediated transcription (reviewed in Ref. 16Brown M.D. Sacks D.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Again, it functions as a scaffold protein in this context. IQGAP1 consists of a variety of different domains, which mediate binding of a series of proteins. At the N terminus, it has a calponin homology domain through which it is able to bind both Ca2+/calmodulin (14Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z.G. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

This is followed by a WW domain; these motifs are known to bind proline-rich targets, and the IQGAP1 WW domain has been identified as the binding site for ERK1 and -2 (the MAPKs in the Ras-activated, growth-regulating, MAPK cascade) (19Roy M. Li Z.G. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The WW motif is followed by four IQ motifs (IQ1-4), which bind calmodulin either in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Ref. 20Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar and references therein). In IQGAP1, IQ1-4 all bind Ca2+/calmodulin, whereas IQ3 and IQ4 can also bind apocalmodulin (21Li Z.G. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4347-4352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The IQ motifs are also known to be the sites of interaction for MEK1 and -2 (the MAPK kinases in the Ras-controlled MAPK cascade) (22Roy M. Li Z.G. Sacks D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7940-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The GRD of IQGAP1 resides in the C-terminal half of the protein and is presumed to be involved in binding Rac1 and Cdc42 (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A.

Residues at the extreme C terminus of IQGAP1 (termed Ras-GAP_C) are involved in binding to CLIP-170, a microtubule-associated protein (24Fukata M. Watanabe T. Noritake J. Nakagawa M. Yamaga M.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that binding of some partner molecules to IQGAP1 affects the binding of other associated proteins, at least in vitro. Binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to IQGAP1 has been shown to decrease the affinity of IQGAP1 for F-actin. It was proposed that increased intracellular Ca2+ promotes binding of calmodulin to IQGAP1, leading to a concomitant dissociation of IQGAP1 from actin filaments (18Mateer S.C. McDaniel A.E. Nicolas V. Habermacher G.M. Lin M.J.S. Cromer D.A. King M.E. Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12324-12333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that increased Ca2+/calmodulin leads to dissociation of Cdc42 from IQGAP1 (14Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z.G. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Joyal J.L. Ho Y. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 2217Google Scholar). In the case of Ca2+/calmodulin and Cdc42, the binding sites on IQGAP1 are quite distinct, so conformational changes in IQGAP1 induced by Ca2+/calmodulin binding are likely to be involved in the abrogation of the Cdc42 interaction. IQGAP1 has also been shown to have a pivotal role in cell-cell adhesion, co-localizing with both E-cadherin and β-catenin at sites of cell-cell contact (27Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is a Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecule that mediates cell-cell interactions through the formation of homophilic cis- and trans-dimers. The intracellular portion of E-cadherin anchors the cell-cell contacts to the actin cytoskeleton via interactions with β-catenin. β-Catenin subsequently binds to α-catenin, which interacts directly with F-actin (28Fukata M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 is able to interact directly with both E-cadherin and β-catenin (27Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The IQGAP1-binding site on β-catenin overlaps that of α-catenin (29Fukata M. Kuroda S. Nakagawa M. Kawajiri A. Itoh N. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Fujisawa H. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26044-26050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), such that binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin causes β-catenin to dissociate from α-catenin, weakening the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts, because of loss of the stabilizing contacts with the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of Cdc42 has been shown to prevent IQGAP1-dependent dissociation of cell aggregates, presumably by sequestering IQGAP1 away from β-catenin (27Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K.

In a regulatory scenario analogous to the binding of Cdc42 and F-actin, calmodulin has been shown to modulate the binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin (31Briggs M.W. Li Z.G. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7453-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that E-cadherin and calmodulin compete for binding to IQGAP1 (32Li Z.G.

Thus it seems that IQGAP1 may have access to multiple avenues to disrupt cell-cell contacts and that these activities are collectively modulated by calmodulin. Information from structural and thermodynamic studies of protein complexes is integral to rational drug design directed toward either the disruption or stabilization of complexes for therapeutic purposes. The absence of any structural data pertaining to IQGAP1 and the complexes that it forms with Cdc42 and Rac1 prompted us to initiate the study presented here, which aims to delineate regions on the small G proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 that are involved in IQGAP1 binding. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to target regions of the small G proteins indicated by previous studies to be involved in binding effector proteins and/or regulatory GAP proteins. We have identified switch I in both Cdc42 and Rac1 as a region of thermodynamic importance in IQGAP1 binding. The switch II region of small G proteins is an important contact surface for GAP proteins and for some effector proteins. We present here the unexpected finding that switch II in Rac1 is involved in IQGAP1 binding, whereas the same region in Cdc42 seems to be energetically unimportant. The “insert loop,” which is specific to the Rho family of small G proteins, is not thermodynamically involved in the interactions with IQGAP1, although our results indicate that it is in close proximity to the IQGAP1 interface. We have also investigated the G protein binding region of IQGAP1 and present data that imply, unexpectedly, that distinct although overlapping interaction surfaces exist for the two highly related G proteins. The mutations described in this study will be useful tools in delineating the regulation of IQGAP1 by both Cdc42 and Rac1 in vivo. Expression Constructs—All proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the pGEX series of vectors (GE Healthcare). Rac1 Q61L, Cdc42 Q61L, and all other mutants were expressed in pGEX-2T from constructs encoding either residues 1-184 Cdc42 or residues 1-192 Rac1, cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites. Q61L mutations are present in all small G proteins used in this study. This mutation confers GTPase deficiency, stabilizing the active GTP-bound form and therefore the G protein-effector complexes. Henceforth, Rac1 Q61L and Cdc42 Q61L are referred to as Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively. Other mutations are individually specified. Residues 198-439 of RhoGAP, constituting the GAP domain, were expressed as described previously (33Lancaster C.A. Taylorharris P.M. Self A.J. Brill S. Vanerp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 864-1657 and 950-1407 of IQGAP1 were expressed in a modified pGEX-4T vector, which has a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site inserted between GST and IQGAP1 (34Ren J.G. Li Z.G. Crimmins D.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34548-34557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cdc42/Rac1 Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the Cdc42 Q61L and the Rac1 Q61L expression constructs was performed using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the Cdc42 and Rac1 coding regions of all mutants were verified using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) by the DNA Sequencing Facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge. Recombinant Protein Production—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Stationary cultures were diluted 1 in 10, grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8, and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h. Proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The GST-IQGAP1 and GST-RhoGAP fusion proteins were eluted from the glutathione-agarose beads and used directly. GST-Cdc42 and Rac1 and variants were cleaved from their GST tag while attached to the glutathione-agarose beads with thrombin (Merck), and the cleaved G proteins were finally purified by gel filtration (16/60 S75 column, GE Healthcare). Free RhoGAP was prepared in a similar manner. Protein concentrations for all proteins were evaluated from measurement of their A280 using their amino acid compositions and the extinction coefficients of tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and the guanine nucleotide (35Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Exchange—[3H]GTP complexes of Cdc42 and Rac1 proteins were made by nucleotide exchange in the presence of a GTP regeneration system. [8,5′-3H]GTP (0.15 mCi, 26,900 Ci/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was dried by centrifugal evaporation. To this was added Cdc42 or Rac1 protein (0.7 mg in a volume of 0.12 ml), followed by 12 μl of 200 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 μl of 1 m KCl, 15 μl of 3 m NH4(SO4)2, and 5 μl of pyruvate kinase (Sigma), making a final volume of 152.5 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and then 1 μl of 1 m MgCl2 was added. Unbound nucleotide was removed using a 1 ml of G-25 Sephadex (Superfine, GE Healthcare) centrifuge gel filtration column in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Scintillation Proximity Assays (SPA), Direct Binding SPAs—Affinities of Cdc42 and Rac1 proteins for GST-IQGAP1 were measured using SPAs, in which GST fusion protein was attached to a fluoromicrosphere via an anti-GST antibody in the presence of Q61L Cdc42·[3H]GTP or Q61L Rac1·[3H]GTP or mutant variants. Binding of the G protein to the GST-IQGAP1 brings the labeled nucleotide close enough to the scintillant to obtain a signal. Apparent Kd values for Q61L Cdc42·[3H]GTP and Q61L Rac1·[3H]GTP themselves and proteins incorporating further mutations were measured as described previously (36Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) by varying the concentration of Cdc42/Rac1·[3H]GTP at a constant concentration of GST-IQGAP1. These assays were performed with 30 nm GST-IQGAP1. Using this method, the upper and lower limits of the Kd values that can be accurately measured are 1000 and 1 nm, respectively. For each affinity determination, data points were obtained for at least 10 different Cdc42/Rac1 concentrations. Binding curves were fitted using the appropriate binding isotherms to obtain Kd values and their standard errors (36Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Competition SPAs—For competition assays, free Rac1·GMPPNP, Cdc42·GMPPNP, or RhoGAP was titrated into a mixture of 30 nm [3H]GTP·Cdc42/Rac1 and 30 nm GST-IQGAP1 immobilized on fluoromicrospheres as above. The added Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoGAP competes with the GST-effector-[3H]GTP·Cdc42/Rac1 interaction, abolishing the scintillation signal. The highest sample concentrations of competitor used were 2 μm. In each case, a blank was performed in the absence of GST-effector. For each G protein-effector affinity determination, data points were obtained for at least 10 different competitor concentrations. Kd values and their standard errors were obtained by fitting the dose-response curves to binding isotherms that describe competition between two proteins binding to one site on another protein and account for mutual depletion of the interacting components. The value of Kd for the GST-effector-Cdc42/Rac1 interaction was also required, and this was obtained from direct binding SPAs. The equations used were adapted for SPA from the previously published derivations (38Wang Z.X. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 39Collinson A.D. Bligh S.W.A. Graham D.L. Mott H.R. Chalk P.A. Korniotis N. Lowe P.N. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2004; 2: 659-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and have been fully described elsewhere (40Elliot-Smith, A. E., Owen, D., Mott, H. R., and Lowe, P. N. (2007) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Where the data did not appear consistent with a simple competitive model, data were fitted to a model describing partial competition (Scheme 1). In Scheme 1, ternary complexes consisting of either GST-IQGAP bound to both Rac and Cdc42 or GST-IQGAP bound to both RhoGAP and Rac (or Cdc42) exist. The fits used Equation 1, SPAsignal=Smin+(((Smax-Smin)y)/((P-P2-4AoBo)/2))(Eq. 1) where P=Ao+Bo+Kd y=z-z2-4Q2AoBo2Q and Q=IoKd+KicKdiKdiKd(Kic+Io) z=QAo+QBo+1 Smax is the observed SPA signal in the absence of inhibitor, and Smin is the signal in the absence of the GST-effector and inhibitor. Ao is the total concentration of A; Bo is the total concentration of B; Io is the total concentration of inhibitor; Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding A to B; Kic is the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding the inhibitor to A; and Kdi is the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding B to AI. For the experiments where Rac1 and Cdc42 compete for binding to GST-IQGAP1, A is GST-IQGAP1; B is the [3H]GTP·Rac1/Cdc42; and I is the unlabeled Rac1/Cdc42. For the experiments where RhoGAP displaces IQGAP1 from binding to Rac1/Cdc42, A is [3H]GTP·Rac1/Cdc42; B is GST-IQGAP1; and I is RhoGAP. Molecular Modeling—The Rac1-IQGAP1 complex was modeled from the structures of the Ras-RasGAP complex (41Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar) and Rac1 (42Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) using the program MODELLER (43Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of IQGAP1 (residues 864-1657) contains the GRD and encompasses the region that binds to G proteins (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Using SPA, we measured the affinity of this fragment (hereafter IQGAP1) for activated (Q61L) Cdc42 and Rac1. We found that this effector binds Cdc42 and Rac1 with affinities of 24 and 18 nm, respectively (Table 1). The G proteins are 71% identical (Fig. 1), so it might be expected that they would bind IQGAP1 in a similar fashion. We chose to investigate the involvement of several regions of Cdc42 and Rac1 in IQGAP1 binding. This comparison should allow us to determine how similar the modes of interaction of Cdc42 and Rac1 are with this effector.TABLE 1Affinities of switch I mutants of Q61L Cdc42·GTP and Q61L Rac1·GTP mutants for IQGAP1-(864-1657)Apparent Kd values (nm)aEquilibrium binding constants were determined in SPAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kd values are quoted with the standard errors from curve fitting.Cdc42bCdc42 comprises amino acids 1-184 (C-terminally truncated), whereas Rac1 includes amino acids 1-192 (full-length protein). The Kd values for IQGAP1-(864-1657) binding to full-length Rac1 and Rac1-(1-185), as determined by direct SPAs, are identical; therefore, the C-terminal tail of these small G proteins is not involved in the interaction with IQGAP1, and the Cdc42 and Rac1 cons"
https://openalex.org/W2030380217,"The Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor is essential for cell cycle progression and mitosis. FoxM1 regulates expression of Skp2 and Cks1, subunits of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which ubiquitinates p27Kip1 and targets it for degradation. Kinase-interacting stathmin (KIS) is a growth factor-dependent nuclear kinase that regulates cell cycle progression by phosphorylating p27Kip1 to promote its nuclear export. Here we present an additional mechanism of FoxM1-mediated regulation of p27Kip1 and provide evidence that FoxM1 regulates growth factor-induced expression of KIS. In cells harboring FoxM1 deletion or expressing FoxM1-short interfering RNA, the expression of KIS is impaired, leading to an accumulation of p27Kip1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that KIS is a direct transcriptional target of FoxM1. Thus FoxM1 promotes cell cycle progression by down-regulating p27Kip1 through multiple mechanisms.

Furthermore, we show that KIS is a direct transcriptional target of FoxM1. Thus FoxM1 promotes cell cycle progression by down-regulating p27Kip1 through multiple mechanisms. The mammalian Forkhead box family includes more than 50 proteins that operate as transcription factors. Their unique characteristic is shared homology in a winged helix DNA binding domain (1Wang X.

Acta. 2007; 1775: 92-102PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of FoxM1 is induced during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and its expression is maintained during S phase and mitosis (2Ye H. Holterman A.X. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In mice, it is expressed throughout embryonic development and in all proliferating adult cells (3Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Upon terminal differentiation or exit from the cell cycle, expression of FoxM1 is completely extinguished (3Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or exported out of the nucleus (2Ye H. Holterman A.X. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, tumor cells constitutively express FoxM1 (7Pilarsky C. Wenzig M. Specht T. Saeger H.D. Grutzmann R. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of FoxM1 is important for maintenance of the tumor cell phenotype because deletion of the FoxM1 gene or inhibition of the FoxM1 activity by a peptide inhibitor derived from the tumor suppressor ARF leads to regression of hepatocellular carcinomas in mice (8Gusarova G.A. Wang I.C. Major M.L. Kalinichenko V.V. Ackerson T. Petrovic V. Costa R.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Inhibition of FoxM1 by thiazole compounds was also found to correlate with apoptosis of human tumor cells (9Radhakrishnan S.K. Bhat U.G. Hughes D.E. Wang I.C. Costa R.H. Gartel A.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9731-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). FoxM1 is important for transcriptional activation of several genes that regulate G1/S phase progression and the G2/M transition (6Laoukili J. Stahl M. Medema R.H. Biochim. Biophys.

FoxM1 target genes include Cdc25B and Plk1, which are important for the activation of Cdk1 for mitosis (11Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H.

Kerkhoven R.M. Morrison A. Clevers H. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In FoxM1-/- mice, liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is impaired partly because of deficiency in S phase (5Wang X. Kiyokawa H. Dennewitz M.B. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16881-16886Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that defects in S phase progression in FoxM1 null hepatocytes are because of accumulation of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. Aged mice do not express FoxM1 and have higher levels of p27Kip1 in the liver, leading to inefficient liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy (4Wang X. Krupczak-Hollis K. Tan Y.

Interestingly, restoration of FoxM1 expression reduced the level of p27Kip1 and reversed the deficiency in liver regeneration in old mice (4Wang X. Krupczak-Hollis K. Tan Y. Dennewitz M.B. Adami G.R.

The level of p27Kip1 protein is primarily regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (13Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Skp2 and Cks1, specificity subunits of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complexes, play important roles in targeting p27Kip1 for proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (14Carrano A.C.

Previously we showed that FoxM1 directly binds to regulatory elements in promotors of the human Skp2 and Cks1 genes, thereby stimulating their transcription (11Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D.

In quiescent cells, p27Kip1 is expressed at a relatively high level, but levels decrease rapidly upon entry into the G1 phase. Growth factor stimulation of resting cells results in degradation of p27Kip1 protein in cytoplasm (16Alessandrini A. Chiaur D.S. Pagano M. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the growth factor-induced proteolysis of p27Kip1 involves a distinct pathway that is independent of Skp2. Nakayama and co-workers (17Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M.

The KPC pathway of proteolysis of p27Kip1 is not dependent on Thr-187 phosphorylation, which is a prerequisite for Skp2/Cks1-mediated ubiquitination (18Kotoshiba S. Kamura T. Hara T. Ishida N.

Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). KIS is a nuclear protein kinase that possesses an RNA recognition motif, which suggests that it is involved in the control of trafficking and/or splicing of RNAs probably through phosphorylation of associated factors (20Maucuer A. Ozon S. Manceau V. Gavet O. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23151-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was shown that KIS could bind to the C-terminal region of p27Kip1 and phosphorylate it at Ser-10. Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser-10 is essential for its nuclear export and accumulation in the cytoplasm (21Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), where it is targeted for proteolysis by the KPC ligase (17Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). KIS is expressed during growth factor-induced entry into the cell cycle. It has been suggested that KIS promotes cell cycle re-entry by inactivating p27Kip1 following mitogen stimulation (21Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Here we show that FoxM1 regulates KIS expression following growth factor stimulation. FoxM1, by stimulating expression of KIS, enhances phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser-10 leading to increased proteolysis of p27Kip1. Our results provide further evidence that FoxM1 is important for growth factor-induced proteolysis of p27Kip1. kinase-interacting stathmin short interfering RNA mouse embryonic fibroblast bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole cytomegalovirus chromatin immunoprecipitation reverse transcription wild type diethylnitrosamine phenobarbital sense antisense annealing temperature hepatocellular carcinoma Cell Culture and Cell Fractions—U2OS cells were obtained from the ATCC (HTB-96) and maintained as a monolayer using the conditions described previously (11Wang I.C.

U2OS cells were harvested 48 h after FoxM1 siRNA transfection for total RNA or 72 h after FoxM1 siRNA transfection to prepare protein extracts for Western blot analysis or immunofluorescent staining. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Protein preparation and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (24Kalinichenko V.V. Major M.L. Wang X. Petrovic V. Kuechle J. Yoder H.M. Dennewitz M.B.

Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The signals from the primary antibody were amplified by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; Bio-Rad) and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). The following commercially available antibodies and dilutions were used for immunoblotting: mouse anti-β-actin (AC-15; 1:5000) (Sigma), mouse anti-p27Kip1 (1:3000) (BD Transduction Laboratories), and rabbit anti-KIS (AP8067a 1:1000) (Abgent, San Diego). The mouse anti-phospho-Ser-10 p27Kip1 antibody (1:1000) was a gift from Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel, Cardiovascular Branch, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health. Rabbit antisera specific for the human C-terminal FoxM1 protein region (1:5000) was obtained as described previously (11Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Staining of U2OS Cells—U2OS cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Fisher). After washing in PBS with 1% BSA, proteins of interest were visualized by staining cells with specific antibodies in PBS containing 0.5% BSA at 25 °C for 16 h. Mouse anti-p27Kip1 (1:200) (BD Transduction Laboratories) was used for immunofluorescent staining. After being washed with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:100; DakoCytomation, Denmark) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA at 25 °C for 30 min. The slides were washed with PBS, and cover glasses were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; H-1200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence was performed with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Primers Used for Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) to Determine mRNA Expression Levels—RNA was isolated from U2OS cells or MEFs using RNA-STAT-60 (Tel-Test B Inc., Friendswood, TX). Following RNase-free DNase I (New England Biolabs, Boston) digestion of total RNA to remove contaminating genomic DNA, we used the Bio-Rad cDNA synthesis kit containing both oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers to synthesize cDNA from 10 μg of total RNA. The following reaction mixture was used for all PCR samples: 1×IQ SybrGreen supermix (Bio-Rad), 100-200 nm of each primer, and 2.5 μl of cDNA in a 25-μl total volume. Reactions were amplified and analyzed in triplicate using a MyiQ single-color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The following sense (S) and antisense (AS) primer sequences and annealing temperatures (Ta) were used to amplify and measure the amount of human mRNA by real time RT-PCR: FoxM1-S, 5′-GGA GGA AAT GCC ACA CTT AGC G-3′, and FoxM1-AS, 5′-TAG GAC TTC TTG GGT CTT GGG GTG-3′ (Ta, 55.7 °C); KIS-S, 5′-CCA TCA CGC TGT CTG TTG CTT G-3′, and KIS-AS, 5′-GGG CAC AAT GCT GTA TCA TCC AC-3′ (Ta, 61.3 °C). These real time RT-PCR RNA levels were normalized to human cyclophilin mRNA levels, and these primers are as follows: cyclophilin-S, 5′-GCA GAC AAG GTC CCA AAG ACA G-3′, and cyclophilin-AS, 5′-CAC CCT GAC ACA TAA ACC CTG G-3′ (Ta, 55.7 °C). The following sense and antisense primer sequences and annealing temperatures were used to amplify and measure the amount of mouse mRNA by real time RT-PCR: FoxM1-S, 5′-CAC TTG GAT TGA GGA CCA CTT-3′, and FoxM1-AS, 5′-GTC GTT TCT GCT GTG ATT CC-3′ (Ta, 57.5 °C); KIS-S, 5′-AGT ATG GTT TCC GCA AAG AGA GG-3′, and KIS-AS, 5′-ATG GCA CAT TGG GAG AGA AGT G-3′ (Ta, 52.0 °C); cyclinD1-S, 5′-CCT GAC ACC AAT CTC CTC AAC G-3′, and cyclin D1-AS 5′-TCT TCG CAC TTC TGC TCC TCA C-3′ (Ta, 62.0 °C); and cyclin E1-S 5′-GAA AGA AGA AGG TGG CTC CGA C-3′, and cyclin E1-AS 5′-GTT AGG GGT GGG GAT GAA AGA G-3′ (Ta, 62.0 °C). These real time RT-PCR RNA levels were normalized to mouse cyclophilin mRNA levels, and these primers were as follows: cyclophilin-S, 5′-GGC AAA TGC TGG ACC AAA CAC-3′, and cyclophilin-AS, 5′-TTC CTG GAC CCA AAA CGC TC-3′ (Ta, 57.5 °C). Preparation of KIS Promoter/Binding Sites; Luciferase Constructs and Dual Luciferase Assays—We used PCR to amplify a 1.1-kb region of the human KIS promoter from genomic DNA. This PCR-amplified promoter region was cloned in the correct orientation in the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). Additional DNA duplexes representing putative FoxM1 23-kb binding site and its mutant were cloned in front of the -1.1-kb promoter region. Oligonucleotides used for creating DNA duplexes were: CGA TTT TGT TTG TTT GTT TTT GC and TCG AGC AAA AAC AAA CAA ACA AAA TCG GTA C for the intact region and CAA TTT TAT TTA TTT ATT TTT AC and TCG AGG AAA AAG AAA GAA AGA AAA TGG GTA C for the mutated site. The following PCR primers were used to amplify the KIS promoter region: forward, 5′-AAA TAA AAA TTT GGA ACA GAT C-3′; reverse, 5′-CAG CCA TGA CAC CGG AAG CCG T-3′. The KIS kinase promoter region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. We used FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) to transfect U2OS cells with 200 ng of either cytomegalovirus (CMV) FoxM1 expression construct or CMV empty vector with 1.5 μg of -1.1-kb KIS promoter or -1.1-kb promoter fused with either intact or mutated binding site duplex luciferase reporter with 10 ng of CMV-Renilla luciferase, which served as an internal control. Luciferase assays were performed as described (25Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Expression was represented as the fold induction of transcriptional activity by the FoxM1 expression vector ± the S.D., where binding site fused promoter activity resulting from transfection with CMV empty vector was set at 1. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and statistical analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel tools. ChIP Assay—FoxM1-depleted or untreated U2OS cells were processed for ChIP assays 3 days after siRNA transfection using published methods (26Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation step, specific amounts of antibody as indicated were added to the precleared and clarified sample, which was incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 12-16 h and washed according to ChIP assay protocol (Upstate). The following antibodies were used in the indicated amounts: 10, 25, or 50 μl of rabbit antiserum specific for FoxM1 protein (amino acids 365-748) and 2 μg of rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). We used 2.5 μl of ChIP DNA sample in the subsequent 25-μl real time PCR mixtures. The total input sample was diluted 1:10, and 2.5 μl was used for real time PCR (10% total input). PCR Primers and Reaction Conditions for ChIP Assay—The primers used to amplify the following human gene fragments are annotated with the binding position relevant to the transcription start site, annealing temperature, and whether in the sense or antisense orientation: KIS 1.3S, 5′-CAA TGG CGA GAT CAC AGT TCA CTC-3′, and KIS 1.3AS, 5′-ATT AGC CAG GCT TGG TGC TAC G-3′ (Ta, 62 °C); KIS 23S, 5′-GAG CAC ATA CAG TGT CGT GAT CTT G-3, and KIS 23AS, 5′-CAA AAT CTA ACT GGG CGT GAT AGC-3 (Ta, 62 °C); and KIS 33S, 5′-TCT GTA TTC CTA GCA CCT AGC CCC-3, and KIS 33AS, 5′-CCA ACT GGA TGC CAG ATT CTA TG-3 (Ta, 62 °C). The following reaction mixture was used for all PCR samples: 1× IQ SybrGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad), 100 nm of each primer, and 2.5 μl of each purified ChIP extract in a 25-μl total volume. Reactions were amplified and analyzed in triplicate using a MyiQ single color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Normalization was carried out using the Ct method as described previously (11Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments were performed with the U2OS cell nuclear extract isolated as described above. We used 3.5 pmol of the double-stranded FoxM1-binding site oligonucleotide for radioactive labeling with [32P]ATP isotope (ICN, Irvine, CA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). Formation of the FoxM1 protein-DNA complex was performed by incubating ∼0.2 pmol of 32P-labeled FoxM1-binding site oligonucleotide, 2 μg of U2OS cell nuclear protein extract, and 1× gel shift buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 20 min at room temperature. The FoxM1 protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel run at 4 °C and detected by autoradiography as described previously (27Rausa F.M. Tan Y. Zhou H. Yoo K.W. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Franks R.R. Unterman T.G. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8264-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We also performed DNA competitions that included in the binding reaction mixture a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled FoxM1-binding site oligonucleotide from a mouse CDX2 promoter as described previously (control) (28Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Experiments were repeated three times, and results were combined and represented graphically as the mean values ± S.D. We used the Microsoft Excel program to calculate the S.D. and statistically significant differences between samples using the Student's t test. The asterisks in each graph indicate statistically significant changes, with p values calculated by the Student t test. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. FoxM1-depleted Cells Fail to Regulate p27Kip1 Protein Expression in Response to Serum Stimulation—When quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were stimulated by serum addition, they entered the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and levels of endogenous p27Kip decreased. To examine regulation of p27Kip1 in FoxM1-depleted MEFs, we used a Cre Lox system to delete the FoxM1 alleles by delivering Cre recombinase via an adenoviral vector into MEFs containing two LoxP sites surrounding essential FoxM1 exons 4-7. These MEFs were kept in low serum conditions (0.1%) for 60 h to render them quiescent, after which medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Nuclear cell protein extracts were prepared from these synchronized cells at 0, 12, 18, 24, and 36 h following serum addition and used for immunoblot analysis with p27Kip1-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1A). In the control AdLacZ-infected MEFs, dramatic down-regulation of p27Kip1 protein levels was observed after serum stimulation. However, p27Kip1 levels did not decrease in AdCre-infected, FoxM1-deficient MEFs. Similar results were also obtained with FoxM1-depleted MEFs from FoxM1-/- mouse embryos (data not shown). Even though the FoxM1-depleted quiescent cells were stimulated by high serum concentration, they failed to down-regulate nuclear and total p27Kip1 protein expression as compared with their FoxM1-expressing counterpart cells. This suggests that FoxM1 is involved in regulation of p27Kip1 metabolism and nuclear export in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, we observed lower p27Kip1 levels in FoxM1-depleted MEFs at the 0 h timepoint when compared with control cells, which may be due to some sort of compensatory effect allowing these cells to adapt for survival under in vitro conditions with marginal levels of FoxM1 expression. FoxM1 Is Essential for Expression of KIS Gene—KIS is an important regulator of p27Kip1 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. KIS phosphorylates p27Kip1 on Ser-10, promoting its nuclear export and degradation in the cytoplasm (21Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because FoxM1-depleted cells fail to down-regulate p27Kip1 expression upon serum stimulation, we set out to test whether FoxM1 is involved in the regulation of KIS expression. We rendered either FoxM1-/- MEFs (Fig. 2A) or WT MEFs (Fig. 2B) quiescent as described above, and isolated total RNA from these cells at the indicated time points following serum addition. These RNA extracts were used for real time RT-PCR analysis with primers specific for mouse FoxM1 and KIS mRNA (Fig. 2). FoxM1-/- MEFs showed no significant change in KIS mRNA expression even 24 h following serum stimulation, whereas WT MEFs displayed rapid onset of FoxM1 and KIS mRNA induction after the serum was added. We also analyzed the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 mRNA in FoxM1-/- cells and demonstrated changes in expression of both genes, suggesting that cells were able to progress through the cell cycle, indicating that lack of KIS up-regulation was not because of cell cycle arrest but rather FoxM1 deficiency. Next we compared levels of KIS mRNA in asynchronous cells. WT and FoxM1-/- MEFs were subjected to real time RT-PCR analysis that shows significantly diminished expression of KIS mRNA in FoxM1-/- MEFs as compared with WT cells (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether KIS mRNA expression is regulated by FoxM1 in human cells, we transfected U2OS cells with 100 nm siFoxM1 or control si duplexes and determined the relative mRNA expression as described above. FoxM1 depleted U2OS cells show substantial down-regulation of KIS mRNA expression as compared with untransfected or control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we found that overexpression of FoxM1 leads to an increase in KIS protein expression. U2OS cells were transfected with either the empty CMV vector as control or a CMV promoter-FoxM1 expression construct. Total cell protein extracts were isolated 72 h following transfection and subjected to immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies specific for FoxM1 and KIS (Fig. 3C). The U2OS cells ectopically expressing FoxM1 displayed elevated expression of KIS protein when compared with control cells. Together these results suggest that FoxM1 is essential for regulating the expression of KIS kinase, which is critical for phosphorylation and inactivation of p27Kip1 protein during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. FoxM1 Is Required for KIS-mediated Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Ser-10 and Nuclear Export—Previous studies indicated that KIS kinase is necessary for phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Ser-10 (21Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To determine whether FoxM1 expression affects phosphorylation of Ser-10 on p27Kip1 protein, we transfected U2OS cells with either siFoxM1 or a CMV-FoxM1 expression construct and isolated total cell protein extracts. Immunoprecipitations were performed with monoclonal p27Kip1 antibody. Immunoblotting performed with Ser-10 phosphospecific antibody revealed lower levels of Ser-10 phosphorylation in FoxM1-depleted cells and higher levels in cells ectopically expressing FoxM1 as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4A). The increase in phosphorylation is dramatic because p27Kip1 is down-regulated in c"
https://openalex.org/W2001075788,"The polypeptide toxin ShK is a potent blocker of Kv1.3 potassium channels, which are crucial in the activation of human effector memory T cells (TEM); selective blockers constitute valuable therapeutic leads for the treatment of autoimmune diseases mediated by TEM cells, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type-1 diabetes. The critical motif on the toxin for potassium channel blockade consists of neighboring lysine and tyrosine residues. Because this motif is sufficient for activity, an ShK analogue was designed based on d-amino acids. d-Allo-ShK has a structure essentially identical with that of ShK and is resistant to proteolysis. It blocked Kv1.3 with Kd 36 nm (2,800-fold lower affinity than ShK), was 2-fold selective for Kv1.3 over Kv1.1, and was inactive against other K+ channels tested. d-Allo-ShK inhibited human TEM cell proliferation at 100-fold higher concentration than ShK. Its circulating half-life was only slightly longer than that of ShK, implying that renal clearance is the major determinant of its plasma levels. d-Allo-ShK did not bind to the closed state of the channel, unlike ShK. Models of d-allo-ShK bound to Kv1.3 show that it can block the pore as effectively as ShK but makes different interactions with the vestibule, some of which are less favorable than for native ShK. The finding that an all-d analogue of a polypeptide toxin retains biological activity and selectivity is highly unusual. Being resistant to proteolysis and nonantigenic, this analogue should be useful in K+ channel studies; all-d analogues with improved Kv1.3 potency and specificity may have therapeutic advantages.

Calabresi P.A. Allie R. Yun S. Pennington M. Beeton C. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1703-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Kv1.3 channels dominate in terminally differentiated effector memory (TEM) cells, and Kv1.3 blockers inhibit the activation of these cells, whereas KCa3.1 blockers are ineffective (23Wulff H.

ShK has a short half-life in vivo (∼ 30 min) (25Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O. Pennington M. Bernard D. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Beraud E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As a means of dissecting the relative importance of these processes and of possibly lengthening the half-life of ShK in vivo, an analogue resistant to proteolysis would be valuable. A strategy to achieve this is offered by the minimalist nature of the crucial functional motif of the toxin. The dyad of a lysine and neighboring aromatic residue (7Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C.L. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Menez A. J. Biol.

Pennington M.W. Wulff H. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 3041-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The potent activity conferred by these two residues in the context of a wide variety of toxins suggests a high level of tolerance in the scaffold that presents them on the toxin surface. Therefore, a mirror image of ShK toxin in which all amino acids have the enantiomeric (mirror image) configuration but that maintains the spatial arrangement of these critical residues might also bind to and block the channel, while being completely resistant to proteolysis as a result of its inability to be recognized by endogenous proteases. In this paper we describe the synthesis, structural characterization, channel binding, and in vivo evaluation of an analogue of ShK in which all residues have the d-configuration at Cα. The side chain configurations were unchanged, so this analogue should be described as d-allo-ShK, although it is only for Thr and Ile that the side chain configurations differ from the exact mirror image (because each contains a chiral center). We therefore refer to it as a diastereomer of ShK toxin rather than an enantiomer. Peptide Synthesis—Fmoc 3The abbreviations used are:FmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylNOESYnuclear Overhauser enhancement spectrometryRPreversed phaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMDmolecular dynamicsDTHdelayed-type hypersensitivityTCMcentral memory TTEMeffector memory T. d-amino acids (Bachem Feinchemikalien) included d-Arg(Pmc), d-Asp(OtBu), d-Cys-(Trt), d-Gln(Trt), d-His(Trt), d-Lys(Boc), d-Ser(tBu), and d-Thr(tBu). All other non-side chain protected derivatives used for synthesis were also in the d-configuration except for Gly, which is achiral. Stepwise assembly was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer at the 0.25-mmol scale using Fmoc-Ramage™-amide-resin. Residues 34-22 were single coupled. At this point, half of the resin was removed to effect better mixing. The remainder of the peptide sequence was double coupled to the remaining resin aliquot. All of the couplings were mediated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in the presence of 2 eq of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Following final removal of the Fmoc group, the peptide resin (2.42 g) was cleaved from the resin and simultaneously deprotected using reagent K (27King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature. Following cleavage, the peptide was filtered to remove the spent resin beads and precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether. The peptide was collected on a fine filter funnel, washed with ice-cold ether, and finally extracted with 20% AcOH in H2O. The peptide extract was subsequently diluted into 2 liters of H2O, the pH adjusted to 8.0 with NH4OH and allowed to air oxidize at room temperature for 36 h. Following oxidation of the disulfide bonds, the peptide solution was acidified to pH 2.5 and pumped onto a Rainin Dynamax C18 column (5.0 × 30 cm). The sample was eluted with a linear gradient from 5 to 30% acetonitrile into H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting fractions were analyzed using two analytical RP-HPLC systems: trifluoroacetic acid and triethylammonium phosphate (28Rivier J. McClintock R. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 268: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Pure fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Upon lyophilization, 120 mg of d-allo-ShK toxin amide was obtained, representing a theoretical yield of 21% (from the starting resin).

Two-dimensional homonuclear total correlation spectra with a spin-lock time of 60 ms and double quantum filtered correlation NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer. A two-dimensional NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 200 ms was also acquired on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer. NOESY spectra for ShK were acquired at 500 and 600 MHz as described previously (3Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Tudor J.E. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the 600-MHz NOESY was used in the comparison with d-allo-ShK. Water was suppressed using the WATERGATE pulse sequence (29Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenáø V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). All of the spectra were collected at 20 °C unless otherwise stated and were referenced to an impurity peak at 0.15 ppm or to the water resonance. Diffusion measurements were performed using a pulsed field gradient longitudinal eddy current delay pulse sequence (30Gibbs S.J. Johnson C.S. J. Magn.

Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Structural figures were prepared using VMD (34Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 27-38Crossref Scopus (35757) Google Scholar). Proteolytic Digestion—The stability of d-allo-ShK to proteolytic digestion was investigated under the same conditions used to determine the disulfide bridges of ShK toxin (35Pohl J. Hubalek F. Byrnes M.E. Nielsen K.R. Woods A. Pennington M.W. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 291-297Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). d-Allo-ShK (15 μg) was dissolved in 0.05 m HEPES, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2 (30 μl) and trypsin, chymotrypsin, or a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin (enzyme:substrate1:50, w/w, 30 °C, 6 h). The digestion was terminated by acidification with 10% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (3 μl), the solution was centrifuged (13,000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant was analyzed directly by RP-HPLC. Modeling and Docking—An initial model of d-allo-ShK was created by inverting the structure of ShK derived by NMR (3Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Base code 1ROO, structure 1) and correcting the side chains of threonine and isoleucine residues for the appropriate stereochemistry. Both the d-allo model and NMR-derived structures were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the GROMACS (v3.3.1) package of programs (36Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). All of the simulations consisted of an initial minimization of water molecules followed by 100 ps of MD with the peptide fixed. Following positional restraints MD, the restraints on the peptide were removed, and MD continued for a further 10 ns. MD simulations of both diastereomers of ShK were performed using the OPLS-aa force field (37Jorgensen W.L. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar). Ionizable residues were assumed to be in their standard state at neutral pH. Each peptide was placed in a 50 × 50 × 50 Å3 water box with no pressure coupling. The total charge on the system was made neutral by replacing water molecules with chloride ions using the Genion program. Peptide, water, and ions were coupled separately to a thermal bath at 300 K using a Berendsen thermostat (38Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (22550) Google Scholar) applied with a coupling time of 0.1 ps. All of the simulations were performed with a single nonbonded cut-off of 10 Å, applying a neighbor list update frequency of 10 steps (20 fs). The particle mesh Ewald method was used to account for long range electrostatics, applying a grid width of 1.2 Å, and a fourth-order spline interpolation. Bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS algorithm (39Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1977; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (10848) Google Scholar). All of the simulations consisted of an initial minimization of water molecules followed by 100 ps of MD with the peptide fixed. Following positional restraints MD, the restraints on the peptide were removed, and MD continued for a further 10 ns. Comparative models of the trans-membrane region (only) of the murine Kv1.3 channel were constructed using the x-ray structure of the K+ channel from Streptomyces lividans (KcsA, Protein Data Base code 1BL8) as a template. The MODELLER (6v2) program (40Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) was used to create nine models based on the sequence alignment shown in supplemental Table S2. mKv1.3 has good sequence similarity with KcsA over the entire pore domain (32% identity), whereas there is 91% sequence identity with Kv1.2. Despite the greater sequence similarity with Kv1.2, the structure of KcsA was chosen as the template for model building because the structure of the two loops comprising the extracellular face of KcsA, the site of toxin binding, has been well characterized (41Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar), whereas those in the more closely related channel, Kv1.2, are disordered in the electron density (42Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar), and are therefore less suitable for model building. Complexes of the d-allo and l forms of ShK with mKv1.3 were modeled using the ZDOCK program (43Chen R. Li L. Weng Z. Proteins. 2003; 52: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). This program uses a fast Fourier transform to explore all of the possible binding modes of the two proteins; docking was restricted to residues on the extracellular surface of the channel to ensure the exclusion of unphysical binding predictions. The interaction is evaluated using shape complementarity, desolvation energy, and electrostatics. Models of each form of the toxin were extracted at 1-ns intervals during the MD simulation. Including the initial model, we considered 11 models of each form of the toxin. Each model of the toxin was docked with one of the nine models of the channel; thus, we considered all 99 possible combinations of toxin with channel for both d-allo and l forms of the toxin.

https://openalex.org/W2074927061,"T helper cells can support the functions of CD8(+) T cells against persistently infecting viruses such as murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus and HIV. These viruses often resist complete elimination and remain detectable at sanctuary sites, such as the kidneys and other extralymphatic organs. The mechanisms underlying this persistence are not well understood. Here we show that mice with potent virus-specific T-cell responses have reduced levels and delayed formation of neutralizing antibodies, and these mice fail to clear LCMV from extralymphatic epithelia. Transfer of virus-specific B cells but not virus-specific T cells augmented virus clearance from persistent sites. Virus elimination from the kidneys was associated with the formation of IgG deposits in the interstitial space, presumably from kidney-infiltrating B cells. CD8(+) T cells in the kidneys of mice that did not clear virus from this site were activated but showed evidence of exhaustion. Thus, we conclude that in this model of infection, site-specific virus persistence develops as a consequence of potent immune activation coupled with reductions in virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that sanctuary-site formation depends both on organ anatomy and on the induction of different adaptive immune effector mechanisms. Boosting T-cell responses alone may not reduce virus persistence."

The trabecular meshwork (TM), a specialized eye tissue, is believed to be involved, at least in part, in the development of glaucoma. The myocilin expression is known to be up-regulated by glucocorticoids in TM cells, and an altered myocilin level may be the culprit in conditions such as corticosteroid glaucoma. Wild type myocilin, when transfected into cultured human TM cells, induced a dramatic loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Myocilin transfectants displayed a heightened sensitivity to trypsin. Adhesion to fibronectin, collagens, and vitronectin was compromised. The fibronectin deposition and the levels of fibronectin protein and mRNA were also reduced in myocilin transfectants. The fibronectin deposition could be restored by treatment with lysophosphatidic acid, a Rho stimulator. Assays further revealed that upon myocilin overexpression, the activity of RhoA was diminished, whereas the cAMP level and the protein kinase A (PKA) activity were augmented. Myocilin protein did not affect actin polymerization. The collapse of actin stress fibers and increased trypsin sensitivity from myocilin transfection could be reverted by co-expression of constitutively active RhoA or by treatment with PKA inhibitor H-89. The PKA activity, however, was not modified by co-expression of either constitutively active or dominant negative RhoA. These results demonstrate that myocilin has a deadhesive activity and triggers signaling events. cAMP/PKA activation and the downstream Rho inhibition are possible mechanisms by which myocilin in overabundance may lead to TM cell or tissue damage.

Both the cells and the ECM in the TM may contribute to the flow resistance (2Yue B.Y.J.T. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1996; 40: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 7Tian B. Peters D.M. Kaufman P.L. Curr. Opin. Ophthalmol. 2006; 17: 168-174PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that changes in the cell shape, volume, contractility, cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, and/or the quantity and composition of the ECM may affect the dimensions, direction, or resistance of the outflow pathway. High resistance to aqueous humor drainage may lead to elevated intraocular pressure and ultimately glaucoma, a heterogeneous disease generally characterized by neural loss and visual impairment. Myocilin is the product of the GLC1A gene that has been linked directly to both juvenile and adult onset open angle glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma (8Stone E.M. Fingert J.H. Alward W.L. Nguyen T.D. Polansky J.R. Sunden S.L.F. Nishimura D. Clark A.F. Nystuen A. Nichols B.E. Mackey D.A. Ritch R. Kalenak J.W. Craven E.E. Sheffield V.C. Science. 1997; 275: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Multiple mutations have been identified in a number of families (8Stone E.M. Fingert J.H. Alward W.L. Nguyen T.D. Polansky J.R. Sunden S.L.F. Nishimura D. Clark A.F. Nystuen A. Nichols B.E. Mackey D.A. Ritch R. Kalenak J.W. Craven E.E. Sheffield V.C.

Myocilin was initially identified as a 57-/55-kDa protein secreted into the medium of TM cultures after induction with glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone (10Nguyen T. Chen P. Huang W. Chen H. Johnson D. Polansky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6341-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The myocilin mRNA and protein are present in a variety of ocular and nonocular tissues, including the retina and the TM (11Tamm E.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2002; 21: 395-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). That myocilin expression can be induced dramatically by dexamethasone has been shown to be a distinct feature of TM cells (10Nguyen T. Chen P. Huang W. Chen H. Johnson D. Polansky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6341-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 12Wentz-Hunter K. Shen X. Yue B.Y.J.T. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 308-314PubMed Google Scholar). Myocilin, localized to both intracellular and extracellular sites in TM cells and tissue (11Tamm E.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2002; 21: 395-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Ueda J.

When up-regulated, myocilin may lead to pathology as is observed perhaps in cases of corticosteroid glaucoma (14Clark A.F. J. Glaucoma. 1995; 4: 354-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has also been provided that myocilin with mutations in the C terminus cannot be secreted. These mutants, in addition, suppress secretion of the wild type myocilin, resulting in intracellular accumulations (11Tamm E.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2002; 21: 395-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Caballero M. Rowlete L.L. Borras T. Biochim. Biophys.

Alward W.L.M. Stone E.M. Abbott A.F. Sheffield V.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). An earlier report from our laboratory showed that transfection of myocilin into cultured human TM cells caused a loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, compromising cell adhesion to fibronectin and cell spreading (17Wentz-Hunter K. Shen X. Okazaki K. Tanihara H. Yue B.Y.J.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further determined the biologic effects of myocilin. Specifically, the consequences of overexpressed myocilin on cell-matrix cohesiveness and matrix production in TM cells were investigated. The myocilin-induced events were shown to be mediated via Rho GTPase and cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Cell Culture—Normal human eyes were obtained from the Illinois Eye Bank (Chicago, IL) or the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). TM cells were derived from 11-, 21-, 22-, 32-, 33-, 43-, 46-, 47-, and 52-year-old donors without any known ocular diseases. The procurement of tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The TM tissues were dissected and cultured as previously described (18Yue B.Y.J.T. Higginbotham E. Chang I. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) on Falcon Primaria flasks (BD Biosciences) in complete medium that contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium, glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, and antibiotics. Second or third passaged cells were used for the study. The TM cells displayed a polygonal morphology with a growth pattern distinct from that of fibroblastic and corneal endothelial cultures. They stained positively with DiI-acetylated low density lipoprotein (Invitrogen), consistent with previous reports that TM cells possess receptors for modified LDL (19Chang I.L. Elner S.G.

In parallel experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (positive control) stained strongly, whereas human corneal fibroblasts (negative control) did not react with DiI-acetylated low density lipoprotein, as expected (data not shown). Transfection of Constructs into TM Cells—Wild type myocilin was amplified by PCR using 5′-CCACCATGGCTATGAGGTTCTTCTGTGCACGTTGC-3′ antisense and 5′-TATCACATCTTGGAGAGCTTGATGTCATA-3′ sense primers. The 1.5-kilobase myocilin PCR product was subcloned using TA cloning into pTarget (Promega), a mammalian expression vector utilizing cytomegalovirus promoter and containing the neomycin gene for selection, to yield pTarget-myocilin. For construction of pMyocilin-EGFP, PCR was performed, and the EcoRI/BamHI-digested PCR product was cloned into pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) at the corresponding sites. The expression plasmid (pOptineurin-EGFP) for optineurin, another glaucoma gene, was constructed as previously described (22Park B.C. Shen X. Samaraweera M. Yue B.Y.J.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1976-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed to determine the proper orientation and confirm the construct sequences. pTarget-myocilin, pMyocilin-EGFP, or pOptineurin-EGFP was introduced into human TM cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) (17Wentz-Hunter K. Shen X. Okazaki K. Tanihara H. Yue B.Y.J.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or Lipofectamine Plus and Lifofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). TM cells were plated at 60% confluence 18 h before transfection. The vector/transfection reagent mixture was added to the cells for 24-48 h. As mock controls, TM cells were transfected in parallel with pTarget empty vector without the insert or vector pEGFP-N1. In some experiments, TM cells were co-transfected with myocilin plasmids and RhoA expression vectors. Plasmids encoding constitutively active (ca) RhoA (V14 RhoA) and dominant negative (dn) RhoA (N19 RhoA) were gifts of Dr. Thomas Leung (IMCB, Singapore). For these vectors, human wild type RhoA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 at EcoRI and XbaI. The G14V or T19N mutation was introduced into RhoA via the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to confer a ca or dn phenotype. Western Blot Analysis—Transfected TM cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium for 24 h. The media were collected, and TM cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The proteins in the lysate were quantified by Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots of lysates or medium (20 μg of protein equivalent) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Western blotting was performed using polyclonal anti-myocilin (1:2000; a gift from Dr. Daniel Stamer, University of Arizona) (23Hardy K.M. Hoffman E.A. Gonzalez P. McKay B.S. Stamer W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28917-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or anti-fibronectin (1:1000; BD Biosciences) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Cappel). The protein bands were detected using SuperSignal Substrate from Pierce. Densitometric analysis was performed to measure the intensity of the myocilin or fibronectin bands with the use of 1D Image Analysis software from Eastman Kodak Co. Relative Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from TM cells using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), and cDNAs were prepared using random hexamers (SuperScript first strand synthesis system; Invitrogen). Relative quantitative RT-PCR was conducted using the QuantumRNA universal 18 S ribosomal RNA primer kit (Ambion) with myocilin sense (5′-ATGAGGTTCTTCTGTGCAACGTTGGCTGC) and antisense (5′-TCCAACCTCCTGGCCAGATTCTC) primers and a 1:4 ratio of 18 S primers to competimers or fibronectin sense (5′-GGTGGCTGTCAGTCAAAGCAAGC-3′) and antisense (5′-TGAGGCTGCGGTTGGTAAACAG-3′) primers and a 1:3 18 S primer/competimer ratio. The expected sizes of the myocilin, fibronectin, and 18 S RNA PCR products were 464, 771, and 315 bp, respectively. The RT step was omitted in negative controls. PCR products were resolved on agarose gels and quantified by densitometry. The level of myocilin or fibronectin transcript was normalized to the 18 S RNA product. Cell-Matrix Adhesiveness Assay—CytoMatrix cell adhesion strips (Chemicon/Millipore) coated with ECM proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen types I and IV, were used. pTarget-myocilin-transfected TM cells were suspended from flasks using nonenzymatic dissociation buffer. 40,000 cells were added to each well of the rehydrated strips for a 45-min, 37 °C incubation. The unattached cells were removed, and the remaining ones were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 10% ethanol. The dye associated with attached cells was solubilized for measurement of absorbance at 560 nm. Values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t tests were used to analyze the statistical significance of the data. All assays were conducted in triplicate, and all experiments were repeated three times. Trypsin Sensitivity—Mock and myocilin- or optineurin-transfected TM cells grown to confluence on 24-well plates were treated with Versene and incubated with 0.25% trypsin. Cell changes were monitored and photographed under a phase-contrast microscope. The time (mean ± S.D.) needed for the cells to shrink, round up, and break away from the bottom of the culture plate was determined (3Zhou L. Fukuchi T. Kawa J.E. Higginbotham E.J. Yue B.Y.J.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Res. 1995; 36: 787-795PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin sensitivity was also examined using time lapse video microscopy. Cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1 and pMyocilin-EGFP or pOptineurin-EGFP for 24 h. The cells were observed under a Zeiss Axioscope (Carl Zeiss Micro-Imaging) using a ×40 objective. Images were captured before and every 30 s after the addition of 0.25% trypsin solution to the culture. Immunofluorescence and Actin Staining—Transfected human TM cells were plated onto Lab-Tek CC2 glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). Cells were fixed in either ice-cold methanol or paraformaldehyde-lysine-phosphate buffer, without or with permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100. After treatment of 3% H2O2 and blocking, the slides were incubated for 1 h with monoclonal anti-fibronectin or anti-vinculin (Chemicon). Normal mouse IgG was used as a negative control. The cells were further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-IgG or Cy3-goat anti-mouse IgG. Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. The staining was examined under a Leica confocal or a Zeiss 100M microscope. In some experiments, transfected cells were pretreated with 5 μm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) for 16 h prior to the fibronectin staining. The actin structure in normal untransfected and pTarget-myocilin-, pMyocilin-EGFP-, or pOptineurin-EGFP-transfected cells was examined using Oregon Green 488- or rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). In some experiments, pMyocilin-EGFP-transfected cells were mixed with pDsRed-Monomer-C1 (BD Biosciences)-transfected ones in the same culture dishes, and the actin was stained with Alexa Fluor 350-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). pEGFP-N1- or pMyocilin-EGFP-transfected TM cells were also co-transfected with ca V14 or dn V12 RhoA. In other experiments, normal untransfected or pEGFP-N1- or pMyocilin-EGFP-transfected cells were treated overnight with cAMP-enhancing agent forskolin (50 μm; Sigma) or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX (500 μm); Sigma), or PKA inhibitor H-89 (10 nm; Calbiochem/EMD) before actin staining. Zymography—11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared, and 1.5 mg/ml bovine skin gelatin was copolymerized in the gel (25Ando H. Twining S.S. Yue B.Y.J.T. Zhou X. Fini M.E. Kaiya T. Higginbotham E.J. Sugar J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 3541-3548PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the culture media were loaded and electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions. The SDS was removed, and the gel was incubated overnight in a reaction buffer. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities were visualized against the stained background. Pyrene Actin Polymerization Assay—The recombinant human myocilin was prepared as previously described (26Park B.C. Shen X. Fautsch M.P. Tibudan M. Johnson D.H. Yue B.Y.J.T. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 832-840PubMed Google Scholar). An actin polymerization assay was performed in triplicate using the actin polymerization biochemistry kit (Cytoskeleton). Briefly, G-buffer containing 9 μm pyrene-labeled actin and 0.2 mm ATP was prepared in 96-well plates. The reaction was started by adding a mixture of actin polymerization buffer and 30, 90, 300, or 900 nm or 9 μm myocilin to the wells. Bovine serum albumin (30 and 300 nm) was used as another control. Fluorescence change was measured at 1-min intervals using excitation of 340 nm and emission of 405 nm in a GENios Pro microplate reader (Tecan). Three independent experiments were performed. Pull-down Assays for Active RhoA—Pull-down assays (Rho activation kit; Cytoskeleton) were performed to determine the GTP-bound Rho (27Vouret-Craviari V. Bourcier C. Boulter E. van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2474-2484Google Scholar) using a glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin fusion protein containing the Rho binding domain as an affinity agent. pTarget mock- and pTarget-myocilin-transfected cells serum-starved for 18 h were lysed. The lysates were mixed at 4 °C with glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin (28Ren, X. D., Kiosses, W. B., and Schwartz, M. A. (1999)18, 578-585Google Scholar) bound to Sepharose beads for 1 h. Proteins bound to the beads were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell lysates pre-incubated with GTPγS and GDP served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Prior to incubation with the beads, aliquots were removed from samples for total RhoA. Amounts of active GTP-RhoA that binds to glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin were normalized against amounts of total RhoA in the cell lysates, and the myocilin transfectant data (mean ± S.E.) were compared with controls. In some experiments, normal human TM cells were treated with forskolin (10 μm overnight) before the pull-down assay was performed. cAMP and PKA Assays—The cAMP levels were measured using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Promega) (29Forster M.L. Sivick K. Park Y. Arva P. Lencer W.I. Tsai B. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TM cell lysates were assayed in triplicate, and the optical density was calculated against the standard curve to determine the cAMP level. Results from pTarget-myocilin transfectants were expressed as ratios (mean ± S.E.) relative to those of mock controls. The cAMP response was verified by treatment with forskolin. Equal protein aliquots of lysates from TM cells transfected with pEGFP-N1, pTarget, pTarget-myocilin, and/or pMyocilin-EGFP without or with ca V14 or dn V12 RhoA were assayed for PKA activity (30Darmond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The activity was assessed by the incorporation of phosphate in Leu-Arg-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly peptide using the nonradioactive Peptag system (Promega). Negative and positive controls were included, and the PKA activity was determined by densitometric analyses. The myocilin construct pTarget-myocilin or pMyocilin-EGFP was introduced into human TM cells. After transfection, the levels of myocilin protein, as judged by Western blotting, as well as the transcript, as judged by relative quantitative RT-PCR, in myocilin transfectants were ∼10-20-fold higher than those in mock controls (data not shown). In agreement with results from our previous studies (17Wentz-Hunter K. Shen X. Okazaki K. Tanihara H. Yue B.Y.J.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Sakai H. Park B.C. Shen X. Yue B.Y.J.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the pMyocilin-EGFP-transfected green cells showed a marked loss of actin stress fibers (Fig. 1A) and vinculin-positive focal adhesions (Fig. 1B) compared with pEGFP-N1- and pOptineurin-EGFP-transfected controls as well as nontransfected cells. When present together in mixed cultures with pMyocilin-EGFP-transfected TM cells (in green), the pDsRed-Monomer-C1-empty vector-transfected ones (in red) still displayed robust actin stress fibers although the actin dissolution was evident in the myocilin transfectants (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, the actin in the nontransfected cells in the mixed cultures remained intact.FIGURE 2Actin staining in mixed cultures of pMyocilin-EGFP- and pDsRed-Monomer-C1-transfected cells. F-actin was stained with Alexa Fluor 350-phalloidin in blue. The actin cytoskeleton is shown in black and white in the right panel. The pMyocilin-EGFP-transfected cell (in green) showed a loss of actin stress fibers, whereas the DsRed-expressing (in red) and nontransfected cells had robust actin fibers.

Res. 1996; 37: 104-113PubMed Google Scholar), to fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen types I and IV. After myocilin transfection, the ability of TM cells to adhere to these matrix proteins was significantly (p < 0.0064, n = 3) reduced (Fig. 3). To further examine the cell-matrix cohesiveness, TM cells were subjected to trypsin sensitivity tests. It was found that TM cells, upon myocilin transfection, became more sensitive to trypsinization. The trypsinization time needed to suspend cells from plates (Fig. 4A) was significantly (p < 0.0001) shorter for myocilin transfectants (92 ± 10.6 s, n = 30) than that for mock controls (144.7 ± 20.8 s, n = 30) or optineurin transfectants (136.5 ± 22.7 s, n = 34). Phase-contrast micrographs showed that compared with controls, the myocilin-transfected cultures had a greater number of cells rounding up and fewer cells remaining after treatment with trypsin for 120 s (Fig. 4B). Experiments using time lapse video microscopy in addition demonstrated that the myocilin-GFP-expressing cells, but not optineurin transfectants, rounded up sooner during trypsinization than the GFP control, indicating again increased trypsin sensitivity (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4Myocilin-transfected cells displayed a heightened sensitivity to trypsinization.A, the trypsinization time needed for pEGFP-N1 (GFP)-, pMyocilin-EGFP (Myoc-GFP)-, and pOptineurin-EGFP (OPTN-GFP)-transfected TM cells to become refractile. *, the trypsinization time for myocilin transfectants was significantly (p < 0.0001, n = 30) lower than that of GFP or optineurin controls.

Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By immunofluorescence, the fibronectin deposition was seen diminished in pTarget-myocilin-transfected cultures (Fig. 5A). Cell density was similar in the control and myocilin-transfected specimens, and thus the decreased matrix assembly was not related to reduction in cell number. When treated with LPA, a Rho stimulator, the fibronectin (Fig. 5A) deposition in myocilin transfectants was enhanced. The matrix deposition appeared to be restored by the LPA treatment. Western blotting detected a major 220 kDa band, immunoreactive to anti-fibronectin, in the media of both mock- and pTarget-myocilin-transfected cultures. The level of the secreted fibronectin in the latter was only about one-third of that in the former (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the protein data, the relative level of fibronectin transcript, determined by relative quantitative RT-PCR, was also reduced by ∼70% in myocilin transfectants (Fig. 5C). The zymographic pattern of TM cultures (Fig. 5D) was similar to that reported by Alexander et al. (31Sakai H. Park B.C. Shen X. Yue B.Y.J.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A major gelatinase band with a 66-kDa molecular mass, identified previously as gelatinase A (33Alexander J.P. Samples J.R. van Buskirk E.M. Acott T.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Res. 1991; 32: 172-180PubMed Google Scholar), was observed. Minor bands with higher and lower molecular masses might correspond to gelatinase B and the activated forms of gelatinase A, respectively. Overall, the MMP activities in myocilin transfectants were comparable with those in mock controls (Fig. 4D). An in vitro actin polymerization assay was performed to determine whether the biologically active recombinant myocilin (26Park B.C. Shen X. Fautsch M.P. Tibudan M. Johnson D.H. Yue B.Y.J.T. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 832-840PubMed Google Scholar) expressed in a ba"
https://openalex.org/W1999121105,"Thermal stress might lead to protein aggregation in the cell. Reactivation of protein aggregates depends on Hsp100 and Hsp70 chaperones. We focus in this study on the ability of DnaK, the bacterial representative of the Hsp70 family, to interact with different aggregated model substrates. Our data indicate that DnaK binding to large protein aggregates is mediated by DnaJ, and therefore it depends on its affinity for the cochaperone. Mutations in the structural region of DnaK known as the “latch” decrease the affinity of the chaperone for DnaJ, resulting in a defective activity as protein aggregate-removing agent. As expected, the chaperone activity is recovered when DnaJ concentration is raised to overcome the lower affinity of the mutant for the cochaperone, suggesting that a minimum number of aggregate-bound DnaK molecules is necessary for its efficient reactivation. Our results provide the first experimental evidence of DnaJ-mediated recruiting of ATP-DnaK molecules to the aggregate surface. Thermal stress might lead to protein aggregation in the cell.

Members of the Hsp70 protein family are involved in numerous cellular processes that include protein folding and refolding (1Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.

A. 1988; 85: 6632-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To fulfill its functional role in protein (re)folding, the Hsp70 protein has to collaborate with co-chaperones that modulate its ATPase cycle and might also carry protein substrates (5Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). DnaK is the bacterial representative of the Hsp70 family and, in collaboration with GrpE (nucleotide exchange factor) and DnaJ (Hsp40), prevents protein aggregation and productively solubilizes protein aggregates either alone or together with ClpB (the Hsp100 representative in Escherichia coli) (6Weibezahn J. Schlieker C. Tessarz P. Mogk A. Bukau B. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DnaJ is involved in the transfer of substrates to DnaK (7Han W. Christen P. J.

Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). These DnaJ roles have been found essential for almost all chaperone activities of Hsp70 proteins (12Laufen T. Zuber U. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Proteins: Structure, Function, and Mode of Action. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 241-274Google Scholar, 13Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R305-R308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The mechanism of Hsp100/Hsp70-dependent disaggregation of aggregated substrates is as yet poorly understood. The chaperone network that leads to productive aggregate reactivation depends on aggregate properties, which would include size, conformational properties of the denatured protein molecules, and number and nature of the intermolecular interactions between unfolded polypeptides. Several findings suggest that the activity of DnaK is required in the early stages of protein disaggregation to extract polypeptides from aggregates (14Zietkiewicz S. Lewandowska A. Stocki P. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7022-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have identified the interaction of DnaK with aggregated proteins as the rate-limiting step of the disaggregation process (15Zietkiewicz S. Krewska J. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44376-44383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ClpB variant BAP has also revealed that DnaK is required for the initial substrate unfolding event that leads to aggregate processing (16Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cell. 2004; 119: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The DnaK system might also be involved downstream of ClpB action, taking over the protein once it has been processed by ClpB, preventing its reassociation with the aggregate and therefore promoting substrate reactivation (16Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cell. 2004; 119: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).To understand the role of the DnaK system (K/J/E) at the initial stage of reactivation, it is necessary to study how the components of this system interact with client proteins and particularly with protein aggregates. It seems clear that the chaperone action is driven by ATP hydrolysis, which converts the ATP-bound, low affinity state into the ADP-bound high affinity state for substrate proteins (9Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 17Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6643-6649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This conversion is stimulated by DnaJ, which itself is also able to bind (partially) denatured proteins, avoiding their aggregation (10Gamer J. Multhaup G. Tomoyasu T. McCarty J.S. Rudiger S.

Refolding of denatured proteins required both domains of DnaJ: the J domain, which stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK (17Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it was proposed that after the initial binding of the substrates to DnaJ, they were transferred to the peptide-binding site of DnaK (9Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar), which was also proposed to be activated by DnaJ for binding client proteins (22Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 25Wawryznow A. Banecki B. Wall D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19307-19311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). More recently, a model has been put forward in which binding of DnaJ and ATP-DnaK to the same polypeptide chain leads to formation of ternary complexes. In these complexes, DnaJ, through a proximity effect, efficiently triggers the conversion of ATP-bound DnaK into the high affinity state that locks onto the substrate (7Han W. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19038-19043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Han W. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the question of how the components of the DnaK system interact with and assist in the reactivation of protein aggregates is not yet fully answered.To address this question, we explore in this work the association of DnaK and DnaJ with aggregates of different client proteins and find that the co-chaperone mediates DnaK binding to the aggregate. DnaK is unable by its own to significantly bind to the aggregate surface, a “catalytically” productive chaperone concentration on the aggregate surface being only achieved in the presence of DnaJ. In contrast, the co-chaperone binds the aggregate in a concentration-dependent manner, the association not requiring additional protein factors to occur. The use of a DnaK mutant in which specific ionic contacts at the substrate binding domain (SBD) 7The abbreviations used are: SBDsubstrate binding domainDnaK2ADnaK(D540A/K548A)SPRsurface plasmon resonanceDTTdithiothreitolMDHmalate dehydrogenaseG6PDHglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenaseWTwild typeSPRsurface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. 7The abbreviations used are: SBDsubstrate binding domainDnaK2ADnaK(D540A/K548A)SPRsurface plasmon resonanceDTTdithiothreitolMDHmalate dehydrogenaseG6PDHglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenaseWTwild typeSPRsurface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.

This mutant holds two substitutions (D450A/K548A) at the “latch” and shows a reduced affinity for DnaJ. As a consequence, it is recruited less efficiently by the aggregate-DnaJ complex, which in turn compromises its aggregate reactivation ability. Taken together, our data indicate that DnaK binding to protein aggregates, and therefore their reactivation, depends on DnaJ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Mutant DnaK2A was generated as previously described (26Fernandez-Saiz V. Moro F. Arizmendi J.M. Acebron S.P. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7479-7488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Wild type DnaK and the mutant were produced, purified, and extensively dialyzed to obtain nucleotide-free samples (27Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).DnaJ and GrpE were expressed in BL21 cells and purified as described earlier (28Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Geosgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mehl A.F. Heskett L.D. Neal K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ClpB was obtained as previously reported (30Woos K.M. Rims K. Goldberg A.L. Has D.B. Chungs C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the colorimetric Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPR) Binding Assays—SPR measurements were performed on a BIACORE 3000 system (BIACORE, Uppsala, Sweden). Neutravidin was coupled to Research grade CM5 sensor chips using the EDC/NHS cross-linking reagent (Amersham Biosciences). DnaJ was biotinylated (NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce) and coupled to the chips to ∼2200 resonance units. Excess neutravidin was blocked with ethanolamine. For binding studies, 40 μl of DnaK or the mutant (0.75–6 μm) was incubated with a 10-fold higher ATP concentration in 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6. Protein solution was injected at 30 °C in the above buffer over the chips at a flow rate of 20 μl min–1. Complete regeneration of the chip surfaces was achieved by two 10-μl injections of 1 m urea at a flow rate of 5 μl min–1 as described (31Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This treatment did not affect the interaction between immobilized DnaJ and DnaK or DmaK2A, as verified for each experimental series where a DnaK wild-type control was run at the beginning and the end of the series to rule out any possible inactivation of immobilized DnaJ. In all cases studied here, these controls were virtually identical. Background binding to neutravidin was subtracted from each signal to account for nonspecific binding.ATPase Activity—Steady-state ATPase activity was performed in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 11 mm magnesium acetate buffer at 30 °C, as described previously (32Moro F. Fernandez V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DnaK or DnaK2A and ATP concentrations were 3 μm and 1 mm, respectively, and DnaJ was added at varying concentrations. Reactions were followed measuring the absorbance decay at 340 nm for 30 min in a Cary spectrophotometer (Varian).Refolding of Client Proteins—Luciferase (2.5 μm; Promega) was denatured for 45 min at 25 °C, in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 10 mm DTT. Luciferase was diluted to 80 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 55 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mg·ml–1 bovine serum albumin, pH 7.7, containing an ATP-regenerating system (4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 20 ng·ml–1 pyruvate kinase). The diluted sample was incubated 10 min, and afterward 1 μm DnaK or DnaK2A, 0.5 μm GrpE, and different DnaJ concentrations (0.1–10 μm) were added. Reactivation was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP. Luciferase activity was measured after a 90-min reactivation period at 25 °C, using the luciferase assay system (Promega E1500) in a Sinergy HT (Biotek) luminometer.Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH)—MDH (2 μm monomer; Sigma) was denatured and aggregated by incubating the protein for 30 min at 47 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The sample was diluted (final MDH concentration 1 μm) in the presence of 1 μm DnaK or DnaK2A, 1.5 μm ClpB, 0.25 μm GrpE, and 0.05–10 μm DnaJ in the above buffer. Reactivation was started by the addition of 2 mm ATP and was measured at 30 °C in a medium containing the above ATP-regenerating system. MDH activity was recorded after 2 h of reactivation as previously described (33Schlieker C. Tews I. Bukau B. Mogk A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Turbidity of luciferase and MDH aggregates was recorded under the same experimental conditions used in the refolding assays, on a SLM8100 spectrofluorimeter (Aminco) with both excitation and emission wavelengths set at 550 nm.Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH)—G6PDH (2.5 μm; Sigma) was incubated for 15 min at 52 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, pH 7.5, to denature and aggregate the protein. The sample was then diluted (final protein concentration 1 μm) in the same buffer containing 6.4 μm DnaK, 0.25 μm GrpE, 0.05–10 μm DnaJ. Reactivation was measured at 25 °C in the presence of the ATP-regenerating system, as previously described (34Ben-Zvi A. De Los Rios P. Dietler G. Goloubinoff P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37298-37303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Chaperone Binding Assays—Association of chaperones with protein aggregates was characterized by SDS-PAGE analysis of the pellets obtained after centrifugation of the protein complexes (33Schlieker C. Tews I. Bukau B. Mogk A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Luciferase (80 μm) in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride was diluted 50 times the absence of chaperones and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C to allow protein aggregation. After the addition of 1 μm DnaK or DnaK2A and DnaJ (0.1–1 μm), the mixture containing 1 μm luciferase and 3 mm ATP was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in refolding buffer and centrifuged in a Beckman Optima ultracentrifuge at 95,600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. MDH was denatured as described above and mixed with 1 μm DnaK or DnaK2A, 1.5 μm ClpB, and 0.05-5 μm DnaJ. The sample was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in refolding buffer containing 3 mm ATP and centrifuged (76,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) (33Schlieker C. Tews I. Bukau B. Mogk A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The procedure used with G6PDH was the same as described above for its refolding but in the absence of GrpE. Aggregated G6PDH (1 μm), DnaK (6.4 μm), and DnaJ (0.05–10 μm) were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in refolding buffer containing 3 mm ATP. Protein complexes were centrifuged at 76,000 × g to separate aggregate-bound from free chaperones. The resulting pellets and controls, containing known amounts of native proteins, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). Commercial ADP was further purified by ion exchange chromatography to remove contaminating ATP (35Horst M. Oppliger W. Feifel B. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The amount of aggregate-bound proteins was quantitated by densitometry of the gel bands with a gel scanner G-800 and the Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. Each data point is an average of at least two experiments and was estimated by subtracting the amount of the corresponding protein in pellets of control experiments.RESULTSDnaJ Mediates DnaK Interaction with Protein Aggregates—It has been suggested that the DnaK system functions upstream of ClpB to reactivate protein aggregates. However, how the components of this system interact with protein aggregates remains as yet unknown. To address this question, the interaction of DnaK and DnaJ (the only components of the system that can bind client proteins) with aggregates of luciferase (Fig. 1A) and of MDH (Fig. 1B) has been analyzed. Experiments show that DnaK is unable on its own to significantly interact with aggregates of either protein substrates, but it binds in the presence of DnaJ and ATP. In contrast, the co-chaperone binds to the aggregates in the absence of DnaK, suggesting that the interaction of the chaperone with aggregate-bound DnaJ drives its association with protein aggregates. Since reactivation of MDH aggregates requires the combined action of the DnaK system and ClpB, we also tested whether ClpB had any influence on the way the DnaK system binds to aggregates. A similar analysis to that shown in Fig. 1B but carried out in the presence of ClpB indicates that the Hsp100 bacterial homolog does not modify the DnaJ-dependence of DnaK binding to protein aggregates (Fig. 1B). As expected for an interaction that depends on ATP to occur, DnaJ-mediated association of DnaK to protein aggregates is not observed for the ADP-bound or apo-forms of the chaperone (Fig. 1, C and D).Two factors might affect the association of chaperones with protein aggregates, namely the time the protein substrate spends under denaturing and reactivation conditions. The first one (i.e. the time at denaturing temperatures) determines both the size of the aggregate and the conformational properties of the denatured protein molecules within the aggregate. These properties have been related to the ability of different combination of chaperones to reactivate protein aggregates (36Ben Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 37Lewandowska A. Matuszewska M. Liberek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and might influence chaperone binding to the aggregate. Special care has been taken to denature and aggregate protein substrates under the same experimental conditions (protein concentration, temperature, and incubation time) to obtain samples that, after cooling or diluting them from denaturant-containing solutions, maintain homogeneous size and secondary structure (data not shown). Therefore, chaperones bind to stable protein aggregates that do not evolve with time. The second one (i.e. the effect of the incubation time on the association reaction) has been analyzed by performing binding experiments at different incubation times. The results (not shown) indicate that the system reaches a binding equilibrium within the first 10 min of incubation in the presence of ATP. It should be noted that less than 10% of the nucleotide is hydrolyzed during the initial incubation at 25 °C and subsequent centrifugation at 4 °C. Long incubation times might change the equilibrium as the amount of ATP hydrolyzed increases.If the above finding holds for DnaK and DnaJ binding to different protein aggregates, the amount of aggregate-bound chaperone should be sensitive to co-chaperone concentration. To test this hypothesis, binding experiments at constant DnaK and protein aggregate concentrations and increasing DnaJ amounts were carried out. When this type of experiments is performed with aggregates of MDH (Fig. 2) and of G6PDH (Fig. 3), the amount of aggregate-bound DnaK increases with DnaJ concentration, indicating that the cochaperone binds to the aggregate surface in a concentration-dependent manner and that association of DnaK depends on previous DnaJ binding. If DnaK could bind aggregates by itself, a constant aggregate-bound chaperone concentration should be observed, and this is clearly not the case. Data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 also reveal that: (i) the concentration of aggregate-associated DnaK increases exponentially with co-chaperone concentration up to 1 μm DnaJ and slightly decreases at higher co-chaperone concentrations (Figs. 2B and 3B); (ii) in contrast to DnaK and DnaJ, the interaction of ClpB with MDH aggregates is not sensitive to co-chaperone concentration (Fig. 2B); and (iii) the reactivation yield of both client proteins shows the same DnaJ concentration dependence observed for DnaK binding to their aggregates (Figs. 2C and 3C). These data indicate that DnaK binds to the client protein aggregate once the cochaperone is bound at the aggregate surface.FIGURE 2Interaction of chaperones with MDH aggregates. A, SDS-PAGE (12.5%) analysis of the aggregate-associated chaperones. DnaK (1 μm), ClpB (1.5 μm), and aggregated MDH (1 μm) were incubated with varying amounts of DnaJ (0.05–5 μm) in the presence of 3 mm ATP and centrifuged as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting pellets were analyzed by electrophoresis. The lane marked with an asterisk contains 20% (DnaK), 100% (DnaJ; 1 μm), 10% (ClpB), and 50% (MDH) of the initially added protein.

If DnaK would interact only with DnaJ at the aggregate surface, this value could not be higher than 1, in contrast to what is experimentally observed. This suggests that during the functional cycle, DnaK molecules bound to the DnaJ-aggregate complex are transferred to the aggregate. The comparison of the reactivation yields and the estimated aggregate-bound DnaK/DnaJ molar ratios also indicates that the values that provide the highest reactivation yields are between 3 and 1 for MDH and between 4 and 2 for G6PDH. It should be noted that the percentage of aggregate-bound DnaK is at most 24 and 16% of the initially added protein for MDH and G6PDH, respectively.A DnaK Mutant with Impaired Affinity for DnaJ Shows Defective Binding to Protein Aggregates and Reactivation Yields—To further demonstrate that the ability of DnaK to interact with and reactivate protein aggregates depends on DnaJ, the association of WT DnaK and DnaK2A (Fig. 4A) with DnaJ and protein aggregates has been characterized. This DnaK mutant has two amino acid replacements (D540A and K548A) located in the “latch” region that have a small effect on (i) protein conformation, (ii) peptide association kinetics, (iii) protein and peptide-protein thermal stability, and (iv) interdomain communication. However, DnaK2A was unable to refold luciferase (26Fernandez-Saiz V. Moro F. Arizmendi J.M. Acebron S.P. Muga A. J. Biol.

Selective inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1 results in preferential decrease in prostacyclin production over thromboxane A2 production, thus leading to less gastric effects than those seen with nonselective COX inhibitors such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Here we show a novel effect of celecoxib via a mechanism that is independent of COX-2 inhibition. The drug inhibited the delayed rectifier (Kv2) potassium channels from Drosophila, rats, and humans and led to pronounced arrhythmia in Drosophila heart and arrhythmic beating of rat heart cells in culture. These effects occurred despite the genomic absence of cyclooxygenases in Drosophila and the failure of acetylsalicylic acid, a potent inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2, to inhibit rat Kv2.1 channels. A genetically null mutant of Drosophila Shab (Kv2) channels reproduced the cardiac effect of celecoxib, and the drug was unable to further enhance the effect of the mutation. These observations reveal an unanticipated effect of celecoxib on Drosophila hearts and on heart cells from rats, implicating the inhibition of Kv2 channels as the mechanism underlying this effect.

Gastric effects of nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), arise in main part from inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1. A selective inhibition of COX-2 by coxibs helps avoid these effects (3Bombardier C. Laine L. Reicin A. Shapiro D. Burgos-Vargas R. Davis B. Day R. Ferraz M.B. Hawkey C.J. Hochberg M.C. Kvien T.K.

These effects of coxibs have been attributed to a reduction in antithrombotic, COX-2-derived prostacyclin without a reduction in prothrombotic, COX-1-derived platelet thromboxane. This shifts the balance toward a prothrombotic state resulting in clot formation (7Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Nat. Rev.

The adverse effects of drugs like celecoxib arising from their selective inhibition of COX-2 is currently the topic of intense discussion (7Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Nat. Rev.

We now show that celecoxib can have additional, heretofore unanticipated effects on Drosophila hearts and rat heart cells via a pathway independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. At low micromolar concentrations, celecoxib reduced heart rate and induced pronounced arrhythmia in Drosophila hearts. A similar effect was observed in rat cardiomyocytes in culture in which the drug reduced the beating rate in clusters of cells and made the beating arrhythmic. These effects were not mediated via cyclooxygenase inhibition but involved inhibition of the voltage-activated delayed rectifier K+ channels (Kv2) by the drug. These observations reveal a new molecular mechanism underlying the effects of celecoxib that may operate in addition to its prothrombotic influence. The data also raise the possibility of effects on other tissues that express Kv2 channels. Materials—Quinidine, 4-aminopyridine acetylsalicylic acid, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Celebrex capsules were used as the source of celecoxib so as to examine the effect of the actual formulation used in clinical settings (9Davies N.M. McLachlan A.J. Day R.O. Williams K.M. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2000; 38: 225-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Celecoxib (4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide) from Celebrex capsules containing 200 mg of the drug was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Additional details are given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Drosophila Heart Preparation—Strains of Drosophila melanogaster were maintained at 21 °C. Activity of the heart was monitored at 21 °C using a larval preparation described previously (10Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Heart rate (HR) was counted for 6 min before drug application (the basal rate), for 10 min in the presence of the drug, and for 10 min after washing out the drug. Video recordings of heart activity were made at a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels at 30 frames/s. Analysis of video data is described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Rat Ventricular Cardiomyocytes—Rat fetuses (stage G20, 1 day before birth) from timed-pregnant Holtzman rats were kindly donated by Dr. J. Olson. The protocols used were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the State University of New York at Buffalo. Ventricular myocytes were isolated and cultured under aseptic conditions. The cardiomyocyte cultures were used in experiments 24–48 h after seeding the cells when cells were beating rhythmically. Beating activity in cardiomyocytes was monitored at 37 °C. The activity was video-recorded for 2 min each before drug application (basal rate), at the end of 45-min exposure to the drug, and 15 min after wash-out. Additional details and analysis of video data are given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Recordings from Drosophila K+ Channels—Delayed rectifier K+ current (IKS) and the fast transient K+ current (IA) were recorded from the larval body wall muscles using two-microelectrode voltage clamping. Recordings were made from muscle fiber 12 (11Bate M. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 791-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currents were elicited by 500-ms voltage steps from a holding potential of -80 mV. IKS was measured as current at the end of the 500-ms testing pulse, and IA was measured as the initial peak current. A dose-response curve for IKS (see Fig. 4E) was generated by examining the current for voltage steps to +40 mV. For more detailed current voltage relationships (see Fig. 4, A and C), membrane potential was stepped to between -40 and +40 mV in 10-mV increments. The currents were divided by cell capacitance to obtain current densities.

After establishing the whole-cell configuration, the cell was held at -70 mV, and 500-ms test pulses were applied in 10-mV increments to potentials up to +40 mV. Drugs were applied using a fast perfusion system (ValveLink 8, AutoMate Scientific). Recordings from rat Kv2.1 channels were made in flow of a drug solution within 10 s from the start of perfusion. A clone for human Kv2.1 channels in pTracerSV40 vector was provided by Dr. T. Zimmer of Friedrich Schiller University (Jena, Germany) (14Scholle A. Dugarmaa S. Zimmer T. Leonhardt M. Koopmann R. Engeland B. Pongs O. Benndorf K. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 198: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells expressing the channels were held at -80 mV, and 500-ms test pulses were applied in 10-mV increments. Recordings in the presence of the drug were made 5 min after the start of drug perfusion. The experiments were performed at 21–23 °C. Kv2.1 current was measured at the end of 500-ms test pulses as mentioned above in the case of IKS. The currents obtained in the presence of the drug were normalized to the currents obtained before the drug exposure. For more details, see supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” We examined whether celecoxib affected cardiac rhythm in Drosophila hearts and rat cardiomyocytes. We examined this first in Drosophila, as Drosophila serves as an important model for human cardiac pharmacology and cardiomyopathies (10Gu G.G. Singh S. J.

Genetics. 2007; 176: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Heart rate in Drosophila was significantly reduced by exposure to 3 μm celecoxib (Fig. 1, A and B). The heart stopped beating within a minute of applying 30 μm and within seconds of exposure to 100 μm celecoxib. The dose-response curve showed an EC50 (50% reduction in HR) of 11.2 μm (Fig. 1C). Me2SO, used for dissolving the drug, did not affect HR at 0.5%, the highest concentration used in these experiments (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition to decreasing HR, celecoxib affected cardiac rhythm. Each trace in Fig. 2A shows HR from one animal as it varied over time with drug application. Although HR fluctuations in a pool of samples averaged out (Fig. 1A), they were observed in individual animals even at low concentrations (Fig. 2A). Although 1 μm celecoxib did not affect rhythm in all cases (Fig. 2B), it induced intermittent arrhythmia in 5 of 17 cases (Fig. 2C). Similarly, 3 μm celecoxib induced pronounced intermittent arrhythmia (Fig. 2, A and D) with several minutes of arrhythmic activity followed by several minutes of relatively regular heartbeat. Arrhythmia became so severe at 10 μm that in 4 of 16 animals, heartbeat was occasionally punctuated by temporary heart stoppages (Fig. 2E). Irregularity of HR was quantified for beat-to-beat interval and for amplitude of the movement of the heart wall. The coefficient of variation, a dimensionless ratio of standard deviation to mean, was used as a measure of variability in the rhythm and the amplitude (supplemental Fig. 1). Celecoxib significantly increased variability in interbeat intervals as well as in amplitudes of contractions (Fig. 2F). To examine the effect of celecoxib on mammalian heart, we used cultured cardiomyocytes from rat fetuses at stage G20 (1 day before birth). These cells can establish a spontaneous beating rhythm in culture and provide a model for cardiac function in humans (21O-Uchi J. Komukai K. Kusakari Y. Obata T. Hongo K. Sasaki H. Kurihara S. Proc.

Circulation. 2003; 107: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Celecoxib reduced the rate of beating in cardiomyocytes with significant effect occurring at 3 μm and with an EC50 of 7.7 μm (Fig. 3). This compares with an EC50 of 11.2 μm for HR decrease in Drosophila. The drug also induced irregularity in the beat. As in the case of Drosophila, this irregularity was more marked in individual samples (Fig. 3B) and was averaged out in a pool of samples (Fig. 3A). Celecoxib significantly increased the coefficient of variation in rhythmicity (Fig. 3D). Thus celecoxib affected rat cardiomyocytes and Drosophila heart in a similar way. Although the prothrombotic effects of coxibs have been attributed to selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, there is no report on the presence of cyclooxygenases in Drosophila. We probed the existence of relevant sequences in the genomic and the proteomic data bases of Drosophila. COX is composed of three units: an epithelial growth factor-like domain, a membrane-binding motif, and a domain with two catalytic sites, one for cyclooxygenase activity and one for hydroperoxidase reaction (26Kurumbail R.G.

Nucleotide-nucleotide, protein-nucleotide, and protein-protein BLASTs in D. melanogaster data bases using human COX-2 sequence elicited some similarity with genes and proteins characterized by peroxidase activity or an epithelial growth factor-like domain but did not yield a similarity with respect to COX-2 activity. Amino acids 510–535 of the COX-1 and COX-2 sequences, constituting the cyclooxygenase active site, are highly conserved among species (supplemental Table 1) (27Kozak K.R. Prusakiewicz J.J. Rowlinson S.W. Schneider C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30072-30077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, BLAST searches using human active site sequences found no similarity in Drosophila. Also, Ser-530, a residue irreversibly acetylated by acetylsalicylic acid, and the surrounding amino acids are virtually identical in all species for both isoforms of COX (27Kozak K.R.

Thus the effects reported above in Drosophila may not occur via inhibition of COX-2. Because K+ channels play a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the cardiac rhythm (29Roberts R. Nat.

IKS elicited at +40 mV (Fig. 4D) showed an effect in a similar concentration range as the effect on heartbeat. Celecoxib inhibited IKS with IC50 of 10.3 μm with significant inhibition starting at 1 μm (Fig. 4E). This compares with an EC50 of 11.2 μm for reduction in HR. Furthermore, IKS showed very little inactivation in the absence of the drug, but celecoxib increased the rate of inactivation significantly (Fig. 4D). Celecoxib did not inhibit the remaining two voltage-activated K+ currents in the muscles: IA, carried by the Shaker channels (37Wu C.-F. Ganetzky B. Lunt G.G. Neurotox'88: Molecular Basis of Drug and Pesticide Action. Elsevier, Amsterdam1988: 311-323Google Scholar, 38Wu C.F. Ganetzky B. Haugland F.N. Liu A.X.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6838-6843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The drug did not inhibit IA at 20 μm (Fig. 4, B and C), a concentration 20-fold higher than the concentration that significantly affected IKS (Fig. 4E) and cardiac rhythm (Fig. 2F). Similarly, celecoxib did not inhibit IKF at 20 μm (data not shown). Mammalian Kv2.1 channels are ortholog of Drosophila Shab (Kv2) channels and play a significant role in cardiac function (40Herrera V.L. Ruiz-Opazo N. Curr. Opin.

We examined the effect of celecoxib on rat Kv2.1 channels expressed in HEK-293 cells (12Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17532-17538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Celecoxib inhibited Kv2.1 current in a similar range of concentrations as in the case of IKS (Fig. 5, A and D). An IC50 of 10.3 μm for Kv2.1 (Fig. 5D) compares with an IC50 of 10.3 μm for Drosophila IKS and an EC50 of 7.7 μm for reduction of rate of beating in cardiomyocytes. As in the case of IKS, celecoxib made inactivation faster for rat Kv2.1 channels (Fig. 5C). The current started recovering from the effect of low drug concentrations within a minute, and it showed less recovery during this time frame with increasing concentrations of the drug (Fig. 5E). To confirm whether inhibition of rat Kv2.1 current occurred independent of COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib, we used acetylsalicylic acid, which inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. The current was not reduced by 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid (Fig. 5B), a concentration that is more than 400-fold higher than the IC50 of 2.4 μm for COX-2 inhibition by acetylsalicylic acid (46Chen Q.H. Rao P.N. Knaus E.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 2459-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus inhibition of COX-2 could not be mediating the effect of celecoxib on rat Kv2.1 channels. To further examine the link between the effect of celecoxib on channels and its effect on heartbeat, we used Drosophila, with which we could combine the strength of pharmacology with that of available genetic tools. Quinidine blocks Drosophila Shab channels in a highly selective manner (47Singh S. Wu C.-F. Budnik V. Gramates S. Neuromuscular Junctions in Drosophila. Academic Press, New York1999: 191-220Google Scholar, 48Kraliz D. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 49Kraliz D. Bhattacharya A. Singh S. J. Neurogenet. 1998; 12: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). If celecoxib induced arrhythmia by inhibiting these channels, then quinidine also would induce arrhythmia. Previous studies have shown reduction of HR in Drosophila by quinidine without examining its effect on the rhythm (10Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In these previous studies, quinidine reduced HR with an EC50 of 79 μm. In the current experiments, 50 μm quinidine induced severe irregularity in heartbeat (Fig. 6, A and B), again implicating Shab channels in this phenomenon. Although quinidine shows high selectivity for Shab channels in Drosophila (47Singh S. Wu C.-F. Budnik V. Gramates S. Neuromuscular Junctions in Drosophila. Academic Press, New York1999: 191-220Google Scholar), its effect on other channels cannot be completely ruled out. A genetic approach using a mutation in the Shab gene was pursued to corroborate further the link between Shab channel disruption and arrhythmia. The Shab3 mutation is predicted to eliminate the Shab channels (36Hegde P. Gu G.G. Chen D. Free S.J. Singh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22109-22113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heartbeat in Shab3 larvae showed a severe effect with full contractions of the heart interspersed between partial contractile events similar to fibrillation-type activity. In addition, the rate and pattern of contractions varied from larva to larva as well as at different times within the same larva. Fig. 6A shows two such recordings from Shab3 mutants. Although HR in terms of full contractions appeared to be substantially reduced in Shab3 (Fig. 6A), it was difficult to quantify HR because of many partial contractions with different amplitudes. Variability in heart rhythm in Shab3 was compared with that in the wild type. As shown in Fig. 6B, Shab3 animals exhibited a strongly arrhythmic heartbeat. If Shab channels are involved in mediating the action of celecoxib on cardiac rhythm, then the drug may not be able to further augment the effect of the Shab3 mutation as the mutation has already disrupted these channels. 10 μm celecoxib, which itself produced significant arrhythmia, was unable to augment further the arrhythmic effect of the mutation (Fig. 6C). This strongly supports the idea that the arrhythmic effect of celecoxib occurred at least in major part via the Shab channels. As a preliminary step toward exploring the relevance to humans of the above observations, we examined whether celecoxib had any effect on human Kv2.1 channels. There is a strong overlap among Drosophila Shab, rat Kv2.1, and human Kv2.1 channels from molecular, pharmacological, and physiological points of view. For example, rat and human Kv2.1 channels have identical amino acid sequences over the membrane-spanning region (50Ju M. Stevens L. Leadbitter E. Wray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12769-12778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 3 μm, celecoxib strongly inhibited the current through human Kv2.1 channels expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 7). In addition, as in the case of Drosophila Shab and rat Kv2.1 channels, the drug increased the rate of inactivation in human Kv2.1 channels. Until now, the adverse effects of celecoxib have been attributed to a single mechanism-reduction in COX-2-derived prostacyclin but not in COX-1-derived platelet thromboxane resulting in clot formation in response to a perturbation (Fig. 8) (51Cheng Y. Austin S.C. Rocca B. Koller B.H. Coffman T.M. Grosser T. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Science. 2002; 296: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 52Fitzgerald G.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 1709-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 53James M.J. Cleland L.G. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2006; 9: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The data presented here reveal an important new effect of celecoxib. At low micromolar concentrations, the drug reduced heart rate in Drosophila and induced pronounced arrhythmia. In a similar fashion, it reduced the rate of beating in rat heart cells in culture and made the beating arrhythmic. The above effects were mediated via an unanticipated mechanism, i.e. through inhibition of delayed rectifier potassium channels (Fig. 8) rather than through inhibition of cyclooxygenases as Drosophila lacks these enzymes. The failure of acetylsalicylic acid to inhibit rat Kv2.1 channels supports the COX-independence of the channel inhibition by celecoxib. The role of the channels in mediating the cardiac effect in Drosophila was further substantiated by the induction of the effect by a mutation in the Shab channels and by the inability of the drug to further influence this effect. Inhibition of human Kv2.1 channels by celecoxib, expression of Kv2.1 channels in human atrial and ventricular cells (41Ordog B. Brutyo E. Puskas L.G. Papp J.G. Varro A. Szabad J. Boldogkoi Z. Int. J. Cardiol. 2006; 111: 386-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 54Gaborit N. Le Bouter S. Szuts V. Varro A. Escande D. Nattel S. Demolombe S. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 675-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and the fact that dysfunction of delayed rectifier K+ (Kv2.1 and Kv1.5) channels can induce cardiac arrhythmias and reduction in HR in mammals (55Xu H. Barry D.M. Li H. Brunet S. Guo W. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) make it tempting to speculate on the likely cardiac implications of celecoxib therapy in humans. In addition, Kv2.1 channels play an important physiological role in several tissues such as pancreas, pulmonary arteries, placental vasculature, and hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons (56Catterall W.A. Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. The IUPHAR Compendium of Voltage-gated Ion Channels. International Union of Pharmacology, Leeds, UK2002: 86-88Google Scholar, 57Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 58Park K.S. Mohapatra D.P. Misonou H. Trimmer J.S. Science. 2006; 313: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). An effect of celecoxib on Kv2.1 channels in these tissues could likely have an impact on the functioning of the tissues. However, any speculation on likely human implications of the observations reported here would be premature. The extent to which human cardiac and other functions may be altered cannot be gauged at this stage because of likely differences among Drosophila, rats, and humans in profiles of expression of various ion channels and accessory subunits and in the role of these channels in action potentials and contractility. In addition, any effect in a particular tissue will depend on the concentration of the drug in that tissue. Celecoxib concentration that shows significant Kv2.1 inhibition (1 μm) is in the range of plasma concentration achieved at therapeutic dosages in humans. For example, the peak drug concentration in human plasma after the minimal adult therapeutic dose of 200 mg is generally between 1.7 and 2.8 μm and may be as high as 6.2 μm in women aged 65 or older (9Davies N.M. McLachlan A.J. Day R.O. Williams K.M. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2000; 38: 225-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, available drug concentration in specific tissues is not known, and drug binding to plasma proteins on one hand and a large volume of distribution on the other (9Davies N.M. McLachlan A.J. Day R.O. Williams K.M. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2000; 38: 225-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) make it difficult to assess drug concentration in specific tissues. For all these reasons, the effects reported here cannot be extrapolated to human heart or other tissues without further experiments to explore directly such possibilities. The data presented here make a case for pursuing such experiments and for examining whether the mechanistic direction described here for the effects of celecoxib has physiological and clinical relevance in humans. The data presented here do not allow for an extrapolation to other selective COX-2 inhibitors because the observed effect did not depend on COX inhibition. Although the previously described cardiovascular complications arising from the prothrombotic effects of coxibs have been seen to a varying degree in the case of most coxibs, the effect described here may or may not translate to other coxibs depending on the nature of the interacting domains between the channel and the drug molecule. As a fortuitous outcome of the above observations, lack of cyclooxygenases in Drosophila makes it valuable for investigating side effects of COX-2 inhibitors and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that occur via pathways possibly independent of COX inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2004207754,"Hallmarks of neuronal differentiation are neurite sprouting, extension, and branching. We previously showed that increased expression of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase β2 (CTβ2), an isoform of a key phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthetic enzyme, accompanies neurite outgrowth (Carter, J. M., Waite, K. A., Campenot, R. B., Vance, J. E., and Vance, D. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 44988–44994). CTβ2 mRNA is highly expressed in the brain. We show that CTβ2 is abundant in axons of rat sympathetic neurons and retinal ganglion cells. We used RNA silencing to decrease CTβ2 expression in PC12 cells differentiated by nerve growth factor. In CTβ2-silenced cells, numbers of primary and secondary neurites were markedly reduced, suggesting that CTβ2 facilitates neurite outgrowth and branching. However, the length of individual neurites was significantly increased, and the total amount of neuronal membrane was unchanged. Neurite branching of PC12 cells is known to be inhibited by activation of Akt and promoted by the Akt inhibitor LY294002. Our experiments showed that LY294002 increases neurite sprouting and branching in control PC12 cells but not in CTβ2-deficient cells. CTβ2 was not phosphorylated in vitro by Akt. However, inhibition of Cdk5 by roscovitine blocked CTβ2 phosphorylation and reduced neurite outgrowth and branching. These results highlight the importance of CTβ2 in neurons for promoting neurite outgrowth and branching and represent the first identification of a lipid biosynthetic enzyme that facilitates these functions.

Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). The morphological hallmark of neuronal differentiation is neurite sprouting and elongation and subsequent maturation of neurites into axons and dendrites. These processes increase the demand for membrane components. Accordingly, the biosynthesis of the predominant membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), is accelerated during neurite outgrowth in response to NGF (2Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Three CT isoforms, encoded by two genes, have been identified in rodents. CTα is encoded by the Pcyt1a gene, whereas CTβ2 and CTβ3 are derived from the Pcyt1b gene (6Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowksi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). CTα and CTβ2 share considerable sequence identity, but CTα contains a nuclear localization signal (8Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CTβ2 does not (7Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowksi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies have found that CTα is primarily located in the nucleus and that CTβ2 resides in the cytosol and on the endoplasmic reticulum (9Ridsdale R. Tseu I. Wang J. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49148-49155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of CTβ3 has not yet been reported. Although CTα is expressed in all tissues, CTβ2 and CTβ3 mRNAs are predominantly expressed in the brain (6Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In neurons, PC is synthesized not only in cell bodies but also in distal axons (4Vance J.E. Pan D.

During neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells and Neuro2a cells, CTβ2 expression and CT activity are increased, whereas CTα expression is unchanged, indicating a link between CTβ2 expression and neurite outgrowth (3Carter J.M. Waite K.A. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44988-44994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neurites are categorized by their location relative to the cell body. Primary neurites project directly from the cell body. Secondary neurites (i.e. branches) project from primary neurites. The sprouting of primary neurites and branch formation are distinct processes that are independently regulated (13Markus A. Zhong J. Snider W.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 65-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). During neuronal differentiation, NGF activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, which activates Akt (14Jackson T. Blader I. Hammonds-Odie L. Burga C. Cooke F. Hawkins P. Wolf A. Heldman K. Theibert A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurite extension and branching are promoted in some populations of neurons by activation of Akt, whereas in other neurons activation of Akt impairs neurite elongation and branching (15Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, Akt activation inhibits neurite branching (16Higuchi M. Onishi K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that neurons require CTβ2 in axons to provide a localized source of PC for neurite outgrowth, extension, and/or branching. We show that CTβ2 is abundant in PC12 cells and in distal axons of primary cultures of neurons. RNA silencing of CTβ2 in PC12 cells reduced the number of primary neurites and markedly reduced the number of branches but increased the length of individual neurites. Moreover, stimulation of neurite branching in PC12 cells, a process that is normally induced by inhibition of Akt, was abrogated in CTβ2-deficient cells. These data provide important new insights into the role of CTβ2 and PC biosynthesis in neurite sprouting and branch formation. Cell Culture—Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in F12-K medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For differentiation and transfection experiments, cells were seeded on collagen-coated 35-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/dish. The cells were incubated overnight and then treated with medium containing 0.5% horse serum and 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), and cells were grown for up to 5 days. Compartmented Cultures of Rat Sympathetic Neurons and Retinal Ganglion Cells—Sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglia of 1-day-old rats were isolated as previously described (17Campenot R. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, following dissection, the ganglia were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated and plated into the center compartment of compartmented culture dishes. Initially, all compartments contained 2.5 S NGF (100 ng/ml). NGF was withdrawn from the center compartment (containing cell bodies and proximal axons) after 7 days. The side compartments (containing distal axons alone) contained 100 ng/ml NGF throughout the experiments. Retinal ganglion cells were isolated from 1-day-old rats and cultured in compartmented culture dishes as previously described (18Hayashi H. Campenot R.B. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14009-14015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Proximal axons/cell bodies, distal axons of sympathetic neurons, and distal axons of retinal ganglion cells were harvested from 2-week-old cultures (18Hayashi H. Campenot R.B. Vance D.E. Vance J.E.

Antibodies—Anti-M rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize CTβ2 were generated against the conserved membrane domain of rat liver CT (amino acids 256–288) and were a generous gift from Dr. R. Cornell (Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada). Anti-human CTβ2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. S. Jackowski (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The CTβ2-specific antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 347–365 of CTβ2 (7Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowksi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma, and the anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) and anti-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The Cdk5 (cylcin-dependent kinase 5) antibody was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Transfection of PC12 Cells and Measurement of Neurite Length and Branching—PC12 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish for 12 h, after which the medium was changed to F12-K medium without serum. Cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of DNA/35-mm dish. For RNA silencing, cells were co-transfected with a 3.7-kb mammalian expression vector encoding recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) (phrGFP) (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) and pSILENCER 4.0 encoding rat CTβ2. PC12 cells were transfected with equimolar amounts of phrGFP and either the silencing construct (pSiCTβ2) or pSILENCER 4.0 containing a scrambled, noncoding insert. For CTβ2 overexpression studies, cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CTβ2 (pCI[CTβ2-HA]) and phrGFP. The cells were transfected in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, pSiCTβ2, pSILENCER 4.0 containing the scrambled insert, or pCI[CTβ2-HA] and phrGFP were added in a 3:1 ratio to Lipofectamine 2000 for 20 min to allow formation of DNA complexes, which were then applied to PC12 cells. After 12 h, the cells were given serum-free F12-K medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF to promote differentiation and neurite outgrowth. After 2, 3, and 4 days, cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Cells that had been co-transfected with phr-GFP and pSiCTβ2 were identified by their fluorescence at 520 nm. Cells bearing at least one neurite longer than 20 pixels were considered to be differentiated, and all neurites and branches were counted and/or measured. At each time point, at least 20 random fields of view were sampled. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Two dishes of PC12 cells or six dishes of sympathetic neurons and retinal ganglion cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested into 1 ml of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and then supernatants were incubated for 1 h with 3 μl of anti-M antibodies on a rotating shaker at 4 °C. A 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose beads (40 μl) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose bead conjugates containing immunoprecipitated CTβ2 were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted from the Protein A-Sepharose beads using SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% SDS, and 0.04% bromphenol blue) and heated at 70 °C for 3 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and then transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, Cambridge, Canada). Ponceau S staining was used to compare protein loading in lanes of the gel. The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated overnight with anti-M (membrane domain) (dilution 1:1,000), anti-CTβ2 (dilution 1:1,000), or mouse anti-tubulin (dilution 1:1,000) antibodies. All blots were washed for 1 h and subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse, IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,500 dilution) for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was detected using Westdura or Westfemto ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Measurement of CT Activity—PC12 cells from two 35-mm dishes were collected in 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. The cells were sonicated for 20 s at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Aliquots of the supernatant were used for measurement of CT activity and immunoblot analysis. CT activity was determined in the presence of PC/oleate vesicles by monitoring the conversion of phospho-[3H]choline to CDP-[3H]choline (20Pelech S. Pritchard P. Vance D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of PC12 Cells with [3H]Choline—PC12 cells were transfected with control plasmid or phrGFP + pSiCTβ2. Six h later, the medium was changed to serum-free medium that contained 50 ng/ml NGF. After 48 h, cells were incubated with [3H]choline (5 μCi/35-mm dish) for 3 h. Cells were harvested, the amount of cellular protein was determined, and radioactivity in PC was measured. In Vivo Phosphorylation of CTβ2—PC12 cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 4 days, after which the cells were incubated for 48 h with LY294002 or for 1 h with 25 μm roscovitine or an equivalent volume of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) in the presence of 100 μm [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested into immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, after which supernatants were incubated with 3 μlof anti-M antibody on a rotating shaker at 4 °C. After 1 h, 40 μlof a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose bead conjugates containing immunoprecipitated CTβ2 were washed three times. CTβ2 was eluted from the beads by heating for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 70 °C. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. The gel was dried overnight and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) for up to 5 days. Quantification of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled CT protein was performed with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—PC12 cells were harvested into 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. CTβ2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-M antibody as described above. Tubulin was immunoprecipitated using anti-tubulin antibodies. Cdk5 was immunoprecipitated using 10 μlof anti-Cdk5 antibodies. Following immunoprecipitation, Cdk5-bound protein A-Sepharose beads were warmed at 30 °C for 10 min. CTβ2 protein was eluted from the beads with 40 μlof buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. The eluted CTβ2 protein was added to Cdk5-protein A-Sepharose beads in the presence of 1 mCi of [32P]ATP and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 3 min in the presence of 5× SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. The gels were dried overnight and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) for up to 3 days. Phospholipid Extraction and Quantification—Cell lysates were centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Phospholipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel G60 plates with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:1) as developing solvent. Phospholipids were visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine vapor and identified by comparison with phospholipid standards. The relevant spots were scraped from the plate, and amounts of phospholipids were determined by phosphorus analysis (21Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTβ2-silencing RNA Oligonucleotides—An oligonucleotide specific for CTβ2 mRNA (ACA GGT ATC CCA AAA TCCC) was designed using a sequence finder algorithm (Ambion, Austin, TX) and synthesized at the core facility (Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta). The sequence showed no homology to other sequences in the NCBI data base; nor was the siCTβ2 oligonucleotide homologous to any other mRNA listed in GenBank™. The siCTβ2 oligonucleotide was inserted into pSILENCER 4.1CMV (Ambion, Austin, TX), and the plasmid was named pSiCTβ2. Insertion of the cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. Cloning and Hemagglutinin Modification of CTβ2 cDNA—A cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame of CTβ2 was cloned from a cDNA population generated from PC12 cell mRNA using the following primers: 5′-GCCATGCCAGTAGTTACCACT-3′ (forward) and 3′-GCTAAGGTTTGTGTGGGTTGTC-5′ (reverse). The amplicon was inserted into TOPO 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and used as a template for the addition of an HA tag to the 3′-end of the open reading frame. The following sequence encoded the HA tag: 3′-TCAAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATACTTCTCATCCTCATCCCCCTCACTCAT-5′. The amplicon was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Invitrogen) and named pCI[CTβ2-HA]. Expression of CTβ2-HA protein was confirmed by immunoblotting of proteins from lysates of cells using anti-HA and anti-CTβ2 antibodies. Other Methods—Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. LY294002 and roscovitine were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. CTβ2 Is Present in Axons of Sympathetic Neurons and Retinal Ganglion Cells—In light of our previous observation that NGF increases the expression of CTβ2 in PC12 cells (3Carter J.M. Waite K.A. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44988-44994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the subcellular localization of CT isoforms within neurons might provide insight into their contributions to PC biosynthesis and neurite growth. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that PC biosynthetic enzyme activities, including CT, are present in distal axons of rat sympathetic neurons (4Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The finding that in most cell types CTα is predominantly nuclear, whereas CTβ is cytoplasmic, suggested that CTβ2, rather than CTα, is a functionally important CT isoform in axons. We therefore immunoprecipitated CT from PC12 cells, rat sympathetic neurons, and retinal ganglion cells using an antibody (anti-M) raised against the membrane domain of rat liver CT. We confirmed that CTβ2 was immunoprecipitated by the anti-M antibody by immunoblotting the immunoprecipitated proteins from retinal ganglion cells with anti-CTβ2 antibodies (Fig. 1). Based on these immunoblots, and consistent with the molecular mass of CTβ2 (43 kDa), we identified the upper band in Fig. 1 as CTβ2. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitated proteins in the absence of primary antibody identified the other major band in Fig. 1 as the IgG heavy chain of the anti-M antibody. CTβ2 was also detected in PC12 cells and rat sympathetic neurons (Fig. 1, right-hand panels). To determine whether or not axons contain CTβ2, we immunoprecipitated CT from distal axons of compartmented cultures of sympathetic neurons and retinal ganglion cells. In this culture system, cell bodies and proximal axons are physically separated from distal axons by a silicone grease barrier and a Teflon divider (17Campenot R. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, distal axons can be harvested independently from cell bodies/proximal axons. As shown in Fig. 1 (left), immunoblotting of anti-M-immunoprecipitated proteins with anti-M or anti-CTβ2 antibodies revealed that CTβ2 is abundant in both distal axons and cell bodies/proximal axons of sympathetic neurons and also in distal axons of retinal ganglion cells. These immunoblotting experiments demonstrate that CTβ2 is present in PC12 cells as well as in distal axons of rat sympathetic neurons and rat retinal ganglion cells. CTβ2 Facilitates Sprouting of Neurites and Branch Formation—Since CTβ2 is present in axons (Fig. 1), and since the amount of CTβ2, but not CTα, is increased during neurite outgrowth and/or extension (3Carter J.M. Waite K.A. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44988-44994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we considered that CTβ2 might regulate neurite growth. We therefore hypothesized that suppression of CTβ2 expression in PC12 cells would impair neurite growth. To test this hypothesis, we used a RNA silencing strategy to “knock down” expression of CTβ2 in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were co-transfected with a GFP-encoding mammalian expression vector (phrGFP) and either a vector encoding small interfering RNA targeted to CTβ2 mRNA (pSiCTβ2) or a vector containing a scrambled insert (designated “control”). The transfected cells were incubated with NGF to induce differentiation and neurite outgrowth. We estimated that transfection efficiency was ∼30% according to the proportion of cells that expressed GFP in several random fields of view. In pSiCTβ2-transfected cultures, the amount of CTβ2 protein, as detected by immunoblotting, was reduced compared with that in control cells (Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting of tubulin demonstrated that protein synthesis in general was not suppressed (Fig. 2A). We also measured the in vitro activity of CT in cellular homogenates. This activity represents the combined activities of CTα and CTβ. In pSiCTβ2-transfected cells, CT activity was 2.9 nmol/min/mg protein, whereas CT activity of control cells was 4.3 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 2B). A trend (p < 0.09) toward reduced CT activity (∼30%) in CTβ2-silenced cells was observed. However, since CT activity reflects the activities of both CTα (the predicted major isoform of CT) and CTβ, and since RNA interference-silencing of CTβ2 was operative in only ∼30% of the cells, it is likely that CTβ2 activity was reduced in the SiCTβ2-transfected cells. Consistent with the lack of reduction of total CT activity in SiCTβ2-transfected cells, the incorporation of [3H]choline into PC in PC12 cells over a 3-h time period was not significantly reduced (4.69 × 106 ± 0.37 × 106 dpm/mg of protein for control and 4.41 × 106 ± 0.19 × 106 dpm/mg of protein for SiCTβ2-transfected cells). To determine if suppression of CTβ2 expression altered the morphology of NGF-treated PC12 cells, the cells were co-transfected with phrGFP and pSiCTβ2, and the morphologies of cells transfected with pSiCTβ2 and those transfected with the empty vector were compared (Fig. 3). Transfected cells were identified by the presence of GFP fluorescence. Within 2 days of NGF treatment, the number of neurites (primary neurites plus branches) per cell was markedly less in CTβ2-deficient cells than in cells transfected with pSILENCER containing a scrambled insert or in control cells transfected with empty vector. After 4 days of NGF treatment, differences in the number of neurites per cell, the degree of neurite branching, and neurite length between SiCTβ2-transfected cells and control cells were more pronounced (Fig. 3, A and B versus C and D). Moreover, the neurites of siCTβ2-expressing cells grew in a more linear fashion, with fewer points of attachment to the collagen substratum and fewer directional changes. To quantify differences in numbers of primary neurites and branches, we counted the total number of primary neurites and branches per cell (Fig. 4A) in control and CTβ2-deficient cells over a 5-day period of differentiation. After 2 days of NGF treatment, control cells contained 34% more neurites per cell than did CTβ2-deficient cells (Fig. 4B) (3.09 ± 0.06 versus 2.03 ± 0.07 (p < 0.05)). During NGF treatment, control cells steadily produced primary neurites and branches. After 5 days of NGF treatment, control cells contained 5.41 ± 0.35 neurites/cell. In contrast, CTβ2-deficient cells had only marginally increased the number of neurites between day 2 (2.03 ± 0.07 neurites/cell) and day 5 (2.60 ± 0.27 neurites/cell). As a result, after 5 days of exposure to NGF, CTβ2-deficient cells contained fewer than half the neurites of control cells (2.60 ± 0.27 versus 5.41 ± 0.35 neurites/cell (p < 0.003)) (Fig. 4B). Since primary neurites and branches are distinct neurite populations (Fig. 4A) that are regulated by separate signaling pathways (22Acebes A. Ferrus A. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 557-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we determined if a decrease in the amount of CTβ2 affected each of these neurite populations. Within 2 days of NGF treatment, the extent of neurite sprouting was significantly less in CTβ2-deficient cells than in control cells (2.52 ± 0.09 versus 1.83 ± 0.01 neurites/cell (p < 0.01)) (Fig. 4C). The difference in the number of primary neurites was still apparent after 4 days of NGF-induced differentiation (control versus siCTβ2-expressing cells: 3.48 ± 0.12 versus 2.46 ± 0.18 neurites/cell (p < 0.01)) (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, CTβ2-deficient cells had far fewer branches than did control cells after 2 and 4 days of NGF treatment (Fig. 4D). Thus, CTβ2 deficiency impairs neurite sprouting and branching. CTβ2 Is Not Required for Neurite Extension—When a primary neurite has sprouted from the cell body, either the neurite continues to elongate or neurite extension pauses for branch formation. Since CTβ2-deficient PC12 cells contained fewer neurites (both primary neurites and branches) than did control cells (Figs. 3 and 4), we measured the lengths of primary neurites and branches to determine whether or not CTβ2 is required for neurite extension. In control cells, mean neurite length (including both primary neurites and branches) did not increase between days 2 and 5: 84 ± 1.5 pixels at day 2 and 100 ± 37 pixels at day 5 (Fig. 5A). Typically, once a neurite attained a length of ∼80 pixels, it had produced at least one branch, and further elongation of the primary neurite was limited. However, extension of primary neurites of CTβ2-deficient cells continued throughout the period of NGF treatment. Consequently,"

Glucocorticoids induce glutamine synthetase expression in neural tissues while NRSF/REST represses the hormonal response in non-neural cells. NRSF/REST is a modular protein that contains two independent repression domains, at the N and C termini of the molecule, and is dominantly expressed in nonneural cells. Neural tissues express however splice variants, REST4/5, which contain the repression domain at the N, but not at the C terminus of the molecule. Here we show that full-length NRSF/REST or its C-terminal domain can inhibit almost completely the induction of gene transcription by glucocorticoids. By contrast, the N-terminal domain not only fails to repress the hormonal response but rather stimulates it markedly. The inductive activity of the N-terminal domain is mediated by hBrm, which is recruited to the promoter only in the concomitant presence of GR. Importantly, a similar inductive activity is also exerted by the splice variant REST4. These findings raise the possibility that NRSF/REST exhibits a dual role in regulation of glutamine synthetase.

The expression pattern of glucocorticoid inducible genes is mainly determined by the composite of transcription factor binding sites at the regulatory region of target genes, and by the availability of transcriptional activators that cooperatively enhance the hormonal response. Expression of glucocorticoid inducible genes may also be determined by transcriptional repressors that block the hormonal response. This latter type of action is exerted, for example, by the neural restrictive silencing factor NRSF/REST, which is expressed in non-neural tissues and can restrict the hormonal induction of avian glutamine synthetase to neural tissues (1Avisar N.

Ben-Dror I. Avisar N. Oren A. Shiftan L. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Expression of glutamine synthetase is regulated by glucocorticoids, which induce a high level of glutamine synthetase in neural tissue, but not in various non-neural cells. This is despite the fact that non-neural cells express functional glucocorticoid receptor molecules capable of inducing other target genes. Analysis of the regulatory region of avian glutamine synthetase has revealed the presence of an NRSF/REST binding site (NRSE), upstream of the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) (1Avisar N. Shiftan L. Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11399-11407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This site represses the induction of gene transcription by glucocorticoids in non-neural cells and in embryonic neural retina, but not in neural cells. The repressive activity of NRSE is not restricted to the glutamine synthetase promoter and can also be conferred on a synthetic GRE-TK promoter. Its function is orientation- and position-independent with respect to the transcriptional start site, but is dependent on a location proximal to the GRE. Because NRSF/REST is mainly expressed in neural progenitors and non-neural cell types (3Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M.

Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), it has been suggested to play an important role in limiting the induction of glutamine synthetase to neural tissues. Many genes whose expression is restricted to neural tissues contain the neural restrictive silencing element, NRSE, that limits transcription in non-neural cells by binding the transcription factor NRSF/REST. NRSF/REST is a modular protein that contains, in addition to a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with eight consecutive zinc fingers, two independent repression domains located at the N and C terminals of the molecule (3Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

The repressive activity of the two domains can be exerted when fused to a heterologous DBD and is mainly mediated by histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2), which are recruited to the N-terminal repression domain through association with mSin3 (6Grimes J.A.

NRSF/REST can also recruit chromatin modifiers, such as histone methyltransferases, which presumably contribute to long term repression of neural genes (13Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B.

Cell. 2004; 14: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The NRSE site is found in a considerably large number of genes that contribute to different aspects of the neuronal phenotype (16Bruce A.W. Donaldson I.J. Wood I.C. Yerbury S.A. Sadowski M.I. Chapman M. Gottgens B. Buckley N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10458-10463Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Because NRSF/REST is dominantly expressed in non-neural cells, it has been originally viewed as a negative regulator that helps restrict neurogenesis to neurons by blocking the expression of neural specific genes in non-neural cells. An increasing number of studies suggest however that the functional role of NRSF/REST might be more complex. For example, multiple splice variants of NRSF/REST have been identified, two of which, REST 4 and REST 5, are expressed only in neural tissues and contain 5 of the 8 zinc fingers in the DBD, a nuclear targeting domain, and the N-terminal repressor domain of NRSF/REST (17Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shimojo M. Lee J.H. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13121-13126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additionally, several studies have shown that the NRSE site does not only serve as an off switch of gene expression in non-neural cells, but also modulates levels of gene expression in neurons. Transgenic analysis of the promoters of the β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (19Bessis A. Champtiaux N. Chatelin L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5906-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and L1 cell adhesion molecule gene (20Kallunki P. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3233-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the NRSE, in addition to its repressive function, is also involved in gene activation in subsets of neural cells. Similarly, transient transfection studies have shown that the NRSE site in the promoter of various neuronal genes, including Dynamin I, GluR2, and NMDA receptor, can mediate gene activation in neural cells (21Yoo J.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Studies in developing Xenopus laevis embryos have shown that inhibition of NRSF/REST action by means of a dominant negative protein or anti-sense oligonucleotides results in decreased expression of the NaV1.2 gene as well as of other neuronal genes in specific neural cells (24Armisen R. Fuentes R. Olguin P. Cabrejos M.E. Kukuljan M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8347-8351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a recent report has suggested that a small non-coding double stranded RNA, containing NRSE motif, can stimulate the differentiation of adult hippocampal stem cells to mature neurons by converting NRSF/REST from a repressor to an activator of neuronal genes (25Kuwabara T. Hsieh J. Nakashima K. Taira K. Gage F.H. Cell. 2004; 116: 779-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the NRSE site may mediate transcriptional activation or repression of neural genes depending on the cellular context. In this study we investigated the interplay between GR and NRSF/REST and examined whether both the N- and C-terminal repression domains inhibit the hormonal response. Unexpectedly, our results demonstrated that while full-length NRSF/REST or its C-terminal domain repressed gene induction, the N-terminal domain of NRSF/REST (N′NRSF) markedly elevated the hormonal response. The inductive activity of N′NRSF is not mediated by Sin3/HDAC, which has been previously shown to associate with N′NRSF, but rather by hBrm that is recruited to the promoter only in the concomitant presence of N′NRSF and GR. A similar inductive activity was exerted by REST4, a splice variant of NRSF/REST that is expressed in neural tissues and contains the N-, but not the C-terminal domain of NRSF/REST. These findings suggest that NRSF/REST might play a dual role in the hormonal control of glutamine synthetase expression: It represses glutamine synthetase induction in non-neural cells and enhances expression, via its splice variant, in neural tissues.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). pUASGRE was generated by introducing the 5×UAS sequence upstream to the GRE (17 bp) into the previously described plasmid pGRE (pΔG46TCO, Ref. 33Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pUAS66GRE contains a fragment of 66 bp inserted between the UAS and GRE sequence in pUASGRE. The fragment was derived from a subclone of the previously described p2.4GS construct (1Avisar N. Shiftan L. Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11399-11407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and includes the sequence that spans between nucleotides 528 and 572 in the promoter of avian glutamine synthetase (GenBank™ accession number AF105022). pRepUASGRE was constructed by replacing the CMV promoter in the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) with the UASGRE-TK promoter and the adjacent luciferase gene derived from pUASGRE. The pNRSEGRE construct was described before (pNRSE2-GRE-TK, Ref. 1Avisar N. Shiftan L. Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11399-11407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All above plasmids were constructed to contain the reporter gene firefly luciferase. Transfection efficiency was controlled by using pRenilla (pTK-Renilla; Promega). The yeast reporter plasmid pyUASGRE-LacZ (CEN-ARS URA3) was generated in two steps: First, a DNA fragment containing the UASGRE sequences, derived from pUASGRE, was introduced 5′ to the Cyc1 promoter into the plasmid pLacZi (Clontech). Subsequently, the UASGRE-Cyc1 LacZ fragment was excised from the plasmid generated in the first step and used to replace the LacZ gene in the plasmid YcpLac33. The expression plasmid pyGR (2μ TRP1) consists of full-length rat GR cDNA expressed from the yeast GPD promoter (pG-N795, Ref. 34Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). To generate the pyN′NRSF (2μ LEU2) expression vector, the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–152 of NRSF/REST was derived from pN′NRSF and introduced in-frame to the Gal4 DBD in pY2 (35Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The pY2 plasmid was termed pyGal4DBD and served as control. In both plasmids the auxotrophic TRP1 marker was replaced by LEU2 and the ARS-Cen was exchanged with a 2μ fragment. (The cloning details can be obtained upon request.) Tissue and Cell Culture and Transfection Procedures—Retinal tissue was isolated under sterile conditions from eyes of chicken embryos (White Leghorn) at day 10 of embryonic development. The tissue was organ-cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) on a gyratory shaker at 38 °C. Plasmid DNA was transfected into pieces of intact retinal tissue by electroporation, under conditions described before (33Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following electroporation, retinas transfected in the same cuvette were placed in two Erlenmeyer flasks and cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 0.33 μg/ml cortisol. HeLa, COS7, and SW13 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Neuro-2A cells were grown in MEM-Eagle supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mm MEM-sodium pyruvate. For transfection, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/plate and transfected after 24 h with DNA using the calcium phosphate method for COS7 and SW13 cells and jet-PEITM (Polyplus transfection) for HeLa and Neuro-2 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was controlled by cotransfection of pTK-Renilla. Total DNA amount was kept constant by adding empty vectors. Cells were cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 0.33 μg/ml cortisol (Sigma), with or without 100 ng/ml TSA (Sigma). Luciferase Firefly and Renilla activities were assayed with the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega) and recorded by a luminometer (LKB, Rockville, MD). Protein Preparation and Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared from COS7 or SW13 cells (transfected or untransfected) by sonication of the cells in passive lysis buffer (Promega) together with the recommended amount of Complete, a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany), followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Yeast cell extracts were prepared by alkaline lysis, as described (36Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Protein amounts were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with the following mouse antibodies (Abs) anti-Myc (9B11; Cell Signaling) or NRSF/REST (12C11, a generous gift from D. J. Anderson and co-workers (37Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar)), rabbit Abs anti-Vph1 (10D-A7-B2; Molecular Probes, Inc), hBrm or Brg1 (N-19 or H-88, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat Abs anti-HDAC2 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) were used, and the cross reactivity was visualized by the enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL) procedure (Pierce). Nuclear Proteins and Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS7 cells that were plated at a density of 2 × 106/10-cm plate and transfected with DNA. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Lee et al. (38Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of extraction buffer was added to each plate (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) together with the recommended amount of Complete. After three freeze-thaw cycles, cytoplasmic extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and pellets were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol) together with the recommended amount of Complete. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, nuclear extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. For immunoprecipitation, nuclear extracts (0.5 mg) were precleared by incubation for 16 h at 4 °C with preimmune serum bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Cleared extracts were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose bound to mouse anti-Myc antibodies (Abs) (9B11, Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with Buffer I (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) and once with 20 mm Tris (pH 8) prior to the addition of sample buffer. The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Yeast Cells—All yeast experiments were performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YJO (39Balasubramanian B. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2977-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). YJO: MATa; trp1; ura3-52; leu2-3,112; ade2-101; gal4Δ; gal80Δ; MEL1. The disrupted SIN3 locus was obtained from strain Y01695 (EUROSCARF). Y01695: MAT a; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; YOL004w:: kanMX4. For SIN3 replacement in YJO the disrupted SIN3 locus from Y01695 chromosomal DNA was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides TGTGTGCCAAAGCAGTGAACC (S-1) and TGGTGTTCCTACGGGAGATGG (S-2). The obtained 2.8-kb PCR product was transformed into YJO yeast strain allowing homologues recombination to occur. Yeast cells were incubated for 2 h at 30°C in YPD-rich medium for recovery and then streaked onto YPD plates containing G418. SIN3 disruption in the obtained transformants (termed ΔSin3) was confirmed by two sets of PCR reactions: 1) Primers S-1 and S-2, which generated a 2.8-kb fragment in ΔSin3 and a 5.8-kb fragment in wild-type cells. 2) Forward primer GGGTCAATCTTTAGCTTGGA upstream of the deletion and reverse primer CTGTCAAGGAGGGTATTCTG downstream of the KanMX4, a region unique to the disrupted gene (40Giaever G.

Yeast cells were transformed with the use of a lithium acetate protocol (Clontech). Yeast cells were grown overnight in synthetic dropout medium supplemented with 2% glucose and amino acids as required, and then diluted in YPD to an optical density (OD600 nm) of 0.3. Cultures were incubated with or without 10–4m deoxycorticosterone (DOC, Sigma) and harvested after 5 h. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as previously described (41Paz I. Meunier J.R. Choder M. Gene. 1999; 236: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and normalized to protein amount. The N-terminal Domain of NRSF/REST Enhances the Hormonal Response—NRSF/REST possesses two distinct repression domains that lie near the N and C termini of the molecule. To investigate the interplay between NRSF/REST and GR, we first examined whether both domains can silence the hormonal response. To minimize effects because of the action of endogenous NRSF/REST on transfected promoters, or exogenous NRSF/REST on cellular genes, we utilized expression vectors that contain Gal4-DBD fused to full-length NRSF/REST (NRSF) or to either the N (N′NRSF) or C (C′NRSF) terminal repression domains, and a reporter plasmid (UASGRE), which contains binding sites for GR (GRE) and Gal4 (UAS). Transfection experiments in HeLa cells revealed that, as expected, full-length NRSF/REST repressed the hormonal response. Similar results were obtained with C′NRSF. By contrast, N′NRSF not only failed to repress the hormonal response, but rather stimulated it markedly (Fig. 1A). The inductive activity of N′NRSF was dose-dependent, saturable (Fig. 1B) and required the presence of binding sites for both N′NRSF and GR. N′NRSF had no effect on promoter activity in the absence of a N′NRSF binding site (Fig. 1C), and repressed promoter activity in the absence of a binding site for GR (Fig. 1F). Overexpression of GR, by transfection of a GR expression vector, elevated the inductive activity in a dose-dependent manner and under all examined conditions N′NRSF could further stimulate the hormonal response (Fig. 1E). The N′NRSF binding site in the UAS-GRE construct is located 17-bp upstream of the GRE. In the glutamine synthetase gene, the NRSE sequence is located 66-bp upstream of the GRE (1Avisar N. Shiftan L. Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11399-11407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We examined whether replacement of the 17-bp sequence in the UAS-GRE construct with the 66-bp sequence influences the mode of action. Our results showed that here too NRSF and C′NRSF repressed, while N′NRSF activated the hormonal-dependent response (Fig. 1D). The inductive activity of N′NRSF could also be observed in explants of embryonic neural retina (Fig. 1G), and in COS-7 cells, which lack endogenous GR and were therefore cotransfected with a GR expression vector (Fig. 1H). Here too, C′NRSF repressed while N′NRSF elevated the hormonal response. Considering that transiently transfected DNA might not form proper chromatin structure, we decided to examine whether the activating function N′NRSF can also be observed on a replicating gene. Therefore, we cloned the UAS-GRE construct into pREP4 episomal vector that contains Epstein-Barr virus replication origin and encodes nuclear antigen EBNA-1. Cotransfection experiments clearly showed that chromatin formation did not hinder the ability of N′NRSF to enhance the hormonal response (Fig. 1I). The Inductive Activity of N′NRSF Is Not Mediated by the Sin3-HDAC Complex—Removal of acetyl groups from histones by HDACs frequently accompanies suppression of gene activity, and therefore HDACs are generally viewed as corepressors. There are now numerous examples, however, where HDACs appear to be required for gene activation (42Laribee R.N. Klemsz M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Wang X.Q. Alfaro M.L. Evans G.F. Zuckerman S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 66"

To describe the mechanism of this effect, we produced Tβ4 mutants with impaired functional motifs and tested their intracellular location and activity. Cytoplasmic distributions of Tβ4(AcSDKPT/4A), Tβ4(KLKKTET/7A), and Tβ4(K16A) mutants fused with green fluorescent protein did not differ significantly from those of wild-type Tβ4. Overexpression of Tβ4, Tβ4(AcSDKPT/4A), and Tβ4(K16A) affected intracellular formation of actin filaments. As expected, Tβ4(K16A) uptake by nuclei was impaired. On the other hand, overexpression of Tβ4(KLKKTET/7A) resulted in developing the actin filament network typical of adhering cells, indicating that the mutant lacked the actin binding site. The mechanism by which intracellular Tβ4 induced the PAI-1 gene did not depend upon the N-terminal tetrapeptide AcSDKP and depended only partially on its ability to bind G-actin or enter the nucleus. Both Tβ4 and Tβ4(AcSDKPT/4A) induced the PAI-1 gene to the same extent, whereas mutants Tβ4(KLKKTET/7A) and Tβ4(K16A) retained about 60% of the original activity. By proteomic analysis, the Ku80 subunit of ATP-dependent DNA helicase II was found to be associated with Tβ4. Ku80 and Tβ4 consistently co-immunoprecipitated in a complex from endothelial cells. Co-transfection of endothelial cells with the Ku80 deletion mutants and Tβ4 showed that the C-terminal arm domain of Ku80 is directly involved in this interaction. Furthermore, down-regulation of Ku80 by specific short interference RNA resulted in dramatic reduction in PAI-1 expression at the level of both mRNA and protein synthesis. These data suggest that Ku80 functions as a novel receptor for Tβ4 and mediates its intracellular activity.

Tβ4 is considered to be a major actin sequestering molecule, which specifically binds monomeric actin (G-actin) forming a 1:1 complex, or by additionally including profilin, forming a ternery complex (23Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which Tβ4 influences cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation is generally believed to be linked with maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between G-actin and F-actin, critical for the rapid reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Under some conditions Tβ4 can be found in large amounts in extracellular fluids and shows a broad range of biological activities. For example, the Tβ4 level in blood may amount to micromolar concentrations, particularly in prethrombotic states characterized by the enhanced reactivity of blood platelets (24Tang Y.Q. Yeaman M.R. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6524-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Recent observations indicate that Tβ4 can express its activity toward different cells via receptor-mediated mechanisms. Thus, Tβ4 externally added to endothelial cells: (a) induces expression and release of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) by the mechanism involving activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade leading to enhanced c-Fos/c-Jun binding to the AP-1-like element present in the PAI-1 promoter (25Al-Nedawi K.N. Czyz M. Bednarek R. Szemraj J. Swiatkowska M. Cierniewska-Cieslak A. Wyczolkowska J. Cierniewski C.S. Blood. 2004; 103: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Boncela J. Smolarczyk K.

Saxena M. White M.D. DiMaio J.M. Srivastava D. Nature. 2004; 432: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and (c) promotes skin and corneal wound healing through its effects on cell migration, angiogenesis, and possibly cell survival (4Grant D.S. Rose W. Yaen C. Goldstein A. Martinez J. Kleinman H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Malinda K.M. Sidlu G.S. Mani H. Banaudha K. Maheshwari R.K.

Hazlett L.D. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 74: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) through which it functions remains unknown. It is not clear whether Tβ4 effects are mediated by (a) extracellular or (b) intracellular receptors, or if (c) Tβ4 is taken up by cells and its activity is manifested after interaction with G-actin and modulation of the actin filament system. Therefore, in our present studies we attempt to describe intracellular mechanisms by which Tβ4 may activate endothelial cells to up-regulate PAI-1 expression. Particularly, we searched for proteins that may interact in endothelial cells with Tβ4 and thus mediate its activating effects. Based on our affinity binding experiments, co-immunoprecipitation, and proteomic analyses we identified the Ku80 subunit of ATP-dependent DNA helicase II to specifically interact with Tβ4. Specific down-regulation of its expression by short interference RNA (siRNA) abolished the stimulatory activity of Tβ4 toward PAI-1 expression suggesting its contribution in controlling PAI-1 gene activity. Reagents—All standard tissue culture reagents including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were from Invitrogen (Eggenstein, Germany). Wizard Miniprep and Maxiprep kits for isolation of plasmid DNA were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Protein A/G-agarose, Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting substrate, and BCA Protein Assay Kit were obtained from Pierce. Anti-PAI-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was from American Diagnostica (Pfungstadt, Germany). Anti-Ku80 rabbit polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). pCMV-Myc and pCMV-hemagglutinin (HA) Vector Set with anti-HA tag and anti-Myc tag antibodies were from Clontech. All synthetic short interference RNA duplexes were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). All other reagents, except where noted, were from Sigma. Cell Cultures—Human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926, derived by fusion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with continuous human lung carcinoma cell line A549 (28Emeis J.J. Edgell C.J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained as a gift from Professor Cora-Jean S. Edgell (Pathology Department, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). This endothelial hybrid cell line is presently the best characterized macrovascular EC line (for review, see Ref. 29Bouis D. Hospers G.A. Meijer C. Molema G. Mulder N.H. Angiogenesis. 2001; 4: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, HAT (100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, and 16 μm thymidine), and antibiotics in a 90–95% humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Construction of Tβ4 and Its Mutants Fused with EGFP—DNA coding Tβ4 sequence (135 nucleotides) was synthesized (Bionovo, Ulm, Germany) and amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CTCCGCCTGGGATCCATGTCTGACAAACCC-3′ and 5′-CTCAATAAGCTTTTACGATTCGCCTGC-3′. Then, it was first subcloned into BamHI and HindIII sites in pRSETa, amplified from pRSETa-Tβ4 using primers 5′-CTCCGCCTGAAGCTTATGTCTGACAAACCC-3′ and 5′-CTCAATGGATCCTTACGATTCGCCTGC-3′, and subcloned into pEGFP-N1. The resulting pEGFP-N1-Tβ4 was propagated in Escherichia coli, purified with Wizard Midiprep (Promega), and sequenced to confirm the open reading frame. Selected regions of Tβ4 were modified by scanning mutagenesis replacing the chosen amino acid residues by Ala in pRSETa-Tβ4. The following mutants were obtained: (a) Tβ4(AcSDKPT/4A) in which the N-terminal AcSDKP sequence is substituted by alanine residues. For this purpose mutagenic primers 5′-TGGGGATCCATGGCAGCAGCAGCAGATATGGCTGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGCCATATCTGCTGCTGCTGCCATGGATCCCCA-3′ were used. (b) Tβ4(KLKKTET/7A), lacking the G-actin binding site. This mutant was obtained using mutagenic primers 5′-GATAAGTCGAAAGCAGCAGCAGCAGAGACGCAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCTTGCGTCTCTGCTGCTGCTGCTTTCGACTTATC-3′.(c) Tβ4(K16A), with a disfunctional nuclear localization signal sequence obtained by means of mutagenic primers 5′-AAATTCGATAAGTCGGCACTGAAGAAGACAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCTGTCTTCTTCAGTGCCGACTTATCGAATTT-3′. All Tβ4 mutants were produced using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis set (Stratagene), propagated in E. coli, purified with Wizard Midiprep (Promega), and sequenced to confirm the open reading frame. Plasmids containing the EGFP-Tβ4 or EGFP-Tβ4 mutants were transfected into EA.hy 926 cells with Lipofectamine. Briefly, 5.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine solution were incubated for 45 min in 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and then diluted with 800 μl of Opti-MEM. This solution was added to growing EA.hy 926 cells in 20% fetal bovine serum medium. Expression of the fusion construct was evaluated by confocal microscopy after 24 and 48 h. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—To measure PAI-1 mRNA, EA.hy 926 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-Tβ4, pEGFP-N1-Tβ4(SDKP/4A), pEGFP-N1-Tβ4(KLKKTET/7A), and pEGFP-N1-Tβ4(K16A) were used for total RNA, extracted by the TRIzol reagent method (Invitrogen) using a single-step purification protocol. RNA pellets were dissolved in water, and their concentrations and purity determined by spectrophotometer readings at 260 and 280 nm. Then, mRNAs for PAI-1 and β-actin expression were quantified by real-time RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as we recently described (30Swiatkowska M. Szemraj J. Cierniewski C.S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5821-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide primer pairs were used: 5′-TGCTGGTGAATGCCCTCTACT-3′ and 5′-CGGTCATTCCCAGGTTCTCTA-3′ as well as 5′-CGTACCACTGGCATCGTGAT-3′ and 5′-GTGTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG-3′ specific for mRNAs of PAI-1 and β-actin, respectively. Relative gene expression levels were obtained using the ΔΔCt method (31Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Amplification of specific transcripts were further confirmed by obtaining melting curve profiles. Similarly, mRNAs of Ku80, Tβ4, and von Willebrand factor were analyzed using appropriate oligonucleotide primer pairs. Tβ4-binding Proteins—Recombinant Tβ4 was expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3)pLysS) transformed with pRSETa-Tβ4. Harvested cells were centrifuged, resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and sonicated on ice. Bacterial lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation for an hour at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter, and loaded onto a HisTrap column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) connected to an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a 5–500 mm imidazole gradient. The purity of recombinant Tβ4 was confirmed by reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Recombinant Tβ4 containing a 12-residue His tag (MRGSHHHHHHGS) at its C terminus was biotinylated with freshly prepared p-diazobenzoyl biocytin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). To search for Tβ4-binding proteins in endothelial cells, total cell extract, nuclear proteins, and the cellular membrane fraction were isolated from EA.hy 926 cells. To obtain the cell lysate, EA.hy 926 cells were extracted with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 5% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture) and cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Crude nuclear extracts of EA.hy 926 cells were prepared essentially as described by Dignam et al. (32Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), except that modified buffer C was used during nuclear extraction (33Moll T. Czyz M. Holzmuller H. Hofer-Warbinek R. Wagner E. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Hofer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3849-3857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Membranes of EA.hy 926 cells were isolated as described by Thepparit and Smith (34Thepparit C. Smith D.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12647-12656Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. In typical experiments, the cell lysate, the extract of nuclear proteins or solubilized membranes were divided into two parts: into the first one biotinylated Tβ4 was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C and the second was used as a control without Tβ4, kept under the same conditions. Then, streptavidin-Sepharose beads were added to both samples and incubated for an hour at 4 °C. The beads were then washed exhaustively with PBS, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250), boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized by staining with silver according to the method compatible with the analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry (35Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) and the selected bands subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. Mass Spectrometry, Data Base Search, and Data Processing—Proteins in each gel slice were subjected to reduction with 10 mm dithiothreitol, alkylation with 50 mm iodoacetamide, and tryptic digestion with modified trypsin (10 μg/ml; Promega) at 37 °C for 14 h. After in-gel digestion, the product peptides were extracted stepwise with three portions of 60 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 2% acetonitrile and loaded on an RP-18 precolumn (LC Packings). Peptides were eluted to a nano-HPLC RP18 column (75 μm × 15 cm capillary; LC Packings) by acetonitrile gradient in the presence of formic acid and then directly applied into an electrospray (ISI-Q-TOF-Micromass) spectrometer. The spectrometer was working in the regime of data-dependent MS to MS/MS switch giving peptide sequencing data in addition to mass fingerprint data. The NCBI nonredundant protein data base was searched with the Mascot program (Matrix Science). The list of top 20 candidates for each sample was verified by inspection of the quality of sequencing data. We examined their automatic ordering manually in terms of their reliability scores and MS spectrum profiles to pick up only highly reliable peptide data (sorted data). Construction of Ku80 Deletion Mutants and Tβ4 in the pCMV Vector—To express Ku80 (the 80-kDa subunit of ATP-dependent DNA helicase II), total RNA was isolated from EA.hy 926 cells using TriPure reagent (Roche) and reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus Reverse Transcriptase (Epicenter). The resulting DNA encoding the whole length gene of Ku80 was amplified with the following primer pair: 5′-TACTCTAGAATTCGGATGGTGCGGTCGGGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCAAGCGGCCGCCTATATCATGTCCAA-3′. The amplification product was cloned into EcoRI and NotI sites of pCMV-Myc vector expressing the protein containing the N-terminal c-Myc epitope tag. Deletion mutants of Ku80 were constructed essentially as described for the insertion of the Ku80 coding sequence but using PCR products corresponding to its different fragments. Thus, pCMV-Myc vectors expressing Ku80-(1–249), Ku80-(1–460), Ku80-(1–580), and Ku80-(368–732) were constructed using the following primer pairs: 5′-GACGCGAGAATTCGGATGGTGCGGTCGGGG-3′ and 5′-CATACAAGCGGCCGCCTAGCAGGGCCAGTG-3′; 5′-TACTCTAGAATTCGGATGGTGCGGTCGGGG-3′ and 5′-CATACTAGCGGCCGCCTAGGAGTCAATCAA-3′; 5′-TACTCTAGAATTCGGATGGTGCGGTCGGGG-3′ and 5′-CATGTATGCGGCCGCCTAACTGGAGACGCT-3′; 5′-GACGCGAGAATTCGGATGAGAGATGATGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCAAGCGGCCGCCTATATCATGTCCAA-3′, respectively. Likewise, synthetic DNA coding Tβ4 sequence was amplified using the oligonucleotide primers pair: 5′-CGCCCGCGAATTCGGATGTCTGACAAACCC-3′ and 5′-CTCAATAGCGGCCGCTCATTACGATTCGCCTGC-3′. Subsequently, the resulting amplicon was inserted into EcoRI and NotI sites of pCMV-HA vector expressing the protein with HA epitope tag at the N terminus. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—EA.hy 926 cells were transiently cotransfected with pCMV-HA-Tβ4 (4 μg) and either pCMV-Myc-Ku80 or one of the mutants (pCMV-Myc-Ku80-(1–249), pCMV-Myc-Ku80-(1–460), pCMV-Myc-Ku80-(1–580), pCMV-Myc-Ku80-(368–372)) (4 μg) using Lipofectamine and collected after 48 h in lysis buffer (PBS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were then incubated with 2.5 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody to Myc tag on a rotator overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, 100 μl of Protein A/G-agarose bead slurry was added to each cell extract and the incubation continued for another 3 h. The beads were washed, suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins released from the resin were separated by electrophoresis by 7% SDS-PAGE, electrotransfered onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunodetected by HA tag mouse monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitation of the Ku80·Tβ4 complex from endothelial cell extracts was performed as described previously (26Boncela J. Smolarczyk K. Wyroba E. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1066-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RNA Interference of Ku80—For silencing the Ku80 gene expression a set of four synthetic siRNAs targeting the following sequences of Ku80 mRNA were used: Ku1, 5′-GCAUGGAUGUGAUUCAACA-3′ (position 374–392), Ku2, AAACUUCCGUGUUCUAGUG (position 1821–1839), Ku3, 5′-CGAGUAACCAGCUCAUAAA-3′ (position 1868–1886), and Ku4, 5′-GAGCAGCGCUUUAACAACU-3′ (position 1986–2005). siRNA silencing the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene served as a positive control, with the following sense strand sequence: 5′-UGGUUUACAUGUUCCAAUAUU-3′. As negative control the functional non-targeting siRNA was used, containing 4 mismatches for any human, mouse, and rat gene. The sequence of its sense strand was 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU-3′. Synthetic siRNAs (200 pm) were transfected to 50–80% confluent EA.hy 926 cells with Lipofectamine (10 μl) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of incubation synthetic Tβ4 at 160 nm or tumor necrosis factor-α at 10 ng/ml was added to particular cell cultures with the silenced Ku80 gene and concurrently to nontransfected cells. The cells were incubated for another 24 h and then harvested with TriPure reagent for total RNA and protein isolation. Subsequently, mRNA for PAI-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Ku80 expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR as described above. The following primer pair specific for Ku80 were 5′-GCAGCGCTTTAACAACTTCC-3′ and 5′-CAGAGGCTTCCTCTTTGGTG-3′. Western Immunoblotting—Protein isolated from EA.hy 926 cells transfected with vectors expressing Tβ4 and its mutants, Ku80 or siRNA, were extracted with TriPure reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After extraction, pellets were dissolved in 1% SDS aqueous solution and the protein concentrations were measured with BCA Protein Assay Kit and equalized between samples with 1% SDS. Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 then immunodetected by anti-PAI-1 and anti-Ku80 or anti-Myc tag mouse monoclonal antibody. Immunodetection was accomplished using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit and Kodak BioMax Light Film (Eastman Kodak). Developed films were scanned and protein bands quantitated by Gel Doc 2000 Gel Documentation System (Bio-Rad). Confocal Microscopy—For microscopic examination of EA.hy 926 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-Tβ4 or its mutants, cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) were plated on Permanox Coverslips in 8-well tissue culture chamber slides (NUNC) with detachable chambered upper structures. After 24 h incubation, they were fixed with ice-cold 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin). They were also counterstained with TRITC-phalloidin or Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) to visualize actin filaments or nuclei, respectively. Endogenous Tβ4 was detected in the untransfected cells with rabbit antibodies specific to Tβ4, followed by staining with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein. The cells were then visualized using a helium/neon ion laser (543 nm excitation) and anal"
https://openalex.org/W1976944104,"We have previously shown that angiomotin (Amot) mediates angiostatin inhibition of endothelial migration and tube formation in vitro. A crucial role of angiomotin in regulating endothelial cell motility is indicated by the findings that knockdown of Amot in zebrafish reduces the number of filopodia of endothelial tip cells and severely impairs the migration of intersegmental vessels. In addition, targeting angiomotin using DNA vaccination inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. In this report, we have generated antibodies that, similar to angiostatin, bind to angiomotin on the endothelial cell surface. These antibodies inhibited FGF-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced endothelial migration in the Boyden chamber assay. Furthermore, the anti-Amot B06 antibody significantly reduced the number of endothelial filopodia and inhibited vessel migration during retinal angiogenesis in vivo. We also show that systemic or local treatment with this antibody inhibits pathological blood vessel formation associated with tumor growth or laser-induced choroid neovascularization of the eye. These findings provide a rationale for using angiomotin antibodies for specifically targeting endothelial migration in angiogenesis-dependent diseases."

Proteinases modulate this control by processing protein signals and/or their receptors. Here, we show that insulin-like growth factor I can trigger hypertrophic development by stimulating production and/or activation of proteinases in some populations of chick embryo chondrocytes. Cell surface targets of the enzymes include 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 membrane-associated rapid response steroid receptor (1,25 D3 MARRS receptor), also known as ERp57/GRp58/ERp60. This protein is anchored to the outer surface of plasma membranes and inhibits late chondrocyte differentiation after binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Upon treatment with insulin-like growth factor I, 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor is cleaved into two fragments of ∼30 and 22 kDa. This process is abrogated along with hypertrophic development by E-64 or cystatin C, inhibitors of cysteine proteinases. Cell differentiation is enhanced by treatment with antibodies to 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor that either block binding of the inhibitory ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or inactivate 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor left intact after treatment with proteinase inhibitors. Therefore, proteolytic shedding of 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor constitutes a molecular mechanism eliminating the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced barrier against late cartilage differentiation and is a potentially important step during endochondral ossification or cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis.

Endochondral ossification is one of two mechanisms of bone formation in vertebrates and is particularly important for development, growth, and repair of long bones. During this process, differentiated cartilage cells transit through a cascade of late differentiation events that sequentially include cell proliferation and several steps of chondrocyte maturation culminating in hypertrophy. After invasion of blood vessels into hypertrophic cartilage from subchondral bone, the majority of hypertrophic cells undergo apoptosis and the cartilage template is remodeled into trabecular bone. Each chondrocyte differentiation phase is accompanied by a change in cell shape and the expression of stage-specific markers. The cells produce collagens II, IX, and XI at all stages, albeit at different steady-state levels. In addition, the expression repertoire includes collagen VI and matrilin 1 at early proliferative stages and Indian hedgehog during pre-hypertrophy. Collagen X and alkaline phosphatase are well established surrogate markers for the overtly hypertrophic stage of late chondrocyte differentiation. Hypertrophic chondrocytes also reduce, or even terminate, their production of collagen II (1Cancedda R. Descalzi C.F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev.

Collagen X is not made in the superficial or intermediate layers of normal articular cartilage but is strongly up-regulated in osteoarthritic cartilage, particularly near surface fissures. For this reason, it has been speculated that osteoarthritis is associated with illegitimate induction of late differentiation in articular chondrocytes (7von der Mark K. Kirsch T. Nerlich A. Kuss A. Weseloh G. Glückert K. Stöss H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Not least for this reason, there has been a considerable interest in the molecular mechanisms of the environmental control of this process.Late chondrocyte differentiation in vivo is controlled by systemic hormones as well as by locally acting autocrine signals derived from chondrocytes themselves or by paracrine signals derived from cells of surrounding tissues, e.g. the perichondrium or subchondral blood vessels. When cultured in suspension under several conditions (for review see Ref. 1Cancedda R. Descalzi C.F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), chondrocytes in vitro can recapitulate late differentiation, and the order of events and their control elements closely resemble those occurring in vivo. Late chondrocyte differentiation is subject to positive and negative control elements that interact to regulate the rate and progression of the process (3Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J.

Likewise, systemic hormones, including growth hormone, thyroid hormone, estrogen, androgen, vitamin D, and glucocorticoids, control the rate and extent of the process at several points. Further, signals may erect barriers against late differentiation at earlier stages but may boost it later. For example, transforming growth factor β2 and fibroblast growth factor-2 in synergy prevent differentiation at early proliferative stages but fibroblast growth factor-2 alone supports it later (8Babarina A.V.

In a feedback loop of paracrine control, perichondrial cells, induced by chondrocyte-derived Indian Hedgehog, produce parathyroid hormone-related peptide that delays progression of late differentiation at late proliferative stages (10Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). However, parathyroid hormone can promote differentiation at other stages (11Erdmann S. Müller W. Bahrami S. Vornehm S.I. Mayer H. Bruckner P. von der Mark K. Burkhardt H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, extracellular signals also can stem from suprastructures of the extracellular matrix. For example, fibrils containing cartilage collagens II, IX, and XI interact with chondrocytes through matrix receptors and thereby stabilize the differentiated cartilage phenotype, whereas collagen I-containing fibrils cause the cells to undergo dedifferentiation (12Farjanel J. Schürmann G. Bruckner P. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: S55-S63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).At day 17 of in ovo development, the sternum of chick embryos still is entirely cartilaginous and contains chondrocytes at different stages of late differentiation. In cells derived from the caudal third, hereafter called caudal cells, hypertrophy is not easily achieved in vitro. Cells derived from the cranial third, hereafter called cranial cells, proceed to become overtly hypertrophic and produce large amounts of collagen X when appropriately stimulated in vitro, e.g. with insulin-like growth factor I or thyroid hormone. It has been thought that the anabolic response elicited by the hormones was tantamount to the induction of late differentiation. However, this notion does not explain easily the elimination of autocrine barriers against hypertrophy, such as those mentioned above.Many stationary and diffusible regulators as well as their cell surface receptors are proteins. Therefore, proteinases are not merely destructive effectors of extracellular matrix degradation but also intervene in regulatory networks, both by eliminating control elements and by converting precursors into active agents. For instance, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) modify the extracellular matrix microenvironment, resulting in alteration of cellular behavior. They also regulate cell attachment and, thereby, differentiation and apoptosis. In addition, they modulate mediator activities by direct cleavage or by release from extracellular matrix stores. Furthermore, they control the activity of other proteinases by activating their zymogens or by their elimination through proteolysis (13Ortega N. Behonick D. Stickens D. Werb Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 995: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have shown that proteinases of endothelial cells abrogate the arrest of late differentiation in vitro, most likely by acting in an activation cascade targeting chondrocyte surface components or their soluble ligands (8Babarina A.V. Möllers U. Bittner K. Vischer P. Bruckner P. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Bittner K. Vischer P. Bartholmes P. Bruckner P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Additionally, cysteine proteinases, especially the cathepsins, have been implicated in several proteolytic scenarios during development, growth, remodeling, and aging, as well as in a variety of pathological processes. During endochondral ossification, cathepsins B, H, K, L, and S were detected immunohistochemically in growth plates of rats and humans (15Söderstrom M. Salminen H. Glumoff V. Kirschke H. Aro H. Vuorio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Nakase T. Kaneko M. Tomita T. Myoui A. Ariga K. Sugamoto K. Uchiyama Y. Ochi T. Yoshikawa H. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 114: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and are thought to be involved in the proteolysis of several extracellular matrix components.The seco-steroid 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2 Vit D3) is an essential regulator of bone development, growth, and remodeling (17Norman A.W. Hurwitz S. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vitamin D hormone modulates proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes both by mechanisms involving the classical nuclear vitamin D receptor and by rapid actions through membrane-associated receptors (18Boyan B.D. Dean D.D. Sylvia V.L. Schwartz Z. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In chondrocytes of the growth zone, binding of 1,25-(OH)2 Vit D3 to a membrane-associated vitamin D receptor molecule modulates gene expression through the ERK1/2 pathway activated by phospholipase C. In addition, protein kinase C turns on the synthesis of prostaglandins that also increase ERK1/2 activities. In chondrocytes of the resting zone, however, rapid actions are not mediated through 1,25-(OH)2 Vit D3 but, rather, via 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Membrane binding of this vitamin D metabolite induces mitogen-activated protein kinase activity via phospholipase D and decreased prostaglandin production (19Schwartz Z. Ehland H. Sylvia V.L. Larsson D. Hardin R.R. Bingham V. Lopez D. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2775-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Rapid, non-genomic effects of 1α, 25-(OH)2 Vit D3 have been attributed in several tissues and species to a 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-binding protein at the cell surface, which is called 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 membrane-associated rapid response steroid receptor (1,25 D3 MARRS receptor) and which is also known as ERp57, GRp58, or ERp60 (GenBank™ accession code 373899) (20Nemere I.

In addition, we found that these cysteine proteinases target membrane-associated signaling by vitamin D hormones, the last barrier against late differentiation of cranial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—AB099 is a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor (20Nemere I. Ray R. McManus W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E1104-E1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), produced by means of the multiple antigenic peptide system using the first 20 N-terminal amino acids of the putative membrane vitamin D receptor. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from donkey (Amersham Biosciences) served as secondary antibody for immunoblotting. Binding of AB099 in immunohistochemistry was detected with the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase protocol with a mouse anti-rabbit IgG-bridging antibody (both DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark).Chondrocyte Cultures—Chondrocytes were isolated from the cranial third of 17-day-old chick embryo sterna by overnight digestion with collagenase. The cells were cultured in agarose suspension cultures under serum-free conditions as described (25Tschan T. Hörler I. Houze Y. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in 0.5% low melting agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom) and allowed to sediment on the culture dishes pre-coated with 1% high melting agarose in water. Cells were grown at densities of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom) containing 60 μg/ml β-aminopropionitrile fumarate, 25 μg/ml sodium ascorbate, 1 mm cysteine, 1 mm pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium) for 14 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For two-dimensional electrophoresis or one-step RT-PCR the cells were cultured on top of agarose layers at high density (8 × 106 cells/ml) in complete medium for 48 h. Where indicated, 100 ng/ml IGF-I, 10-6-10-7m 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 24 (R5),25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (both Biomol), AB099 in a dilution of 1:1000, and/or the proteinase inhibitors E-64 (0,14-14 μm; Roche Applied Science) or cystatin C (7,5-750 pm; Calbiochem) were added to the medium during the whole culture duration. Medium was changed every 2-3 days. Micrographs were recorded on day 12 with an inverse microscope (Axiovert 100 equipped with Axiovision 2.0; Zeiss).Expression of Differentiation Markers—After 14 days in culture, newly synthesized chondrocyte proteins were metabolically labeled for 24 h with 1 μCi/ml of [14C]proline (uniformly labeled, 250 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Science products). Collagens were isolated after limited digestion with pepsin from the culture medium or the agarose layers and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4.5-15% gradient gels, followed by fluorography as described (26Bruckner P. Hörler I. Mendler M. Houze Y. Winterhalter K.H. Eich-Bender S.G. Spycher M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2537-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity was monitored in culture medium with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (27Bessey A.O. Lowry O.H. Brock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 321-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One-step RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer from chondrocytes cultured in suspension on top of agarose for 7 days. Prior to the one-step PCR protocol (Qiagen), RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C. The following primer sequences were used: β actin forward, ggtatgtgcaaggccggttt, β actin reverse, atggctggggtgttgaaggt, amplicon size: 353 bp; collagen X forward, acctgcaggatccctggtctat, collagen X reverse, atcaatgacagcactgcctgagg, amplicon size, 161 bp. RT-PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel.Immunohistochemical Analysis—Tibiae of 17-day-old chick embryos were fixed for 24 h in 3% paraformaldehyde in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl (PBS). After decalcification in 10% EDTA in 3% Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, the samples were paraffin-embedded. 3-μm sections were deparaffinized and subjected to digestion for 90 min at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml of bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Serva) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.3, containing 150 mm NaCl (28Müller-Glauser W. Humbel B. Glatt M. Strauli P. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, unspecific antibody binding sites were blocked at 4 °C overnight with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (DAKO) and 50 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. Sections were then exposed for 1 h at 37 °C to AB099 (1:1000) or rabbit immunoglobulin fraction (Dako), diluted in blocking solution. Immune complexes were stained with the APAAP detection kit, as recommended by the manufacturer with mouse anti-rabbit IgG as a bridging antibody (Dako) and NBT/BCIP® solution (Sigma) as chromogenic substrate.Immunoblotting—Proteins in 1 ml of conditioned medium from chondrocytes cultured in agarose were precipitated with 3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and were subjected to 4.5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Pre-stained protein standards within a range of 207 to 7.5 kDa (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular mass markers. Proteins were electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) for 3 h at 4 °C. Filters were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% dry skim milk + 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight with a rabbit antiserum (AB099, diluted 1:5000) directed against 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor or RP1MMP13 (Triple Point Biologics, Inc.; Forest Grove, OR, 1:1000) directed against MMP-13, washed with Tris-buffered saline, and incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody from donkey (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were visualized with ECL reagent by exposure on blue light-sensitive autoradiography films (Pierce).Analysis of Chondrocyte Membrane Fragments by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis or Immunoblotting—In order to enrich for plasma membrane-associated proteins, chondrocytes were harvested after 2 days of culture and cell surface proteins were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were washed two times in PBS to remove amine-containing culture medium and proteins. To 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in PBS 2 mm biotin reagent was added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. To quench and remove excess biotin reagent, 5 ml of PBS + 100 mm glycine was added and the cells were washed twice in PBS. For isolation of membrane fragments the cells were resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm saccharose containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science), lysed by three cycles of freeze/thawing, followed by sonification. After removal of nuclei, mitochondria, and the rough microsomes by centrifugation (1000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the membrane fragments were pelleted by centrifugation (150,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in PBS. Biotinylated membrane fragments were enriched by applying a magnetic separation technique with Magprep™ streptavidin beads (Novagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with subsequent image analysis (ImageQuant; GE Healthcare) or isoelectric focusing (pH 3-10) using the Zoom IPG Runner on zoom stripes pH 3-10 NL (both Invitrogen) in the following sample buffer: 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% ASB-14, 40 mm Tris, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% 3/10 ampholyte, 0.001% bromphenol blue. The isoelectric focusing run was conducted at 4 °C at 200 V for 20 min, at 450 V for 15 min, at 750 V for 15 min, and at 2000 V for 45 min. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was carried out on a 4.5-15% gradient SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Protein standards within a range of 200 to 6.5 kDa (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular mass markers. The gel was stained overnight with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained in HPLC grade A bidest.Mass Spectrometric Analysis—1,25 D3 MARRS receptor was identified by peptide mass fingerprint (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS analysis) and liquid chromatography MS/MS (nano-HPLC and subsequent quantitative time-of-flight electrospray MS/MS analysis) at the Central Bioanalytics Department (ZBA), Center for Molecular Medicine (ZMMK) Cologne, Germany.RESULTSIGF-I-stimulated Late Differentiation of Cranial Cells in Vitro Requires Extracellular Proteinase Activity—In serum-free culture in agarose gels, cranial cells become hypertrophic within 14 days in the presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-I or 25 ng/ml thyroxin. They change their morphology and initiate synthesis of alkaline phosphatase, collagen type X (29Böhme K. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and MMP-13. Newly synthesized radiolabeled collagens II and X after pepsin digestion were identified as characteristic bands migrating with mobilities corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 120 and 58 kDa, respectively, as routinely carried out in several laboratories (1Cancedda R. Descalzi C.F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In developing bone, chondrocytes synthesize this matrix molecule after they have become hypertrophic and before mineralization of the extracellular matrix occurs (1Cancedda R. Descalzi C.F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Cancedda F.D. Dozin B. Quarto R. Int. J. Dev.

Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Linsenmayer T.F. Trelstad R.L. Hayashi M. Anat. Rec. 1991; 229: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine the role of cysteine proteinases during IGF-I-stimulated chondrocyte differentiation, E-64, a specific inhibitor of papain and of other cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin B or L, or cystatin C, a low molecular mass protein of the cystatin superfamily, were added to the cells during the whole culture period. After 14 days the cultures were metabolically labeled with [14C]proline and pepsin-treated collagens were isolated from the cell culture medium and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent fluorography (Fig. 1). In cranial cells stimulated by IGF-I, addition of E-64 dose dependently reduced the production of collagen X, the marker of hypertrophic cells. ∼5 μg/ml of E-64 was sufficient to fully block the secretion of the protein. In parallel, collagen II synthesis was increased (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of cysteine proteinases by cystatin C dose dependently produced similar results (Fig. 1C). To confirm that changes in collagen II and X protein are not due to altered proteolysis or processing but rather are associated with terminal chondrocyte differentiation, gene expression of collagen X and β actin (loading control) was analyzed by one-step RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Collagen X expression is strongly induced after IGF-I stimulation. In the presence of 10 ng/ml cystatin C and IGF-I, however, collagen X expression was strongly diminished. Finally, MMP-13, a metalloproteinase produced by late hypertrophic cells, is another late-stage differentiation marker. The enzyme is essential for degradation of the extracellular matrix of ossifying hypertrophic cartilage prior to mineralization and remodeling into bone. After treatment with IGF-I, MMP-13 was detected in immunoblots as the 60-kDa proenzyme (34Zijlstra A. Aimes R.T. Zhu D. Regazzoni K. Kupriyanova T. Seandel M. Deryugina E.I. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27633-27645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Fig. 1B). In the presence of 5 μg/ml of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64, however, MMP-13 secretion is barely visible on the immunoblots. Taken together, these results showed that cysteine proteinases were required for the production of markers of late differentiation by IGF-I-stimulated chondrocyte and indicated that, in the presence of cysteine proteinase inhibitors, the cells remained at earlier stages of late differentiation.Treatment with E-64 Elevates the Abundance of 1,25 D3 MARRS-binding Protein on the Surface of IGF-I-stimulated Cranial Cells—Because E-64 does not penetrate membranes, cysteine proteinases target components of the culture medium or of the cell surfaces. In a preliminary screen for candidate substrates, proteins on membrane fragments of IGF-I-stimulated cranial cells cultured with or without E-64 were analyzed. In this type of experiments, it was necessary to culture the cells in liquid suspension on top of agarose, a good alternative to suspension culture within agarose gels (1Cancedda R. Descalzi C.F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This allowed easy recovery of the cells after culture. Membrane fragments were prepared from the cells after culture and were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing pH 3-10, SDS-PAGE). Gels stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue revealed a number of differences in the protein patterns (Fig. 2A). A 64-kDa protein with an isoelectric point of ∼5.8 was more abundant in cells cultivated with E-64 (Fig. 2A, arrow). This was in contrast to other proteins on the same gels that produced spots with similar intensities (Fig. 2A, asterisks). The 64-kDa protein was analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting and liquid chromatography MS/MS and was identified as 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor, also known as ERp57/GRp58/ERp60. Alternatively, biotinylated plasma membrane proteins of IGF-I-stimulated cranial cells cultured with or without E-64 were isolated via Magprep™ streptavidin beads and subjected to immunoblotting using AB099 to detect 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor (Fig. 2B). As quantified by image analysis, there was ∼60% more 1,25 D3 MARRS receptor detectable on chondrocyte cell surfaces in the presence of E-64. These results indicated that this membrane-associated vitamin D receptor was a cell surface target of cysteine proteinases and therefore qualified as a candidate attenuator of late differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1986049641,"Microglia are the primary central nervous system immune effector cells. Microglial activation is linked to interactions with extracellular cytokines and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Astrocytomas are characterized by their diffuse nature, which is regulated by insoluble ECM components produced by the tumor cells that are largely absent from normal central nervous system tissue. The present study examined the influence of astrocytoma (C6 rat glioma) insoluble matrix components on interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) induction in microglial cells. We found that IFN-γ-stimulated iNOS induction and nitric oxide release was greater in microglia cultured on C6 glioma cell-derived matrices compared with microglia cultured on primary rat astrocyte-derived matrices. Culture of microglia on C6 glioma cell-derived matrices also led to activation of STAT1, augmentation of IFN-γ-induced STAT-3 activation, and an increase in IFN-γ-activated site (GAS)-luciferase reporter activity. In addition, culture of microglia on C6 glioma cell-derived matrices activated NF-κB DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity. The results suggest that insoluble matrix components derived from malignant glioma cells can regulate microglia activation. These factors may include ECM components, such as fibronectin, collagen, laminin, vitronectin, and other nondiffusible compounds, and laminin seems to a critical regulator of this process. Microglia activation and subsequent brain inflammation may influence tumor growth, treatment, and metastasis. Better understanding of the regulation of microglial activation by astrocytoma-derived insoluble matrix components may be important in the development of immune-based treatment strategies against malignant brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1991763469,"Retinoblastoma-deficient mice show massive neuronal damage and deficits in both CNS and PNS tissue. Previous work in the field has shown that death is regulated through distinct processes where CNS tissue undergoes death regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and the apoptosome component, APAF1. Death in the PNS, however, is independent of p53 and reliant on the death protease, caspase 3. In the present study, we more carefully delineated the common and distinct mechanisms of death regulation by examining the stress-activated kinases, JNK2 and 3, the conserved Bcl-2 member Bax, and the relationship among these elements including p53. By use of genetic modeling, we show that death in various regions of the CNS and DRGs of the PNS is reliant on Bax. In the CNS, Bax acts downstream of p53. The relevance of the JNKs is more complex, however. Surprisingly, JNK3 deficiency by itself does not inhibit c-Jun phosphorylation and instead, aggravates death in both CNS and PNS tissue. However, JNK2/3 double deficiency blocks death due to Rb loss in both the PNS and CNS. Importantly, the relationships between JNKs, p53, and Bax exhibit regional differences. In the medulla region of the hindbrain in the CNS, JNK2/3 deficiency blocks p53 activation. Moreover, Bax deficiency does not affect c-Jun phosphorylation. This indicates that a JNK-p53-Bax pathway is central in the hindbrain. However, in the diencephalon regions of the forebrain (thalamus), Bax deficiency blocks c-Jun activation, indicating that a Bax-JNK pathway of death is more relevant. In the DRGs of the PNS, a third pathway is present. In this case, a JNK-Bax pathway, independent of p53, regulates damage. Accordingly, our results show that a death regulator Bax is common to death in both PNS and CNS tissue.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3402-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this paradigm, neuronal death in the PNS and CNS also appear to be regulated differentially. Death in the CNS is regulated by E2F1 and E2F3, two Rb-regulated transcription factors critical for cell cycle regulation (8Tsai K.Y. Hu Y. Macleod K.F. Crowley D. Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, death in the CNS is entirely dependent upon the tumor suppressor p53 (11Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and Apaf1 (12Guo Z. Yikang S. Yoshida H. Mak T.W. Zacksenhaus E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8395-8400PubMed Google Scholar), a central component of the apoptosome critical for activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Finally, death is not affected by caspase 3 deficiency (13Simpson M.T. MacLaurin J.G. Xu D. Ferguson K.L. Vanderluit J.L. Davoli M.A. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Robertson G.S. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7089-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the CNS, neuronal loss in PNS tissue of Rb-deficient mice is only partially dependent upon E2F1/3 (8Tsai K.Y. Hu Y.

Robertson G.S. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7089-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and independent of p53 (11Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These data suggest that both proximal (e.g. p53) and distal (e.g. caspase 3) effectors of death differ in the CNS and PNS. These findings highlight the important question of the identity(ies) of the central common mechanistic elements between CNS and PNS death in Rb-deficient embryos. As will be discussed in more detail below, Bax is thought to be critical in many forms of neuronal death. Accordingly, we initially hypothesized that the Bcl-2 member, Bax might be the central death regulator. We also postulated that there were different upstream regulators of Bax in the CNS and PNS tissue. In this regard, we examined both p53 and the JNKs, two known upstream regulators of Bcl-2 family members. The Bcl-2 family member Bax has been shown to be central in neuronal death in a number of different paradigms (for example (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In many cases, Bax translocation to the mitochondria leads to release of cytochrome c, concomitant activation of the apoptosome, and in turn, activation of numerous effector caspases. However, Bax does not necessarily mediate death solely through activation of apoptosome. Bax may also regulate apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release from the mitochondria (17Cregan S.P. Fortin A. MacLaurin J.G. Callaghan S.M. Cecconi F. Yu S.W. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Park D.S. Kroemer G. Slack R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). As such, Bax represents a viable candidate to explain the Apaf1-independent death processes observed in the PNS. The factors which lead to activation of Bax are numerous. Of relevance, p53 (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J.

Therefore, Bax could play a central role in mediating both p53/Apaf1-dependent death (as in the CNS) and p53/Apaf1-independent death as might occur in the PNS. JNKs, members of the larger MAPK superfamily, are a family of three (JNK1,2,3) kinases which are activated by multiple stimuli including death inducing insults such as growth factor deprivation, DNA damage, dopaminergic toxins, axotomy, and ischemic insult (18Putcha G.V.

The JNK family members are key activators of the transcription factor c-Jun by phosphorylating c-Jun on Ser63 and Ser73 (31Karin M. J. Biol.

In most cases in neurons, JNK2 and 3 have been primarily associated with death (29Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Yang D.D. Liao G. Schloemer A.J. Dong C. Bao J. Banasiak K.J. Haddad G.G. Flavell R.A.

While the JNK/c-Jun pathway has been shown to regulate activation of Bcl-2 family members such as Bim in models of death that are Bax-dependent, JNKs can also modulate p53 function (37Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell.

A. 1998; 95: 10541-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The interplay between p53, JNK and Bax is therefore likely complex. We presently set out to delineate the potentially critical role of these signals in neuronal death due to Rb deficiency. By use of genetic modeling using Bax- and JNK-deficient mice, we report that death in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of the PNS and various regions of the CNS is Bax-dependent. However, the relationship of JNKs to death is more complex. JNK3 deficiency alone exacerbates death in PNS and CNS tissue. However, JNK2/3 double deficiency is protective. Our data also provide a model by which JNKs act differentially in the CNS. JNKs can regulate both p53 and c-Jun upstream of Bax in the caudal region of the hindbrain (medulla oblongata). However, it can also act downstream of Bax in the diencephalic regions of the forebrain. In the DRGs of the PNS, death is dependent upon JNKs which acts upstream of Bax, independent of p53. Therefore we propose that a common central activator of death, Bax, is regulated by and activates differential upstream and effector signaling pathways in the CNS and PNS tissues of Rb-deficient mice. Transgenic Mice—All transgenic lines were maintained on a C57/Bl6 genetic background. Following interbreeding of various genotypes as described in the text, genotyping was performed by PCR analyses as follows: JNK3 knock-out embryos were genotyped using CCTGCTTCTCAGAAACACCCTTC (MJ3B3), CGTAATCTTGTCCACAGAAATCCCATAC (MJ3F3), and CTCCAGACTGCCTTGGGAAAA (PGKP1) primers in one PCR reaction. JNK2 knock-out embryos were genotyped using GGAGCCCGATAGTATCGAGTTACC (MJ2B3), GTTAGACAATCCCAGAGGTTGTGTG (MJ2F5), and CCAGCTCATTCCTCCACTCATG (PGKT1) in one PCR reaction. Both JNK2 and JNK3 were run under the following PCR conditions: 95 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 95 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min (-1.0 °C/cycle); 72 °C, 1 min (10 cycles); 95 °C, 1 min; 48 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min (20 cycles); 72 °C, 5 min. For JNK2 and JNK3, this reaction amplifies a 270-bp and 250-bp product indicating the targeted allele and a 400-bp and a 430-bp product indicating the wild-type allele, respectively. Bax embryos were genotyped using GTTGACCAGAGTGGCGTAGG (BaxIN5R), GAGCTGATCAGAACCATCATG (BaxEX5F) and CCGCTTCCATTGCTCAGCGG (NEOR) primers under the following PCR conditions: 94 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 1 min; 62 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1.5 min (30 cycles); 72 °C, 7 min. BaxIN5R and BaxEX5F primers were used to amplify a 304-bp product indicating the wild-type allele whereas BaxIN5R and NEOR were used to amplify 504-bp fragment indicating the targeted allele. Rb-deficient transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained on a C57BL6 genetic background. Rb embryos were genotyped using AATTGCGGCCGCATCTGCATCTTTATCGC (RX3), CCCATGTTCGGTCCCTAG (R13), and GAAGAACGAGATCAGCAG (PGK3′) primers in two separate reaction tubes. RX3 and R13 primers were used to amplify the wild-type product and RX3 and PGK3′ primers were used to amplify the targeted allele product under the following conditions: 95 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 minute; 72 °C, 1.5 min (29 cycles). For TUNEL and immunofluorescence analyses, embryos were obtained at E13.5. Tissue samples were obtained for genotyping purposes. The embryos were fixed in 4% PFA/0.1 m phosphate buffer pH 7.4 overnight at 4 °C. The embryos were rinsed using 1× PBS, pH 7.4 (Invitrogen) and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/0.1 m phosphate buffer pH 7.4 overnight at 4 °C. Embryos were equilibrated in a 50:50 mixture of 30% sucrose/OCT (TissueTek 4583) for ∼1 h on a rocking platform. Finally, the embryos were embedded in the same 50:50 mixture and frozen on liquid nitrogen. The embryos were sectioned sagitally at 14 μm on a cryostat. In the Bax/Rb breedings, a subset of embryos was also collected at E18.5 to determine whether survival was enhanced with Bax deficiency. TUNEL Labeling—TUNEL labeling of sections was performed as previously described (13Simpson M.T. MacLaurin J.G. Xu D. Ferguson K.L. Vanderluit J.L. Davoli M.A. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Robertson G.S. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7089-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. Following washing with PBS, sections were permeabilized with 1:1 methanol/acetone mixture for 10 min. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with Hoechst (1:4000 of 0.5 mg/ml soln), and TUNEL reaction was performed for 1 h 37 °C using the terminal transferase kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). TUNEL labeling was visualized by secondary labeling using Cy3-streptavidin (Jackson Laboratories). For quantification, regions of the thalamus in the forebrain, medulla in the hindbrain, trigeminal ganglion and caudal DRGs were quantitated as follows: areas were photographed using Northern Eclipse, Empix Imaging software. Magnification: 20 × 4 × 5 grid set up, positive neurons were counted and compared with their respective Hoechst-positive nuclei. Both TUNEL labeling as well as the total number of Hoechst-positive cells were evaluated. The data are expressed as TUNEL-positive cells/total Hoechst positive cells ± S.E. Statistical significance was analyzed by analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Sections were obtained as described above and immunofluorescence described previously (13Simpson M.T. MacLaurin J.G. Xu D. Ferguson K.L. Vanderluit J.L. Davoli M.A. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Robertson G.S. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7089-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were washed three times in PBS, incubated overnight in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and primary antibody. Primary antibodies utilized were c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technologies, 1:150), phospho-c-Jun Ser73 (Cell Signaling 1:150), and phospho-Ser15 p53 (Cell Signaling, 1:150), Nestin (RDI, 1:400), Active caspase 3 (BD Pharmingen. 1:500), B-III Tubulin (kind gift from D. Brown, 1:50). Following three washes in PBS, sections were incubated in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 solution containing Cy3-conjugated donkey anti rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson, 1:2000). Quantitation was performed similar to that described above for TUNEL analysis. In the case of active caspase 3, total counts were evaluated in relation to a defined region and not to the number of Hoechst cells to facilitate analyses. Bax Deficiency Rescues PNS and CNS Death in Rb-deficient Mice—To determine whether Bax acts as a common mediator of PNS and CNS neuronal death in Rb-deficient neurons, we interbred Bax heterozygous deficient mice with RB heterozygous deficient mice to obtain double heterozygous progeny. These animals were then bred to produce double homozygous-deficient mice. Alternatively, Bax/Rb double heterozygous mice were also interbred with Bax-deficient Rb heterozygous mice. The expected and actual frequencies of genotypes from E13.5 embryos obtained from these crosses are listed in Table 1. The frequencies of embryos were roughly as expected. The majority of the analyses were performed at this age since gross apoptosis in both PNS and CNS is observed at this point prior to embryonic lethality of Rb-deficient mice.TABLE 1Genotype frequency of offspring from all BAXRb interbreedings Two type of breedings were performed. These include double heterozygous crosses as well as breedings of double heterozygous mice with Bax–/–RB+/– mice. Each of these crosses give different expected Mendelian ratios. The expected calculations listed here are ratios of these strategies combined taking into consideration the number of breedings for each strategy.Genotype of offspringExpected frequencyNumber of E13.5 embryosaNumber of embryos, n = 150Frequency%%BAX++ Rb++4.985.3BAX+– Rb++12.52013.3BAX–– Rb++10.474.7BAX++ Rb+–9.82013.3BAX+– Rb+–22.33422.7BAX–– Rb+–12.52416.0BAX++ Rb––4.9138.7BAX+– Rb––15.3117.3BAX–– Rb––7.6138.7a Number of embryos, n = 150 Open table in a new tab As shown in Supplemental Fig. S1, widespread death was observed in a variety of areas of the Rb-deficient CNS as previously reported (3Clarke A.R.

Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Death in the cortex (dorsal telencephalon) ganglionic eminences (ventral telencephalon), thalamus (diencephalon), and pons and medulla of the hindbrain was evident as visualized by TUNEL (data not shown) or staining with active caspase 3 antibody. Active caspase 3 was also observed in these regions in both B-III tubulin-positive (early postmitotic neurons) and -negative regions as shown by double labeling analyses (Supplemental Fig. S1). Active caspase 3 positivity was also widespread in nestin positive (progenitor and early postmitotic) cells (Supplemental Fig. S2). We also examined a select population of neurons using calbinden antibody which detects ventral telencephalon-derived interneurons (Supplemental Fig. S3). In this case, we could not colabel with anticaspase 3 (same antibody species as calbinden) but we instead colocalized with a condensed fragmented hoechst phenotype indicative of damage. Colocalization was observed in a number of regions as stated above. Our results show that widespread cell death occurs in the progenitor (B-III-tubulin negative) and early postmitotic (B-III-tubulin positive) regions of the developing dorsal (cortex) and ventral (lateral and medial ganglionic eminences) telencephalon, diencephalons (thalamus), roof of the midbrain and hindbrain (pons and medulla). In the PNS, death was observed in all DRG ganglia. However, less significant death was observed in superior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic system, suggesting that death in the PNS due to Rb deficiency is more prominent in sensory ganglia (Supplemental Fig. S4). To examine the effect of Bax deficiency on death due to Rb deletion, TUNEL analysis was performed on whole embryo sections of the genotypes described above at E13.5. Because death is widespread, only select regions of the CNS (thalamus of the forebrain, medulla of the hindbrain) were quantified. In addition, because no significant death was observed in SCGs, only sensory ganglia were examined. In this regard, we quantified death in the trigeminal ganglia and caudal DRGs. As shown in Fig. 1, control (double heterozygous, WT heterozygous, or double WT) embryos displayed occasional TUNEL labeling in both PNS and CNS tissues examined. Rb deficiency resulted in massive apoptosis in both tissues examined when compared with control animals. For example, 8% death (TUNEL positivity) was observed in the forebrain (thalamus) and 8.3% in the hindbrain (medulla) regions of the CNS of Rb-deficient mice as compared with 0 and 0.8% death in control animals, respectively (Fig. 2A). Death was also observed by Hoechst analyses where there was significant overlap between TUNEL-positive neurons and condensed nuclei. In the PNS, increased death in the trigeminal ganglion (21 versus 2% control) and rostral DRG nuclei (14 versus 5% in controls) was also evident in Rb-deficient embryos (Fig. 2A). TUNEL labeling in Bax/Rb double-deficient embryos, however, were dramatically reduced in all neuronal populations examined. In the thalamus and medulla regions of the CNS, death was reduced (8.4% Rb-deficient versus 3.3% double-deficient forebrain; (8.3% RB-deficient versus 2.3% double-deficient hindbrain). Similar reductions were also observed in the PNS (20.8 versus 5.3% in trigeminal and 13.8 versus 4.8% in rostral DRGs). It is important to note that Bax deficiency appeared to affect death in both B-III tubulin positive early neuronal and negative progenitor regions. For example, in the dorsal cortex and midbrain regions where the distinction between B-III tubulin-positive and -negative areas are the most defined, we observed that active caspase 3 was reduced in both tubulin-positive and -negative regions (Fig. 2B) with Bax/Rb double-deficient embryos. This was not the case with JNK3 deficiency, which is not protective against death due to Rb loss as described below.FIGURE 2Effects of Bax deficiency on Rb deficiency induced damage in CNS and PNS nervous tissue. Sagittal sections (as described in the legend for Fig. 1) were stained for TUNEL.

Accordingly, the number of Bax/Rb double-deficient embryos was analyzed at E18.5. However no viable Rb-deficient animals were found at this age (n = 39). Previous evidence has indicated that p53 is induced in the CNS of Rb-deficient mice (11Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, cell death in this region is dependent upon p53 since p53/Rb double-deficient mice show less death when compared with Rb-deficient mice alone (11Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next determined whether Bax may inhibit p53 activation or whether protection mediated by Bax would leave the p53 response intact. The latter would be expected if p53 acted upstream of Bax. As shown in Fig. 3, active phosphorylated p53 was detected utilizing a phosphospecific phosphoSer15 p53 antibody. Modification at this site has been associated with increased stabilization/activation of p53. Phosphoryl"

We have made a variant of aerolysin, R336A, that has greatly reduced the ability to bind to GPI-AP, and as a result it is only very weakly active. Fusion of interleukin 2 (IL2) to the N terminus of R336A-aerolysin results in a hybrid that has little or no activity against cells that do not have an IL2 receptor because it cannot bind to the GPI-AP on the cells. Strikingly, the presence of the IL2 moiety allows this hybrid to bind to cells displaying high affinity IL2 receptors. Once bound, the hybrid molecules form insertion-competent oligomers. Cell death occurs at picomolar concentrations of the hybrid, whereas the same cells are insensitive to much higher concentrations of R336A-aerolysin lacking the IL2 domain. The targeted channel-forming hybrid protein may have important advantages as a therapeutic agent.

Strikingly, the presence of the IL2 moiety allows this hybrid to bind to cells displaying high affinity IL2 receptors. Once bound, the hybrid molecules form insertion-competent oligomers. Cell death occurs at picomolar concentrations of the hybrid, whereas the same cells are insensitive to much higher concentrations of R336A-aerolysin lacking the IL2 domain. The targeted channel-forming hybrid protein may have important advantages as a therapeutic agent. The possibility that cancer cells can be selectively killed by targeted protein toxins has been explored for many years (for reviews see Refs. 1Li Z. Yu T. Zhao P. Ma J. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2005; 2: 106-112PubMed Google Scholar and 2Wong L. Suh D.Y. Frankel A.E. Semin. Oncol. 2005; 32: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Beginning in the 1980s, studies were conducted with protein synthesis-inactivating toxins, mainly Pseudomonas exotoxin, diphtheria toxin, and ricin, targeted to specific cell types by attaching specific antibodies or antibody fragments or by attaching growth factors such as interleukin 2 (IL2). 2The abbreviations used are: IL2interleukin 2GPI-APglycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein(s)IL4interleukin 4PAproaerolysinuPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolHBSHEPES-buffered salineSSsignal sequenceMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidfwdforwardrevreversehhuman. Several of these hybrid toxins have shown some efficacy in targeted cancer treatment. One of the first of these was created by fusing IL2 to a truncated version of diphtheria toxin (3Williams D.P. Parker K. Bacha P. Bishai W. Borowski M. Genbauffe F. Strom T.B. Murphy J.R. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The truncated toxin lacks the normal diphtheria toxin receptor-binding site, so that the hybrid cannot bind to normal cells. An IL2-DT hybrid, called denileukin diftitox, has been approved for treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, whose malignant cells display the CD25 component of the IL2 receptor (4Uchiyama T. Broder S. Waldmann T.A. J.

Aerolysin is a channel-forming toxin that is capable of killing mammalian cells at picomolar concentrations. The protein is secreted as an inactive protoxin called proaerolysin by Aeromonas spp. (5Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wong K.R.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structure of proaerolysin has been solved, and the mechanism by which it causes cell death is well understood (8Rossjohn J. Feil J.C. Mckinstry W.J. Tsernoglou D. van der Goot G. Buckley J.T.

Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Proaerolysin binds with high affinity to the glycosyl anchor of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-AP), which are widely distributed on the surfaces of mammalian cells (11Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance binding studies using proaerolysin variants indicate that the high affinity binding site for the ligand is located at one end of the large lobe of proaerolysin (13Mackenzie C.R. Hirama T. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies indicated that Arg-336 was a critical residue in binding as we found that the aerolysin variant R336A was completely unable to lyse erythrocytes. Either before or after it has bound to the receptor, proaerolysin can be converted to aerolysin by proteolytic removal of a C-terminal fragment. This can be accomplished by a number of proteases but perhaps most importantly by furin and related proteases (14Abrami L. Fivaz M. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Jean F. Thomas G. Leppla S. Buckley J.T. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32656-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which are transiently exposed on many mammalian cell surfaces. Aerolysin formed in solution by soluble proteases can bind to surface receptors with the same affinity as proaerolysin. Once on the cell surface, aerolysin oligomerizes to form heptamers that insert into the cell membrane, creating channels that cause cell death (15van der Goot F.G. Pattus F. Wong K. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Insertion is likely accompanied by a change in the conformation of the oligomer that allows it to penetrate and remain in the lipid bilayer (16Rossjohn J. Raja S.M. Nelson K.L. Feil S.C. van der Goot F.G. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Cabiaux V. Buckley J.T. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Aerolysin may have several advantages as a component of molecules targeted to cancer cells. Production problems are likely to be minimal, as proaerolysin is a remarkably stable molecule that can be made safely in very high yield, but perhaps more importantly, the cell killing mechanism should minimize any possibility of a bystander effect. Thus once the oligomer has entered the cell membrane and killed the cell, it is unable to move to the membrane of another cell. This is because oligomer membrane entry is likely to be irreversible (19Melton J.A. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14315-14322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another advantage offered by aerolysin is that it can potentially be made specific for a cancer cell, not only by adding a specific targeting agent but also by modifying the protein so that is activated by a protease associated with a specific cell type. We have already replaced the amino acid sequence where furin activates proaerolysin with a sequence that is cleaved by the proteolytic activity of prostate-specific antigen, creating a protoxin that is activated when injected into the prostate (20Williams S.A. Merchant R.F. Garrett-Mayer E. Isaacs I.T. Buckley J.T. Denmeade S.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2007; 99: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This engineered toxin is currently the subject of a Phase I clinical trial for localized recurrent prostate cancer. Here we provide evidence that aerolysin can be targeted to cells displaying the IL2 receptor, by first modifying the protoxin so that it does not bind to GPI-AP, which are displayed on most or all mammalian cells, and by then fusing the modified toxin to IL2. The resulting hybrid is a new kind of targeted toxin that may be useful in cancer therapy. Reagents—Media for the propagation of mammalian cell lines, TaqDNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and primers were from Invitrogen; T-STIM with concanavalin A was from BD Biosciences; restriction nucleases and Deep Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kits were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); and QIAquick gel extraction kits (for purification of fragments from agarose gels) and QIAprep spin miniprep kits (for plasmid purification) were from Qiagen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Cell Lines—All cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The CTLL-2 mouse cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% T-STIM with concanavalin A or with 100 units/ml of human recombinant IL2. The EL-4 mouse cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum. The HuT-78 human cell line was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. The Ramos and IARC 301 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Sodium pyruvate was also present in the Ramos growth medium. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli was normally grown in LB media containing the appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C. Aeromonas salmonicida was grown in LB media supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose and Davis salts (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

The gene for PA encoding six histidines at the C terminus of the protein was prepared by inserting six codons (CAT) at the 3′-end of the gene by two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit, two pairs of primers (EndHis1fwd, GCTGCCAATCAACATCATCATTAACGGCAGCGC, and EndHis1rev, GCGCTGCCGTTAAATGATGATGTTGATTGGCAGC; and EndHis2fwd, GCCAATCAACATCATCATCATCATCATTAACGGCAGCGC, and EndHis2rev, GCGCTGCCGTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTGATTGGC, respectively), and the wild type aerA gene cloned in pTZ18U cloning vector as a template. The resulting plasmid was named pPA-H6. To accommodate the codon usage for Aeromonas sp., two GGA codons for Gly (Gly-27 and Gly-88) in the gene coding for IL2 were changed to GGC, which is preferred by Aeromonas. Two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis were performed using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit, two pairs of primers (Gly-27fwd, CTGGATTTACAGATGATTTTGAATGGCATTAATAATTACAAGAATCCC, and Gly-27rev, GGGATTCTTGTAATTATTAATGCCATTCAAAATCATCTGTAAATCCAGC; Gly-88fwd, GTTCTGGAACTAAAGGGCTCTGAAACAACATTCATGTGTG, Gly-88rev, TTCACACATGAATGTTGTTTCAGAGCCCTTTAGTTCCAGAAC) and plasmid pGEM1 containing the gene for human interleukin 2 (hIL2) as a template according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting plasmid was named pNIL2. The DNA fragment containing the gene for hIL2 (amino acids 2–131), with a sequence encoding the 3′-end of the signal sequence (SS) of aerolysin at the 5′-end and a sequence encoding a six amino acid linker (SGRSAQ), which could be cleaved by uPA at the 3′-end, was prepared by PCR1 using the primers PSLfwd, CAAGCGGCAGAGCCTACTTCAAGTTC, and UPArev, TTGAGCACTACGGCCTGATGTTGAGATGATGC, with the plasmid pNIL2 as a template. The DNA fragment containing the sequence for the SS of aerolysin with the part of hIL2 gene at the 3′-end was prepared by PCR2 using the primers pUCfwd, GGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC (upstream from HindIII site in the vector pTZ18U), and PSLrev, ACTTGAAGTAGGCTCTGCCGCTTGC, with the plasmid pPA-H6 as a template. The DNA fragment encoding the signal sequence of aerolysin fused to the gene coding hIL2 (with the uPA linker at the 3′-end) was prepared by recombinant PCR (PCR3), using the primers pUCfwd and UPArev, and the products of PCR1 and PCR2 as a template. The DNA fragment containing the gene for PA with the uPA linker attached to its 5′-end was prepared by PCR4 using the primers UPAfwd, TCAGGCCGTAGTGCTCAAGCAGACCCCGTCTATCC, and pUCrev, GGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATG (downstream from EcoRI site in pTZ18U), with the plasmid pPA-H6 as a template. The whole recombinant gene SS-IL2-uPA-PA-H6 was prepared by recombinant PCR (PCR5) with the primers pUCfwd and pUCrev, using the products of PCR3 and PCR4 as a template. The product of PCR5 was cleaved with the restriction endonucleases HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into the cloning vector pTZ18U cut with the same enzymes. After the sequence of the gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing, the gene was cloned into the broad host range expression vector pMMB66HE (22Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) using HindIII and EcoRI and moved into A. salmonicida CB3 by conjugation using the filter-mating technique described by Harayama et al. (23Harayama S. Tsuda M. Lino T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 180: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA manipulations were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—The R336A variants of the proteins were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with the pair of primers R336Afwd, CACCCGGACAACGCACCGAACTGGAACCAC, and R336Arev, GTGGTTCCAGTTCGGTGCGTTGTCCGGGTG, and the corresponding wild type PA gene cloned in the vector pTZ18U as a template. After the sequence of the mutated gene had been confirmed by DNA sequencing, the gene was cloned into the broad host range expression vector pMMB66HE (using HindIII and EcoRI) and moved into A. salmonicida CB3 by conjugation using the filter-mating technique (23Harayama S. Tsuda M. Lino T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 180: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Proaerolysin—Both native proaerolysin and R336A proaerolysin were expressed in A. salmonicida CB3 and purified from the bacterial culture supernatant as described previously (25Buckley J.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of IL2 Hybrids—The two IL2 hybrids were expressed in 400 ml of CB3 IL2-uPA-PA-H6::66 or CB3 IL2-uPA-R336A-H6::66 (starting A600 nm 0.7, final A600 nm 5–6) by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction followed by shaking overnight at 250 rpm and 27 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg/ml DNase, 10 μg/ml RNase, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The IL2 hybrid was released from the cells by French pressing 3–4 times at 800 p.s.i. to form a cell lysate that was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C. Half of the clarified cell lysate was separated by fast protein liquid-chromatography nickel affinity chromatography using a 10-ml chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column at room temperature. The fast protein liquid chromatography program used two buffers as follows: buffer A, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4; and buffer B, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The cell lysate was loaded onto the column equilibrated in buffer A, and the column was washed with 100 ml of 10% buffer B (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). Elution was achieved using a gradient of 10–60% buffer B. The peak fractions were pooled and loaded onto a 60-ml macro-prep ceramic hydroxyapatite type 1 40-μm column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated at 4 °C in 20 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Each of the IL2 hybrids was eluted using a linear gradient of 20–200 mm KH2PO4 in 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Protein concentrations were estimated by absorbance at 280 nm. Hemolytic Titers—Hemolytic titers were performed at 37 °C using a final concentration of 0.4% (v/v) horse red blood cells in HBS. The toxin samples (3.5 μg) were pretreated with one of the following proteases: 20 units/ml furin (Sigma) in HBS, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 37 °C; 0.04 mg/ml urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in HBS for 4 h, or 0.1 mg/ml trypsin in HBS for 10 min at room temperature. Controls were incubated in HBS for 10 min at room temperature without the addition of protease. All digestions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm final concentration) and cooled on ice. For each proaerolysin variant, a volume of reaction mixture containing 3 μg of toxin was transferred to the first well in the first column of a 96-well titer plate (two plates were used). The volume of the well was brought to 200 μl with HBS. Each sample was serially diluted 1:1 across the plate. Readings were taken after 1 h at 37 °C. Results are expressed in units representing the largest dilution causing complete cell lysis. Cell Killing Assays—Killing assays were carried out using cell lines prepared at concentrations of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Each assay was carried out in triplicate. Using 96-well titer plates, each of the proteins was serially diluted 1:5 in supplemented cell media using a final volume of 20 μl. After serial dilution, cells were added to appropriate rows to a final volume of 100 μl. Two control rows were used; the first contained no toxin and no cells, and the second contained no toxin with cells. The cells were then preincubated with the toxins for 1 h at 37 °C, under 5% CO2 with humidity before adding 20 μl of cell killing reagent (Promega CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay). This was followed by a further incubation for 4 h under the same conditions. The plates were then read using a BioTec plate reader at 490 nm. Cell killing curves were generated by plotting the calculated average percent cell viability for each well against the respective toxin concentration. For IL4 replacement cell killing assays, 200 units/ml mouse IL4 (BioVision) were added to each well prior to toxin dilutions. Similarly, human recombinant IL2 was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for IL2 competition cell killing assays. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). EL4 and CTLL-2 cells were prepared in unsupplemented cell culture media to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Toxin was added to cells at 2 × 10-8 m, and the mixtures were incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed three times in unsupplemented media and resuspended to the original volume. Rabbit anti-aerolysin polyclonal antiserum was added at a 1:500 dilution, and each mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, and then the cells were washed and resuspended as above. The secondary antibody, a polyclonal goat α-rabbit IgG H+L chain-specific fluorescein conjugate (Calbiochem), was added at a 1:5000 dilution, and the mixtures were incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed and resuspended once again as above and readings were taken. Histograms were prepared using Cellquest software. Oligomerization Study—The oligomerization study was performed by incubating PA or R336A at 0.08 mg/ml with 0.002 mg/ml trypsin for 20 min at 37 °C. Trypsin inhibitor was then added to 0.1 mg/ml, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Samples in 1× Sample Buffer (NuPAGE) were loaded onto a NuPAGE 10% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) in 1× MOPS-SDS running buffer under nonreduced conditions and run for 50 min at 200 V constant voltage. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The cell killing oligomerization study was performed by incubating CTLL-2 cells in cell culture media with each of the specified proaerolysin constructs for 5 h. After incubation, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in sample buffer (NuPAGE), and the samples were electrophoresed using 10% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) in 1× MOPS-SDS buffer under nonreduced conditions. Aerolysin monomers and oligomers were detected by Western blotting using an anti-aerolysin monoclonal antibody. Purification of PA and Hybrid Variants—Proaerolysin and R336A-proaerolysin (R336A-PA) were both secreted into the culture supernatant of A. salmonicida, and both were purified as we have described previously. Neither of the IL2 containing hybrids was secreted by the bacteria, presumably because the IL2 moiety prevented transfer of the proteins across the outer membrane. The two hybrid proteins were purified from the soluble fraction after French pressing and centrifugation. All of the purified proteins migrated as single major bands of expected apparent mass upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Binding of R336A-PA to Lymphocytes—We have previously shown using flow cytometry that native proaerolysin binds well to EL4 cells, which display GPI-anchored Thy-1 in high copy number, as well as other GPI-anchored proteins (26Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Residue Arg-336 is in a region that we have shown is involved in proaerolysin binding to GPI-AP. The results in Fig. 2 compare the binding of native proaerolysin and the R336A variant to EL4 cells. As predicted from our earlier studies on proaerolysin variants containing mutations in the same region of the molecule (13Mackenzie C.R. Hirama T. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and consistent with our observation that the variant was inactive against erythrocytes, R336A-PA was not able to bind to EL4 cells. Proteolytic Processing of PA and Hybrid Variants—Native proaerolysin is converted to aerolysin by proteolytic removal of ∼40 residues from the C terminus (the actual number removed depends on the protease used). Once formed, aerolysin is resistant to further proteolysis (27Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 336-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3 show that both PA and R336-PA were converted to a form corresponding in mass to aerolysin by treatment with trypsin, uPA, or furin. This was not surprising because the binding variant and PA have the same amino acid sequence in the activation loop. Trypsin and uPA also converted IL2-PA and IL2-R336A-PA to aerolysin, producing a band corresponding in mass to IL2 in the process. Thus both of these enzymes could cut at the six amino acid linker joining IL2 to PA, as well as within the PA C-terminal activation sequence. In contrast, furin converted the IL2 proaerolysin hybrids each to the IL2-aerolysin form but did not separate the IL2 from the aerolysin. This was not surprising, because the linker peptide between the two parts of the hybrid does not contain a sequence recognized by furin. There was no evidence that the IL2 was degraded by any of these proteases, before or after it was released from the hybrids, indicating that it was correctly folded. Hemolytic Activity of Processed PA and Hybrid Variants—Mammalian erythrocytes lack proteases that can convert proaerolysin to aerolysin, and as a result they are unaffected by the protoxin. The results in Table 2 show that treatment of native PA with trypsin, furin, or uPA converted it to hemolytically active aerolysin, consistent with the results in Fig. 5. The results in Table 2 also show that R336A-aerolysin, formed from R336A-PA by any of the three proteases or from IL2-R336A-PA by uPA or trypsin, was incapable of lysing erythrocytes, presumably because it cannot bind to the cells. The results in Table 2 also show that IL2-aerolysin, produced by treatment of IL2-PA with furin (Fig. 3), had some ability to lyse erythrocytes. This indicates that the presence of the IL2 moiety does not prevent the formation of a channel-forming oligomer.TABLE 2Hemolytic titers of PA constructs Hemolytic titers were performed at 37 °C using a final concentration of 0.4% (v/v) horse red blood cells in HBS. The toxin samples were pretreated with furin, uPA, or trypsin and titered as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ToxinProteaseNoneTrypsinFurinUrokinasePA012812864R336A-PA0444IL2-uPA-PA03248IL2-uPA-R336A-PA0200 Open table in a new tab Oligomerization of R336A-PA and Native PA—We next considered the possibility that the R336A mutation in proaerolysin might not only prevent the protein from binding to GPI-AP but might also prevent R336A-aerolysin from oligomerizing. Oligomers normally form on the target cell surface, after proaerolysin is concentrated there by receptor binding and converted to aerolysin by proteolytic nicking. It is the oligomeric form of the toxin that is insertion-competent and that forms membrane channels (15van der Goot F.G. Pattus F. Wong K. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Aerolysin oligomers are very stable, and they can be detected by SDS-PAGE. To investigate the possibility that the R336A mutation affected the ability of the protein to oligomerize as well as to bind, we compared the ability of the R336A-PA variant to oligomerize with the oligomerization ability of native proaerolysin using a method we have described previously (15van der Goot F.G. Pattus F. Wong K. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein at a high concentration was converted to the aerolysin form by trypsin; trypsin inhibitor was added, and incubation was continued to allow oligomerization to occur. The oligomers were then detected by SDS-PAGE. The results in Fig. 4 show that native PA and R336A-PA formed similar amounts of oligomer, confirming that the variant is able to oligomerize. Binding to Mammalian Cells—We next measured binding of our constructs to five cell lines using flow cytometry. Constructs that contain the native GPI-anchor-binding site of proaerolysin should bind to cells displaying these receptors, and constructs with the IL2 domain should bind to cells with high affinity IL2 receptor complexes. High affinity binding of IL2 requires the presence of both the α and β subunits of the receptor. All of the cell types we tested display GPI-AP on their surfaces, but they vary in the types and numbers of the IL2 receptor subunits they display. Unactivated EL4 cells do not have IL2 receptor α subunits (28Minami J. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-268Crossref PubMed Google Sch"
