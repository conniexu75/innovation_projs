The structure of the cytoplasmic-open state is known, but it has proved difficult to understand the transport mechanism in the absence of a structure in the matrix-open state. Here, we describe the structure of the matrix-open state locked by bongkrekic acid bound in the ADP/ATP-binding site at the bottom of the central cavity. The cytoplasmic side of the carrier is closed by conserved hydrophobic residues, and a salt bridge network, braced by tyrosines. Glycine and small amino acid residues allow close-packing of helices on the matrix side. Uniquely, the carrier switches between states by rotation of its three domains about a fulcrum provided by the substrate-binding site. Because these features are highly conserved, this mechanism is likely to apply to the whole mitochondrial carrier family.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIyZDY5NGFkZWRlNjczNTBiOTA1ZTkzOTdjNGY5NTZhYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3Nzc4MjExfQ.IvZShGyxm5Q2RFyitu71gI9IJ6NLUtdMI9XFXYHx2EwqylXPpAS8rnab2BpCVId3jt7FCUx5L2qovLhVh2kriKpRAk5VbgbQpKaEnJJmGq0O557iDjcDJ1rkIFyTq37gAMMsVxqtp-n0wLgEM39yuj2K16u644ftKNjcMqDdJeBdhxnia3bKUMwtywUvL5rJQRY9pLjHBfUGCbg9iNM5fzzFH9YIWAHQbw0WE_hR29s7FHrHqkawY7C5iDsEhGwnaA-1HkUJoM6rie1l45t4ZOkulTqVZiAacnWqFAXFstEnGihvF3ucIcBnYjqT3QlqOnrAPJ7w2vwxhF9kROptyQ(mp4, (26.27 MB) Download video Mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers transport ADP into the mitochondrial matrix for ATP synthesis, and ATP out to fuel the cell, by cycling between cytoplasmic-open and matrix-open states.

Uniquely, the carrier switches between states by rotation of its three domains about a fulcrum provided by the substrate-binding site. Because these features are highly conserved, this mechanism is likely to apply to the whole mitochondrial carrier family. Solute transport across the impermeable mitochondrial inner membrane is essential for the function and survival of eukaryotic cells. The majority of these transport steps are catalyzed by membrane proteins of the mitochondrial carrier family (Monné and Palmieri, 2014Monné M. Palmieri F. Antiporters of the mitochondrial carrier family.Curr. Top. Membr. 2014; 73: 289-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The archetypal member of the family, the ADP/ATP carrier, performs the vital role of transporting ADP into the mitochondrial matrix and ATP out of the mitochondrion to maintain high cytosolic ATP concentrations for energy-requiring reactions (Kunji et al., 2016Kunji E.R. Aleksandrova A. King M.S. Majd H. Ashton V.L. Cerson E. Springett R. Kibalchenko M. Tavoulari S. Crichton P.G. Ruprecht J.J. The transport mechanism of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 2379-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Every day, this carrier transports our own body weight in ADP and ATP, recycling each ATP molecule more than a thousand times. The carrier cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state), which can be trapped by the membrane-impermeable toxic inhibitor carboxyatractyloside (CATR) (Vignais et al., 1973Vignais P.V.

Nature of the receptor site for carboxyatractyloside (gummiferin).Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1508-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the matrix-open state (m-state), which is locked by the membrane-permeable bongkrekic acid (BKA) (Erdelt et al., 1972Erdelt H.

BKA is a polyunsaturated methoxy tricarboxylic acid polyketide produced by Burkholderia gladioli pathological variant cocovenenans (de Bruijn et al., 1973de Bruijn J.D. Frost D.J. Nugteren D.H.

Over 2,000 cases of human fatality from BKA poisoning have been reported in Indonesia, China, and Mozambique since 1950, due to contamination of corn or coconut products (tempe bongkrek) (Anwar et al., 2017Anwar M.

Mitochondrial carriers consist of three homologous sequence repeats of about 100 amino acids (Saraste and Walker, 1982Saraste M. Walker J.E. Internal sequence repeats and the path of polypeptide in mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase.FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which form a 3-fold pseudosymmetrical structure with the translocation path through the center of the molecule (Kunji and Harding, 2003Kunji E.R. Harding M. Projection structure of the atractyloside-inhibited mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36985-36988Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The first atomic structure of the CATR-inhibited bovine ADP/ATP carrier (Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Structure of mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in complex with carboxyatractyloside.Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) was followed by those of yeast ADP/ATP carriers in the same state (Ruprecht et al., 2014Ruprecht J.J. Hellawell A.M. Harding M. Crichton P.G. McCoy A.J. Kunji E.R. Structures of yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers support a domain-based alternating-access transport mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E426-E434Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Each sequence repeat forms a domain, comprising an odd-numbered transmembrane helix (H1, H3, or H5), a loop containing a short matrix helix lying parallel to the membrane (h12, h34, or h56), and an even-numbered transmembrane helix (H2, H4, or H6) (Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Structure of mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in complex with carboxyatractyloside.Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal region of each odd-numbered transmembrane helix, a conserved signature motif Px[DE]xx[KR] is found (Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Structure of mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in complex with carboxyatractyloside.Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The proline residues of this motif are located at pronounced kinks in the odd-numbered helices, giving them an L-shape. Consequently, these helices come together on the matrix side, where the charged residues of the three motifs form the matrix salt bridge network, closing the central cavity to the mitochondrial matrix in the c-state (Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Structure of mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in complex with carboxyatractyloside.Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Nucleotides are among the largest solutes to cross biological membranes, yet mitochondrial carrier proteins are relatively small. Transport must therefore involve profound conformational changes, which nevertheless must prevent proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Until now, the molecular mechanism by which mitochondrial carriers transport has not been established. However, some sequence features required for a transport mechanism have been identified. First, a consensus substrate-binding site has been proposed in the central cavity (Dehez et al., 2008Dehez F. Pebay-Peyroula E. Chipot C. Binding of ADP in the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier is driven by an electrostatic funnel.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 12725-12733Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Robinson and Kunji, 2006Robinson A.J. Kunji E.R.

Electrostatic funneling of substrate in mitochondrial inner membrane carriers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9598-9603Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Second, a conserved motif [YF][DE]xx[KR] was identified on the even-numbered helices, the charged residues of which likely form a cytoplasmic salt bridge network in the m-state (King et al., 2016King M.S. Kerr M. Crichton P.G. Springett R. Kunji E.R.S. Formation of a cytoplasmic salt bridge network in the matrix state is a fundamental step in the transport mechanism of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.Biochim. Biophys.

USA. 2014; 111: E426-E434Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that substrate binding leads to the interconversion of states by disruption and formation of the cytoplasmic and matrix salt bridge networks, opening and closing the carrier to either side of the membrane (Kunji et al., 2016Kunji E.R. Aleksandrova A. King M.S. Majd H. Ashton V.L. Cerson E. Springett R. Kibalchenko M. Tavoulari S. Crichton P.G. Ruprecht J.J. The transport mechanism of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.Biochim.

USA. 2014; 111: E426-E434Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here, we have determined the structure of the ADP/ATP carrier inhibited by BKA, which represents the first structure of a carrier in an m-state conformation and reveals the molecular mechanism of transport utilized by mitochondrial carrier proteins. Mitochondrial carriers are highly dynamic proteins, and the m-state is known to be unstable in detergent solution (Crichton et al., 2015Crichton P.G. Lee Y. Ruprecht J.J. Cerson E. Thangaratnarajah C. King M.S. Kunji E.R. Trends in thermostability provide information on the nature of substrate, inhibitor, and lipid interactions with mitochondrial carriers.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 8206-8217Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which has hampered structure determination. To solve these problems, we targeted the BKA-inhibited ADP/ATP carrier from the moderately thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila (TtAac, Figure S1), carrying a single mutation (Q302K) in the cytoplasmic network that increases the thermal stability (King et al., 2016King M.S. Kerr M. Crichton P.G. Springett R. Kunji E.R.S. Formation of a cytoplasmic salt bridge network in the matrix state is a fundamental step in the transport mechanism of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1857: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we selected a nanobody against this state and crystallized the complex (see STAR Methods for details). TtAac has 75% sequence identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ScAac2 and ScAac3 and 51% sequence identity to bovine Aac1p, the structures of which have been determined in the CATR-inhibited state (Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003Pebay-Peyroula E.

The crystal is composed of alternating layers of carrier and nanobody molecules, with crystal contacts between the carrier layers being mediated by the nanobodies (Figure S2). The carrier consists of six transmembrane helices surrounding a central cavity (Figure 1). The structural fold has the characteristic three-domain structure of this protein family (Figure 1B). The matrix salt-bridge network (E37, K40, D142, R145, D242, and R245) and cytoplasmic salt-bridge network (D101, K104, D205, K208, D299, and K302) flank the proposed central substrate-binding site (K30, R88, G192, I193, Y196, S238, and R287) (Figure 1C). The carrier binds one molecule of BKA and several cardiolipin molecules, which bind to positively charged pockets due to the N-terminal dipoles of the matrix and even-numbered transmembrane helices (Figure S3).Figure 1Overall Structure of the Bongkrekic Acid-Inhibited ADP/ATP CarrierShow full caption(A) The structure of TtAac (rainbow cartoon) bound to bongkrekic acid (ball-and-stick with orange carbons) and a nanobody (Nb, wheat cartoon).

Comparison of the BKA-inhibited carrier structure with the CATR-inhibited c-state structure of the homologous S. cerevisiae ADP/ATP carrier Aac2p (ScAac2, PDB: 4C9H) reveals a profound conformational change (Figure 2). The BKA-inhibited m-state has a central cavity open to the mitochondrial matrix side of the membrane, with the matrix helices rotated outward (Figures 1 and 2). In the m-state, the cavity is closed to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane by a cluster of residues that includes those of the cytoplasmic salt bridge network (Figures 1C and S4). In the c-state, which is open to the cytoplasmic side, the cytoplasmic network residues are far apart, whereas the matrix salt bridge network residues are interacting, helping to close the carrier on the matrix side (Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003Pebay-Peyroula E.

USA. 2014; 111: E426-E434Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Solvent accessibility calculations map out the geometry of the central cavity in both states and reveal that each state has an ∼15 Å thick gate, closing off access to the central cavity from one side of the membrane and thus preventing proton leak (Figures 2A and 2B). The consensus residues of the proposed substrate-binding site (Kunji et al., 2016Kunji E.R. Aleksandrova A. King M.S. Majd H. Ashton V.L. Cerson E. Springett R. Kibalchenko M. Tavoulari S.

Acta. 2016; 1863: 2379-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which we confirm are essential for the function of TtAac (Figure S5), are accessible for substrate binding in both states. This observation provides structural support for the single-binding center gated pore hypothesis (Klingenberg, 1979Klingenberg M. The ADP,ATP shuttle of the mitochondrion.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 249-252Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which is essentially an alternating access model (Jardetzky, 1966Jardetzky O. Simple allosteric model for membrane pumps.Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Comparing surface representations shows the dramatically different shapes of the two states (Figures 2C–2F). Viewed from the matrix side, the m-state has a strong positively charged central cavity around the substrate-binding site, primed for binding negatively charged ATP (Figure 2C), whereas access to the cavity is closed in the c-state with a predominantly neutral surface (Figure 2D). Viewed from the intermembrane space, the cavity is closed in the m-state, with a predominantly neutral surface, except for a small positively charged patch (Figure 2E), whereas a positively charged cavity is visible in the c-state (Figure 2F).Figure S4Alignment of Symmetry-Related Triplets from Yeast and Human Carrier Sequences, Related to Figures 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6Show full caption(A) The odd-numbered helices and (B) even-numbered helices of different mitochondrial carriers of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), Homo sapiens (Hs), Musculus musculus (Mm), and Aspergillus oryzae (Ao).

The structure reveals that in the m-state, the charged residues of the cytoplasmic salt bridge network, part of the conserved [YF][DE]xx[KR] motif (Figure S4), come into close proximity and form electrostatic interactions, linking the even-numbered transmembrane helices of each domain (Figure 3A) in agreement with functional data (King et al., 2016King M.S.

We identify a deleterious UBQLN4 mutation in families with an autosomal recessive syndrome reminiscent of genome instability disorders. UBQLN4 deficiency leads to increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress and delayed DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN4 is phosphorylated by ATM and interacts with ubiquitylated MRE11 to mediate early steps of homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair (HRR). Loss of UBQLN4 leads to chromatin retention of MRE11, promoting non-physiological HRR activity in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, UBQLN4 overexpression represses HRR and favors non-homologous end joining. Moreover, we find UBQLN4 overexpressed in aggressive tumors. In line with an HRR defect in these tumors, UBQLN4 overexpression is associated with PARP1 inhibitor sensitivity. UBQLN4 therefore curtails HRR activity through removal of MRE11 from damaged chromatin and thus offers a therapeutic window for PARP1 inhibitor treatment in UBQLN4-overexpressing tumors.

In response to genotoxic stress, cells activate a signaling network, collectively referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR activates cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair pathways, and, if damage is beyond repair capacity, triggers cell-death pathways (Reinhardt and Yaffe, 2013Reinhardt H.C. Yaffe M.B. Phospho-Ser/Thr-binding domains: Navigating the cell cycle and DNA damage response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the DDR is primarily activated by the proximal kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which phosphorylates a plethora of substrates, such as KAP-1, CHK2, p53, MRE11, RAD50, NBS1, and others (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. The ATM protein kinase: Regulating the cellular response to genotoxic stress, and more.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 197-210Crossref Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The main DSB repair pathways are the canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) pathway and homologous recombination repair (HRR). Error-prone c-NHEJ operates throughout the cell cycle and directly ligates the processed DSB ends, whereas error-free HRR is restricted to late S and G2, when a repair template is available (Dietlein et al., 2014Dietlein F. Thelen L. Reinhardt H.C. Cancer-specific defects in DNA repair pathways as targets for personalized therapeutic approaches.Trends Genet. 2014; 30: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Additional mutagenic DSB repair pathways are alternative NHEJ and single-strand annealing (Dietlein et al., 2014Dietlein F. Thelen L. Reinhardt H.C. Cancer-specific defects in DNA repair pathways as targets for personalized therapeutic approaches.Trends Genet. 2014; 30: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The balance between these different pathways is essential for correct DSB repair (Dietlein et al., 2014Dietlein F. Thelen L. Reinhardt H.C. Cancer-specific defects in DNA repair pathways as targets for personalized therapeutic approaches.Trends Genet. 2014; 30: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wealth of phosphorylation targets in the DDR, the number of known ubiquitylation substrates at DSB sites is small (Harding and Greenberg, 2016Harding S.M. Greenberg R.A. Choreographing the double strand break response: Ubiquitin and SUMO control of nuclear architecture.Front. Genet. 2016; 7: 103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). While K63-linked ubiquitylation mediates functional alterations of the target protein, K48-linked ubiquitin chains mark target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation (Walczak et al., 2012Walczak H. Iwai K. Dikic I. Generation and physiological roles of linear ubiquitin chains.BMC Biol. 2012; 10: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Notably, we previously observed recruitment of proteasomes to DSB sites (Levy-Barda et al., 2011Levy-Barda A. Lerenthal Y. Davis A.J. Chung Y.M. Essers J. Shao Z. van Vliet N. Chen D.J. Hu M.C. Kanaar R. et al.Involvement of the nuclear proteasome activator PA28γ in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 4300-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the regulated turnover of proteins at DSB sites may be critical for a proper DSB response. In proteasome-mediated protein degradation, ubiquitylated proteins are recognized by specific proteasome subunits (Grice and Nathan, 2016Grice G.L. Nathan J.A. The recognition of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Additional selectivity is provided by loosely associated shuttle factors that mediate target recognition by the proteasome. Three such shuttles were identified in budding yeast: Dsk2, Rad23, and Ddi1 (Hartmann-Petersen et al., 2003Hartmann-Petersen R. Seeger M. Gordon C. Transferring substrates to the 26S proteasome.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 26-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Rad23 and Ddi1 have been implicated in the DDR, as Rad23 functions in nucleotide excision repair (Ng et al., 2003Ng J.M. Vermeulen W. van der Horst G.T. Bergink S. Sugasawa K. Vrieling H. Hoeijmakers J.H. A novel regulation mechanism of DNA repair by damage-induced and RAD23-dependent stabilization of xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1630-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and Ddi1 is required in the proteasomal degradation of homothallic switching (HO) endonuclease, which generates a site-specific DSB at the mating type locus (Kaplun et al., 2005Kaplun L. Tzirkin R. Bakhrat A. Shabek N. Ivantsiv Y. Raveh D. The DNA damage-inducible UbL-UbA protein Ddi1 participates in Mec1-mediated degradation of Ho endonuclease.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mammalian orthologs of Dsk2 are members of the ubiquilin family, ubiquilin1–4 (UBQLN1–4) (Hu et al., 2012Hu Y. Park K.K. Yang L. Wei X. Yang Q. Cho K.S. Thielen P. Lee A.H. Cartoni R. Glimcher L.H. et al.Differential effects of unfolded protein response pathways on axon injury-induced death of retinal ganglion cells.Neuron. 2012; 73: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ubiquilins contain ubiquitin-like (UBL) and ubiquitin-binding (UBA) domains. Their role as shuttles that direct cargo to the proteasome is mediated by the binding of ubiquitylated proteins through their UBA domain and simultaneous interaction with the proteasome subunit s5a through their UBL domain (Ko et al., 2004Ko H.S. Uehara T. Tsuruma K. Nomura Y. Ubiquilin interacts with ubiquitylated proteins and proteasome through its ubiquitin-associated and ubiquitin-like domains.FEBS Lett. 2004; 566: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here, we identify a homozygous UBQLN4 germline mutation, p.R326X, in a complex inherited disorder. Affected patients display characteristics similar to other genome instability syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia and others (Hoeijmakers, 2001Hoeijmakers J.H. Genome maintenance mechanisms for preventing cancer.Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, we show that UBQLN4 is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner and recruited to sites of DNA damage, where it redirects DSB repair toward NHEJ by functionally repressing HRR. We further show that UBQLN4 interacts with ubiquitylated MRE11, to facilitate its proteasomal degradation. Moreover, reduced HRR usage in UBQLN4-overexpressing tumor cells is associated with an actionable PARP1 inhibitor sensitivity. We identified an autosomal recessive syndrome in two consanguineous families (Figures 1A and 1B ). Two patients (A-IV-4, B-IV-3) were followed from birth to 10 and 11 years of age, respectively. Patient A-IV-3 was a stillbirth and was hence not followed further. These patients displayed intellectual impairment, growth retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, hearing loss, ataxia, and anemia. Moreover, a pregnancy in family A was terminated at the end of the first trimester due to polyhydramnios, nuchal translucency, and single umbilical artery (fetus A-IV-5). A detailed clinical description of the patients is provided in Figures 1A, 1B, and S2 and Table S1 and the Human subjects section within the STAR Methods. We performed whole-exome sequencing of cells isolated from A-IV-4 and A-IV-5. This analysis revealed a detrimental homozygous c.976C > T mutation in exon 6 of the UBQLN4 gene in both patients (Figure S1A; Table S2). This mutation is predicted to create a premature stop codon (p.R326X) (Figure 1C). Sanger sequencing confirmed c.976C > T homozygosity in the affected individuals, while the parents were heterozygous carriers (Figures 1C and S1B). Of note, out of a total of 8 shared homozygous variants, the UBQLN4 c.976C > T mutation was the only shared aberration predicted to be truncating (Figure S1A; Table S2).Figure S1Homozygous c.976C > T Mutation in the UBQLN4 Gene Leads to UBQLN4 Deficiency Syndrome, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Number of variants remaining after each filtering step.(B) Genomic sequencing of lymphocyte DNA obtained from a healthy control, patient B-IV-3, and carriers B-III-2 and B-III-3.

To investigate whether the c.976C > T mutation affects UBQLN4 expression, we performed immunoblots. We analyzed dermal fibroblasts (DMFs) derived from B-IV-3, A-IV-5, and B-III-2 using antibodies directed against C- and N-terminal UBQLN4 epitopes. Neither of these antibodies detected full-length UBQLN4 in cells from B-IV-3 or A-IV-5, while DMFs derived from B-III-2 showed reduced UBQLN4 expression, compared to wild-type (WT) (Figures 1D and S1C). We note that the N-terminal antibody detected a faint unspecific band in WT cells below the full-length UBQLN4 band that was also seen in patient-derived cells (Figure S1C). To rule out the possibility of a transcript variant that skips the c.976C > T mutation in exon 6, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The expressed allelic fraction of the p.R326X mutation was 100% in both patients (Figure 1E). In addition, A-IV-5 and B-IV-3 showed a low-level expression of a novel transcript containing an exon 5–7 splice junction, omitting exon 6 (Figure 1E). However, exon 6 skipping leads to a frameshifted transcript, predicted to contain a downstream stop codon (p.L321X), potentially giving rise to a 321-amino-acid protein, which was not detected in patient cells (Figure 1D). Of note, patient cells, and to a lesser extent parent cells, showed on average an almost 3-fold decrease in UBQLN4 mRNA expression, compared to WT samples of the same cell type (Figure S1D), indicating that the mutant transcripts may be subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Our data indicate that the c.976C > T mutation creates a UBQLN4-null allele, leading to a novel autosomal recessive syndrome in homozygotes, which we term “UBQLN4 deficiency syndrome.” We recently conducted an RNAi screen in conjunction with automated microscopy, using ATM-dependent KAP-1 phosphorylation as a readout (Figure S1E) (Baranes-Bachar et al., 2018Baranes-Bachar K. Levy-Barda A. Oehler J. Reid D.A. Soria-Bretones I. Voss T.C. Chung D. Park Y. Liu C. Yoon J.B. Li W. Dellaire G. Misteli T. Huertas P. Rothenberg E. Ramadan K. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y.

Cell. 2018; 69: 866-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Re-analysis of these experiments revealed sustained KAP-1 phosphorylation in UBQLN4-depleted cells after treatment with the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin (NCS), suggesting delayed DNA repair in the absence of UBQLN4 (Figure S1F). Thus, we next examined the response of cells derived from patient B-IV-3 to genotoxic stress. Patient and WT DMFs were treated with NCS, etoposide, cisplatin, or hydroxyurea (HU). Consistent with a role of UBQLN4 in the DDR, UBQLN4 mutant cells exhibited a significantly increased sensitivity to all four genotoxic agents, compared to WT (Figures 2A–2D). Heterozygous cells showed NCS, etoposide, and HU sensitivities, between those of patient and WT cells (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D). Cisplatin sensitivity was similar in the patient and heterozygous cells (Figure 2C). Complementation of patient cells with UBQLN4wt reverted the hypersensitivity to all four genotoxic agents (Figures S3A–S3E). Furthermore, RNAi-mediated UBQLN4 depletion rendered U2OS cells significantly more sensitive against NCS, compared to controls in clonogenic survival assays (Figures S3F and S3G). Of note, ATM inhibition with KU60019 had a slightly more pronounced effect on NCS sensitization than UBQLN4 depletion (Figures S3F and S3G). Next, we quantified DNA damage-induced apoptosis in U2OS cells expressing either two distinct UBQLN4-depleting short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), or a control hairpin (Figure S3F). When cells were treated with NCS, etoposide, cisplatin, or HU, UBQLN4-depleted cells displayed a significantly increased cleaved-caspase-3 (CC3)-positive population in response to all four genotoxic agents, compared to controls (Figures 2E–2H). These results suggest that loss of UBQLN4 confers hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and leads to enhanced apoptotic cell death in response to DNA damage.Figure S3Loss of UBQLN4 Increases Cellular Sensitivity to Genotoxic Agents, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Immunoblot displaying the expression level of UBQLN4 of cell lines used in (B-E).

In response to NCS and etoposide, we observed a significantly delayed clearance of γH2AX foci in patient and heterozygous cells, compared to WT (Figures 2J and 2K). Of note, UBQLN4 depletion in U2OS cells resulted in a similarly delayed clearance of NCS-induced γH2AX foci, compared to controls (Figure S3H). In contrast to the etoposide and NCS response, cells treated with cisplatin and HU showed a continuous increase of γH2AX foci throughout the 48-hr observation period (Figures 2L–2M). In line with defective DNA repair in UBQLN4-deficient settings, patient and heterozygous cells displayed a significantly increased number of γH2AX foci following cisplatin and HU exposure, compared to WT (Figures 2L–2M). We observed a massive accumulation of γH2AX foci in late S-phase, specifically in cisplatin-treated UBQLN4 mutant cells, compared to WT (Figure S3I). Moreover, the decrease in cell counts induced by each of the genotoxic agents was significantly enhanced in patient cells, and to a lesser extent in heterozygous cells, compared to WT (Figure S3J). In line with the experiments shown in Figure S3B, re-expression of ectopic UBQLN4 rescued the number of surviving UBQLN4 mutant cells after NCS treatment (Figure S3K). To determine the impact of UBQLN4 depletion on the sealing of NCS-induced DSBs, we performed neutral comet assays in U2OS cells expressing two distinct UBQLN4-targeting shRNAs or a control shRNA. Of note, alkaline comet assays do not differentiate between single-strand break and DSB, whereas the neutral comet assay specifically reports DSBs (Olive and Banáth, 2006Olive P.L. Banáth J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2907363328,"Many large carnivore populations are expanding into human-modified landscapes and the subsequent increase in coexistence between humans and large carnivores may intensify various types of conflicts. A proactive management approach is critical to successful mitigation of such conflicts. The Cantabrian Mountains in Northern Spain are home to the last remaining native brown bear (Ursus arctos) population of the Iberian Peninsula, which is also amongst the most severely threatened European populations, with an important core group residing in the province of Asturias. There are indications that this small population is demographically expanding its range. The identification of the potential areas of brown bear range expansion is crucial to facilitate proactive conservation and management strategies towards promoting a further recovery of this small and isolated population. Here, we used a presence-only based maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach to model habitat suitability and identify the areas in the Asturian portion of the Cantabrian Mountains that are likely to be occupied in the future by this endangered brown bear population following its range expansion. We used different spatial scales to identify brown bear range suitability according to different environmental, topographic, climatic and human impact variables. Our models mainly show that: (1) 4977 km2 are still available as suitable areas for bear range expansion, which represents nearly half of the territory of Asturias; (2) most of the suitable areas in the western part of the province are already occupied (77% of identified areas, 2820 km2), 41.4% of them occurring inside protected areas, which leaves relatively limited good areas for further expansion in this part of the province, although there might be more suitable areas in surrounding provinces; and (3) in the eastern sector of the Asturian Cantabrian Mountains, 62% (2155 km2) of the land was classified as suitable, and this part of the province hosts 44.3% of the total area identified as suitable areas for range expansion. Our results further highlight the importance of increasing: (a) the connectivity between the currently occupied western part of Asturias and the areas of potential range expansion in the eastern parts of the province; and (b) the protection of the eastern sector of the Cantabrian Mountains, where most of the future population expansion may be expected."
https://openalex.org/W2907402149,"Crowdfunding has gained traction as a mechanism to raise resources for entrepreneurial and artistic projects, yet there is little systematic evidence on the potential of crowdfunding for scientific research. We first briefly review prior research on crowdfunding and give an overview of dedicated platforms for crowdfunding research. We then analyze data from over 700 campaigns on the largest dedicated platform, Experiment.com. Our descriptive analysis provides insights regarding the creators seeking funding, the projects they are seeking funding for, and the campaigns themselves. We then examine how these characteristics relate to fundraising success. The findings highlight important differences between crowdfunding and traditional funding mechanisms for research, including high use by students and other junior investigators but also relatively small project size. Students and junior investigators are more likely to succeed than senior scientists, and women have higher success rates than men. Conventional signals of quality–including scientists’ prior publications–have little relationship with funding success, suggesting that the crowd may apply different decision criteria than traditional funding agencies. Our results highlight significant opportunities for crowdfunding in the context of science while also pointing towards unique challenges. We relate our findings to research on the economics of science and on crowdfunding, and we discuss connections with other emerging mechanisms to involve the public in scientific research."
https://openalex.org/W2906735970,"Extracellular vesicle (EV) microRNAs are of major interest as potential diagnostic biomarkers in all cancer types. This study aims to identify miRNA profiles of shed microvesicles (sMVs) and exosomes (Exos) secreted from the isogenic colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines SW480 and SW620 and evaluate their ability to predict CRC. Deep sequencing of miRNAs in parental cell lysates (CLs) and highly-purified sMVs and Exos was performed. We focused on miRNAs enriched in EVs and dysregulated miRNAs in metastatic cells (SW620) relative to primary cancer cells (SW480). We investigated the ability of EV miRNA signatures to predict CRC tumours using 594 tumours (representing different pathological stages) and 11 normal samples obtained from TCGA. In SW480 and SW620 cells we identified 345 miRNAs, of which 61 and 73 were upregulated and downregulated in SW620-CLs compared to SW480-CLs, respectively. Selective distribution of cellular miRNAs into EVs results in distinct miRNA signatures for sMVs and Exos in each cell line. Cross cell line comparisons of EV miRNA profiles reveal a subset of miRNAs critical in CRC progression from primary carcinoma to metastasis. Many miRNAs non-detectable (<5 TPM) in CLs were significantly enriched (>1000 TPM) in secreted EVs. Strikingly, miR-7641 which is non-detectable in SW480-CL but upregulated in SW620-CL is highly enriched in EVs secreted from both cell lines. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that EV miRNA profiles can be used to predict CRC tumours with ~96% accuracy. Our findings suggest that EV miRNA profiles from CRC cell lines may allow prediction of CRC tumours, and that miR-7641 may serve as an attractive candidate for the specific, non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of CRC."

The correction algorithm is based on two steps; estimation of the scattering component and correction using an enhanced normalization formula. The method incorporates correction terms into the image normalization procedure, which usually only includes open beam and dark current images (open beam correction). Our aim is to show its efficiency and reproducibility: we detail the data treatment procedures and quantitatively investigate the effect of the correction. Its implementation is included within the open source CT reconstruction software MuhRec. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using simulated and experimental CT datasets acquired at the ICON and NEUTRA beamlines at the Paul Scherrer Institut."

Increased ECM synthesis and secretion in response to TGFβ is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). TGFβ and UPR signaling pathways are tightly intertwined during HSC activation, but the regulatory mechanism that connects these two pathways is poorly understood. Here, we found that TGFβ treatment of immortalized HSCs (i.e. LX-2 cells) induces phosphorylation of the UPR sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) in a SMAD2/3-procollagen I–dependent manner. We further show that IRE1α mediates HSC activation downstream of TGFβ and that its role depends on activation of a signaling cascade involving apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). ASK1–JNK signaling promoted phosphorylation of the UPR-associated transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which is crucial for TGFβ- or IRE1α-mediated LX-2 activation. Pharmacological inhibition of C/EBPβ expression with the antiviral drug adefovir dipivoxil attenuated TGFβ-mediated activation of LX-2 or primary rat HSCs in vitro and hepatic fibrogenesis in vivo. Finally, we identified a critical relationship between C/EBPβ and the transcriptional regulator p300 during HSC activation. p300 knockdown disrupted TGFβ- or UPR-induced HSC activation, and pharmacological inhibition of the C/EBPβ–p300 complex decreased TGFβ-induced HSC activation. These results indicate that TGFβ-induced IRE1α signaling is critical for HSC activation through a C/EBPβ-p300–dependent mechanism and suggest C/EBPβ as a druggable target for managing fibrosis.

https://openalex.org/W2907733456,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), including heparan sulfates and chondroitin sulfates, are major components of the extracellular matrix. Upon interacting with heparin binding growth factors (HBGF), GAGs participate to the maintaintenance of tissue homeostasis and contribute to self-healing. Although several processes regulated by HBGF are altered in Alzheimer’s disease, it is unknown whether the brain GAG capacities to bind and regulate the function of HBGF or of other heparin binding proteins, as tau, are modified in this disease. Here, we show that total sulfated GAGs from hippocampus of Alzheimer’s disease have altered capacities to bind and potentiate the activities of growth factors including FGF-2, VEGF, and BDNF while their capacity to bind to tau is remarkable increased. Alterations of GAG structures and capacities to interact with and regulate the activity of heparin binding proteins might contribute to impaired tissue homeostasis in the Alzheimer’s disease brain."
https://openalex.org/W2906954017,"Seminal plasma is a key biological fluid that modulates sperm function in the reproduction process. However, its role in sperm biotechnologies is scarce in poultry. The aims of the present study were to study the amino acids profile and total proteins of seminal plasma in 12 Spanish chicken breeds and to investigate the role of seminal plasma on cryoresistance of rooster sperm. To investigate the role of seminal plasma on cryoresistance, diluted pooled semen samples were cryopreserved in the presence and absence of seminal plasma. Glutamic acid was the most abundant free amino acid in seminal plasma, followed by alanine, serine, valine, and glycine. There was an influence of breed (P<0.05) on the percentage of viable sperm after freezing-thawing of samples with seminal plasma. Cluster analysis revealed that White Prat, Black Castellana, Blue Andaluza, Quail Castellana, and Red-Barred Vasca returned the best freezing-thawing response (good freezers). There was a positive correlation between seminal plasma concentrations of valine, isoleucine lysine, leucine and post thaw viability. The evaluation of fertilization capacity of frozen-thawed semen from the breeds White Prat (‘good freezer’) and Black-Red Andaluza (‘bad freezer’) showed that good freezer had higher fertility (20/68, 29.4%) compared to bad freezer breed (14/76, 18.4%), even if the difference was not significant (P = 0.08). The TUNEL assay revealed that freezing/thawing procedures in presence of seminal plasma provoked higher DNA fragmentation in most of the breeds, with a positive correlation between seminal alanine, valine, isoleucine, methionine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine concentrations and DNA integrity. DNA fragmentation was lower in absence of seminal plasma and the breed effect on sperm viability was highly reduced. It is concluded that specific seminal plasma amino acids were associated with post-thaw percentage of viable sperm and DNA integrity. The removal of seminal plasma decreases the variability of the results and DNA fragmentation damages."
https://openalex.org/W2906973346,"We measured the atmospheric emission rates of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in two wastewater treatment plants in Southwest Germany, which apply different treatment technologies. Dissolved gas concentrations and fluxes were measured during all processing steps as well as in the discharge receiving streams. N2O isotopocule analysis revealed that NH2OH oxidation during nitrification contributed 86–96% of the N2O production in the nitrification tank, whereas microbial denitrification was the main production pathway in the denitrification tank in a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system. During wastewater treatment using a modified Ludzack-Ettinger system (MLE) with energy recovery, N2O was predominantly produced by the NO2- reduction by nitrifier-denitrification process. For both systems, N2O emissions were low, with emission factors of 0.008% and 0.001% for the MLE and the CAS system, respectively. In the effluent-receiving streams, bacterial denitrification and nitrification contributed nearly equally to N2O production. The CH4 emission from the MLE system was estimated as 118.1 g-C d-1, which corresponds to an emission factor of 0.004%, and was three times lower than the emission from the CAS system with 0.01%."
https://openalex.org/W2907699911,"BAF complexes are composed of different subunits with varying functional and developmental roles, although many subunits have not been examined in depth. Here we show that the Baf45 subunit Dpf2 maintains pluripotency and ESC differentiation potential. Dpf2 co-occupies enhancers with Oct4, Sox2, p300, and the BAF subunit Brg1, and deleting Dpf2 perturbs ESC self-renewal, induces repression of Tbx3, and impairs mesendodermal differentiation without dramatically altering Brg1 localization. Mesendodermal differentiation can be rescued by restoring Tbx3 expression, whose distal enhancer is positively regulated by Dpf2-dependent H3K27ac maintenance and recruitment of pluripotency TFs and Brg1. In contrast, the PRC2 subunit Eed binds an intragenic Tbx3 enhancer to oppose Dpf2-dependent Tbx3 expression and mesendodermal differentiation. The PRC2 subunit Ezh2 likewise opposes Dpf2-dependent differentiation through a distinct mechanism involving Nanog repression. Together, these findings delineate distinct mechanistic roles for specific BAF and PRC2 subunits during ESC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2908110142,"Reversible switching between opaque and translucent colony formation is a novel feature of Acinetobacter baumannii that has been associated with variations in the cell morphology, surface motility, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance and virulence. Here, we assessed a number of phenotypic alterations related to colony switching in A. baumannii clinical isolates belonging to different multi-locus sequence types. Our findings demonstrated that these phenotypic alterations were mostly strain-specific. In general, the translucent subpopulations of A. baumannii produced more dense biofilms, were more piliated, and released larger amounts of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). In addition, the translucent subpopulations caused reduced fertility of Caenorhabditis elegans. When assessed for effects on the immune response in RAW 264.7 macrophages, the OMVs isolated from opaque subpopulations of A. baumannii appeared to be more immunogenic than the OMVs from the translucent form. However, also the OMVs from the translucent subpopulations had the potential to evoke an immune response. Therefore, we suggest that OMVs may be considered for development of new immunotherapeutic treatments against A. baumannii infections."
https://openalex.org/W2907404714,"Previous studies, including our own, have reported that spermatozoa isolated from the testis have remarkably higher occurrence of aneuploidy once isolated from azoospermic men. This notion, however, did not translate into a lower pregnancy rate nor a greater proportion of miscarriages. Indeed, ICSI offspring generated from surgically retrieved gametes did not suffer from increased karyotypic aneuploidy than children generated from ejaculated specimens. In recent years, aneuploidy assessments on a larger number of cells and utilizing more chromosome probes have reported a progressive decrease in chromosomal aberrations in spermatozoa directly retrieved from the seminiferous tubules. In light of the availability of more accurate molecular genetic techniques, we have decided to challenge the notion that sampling epididymal and testicular tissues yields spermatozoa with higher incidence of aneuploidy than those retrieved in the ejaculate. In a retrospective manner, we have carried out an analysis by FISH with 9 chromosome probes on at least 1000 cells from the ejaculates of 87 consenting men and the specimens of 6 azoospermic men, while spermatozoa of fertile donors were used as control. Aneuploidy by FISH yielded 0.9% for the donor control but rose in the study group to 3.6% in the ejaculated, 1.2% for the epididymal, and 1.1% for testicular spermatozoa. There were no differences in autosomal or gonosomal disomies, nor nullisomies. In this group, once the specimens of these men were used for ICSI, ejaculated spermatozoa yielded a 22% clinical pregnancy rate that resulted in 62.5% pregnancy loss. The surgically retrieved specimens yielded a 50% clinical pregnancy rate that progressed to term. To confirm our findings, in a prospective analysis, DNA sequencing was carried out on the ejaculates and surgical samples of 22 men with various spermatogenic characteristics. In this comparison, the findings were similar with actually a higher incidence of aneuploidy in the ejaculated spermatozoa (n = 16) compared to those surgically retrieved (n = 6) (P<0.0001). For this group, the clinical pregnancy rate for the ejaculated specimens was 47.2% with 29.4% pregnancy loss, while the surgically retrieved yielded a 50% clinical pregnancy rate, all progressing to term. A subsequent prospective combined assessment on ejaculated and surgically retrieved spermatozoa by FISH and NGS was performed on non-azoospermic men with high DNA fragmentation in their ejaculate. The assessment by FISH evidenced 2.8% chromosomal defects in the ejaculated and 1.2% in testicular biopsies while by NGS became 8.4% and 1.3% (P = 0.02), respectively. Interestingly, we evidenced a pregnancy rate of 0% with ejaculated while 100% with the testicular spermatozoa in this latter group. This indicates that improved techniques for assessing sperm aneuploidy on a wider number of cells disproves earlier reports and corroborates the safe utilization of testicular spermatozoa with a positive impact on chances of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2908102740,"Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels in widespread use in neuroscience for mediating the genetically targetable optical control of neurons (optogenetics). ChRs pass multiple kinds of ions, and although nonspecific ChR-mediated conductance is not an issue in many neuroscience studies, conductance of calcium and protons, which can mediate diverse cellular signals, may be undesirable in some instances. Here, we turned our attention to the creation of ChRs that have high cation photocurrent but pass fewer calcium ions and protons. We developed an automated, time-resolved screening method capable of rapidly phenotyping channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) variants. We found substitution mutations throughout ChR2 that could boost current while altering ion selectivity and observed that the mutations that reduced calcium or proton conductance have additive effects. By combining four mutations, we obtained a ChR, ChromeQ, with improved photocurrent that possesses order-of-magnitude reductions in calcium and proton conductance and high fidelity in driving repetitive action potentials in neurons. The approach presented here offers a viable pathway toward customization of complex physiological properties of optogenetic tools. We propose that our screening method not only enables elucidation of new ChR variants that affect microbial opsin performance but may also reveal new principles of optogenetic protein engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2906681422,"Purpose To evaluate the long-term cumulative probability of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation with the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (IDI) when used to treat different indications: diabetic macular edema, uveitis, retinal vein occlusion. Methods 705 IDI injections (429 eyes) were assessed and Kaplan-Meier graphs were generated to assess: the probability of different levels of IOP elevation (IOP≥21, ≥25 or ≥35 mmHg), IOP change ≥10 mmHg, initiation of IOP-lowering treatment, glaucoma surgery, IOP change with repeat injections and IOP elevation in eyes with glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT). Results The cumulative probability of IOP ≥21, ≥25 and ≥35 mmHg was 50%-60%, 25%-30% and 6%-7% at 12–24 months, respectively. The probability of initiating IOP-lowering medication was 31%-54% at 12–24 months. Glaucoma and OHT eyes had a higher probability of mild IOP elevation (≥21 mmHg, 65.1%, 75% and 57.8%, p = 0.01), yet a similar moderate (≥25 mmHg, 22.3%, 28% and 30.2%, p = 0.91) and severe elevation of IOP (≥35 mmHg, 3.7%, 7.1% and 4%, p = 0.71) as normal eyes. Glaucoma surgery was required in only 0.9% cases (4/429). At baseline, 8.8% of the treated eyes had glaucoma, 6.7% OHT and 16.9% were already on IOP-lowering medication. Conclusions In the long-term (24 months), IOP elevation is common, generally mild (30% IOP, ≥25 mmHg) and well-tolerated, resolving with topical treatment (54%) and rarely requiring surgery (0.9%)."
https://openalex.org/W2898786477,"Social judgments of faces made by Western participants are thought to be underpinned by two dimensions: valence and dominance. Because some research suggests that Western and Eastern participants process faces differently, the two-dimensional model of face evaluation may not necessarily apply to judgments of faces by Eastern participants. Here we used a data-driven approach to investigate the components underlying social judgments of Chinese faces by Chinese participants. Analyses showed that social judgments of Chinese faces by Chinese participants are partly underpinned by a general approachability dimension similar to the valence dimension previously found to underpin Western participants’ evaluations of White faces. However, we found that a general capability dimension, rather than a dominance dimension, contributed to Chinese participants’ evaluations of Chinese faces. Thus, our findings present evidence for both cultural similarities and cultural differences in social evaluations of faces. Importantly, the dimension that explained most of the variance in Chinese participants’ social judgments of faces was strikingly similar to the valence dimension previously reported for Western participants."
https://openalex.org/W2906820124,"Immuno-PCR (iPCR) is one of the methods used for the detection of a wide range of analytes and features the high sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. iPCR uses antibodies coupled to DNA, followed by the amplification of the attached DNA using RT-PCR. Two major types of antibody-DNA conjugates are currently used, which are obtained as a result of non-covalent (biotin-streptavidin) or covalent interactions. Using a strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), we synthesized covalent DNA-antibody conjugates, optimized the reaction conditions, and developed an efficient protocol for the purification of conjugates, with which all unreacted antibodies and oligonucleotides are separated. Covalent DNA-antibody conjugates were tested with iPCR assays that were previously developed for the detection of IgE and IgM antibodies with the use of the supramolecular complex of 5'- and 3'-biotinylated DNA and streptavidin. The results show that the modification of antibodies with amino groups did not allow us to obtain monolabeled antibodies or antibodies with a strictly defined number of DNA-labels. The degree of labeling determined by the dyes introduced through the azido group reflects the actual labeling degree statistically. If the average labeling degree for azido groups is 1.1, the conjugates contain 25% mono-labeled antibodies, 50% double-labeled antibodies, and 25% unlabeled ones. The specificity of the monoclonal antibody to human IgE (BE5) changed after conjugation with the oligonucleotide. The sensitivity of iPCR in the detection of IgM antibodies produced against the LeC disaccharide using a covalent conjugate was similar to that of a supramolecular complex of 5'- and 3'-biotinylated DNA and streptavidin, but the new procedure is two steps shorter."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an applied SMF could induce biological effects on growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and then to probe biochemical and bio-molecular responses. We found a decrease in growth and viability under SMF (250mT) after 6h with a significant decrease in colony forming units followed by an increase between 6 h and 9 h. Moreover, measurements of antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase) demonstrated a particular profile suggesting oxidative stress. For instance, SOD and catalase activities increased in magnetized cultures after 9 h compared with unexposed samples. However, SMF exposure caused a decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity. Finally, SMF caused an increase in MDA levels as well as the content of protein carbonyl groups after 6 and 9 h of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2907825968,"Epidermal ceramides are indispensable lipids that maintain the functions of the stratum corneum. Esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine (EOS) ceramide with a linoleate moiety is one of the most important ceramide species for forming cornified lipid envelopes. This linoleate moiety is eventually metabolized to trihydroxy-linoleic acid (triol, 9,10,13-trihydroxy-11E-octadecenoic acid). Thus, we assumed that a decrease of triols might reflect skin barrier dysfunction. Against this background, the purposes of this study were to measure the triols by a simple tape-stripping method and to determine the correlation between the amount of triols and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator of barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis patients. Twenty Japanese subjects with normal skin and 20 atopic dermatitis patients were enrolled in this study. TEWL was measured and triols of the stratum corneum were analyzed by tape-stripping. The results showed for the first time that triols in the stratum corneum could be simply measured using the tape-stripping method. The triol levels in atopic dermatitis patients were much higher than those in healthy subjects. Moreover, the triol levels correlated with TEWL of non-lesional forearm skin in patients with atopic dermatitis. The results suggest that the assaying of triol levels via non-invasive tape-stripping could be beneficial for monitoring barrier function in atopic dermatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2907412917,"Education may encourage personal and collective responses to climate change, but climate education has proven surprisingly difficult and complex. Self-perception of knowledge and intelligence represent one factor that may impact willingness to learn about climate change. We explored this possibility with a case study in Raleigh, North Carolina in 2015 (n = 200). Our goal was to test how gender and ethnicity influenced perceptions people had of their own climate change knowledge. Survey respondents were asked how strongly they agreed with the statement “I feel knowledgeable about climate change” (1 = strongly disagree, and 5 = strongly agree). Our survey instrument also included demographic questions about race, age, income, gender, and education, as well as respondent’s experience with natural disasters and drought. We observed an interaction between education and gender where women’s self-perceived knowledge was higher than men among people with low levels of educational attainment, but was higher for men than women among people with high levels of educational attainment. In addition, minority respondents self-reported lower perceived climate change knowledge than white respondents, regardless of educational attainment. This study enhances our understanding of the gender gap in self-perceptions of climate knowledge by suggesting it is contingent on educational attainment. This could be the result of stereotype-threat experienced by women and minorities, and exacerbated by educational systems. Because people who question their knowledge are often more able to learn, particularly in ideologically charged contexts, highly educated women and minorities may be more successful learning about climate change than white men."
https://openalex.org/W2908322050,"VqmA is a highly conserved transcriptional regulator of the quorum-sensing system of Vibrio cholerae, a major human pathogen that continues to imperil human health. VqmA represses biofilm formation and plays an important role in V. cholerae pathogenicity in the human host. Although VqmA's biological function is well understood, the molecular mechanisms by which its specific ligand (and effector), 3,5-dimethylpyrazine-2-ol (DPO), controls transcription of the target gene, vqmR, remain obscure. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of DPO binding, we used structural analyses and biochemical assays to study the V. cholerae VqmA–DPO–DNA complex. These analyses revealed that VqmA contains an N-terminal homodimer domain (PAS) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD). We observed that VqmA directly binds to a DPO molecule via a compact hydrophobic pocket, consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and several α-helices. We also found that the VqmA dimer interacts with the quasi-palindromic sequence of the vqmR promoter through its DBD. The results of the biochemical studies indicated that a water atom and VqmA residues Phe-67 and Lys-101 play a key role in effector recognition, which is also assisted by Tyr-36 and Phe-99. This is the first molecular level view of the VqmA dimer bound to DPO and DNA. The structure–function analyses presented here improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms in the transcriptional regulation of VqmA in Vibrio spp. and may inform the design of drugs to manage V. cholerae infections."
https://openalex.org/W2907458383,"Background The HIV cascade is an important framework for assessing systems of care, but population-based assessment is lacking for most jurisdictions worldwide. We measured cascade indicators over time in a population-based cohort of diagnosed people living with HIV (PLWH) in Ontario, Canada. Methods We created a retrospective cohort of diagnosed PLWH using a centralized laboratory database with HIV diagnostic and viral load (VL) test records linked at the individual-level. Individuals enter the cohort with record of a nominal HIV-positive diagnostic test or VL test, and remain unless administratively lost to follow-up (LTFU, >2 consecutive years with no VL test and no VL test in later years). We calculated the annual percent of diagnosed PLWH (cohort individuals not LTFU) between 2000 and 2015 who were in care (≥1 VL test), on ART (as documented on VL test requisition) or virally suppressed (<200 copies/ml). We also calculated time from diagnosis to linkage to care and viral suppression among individuals newly diagnosed with HIV. Analyses were stratified by sex and age. Upper/lower bounds were calculated using alternative indicator definitions. Results The number of diagnosed PLWH increased from 8,859 (8,859–11,389) in 2000 to 16,110 (16,110–17,423) in 2015. Over this 16-year period, the percent of diagnosed PLWH who were: in care increased from 81% (63–81%) to 87% (81–87%), on ART increased from 55% (34–60%) to 81% (70–82%) and virally suppressed increased from 41% (23–46%) to 80% (67–81%). Between 2000 and 2014, the percent of newly diagnosed individuals who linked to care within three months of diagnosis or achieved viral suppression within six months of diagnosis increased from 67% to 82% and from 22% to 42%, respectively. Estimates were generally lower for females and younger individuals. Discussion HIV cascade indicators among diagnosed PLWH in Ontario improved between 2000 and 2015, but gaps still remain—particularly for younger individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2907792792,"The default-mode network (DMN) comprises a set of brain regions that show deactivations during performance of attentionally demanding tasks, but also activation during certain processes including recall of autobiographical memories and processing information about oneself, among others. However, the DMN is not activated in a homogeneous manner during performance of such tasks, so it is not clear to what extent its activation patterns correspond to deactivation patterns seen during attention-demanding tasks. In this fMRI study we compared patterns of activation in response to an autobiographical memory task to those observed in a self/other-reflection task, and compared both to deactivations observed during the n-back working memory task. Autobiographical recall and self-reflection activated several common DMN areas, which were also deactivated below baseline levels by the n-back task. Activation in the medial temporal lobe was seen during autobiographical recall but not the self/other task, and right angular gyrus activity was specifically linked to other-reflection. ROI analysis showed that most, but not all DMN regions were activated above baseline levels during the autobiographical memory and self-reflection tasks. Our results provide evidence for the usefulness of the autobiographical memory task to study DMN activity and support the notion of interacting subsystems within this network."

Here, using radioligand assay with Aplysia californica AChBP and radioiodinated α-bungarotoxin ([125I]-αBgt), we show that BBIQA1, BBIQA2, and d-tubocurarine (d-TC) have similar affinities to nAChR orthosteric site. However, a competition with [125I]-αBgt for binding to the Torpedo californica muscle-type nAChR revealed that BBIQAs1, 2, and 3 are less potent (IC50s = 26.3, 8.75, and 17.0 μM) than d-TC (IC50 = 0.39 μM), while with α7 nAChR in GH4C1 cells, BBIQA1 was less potent that d-TC (IC50s = 162 μM and 7.77 μM, respectively), but BBIQA2 was similar (IC50 = 5.52 μM). In inhibiting the Ca2+ responses induced by acetylcholine in Neuro2a cells expressing the mouse adult α1β1εδ nAChR or human α7 nAChR, BBIQAs1 and 2 had similar potencies to d-TC (IC50s in the range 0.75-3.08 μM). Our data suggest that BBIQA1 and BBIQA2 can inhibit adult muscle α1β1εδ nAChR by both competitive and noncompetitive mechanisms. Further experiments on neuronal α3β2, α4β2, and α9α10 nAChRs, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, showed that similar potencies for BBIQAs1, 2, and d-TC. With α3β2γ2 GABAAR currents were almost completely inhibited by d-TC at a high (100 μM) concentration, but BBIQAs1 and 2 were less potent (only 40-50% inhibition), whereas in competition with Alexa Fluor 546-α-cobratoxin for binding to α1β3γ2 GABAAR in Neuro2a cells, d-TC and these analogs had comparable affinities. Especially interesting effects of BBIQAs1 and 2 in comparison with d-TC were observed for 5-HT3AR: BBIQA1 and BBIQA2 were 5- and 87-fold less potent than d-TC (IC50 = 22.63 nM). Thus, our results reveal that these BBIQAs differ from d-TC in their potencies towards certain Cys-loop receptors, and we suggest that understanding the reasons behind this might be useful for future drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2907869868,"The Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita is an abundant, polytypic Palearctic bird. Validity of some of its subspecies is controversial and birds from some parts of the species range remain unclassified taxonomically. The relationships among populations from different geographic areas have not been sufficiently explored with molecular data. In this study we analyzed the relationships among the four species in the ‘chiffchaff complex’ (Common Chiffchaff, Iberian Chiffchaff P. ibericus, Canary Islands Chiffchaff P. canariensis and Mountain Chiffchaff P. sindianus), and the patterns of intraspecific geographic variation in the mtDNA ND2 gene and intron 9 of the Z-linked aconitase gene (ACO1I9) across the Common Chiffchaff range, including a recently discovered population breeding on Mt. Hermon (Anti-Lebanon mountains). Our data supported the monophyly of the chiffchaff complex and its current systematics at the species level. Within the Common Chiffchaff, the Siberian race P. c. tristis was the most differentiated subspecies and may represent a separate or incipient species. Other Common Chiffchaff subspecies also were differentiated in their mtDNA, however, lineages of neighboring subspecies formed wide zones of introgression. The Mt. Hermon population was of mixed genetic origin but contained some birds with novel unique lineage that could not be assigned to known subspecies. All Common Chiffchaff lineages diverged at the end of the Ionian stage of Pleistocene. Lineage sorting of ACO1I9 alleles was not as complete as that of mtDNA. Chiffchaff species were mostly distinct at ACO1I9, except the Common and Canary Islands Chiffchaffs that shared multiple alleles. An AMOVA identified geographic structure in Common Chiffchaff ACO1I9 variation that was broadly consistent with that of mtDNA ND2 gene. The genetic and other data suggest the chiffchaff complex to be a group of evolutionarily young taxa that represent a paradigm of ‘species evolution in action’ from intergrading subspecies through to apparently complete biological speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2908511032,"Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts are fibroblasts activated by surrounding cancer cells. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts exhibit enhanced cell migration, which plays an important role in cancer metastasis. Previously, we demonstrated enhanced migration of NIH3T3 fibroblasts when they were cultured in the presence of MCF7 breast cancer cells. Human fibroblasts displayed a similar phenomenon even when they were co-cultured with cancer cells other than MCF7 cells. In this study, we screened ∼16,000 compounds from the RIKEN Natural Products Depository chemical library for inhibitors of enhanced NIH3T3 cell migration in the presence of MCF7. We identified NPD8733 as an inhibitor of cancer cell–enhanced fibroblast migration. This inhibition was observed not only in a wound-healing co-culture assay but also in a Transwell migration assay. Using NPD8733 and a structurally similar but inactive derivative, NPD8126, on immobilized beads, we found that NPD8733, but not NPD8126, specifically binds to valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a member of the ATPase-associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) protein family. Using VCP truncation variants, we found that NPD8733 binds to the D1 domain of VCP. Because VCP’s D1 domain is important for its function, we concluded that NPD8733 may act on VCP by binding to this domain. siRNA-mediated silencing of VCP in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, but not in MCF7 cells, reduced the migration of the co-cultured NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These results indicate that MCF7 activates the migration of NIH3T3 cells through VCP and that NPD8733 binds VCP and thereby inhibits its activity.

These results indicate that MCF7 activates the migration of NIH3T3 cells through VCP and that NPD8733 binds VCP and thereby inhibits its activity. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in cancer metastasis, and fibroblasts occupy a major portion of this microenvironment. Fibroblasts are known to support the growth of cancer cells by secreting growth factors as well as extracellular matrix components (1Cirri P. Chiarugi P.

Thus, these heterogeneous CAFs are involved in a wide range of functions in cancer progression, including cancer initiation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming (7Buchsbaum R.J.

Emerging studies have shown that CAFs may contribute to the resistance of chemotherapy (8Amornsupak K. Insawang T. Thuwajit P. O-Charoenrat P. Eccles S.A. Thuwajit C. Cancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cells.BMC Cancer. 2014; 14 (25512109): 95510.1186/1471-2407-14-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Lundgren K.

Although there are numerous proteins that are expressed in fibroblasts associated with cancer cells, such as α-smooth muscle actin, fibroblast activation protein, podoplanin, tenascin-C, and many more (10Shiga K. Hara M. Nagasaki T. Sato T. Takahashi H. Takeyama H.

The limited knowledge regarding a specific protein marker makes it difficult to develop a drug targeting activated fibroblasts. Most compounds that are being considered for targeting cancer stroma are not just restricted to CAFs (11LeBeau A.M. Brennen W.N. Aggarwal S. Denmeade S.R. Targeting the cancer stroma with a fibroblast activation protein-activated promelittin protoxin.Mol.

In our previous study, enhanced migration of NIH3T3 fibroblasts was observed when co-cultured with MCF7 breast cancer cells (14Suvarna K. Honda K. Kondoh Y. Osada H. Watanabe N. Identification of a small-molecule ligand of β-arrestin1 as an inhibitor of stromal fibroblast cell migration accelerated by cancer cells.Cancer Med. 2018; 7 (29380537): 883-89310.1002/cam4.1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The fibroblasts that show enhanced migration, a characteristic of CAFs, are referred to as activated fibroblasts. As MCF7 cancer cells are able to induce changes in NIH3T3 fibroblast cell migration when co-cultured, any small molecule that inhibits such a phenomenon may be an inhibitor of fibroblasts activated by cancer cells. Understanding the mechanism of fibroblast activation by cancer cells is intricate, as there are numerous signaling pathways involved. Thus, our previous study suggests that the small-molecule inhibitors of activated fibroblasts may provide insight into understanding the mechanism of fibroblast activation. In this study, we screened ∼16,000 small compounds from the RIKEN NPDepo chemical library using a previously established wound healing co-culture assay. Compound NPD8733 was identified as inhibiting the enhanced migration of fibroblasts when co-cultured with cancer cells. By using an in vitro pulldown assay and proteomics analysis, valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 was identified to be the target protein for NPD8733. VCP is a ubiquitously expressed protein that belongs to the ATPase-associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) protein family. VCP is involved in many cellular processes, such as protein degradation, apoptosis, and autophagy (15Yeo B.K. Yu S.W. Valosin-containing protein (VCP): structure, functions, and implications in neurodegenerative diseases.Animal Cells Syst. 2016; 20: 303-30910.1080/19768354.2016.1259181Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Papadopoulos C.

NPD8733 will become a useful tool for understanding the mechanism of fibroblast activation through VCP. We previously observed significantly enhanced migration of NIH3T3 fibroblasts when they were cultured in the presence of MCF7 breast cancer cells. This enhanced migration was also observed when a Transwell migration assay was used for co-culturing (14Suvarna K. Honda K. Kondoh Y. Osada H. Watanabe N. Identification of a small-molecule ligand of β-arrestin1 as an inhibitor of stromal fibroblast cell migration accelerated by cancer cells.Cancer Med. 2018; 7 (29380537): 883-89310.1002/cam4.1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Human fibroblasts also showed a similar phenomenon when co-cultured with cancer cells other than MCF7. We found that this enhanced migration was inhibited by a small-molecule ligand of an adaptor protein, β-arrestin, that activates the actin fiber–severing protein cofilin through its dephosphorylation (14Suvarna K. Honda K. Kondoh Y. Osada H. Watanabe N. Identification of a small-molecule ligand of β-arrestin1 as an inhibitor of stromal fibroblast cell migration accelerated by cancer cells.Cancer Med. 2018; 7 (29380537): 883-89310.1002/cam4.1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, we expanded the screening to identify additional small molecules that act as inhibitors of fibroblasts migration, which is normally increased by cancer cells. The initial screening for small-molecule inhibitors of accelerated fibroblast migration was performed in 96-well plates using 1 μg/ml of library compounds. The compounds that inhibited the enhanced migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells were selected. A similar screening was repeated twice using 24-well and 6-well plates. We identified five compounds, NPD8732, FSL0816 (procaterol), NPD6543, HTD1063, and NPD6330, that reproducibly inhibit the enhanced migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells and have no effect on the migration of NIH3T3 cells when cultured alone for 48 h (Fig. S1). These compounds showed no effects on cytotoxicity of either MCF7 or NIH3T3 cells, even at a high concentration, such as 10 μg/ml (Figs. S1 and S2, A and B). Additionally, we examined the effects of these compounds on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migration. However, none of these compounds inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S2, C and D), indicating that these compounds specifically inhibit the enhanced migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells. Among these five compounds, procaterol is a compound known to act as an agonist for the β2-adrenergic receptor, which is used in the treatment of asthma (18Tashimo H. Yamashita N. Ishida H. Nagase H. Adachi T. Nakano J. Yamamura K. Yano T. Yoshihara H. Ohta K. Effect of procaterol, a β2 selective adrenergic receptor agonist, on airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.Allergol. Int. 2007; 56 (17582211): 241-24710.2332/allergolint.O-06-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, we did not advance with the target identification study for this compound. The remaining compounds were examined for inhibition of migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells at 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 μg/ml to select potent compounds (Fig. S3). Compounds NPD8732, NPD6330, and HTD1063 were selected, whereas NPD6543 showed inhibitory activity only at a higher dose. To identify target proteins for these three potent compounds, we attempted to prepare compound-conjugated agarose beads using a photocross-linking technique (19Kanoh N. Honda K. Simizu S. Muroi M. Osada H. Photo-cross-linked small-molecule affinity matrix for facilitating forward and reverse chemical genetics.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44 (15880755): 3559-356210.1002/anie.200462370Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, we could not obtain NPD8732 conjugated beads, as this compound was damaged by the 265-nm UV irradiation that is required for photocross-linking. Thus, we searched for compounds that were structurally similar to NPD8732 in the RIKEN NPDepo library and examined their ability to inhibit migration. We identified compound NPD8733 as inhibiting the enhanced migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1). Significant inhibition of fibroblast migration, which was enhanced by co-cultured cancer cells, was observed in the presence of NPD8733 at a concentration of 3 μm or higher (Fig. 1, C and D). Migration of NIH3T3 cells alone was not affected by NPD8733 (Fig. 1E). Similar inhibition of enhanced migration was also observed using a Transwell migration assay (Fig. 2). Only a small number of NIH3T3 cells migrated through the filter, whereas migration was enhanced more than six times when co-cultured with MCF7 cells. NPD8733 at 1 μm or higher inhibited this enhanced migration significantly, and at 9 μm, enhanced migration was completely abolished (Fig. 2, A and B). We confirmed that NPD8733 did not inhibit the migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells because of its cytotoxic effects on either NIH3T3 or MCF7 cells (Fig. 2C). To understand the mechanism behind the migratory inhibition of co-cultured NIH3T3 fibroblasts by NPD8733, NPD6330, and HTD1063, we sought to identify the target proteins of these compounds using pulldown analyses through small molecule–conjugated beads. Unfortunately, we could not identify proteins that specifically bound to the compounds NPD6330 and HTD1063 (data not shown), but we did find a protein that bound specifically to NPD8733-conjugated beads. To further analyze this protein, we prepared agarose beads conjugated with NPD8126, which is structurally similar to NPD8733 but does not have any effects on enhanced migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3, A–C). The cell lysates from NIH3T3 cells co-cultured with MCF7 were incubated with naked beads as a control, NPD8126 beads, or NPD8733 beads for 3 h. Then the reacted beads were washed three times to remove unbound protein, and the proteins that co-precipitated with beads were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). One protein band specifically co-precipitated with NPD8733 beads and was identified, using MALDI-TOF-MS, as VCP (Fig. 3D and Fig. S4). To further confirm the binding of NPD8733 to VCP, we performed an in vitro pulldown assay using bacterial lysate expressing VCP. A pGEX-2T vector encoding a GST-tagged VCP was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, and the expression of the fusion protein was induced. This bacterial cell lysate was incubated with control beads or NPD8126- or NPD8733-bound beads for 3 h. The beads were then washed, and the co-precipitated proteins were eluted and examined using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Using CBB staining and an anti-GST antibody, we confirmed the specific binding of compound NPD8733 to the GST-VCP protein (Fig. 4A). Sasazawa et al. (20Sasazawa Y. Kanagaki S. Tashiro E. Nogawa T. Muroi M. Kondoh Y. Osada H. Imoto M. Xanthohumol impairs autophagosome maturation through direct inhibition of valosin-containing protein.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7 (22360440): 892-90010.1021/cb200492hCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) previously identified a small compound, xanthohumol, which binds to VCP and recognizes it to be autophagy-modulatory. They also showed that xanthohumol binds to the VCP N-terminal domain, which is a substrate and co-factor–binding domain. Using the same deletion constructs of recombinant GST-tagged VCP protein, we attempted to determine the binding domain for NPD8733 (Fig. 4B). E. coli BL21 cells were induced for the production of the GST-tagged WT VCP or three deletion mutants that lacked the N-terminal domain (GST-VCPΔN), the D1 domain (GST-VCPΔD1), or the D2 domain (GST-VCPΔD2). Then lysates from these cells were incubated with control beads or NPD8733-bound beads, and bound proteins were analyzed as above. As shown in Fig. 4C, GST-VCP, GST-VCPΔD2, and GST-VCPΔN were pulled down by NPD8733 beads but not by control beads, whereas GST-VCPΔD1 was not pulled down by NPD8733 beads, clearly indicating that NPD8733 binds to the D1 domain of VCP. Because the D1 domain of VCP displays ATPase activity, we examined the effect of NPD8733 binding on ATPase activity. For this, we made GST-VCP construct S459* (the 459th Ser was changed to a stop codon) that contains only the D1 ATPase domain but not the D2 domain. Then we measured the ATPase activity of full-length and S459* GST-VCP (Fig. S5). As reported previously, both the D1 and D2 domains had ATPase activity, although that of D1 was weaker than that of D2. Next, we examined the effect of NPD8733 on these activities. NPD8733 had some inhibitory effects on the ATPase activity of GST-VCPs, although it was less potent than the known VCP ATPase inhibitor N,N′-dibenzylquinazoline-2,4-diamine. Actually, 50% inhibition of ATPase activity could not be obtained, not even in the presence of 100 μm NPD8733, which was a more than 10 times higher concentration of the in vivo effective concentration. From these results, we concluded that NPD8733 binds to the D1 domain of VCP and that this binding has a modest effect on the ATPase activity of D1, but this effect cannot explain the inhibitory effect of fibroblast migration accelerated by cancer cells. This indicates that the binding of NPD8733 to the D1 domain of VCP inhibits VCP function in a way other than through its ATPase activity, which should be elucidated in the near future. As NPD8733 was identified to bind to VCP and inhibits enhanced migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells, we hypothesized that VCP may play an important role in migration. However, so far, there are no reports showing the significance of VCP in cell migration. The expression level of endogenous VCP in NIH3T3 cells is similar to that in MCF7 cells (Fig. S6). Although the expression of VCP was not significantly changed by co-culturing, we examined the effects of VCP silencing in NIH3T3 or MCF7 cells on enhanced cell migration through co-cultures. We used two oligoribonucleotides, oligo 1 and oligo 2, for VCP silencing. The sequence of oligo 1 is specific for human VCP, whereas that of oligo 2 is the same for human and mouse VCP. As expected, oligo 1 successfully silenced VCP expression of MCF7 human breast cancer cells, whereas successful silencing of VCP was detected in NIH3T3 cells with oligo 2 (Fig. 5A). Using these oligoribonucleotides, we examined the effects of VCP presilencing in NIH3T3 and/or MCF7 cells on enhanced fibroblast migration when co-culturing (Fig. 5). Separately cultured NIH3T3 and MCF7 cells were transfected with VCP-targeting or control oligoribonucleotides and cultured for 24 h. Then NIH3T3 cells were cultured alone or co-cultured with siRNA-transfected MCF7 cells overnight. Cells were then scratched, and migration was examined after 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5, significant inhibition of accelerated migration in co-cultures was detected when VCP was presilenced in NIH3T3 cells. When VCP was not presilenced in NIH3T3 cells, accelerated migration was not inhibited even when VCP was silenced in MCF7 cells. This result was also confirmed using another oligoribonucleotide, oligo 3, which targets both human and mouse VCP (Fig. S7). These results indicate that VCP in NIH3T3 cells is required for accelerated migration by cancer cells and strongly suggests that NPD8733 targets VCP expressed in NIH3T3 cells, causing inhibition of enhanced migration. This study shows that NPD8733 inhibits the enhanced migration of co-cultured NIH3T3 cells by binding to VCP, a ubiquitously expressed protein that belongs to the AAA+ protein family. VCP is involved in multiple cellular processes, such as protein degradation, apoptosis, and autophagy (15Yeo B.K. Yu S.W.

These in vivo results are consistent with our finding that VCP has an important role in the migration of fibroblasts surrounding cancer cells, as silencing of VCP in fibroblasts inhibited the accelerated migration in co-cultures. VCP, also referred to as p97, consists of four domains, including the N-terminal domain, the two ATPase domains D1 and D2, and the unstructured C-terminal tail (15Yeo B.K. Yu S.W.

We also detected ATPase activity in both the D1 and D2 domains. However, binding of NPD8733 to the D1 domain only modestly inhibited the ATPase activity, and the mechanism of inhibition by NPD8733 remains to be elucidated. We have shown that NPD8733 bound to the D1 domain of VCP. The D1 domain of VCP has minor ATPase activity and is also known to be involved in oligomerization for hexamer formation, which occurs after ATP hydrolysis (15Yeo B.K. Yu S.W.

https://openalex.org/W2907585874,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Although RTT has been associated with obesity, the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, female heterozygous Mecp2-null mice (Mecp2+/- mice), a model of RTT, were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD), and the changes in molecular signaling pathways were investigated. Specifically, we examined the expression of genes related to the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, which represent a central network of feeding behavior control. In particular, dopamine reward circuitry has been shown to regulate hedonic feeding behavior, and its disruption is associated with HFD-related changes in palatability. The Mecp2+/- mice that were fed the normal chow showed normal body weight and food consumption, whereas those fed the HFD showed extreme obesity with hyperphagia, an increase of body fat mass, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance compared with wild-type mice fed the HFD (WT-HFD mice). The main cause of obesity in Mecp2+/--HFD mice was a remarkable increase in calorie intake, with no difference in oxygen consumption or locomotor activity. Agouti-related peptide mRNA and protein levels were increased, whereas proopiomelanocortin mRNA and protein levels were reduced in Mecp2+/--HFD mice with hyperleptinemia, which play an essential role in appetite and satiety in the hypothalamus. The conditioned place preference test revealed that Mecp2+/- mice preferred the HFD. Tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area, and dopamine receptor and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens were significantly lower in Mecp2+/--HFD mice than those of WT-HFD mice. Thus, HFD feeding induced dysregulation of food intake in the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, and accelerated the development of extreme obesity associated with addiction-like eating behavior in Mecp2+/- mice."

This study analyzed the effect of chemical dyes on P. ostreatus growth, DyP activity and the expression of four Pleos-dyp genes during the time-course of Pleurotus ostreatus cultures containing either Acetyl Yellow G (AYG), Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) or Acid Blue 129 (AB129) dyes. Additionally, Pleos DyP1 was heterologously expressed in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma atroviride in order to explore the potential of a secreted recombinant enzyme for decolorizing different dyes in cultures and plate assays. The addition of dyes had an induction effect on the enzymatic activity, with the fermentations undertaken using RBBR and AYG dyes presenting the highest total DyP activity. DyP gene expression profiles displayed up/down regulation during the culture of three Pleos-dyp genes (Pleos-dyp1, Pleos-dyp2 and Pleos-dyp4), while Pleos-dyp3 transcript was not detected under any of the culture conditions studied. A 14-fold relative induction level (log2) increase for Pleos-dyp2 and Pleos-dyp4 in AB129 and AYG, respectively, was also found. The presence of AB129 resulted in the highest Pleos-dyp1 gene induction and repression level, corresponding to 11.83 and -14.6-fold relative expression and repression levels, respectively. The lowest expression level of all genes was observed in RBBR, a response which is associated with the growth phase. The filamentous fungus Trichoderma atroviride was successfully transformed for the heterologous expression of Pleos-dyp1. The modified strains (TaDyP) were able to decolorize mono-azo, di-azo, anthraquinone and anthracenedione dyes with extracellular DyP1 activity found in the culture supernatant. After 96 h of culture, the recombinant TaDyP strains were able to degrade (decolorize) 77 and 34% of 0.05mM AB129 and 0.25mM AYG, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2907357487,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy affecting women worldwide. The development of disease is related to high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection. Cytology has been the most recommended triage for primary cervical (pre)cancer screening despite relatively low sensitivity. Recently, genomic DNA methylation has been proposed as an additional marker to increase sensitivity for detecting cervical precancerous lesion. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of methylation status of three tumor suppressor genes (CADM1, FAM19A4, and MAL) and HPV genotyping in detection of cytologic and histologic abnormalities in cervical cancer screening. Two hundred and sixty samples with available frozen cell pellets including 70 randomly selected cases of negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM)&HPV-negative, 70 randomly selected cases of NILM&HPV-positive, and 120 cytologic abnormalities & HPV-positive from a population-based cervical cancer screening program (n = 7,604) were investigated for the DNA methylation pattern of CADM1, FAM19A4, and MAL. Of 120 cytologic abnormalities & HPV-positive cases, there were 115 available histologic results. HPV52 and HPV58 were most commonly found in histologic HSIL+. The methylation levels of CADM1, FAM19A4, and MAL were elevated with the severity of cytologic abnormality which significantly increased by 3.37, 6.65 and 2 folds, respectively, in cytologic HSIL comparing with NILM. A significant increase in methylation levels of these three genes was also observed in histologic HSIL+ compared with negative histology but only CADM1 showed a significant higher methylation level than histologic LSIL. Using the ROC curve analysis, DNA methylation levels of FAM19A4 performed best in differentiating high-grade cytology (ASC-H+ from NILM/ASC-US/LSIL), followed by CADM1 and MAL. Whilst the CADM1 methylation performed best in distinguishing histologic HSIL+ from negative/LSIL with an area under the ROC curve of 0.684, followed by MAL (0.663) and FAM19A4 (0.642). Interestingly, after combining high DNA methylation levels to HPV16/18 genotypes, rates of histologic HSIL+ detection were substantially increased from 25% to 79.55% for CADM1, 77.27% for FAM19A4, and 72.73% for MAL, respectively. The rate further increased up to 95.45% when at least one of three genes had a high methylation level. This suggests a possible role of genomic DNA methylation, especially CADM1, in detecting histologic HSIL+ lesions in combination with hrHPV testing."
https://openalex.org/W2907699955,"In the post genomic era, high throughput data augment stoichiometric flux balance models to compute accurate metabolic flux states, growth and energy phenotypes. Investigating altered metabolism in the context of evolved resistant genotypes potentially provide simple strategies to overcome drug resistance and induce susceptibility to existing antibiotics. A genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) for Chromobacterium violaceum, an opportunistic human pathogen, was reconstructed using legacy data. Experimental constraints were used to represent antibiotic susceptible and resistant populations. Model predictions were validated using growth and respiration data successfully. Differential flux distribution and metabolic reprogramming were identified as a response to antibiotics, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. Streptomycin resistant populations (StrpR) redirected tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux through the glyoxylate shunt. Chloramphenicol resistant populations (ChlR) resorted to overflow metabolism producing acetate and formate. This switch to fermentative metabolism is potentially through excess reducing equivalents and increased NADH/NAD ratios. Reduced proton gradients and changed Proton Motive Force (PMF) induced by antibiotics were also predicted and verified experimentally using flow cytometry based membrane potential measurements. Pareto analysis of NADH and ATP maintenance showed the decoupling of electron transfer and ATP synthesis in StrpR. Redox homeostasis and NAD+ cycling through rewiring metabolic flux was implicated in re-sensitizing antibiotic resistant C. violaceum. These approaches can be used to probe metabolic vulnerabilities of resistant pathogens. On the verge of a post-antibiotic era, we foresee a critical need for systems level understanding of pathogens and host interaction to extend shelf life of antibiotics and strategize novel therapies."

However, the anti-inflammatory effects of the AZD8999 monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids are unknown. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of AZD8999 in monotherapy and combined with fluticasone propionate in neutrophils from healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy and COPD patients were incubated with AZD8999 and fluticasone propionate, individually or in combination, for 1h followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation for 6h. The IL-8, MMP9, IL-1β, and GM-CSF release was measured in cell culture supernatants. AZD8999 shows ~ 50% maximum inhibitory effect and similar potency inhibiting the released cytokines in neutrophils from healthy and COPD patients. However, while fluticasone propionate suppresses mediator release in neutrophils from healthy patients, COPD neutrophils are less sensitive. The combination of non-effective concentrations of AZD8999 (0.01nM) with non-effective concentrations of fluticasone propionate (0.1nM) shows synergistic anti-inflammatory effects. The studied mechanisms that may be involved in the synergistic anti-inflammatory effects of this combination include the increase of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)α and MKP1 expression, the induction of glucocorticoid response element (GRE) activation and the decrease of ERK1/2, P38 and GR-Ser226 phosphorylations compared with monotherapies. In summary, AZD8999 shows anti-inflammatory effects in neutrophils from COPD patients and induces synergistic anti-inflammatory effects when combined with fluticasone propionate, supporting the use of MABA/ICS combination therapy in COPD."

In this study, we estimated the spatial ecology of Saimaa ringed seals during the breeding season in the ice-covered period of December-April. The telemetry data on tagged seals (n = 20), with a total of 25 separate tracking periods and birth lair locations (n = 59) of non-tagged seals, were studied to estimate the movement ecology and breeding density. The movements of the ringed seals were more restricted during the ice-covered season; the total home range size (average 7.4 km2) in winter was 13 times smaller than that in summer. Individual tagged seals occupied an average of 5 ± 3 SD subnivean haul outs (snow lairs or ice cavities), and the mean distance between the haul outs was 1.6 ± 1.1 SD km (range 0.2-5.9 km). Moreover, our data indicated that ringed seal females likely exhibited breeding time avoidance of each other's core areas, which may indicate some degree of territoriality. This was supported by the findings that the core areas (mean 1.2 km2) of tagged adult females (n = 9), did not overlap with each other. Also data on non-tagged seals showed that females did not give birth to pups within the core area radius of other parturient females. This study, together with earlier findings on the home ranges of nursed pups and perinatal mortality rates, has implications into land usage planning in Lake Saimaa by highlighting the need of undisturbed area between seal lairs and anthropogenic disturbances."

We also found that the dimer is present in solution and partially occludes the membrane-binding surfaces of annexin, suggesting that dimerization may function as a means for regulating membrane binding. Accordingly, as revealed by in vitro binding and cellular localization assays, ANX A13a variants that favor a monomeric state exhibited increased membrane association relative to variants that favor the dimeric form.

https://openalex.org/W2907356012,"Intravesical therapy using Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the most established cancer immunotherapy for bladder cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms are unknown. Mycolic acid (MA), the most abundant lipid of the BCG cell wall, is suspected to be one of the essential active components of this immunogenicity. Here, we developed cationic liposomes incorporating three subclasses (α, keto, and methoxy) of MA purified separately from BCG, using the dendron-bearing lipid D22. The cationic liposomes using D22 were efficiently taken up by the murine bladder cancer cell line MB49 in vitro, but the non-cationic liposomes were not. Lip-kMA, a cationic liposome containing keto-MA, presented strong antitumor activity in two murine syngeneic graft models using the murine bladder cancer cell lines MB49 and MBT-2 in comparison to both Lip-aMA and Lip-mMA, which contained α-MA and methoxy-MA, respectively. Interestingly, Lip-kMA(D12), which was made of D12 instead of D22, did not exhibit antitumor activity in the murine syngeneic graft model using MB49 cells, although it was successfully taken up by MB49 cells in vitro. Histologically, compared to the number of infiltrating CD4 lymphocytes, the number of CD8 lymphocytes was higher in the tumors treated with Lip-kMA. Antitumor effects of Lip-kMA were not observed in nude mice, whereas weak but significant effects were observed in beige mice with natural killer activity deficiency. Thus, a cationized liposome containing keto-MA derived from BCG induced in vivo antitumor immunity. These findings will provide new insights into lipid immunogenicity and the underlying mechanisms of BCG immunotherapy."

However, the suggestion was based on excellent outcomes of high-volume or aortic centers. How about the real results in most places around the world? The purpose of this study was intended to compared in-hospital mortality, major complications, and aortic remodeling between TAR and/or stent graft implantation in a medical center of northern Taiwan.Between January 2008 and August 2017, 156 patients with acute type I aortic dissection underwent surgery at our institution, including proximal aortic replacement only (Group I, n = 72), concomitant TAR (Group II, n = 23), concomitant TAR extended with stent grafting (Group III, n = 45), and proximal aortic replacement with descending aortic stent grafting (Group IV, n = 16).No significant differences were found in underlying disease and preoperative presentations, including operative risk among four groups. Overall in-hospital mortality was 22.4% (13 patients in Group I, 9 in Group II, 12 in Group III, and 1 in Group IV). New-onset stroke occurred in 15 patients postoperatively (3 patients [5.2%] in Group I, 3 [21.4%] in Group II, and 9 [26.5%] in Group III after excluding 36 patients with documented preoperative cerebrovascular accident or cerebral malperfusion). Root reconstruction and TAR were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. TAR was significantly associated with surgery-related stroke. Compared to those in Group I, true lumen expansion and false lumen shrinkage during 1-year aortic remodeling were significantly higher in Groups III and IV. Both TAR and descending aorta stent grafting were significantly associated with decreased risk of patent false lumen.Proximal aortic replacement remains the preferred surgical strategy for acute type I aortic dissection, with lower mortality and neurological complications. Proximal descending aorta stent grafting may benefit aortic remodeling, even without TAR."
https://openalex.org/W2906824992,"After bone resorption, ions and degraded organic components are co-released into the extracellular space. Ions and growth factors, although different in their biological nature, induce a common and coordinated chemotactic effect. Conditioned media has been used successfully in bone regeneration by promoting endogenous cell recruitment. Likewise, calcium alone act as a paracrine chemotactic signal, inducing the host's undifferentiated progenitor cell infiltration into the implanted biomaterials. The aim of the present study was to compare the chemotactic effect of calcium and conditioned media in primary calvarial cells.The chemotactic cell response was evaluated in vitro using an agarose spot and a wound healing assay. In addition, we used a calvarial bone explant model ex-vivo. The healing potential was also tested through an in vivo model, a critical-size calvarial bone defect in mice. For the in vivo experiment, cell-free calcium-containing or conditioned media-containing scaffolds were implanted, and MSC's seeded scaffolds were used as positive control. After seven weeks post-implantation, samples were retrieved, and bone regeneration was evaluated by μCT and histological analysis. Osteogenic gene expression was evaluated by qPCR.We found that chemotactic cell migration in response to either calcium or conditioned media was equivalent in vitro and ex vivo. Accordingly, μCT analysis showed that bone regeneration induced by the MSC's seeded scaffolds was similar to that obtained with cell-free calcium or conditioned media-containing scaffolds. Pre-treatment with SB202190, a highly selective p38 inhibitor, abrogated the chemotactic effect induced by conditioned media. In contrast, p38 activity was not essential for the calcium-induced chemotaxis. Moreover, BAPTA-AM treatment, a cytosolic calcium chelator, decreased the chemotactic effect and the expression of key osteogenic genes induced by calcium or conditioned media.We show that calcium ions alone not only mimic the conditioned media chemotactic effect, but also induce an osteogenic effect similar to that produced by transplanted MSC's in vivo. Furthermore, the chemotactic effect induced by conditioned media is calcium and p38 dependent. The rise in cytosolic calcium might integrate the different signaling pathways triggered by conditioned media and extracellular Ca2+. This calcium-driven in situ bone regeneration is a promising and convenient alternative to promote endogenous cell recruitment into the injured bone site. This pre-clinical cell-free and growth factor-free approach might avoid the disadvantages of the ex vivo cell manipulation."

This study aimed to analyze fetal and infant mortality of CS reported to the Health Information System in a State in Northeastern Brazil.This was a cross-sectional study that analyzed the deaths of CS from 2010 to 2014 through the linkage of the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sinan). The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 was used to calculate the rates of Fetal, Perinatal, Neonatal (early and late), and Postneonatal Mortality. Simple linear regression was performed. Fisher's exact test or Pearson's chi-square test were used for comparison of proportions and Student's t-test was used for comparison of means. Of the 414 cases reported to the SIM as deaths possibly caused by CS, 44 (10.6%) presented CS as the underlying cause. From 2010 to 2014 the Infant Mortality Rate of CS was 16.3 per 100,000 live births (y = 0.65x + 14.33, R2 = 0.2338, p = 0.003). There was an 89.4% underreporting of deaths. Perinatal deaths and fetal deaths of CS accounted for 87.7% and 73.9% of total deaths, respectively.The results of the study revealed a significant Fetal and Infant Mortality rate of CS and demonstrated the importance of using the linkage method in studies that involve the analysis of secondary data obtained from mortality and disease reporting systems. The underreporting of CS as a cause of fetal and infant mortality leads to unawareness of the reality of deaths from this disease, hindering the development of public policies aimed at its prevention."

Data in youth are lacking, and controversies exist on whether PPS is related to psychopathology. In the present study, we showed data on the prevalence of PPS in a population (N = 2959) of students aged 10 to 14 years. We also explored the possible association between PPS and emotional or behavioural problems. Our results showed that PPS is a relatively common phenomenon with a prevalence rate of 58.9%, being more frequent in females. In univariate and multivariate analyses, we also found an association between the presence of PPS and emotional problems and temper tantrums, after accounting for relevant covariates. PPS is a relevant phenomenon to be considered in youth. It is common and may be a signal for emotional problems."

Age-sex specific cost-effectiveness analyses of HZ/su vaccine are warranted to inform decision-making on vaccine policy. We aimed to determine the optimal gender-specific age for cost-effective HZ/su vaccination in Hong Kong.A Markov model was used to compare outcomes with and without HZ/su in healthy males and females at age 50-80 years. Model outcome measures were total cost, HZ cases, and HZ-associated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss. Incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER) by HZ/su was estimated for each age-sex group. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of model results.HZ/su reduced incidence of HZ in both males and females aged 50-80 years and the numbers needed to vaccinate to avoid one HZ case were lowest at age 60 years for males (6.05) and females (5.50). The highest QALY-saved occurred in females (0.00396 QALYs) and males (0.00379 QALYs) who were vaccinated at 60 years old. The ICERs were lowest at age 60-70 years for both genders. Using 1× gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong (USD46,153) as willingness-to-pay threshold, HZ/su vaccine was accepted to be cost-effective for all female and male age groups at vaccine cost = USD160, for female aged 50-79 years and male aged 54-74 years at vaccine cost = USD200, and for female aged 59-71 years at vaccine cost = USD240.HZ/su vaccine is more likely to be cost-effective for males and females aged between 60-70 years than the extreme age groups (less than 60 years and older than 70 years) in Hong Kong. The age range for cost-effective acceptance of HZ/su vaccine appears to be broader in females than males given the same vaccine cost and willingness-to-pay threshold."
https://openalex.org/W2908448765,"Feather quality is of critical importance to long-distance migratory birds. Here, we report a series of analyses of a unique data set encompassing known-age individuals of the long-distance migratory Sand Martin (Riparia riparia). Sampling over 17 years along the Tisza River, eastern Hungary, has resulted in the recapture of numerous individuals enabling longitudinal and cross-sectional investigation of the role of adaptation to variable environmental conditions on feather morphology. We show that older individuals tend to possess better quality feathers, measured using bending stiffness, feather length and thickness as proxies. Bending stiffness and feather thickness do not change with individual age, in contrast with increases in feather length and declines in daily feather growth versus age of individual alongside moult duration. Individuals who live to older ages tend to have similar, or higher, feather growth rates and better feather quality than individuals captured at younger ages. Thus, on the basis of strong selection against individuals with slow feather growth, as seen in other species of swallows and martins, which causes a delay in moult completion, the results of this analysis highlight the potential cost of producing better quality feathers when this depends on moult duration. Feather length also does change during the lifetime of the individual and thus enabled us to further investigate influence of individual and environmental conditions during the moult. The results of this analysis provide important insights on the adaptive significance of these traits, and the potential use of physical characteristics in unravelling the reasons why long distance migratory bird populations are in global decline."
https://openalex.org/W2907250608,"It is evident that some perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), a group of globally dispersed pollutants, have long biological half-lives in humans and farm animals. However, the effects of PFAAs in domestic animals have not been fully elucidated. The present study investigated how exposure to a single dose of a mixture of 10 PFAAs influenced hepatic and renal gene expression and histopathology, as well as plasma clinical biochemistry, in microminipigs (MMPigs) over 21 days. In animals treated with PFAAs, the mRNA expression of twelve genes related to fatty acid metabolism was upregulated in the kidney, while only few of these genes were induced in the liver. The expression of several kidney injury-associated genes such as, IGFBP1, IGFBP6, GCLC X2, GCLC X3, MSGT1, OLR1 was upregulated in the kidney. Interestingly, the expression of IGFBP-genes was differentially altered in the liver and kidney. Our findings thus identified hepato-renal gene expression changes in MMPigs that were associated with various molecular pathways including peroxisome proliferation, lipid metabolism, kidney injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, serum HDL levels were significantly decreased following exposure to PFAAs, whereas no significant histopathological changes were detected, as compared to the vehicle group. Taken together, the present study provided the first indication that a single exposure to a mixture of PFAAs can produce changes in MMPig renal gene expression that were observed three weeks post exposure, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the kidney as a primary target organ of PFAAs."

Evidence that a respiratory shield in Escherichia coli protects a low-molecular-mass FeII pool from O2-dependent oxidationJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 294Issue 1PreviewIron is critical for virtually all organisms, yet major questions remain regarding the systems-level understanding of iron in whole cells. Here, we obtained Mössbauer and EPR spectra of Escherichia coli cells prepared under different nutrient iron concentrations, carbon sources, growth phases, and O2 concentrations to better understand their global iron content. We investigated WT cells and those lacking Fur, FtnA, Bfr, and Dps proteins. The coarse-grain iron content of exponentially growing cells consisted of iron–sulfur clusters, variable amounts of nonheme high-spin FeII species, and an unassigned residual quadrupole doublet. Full-Text PDF Open Access The earth's ecosphere converted from reducing to oxidative ∼2.5 billion years ago, the boundary between the Archean and Proterozoic eons (1Crichton R.R. Pierre J.L.

This change meant a shift in iron's redox equilibrium from soluble FeII to FeIII, which is subsequently rendered insoluble by hydrolysis to [FeO(OH)]n (2Kosman D.J.

Organisms at this boundary—archaeal and bacterial anaerobes—were totally dependent on the ferrous iron pool in which they evolved. For example, the terminal electron transport pathway that fueled ATP synthesis at their plasma membranes was an enzyme cohort largely assembled using nutrient ferrous iron. In regard to energy metabolism, what distinguished nascent aerobes was a terminal dioxygen reductase coupled to this pathway, cytochrome c oxidase (3Brochier-Armanet C. Talla E. Gribaldo S. The multiple evolutionary histories of dioxygen reductases: Implications for the origin and evolution of aerobic respiration.Mol. Biol.

When this protection is lost through run-down of terminal respiration in the bacterial inner membrane, oxygen tension increases in the cytoplasm, oxidizing a fraction of what is generally referred to as the labile iron pool of ferrous iron (5Lv H. Shang P. The significance, trafficking and determination of labile iron in cytosol, mitochondria and lysosomes.Metallomics. 2018; 10 (29923582): 899-91610.1039/C8MT00048DCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). This autoxidation results in the accumulation of a cytoplasmic pool of ferric iron nanoparticles. The Wofford et al. (4Wofford J.D. Bolaji N. Dziuba N. Outten F.W. Lindahl P.A.

Previous investigations of iron speciation in cells have utilized a variety of methods, including Mössbauer spectroscopy. Mössbauer is likely not the most familiar of spectroscopies, and yet it is a remarkably straightforward method. Briefly, it is γ-photon absorption spectroscopy. In iron Mössbauer, the photon comes from the first excited nuclear state of 57Fe in the source and is captured (absorbed) by the 57Fe in the sample (natural abundance 2.1%) resulting in a nuclear quantum transition that can be visualized as a loss of signal (6Pandelia M.E. Lanz N.D. Booker S.J. Krebs C. Mössbauer spectroscopy of Fe/S proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1853 (25498248): 1395-140510.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.12.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This transition is called an isomer shift, but can be thought of as functionally equivalent to a chemical shift in NMR, where the iron species in the sample will have a specific readout. This isomer shift, δ, is therefore informative about the redox and electronic spin state of the metal. Broadly speaking, δ increases with spin state and with the increase in d-electron spin density in FeII compared with FeIII. Moreover, as in NMR, additional spectroscopic details can reveal the nuclear quantum state (via quadrupole splitting, Δ) or the electronic environment (via hyperfine splitting) (6Pandelia M.E. Lanz N.D. Booker S.J. Krebs C. Mössbauer spectroscopy of Fe/S proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1853 (25498248): 1395-140510.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.12.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, quadrupole splitting occurs when the angular momentum quantum number, I, is >1/2 and is in a nonspherical electric field typical of an asymmetric ligand environment. Wofford et al. (4Wofford J.D. Bolaji N. Dziuba N. Outten F.W. Lindahl P.A. Evidence that a respiratory shield in Escherichia coli protects a low-molecular-mass FeII pool from O2-dependent oxidation.J. Biol.

These elements of Mössbauer spectra are illustrated by some of their most significant data in Fig. 1A. Finally, Mössbauer has exceptional resolution but low sensitivity, meaning that spectral data accumulation takes hours not minutes; it is a credit to the authors that they have made the commitment to fully exploit this technique in the elucidation of cellular iron metabolism. There are several unique take-home messages provided by the data presented by Wofford et al. (4Wofford J.D. Bolaji N. Dziuba N. Outten F.W. Lindahl P.A. Evidence that a respiratory shield in Escherichia coli protects a low-molecular-mass FeII pool from O2-dependent oxidation.J. Biol.

Previous work had provided evidence both for and against the storage of large amounts of iron as FeIII in ferritin (i.e. bacterioferritin), which could be used to protect cellular iron and avoid oxygen toxicity (7Jhurry N.D. Chakrabarti M. McCormick S.P. Holmes-Hampton G.P. Lindahl P.A. Biophysical investigation of the ironome of human Jurkat cells and mitochondria.Biochemistry. 2012; 51 (22726227): 5276-528410.1021/bi300382dCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In their system, using E. coli without overexpression of any proteins, Wofford et al. observed only a small amount of iron that displayed ferritin-like features, helping to resolve this controversy. Another novel observation is that the nonheme, high-spin FeII spectral signature of iron coordinated by O and N ligands is contributed by two biochemically separable species. Importantly, when cellular respiration in the form of electron flux to O2 via complex IV was inhibited by the addition of CN−, one of these species, designated FeIILMM, decreased (Fig. 1A). A significant fraction of this iron was converted to what the authors have characterized as magnetically ordered ferric oxyhydroxide nanoparticles, importantly differing from previous assignments of this species as ferritin iron. Based on biochemical fractionation, the authors further linked this FeIILMM species to what is commonly referred to as the cellular labile iron pool (4Wofford J.D. Bolaji N. Dziuba N. Outten F.W. Lindahl P.A. Evidence that a respiratory shield in Escherichia coli protects a low-molecular-mass FeII pool from O2-dependent oxidation.J. Biol.

The demonstration that this iron pool is sensitive to autoxidation and deposited as inert iron nanoparticles is a novel finding. Their model of this respiratory shield is illustrated in Fig. 1B. The Lindahl group has previously demonstrated a similar link between diminished respiratory electron flux and iron nanoparticle deposition in mitochondria (7Jhurry N.D. Chakrabarti M. McCormick S.P. Holmes-Hampton G.P. Lindahl P.A.

Their conclusion is that whether in the bacterial inner membrane or in the mitochondrial matrix, aside from providing the H+-gradient that supports ATP synthesis, respiration maintains a microaerobic environment that stabilizes the ferrous iron required in the assembly of heme and FeS clusters. In this context, it is noteworthy that mitochondrial “anaerobiosis” also supports the assembly of an active nitrogenase, further evidence of this “respiratory shield” (8López-Torrejón G. Jiménez-Vicente E. Buesa J.M. Hernandez J.A. Verma H.K. Rubio L.M. Expression of a functional oxygen-labile nitrogenase component in the mitochondrial matrix of aerobically grown yeast.Nat.

After all, as Lynn Margulis (Sagan) pointed out over a half-century ago, mitochondria are simply repurposed bacteria (9Sagan L. On the origin of mitosing cells.J. Theor.

https://openalex.org/W2906768435,"Acoustic signals play an important role in premating isolation based on sexual selection within many taxa. Many male parasitic wasps produce characteristic courtship songs used by females in mate selection. In Cotesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Microgastrinae), courtship songs are generated by wing fanning with repetitive pulses in stereotypical patterns. Our objectives were to sample the diversity of courtship songs within Cotesia and to identify e underlying patterns of differentiation. We compared songs among 12 of ca. 80 Cotesia species in North America, including ten species that have not been recorded previously. For Cotesia congregata, we compared songs of wasps originating from six different host-foodplant sources, two of which are considered incipient species. Songs of emergent males from wild caterpillar hosts in five different families were recorded, and pattern, frequency, and duration of song elements analyzed. Principal component analysis converted the seven elements characterized into four uncorrelated components used in a hierarchical cluster analysis and grouped species by similarity of song structure. Species songs varied significantly in duration of repeating pulse and buzz elements and/or in fundamental frequency. Cluster analysis resolved similar species groups in agreement with the most recent molecular phylogeny for Cotesia spp., indicating the potential for using courtship songs as a predictor of genetic relatedness. Courtship song analysis may aid in identifying closely related cryptic species that overlap spatially, and provide insight into the evolution of this highly diverse and agriculturally important taxon."
https://openalex.org/W2907022423,"Wetland ecosystems are known to mitigate high nutrient loadings and thus can improve water quality and prevent potential biodiversity loss caused by eutrophication. Plant traits affect wetland processes directly through effects on accumulation or metabolization of substances, and indirectly by affecting microbial transformation processes in the soil. Understanding the causes and consequences of intraspecific variation in plant functional traits and associated ecosystem processes can aid applied ecological approaches such as wetland restoration and construction. Here we investigated molecular variation and phenotypic variation in response to three levels of nitrogen availability for a regional set of populations of the common wetland plant Juncus effusus. We asked whether trait expression reveals signatures of adaptive differentiation by comparing genetic differentiation in quantitative traits and neutral molecular markers (QST-FST comparisons) and relating trait variation to soil conditions of the plant's origin. Molecular analyses showed that samples clustered into three very distinct genetic lineages with strong population differentiation within and among lineages. Differentiation for quantitative traits was substantial but did not exceed neutral expectations when compared across treatments or for each treatment and lineage separately. However, variation in trait expression could be explained by local soil environmental conditions of sample origin, e.g. for aboveground carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios, suggesting adaptive differentiation to contribute to trait expression even at regional level."

Although methods of their analysis are well developed, the use of these methods does not always give unambiguous results, as presented in the paper. An example of underground tank is considered in which cylindrical roof collapsed during construction under soil and excavator loads. The causes of failure are investigated with deterministic and stochastic models. In the first step nonlinear finite element analysis including soil-structure interaction was performed to examine overall level of the structural safety, which was found satisfactory thus not explaining the collapse. In the second step an analytical stochastic model was developed and analysed with emphasis to sensitivity. The last analysis explained the collapse as a complex of unfavourable states for considered variables and the failure was recognised as a mixed construction-geotechnical-structural problem. The key role played backfill properties and its depth."
https://openalex.org/W2908470502,"African populations are characterized by high degree of genetic diversity. This high genetic diversity could result from the natural selection pressure. Several studies have described an association between some genetic diversities and difference of susceptibility to infectious diseases like malaria. It seems therefore important to consider genetic diversity impact when interpreting results of clinical trials in malaria endemic areas. This study aimed to determine the genetic polymorphism with erythrocyte traits in different populations of malaria endemic area in Mali. The cross-sectional surveys were carried out in different ethnic groups living in malaria endemic areas in Mali. Six milliliters of whole blood were collected in EDTA vials from each participant after informed consent has been obtained. The ABO, RH, Kell, MNSs, Kidd and Duffy systems phenotypes were assessed by the technique of gel filtration. A total of 231 subjects were included from six villages. The blood groups phenotypes O (40.7%) and A (31.2%) were more frequent with respective allele frequencies of 0.65 and 0.21. In the RH system the haplotypes R0 (0.55), r (0.20) and R1 (0.13) were the most frequent. Seven percent (7%) of Duffy positive and 4% of Glycophorin B deficiency (S-s-) were observed among participants. All participants were Kell negative. ABO and RH systems were polymorphic in these ethnic groups in Mali. Their implication in susceptibility to malaria should be taken into account in clinical trials interpretation, and for prevention of blood transfusion risks during anemia frequently caused by malaria in children."
