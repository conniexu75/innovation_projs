https://openalex.org/W4224084066,"Industrial pollution reduction is a crucial issue in the pursuit of sustainable economic and environmental development. As a product of the deep integration of traditional finance and Internet information technology, digital finance has become an effective tool for regulating the use of funds and strengthening the effectiveness of policies in the context of the digital era, which has obvious effects on industrial pollution emissions. Using panel data of 260 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011–2019 and the digital inclusive finance index jointly compiled by Peking University and Ant Financial Services Group, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of digital finance on industrial pollution emissions through fixed effects model, mediating effects model and threshold effects model. The empirical results show that digital finance can effectively reduce industrial pollution and part of the impact is achieved through industrial structure. In the process of reducing industrial pollution by digital finance, there exists double threshold effects. When the development of digital finance breaks the threshold value, the industrial pollution emission reduction effect appears to accelerate. Finally, this paper puts forward targeted suggestions to promote industrial pollution reduction and environmental economic development."

There are relatively few species known where the detailed chemical characterization of biosurfactant has been reported. Here, we report isolation and chemical characterization of the biosurfactant produced by a biodesulfurizing bacterium Gordonia sp. IITR100. Biosurfactant production was determined by performing oil spreading, drop-collapse, Emulsion index (E24), and Bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (BATH) assay. The biosurfactant was identified as a glycolipid by LCMS and GCMS analysis. The chemical structure was further confirmed by performing FTIR and NMR of the extracted biosurfactant. The emulsion formed by the biosurfactant was found to be stable between temperatures of 4°C to 30°C, pH of 6 to 10 and salt concentrations up to 2%. It was successful in reducing the surface tension of the aqueous media from 61.06 mN/m to 36.82 mN/m. The biosurfactant produced can be used in petroleum, detergents, soaps, the food and beverage industry and the healthcare industry."
https://openalex.org/W3208889169,"Data sharing is very important for accelerating scientific research, business innovations, and for informing individuals. Yet, concerns over data privacy, cost, and lack of secure data-sharing solutions have prevented data owners from sharing data. To overcome these issues, several research works have proposed blockchain-based data-sharing solutions for their ability to add transparency and control to the data-sharing process. Yet, while models for decentralized data sharing exist, how to incentivize these structures to enable data sharing at scale remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study different incentive mechanisms for decentralized data-sharing platforms. Smart contracts are used to automate different payment options between data owners and data requesters. We evaluate multiple cost pricing scenarios for data monetization by simulating incentive mechanisms on a blockchain-based data-sharing platform. We show that a cost compensation model for the data owner rapidly cover the cost of data sharing and balance the overall incentives for all the actors in the platform."
https://openalex.org/W4223898804,"Head motion continues to be a major problem in fMRI research, particularly in developmental studies where an inverse relationship exists between head motion and age. Despite multifaceted and costly efforts to mitigate motion and motion-related signal artifact, few studies have characterized in-scanner head motion itself. This study leverages a large transdiagnostic public dataset (N = 1388, age 5-21y, The Healthy Brain Network Biobank) to characterize pediatric head motion in space, frequency, and time. We focus on practical aspects of head motion that could impact future study design, including comparing motion across groups (low, medium, and high movers), across conditions (movie-watching and rest), and between males and females. Analyses showed that in all conditions, high movers exhibited a different pattern of motion than low and medium movers that was dominated by x-rotation, and z- and y-translation. High motion spikes (&gt;0.3mm) from all participants also showed this pitch-z-y pattern. Problematic head motion is thus composed of a single type of biomechanical motion, which we infer to be a nodding movement, providing a focused target for motion reduction strategies. A second type of motion was evident via spectral analysis of raw displacement data. This was observed in low and medium movers and was consistent with respiration rates. We consider this to be a baseline of motion best targeted in data preprocessing. Further, we found that males moved more than, but not differently from, females. Significant cross-condition differences in head motion were found. Movies had lower mean motion, and especially in high movers, movie-watching reduced within-run linear increases in head motion (i.e., temporal drift). Finally, we used intersubject correlations of framewise displacement (FD-ISCs) to assess for stimulus-correlated motion trends. Subject motion was more correlated in movie than rest, and 8 out of top 10 FD-ISC windows had FD below the mean. Possible reasons and future implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4224042065,"Decision-makers (DMs) are not sufficiently exposed to concepts such as efficiency and risk in innovative activities from the perspective of organizational strategy. The challenges become even greater when these DMs lack expertise in technology and deal with uncertain circumstances. In this sense, exchanging expert knowledge between DMs and technical teams will strengthen the link between technology planning and strategic management. The purpose of this study is to bridge the knowledge gap between these two groups. It introduces a framework to translate the organization’s strategy into technological decisions at an acceptable innovation risk level. This framework considers aspects such as knowledge, type of innovation, and innovation process. This study focuses on determining whether activities should be accepted or rejected by examining the uncertainty and efficiency of innovation. It also introduces a novel perspective on the hybrid ""success-failure"" uncertainty of innovation, and a new measure called ""efficiency probability,"" which DMs and technology developers can use to intuitively engage in the innovation process. This paper seeks to propose a practical strategy map for new product development under uncertain conditions. To achieve this goal, the Fuzzy Front-End (FFE) concept, fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA) model, and adjustable possibilistic programming (APP) approach are applied. The results of this study indicate that innovative activities typically have low efficiency and high uncertainty. Therefore, the decision to implement or abandon them requires reviewing and balancing the goals and strategic approach of the organization with technological and business features."
https://openalex.org/W4224086587,"There are different types of adversarial attacks and defences for machine learning algorithms which makes assessing the robustness of an algorithm a daunting task. Moreover, there is an intrinsic bias in these adversarial attacks and defences to make matters worse. Here, we organise the problems faced: a) Model Dependence, b) Insufficient Evaluation, c) False Adversarial Samples, and d) Perturbation Dependent Results. Based on this, we propose a model agnostic adversarial robustness assessment method based on L0 and L∞ distance-based norms and the concept of robustness levels to tackle the problems. We validate our robustness assessment on several neural network architectures (WideResNet, ResNet, AllConv, DenseNet, NIN, LeNet and CapsNet) and adversarial defences for image classification problem. The proposed robustness assessment reveals that the robustness may vary significantly depending on the metric used (i.e., L0 or L∞). Hence, the duality should be taken into account for a correct evaluation. Moreover, a mathematical derivation and a counter-example suggest that L1 and L2 metrics alone are not sufficient to avoid spurious adversarial samples. Interestingly, the threshold attack of the proposed assessment is a novel L∞ black-box adversarial method which requires even more minor perturbation than the One-Pixel Attack (only 12% of One-Pixel Attack's amount of perturbation) to achieve similar results. We further show that all current networks and defences are vulnerable at all levels of robustness, suggesting that current networks and defences are only effective against a few attacks keeping the models vulnerable to different types of attacks."
https://openalex.org/W4224125359,"Background Confidence in the central UK Government has declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while this may be linked to specific government actions to curb the spread of the virus, understanding is still incomplete. Examining public opinion is important, as research suggests that low confidence in government increases the extent of non-compliance with infection-dampening rules (for instance, social distancing); however, the detailed reasons for this association are still unclear. Methods To understand public opinion on the central UK government during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modeling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 4000 free-text survey responses, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. Results We identified eleven topics, among which were topics related to perceived government corruption and cronyism, complaints about inconsistency in rules and messaging, lack of clear planning, and lack of openness and transparency. Participants reported that elements of the government’s approach had made it difficult to comply with guidelines (e.g., changing rules) or were having impacts on mental wellbeing (e.g., inability to plan for the future). Conclusions Results suggested that consistent, transparent communication and messaging from the government is critical to improving compliance with measures to contain the virus, as well as protecting mental health during health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4223922217,"Worldwide, diarrhea is the second most common cause of death and morbidity among under -five years' children. In sub-saran Africa, access to water, sanitation, and hygiene are very scanty and the burden of diarrhea diseases is countless relative to the rest of the world. Prior studies conducted in East Africa vary in design, sample size, and other data collection tools. Through those studies, it is hard to make regional comparisons. Combining datasets that are studied on similar people and having common variable identified enhances statistical power due to the large sample size, advance the ability to compare outcomes, and create the opportunity to develop new indicators. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of diarrhea among under five years' children using the most recent national representative Demographic and Health Surveys from 12 East African countries. The information generated from this pooled datasets will give good insight into the sub-regional prevalence of diarrhea.This study utilized secondary data from 12 East African countries' most recent demographic health survey. Variables were extracted and appended together to assess the pooled prevalence of diarrhea and associated factors. A total of 90,263 under-five years of age children were encompassed in this study. STATA version was used to cross-tabulate and fit the models. To account for the hierarchical nature of the demographic health survey, multilevel logistic regression was calibrated. BIC, AIC, deviance, and LLR were used as Model comparison parameters. Variables with a p-value of <0.2 were considered for multivariable analysis. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI and p-value <0.05 were used to declare statistical significances of factors.The pooled prevalence of diarrhea in under five years children was 14.28% [95%CI; 14.06%, 14.51%]. Being child whose mother age is 15-24 years [AOR = 1.41, 95% CI; 1.33, 1.49], 25-34 years[AOR = 1.17, 95%CI; 1.10, 1.23], being 7-12 months child [AOR = 3.10, 95%CI; 2.86, 3.35], being 12-24 months child [AOR = 2.56, 95%CI; 2.38, 3.75], being 25-59 months child [AOR = 0.88, 95%CI; 0.82, 0.95], being child from poor household [AOR = 1.16, 95%CI; 1.09, 1.23], delayed breast feeding initiation (initiated after an hour of birth) [AOR = 1.15, 95%CI; 1.10, 1.20], and being a child from community with low educational status [AOR = 1.10, 95%CI; 1.03, 1.18] were factors associated with diarrheal diseases.The pooled prevalence of diarrhea among under five years of children in East African countries is high. Maternal age, child's age, wealth status of the household, the timing of breast feeding initiation, sex of the child, community level of educational status, working status of the mother, and the number of under five children were factors that were associated with diarrheal diseases. Scaling up of maternal and child health services by government and other concerned bodies should consider those economically marginalized communities. Additionally, awareness should be created for those uneducated mothers concerning the nature of childhood diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W4223956476,"Wheat crop is very sensitive to osmotic stress conditions. As an abiotic stress, drought may exert a considerable effect on the levels of specialized metabolites in plants. These metabolites may exert beneficial biological activities in the prevention or treatment of disorders linked to oxidative stress in plants and humans. Furthermore, osmoprotector accumulation helps wheat to increase the maintenance of osmotic balance. Therefore, identifying wheat genotypes with better drought tolerance is extremely important. In this sense, this research aimed to understand agronomic, physiological and biochemical responses of spring wheat strains and cultivars to drought stress, under field conditions, and jointly select strains via multi-trait index. We evaluated agronomic, physiological and biochemical variables in 18 genotypes under field condition. The results demonstrated that all variables were affected by the drought. Most genotypes were significantly reduced in grain yield, except VI_14774, VI_14668, VI_9007 and TBIO_ATON. The variables related to photosynthesis were also affected. An increase above 800% was observed in proline contents in genotypes under drought. Sodium and potassium also increased, mainly for VI_131313 (Na), while VI_130758 and VI_14774 presented increased K. We evaluated the antioxidant potential of the different strains and the total content of phenolic compounds. The most drought-responsive genotypes were BRS_264, VI_14050 and VI_14426. Reduced grain yield and photosynthetic variables, and increased specialized metabolism compounds are due to plant defense mechanisms against drought conditions. Furthermore, variation in genotypes can be explained by the fact that each plant presents a different defense and tolerance mechanism, which may also occur between genotypes of the same species. Four strains were selected by the multivariate index: VI_14055, VI_14001, VI_14426 and VI_1466. Such results allow us to predict which genotype(s) performed best in semi-arid environments and under climatic fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W4224069183,"Mislabeling of seafood is a global phenomenon that can misrepresent the status and level of consumption of wild fish stocks while concealing the use of many other wild species or those originating from aquaculture and sold as substitutes. We conducted a DNA barcoding study in three cities within Mexico (Mazatlan, Mexico City and Cancun) and sequenced the COI gene in 376 fish samples sold as 48 distinct commercial names at fish markets, grocery stores, and restaurants. Our goal was to identify the main species sold, their mislabeling rates and the species most used as substitutes. Overall, the study-wide mislabeling rate was 30.8% (95% CI 26.4-35.6). Half of the samples collected belonged to five species traded globally (yellowfin tuna, Atlantic salmon, mahi, swai, and tilapia), most of them with important aquaculture or ranching production levels. These species were commonly used as substitutes for other species and showed low mislabeling rates themselves (≤ 11%, except mahi mahi with 39% mislabeling). The other half of the samples revealed nearly 100 species targeted by small-scale fishers in Mexico and sold under 42 distinct commercial names. Popular local commercial names (dorado, marlin, mero, robalo, mojarra, huachinango, pargo, sierra) showed the highest mislabeling rates (36.3% to 94.4%) and served to sell many of the 53 species identified as substitutes in our study. We discuss the observed patterns in relation to landing and import data showing differences in availability of commercial species and the links to explain observed mislabeling rates and the use of a species as a substitute for other species. We also outline some of the implications of establishing a labeling and traceability standard as an alternative to improve transparency in the trade of seafood products in Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W4224043206,"Introduction In 2019, 4.6% of US-MD students self-identified as students with disabilities (SWD); many of these students will require accommodations on the USMLE Step-1 examination. Given the high-stakes nature of Step-1 for medical school advancement and residency match, SWD denied accommodations on Step-1 face considerable consequences. To date no study has investigated the rate of accommodation denial and its impact on medical school operations. Methods To investigate the rate of accommodation denial and evaluate whether Step-1 accommodation denial impacts medical school operations, a 10-question survey was sent to Student Affairs Deans and disability resource professionals at all fully-accredited US-MD granting programs. Two open-ended questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results Seventy-three of the 141 schools responded (52%). In the 2018–2019 academic year, 276 students from 73 schools applied for Step-1 accommodations. Of these, 144 (52%) were denied. Of those denied, 74/144 (51%) were delayed entry into the next phase of curriculum and 110/144 (76%) took the Step-1 exam unaccommodated. Of the 110 who took Step-1 without accommodations, 35/110 (32%) failed the exam, and 4/110 (3%) withdrew or were dismissed following exam failure. Schools reported varied investments of time and financial support for students denied accommodations, with most schools investing less than 20 hours (67%) and less than $1,000.00 (69%). Open-responses revealed details regarding the impact of denial on schools and students including frustration with process; financial and human resources allocation; delay in student progression; lack of resourcing and expertise; and emotional and financial burdens on students. Discussion Step-1 accommodation denial has non-trivial financial, operational, and career impacts on medical schools and students alike. The cause of accommodation denial in this population requires further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W4224008959,"Pediatric out-of-hours calls are common, as parents worry and seek reassurance and shared responsibility. Nevertheless, most children assessed in this context are not seriously ill. Conventional telephone triage lacks visual cues and is further limited by third part communication in calls concerning children. We investigated implementation of video triage in two previous studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate 1) How video triage versus telephone triage in children was experienced by parents and call-handlers, and 2) call-handlers' evaluation of the video triage projects.We triangulated data from surveys and interviews in five sub-studies. Sub-study 1: Parents' experience of video triage reported in closed-ended questionnaire items using quantitative analysis; Sub-study 2: Parents' experience of video triage reported as questionnaire free-text using qualitative content analysis; Sub-study 3: Call-handlers' experience of video triage reported in closed-ended questionnaire items using quantitative analysis; and Sub-studies 4 and 5: Individual interviews of call-handlers' experience of 1) video triage using thematic analysis and 2) the video triage project using process evaluation.Most parents' comments regarding video triage were positive (n = 164, 83%). Video triage was perceived as reassuring and reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and unnecessary hospital visits. Call-handlers experienced that video triage improved patient assessment and caller reassurance. Some call-handlers complained that the time allocated for study participation was inadequate and requested a more accessible video set-up. Both parents and call-handlers were significantly more satisfied and reassured after video triage than after telephone triage and suggested video triage as a permanent option.Video triage was appreciated by parents and call-handlers and was recommended as a permanent option. The call-handlers suggested that designated time for participation in the studies would have been desirable in this busy call-center. We recommend video triage as a contemporary solution in out-of-hours service."
https://openalex.org/W4224024691,"Infections caused by Fusobacterium species are rare; however serious infections with complications or mortality may occur occasionally. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the clinical features of patients with Fusobacterium infections and the differences between infections caused by the species F . necrophorum , F . nucleatum , and F . varium . Additionally, we attempted to identify risk factors for Fusobacterium -associated mortality. This study included all patients at a large tertiary care teaching hospital in South Korea with Fusobacterium infections from January 2006 to April 2021. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors for in-hospital mortality associated with F . nucleatum and F . varium infections. We identified 272 patients with Fusobacterium infections during the study period. The number of Fusobacterium cases has increased recently, with F . varium infections markedly increasing since 2016 and causing a significant proportion of infections. Patients with F . varium infections were older and had a higher proportion of nosocomial infections than the other groups. The F . nucleatum and F . varium groups showed higher in-hospital mortality than the F . necrophorum group. Through logistic regression analysis, APACHE II score and serum albumin level were considered risk factors for in-hospital mortality. APACHE II score was positively correlated with age, red cell distribution width, and serum blood urea nitrogen, and negatively correlated with serum albumin level. Infections caused by Fusobacterium species are increasing. F . varium causes a significant proportion of severe infections."
https://openalex.org/W4223892646,"Down syndrome (DS), also known as trisomy 21 (T21), is the most common genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability. There are two methods commonly used for prenatal testing of DS: serum screening (SS) for biomarkers in maternal serum and noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy by cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma. However, cost-effectiveness analyses of these two methods are mostly based on data derived from simulations with various models, with theoretical values calculated. In this study, we statistically analyzed clinical DS screening data and pregnancy outcomes during the follow-up of pregnant women in Zhuhai City, China. The economics of the two mainstream prenatal DS screening methods was evaluated from a public health perspective.A retrospective analysis was performed on the data of 17,363 pregnant women who received SS and NIPT during gestation in Zhuhai from 2018 to 2019, and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed with four screening strategies. In strategy I, all pregnant women received SS, and those with T21 risk ≥1/270 had invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD). In strategy II, all pregnant women received SS, those with T21 risk ≥ 1/270 had IPD, and those with 1/270 > T21 risk ≥ 1/1,000 had NIPT; then, women at high risk based on NIPT also had IPD. In strategy III, all pregnant women received SS, and those with T21 risk ≥1,000 had NIPT; then, women at high risk based on NIPT results had IPD. In strategy IV, all pregnant women received NIPT and those at high risk based on NIPT results had IPD. Finally, to assess the cost and effectiveness of DS screening, the total costs were calculated as the sum of screening and diagnosis as well as the direct and indirect economic burden during the average life cycle of DS patients.A total of 22 of the 17,363 (1/789) pregnant women had DS, of which only one woman was over 35 years of age. SS detected 1,024 cases at high risk of T21 (≥1/270), 8 cases were true positive, with a positive predictive value of 0.78% and a detection rate of 36.4%. NIPT detected 27 cases at high risk of T21 (Z ≥ 3) and 22 cases of DS, with a positive predictive value of 81.5% and a detection rate of 100%. Strategy I had the largest total cost of 65.54 million CNY, strategy II and III had similar total costs of 40 million CNY, and strategy IV had the lowest total cost of 14.91 million CNY. By comparison, the screening strategy with NIPT alone had the highest health economic value for DS.SS was greatly affected by nuchal translucency and the accuracy of gestational age measured by ultrasonography. Unstandardized ultrasonography was an important reason for the low DS detection rate with SS. The influence of interfering factors on NIPT was much lower than in SS. NIPT can be used as an alternative to SS and as a primary screening strategy of prenatal DS screening for secondary prevention and control of birth defects. NIPT greatly decreased the frequency of IPD and the miscarriages associated with IPD, saved the limited medical and health resources, and greatly increased DS detection rate. Therefore, NIPT has great social and economic benefits."

https://openalex.org/W4224096927,"The COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly worldwide. On September 15, 2021, a total of 546,251 confirmed cases were recorded in Saudi Arabia alone. Saudi Arabia imposed various levels of lockdown and forced the community to implement social distancing. In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model to study the impact of these measures on COVID-19 spread. The model is analyzed qualitatively, producing two equilibrium points. The existence and stability of the COVID-19 free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium depend on the control reproduction number, [Formula: see text]. These results are in good agreement with the numerical experiments. Moreover, the model is fitted with actual data from the COVID-19 dashboard of the Saudi Ministry of Health. We divide the timeline from March 12, 2020, to September 23, 2020, into seven phases according to the varied applications of lockdown and social distancing. We then explore several scenarios to investigate the optimal application of these measures and address whether it is possible to rely solely on social distancing without imposing a lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W4225782389,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 750,000 US citizens. Dysregulation of the immune system underlies the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with inflammation mediated tissue injury to the lung in the setting of suppressed systemic immune function. To define the molecular mechanisms of immune dysfunction in COVID-19 we utilized a systems immunology approach centered on the circulating leukocyte phosphoproteome measured by mass cytometry. We find that although COVID-19 is associated with wholesale activation of a broad set of signaling pathways across myeloid and lymphoid cell populations, STAT3 phosphorylation predominated in both monocytes and T cells. STAT3 phosphorylation was tightly correlated with circulating IL-6 levels and high levels of phospho-STAT3 was associated with decreased markers of myeloid cell maturation/activation and decreased ex-vivo T cell IFN-γ production, demonstrating that during COVID-19 dysregulated cellular activation is associated with suppression of immune effector cell function. Collectively, these data reconcile the systemic inflammatory response and functional immunosuppression induced by COVID-19 and suggest STAT3 signaling may be the central pathophysiologic mechanism driving immune dysfunction in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4225895410,"We demonstrate that Microbial Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) can be utilized for creation of consolidates of Martian Simulant Soil (MSS) and Lunar Simulant Soil (LSS) in the form of a 'brick'. A urease producer bacterium, Sporosarcina pasteurii, was used to induce the MICP process for the both simulant soils. An admixture of guar gum as an organic polymer and NiCl2, as bio- catalyst to enhance urease activity, was introduced to increase the compressive strength of the biologically grown bricks. A casting method was utilized for a slurry consisting of the appropriate simulant soil and microbe; the slurry over a few days consolidated in the form of a 'brick' of the desired shape. In case of MSS, maximum strength of 3.3 MPa was obtained with 10mM NiCl2 and 1% guar gum supplementation whereas in case of LSS maximum strength of 5.65 Mpa was obtained with 1% guar gum supplementation and 10mM NiCl2. MICP mediated consolidation of the simulant soil was confirmed with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry (TG). Our work demonstrates a biological approach with an explicit casting method towards manufacturing of consolidated structures using extra-terrestrial regolith simulant; this is a promising route for in situ development of structural elements on the extra-terrestrial habitats."
https://openalex.org/W4223983746,"The use of Engineered Heart Tissues (EHT) as in vitro model for disease modeling and drug screening has increased, as they provide important insight into the genetic mechanisms, cardiac toxicity or drug responses. Consequently, this has highlighted the need for a standardized, unbiased, robust and automatic way to analyze hallmark physiological features of EHTs. In this study we described and validated a standalone application to analyze physiological features of EHTs in an automatic, robust, and unbiased way, using low computational time. The standalone application “ EHT Analysis ” contains two analysis modes (automatic and manual) to analyzes the contractile properties and the contraction kinetics of EHTs from high speed bright field videos. As output data, the graphs of displacement, contraction force and contraction kinetics per file will be generated together with the raw data. Additionally, it also generates a summary file containing all the data from the analyzed files, which facilitates and speeds up the post analysis. From our study we highlight the importance of analyzing the axial stress which is the force per surface area (μN/mm 2 ). This allows to have a readout overtime of tissue compaction, axial stress and leave the option to calculate at the end point of an experiment the physiological cross-section area (PSCA). We demonstrated the utility of this tool by analyzing contractile properties and compaction over time of EHTs made out of a double reporter human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) line (NKX2.5 EGFP/+- COUP-TFII mCherry/+ ) and different ratios of human adult cardiac fibroblasts (HCF). Our standalone application “EHT Analysis” can be applied for different studies where the physiological features of EHTs needs to be analyzed under the effect of a drug compound or in a disease model."
https://openalex.org/W4223994127,"With the development of computer technology, the concept of computer automatic control has gradually penetrated the research field of aircraft power control, and intelligent power control systems have become mainstream research. The present work aims to improve the performance of the broadband phase-locked loop (PLL) based on the linear Kalman filter. Specifically, this paper first introduces linear Kalman filter and second-order generalized integrator (SOGI). Then, SOGI is added to PLL based on the linear Kalman filter. The purpose is to use the infinite gain effect of SOGI at the central angular frequency to eliminate the time-varying angular frequency component in the error when the system inputs SOGI to achieve a better filtering effect. Then, the system's stability analysis and parameter settings are carried out to establish an intelligent phase-locked method of aviation variable frequency power supply. Finally, simulation experiments are performed. The experimental results demonstrate that PLL via the linear Kalman filter with SOGI can solve the problem that the output phase angle contains high-frequency components when the power supply voltage distortion rate is 10%. This scheme has a strong anti-interference ability under power grid voltage imbalance. The accuracy of the Long and Short-term Memory network used here is about 80%, which can well realize the intelligent aviation power frequency conversion control method. The research reported here provides a reference for establishing smart phase-locked technology of aviation variable frequency power supply."
https://openalex.org/W4224031944,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common tumour diseases worldwide and has poor survival, especially in the Asian population. Exploration based on biomarkers would be efficient for better diagnosis, prediction, and targeted therapy.Expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Survival-related genes were identified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and univariate Cox. Then, we applied a Bayesian hierarchical lasso Cox model for prognostic signature screening. Protein-protein interaction and Spearman analysis were performed. Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were applied to evaluate the prediction performance. Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify prognostic factors, and a prognostic nomogram was constructed for clinical application.With the Bayesian lasso Cox model, a 9-gene signature included TNFRSF11A, NMNAT1, EIF5A, NOTCH3, TOR2A, E2F8, PSMA5, TPMT, and KIF11 was established to predict overall survival in GC. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that E2F8 was likely related to KIF11. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference between the high-risk and low-risk groups (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the 9-gene signature was an independent predictor (HR = 2.609, 95% CI 2.017-3.370), and the C-index of the integrative model reached 0.75. Function enrichment analysis for different risk groups revealed the most significant enrichment pathway/term, including pyrimidine metabolism and respiratory electron transport chain.Our findings suggested that a novel prognostic model based on a 9-gene signature was developed to predict GC patients in high-risk and improve prediction performance. We hope our model could provide a reference for risk classification and clinical decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4224124298,"Microbial mimicry of the host proteins/peptides can elicit host auto-reactive T- or B-cells resulting in autoimmune disease(s). Since intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are involved in several host cell signaling and PPI networks, molecular mimicry of the IDPRs can help the pathogens in substituting their own proteins in the host cell-signaling and PPI networks and, ultimately hijacking the host cellular machinery. Thus, the present study was conducted to discern the structural disorder and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) like, molecular recognition features (MoRFs), short linear motifs (SLiMs), and low complexity regions (LCRs) in the experimentally verified mimicry proteins and peptides (mimitopes) of bacteria, viruses and host. Also, functional characteristics of the mimicry proteins were studied in silico. Our results indicated that 78% of the bacterial host mimicry proteins and 45% of the bacterial host mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered while, 73% of the viral host mimicry proteins and 31% of the viral host mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered. Among the pathogens, 27% of the bacterial mimicry proteins and 13% of the bacterial mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered while, 53% of the viral mimicry proteins and 21% of the viral mimitopes were moderately/highly disordered. Though IDPR were frequent in host, bacterial and viral mimicry proteins, only a few mimitopes overlapped with the IDPRs like, MoRFs, SLiMs and LCRs. This suggests that most of the microbes cannot use molecular mimicry to modulate the host PPIs and hijack the host cell machinery. Functional analyses indicated that most of the pathogens exhibited mimicry with the host proteins involved in ion binding and signaling pathways. This is the first report on the disordered regions and functional aspects of experimentally proven host and microbial mimicry proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4225696671,"A comprehensive understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved at different stages of neurodegenerative diseases is key for the advance of preventive and disease-modifying treatments. Gene expression alterations in the diseased brain is a potential source of information about biological processes affected by pathology. In this work, we performed a systematic comparison of gene expression alterations in the brains of human patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and animal models of amyloidopathy and tauopathy. Using a systems biology approach to uncover biological processes associated with gene expression alterations, we could pinpoint processes more strongly associated with tauopathy/PSP and amyloidopathy/AD. We show that gene expression alterations related to immune-inflammatory responses preponderate in younger, whereas those associated to synaptic transmission are mainly observed in older AD patients. In PSP, however, changes associated with immune-inflammatory responses and synaptic transmission overlap. These two different patterns observed in AD and PSP brains are fairly recapitulated in animal models of amyloidopathy and tauopathy, respectively. Moreover, in AD, but not PSP or animal models, gene expression alterations related to RNA splicing are highly prevalent, whereas those associated with myelination are enriched both in AD and PSP, but not in animal models. Finally, we identify 12 AD and 4 PSP genetic risk factors in cell-type specific co-expression modules, thus contributing to unveil the possible role of these genes to pathogenesis. Altogether, this work contributes to unravel the potential biological processes affected by amyloid versus tau pathology and how they could contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and PSP."

The current study aims to assess the outcome and the indicators of success for PDA stenting in different ductal morphologies using various approaches.A prospective cohort study from a single tertiary center presented from January 2018 to December 2019 that included 96 consecutive infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary circulation and palliated with PDA stenting. Patients were divided according to PDA origin into 4 groups: Group 1: PDA from proximal descending aorta, Group 2: from undersurface of aortic arch, Group 3: opposite the subclavian artery, Group 4: opposite the innominate/brachiocephalic artery.The median age of patients was 22 days and median weight was 3 kg. The procedure was successful in 78 patients (81.25%). PDA was tortuous in 70 out of 96 patients. Femoral artery was the preferred approach in Group 1 (63/67), while axillary artery access was preferred in the other groups (6/11 in Group 2, 11/17 in Group 3, 1/1 in Group 4, P <0.0001). The main cause of procedural failure was inadequate parked coronary wire inside one of the branch of pulmonary arteries (14 cases; 77.7%), while 2 cases (11.1%) were complicated by acute stent thrombosis, and another 2 cases with stent dislodgment. Other procedural complications comprised femoral artery thrombosis in 7 cases (7.2%). Patients with straight PDA, younger age at procedure and who had larger PDA at pulmonary end had higher odds for success (OR = 8.01, 2.94, 7.40, CI = 1.011-63.68, 0.960-0.99, 1.172-7.40,respectively, P = 0.048, 0.031,0.022 respectively).The approach for PDA stenting and hence the outcome is markedly determined by the PDA origin and morphology. Patients with straight PDA, younger age at procedure and those who had relatively larger PDA at the pulmonary end had better opportunity for successful procedure."
https://openalex.org/W4223961301,"Bioplastics, synthesized by several microbes, accumulates inside cells under stress conditions as a storage material. Several microbial enzymes play a crucial role in their degradation. This research was carried to test the biodegradability of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) utilizing PHB depolymerase, produced by bacteria isolated from sewage waste soil samples. Potent PHB degrader was screened based on the highest zone of hydrolysis followed by PHB depolymerase activity. Soil burial method was employed to check their degradation ability at different incubation periods of 15, 30, and 45 days at 37±2°C, pH 7.0 at 60% moisture with 1% microbial inoculum of Aeromonas caviae Kuk1-(34) (MN414252). Without optimized conditions, 85.76% of the total weight of the PHB film was degraded after 45 days. This degradation was confirmed with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The presence of bacterial colonies on the surface of the degraded film, along with crest, holes, surface erosion, and roughness, were visible. Media optimization was carried out in statistical mode using Plackett Burman (PB) and Central Composite Design (CCD) of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) by considering ten different factors. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Pareto chart, response surface plots, and F-value of 3.82 implies that the above statistical model was significant. The best production of PHB depolymerase enzyme (14.98 U/mL) was observed when strain Kuk1-(34) was grown in a media containing 0.1% PHB, K2HPO4 (1.6 gm/L) at 27 ℃ for seven days. Exploiting these statistically optimized conditions, the culture was found to be a suitable candidate for the management of solid waste, where 94.4% of the total weight of the PHB film was degraded after 45 days of incubation."
https://openalex.org/W4224004629,"Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) plays a major role in the development of cervical cancer. The oncogenic potential of HPV16 is attributed to E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Here, we investigated the relationship between fused toes homolog (FTS) and HPV16 E6 and E7 in cervical cancer cells. HPV16-positive CaSki and SiHa cell lines were used for in vitro studies. FTS silencing was performed using a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based approach, and western blotting was performed to determine the protein expression of tumor suppressors and cell survival markers. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, in silico analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the interaction between, and intracellular co-localization of, FTS and both the E6 and E7 proteins. Silencing of FTS reduced the expression of the E6 and E7 proteins in cervical cancer cell lines and conversely increased the expression of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and retinoblastoma protein. However, the primary transcripts of HPV16 E6 and E7 were unaffected by FTS silencing; furthermore, FTS transcription was unaffected by silencing of either E6 or E7, suggesting their interaction occurs post-translationally. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated co-localization of FTS with the HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins, while immunoprecipitation results suggested that FTS interacts with both E6 and E7. Furthermore, in silico structural analysis identified putative residues involved in the binding of FTS with E6 and E7. Taken together, these results show that FTS affects both HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes in cervical cancer. We propose FTS as a target for the prevention of cervical cancer development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W4224014158,"Healthcare-associated infections are resulting in human morbidity and mortality worldwide. These infections are directly proportional to increased multidrug resistance (MDR), which limits antibiotic treatment and make the treatment of infections challenging. Streptomyces spp. are well known to produce various biologically active compounds. Therefore, these are considered as promising biological control agents against wide range of bacterial pathogens. This study was conducted to isolate and identify the most efficient antibiotic-producing Streptomyces St 45 isolate against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29737, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC25566, E. coli 0157h7 ATCC25922 and Bacillus subtilis. A total 40 soil and 10 water (from wells) samples were processed using standard microbiological techniques at King Faisal Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The selected Streptomyces St 45 isolate was grown to produce biologically active metabolites, and the minimum concentration (MIC) was determined. Sixty isolates with antibacterial properties were selected. The 16s rRNA gene analysis was used to identify the strongest Streptomyces St 45 strain. The highest zone of inhibition (ZOI) was provided by 'MUJA10' strain of S. exfoliatus against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29737 (51.33 ± 2.15 mm). The MIC value of 'MUJA10' metabolite of S. exfoliatus strain against Salmonella typhimurium ATCC25566 and E. coli 0157h7 ATCC25922 was 0.125 mg/ml. However, Bacillus subtilis had a MIC of 0.625 mg/ml and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29737 had a MIC of 2.5 mg/ml. In conclusion, Streptomyces exfoliatus strain 'MUJA10' obtained from soil exhibited high inhibitory potential against human pathogens. The 16s rRNA gene analysis revealed that Streptomyces St 45 isolate was similar to Streptomyces exfoliatus A156.7 with 98% similarity and confirmed as Streptomyces exfoliates 'MUJA10' at gene bank with gene accession number OL720257."
https://openalex.org/W4224091184,"Social functioning is often impaired in schizophrenia (SZ) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, commonalities and differences in social dysfunction among these patient groups remain elusive.Using data from the PRISM study, behavioral (all subscales and total score of the Social Functioning Scale) and affective (perceived social disability and loneliness) indicators of social functioning were measured in patients with SZ (N = 56), probable AD (N = 50) and age-matched healthy controls groups (HC, N = 29 and N = 28). We examined to what extent social functioning differed between disease and age-matched HC groups, as well as between patient groups. Furthermore, we examined how severity of disease and mood were correlated with social functioning, irrespective of diagnosis.As compared to HC, both behavioral and affective social functioning seemed impaired in SZ patients (Cohen's d's 0.81-1.69), whereas AD patients mainly showed impaired behavioral social function (Cohen's d's 0.65-1.14). While behavioral indices of social functioning were similar across patient groups, SZ patients reported more perceived social disability than AD patients (Cohen's d's 0.65). Across patient groups, positive mood, lower depression and anxiety levels were strong determinants of better social functioning (p's <0.001), even more so than severity of disease.AD and SZ patients both exhibit poor social functioning in comparison to age- and sex matched HC participants. Social dysfunction in SZ patients may be more severe than in AD patients, though this may be due to underreporting by AD patients. Across patients, social functioning appeared as more influenced by mood states than by severity of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4224095250,"eHealth has grown exponentially alongside technology and has become widely accessed by some populations, but little is documented about how undergraduate students use eHealth or perceive their eHealth literacy. As access to online information and non-traditional options for interacting with providers has increased, patient views of the provider-patient relationship may also be changing. This study evaluates how frequently undergraduates use eHealth, how they perceive their ability to use eHealth appropriately, and how they view their patient-provider relationships. A mixed methods approach was used to address the research questions, with quantitative data from a survey and qualitative data from follow-up interviews of twelve of the survey respondents. The survey was distributed to over 650 undergraduate students in introductory biology laboratory courses for students of all fields of interest at one university. Based on 527 survey responses and 12 interviews, students reported commonly using eHealth but being skeptical of telehealth appointments. Although students generally felt capable of finding and interpreting eHealth sources, they were not strongly confident in their ability to do so. Use of eHealth was not seen as altering the patient-provider relationship, but students expressed a desire for their physician to act more as a counselor or advisor than a guardian. Students from minority populations were more likely to use eHealth in comparison to their peers. In addition, student comfort with their provider differed by race and ethnicity, as well as whether they shared the same gender identity as their provider. This research highlights how undergraduate students, who are often making medical decisions for themselves for the first time as adults, access health information and view the patient-provider relationship differently than the traditional guardian or paternalistic model. In addition, having diverse, culturally competent medical providers are critical for students to develop the relationship with their provider that they desire."
https://openalex.org/W4224107500,"Background Scholars have associated happiness with health behaviors, which co-occur and exert synergistic effects. Therefore, identifying clusters of health behaviors and their effect on happiness can contribute to the development of strategies for promoting happiness and improving health behaviors. Aim This study aimed to examine clusters of health behaviors and their associations with socio-demographics and with happiness among Japanese adults. Methods This study used data from the Japanese Household Panel Survey and the Keio Household Panel Survey. Questionnaires were distributed to 4,993 households out of which 1,554 responses were analyzed (participants aged 27−65 years). The survey included health behaviors (alcohol consumption, smoking, vegetable and fruit consumption, breakfast-eating habits, and physical activities), happiness, and socio-demographics. Latent class analysis was conducted to identify the clusters, whereas latent regression was employed to investigate socio-demographics related to the clusters. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relation between happiness and the clusters. Results Two health behavior clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (low substance use and good dietary habit; n = 817; 52.3%) and Cluster 2 (high alcohol, poor nutrition, and inactive; n = 737; 47.7%). Latent regression analysis indicated that all socio-demographics, barring socioeconomic status, were significantly associated with the clusters. The “low substance use and good dietary habit” cluster was significantly related with higher odds of happiness (odds ratio = 1.425, 95% confidence interval = 1.146−1.772, p = 0.001). Conclusions This study identified health behavior clusters among Japanese adults and established the association between the “low substance use and good dietary habit” cluster and high levels of happiness. However, the causality of the relationship between health behavior and happiness remains unclear, which highlights the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."

The cause of mortality among these patients is mostly related to the dominant presence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity. The aim of the current study is therefore to determine the prevalence of obesity and its associated factors among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at Sidama region, Ethiopia.Institution-based cross-sectional study design was implemented to determine the prevalence of obesity and its associated factor among patients with type two diabetes at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital and Yirgalem General Hospital from October 16 2018 to December 21, 2018. A simple random sampling technique was implemented to select 314 study participants. After obtaining consent, different patients' related data were collected using a questionnaire. Patients' records were also reviewed. 4ml of the blood sample was collected from each study participant and analyzed for lipid profile test. Blood glucose level was done using COBAS INTEGRA 6000. A binary logistic regression was used to assess factors that have an association with obesity. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.The majority of the study participants (67.2%) were male and 61.8% of the study participants were aged >45years. The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity among the study participants was 36.3% and 18.8% respectively. About 41% of the study participants have a normal BMI. Females were more obese (28.2% Vs 14.2%) than males and BMI stratification by sex was statistically significant (P = 0.02). Sex (AOR = 3.0, CI = 1.6-5.7, P-Value = 0.001) and TG (AOR = 3.6, CI = 1.6-8.3, P-Value = 0.003) are factors that were independently associated with obesity among type 2 DM patients.Overweight and obesity among type two diabetic patients were prevalent.

Because of the significant brittleness and low strength of carbide-slag-stabilized soil, fibers were added to carbide-slag-stabilized soil in this experimental study. The effects of fiber length and fiber content on the unconfined compressive and indirect tensile strengths of carbide-slag-stabilized soil were investigated. The concepts of the density of fibers in solidified soil and the number of fibers in a unit volume solidified soil were proposed, and the effects of fiber distribution density on the mechanical properties of the solidified soil were evaluated. The fibers increased the indirect tensile strength of the carbide-slag-solidified soil, which was significantly higher than the unconfined compressive strength of the solidified soil. The fibers had no significant effect on the unconfined compressive and indirect tensile strengths of the 7 d carbide-slag-solidified soil but increased those of the 28 d carbide-slag-solidified soil. The enhancement effect was the most significant when a 0.3% content of 19 mm long fibers was incorporated into the carbide-slag-solidified soil."

A self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was administered to key stakeholders to assess the attributes and process of operation of the surveillance system using CDC's Updated Guidelines for Evaluation of Public Health Surveillance System 2001. Data collected alongside surveillance data from March 2020 to January 2021 were analyzed and summarized using descriptive statistics.Out of 69,338 suspected cases, 12,595 tested positive with RT-PCR with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 18%. Healthcare workers were identified as high-risk group with a prevalence of 23.5%. About 82% respondents perceived the system to be simple, 85.5% posited that the system was flexible and easily accommodates changes, 71.4% reported that the system was acceptable and expressed willingness to continue participation. Representativeness of the system was 93%, stability 40%, data quality 56.2% and timeliness 45.5%, estimated result turnaround time (TAT) was suboptimal.The system was found to be useful, simple, flexible, sensitive, acceptable, with good representativeness but the stability, data quality and timeliness was poor. The system meets initial surveillance objectives but rapid expansion of sample collection and testing sites, improvement of TAT, sustainable funding, improvement of electronic database, continuous provision of logistics, supplies and additional trainings are needed to address identified weaknesses, optimize the system performance and meet increasing need of case detection in the wake of rapidly spreading pandemic.

https://openalex.org/W4223927259,"Most proteins perform their biological function by interacting with one or more molecular partners. In this respect, characterizing local features of the molecular surface, that can potentially be involved in the interaction with other molecules, represents a step forward in the investigation of the mechanisms of recognition and binding between molecules. Predictive methods often rely on extensive samplings of molecular patches with the aim to identify hot spots on the surface. In this framework, analysis of large proteins and/or many molecular dynamics frames is often unfeasible due to the high computational cost. Thus, finding optimal ways to reduce the number of points to be sampled maintaining the biological information (including the surface shape) carried by the molecular surface is pivotal. In this perspective, we here present a new theoretical and computational algorithm with the aim of defining a set of molecular surfaces composed of points not uniformly distributed in space, in such a way as to maximize the information of the overall shape of the molecule by minimizing the number of total points. We test our procedure's ability in recognizing hot-spots by describing the local shape properties of portions of molecular surfaces through a recently developed method based on the formalism of 2D Zernike polynomials. The results of this work show the ability of the proposed algorithm to preserve the key information of the molecular surface using a reduced number of points compared to the complete surface, where all points of the surface are used for the description. In fact, the methodology shows a significant gain of the information stored in the sampling procedure compared to uniform random sampling."

The present study describes the screening of lectin activity from ten local mushrooms, namely, Amanita zambiana , Boletus edulis , Cantharellus heinemannianus , Cantharellus miomboensis , Cantharellus symoensii , Lactarius kabansus , Amanita sp., Coprinus sp., Ganoderma lucidum and Trametes strumosa . The lectin content was detected by the haemagglutination activity of mushrooms against sheep and goat erythrocytes. Among the different mushrooms screened Amanita sp., Boletus edulis and Lactarius kabansus showed high lectin activity (39, 617 and 77 HAU/mg mushroom, respectively). Boletus edulis was used for the haemagglutination inhibition assay. A total of twenty sugars and sugar derivatives, namely, α-lactose, D-glucose, D-mannose, D-raffinose, N-acetyl glucosamine, maltose, melibiose, D-ribose, porcine mucin, D-cellobiose, D-arabinose, α-methyl-D-glucoside, methyl-α-D-mannopyranoside, D-trehalose, L-arabinose, L-sorbose, L-lyxose, β-lactose, DL-xylose, and D-galactose, were used for the haemagglutination inhibition assay. Of the various carbohydrates tested, only porcine mucin was found to be the most potent inhibitor of Boletus lectin. The lectin from Boletus mushroom was partially purified using ammonium sulphate precipitation. The highest lectin activity was observed in the 30%-60% fraction. This study revealed for the first time the occurrence of lectins in the local Zimbabwean mushrooms studied as well as isolation of a novel mucin-specific lectin. The information obtained can be used for further investigation of cell surface sugars, purification and characterisation of glycoproteins and their contribution towards the medicinal properties of local mushrooms."
https://openalex.org/W4224035636,"In meiosis, cells undergo two sequential rounds of cell division, termed meiosis I and meiosis II. Textbook models of the meiosis I substage called pachytene show that nuclei have conspicuous 100-nm-wide, ladder-like synaptonemal complexes and ordered chromatin loops. It remains unknown if these cells have any other large, meiosis-related intranuclear structures. Here we present cryo-ET analysis of frozen-hydrated budding yeast cells before, during, and after pachytene. We found no cryo-ET densities that resemble dense ladder-like structures or ordered chromatin loops. Instead, we found large numbers of 12-nm-wide triple-helices that pack into ordered bundles. These structures, herein called meiotic triple helices (MTHs), are present in meiotic cells, but not in interphase cells. MTHs are enriched in the nucleus but not enriched in the cytoplasm. Bundles of MTHs form at the same timeframe as synaptonemal complexes (SCs) in wild-type cells and in mutant cells that are unable to form SCs. These results suggest that in yeast, SCs coexist with previously unreported large, ordered assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W4224064583,"Social relationships are important predictors of a range of individual outcomes, such as wellbeing and health. These social relationships are conceptualised in different ways, such as (inter-personal) forms of social support, identification with groups, or social capital. What is the overlap among these concepts and in what ways do they differ? The present work aims to clarify this with empirical evidence from two panel studies (N = 3934; N = 2912). The studies include central measures of social relationships (group identification, group membership, social support and social capital). Empirical differences and overlap were studied by evaluating the factor structure of the data with both confirmatory factor analyses and bi-factor analyses. Results showed that the different concepts had a large amount of empirical overlap (together accounting for over 60% of common variance). Surprisingly, results also revealed that subcomponents were identifiable based on who they target and not based on their conceptualisation. For example, items about identification with neighbourhood factored together with support items from the neighbourhood, and not with other identification items. Accordingly, we conclude that in addition to a general factor, it is possible to meaningfully distinguish components of social relations based on which group is targeted by the items (e.g. neighbourhood or family and friends). For future research on the relationship between social relations and health, the present measures are unlikely to be sufficiently precise to disentangle whether health effects are caused by identification, support or capital. Differences between targets appear to be more important than differences between these concepts for understanding the relationship between social relations and health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W4224104106,"Purpose We examined the effects of aging and exercise habits on the ocular blood flow (OBF) and its profiles throughout the optic nerve head region and choroidal area. We hypothesized that exercise habits reduce the stiffness of vessels in the ocular circulation, which generally increases with aging. Methods Participants in a medical checkup program (698 males and 192 females aged 28 to 80 years) were categorized into 2 groups (with and without exercise habits) based on participant self-reporting and the definition of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan (MHLW). OBF in the right eye was measured and analyzed using laser speckle flowgraphy. The blowout time (BOT), which is the time during which the blood flow is higher than half of the mean of the minimum and maximum signals during one heartbeat, was calculated as an index of the blood flow profile. BOT has been used as an indicator of the flexibility of blood vessels. Results BOT significantly decreased with aging. Neither the self-reported nor MHLW-based exercise habits significantly affected the ocular circulation. Conclusion These results indicate that the stiffness of the ocular vessels increases with aging, and this cannot be prevented by exercise habits."

Bacteria adapt to their environment to overcome these antibacterial effects through undefined mechanisms. In Gram-negative bacteria, drug efflux systems are associated with resistance to various substances. Studies have identified multiple drug efflux systems in Salmonella enterica . The aim of this study was to investigate whether drug efflux systems contribute to fatty acid salts resistance in S . enterica . We used deletion and overexpressing strains of S . enterica for drug efflux transporters. Susceptibility to fatty acid salts was determined by measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations and performing growth assays. Our findings revealed that acrAB , acrEF , emrAB and tolC in S . enterica contribute resistance to fatty acid salts. Furthermore, EmrAB, which is known to function with TolC, contributes to the fatty acid salts resistance of S . enterica in a TolC-independent manner. This study revealed that drug efflux systems confer fatty acid satls resistance to S . enterica . Notably, although EmrAB is normally associated with antimicrobial resistance in a TolC-dependent manner, it was found to be involved in fatty acid salts resistance in a TolC-independent manner, indicating that the utilization of TolC by EmrAB is substrate dependent in S . enterica ."
https://openalex.org/W4223910278,"Individuals with Profound Intellectual and Multiple Disabilities (PIMD) experience a combination of severe cognitive and motor impairments frequently associated with additional sensory deficits and numerous medical disorders. The purpose of the present study was to propose an experimental paradigm based on eye-tracking that combines various pre-existing tasks from infancy research as an assessment tool. This would enable the investigation of social-emotional abilities in nine young individuals with PIMD through their visual preferences for different types of stimuli. The first objective was to test the feasibility of this paradigm, by expecting individuals to look more at the tasks’ presentation screen than elsewhere during its implementation. The second objective was to investigate whether PIMD individuals exhibit visual preferences for (a) biological (vs. non-biological) motion, (b) socially salient (vs. non-social) scenes, (c) the facial area of the eyes (vs. the mouth), (d) happy (vs. angry) faces, (e) objects of joint attention (vs. non-looked at ones), and for (f) prosocial (vs. anti-social) behaviors similar to those of a control group of typically developing children aged two years on average. Overall, the feasibility of this paradigm proved to be good, resulting in high individual looking rates that were not affected by the presentation or the content of the tasks. Analyses of individual social-emotional abilities, supported by the visual preference patterns of each PIMD individual, firstly revealed strong—but expected—variability both within and between subjects, and secondly highlighted some individual task-specific abilities although few similarities between these individual results and those of the control group were found. These findings underline the great relevance of using this type of paradigm for assessing PIMD individuals and thus contribute to a better understanding of their social and emotional development."
https://openalex.org/W4223914408,"To solve the problem of the inability of traditional spray dust removal technology to efficiently restrain dust diffusion at the heading face, a multilayer spiral fog curtain dust control method based on spirally arranged pneumatic nozzles is proposed. In this paper, the k-ɛ turbulence model and K-H droplet breakage model are used. First, different airflow fields are analyzed by simulating the simultaneous injection of different numbers of nozzles, and the motion law of airflow interaction is obtained. Taking the two-layer fog curtain as an example, a multiphysical field coupling numerical simulation of the two-layer spiral fog curtain applied in the field is carried out, and the variation law of its velocity field distribution and particle motion characteristics is analyzed. A similar experimental platform is established to verify the effectiveness of the simulation results and the feasibility of the dust removal scheme. The simulation results show that the double helix arrangement will form a rotating airflow with the cutting arm as the axis to cover the whole roadway section and produce a double-layer spiral fog curtain. The water mist is fragmented into smaller fog droplets under the action of rotating airflow, which improves the dust catching effect of the fog curtain. Experiments show that the dust removal rate and efficiency of multilayer spiral fog curtains are obviously stronger than those of natural dust reduction and traditional spray. After 3 minutes, a dust concentration of approximately 470 mg/m3 can be reduced to less than 4 mg/m3. The average dust removal rates of total dust and exhaled dust were 2.600 mg/(m3.s) and 0.189 mg/(m3.s), respectively, and the dust removal efficiencies were 97.01% and 94.32%."
https://openalex.org/W4223940053,"A published range of reactions to the tuberculin skin test (TST) using mammalian (human) old tuberculin (MOT) in a population of Mauritius origin Macaca fascicularis in US laboratory animal medicine does not exist. The objectives of this report are to quantify the reactions among juvenile, adolescent, and male adult cynomolgus macaques and to provide the laboratory animal medicine practitioner with a reference range of reactions to MOT in Mauritian juvenile macaques. Monkeys in a US foreign animal quarantine must be tested negative for mycobacterial infection including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using MOT as required by the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. The TST relies on visual observation post injection of an individual animal's reaction or nonreaction. During 2017, 933 Mauritius origin macaques from one supplier were quarantined in nine separate cohorts in our facility. 848 or > 90% of the animals were juveniles between 1.5 to 3 years of age, comprised of 425 males and 423 females. The population also included 46 adolescents (21 males, 25 females) and 39 adult males. A total of 33 TST sets were performed on the nine cohorts, resulting in 3418 individual TSTs being administered. 1595 (46.6%) injections were made in juvenile males and 1529 (44.7%) in juvenile females. A total of 172 reactions to the TST were recorded at the final assessment completed at the 72-hour post injection time point from all animal ages and sexes. 162 reactions (94.2% of all reactions) occurred in juvenile animals, consisting of 96 bruises (59.3% of all juvenile reactions) in males and 58 bruises (35.8% of all juvenile reactions) in females. Bruising was the most common reaction in juvenile animals and in all animals regardless of age or sex. Bruising occurred within all 33 TST sets ranging from a low of 0% to a high of 30% in male juveniles and a low of 0% to a high of 17% in female juveniles. Bruising was the only finding in the adolescents and adult males. Erythema was observed only in juvenile animals, two males and three females. Generalized eyelid edema was observed only in juvenile animals, one male and one female. These animals had concurrent erythema in the affected eyelid. Animals with generalized eyelid edema and erythema are considered suspect for active tuberculosis and warrant further diagnostics. In this report, the most observed reaction among all age groups and sexes was bruising. Erythema and edema were rarely observed. Only juvenile animals were observed with either erythema, edema or both."
https://openalex.org/W4223965599,"Interdisciplinary scientific collaboration promotes the innovative development of scientific research. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is a typical interdisciplinary subject. This study aims to explore the characteristics of discipline interaction and the temporal evolution in the field. Bibliometric analysis could be used to understand the stage of research in a particular subject. In this work, the publications on the topic in Web of Science (WoS) platform from 1999 to 2020 were selected. On the basis of social network theory, the characteristics of interdisciplinary were revealed from three perspectives. First, the disciplinary interaction network is constructed through disciplinary co-occurrence to detect the characteristics of interaction structure among different disciplines. Then the node centrality index is employed to explore the influence of disciplines in the interactive network by using network centrality analysis. Moreover, the dynamic of discipline interaction evolution is studied using blockmodeling analysis. In the field of PHE, the number of disciplines and the intensity of interaction among different subjects gradually increased in the past 20 years. Chemistry and Material Sciences are the core discipline, and they play an important role in the network. The whole network is divided into different discipline groups. The scale of the discipline group is becoming large, and the disciplinary interaction is becoming more complex. The obtained results are helpful for guiding scholars to carry out interdisciplinary interaction. The methods of detecting interdisciplinary interactive relationship could provide paths for interdisciplinary research in other fields."
https://openalex.org/W4223965838,"Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic, and the United States and European authorities established criteria for the release of COVID-19 patients from isolation in October 2020. However, a huge discrepancy exists between the hospital-discharge protocol for COVID-19 patients and the release of patients from in-hospital isolation. Our initially proposed criteria for in-hospital release from isolation was not adhered to by healthcare workers (HCWs) due to prevailing concerns regarding disease infectivity. Herein, we report difficulties encountered in attempting to establish a common understanding of the management of emerging infections. Methods We performed a Google Form-based questionnaire survey targeting HCWs from Okayama University Hospital, Japan, via e-mail on January 21–28, 2021. The anonymous investigation required respondents to provide information regarding their background as well as perceptions regarding the requirement, level of understanding, and readiness for developing release criteria. Results We obtained 150 eligible responses, including 57 (38.0%) from medical doctors and 53 (35.3%) from nurses. Most HCWs managing COVID-19 patients advocated for the implementation of the criteria, whereas those not working in that capacity did not ( p &lt;0.001). Over half of the HCWs indicated discomfort at seeing COVID-19 patients transitioning to general management even after meeting the criteria. Conclusions It was challenging to establish a common understanding regarding the ideal criteria for in-hospital release of COVID-19 patients from isolation in our hospital. The dissemination of our experiences and multifaceted discussions with HCWs would be of great value as a countermeasure against the emergent pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4223971728,"We give exact Green's functions in two space dimensions. We work in a scaled domain that is a circle of unit radius with a smaller circular ""inclusion"", of radius a, removed, without restriction on the size or position of the inclusion. We consider the two cases where one of the two boundaries is absorbing and the other is reflecting. Given a particle with diffusivity D, in a circle with radius R, the mean time to reach the absorbing boundary is a function of the initial condition, given by the integral of Green's function over the domain. We scale to a circle of unit radius, then transform to bipolar coordinates. We show the equivalence of two different series expansions, and obtain closed expressions that are not series expansions."
https://openalex.org/W4224018024,"Background Antidepressant use has been associated with increased fall risk. Antidepressant-related adverse drug reactions (e.g. orthostatic hypotension) depend partly on genetic variation. We hypothesized that candidate genetic polymorphisms are associated with fall risk in older antidepressant users. Methods The association between antidepressant use and falls was cross-sectionally investigated in a cohort of Dutch older adults by logistic regression analyses. In case of significant interaction product term of antidepressant use and candidate polymorphism, the association between the variant genotype and fall risk was assessed within antidepressant users and the association between antidepressant use and fall risk was investigated stratified per genotype. Secondly, a look-up of the candidate genes was performed in an existing genome-wide association study on drug-related falls in antidepressant users within the UK Biobank. In antidepressant users, genetic associations for our candidate polymorphisms for fall history were investigated. Results In antidepressant users(n = 566), for rs28371725 ( CYP2D6*41 ) fall risk was decreased in TC/variant allele carriers compared to CC/non-variant allele carriers (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.80). Concerning rs1057910 ( CYP2C9*3 ), fall risk was increased in CA/variant allele carriers compared to AA/non-variant allele carriers (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.17–3.27). Regarding, rs1045642 ( ABCB1 ), fall risk was increased in AG/variant allele carriers compared to GG/non-variant allele carriers (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.07–2.69). Concerning the ABCB1 -haplotype (rs1045642/rs1128503), fall risk was increased in AA-AA/variant allele carriers compared to GG-GG/non-variant allele carriers (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.05–3.29). In the UK Biobank, in antidepressant users(n = 34,000) T/variant-allele of rs28371725 ( CYP2D*41 ) was associated with increased fall risk (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.12). G/non-variant-allele of rs4244285 ( CY2C19*2 ) was associated with decreased risk (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–1.00). Conclusion This is the first study showing that certain genetic variants modify antidepressant-related fall risk. The results were not always consistent across the studies and should be validated in a study with a prospective design. However, pharmacogenetics might have value in antidepressant (de)prescribing in falls prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4224021188,"Recent evidence suggested the link between nephrolithiasis and renal function impairment. We aimed to determine the renal function profile and potential factors associated with reduced renal function amongst renal stone formers in multi-ethnic Asians.We conducted a cross-sectional study involving patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy between May 2015 and December 2019. Reduced renal function was defined as having estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Renal stone samples were collected and quantified using infrared spectroscopy. Potential factors associated with reduced renal function including age, ethnicity, educational level, history of diabetes, hypertension, gout, hydronephrosis, serum uric acid level, and type of renal stone were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses.A total of 1162 patients from a multi-ethnic population (Malays 67%, Chinese 19%, Indians 13% and indigenous people 1%) with median age of 57 years (Interquartile range 48-64) were enrolled in the study. Almost a third of patients were found with reduced renal function. Multivariable analysis showed that the odds of having reduced renal function increased with age, ethnicity, lower educational level, history of diabetes, hypertension, gout, bilateral hydronephrosis, elevated serum uric acid level and infection stone.Reduced renal function varies between ethnicities and all age groups of renal stone formers. In addition to age and ethnicity, cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes and hypertension may also need to be taken into account in managing stone patients with reduced renal function."
https://openalex.org/W4224047536,"Most action recognition tasks now treat the activity as a single event in a video clip. Recently, the benefits of representing activities as a combination of verbs and nouns for action recognition have shown to be effective in improving action understanding, allowing us to capture such representations. However, there is still a lack of research on representational learning using cross-view or cross-modality information. To exploit the complementary information between multiple views, we propose a feature fusion framework, and our framework is divided into two steps: extraction of appearance features and fusion of multi-view features. We validate our approach on two action recognition datasets, IKEA ASM and LEMMA. We demonstrate that multi-view fusion can effectively generalize across appearances and identify previously unseen actions of interacting objects, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, on the IKEA ASM dataset, the performance of the multi-view fusion approach improves 18.1% over the performance of the single-view approach on top-1."
https://openalex.org/W4224054197,"From CEOs confronting competition to children playing board games, our professional and personal lives are full of dynamic decisions. Naturally, while playing the role of a decision-maker, people differ. To comprehend and analyze how they differ, first it is necessary to construct a profiling method that classifies dynamic decision-makers. Developing such a method is the main objective of our article. We equate dynamic decision-making with backward inducting. We rely on response times to construct the profiles. Our method has both descriptive power and predictive power: a subject's profile resembles her reasoning process and forecasts the likelihood of her correctly backward inducting. To test the proposed profiling method, we use data generated by 22 different finite dynamic scenarios from the mobile app Blues and Reds. Our sample consists of 35,826 observations from 6,463 subjects located in 141 countries. We construct the profiles of our subjects, and, in a variety of exercises supported by an array of robustness checks, we successfully establish the predictive power of our profiling method."
https://openalex.org/W4224064159,"Background Even though adherence to dietary counselling for patients with diabetes is essential for improving health and preventing complications, access to an adequate and quality diet is challenging for patients living in a food-insecure household. The availability of data in this regard is limited in Ethiopia. Thus, this study assessed the food security status of patients with type 2 diabetes, their adherence to dietary counselling, and contributing factors at public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods This was a facility-based cross-sectional study among 602 patients with Type 2 diabetes in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from July to August 2019. Patients were selected randomly after the total number of samples was proportionally allocated to four public hospitals. Relevant information was collected by trained data collectors using a pre-tested questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi-info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 24 for data analysis. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with adherence to dietary counselling. Result The proportion of nonadherence to dietary counselling among patients with type 2 diabetes was 67.3% (95%CI: 63.5%-71.1%). Nearly half (50.7%) of the respondents were food insecure. Of these, mildly food insecure, moderately food insecure, and severely food insecure were 8.5%, 29.2%, and 13%, respectively. Physical activity (AOR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.1–2.9); diabetes knowledge (AOR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.2–2.6); lack of access to information (AOR = 1.6; 95%CI: 1.1–2.6); moderately food insecure (AOR = 2.2; 95%CI: 1.3–3.7); and severely food insecure (AOR = 5.6; 95%CI: 2.1–15.0) were the major significant factors associated with nonadherence to dietary counselling. Conclusion Over two-thirds of patients with diabetes did not adhere to dietary counselling, which appears high. As a result, improving diabetes education, information access, and food security status should be considered to ensure dietary counselling adherence among type 2 diabetes patients."
