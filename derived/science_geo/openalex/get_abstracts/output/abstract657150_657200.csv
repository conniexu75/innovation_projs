https://openalex.org/W3047141442,"RNA velocity has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation. scVelo reconstructs transient cell states and differentiation pathways from single-cell RNA-sequencing data."
https://openalex.org/W3046809066,"Abstract Artemisinin resistance (delayed P. falciparum clearance following artemisinin-based combination therapy), is widespread across Southeast Asia but to date has not been reported in Africa 1–4 . Here we genotyped the P. falciparum K13 ( Pfkelch13 ) propeller domain, mutations in which can mediate artemisinin resistance 5,6 , in pretreatment samples collected from recent dihydroarteminisin-piperaquine and artemether-lumefantrine efficacy trials in Rwanda 7 . While cure rates were &gt;95% in both treatment arms, the Pfkelch13 R561H mutation was identified in 19 of 257 (7.4%) patients at Masaka. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the expansion of an indigenous R561H lineage. Gene editing confirmed that this mutation can drive artemisinin resistance in vitro. This study provides evidence for the de novo emergence of Pfkelch13 -mediated artemisinin resistance in Rwanda, potentially compromising the continued success of antimalarial chemotherapy in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3046671820,"Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer1,2. In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), TP53 mutations are associated with high-risk disease3,4, rapid transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)5, resistance to conventional therapies6–8 and dismal outcomes9. Consistent with the tumor-suppressive role of TP53, patients harbor both mono- and biallelic mutations10. However, the biological and clinical implications of TP53 allelic state have not been fully investigated in MDS or any other cancer type. We analyzed 3,324 patients with MDS for TP53 mutations and allelic imbalances and delineated two subsets of patients with distinct phenotypes and outcomes. One-third of TP53-mutated patients had monoallelic mutations whereas two-thirds had multiple hits (multi-hit) consistent with biallelic targeting. Established associations with complex karyotype, few co-occurring mutations, high-risk presentation and poor outcomes were specific to multi-hit patients only. TP53 multi-hit state predicted risk of death and leukemic transformation independently of the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)11. Surprisingly, monoallelic patients did not differ from TP53 wild-type patients in outcomes and response to therapy. This study shows that consideration of TP53 allelic state is critical for diagnostic and prognostic precision in MDS as well as in future correlative studies of treatment response. Clinical sequencing across a large prospective cohort of patients with myelodysplasic syndrome uncovers distinct associations between the mono- and biallelic states of TP53 and clinical presentation"
https://openalex.org/W3046236678,"Targeted protein degradation is a new therapeutic modality based on drugs that destabilize proteins by inducing their proximity to E3 ubiquitin ligases. Of particular interest are molecular glues that can degrade otherwise unligandable proteins by orchestrating direct interactions between target and ligase. However, their discovery has so far been serendipitous, thus hampering broad translational efforts. Here, we describe a scalable strategy toward glue degrader discovery that is based on chemical screening in hyponeddylated cells coupled to a multi-omics target deconvolution campaign. This approach led us to identify compounds that induce ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin K by prompting an interaction of CDK12–cyclin K with a CRL4B ligase complex. Notably, this interaction is independent of a dedicated substrate receptor, thus functionally segregating this mechanism from all described degraders. Collectively, our data outline a versatile and broadly applicable strategy to identify degraders with nonobvious mechanisms and thus empower future drug discovery efforts. Chemical profiling in hyponeddylated cells coupled with multi-omics target deconvolution led to the identification of molecular glue degraders of cyclin K that function by inducing proximity between the CRL adaptor DDB1 and a CDK12–cyclin K complex."
https://openalex.org/W3047418547,"Remote memories depend on coordinated activity in the hippocampus and frontal cortices, but the timeline of these interactions is debated. Astrocytes sense and modify neuronal activity, but their role in remote memory is scarcely explored. We expressed the Gi-coupled designer receptor hM4Di in CA1 astrocytes and discovered that astrocytic manipulation during learning specifically impaired remote, but not recent, memory recall and decreased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during retrieval. We revealed massive recruitment of ACC-projecting CA1 neurons during memory acquisition, which was accompanied by the activation of ACC neurons. Astrocytic Gi activation disrupted CA3 to CA1 communication in vivo and reduced the downstream response in the ACC. In behaving mice, it induced a projection-specific inhibition of CA1-to-ACC neurons during learning, which consequently prevented ACC recruitment. Finally, direct inhibition of CA1-to-ACC-projecting neurons spared recent and impaired remote memory. Our findings suggest that remote memory acquisition involves projection-specific functions of astrocytes in regulating CA1-to-ACC neuronal communication."

https://openalex.org/W3047068833,"Response and resistance to anticancer therapies vary due to intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity1. Here, we map differentially enriched G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structure-forming regions (∆G4Rs) in 22 breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models. ∆G4Rs are associated with the promoters of highly amplified genes showing high expression, and with somatic single-nucleotide variants. Differences in ΔG4R landscapes reveal seven transcription factor programs across PDTXs. ∆G4R abundance and locations stratify PDTXs into at least three G4-based subtypes. ∆G4Rs in most PDTXs (14 of 22) were found to associate with more than one breast cancer subtype, which we also call an integrative cluster (IC)2. This suggests the frequent coexistence of multiple breast cancer states within a PDTX model, the majority of which display aggressive triple-negative IC10 gene activity. Short-term cultures of PDTX models with increased ∆G4R levels are more sensitive to small molecules targeting G4 DNA. Thus, G4 landscapes reveal additional IC-related intratumor heterogeneity in PDTX biopsies, improving breast cancer stratification and potentially identifying new treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3046360811,"Maintaining healthy body weight is increasingly difficult in our obesogenic environment. Dieting efforts are often overpowered by the internal drive to consume energy-dense foods. Although the selection of calorically rich substrates over healthier options is identifiable across species, the mechanisms behind this choice remain poorly understood. Using a passive devaluation paradigm, we found that exposure to high-fat diet (HFD) suppresses the intake of nutritionally balanced standard chow diet (SD) irrespective of age, sex, body mass accrual and functional leptin or melanocortin-4 receptor signaling. Longitudinal recordings revealed that this SD devaluation and subsequent shift toward HFD consumption is encoded at the level of hypothalamic agouti-related peptide neurons and mesolimbic dopamine signaling. Prior HFD consumption vastly diminished the capacity of SD to alleviate the negative valence associated with hunger and the rewarding properties of food discovery even after periods of HFD abstinence. These data reveal a neural basis behind the hardships of dieting. Mazzone and Liang-Guallpa et al. demonstrate that consuming high-fat foods rapidly and durably tunes parallel brain circuits to drive intake of a high-fat diet while devaluing a nutritionally balanced, standard diet even under states of intense hunger."

https://openalex.org/W3047143891,"Certain mutagens, including the APOBEC3 (A3) cytosine deaminase enzymes, can create multiple genetic changes in a single event. Activity of A3s results in striking ‘mutation showers’ occurring near DNA breakpoints; however, less is known about the mechanisms underlying the majority of A3 mutations. We classified the diverse patterns of clustered mutagenesis in tumor genomes, which identified a new A3 pattern: nonrecurrent, diffuse hypermutation (omikli). This mechanism occurs independently of the known focal hypermutation (kataegis), and is associated with activity of the DNA mismatch-repair pathway, which can provide the single-stranded DNA substrate needed by A3, and contributes to a substantial proportion of A3 mutations genome wide. Because mismatch repair is directed towards early-replicating, gene-rich chromosomal domains, A3 mutagenesis has a high propensity to generate impactful mutations, which exceeds that of other common carcinogens such as tobacco smoke and ultraviolet exposure. Cells direct their DNA repair capacity towards more important genomic regions; thus, carcinogens that subvert DNA repair can be remarkably potent. A new statistical framework to classify mutagenesis clusters identifies a novel, diffuse hypermutation pattern, named omikli, that is induced by APOBEC3 and associated with mismatch-repair activity."
https://openalex.org/W3047037984,"MYCBP2 is a ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligase (E3) that is essential for neurodevelopment and regulates axon maintenance. MYCBP2 transfers Ub to nonlysine substrates via a newly discovered RING-Cys-Relay (RCR) mechanism, where Ub is relayed from an upstream cysteine to a downstream substrate esterification site. The molecular bases for E2-E3 Ub transfer and Ub relay are unknown. Whether these activities are linked to the neural phenotypes is also unclear. We describe the crystal structure of a covalently trapped E2~Ub:MYCBP2 transfer intermediate revealing key structural rearrangements upon E2-E3 Ub transfer and Ub relay. Our data suggest that transfer to the dynamic upstream cysteine, whilst mitigating lysine activity, requires a closed-like E2~Ub conjugate with tempered reactivity, and Ub relay is facilitated by a helix-coil transition. Furthermore, neurodevelopmental defects and delayed injury-induced degeneration in RCR-defective knock-in mice suggest its requirement, and that of substrate esterification activity, for normal neural development and programmed axon degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3046818460,"Background The current study aimed to assess prevalence of mental disorders during Covid-19 pandemic- and respective lockdown in Germany, and potential behaviors/states that can have protective functions on preventing severe mental problems. Assessing prevalence of mental disorders, as well as to find potential protective variables is very important in order to determine people’s psychological suffering. It provides the basis for teaching possible coping styles in order to prevent a major breakdown on mental health. Prevalence on mental disorders was expected to increase during the pandemic, especially depression, (general-/and health-) anxiety, panic attacks- and disorder, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, potentially protective variables, such as resilience and coping, were included. Methods N = 949 subjects completed an online-survey that asked for symptoms regarding depression, (health) anxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and lock-down related behavior—starting 14 days after lockdown in Germany. Results Prevalence of mental disorders in the current sample was much higher than usual prevalence of mental disorders, with 50.6% expressing at least one mental disorder. Resilience was associated with lower risks for any mental disorder (OR = 4.23, p < .0001, 95%CI = 3.21–5.57), as well as with any other measured mental illness (all ORs between = 2.82 for obsessive-compulsive disorder and OR = 41.44 for panic disorder, all p < .001). Similar results were obtained regarding coping (focus on positive). Conclusion Results are highly relevant in order to provide a glance on what substantial influence the current pandemic- and lockdown situation has on mental health across the country, and possibly across the world. Possible ways in order to prevent deterioration and help coping with the current situation are being elaborated and discussed."

No comprehensive profiling of cancer genomes, transcriptomes or epigenomes has been performed in this population thus far. We characterized 118 tumors from Ugandan patients, of whom 72 were HIV+, and performed extended mutation analysis on an additional 89 tumors. We detected human papillomavirus (HPV)-clade-specific differences in tumor DNA methylation, promoter- and enhancer-associated histone marks, gene expression and pathway dysregulation. Changes in histone modification at HPV integration events were correlated with upregulation of nearby genes and endogenous retroviruses. Genomic analysis of 118 cervical tumors from Ugandan individuals identifies HPV-clade-specific differences in tumor DNA methylation, regulatory-region-associated histone marks, gene expression and pathway dysregulation."
https://openalex.org/W3046928981,"Long working hours are known to have a negative effect on health. However, there is no clear evidence for a direct link between mental health and long working hours in the young adult populations. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether long working hours are associated with mental health in young adult workers. Data were collected from a 2012 follow-up survey of the Youth Panel 2007. A total of 3,332 young adult employees (aged 20 to 35) were enrolled in the study. We analyzed stress, depression, and suicidal thoughts by multivariate logistic regression analysis based on working hours (41 to 50, 51 to 60 and over 60 hours, compared to 31 to 40 hours per week), which was adjusted for sex, age, marriage status, region, and educational level. From the 3,332 young adult employees, about 60% of the workers worked more than 40 hours and 17% of the workers worked more than 50 hours per week. In a Chi-square test, stress level, depression, and suicidal thoughts increased with increasing working hours (p-value <0.001, 0.007, and 0.018, respectively). The multivariate logistic regression model showed that, compared to the 31 to 40 hours per week group, the adjusted odds ratios of the 41 to 50, 51 to 60, and over 60 hours per week groups for stress were 1.46(1.23–1.74), 2.25(1.79–2.83) and 2.55(1.72–3.77), respectively. A similar trend was shown in depression [odds ratios: 2.08(1.23–3.53), 2.79(1.44–5.39) and 4.09(1.59–10.55), respectively] and suicidal ideation [odds ratios: 1.98(0.95–4.10), 3.48(1.48–8.19) and 5.30(1.61–17.42), respectively]. We concluded that long working hours were associated with stress, depression, and suicidal ideation in young employees, aged 20 to 35."
https://openalex.org/W3046931356,"Background Maturation of multiple neurobehavioral systems, including autonomic regulation, is altered by preterm birth. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term effects of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) in the NICU on autonomic regulation of preterm infants and their mothers. Method A subset of infants and mothers (48% of infants, 51% of mothers) randomly assigned to either standard are (SC), or SC plus the FNI in the NICU in a prior RCT (ClincalTrials.gov; NCT01439269) returned for follow-up assessments when the children were 4 to 5 years corrected age (CA). ECGs were collected for 10 minutes in mothers and their children while children were in their mothers’ laps. Heart rate, standard deviation for heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)–an index of parasympathetic regulation, and a measure of vagal efficiency were quantified. Results Both children and mothers in the FNI group had significantly greater levels of RSA compared to the SC group (child: mean difference = 0.60, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.03, p = 0.008; mother: mean difference = 0.64, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.21, p = 0.031). In addition, RSA increased more rapidly in FNI children between infancy and the 4 to 5-year follow-up time point (SC = +3.11±0.16 loge msec2, +3.67±0.19 loge msec2 for FNI, p<0.05). These results show that the rate of increase in RSA from infancy to childhood is more rapid in FNI subjects. Conclusion Although these preliminary follow-up results are based on approximately half of subjects originally enrolled in the RCT, they suggest that FNI-NICU led to healthier autonomic regulation in both mother and child, when measured during a brief face-to-face socioemotional interaction. A Pavlovian autonomic co-conditioning mechanism may underly these findings that can be exploited therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W3047544313,"Compensatory changes in energy expenditure occur in response to positive and negative energy balance, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Under low energy demand, the mitochondrial electron transport system is particularly sensitive to added energy supply (i.e. reductive stress), which exponentially increases the rate of H2O2 (JH2O2) production. H2O2 is reduced to H2O by electrons supplied by NADPH. NADP+ is reduced back to NADPH by activation of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT). The coupling of reductive stress-induced JH2O2 production to NNT-linked redox buffering circuits provides a potential means of integrating energy balance with energy expenditure. To test this hypothesis, energy supply was manipulated by varying flux rate through β-oxidation in muscle mitochondria minus/plus pharmacological or genetic inhibition of redox buffering circuits. Here we show during both non-ADP- and low-ADP-stimulated respiration that accelerating flux through β-oxidation generates a corresponding increase in mitochondrial JH2O2 production, that the majority (∼70-80%) of H2O2 produced is reduced to H2O by electrons drawn from redox buffering circuits supplied by NADPH, and that the rate of electron flux through redox buffering circuits is directly linked to changes in oxygen consumption mediated by NNT. These findings provide evidence that redox reactions within β-oxidation and the electron transport system serve as a barometer of substrate flux relative to demand, continuously adjusting JH2O2 production and, in turn, the rate at which energy is expended via NNT-mediated proton conductance. This variable flux through redox circuits provides a potential compensatory mechanism for fine-tuning energy expenditure to energy balance in real time."
https://openalex.org/W3047041100,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women globally. The existing treatment options for breast cancer are largely associated with severe toxicities, and lower efficacies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of non-toxic effective drugs against breast cancer. For this purpose, drug repositioning strategy was used to evaluate the anti-cancer potential of a library of heterocyclic drugs. The major advantage of drug repurposing is that the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles of drugs are well documented. In the current study, we screened 97 drugs of different chemical classes, and among them aripiprazole, an antipsychotic drug, was found to be sufficiently active against breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Aripiprazole showed a cytotoxicity (IC50 = 12.1 ± 0.40 μM) to MCF-7 cells, comparable to the standard anticancer drug doxorubicin (IC50 = 1.25 ± 0.34 μM). Aripiprazole was also found to be active against other cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 19.83 ± 0.27 μM), AU565 (IC50 = 18.02 ± 0.44 μM), and BT-474 (IC50 = 36.42 ± 0.12 μM). Aripiprazole significantly inhibited the cell cycle progression at subG0G1 phase, and enhanced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The drug was also able to significantly increase the nuclear condensation, and modulated the expression of certain genes involved in breast cancer, such as caspases 3, and 9, BAK-1, C-MYC, BCL2L1, BCL-10, and BCL-2. Further studies are needed to explore the effect of aripiprazole on intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3047253285,"Objectives Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with severe autonomic dysfunction. Patients with SCI often suffer from a lack of central nervous system control over the gastrointestinal system. Therefore, we hypothesized that patients with SCI would cause intestinal flora imbalance. We investigated alterations in the fecal microbiome in a group of patients with SCI. Methods Microbial communities in the feces of 23 patients and 23 healthy controls were investigated using high-throughput Illumina Miseq sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The relative abundances between the fecal microbiota at the genus level in patients with SCI and healthy individuals were determined using cluster analysis. Results The structure and quantity of fecal microbiota differed significantly between patients with SCI and healthy controls, but the richness and diversity were not significantly different. A two-dimensional heatmap showed that the relative abundances of forty-five operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were significantly enriched either in SCI or healthy samples. Among these, 18 OTUs were more abundant in healthy controls than in patients with SCI, and 27 OTUs were more abundant in the SCI group than in healthy controls. Conclusion Our study showed that patients with SCI exhibited microbiome dysbiosis."

TARPs generally slow gating kinetics, prolonging receptor activation, and are expressed in distinct, partially overlapping patterns in the brain. The first identified TARP, γ2 (or stargazin), is predominantly expressed in the cerebellum; accordingly, γ2 mouse mutants show severe deficits in motor coordination (23Letts V.A. Felix R.

Sequence analysis and mutagenesis identified a potential binding site for these drugs between TARP γ8 (transmembrane helices M3T and M4T) and the AMPAR (helices M1A and M4A). TARP-selectivity is conferred by two residues unique to γ8, Val-176 in M3T and Gly-209 in M4T (rat sequence) (Fig. 1, B–D), that are replaced in the other type 1 TARPs (γ2–4) by the bulkier isoleucine and alanine (Fig. 1B), which likely block ligand access. These modulators, together with more potent new derivatives (13Savall B.M. Wu D. Swanson D.M. Seierstad M. Wu N. Vives Martinez J. García Olmos B. Lord B. Coe K. Koudriakova T. Lovenberg T.W.

Toward this aim we combined rigid and induced-fit docking with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrophysiology to investigate how these ligands target the AMPAR-γ8 complex. We identify a conserved binding pose shared between three chemically diverse modulators and describe a major functional component contributing to the negative modulation of receptor gating. Our data shed new light on the function of AMPAR-γ8 modulators and will permit structure-based refinement of improved derivatives. The AMPAR-γ8 modulators investigated in this study, LY-3130481, JNJ-55511118, and JNJ-61432059 (herein referred to as LY-481, JNJ-118, and JNJ-059), are depicted in Fig. 2A.

The variable region (Fig. 2A, blue) differs substantially between ligands, and contrary to the oxindole isostere, alteration of this region never causes compound inactivation, suggesting that it is not a critical region for protein interaction (12Gardinier K.M.

Interestingly, chiral activity of LY-481, mediated by the carbon linker between oxindole and variable regions (Fig. 2A1, green), had a substantial impact on binding, with the (S)-enantiomer being two orders of magnitude more potent than the (R)-enantiomer (pIC50 = 7.2 versus 5.1) (12Gardinier K.M. Gernert D.L. Porter W.J. Reel J.K. Ornstein P.L. Spinazze P. Stevens C.C. Hahn P. Hollinshead S.P. Mayhugh D. Schkeryantz J. Khilevich A. De Frutos O. Gleason S.D.

Because radiolabeled LY-481 derivatives can associate with free γ8 in the absence of the AMPAR (36Lee M.R. Gardinier K.M. Gernert D.L. Schober D.A. Wright R.A. Wang H. Qian Y. Witkin J.M. Nisenbaum E.S. Kato A.S. Structural determinants of the γ-8 TARP dependent AMPA receptor antagonist.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2017; 8 (28825787): 2631-264710.1021/acschemneuro.7b00186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the oxindole isostere could directly engage with γ8 to mediate the compounds' effects. We considered the possibility that the oxindole isosteres also exist as enol tautomers (in addition to the published keto isomers), which is apparent from 1H-NMR spectra of related structures in the Spectral Database for Organic Compounds (SDBS). 1H NMR spectra permit the assignment of hydrogen atoms to specific groups, because the spectra are influenced by surrounding atoms within the molecule (37Gottlieb H.E. Kotlyar V. Nudelman A. NMR chemical shifts of common laboratory solvents as trace impurities.J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62 (11671879): 7512-751510.1021/jo971176vCrossref PubMed Scopus (2721) Google Scholar). Whereas the oxindole group of JNJ-059 favors the keto tautomer (SBDS 13584) (Fig. 2B, top row), the benzimidazolone of JNJ-118 could exist in either the keto or the enol form (SBDS 13287; Fig. 2B). Interestingly, for the LY-481 benzothiazolone moiety, the enol form appeared dominant (SBDS 17222). Based on these observations, both tautomers were used for ligand docking. To enable ligand docking, we first generated an all-atom model based on the GluA1/2 TARP γ8 cryo-EM structure (PDB 6QKC) (34Herguedas B. Watson J.F. Ho H. Cais O. García-Nafría J. Greger I.H.

The best model was chosen following two criteria: its discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score (39Shen M.-Y. Sali A.

Based on these criteria, model 8 ranked highest of ten (see Table 1; “Experimental procedures”). The main goal was to select a model that also includes the intra- and extracellular AMPAR loops with a realistic conformation, while preserving the transmembrane sector. Of note, the local resolution of the cryo-EM map in the transmembrane region, including the binding site, was < 4 Å, providing a realistic starting structure (34Herguedas B. Watson J.F. Ho H. Cais O.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish and empirically test a theoretical model to explore how agility and innovativeness in organic food value chain finance are achieved through ITI, TRST, CG, ICT, and IS, and how these, in turn, can accelerate financial flow in the value chain and enhance competitiveness. The present study used a survey method and collected data from small-scale farmers, traders, and financial institutions. The model and hypothesis are tested using data obtained from 331 respondents through partial least square structure equation modeling techniques. We argue that development of theoretical model show potential to increase creditworthiness of smallholders and overcome uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangement. Thus, the present study could provide new ways to integrate the value chain partners, through information and communication technology and governance arrangements in the organic food value chain financing. This study demonstrates that the mediations of innovativeness and agility significantly affect the development of new financial products to make agile the financial flow, which in turn positively influences value chain competitiveness. Significant judgments are required for trustworthy relations among the value chain partners to positively harness innovative product development for swifter value chain finance. Therefore, this theoretical model should not be regarded as a quick solution, but a process of testing, error, and learning by doing so."
https://openalex.org/W3047335366,"Drug resistant Salmonella species and shortcomings related to current drugs stress the urgent need to search for new antimicrobial agents to control salmonellosis. This study investigated the antisalmonellal and antioxidant potentials of methanolic and hydro-ethanolic extracts of Garcinia kola and Alchornea cordifolia as potential sources of drugs to control Salmonella species and to reduce related oxidative stress. The antisalmonellal activity was assessed using the broth microdilution, membrane destabilization and time-kill kinetic assays. While, the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays were used for the determination of the antioxidant activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 125 to 1000 μg/mL, with the methanolic root extract of G. kola being the most active. The time kill kinetic assay revealed a concentration-dependent bacteriostatic activity for promising extracts. Potent extracts from G. kola showed the ability to destabilize S. typhi outer membrane, with the methanolic root extract presenting the highest activity; two-fold higher than those of polymyxin B tested as reference. In addition, this methanolic root extract of G. kola also provoked nucleotide leakage in a concentration-dependent manner. From the antioxidant assays, the hydro-ethanolic extract from the stem bark of A. cordifolia presented significant activities comparable to that of Vitamin C. The methanolic root extract of G. kola also presented appreciable antioxidant activities, though less than that of A. cordifolia. Overall, the phytochemical screening of active extracts revealed the presence of anthocyanins, flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, tannins, triterpenoids and steroids. These results provide evidence of the antibacterial potential of G. kola and offer great perspectives in a possible standardisation of an antisalmonellal phytomedicine."

https://openalex.org/W3047022402,"Alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (ATMACs), dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs) and benzylalkyldimethylethylammonium compounds (BACs) are quaternary alkylammonium compounds (QAAC), which are released into the environment in large quantities after their use in cleaning agents and disinfectants. Despite their potential role as selective agents promoting resistance against QAACs as well as antibiotics, there is a lack of data for QAACs in soil due to the lack of sensitive analytical methods. Therefore, we present a robust and fast method for the extraction and quantification of concentrations of these compounds in soil and sewage sludge. The method is based on ultrasonic extraction (USE) with a mixture of acetonitrile and HCl followed by a solid phase extraction (SPE) cleaning step and a subsequent quantification of concentrations with high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in multi mass reaction mode (MRM). The proposed method is suitable for the quantification of ATMACs (chain length C-8 to C-16), BACs (C-8 to C-18) and DADMACs (C-8 to C-16). The achieved limits of quantification (LOQ) range from 0.1 μg kg-1 to 2.1 μg kg-1. The recovery rates of spiked soil samples for non-deuterated homologues were between 47% and 57%. The analysis of sewage sludge samples and soil samples revealed that BAC-C12 was the most abundant QAAC with concentrations up to 38600 μg kg-1 in sewage sludge and up to 81 μg kg-1 in a Mexican soil that was irrigated with wastewater. Overall, the presented methods open perspectives for effectively studying fate and effects of QAACs in soils."
https://openalex.org/W3047158302,"We propose a process graph (P-graph) approach to develop ecosystem networks from knowledge of the properties of the component species. Originally developed as a process engineering tool for designing industrial plants, the P-graph framework has key advantages over conventional ecological network analysis techniques based on input-output models. A P-graph is a bipartite graph consisting of two types of nodes, which we propose to represent components of an ecosystem. Compartments within ecosystems (e.g., organism species) are represented by one class of nodes, while the roles or functions that they play relative to other compartments are represented by a second class of nodes. This bipartite graph representation enables a powerful, unambiguous representation of relationships among ecosystem compartments, which can come in tangible (e.g., mass flow in predation) or intangible form (e.g., symbiosis). For example, within a P-graph, the distinct roles of bees as pollinators for some plants and as prey for some animals can be explicitly represented, which would not otherwise be possible using conventional ecological network analysis. After a discussion of the mapping of ecosystems into P-graph, we also discuss how this framework can be used to guide understanding of complex networks that exist in nature. Two component algorithms of P-graph, namely maximal structure generation (MSG) and solution structure generation (SSG), are shown to be particularly useful for ecological network analysis. These algorithms enable candidate ecosystem networks to be deduced based on current scientific knowledge on the individual ecosystem components. This method can be used to determine the (a) effects of loss of specific ecosystem compartments due to extinction, (b) potential efficacy of ecosystem reconstruction efforts, and (c) maximum sustainable exploitation of human ecosystem services by humans. We illustrate the use of P-graph for the analysis of ecosystem compartment loss using a small-scale stylized case study, and further propose a new criticality index that can be easily derived from SSG results."
https://openalex.org/W3047238300,"In an era of big data, the availability of satellite-derived global climate, terrain, and land cover imagery presents an opportunity for modeling the suitability of malaria disease vectors at fine spatial resolutions, across temporal scales, and over vast geographic extents. Leveraging cloud-based geospatial analytical tools, we present an environmental suitability model that considers water resources, flow accumulation areas, precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and land cover. In contrast to predictive models generated using spatially and temporally discontinuous mosquito presence information, this model provides continuous fine-spatial resolution information on the biophysical drivers of suitability. For the purposes of this study the model is parameterized for Anopheles gambiae s.s. in Malawi for the rainy (December-March) and dry seasons (April-November) in 2017; however, the model may be repurposed to accommodate different mosquito species, temporal periods, or geographical boundaries. Final products elucidate the drivers and potential habitat of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Rainy season results are presented by quartile of precipitation; Quartile four (Q4) identifies areas most likely to become inundated and shows 7.25% of Malawi exhibits suitable water conditions (water only) for Anopheles gambiae s.s., approximately 16% for water plus another factor, and 8.60% is maximally suitable, meeting suitability thresholds for water presence, terrain characteristics, and climatic conditions. Nearly 21% of Malawi is suitable for breeding based on land characteristics alone and 28.24% is suitable according to climate and land characteristics. Only 6.14% of the total land area is suboptimal. Dry season results show 25.07% of the total land area is suboptimal or unsuitable. Approximately 42% of Malawi is suitable based on land characteristics alone during the dry season, and 13.11% is suitable based on land plus another factor. Less than 2% meets suitability criteria for climate, water, and land criteria. Findings illustrate environmental drivers of suitability for malaria vectors, providing an opportunity for a more comprehensive approach to malaria control that includes not only modeled species distributions, but also the underlying drivers of suitability for a more effective approach to environmental management."
https://openalex.org/W3047337142,"Anatomically terminal parts of the urinary, reproductive, and digestive systems of birds all connect to the cloaca. As the feces drain through the cloaca in chickens, the cloacal bacteria were previously believed to represent those of the digestive system. To investigate similarities between the cloacal microbiota and the microbiota of the digestive and reproductive systems, microbiota inhabiting the colon, cloaca, and magnum, which is a portion of the chicken oviduct of 34-week-old, specific-pathogen-free hens were analyzed using a 16S rRNA metagenomic approach using the Ion torrent sequencer and the Qiime2 bioinformatics platform. Beta diversity via unweighted and weighted unifrac analyses revealed that the cloacal microbiota was significantly different from those in the colon and the magnum. Unweighted unifrac revealed that the cloacal microbiota was distal from the microbiota in the colon than from the microbiota in the magnum, whereas weighted unifrac revealed that the cloacal microbiota was located further away from the microbiota in the magnum than from the microbiota inhabiting the colon. Pseudomonas spp. were the most abundant in the cloaca, whereas Lactobacillus spp. and Flavobacterium spp. were the most abundant species in the colon and the magnum. The present results indicate that the cloaca contains a mixed population of bacteria, derived from the reproductive, urinary, and digestive systems, particularly in egg-laying hens. Therefore, sampling cloaca to study bacterial populations that inhabit the digestive system of chickens requires caution especially when applied to egg-laying hens. To further understand the physiological role of the microbiota in chicken cloaca, exploratory studies of the chicken's cloacal microbiota should be performed using chickens of different ages and types."
https://openalex.org/W3047510469,"The aim of this study was to clarify the heights and spatial relationships of the facial muscles acting on the nasolabial fold (NLF) by dissection and three-dimensional microcomputed tomography for use in aesthetic treatments. This study used 56 specimens from 34 embalmed adult Korean. A reference line (RF) was set to imitate the NLF after removing the skin, from the superior point of the alar facial crease to the lateral point of the orbicularis oris muscle at the level of the corner of the mouth. The heights and spatial relationships of the facial muscles along the RF could be categorized into five main patterns. The dominant pattern was that the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle (LLSAN), levator labii superioris muscle (LLS), zygomaticus minor muscle (Zmi), and zygomaticus major muscle (Zmj) were on the medial third, medial half, middle third, and lateral third of the RF, respectively. In micro-CT imaging, beneath the skin of the medial half of the NLF, the LLSAN and Zmi fibers inserted into the dermis of the NLF and adjacent to the NLF. Beneath the skin of the middle third of the NLF, the Zmi fibers were found before the muscle inserted into the dermis of the NLF and adjacent to the NLF. Beneath the skin of the lateral third of the NLF, the lateral margin of the orbicularis oris muscle and some Zmj fibers were found at the location of the NLF. The present study utilized dissections and micro-CT to reveal the general pattern and variations of heights and spatial relationships of the facial muscles passing beneath the NLF. These findings will be useful for understanding which muscles affect specific parts of NLFs with various contours, for reducing the NLF in aesthetic treatments, and for reconstructing the NLF in cases of facial paralysis."
https://openalex.org/W3046933341,"Background Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) is a very serious form of tuberculosis that is burdened with a heavy mortality toll, especially before the advent of new TB drugs. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is among the countries most affected by this new epidemic. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of the records of all patients with pre- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis hospitalized from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 and monitored for at least 6 months to one year after the end of their treatment in Kinshasa; an individualized therapeutic regimen with bedaquiline for 20 months was built for each patient. The adverse effects were systematically monitored. Results Of the 40 laboratory-confirmed patients, 32 (80%) patients started treatment, including 29 preXRB and 3 XDR TB patients. In the eligible group, 3 patients (9.4%) had HIV-TB coinfections. The therapeutic success rate was 53.2%, and the mortality rate was 46.8% (15/32); there were no relapses, failures or losses to follow-up. All coinfected HIV–TB patients died during treatment. The cumulative patient survival rate was 62.5% at 3 months, 53.1% at 6 months and 53.1% at 20 months. The most common adverse events were vomiting, Skin rash, anemia and peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion The new anti-tuberculosis drugs are a real hope for the management of Drug Resistant tuberculosis patient and other new therapeutic combinations may improve favorable outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3047264471,"The integrity of the genetic material is crucial for every organism. One intrinsic attack to genome stability is stalling of the replication fork which can result in DNA breakage. Several factors, such as DNA lesions or the formation of stable secondary structures (eg, G-quadruplexes) can lead to replication fork stalling. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are well-characterized stable secondary DNA structures that can form within specific single-stranded DNA sequence motifs and have been shown to block/pause the replication machinery. In most genomes several helicases have been described to regulate G4 unfolding to preserve genome integrity, however, different experiments raise the hypothesis that processing of G4s during DNA replication is more complex and requires additional, so far unknown, proteins. Here, we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mgs1 protein robustly binds to G4 structures in vitro and preferentially acts at regions with a strong potential to form G4 structures in vivo. Our results suggest that Mgs1 binds to G4-forming sites and has a role in the maintenance of genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W3047536358,"Across taxa, sex-specific demands vary temporally in accordance with reproductive investments. In solitary carnivores, females must provision and protect young independently while meeting increased energetic demands. Males seek to monopolize access to females by maintaining large territories and defending them from other males. For many species, it is poorly understood how these demands relate to broad-scale animal movements. To investigate predictions surrounding the reproductive strategies of solitary carnivores and effects of local conditions on bobcat (Lynx rufus) spatial ecology, we examined the effects of sex and reproductive season on home range size, movement rate, and resource selection of bobcats in the central Appalachian Mountains. Male seasonal home ranges were approximately 3 times larger than those of females (33.9 ± 2.6 vs. 12.1 ± 2.4 km2, x±SE), and male movement rates were 1.4 times greater than females (212.6 ± 3.6 vs. 155 ± 8.2 m/hr), likely reflecting male efforts to maximize access to females. Both sexes appear to maintain relatively stable seasonal home ranges despite temporally varying reproductive investments, instead adjusting movements within home ranges. Males increased movements during the dispersal period, potentially reflecting increased territoriality prior to breeding. Females increased movements during the kitten-rearing period, when foraging more intensively, and frequently returning to den sites. Both sexes selected home ranges at higher elevations. However, females selected deciduous forest and avoided fields, whereas males selected fields and avoided deciduous forest, perhaps explained by male pressure to access multiple females across several mountain ridges and higher risk tolerance. Seasonal changes in home range selection likely reflect changes in home range shape. Increased female avoidance of fields during kitten rearing may indicate female avoidance of presumably resource rich, yet risky, fields at the time when kittens are most vulnerable. Our results indicate that while reproductive chronology influences the spatial ecology of solitary carnivores, effects may be constrained by territoriality."
https://openalex.org/W3047269537,"Inhibitors against the NS3-4A protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV) have proven to be useful drugs in the treatment of HCV infection. Although variants have been identified with mutations that confer resistance to these inhibitors, the mutations do not restore replicative fitness and no secondary mutations that rescue fitness have been found. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the lack of fitness compensation, we screened known resistance mutations in infectious HCV cell culture with different genomic backgrounds. We observed that the Q41R mutation of NS3-4A efficiently rescues the replicative fitness in cell culture for virus variants containing mutations at NS3-Asp168. To understand how the Q41R mutation rescues activity, we performed protease activity assays complemented by molecular dynamics simulations, which showed that protease-peptide interactions far outside the targeted peptide cleavage sites mediate substrate recognition by NS3-4A and support protease cleavage kinetics. These interactions shed new light on the mechanisms by which NS3-4A cleaves its substrates, viral polyproteins and a prime cellular antiviral adaptor protein, the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS. Peptide binding is mediated by an extended hydrogen-bond network in NS3-4A that was effectively optimized for protease-MAVS binding in Asp168 variants with rescued replicative fitness from NS3-Q41R. In the protease harboring NS3-Q41R, the N-terminal cleavage products of MAVS retained high affinity to the active site, rendering the protease susceptible for potential product inhibition.

The finding that NS3-Q41R, which itself is reported to confer resistance to macrocyclic PIs (19Jiang M. Mani N. Lin C. Ardzinski A. Nelson M. Reagan D. Bartels D. Zhou Y. Nicolas O. Rao B.G. Müh U.

Our findings highlight a previously unknown molecular mechanism for MAVS that potentially restricts virus evolution under PI pressure, providing a new paradigm for variant selection from HCV-infected cells. We aimed to identify PI resistance–associated amino acid substitutions in NS3-4A that lead to high replicative fitness and potentially confer a general drug resistance phenotype to the virus (1Sheldon J.

Resistance mutations were identified by a review of published data from both cell culture–based and clinical studies of PIs (7Shimakami T. Welsch C. Yamane D. McGivern D.R. Yi M. Zeuzem S. Lemon S.M. Protease inhibitor-resistant hepatitis C virus mutants with reduced fitness from impaired production of infectious virus.Gastroenterology. 2011; 140 (21056040): 667-67510.1053/j.gastro.2010.10.056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To characterize the impact of PI-resistance mutations on RNA replication, we constructed two comprehensive panels, each with 23 resistance mutations in derivatives of pH77S (21Yi M. Villanueva R.A. Thomas D.L. Wakita T. Lemon S.M. Production of infectious genotype 1a hepatitis C virus (Hutchinson strain) in cultured human hepatoma cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The two panels only differed by the cell culture adaptive mutation Q41R in their NS3-4A protease backbone (7Shimakami T. Welsch C. Yamane D. McGivern D.R. Yi M. Zeuzem S. Lemon S.M. Protease inhibitor-resistant hepatitis C virus mutants with reduced fitness from impaired production of infectious virus.Gastroenterology. 2011; 140 (21056040): 667-67510.1053/j.gastro.2010.10.056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We measured Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) activity from NS3-Gln41/GLuc2A RNA and NS3-Q41R/GLuc2A RNA in media collected at 24-h intervals after transfection. NS3-Q41R showed no loss of replication capacity compared with NS3-Gln41, although the replication capacity of mutants in both backbones, in general, was more compromised in NS3-Q41R (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, NS3-Q41R served to promote the replication of the NS3–Asp168 variants Ala/Glu/His/Val despite acting synergistically to impair the replication of other key PI-resistant variants, such as R155K. Compared with WT, the GLuc activity of D168A was compensated to ∼91% by NS3-Q41R (161% increase compared with NS3-Gln41; fold change (FC) 2.6) and that in D168E was boosted to ∼141% by NS3-Q41R (44% increase compared with NS3-Gln41; FC 1.4). For the clinically relevant D168A/E mutants with increased replicative fitness by NS3-Q41R, we further measured the ability to produce infectious viruses in NS3-Gln41 and NS3-Q41R protease backbones using a sensitive GLuc assay (Fig. 2). Both mutants produced more infectious viruses in the NS3-Q41R backbone than in NS3-Gln41, which corresponded with the respective results on their RNA replication capacity (Fig. 2). Asp168 mutants are signature mutations selected from pressure with macrocyclic PIs such as simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir and glecaprevir (17Poordad F. Hezode C. Trinh R. Kowdley K.V.

To assess the ability of a macrocyclic PI to inhibit the RNA replication of PI-resistant variants in NS3-Gln41 and NS3-Q41R protease backbones, antiviral EC50 values were determined from the concentration of simeprevir required to cause a 50% reduction in the secretion of GLuc by RNA-transfected cells. The NS3-Q41R backbone caused an increase in EC50 for most PI-resistance mutations tested with on-average-higher–level PI resistance than the respective mutants in an NS3-Gln41 genomic background. All Asp168 mutants tested in the NS3-Q41R backbone showed high-level PI resistance against simeprevir (FC 32–156 compared with the WT protease NS3-Gln41); see Table 1 and Fig. S1 for details on the replicative fitness and drug resistance.Figure 2Impact of NS3 ± Q41R on the infectious virus production of Asp168 variants.

For further in vitro characterization, we selected the clinically most relevant PI-resistance–associated mutations D168A and D168E that showed rescued replicative fitness due to NS3-Q41R, but omitted D168H (clinically less important) and D168V (only weak fitness compensation). D168T was selected from the Asp168 mutants as a negative control without impact on replicative fitness in protease backbones ± Q41R. To characterize the fitness-compensatory mechanism of NS3-Q41R in Asp168 variants, we expressed and purified the NS3-4A WT fusion and different mutant forms (see “Experimental procedures” and Fig. S2). We first tested if D168A/E/T ± NS3-Q41R had an effect on the protease stability (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The impact of mutants on protein-folding was determined by a thermal shift assay, where protein denaturation at increasing temperatures was revealed by increased fluorescence (see “Experimental procedures”). The NS3-Gln41 protease WT was stable to temperature with a melting temperature, Tm, at 54.9 °C (Fig. 3). NS3-Q41R had no effect on the protein stability. A significant difference in protein stability was observed between D168E and D168A/T mutant proteases irrespective of the NS3-4A protease background ± Q41R (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3). As we showed previously (18Welsch C. Haselow K. Gouttenoire J. Schneider M. Morikawa K. Martinez Y. Susser S. Sarrazin C. Zeuzem S. Antes I. Moradpour D. Lange C.M. Hepatitis C virus variants resistant to macrocyclic NS3-4A inhibitors subvert IFN-β induction by efficient MAVS cleavage.J.

In contrast to D168A, the D168E mutant can compensate the missing interactions of the Asp168 residue with Arg155 and Arg123 and stabilize the protein fold (18Welsch C. Haselow K. Gouttenoire J. Schneider M. Morikawa K. Martinez Y. Susser S. Sarrazin C. Zeuzem S. Antes I. Moradpour D. Lange C.M.

Our present study confirms the modeling results published earlier (18Welsch C. Haselow K. Gouttenoire J. Schneider M. Morikawa K. Martinez Y. Susser S. Sarrazin C. Zeuzem S. Antes I. Moradpour D.

The melting temperatures reflect a stable protease fold in D168E versus destabilization in D168A (Fig. 3). Importantly, NS3-Q41R showed no difference to the NS3-Gln41 WT background either as a single mutant or as a second-site mutation with D168A/E/T (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Thus, we considered it unlikely that the increased replicative fitness in the NS3-Q41R background in D168A/E could be due to a modulation of protein stability in the NS3-4A protease.Table 2Enzyme kinetic constants and protein melting temperatures for NS3-4A protease variantsSubstrateVariantEnzyme kineticsVariantMelting temperature Tm (°C)Km (μm)kcat (/s)kcat/Km (1/(s*µm))NS4A/4BWT (Q41)3.11 ± 0.290.19 ± 0.0110.062 ± 0.008WT (Q41)54.9 ± 0.3Q41R2.11 ± 0.140.18 ± 0.0060.085 ± 0.008Q41R55.1 ± 0.3D168A2.45 ± 0.230.09 ± 0.0040.035 ± 0.004D168A48.7 ± 0.1Q41R-D168A1.71 ± 0.230.15 ± 0.0090.087 ± 0.015Q41R-D168A48.3 ± 0.2D168E1.79 ± 0.110.12 ± 0.0030.067 ± 0.005D168E55.9 ± 0.2Q41R-D168E1.83 ± 0.100.14 ± 0.0010.074 ± 0.005Q41R-D168E55.8 ± 0.3D168T2.03 ± 0.150.13 ± 0.0050.064 ± 0.006D168T47.1 ± 0.1Q41R-D168T1.69 ± 0.140.12 ± 0.0040.071 ± 0.007Q41R-D168T48.5 ± 0.2MAVSWT (Q41)7.82 ± 0.700.058 ± 0.0020.008 ± 0.001Q41R37.32 ± 4.420.275 ± 0.0210.007 ± 0.001D168A14.41 ± 2.910.029 ± 0.0030.002 ± 0.000Q41R-D168A1.77 ± 0.140.507 ± 0.0110.287 ± 0.024 Open table in a new tab Next, we analyzed the protease enzymatic activity using an in vitro FRET-based assay that measures the cleavage of a viral polyprotein substrate. We tested the kinetic properties of NS3-Gln41 WT and D168A/E/T ± NS3-Q41R mutants using a peptide substrate derived from the viral NS4A/4B polyprotein cleavage site (Fig. 4A and Table 2) comprising an excited donor molecule and a quencher (see “Experimental procedures”). In this assay, fluorescence is released when the protease recognizes and cleaves the FRET substrate. We determined the amount of substrate needed to obtain half of the protease maximum rate of reaction (Km) and substrate turnover rates (kcat). The protease with the NS3-Q41R backbone exhibited a lower Km than the NS3-Gln41 WT (p = 0.08; FC 0.5). No difference was found in the substrate turnover kcat between the two genomic backgrounds. The D168A mutant in NS3-Gln41 showed a significantly lower kcat (p = 0.0008; FC 1.1) and a slight decrease in Km (p = 0.24; FC 0.3) compared with Asp168-WT. A further decrease in Km (p = 0.13; FC 0.8) paralleled by a significant increase in kcat (p = 0.003; FC 0.7) for D168A was found in the NS3-Q41R backbone. Whereas differences in Km were not significant for D168E ± NS3-Q41R, kcat was significantly higher for D168E in the NS3-Q41R versus NS3-Gln41 backbone (p = 0.01; FC 0.2) (Fig. 4A). No such effect was observed for D168T ± NS3-Q41R (Fig. 4A), which was tested as a Asp168 variant not compensated for replicative fitness deficits by NS3-Q41R (Fig. 1C). Although Km and kcat varied in rather narrow ranges between 1.7 and 3.1 µm and 0.09 and 0.19, respectively, the kinetic constants reflect the fitness-compensatory effect of NS3-Q41R for D168A/E variants that we observed in infectious cell culture (Fig. 1C). Notably, NS3-Q41R is not observed as a fitness-compensatory mutation in PI-failure patients with Asp168 variants (23Welzel T.M. Bhardwaj N. Hedskog C. Chodavarapu K. Camus G. McNally J. Brainard D.

As we showed previously, efficient MAVS cleavage is a characteristic feature of Asp168 variants and a key escape mechanism under selective pressure with macrocyclic PIs (18Welsch C. Haselow K. Gouttenoire J. Schneider M. Morikawa K. Martinez Y. Susser S. Sarrazin C. Zeuzem S. Antes I. Moradpour D. Lange C.M. Hepatitis C virus variants resistant to macrocyclic NS3-4A inhibitors subvert IFN-β induction by efficient MAVS cleavage.J.

Hence, we reasoned that NS3-Q41R could have varied the kinetic properties of D168A variants toward MAVS. To characterize the effect of D168A and NS3-Q41R on the protease-MAVS cleavage kinetics, we designed a novel FRET peptide incorporating the MAVS cleavage site. As done for NS4A/4B, Km and kcat of D168A ± NS3-Q41R were determined for the MAVS peptide (Fig. 4B). In contrast to NS4A/4B, we observed vast variations in the kinetic constants for MAVS. Compared with the NS3-Gln41 protease WT, NS3-Q41R showed an ∼5-fold increase in kcat (p = 0.008; FC 4.7), although the Km was significantly higher than in the WT (p = 0.02; FC 4.8). A highly significant and fundamental change with inverse kinetic constants was observed when NS3-Q41R was present as a second-site mutation in the D168A protease (Fig. 4B). Here, D168A showed a more than 16-fold increase in kcat compared with D168A without NS3-Q41R (p = 0.0003; FC 16.5). In parallel, the Km was significantly decreased (p < 0.05; FC 7.1) (Fig. 4B). Thus, there was large reversal in Km and kcat for D168A upon the addition of NS3-Q41R. Next, we calculated the ratio kcat/Km, the specificity constant, to compare the relative rates of NS3-4A protease cleavage on the competing substrates NS4A/4B and MAVS (Table 2). We found that the specificity constant of the D168A-protease for MAVS increased more than 100-fold when harboring NS3-Q41R and 3.3-fold higher than for NS4A/4B. The above results using peptide substrates in vitro suggested a fitness advantage due to NS3-Q41R in Asp168 variants via increased MAVS cleavage capacity. To test this hypothesis in cells, we prepared expressed constructs for Asp168-WT and D168A/E/T mutants in protease genomic backgrounds ± NS3-Q41R. The expressed constructs were transfected into human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cell line U-2 OS cells that express high levels of endogenous MAVS (18Welsch C. Haselow K. Gouttenoire J.

In the present study, we investigated the role of PGRN in regulating chondrocyte homeostasis and its therapeutic potential for managing osteoarthritis (OA). We found that PGRN levels are significantly increased in human cartilage in mild OA and that its expression is decreased in the cartilage in severe OA. In vitro, treatment of primary rat chondrocytes with recombinant PGRN significantly enhanced the levels of collagen type II α 1 chain (COL2A1) and aggrecan, and attenuated TNFα-induced up-regulation of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in chondrocytes. These effects were abrogated in SIRT1−/− cells, indicating a causative role of SIRT1 in the effects of PGRN on protein expression in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, PGRN increased SIRT1 expression and activity, which reduced the acetylation levels of SRY-box transcription factor (SOX9) and transcription factor P65 (P65) and thereby promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 and inhibited TNFα-induced P65 nuclear accumulation to maintain chondrocyte homeostasis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism of action for PGRN that maintains cartilage homeostasis and supports the notion that PGRN up-regulation may be a promising strategy for managing OA.

Interestingly, several previous studies indicated that PGRN could act as a cartilage growth factor and exert a crucial role in cartilage homeostasis. For instance, PGRN-deficient mice showed more severe degeneration of articular cartilage compared with control mice, whereas intra-articular injection of recombinant PGRN dramatically improved OA score and attenuated cartilage matrix loss in surgically induced OA mice (10Zhao Y.P.

Consistently, it is reported that PGRN could inhibit the degradative processes that occur in OA and RA patients by disrupting the interaction between cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and ADAMTS7/ADAMTS12 (11Guo F.

Additionally, several clinical investigations indicated that both serum and protein levels of PGRN were significantly higher in patients with OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (12Yamamoto Y.

Collectively, these observations support an important regulatory role for PGRN in cartilage homeostasis. Although the regulatory role of PGRN in cartilage homeostasis has been identified, the intracellular events responsible for PGRN-mediated protective role against OA progression needed to be elucidated in more detail. It is reported that sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, exerts protective roles in human chondrocytes through enhancing the expression of cartilage anabolic markers such as collagen type II α 1 chain (COL2A1) (15Dvir-Ginzberg M.

Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 in human chondrocytes leads to OA-like gene expression changes (18Fujita N. Matsushita T. Ishida K. Kubo S. Matsumoto T. Takayama K. Kurosaka M. Kuroda R. Potential involvement of SIRT1 in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis through the modulation of chondrocyte gene expressions.J. Orthop.

Disruption of Sirt1 in chondrocytes causes accelerated progression of osteoarthritis under mechanical stress and during ageing in mice.Ann. Rheum.

We recently showed that SIRT1 facilitates growth plate chondrogenesis via deacetylating PERK and attenuating the PERK-eIF-2α-CHOP axis of the unfolded protein response pathway (20Kang X. Yang W. Wang R. Xie T. Li H. Feng D. Jin X. Sun H. Wu S. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) stimulates growth-plate chondrogenesis by attenuating the PERK-eIF-2α-CHOP pathway in the unfolded protein response.J. Biol.

Of note, treatment with PGRN in podocytes has been shown to increase SIRT1 expression and activity, resulting in decreased level in acetylation of PGC-1α and FoxO1 (21Zhou D. Zhou M. Wang Z. Fu Y. Jia M. Wang X. Liu M. Zhang Y. Sun Y. Lu Y. Tang W. Yi F. PGRN acts as a novel regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis by facilitating mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis to prevent podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy.Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10 (31285425): 52410.1038/s41419-019-1754-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, whether and how PGRN modulates SIRT1 expression and activity in the articular chondrocytes have not been elucidated yet. Based on all these findings, we hypothesized that PGRN facilitates cartilage homeostasis by up-regulating SIRT1 expression and activity. In the current study, PGRN promoted SIRT1 expression and activity and then initiated a cascade of target genes involved in anabolism and catabolism of chondrocytes, which clearly demonstrated the relationship between PGRN and SIRT1 in chondrocytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that induction of SIRT1 expression and activity in articular chondrocytes is critical in PGRN-mediated cartilage homeostasis. To gain insight into the role of PGRN during OA development, we obtained normal cartilage of the femoral head from patients with femoral neck fracture without joint disease, the lateral femoral condyle with mild OA, and the medial femoral condyle with severe OA. Safranin-O staining of cartilage was weaker in the cartilage of lateral femoral condyle (mild OA group) than in the normal group, and the cartilage of medial femoral condyle (severe OA group) was barely stained with safranin-O and was severely degenerated (Fig. 1a). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that PGRN levels were increased in human cartilage in mild OA, with PGRN-positive cells mainly observed in the superficial zone, while its expression was decreased in severe OA (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the levels of PGRN in human articular cartilage were further confirmed by Western blotting and real-time PCR (Fig. 1, c and d). Similarly, the expression of PGRN receptor EphA2 was increased in mild OA cartilage but decreased in severe OA cartilage (Fig. S1a). Because PGRN is known as a growth factor that promotes cell cycle progression in many cellular systems (22He Z. Bateman A. Progranulin (granulin-epithelin precursor, PC-cell-derived growth factor, acrogranin) mediates tissue repair and tumorigenesis.J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81 (12928786): 600-61210.1007/s00109-003-0474-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether PGRN affects cartilage-specific gene expression in cultured chondrocytes. Therefore, we tested the expression of cartilage genes markers, including COL2A1 and aggrecan, in chondrocytes isolated from rat articular cartilage in the presence of recombinant PGRN (0–200 ng/ml). As expected, graded concentrations of PGRN stimulated COL2A1 and aggrecan expression and secretion in a dose-dependent manner, with the lowest stimulated concentration of 100 ng/ml (Fig. 2, a–e and Fig. S2a). In addition, 50 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml recombinant PGRN increased the level of PGRN receptor EphA2 in chondrocytes (Fig. S1b). It is well accepted that overexpression or activation of SIRT1 promoted cartilage gene expression in human chondrocytes (15Dvir-Ginzberg M. Gagarina V. Lee E.J. Hall D.J. Regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression in human chondrocytes by SirT1 and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.J. Biol.

Zhou M. Wang Z. Fu Y. Jia M. Wang X. Liu M. Zhang Y. Sun Y. Lu Y. Tang W. Yi F. PGRN acts as a novel regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis by facilitating mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis to prevent podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy.Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10 (31285425): 52410.1038/s41419-019-1754-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), led us to explore whether SIRT1 was involved in PGRN-mediated anabolism of chondrocytes. PGRN enhanced SIRT1 expression and activity in a dose-dependent manner, with higher concentrations (100 and 200 ng/ml) causing a statistically significant up-regulation (Fig. 2, f–h and Fig. S2b). Interestingly, inhibition of SIRT1 by SIRT1 siRNA (the efficiency was validated by real-time PCR and Western blotting) (Fig. 2, i and j and Fig. S2c) dramatically repressed PGRN-mediated up-regulation of cartilage genes (Fig. 2, k–o and Fig. S2d), indicating that PGRN may promote COL2A1 and aggrecan expression and secretion via up-regulation of SIRT1. Because several studies reported that SIRT1 promotes cartilage-specific gene expression through deacetylation of SOX9 (15Dvir-Ginzberg M. Gagarina V. Lee E.J. Hall D.J. Regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression in human chondrocytes by SirT1 and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.J. Biol.

Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that PGRN could significantly reduce the acetylation level of SOX9 (Fig. 3a), whereas such effect was abrogated in SIRT1−/− chondrocytes (Fig. 3b). Given that SOX9 acetylation state may affect SOX9 nuclear entry (16Bar Oz M. Kumar A. Elayyan J. Reich E. Binyamin M. Kandel L. Liebergall M. Steinmeyer J. Lefebvre V. Dvir-Ginzberg M. Acetylation reduces SOX9 nuclear entry and ACAN gene transactivation in human chondrocytes.Aging Cell. 2016; 15 (26910618): 499-50810.1111/acel.12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we postulated that PGRN increased SIRT1 expression and activity to reduce the acetylation level of SOX9 and thereby promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9. As expected, PGRN significantly increased nuclear localization of SOX9, whereas co-treatment with SIRT1 siRNA reversed such stimulatory effect of PGRN (Fig. 3, c and d). To confirm whether PGRN affects catabolism of chondrocytes, we examined the effect of PGRN on expression of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5). However, graded concentration of PGRN (0–200 ng/ml) had a minor effect on the expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS5 both at protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 4, a and b and Fig. S3a). To explore the role of PGRN in cellular models of OA, chondrocytes were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 24 h. However, no changes were observed in either PGRN expression or secretion upon stimulation of TNFα as detected by real-time PCR and ELISA (Fig. 4, c and d). In addition, TNFα inhibited the activity of SIRT1, whereas a combination of PGRN with TNFα partially abrogated this inhibition (Fig. 4e). The stimulation with TNFα significantly induced MMP13 and ADAMTS5 expression, while the addition of PGRN abolished the chondrocyte catabolism induced by TNFα (Fig. 4, f and g and Fig. S3b). Considering the protective role of SIRT1 against OA-related catabolic stimuli in cultured chondrocytes (23Matsushita T. Sasaki H. Takayama K. Ishida K. Matsumoto T. Kubo S. Matsuzaki T. Nishida K. Kurosaka M. Kuroda R. The overexpression of SIRT1 inhibited osteoarthritic gene expression changes induced by interleukin-1β in human chondrocytes.J. Orthop. Res. 2013; 31 (23143889): 531-53710.1002/jor.22268Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we reasoned that PGRN may suppress TNFα-induced chondrocyte catabolism through up-regulation of SIRT1. Indeed, under the stimulation with TNFα, PGRN significantly inhibited MMP13 and ADAMTS5 expression, whereas this suppression was largely nullified in SIRT1−/− chondrocytes (Fig. 4, h and i and Fig. S3c). It is well accepted that TNFα can induce NF-κB–P65 activation and up-regulate the levels of various MMPs and ADAMTS (24Kapoor M. Martel-Pelletier J. Lajeunesse D. Pelletier J.P. Fahmi H. Role of proinflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2011; 7 (21119608): 33-4210.1038/nrrheum.2010.196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) in chondrocytes. Therefore, to explore the downstream mechanism that regulates chondrocytes catabolism, we assessed the acetylation level P65 at Lys-310 in cultured chondrocytes with or without SIRT1 siRNA. TNFα increased both the total P65 and acetylated P65 expression in chondrocytes (Fig. 5a). PGRN reduced the TNFα-induced acetylation level of P65, whereas a combination of PGRN with SIRT1 siRNA abolished this inhibition induced by PGRN (Fig. 5a). Simultaneously, PGRN inhibited TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of P65, whereas such effect was largely lost in SIRT1−/− chondrocytes (Fig. 5, b–d). The previous study reported that SIRT1 inhibited MMP13 expression by reducing LEF1 transcriptional activity, and LEF-1 was known to bind to the MMP13 promoter and transactivate its expression (25Elayyan J. Lee E.J. Gabay O. Smith C.A. Qiq O. Reich E. Mobasheri A. Henrotin Y. Kimber S.J. Dvir-Ginzberg M. LEF1-mediated MMP13 gene expression is repressed by SIRT1 in human chondrocytes.FASEB J. 2017; 31 (28389425): 3116-312510.1096/fj.201601253RCrossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Then, we determined whether the SIRT1/P65 axis was involved in the regulatory sequences of ADAMTS5 promoter by ChIP assay. As shown in Fig. 5e, PGRN inhibited TNFα-induced enrichment of P65 on ADAMTS5 promoter, with these inhibitions being neutralized by co-treatment with SIRT1 siRNA, indicating that PGRN may regulate the transcriptional activity of ADAMTS5 through SIRT1/P65 axis. Collectively, our data indicated that PGRN could inhibit chondrocytes catabolism induced by TNFα by deacetylation and suppressing P65 nuclear accumulation via enhancing the level of SIRT1. To determine the effect of endogenous PGRN, we used siRNA for PGRN in cultured chondrocytes, and its validation was measured by the reduction of PGRN protein and mRNA expression by Western blotting and real-time PCR (Fig. 6, a and b and Fig. S4a). Meanwhile, PGRN siRNA also resulted in a considerable decrease in PGRN secretion in the culture medium (Fig. 6c). Knockdown of PGRN inhibited the anabolism of chondrocytes as evidenced by a decrease in COL2A1 and aggrecan expression and secretion (Fig. 6, d–g), whereas it did not affect levels of catabolic markers, including MMP13 and ADAMTS5 (Fig. 6h and Fig. S4b). PGRN has been purified and identified as a growth factor from conditioned tissue culture media by several independent laboratories (26Zhou J. Gao G. Crabb J.W. Serrero G.

Additionally, PGRN is expressed in both growth plate chondrocytes and articular cartilage chondrocytes, and its level is significantly increased during the entire cartilage development, whereas cartilage-specific ablation of PGRN showed a sharp reduction in skeletal length (29Feng J.Q. Guo F.J. Jiang B.C. Zhang Y. Frenkel S. Wang D.W. Tang W. Xie Y. Liu C.J. Granulin epithelin precursor: A bone morphogenic protein 2-inducible growth factor that activates Erk1/2 signaling and JunB transcription factor in chondrogenesis.FASEB J. 2010; 24 (20124436): 1879-189210.1096/fj.09-144659Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our study also showed that recombinant PGRN significantly enhanced the levels of COL2A1 and aggrecan, whereas down-regulation of endogenous PGRN inhibited COL2A1 and aggrecan expression and secretion. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that PGRN functions effectively in an autocrine manner in chondrocytes. Because PGRN is an autocrine growth factor, we first determined the level of endogenous PGRN in OA cartilage samples. We found the expression of PGRN was increased in the cartilage of lateral femoral condyles with mild OA, whereas its level was decreased in the cartilage of medial femoral condyles with severe OA. Although PGRN may increase as an adaptive response to protect chondrocytes against various stresses during the initial degenerative phase, it may be that elevated PGRN levels are not sufficient to completely neutralize the loss of articular cartilage, and failure to adapt may lead to decreased PGRN level and further progression of cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the level of PGRN tended to be more increased in the superficial zone of the cartilage, where chondrocytes may undergo more stresses compared with the deep zone. We also observed that PGRN receptor EphA2 was decreased in severe OA cartilage, which may be the other reason why endogenous PGRN produced in OA could not ameliorate cartilage degradation. Other endogenous autocrine factors in addition to PGRN have also exerted crucial roles within cartilage tissue. For instance, most bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, play a protective role during OA development (30Deng Z.H. Li Y.S. Gao X. Lei G.H. Huard J. Bone morphogenetic proteins for articular cartilage regeneration.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2018; 26 (29580979): 1153-116110.1016/j.joca.2018.03.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Among the fibroblast growth factors family, FGF1, FGF2, and FGF8 may act as negative regulators of chondrocyte homeostasis, whereas FGF9 and FGF18 protect articular cartilage from degradation during OA progression (31Chen T.M. Chen Y.H. Sun H.S. Tsai S.J. Fibroblast growth factors: Potential novel targets for regenerative therapy of osteoarthritis.Chin. J. Physiol. 2019; 62 (30942193): 2-1010.4103/CJP.CJP_11_19Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As with most anabolic growth factors, including BMPs and IGF-1, PGRN promotes chondrocytes proliferation and hypertrophy during the growth plate chondrogenesis, an essential process for both the long bone growth and bone fracture healing. Although BMP2 was the first trial in bone fracture healing given its promoting effect on new bone formation, its significant side effect of ectopic ossification hampers its further clinical application. Therefore, PGRN may be a novel therapeutic approach for application to bone fracture healing (32Wei J. Zhang L. Ding Y. Liu R. Guo Y. Hettinghouse A. Buza J. De La Croix J. Li X. Einhorn T.A. Liu C.J. Progranulin promotes diabetic fracture healing in mice with type 1 diabetes.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2020; 1460 (31423598): 43-5610.1111/nyas.14208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Unlike other growth factors, however, PGRN still plays a protective role in the progression of OA, which is characterized by abnormal chondrocyte hypertrophy in articular cartilage followed by cartilage degradation. In the present study, we found that under the stimulation of TNFα, PGRN significantly inhibited MMP13 and ADAMTS5 expression, with such suppression being largely nullified in SIRT1−/− chondrocytes. Although PGRN exerts an anti-inflammatory function in inflammatory arthritis murine models, proteolytic cleavage of this precursor protein by serine proteases and metalloproteinases gives rise to individual 6-kDa granulin units, which are actually pro-inflammatory (33Kessenbrock K. Frohlich L. Sixt M. Lammermann T. Pfister H. Bateman A. Belaaouaj A. Ring J. Ollert M. Fassler R. Jenne D.E. Proteinase 3 and neutrophil elastase enhance inflammation in mice by inactivating antiinflammatory progranulin.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 (18568075): 2438-244710.1172/JCI34694PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the function of PGRN during inflammation is complex, with intact PGRN having anti-inflammatory properties, whereas granulins have been shown to promote inflammation. Furthermore, the function of PGRN might be tissue specific. Contrary to its positive effects on cartilage homeostasis, both our findings (34Li H. Zhou B. Xu L. Liu J. Zang W. Wu S. Sun H.

However, many previous researches always assume that decision makers are perfectly rational and neglect the behavioral concerns of decision makers. This paper considers a two-stage sustainable supply chain with behavioral concerns in order to develop more realistic models, and mainly focuses on the energy-saving and pricing decisions in the decentralized system, as well as how to improve energy-saving level and profits. We develop decentralized decision-making models under two types of behavioral concerns: fairness concern and risk aversion, and derive the optimal strategy for each member with a Stackelberg game in which the manufacturer acts as the leader. The effect of the behavioral concerns on the optimal decisions and corresponding profits is discussed in detail. Theoretical analysis verified by numerical experiments shows that the fairness behavior always causes a negative effect on the manufacturer, total supply chain, and energy conservation, while it could benefit the retailer in profits. The risk aversion behavior always benefits the manufacturer, total supply chain, and energy conservation, whereas it could make the retailer suffer. Note that both the optimal energy-saving level and corresponding profit of the total supply chain under two types of behavioral concerns are lower than that in the centralized system, thereby we propose a revenue-cost-sharing contract to coordinate the supply chain, under which both the manufacturer and the retailer can achieve a win-win outcome and the energy-saving level can be improved. In addition, some managerial implications through our analytical and numerical results are summarized in this paper."

Despite newer modalities for diagnosis and treatment, people are still suffering from this disease. Understanding the common gene mutations conferring rifampicin and isoniazid resistance is crucial for the implementation of effective molecular tools at local and national levels. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the molecular detection of rifampicin and isoniazid-resistant gene mutations in M.tuberculosis isolates in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Health Center-based cross-sectional study was conducted between January and September 2017 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The collected sputum samples were processed for mycobacterial isolation and Region of difference 9 based polymerase chain reaction for species identification. To characterize the rifampicin and isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, a molecular genetic assay (GenoType MTBDRplus) was used; the assay is based on DNA-STRIP technology.Culture positivity was confirmed in 82.6% (190/230) of smear-positive newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis cases enrolled in the study. From 190 isolates 93.2% were sensitive for both rifampicin and isoniazid, and 6.8% of the isolates were resistant to at least one of the tested anti-TB drugs. Gene mutations were observed in all studied multidrug resistance-associated gene loci (rpoB, katG, and inhA). Two isolates exhibited heteroresistance, a mutated, as well as wild type sequences, were detected in the respective strains. MDR-TB case was observed in 1.1% (2/190) of the cases. All the MDR-TB cases were positive for HIV and found to have a history of prior hospital admission.In our finding a relatively high prevalence of any drug resistance was observed and the overall prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was 1.1%.The majority of drug-resistant isolates demonstrated common mutations. Heteroresistant strains were detected, signaling the existence of an M.tuberculosis population with variable responses to anti-tuberculosis drugs or of mixed infections."
https://openalex.org/W3047526461,"The United States suffered a dramatic and well-documented increase in drug-related deaths from 2000 to 2018, primarily driven by prescription and non-prescription opioids, and concentrated in white and working-class areas. A growing body of research focuses on the causes, both medical and social, of this opioid crisis, but little work as yet on its larger ramifications. Using novel public records of accidental opioid deaths linked to behavioral political outcomes, we present causal analyses showing that opioid overdoses have significant political ramifications. Those close to opioid victims vote at lower rates than those less affected by the crisis, even compared to demographically-similar friends and family of other unexpected deaths. Moreover, among those friends and family affected by opioids, Republicans are 25% more likely to defect from the party than the statewide average Republican, while Democrats are no more likely to defect; Independents are moderately more likely to register as Democrats. These results illustrate an important research design for inferring the effects of tragic events and speak to the broad social and political consequences of what is becoming the largest public health crisis in modern United States history."

This task measures stimulus interference, one specific component of behavioral impulsivity, using neutral (i.e. not buying related) stimuli. Deficits thus mirror a general rather than a specific deficit to resist task-irrelevant stimuli.222 participants completed the Stroop Matching Task, the Pathological Buying Screener, and various questionnaires assessing clinical background variables as well as trait-impulsivity.Correlation analyses showed that BSD propensity was associated with poorer performance in the Stroop Matching Task. Multiple regression analyses controlling for related disorders and trait-impulsivity indicated that BSD was the only significant predictor.These findings indicate that BSD propensity is associated with deficits in the stimulus interference component of behavioral impulsivity, mirroring a general cognitive deficit. Since no other disorder significantly predicted the performance in the Stroop Matching Task, this deficit seems to be unique for BSD."
https://openalex.org/W3047196390,"Heart arrhythmia is a pathological condition where the sequence of electrical impulses in the heart deviates from the normal rhythm. It is often associated with specific channelopathies in cardiac tissue, yet how precisely the changes in ionic channels affect the electrical activity of cardiac cells is still an open question. Even though sodium channel mutations that underlie cardiac syndromes like the Long-Q-T and the Brugada-syndrome are known to affect a number of channel parameters simultaneously, previous studies have predominantly focused on the persistent late component of the sodium current as the causal explanation for an increased risk of heart arrhythmias in these cardiac syndromes. A systematic analysis of the impact of other important sodium channel parameters is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the reduced ten-Tusscher-model for single human epicardium ventricle cells and use mathematical bifurcation analysis to predict the dependence of the cardiac action potential on sodium channel activation and inactivation time-constants and voltage dependence. We show that, specifically, shifts of the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation curve can lead to drastic changes in the action potential dynamics, inducing oscillations of the membrane potential as well as bistability. Our results not only demonstrate a new way to induce multiple co-existing states of excitability (biexcitability) but also emphasize the critical role of the voltage dependence of sodium channel activation and inactivation curves for the induction of heart-arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W3047304261,"Previous research has shown that visual attention does not always exactly follow gaze direction, leading to the concepts of overt and covert attention. However, it is not yet clear how such covert shifts of visual attention to peripheral regions impact the processing of the targets we directly foveate as they move in our visual field. The current study utilised the co-registration of eye-position and EEG recordings while participants tracked moving targets that were embedded with a 30 Hz frequency tag in a Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) paradigm. When the task required attention to be divided between the moving target (overt attention) and a peripheral region where a second target might appear (covert attention), the SSVEPs elicited by the tracked target at the 30 Hz frequency band were significantly, but transiently, lower than when participants did not have to covertly monitor for a second target. Our findings suggest that neural responses of overt attention are only briefly reduced when attention is divided between covert and overt areas. This neural evidence is in line with theoretical accounts describing attention as a pool of finite resources, such as the perceptual load theory. Altogether, these results have practical implications for many real-world situations where covert shifts of attention may discretely reduce visual processing of objects even when they are directly being tracked with the eyes."
https://openalex.org/W3047585380,"Background Transcultural psychotherapy (TPT) is an original therapeutic method developed in various forms in France and several other countries in Europe as well as North America to address issues of migrant mental health care when psychosocial, economic, or cultural barriers hinder its accessibility and effectiveness. This study aims to describe the patients referred for TPT in Paris and its suburbs over the past decade, to examine intercultural differences and associations with social, demographic, and clinical variables, and to assess TPT in terms of patient adherence, attendance, and duration of care. Method Retrospective study of 529 patients referred for TPT care, classified in three categories–no treatment, initiated treatment, engaged and continuing treatment. Collection and analysis of social, demographic, cultural, and clinical data, as well as of country of origin, duration of treatment, number of sessions attended (adherence), and number of sessions scheduled. Results In all, 301 patients from 45 countries participated in an 11-month course of care lasting an average of 8 sessions. Most were children, accompanied by their families. The main psychiatric symptoms at the beginning of treatment were depressive, and the main cultural problem identified was the existence of a traditional theory explaining the illness in the family's culture. Patients kept 80% of their appointments for sessions, and attendance was not associated with socio-cultural or clinical variables. Conclusion The high level of treatment adherence and attendance over time suggest that TPT is an effective method for addressing complex symptoms experienced by migrant families. Results highlighted the potential richness and originality of studies based on retrospective medical data."
https://openalex.org/W3047077338,"Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is a rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, caused by mutations in the APTX gene. The disease is characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia and severe axonal polyneuropathy. The aim of this study was to detect the disease-causing variants in two unrelated consanguineous Jordanian families with cerebellar ataxia using whole exome sequencing (WES), and to correlate the identified mutation(s) with the clinical and cellular phenotypes.WES was performed in three affected individuals and segregation analysis of p.W279* APTX candidate variant was performed. Expression levels of APTX were measured in patients' skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, followed by western blot analysis in skin fibroblasts. Genotoxicity assay was performed to detect the sensitivity of APTX mutated cells to H2O2, MMC, MMS and etoposide.A recurrent homozygous nonsense variant in APTX gene (c.837G>A, p.W279*) was revealed in all affected individuals. qRT-PCR showed normal APTX levels in peripheral blood and lower levels in fibroblast cells. However, western blot showed the absence of APTX protein in patients' skin fibroblasts. Significant hypersensitivity to H2O2, MMC and etoposide and lack of sensitivity to MMS were noted.This is the first study to report the identification of a nonsense variant in the APTX gene (c.837G>A; p.W279*) in AOA1 patients within the Jordanian population. This study confirmed the need of WES to assist in the diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia and it emphasizes the importance of studying the pathophysiology of the APTX gene."

https://openalex.org/W3047258604,"Circadian clocks control rhythms in physiology and behavior entrained to 24 h light–dark cycles. Despite of conserved general schemes, molecular circadian clockworks differ between insect species. With RNA interference (RNAi) we examined an ancient circadian clockwork in a basic insect, the hemimetabolous Madeira cockroach Rhyparobia maderae. With injections of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of cockroach period (Rm´per), timeless 1 (Rm´tim1), or cryptochrome 2 (Rm´cry2) we searched for essential components of the clock´s core negative feedback loop. Single injections of dsRNA of each clock gene into adult cockroaches successfully and permanently knocked down respective mRNA levels within ~two weeks deleting daytime-dependent mRNA rhythms for Rm´per and Rm´cry2. Rm´perRNAi or Rm´cry2RNAi affected total mRNA levels of both genes, while Rm´tim1 transcription was independent of both, also keeping rhythmic expression. Unexpectedly, circadian locomotor activity of most cockroaches remained rhythmic for each clock gene knockdown employed. It expressed weakened rhythms and unchanged periods for Rm´perRNAi and shorter periods for Rm´tim1RNAi and Rm´cry2RNAi.As a hypothesis of the cockroach´s molecular clockwork, a basic network of switched differential equations was developed to model the oscillatory behavior of clock cells expressing respective clock genes. Data were consistent with two synchronized main groups of coupled oscillator cells, a leading (morning) oscillator, or a lagging (evening) oscillator that couple via mutual inhibition. The morning oscillators express shorter, the evening oscillators longer endogenous periods based on core feedback loops with either PER, TIM1, or CRY2/PER complexes as dominant negative feedback of the clockwork. We hypothesize that dominant morning oscillator cells with shorter periods express PER, but not CRY2, or TIM1 as suppressor of clock gene expression, while two groups of evening oscillator cells with longer periods either comprise TIM1 or CRY2/PER suppressing complexes. Modelling suggests that there is an additional negative feedback next to Rm´PER in cockroach morning oscillator cells."
https://openalex.org/W3047288543,"Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (GBNPP) in Southeast Alaska is a system of glaciated fjords with a unique and recent history of deglaciation. As such, it can serve as a natural laboratory for studying patterns of distribution in marine communities with proximity to glacial influence. In order to examine the changes in fjord-based coral communities, underwater photo-quadrats were collected during multipurpose dives with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in March of 2016. Ten sites were chosen to represent the geochronological and oceanographic gradients present in GBNPP. Each site was surveyed vertically between 100 and 420 meters depth and photo-quadrats were extracted from the video strip transects for analysis. The ROV was equipped with onboard CTD which recorded environmental data (temperature and salinity), in order to confirm the uniformity of these characteristics at depth across the fjords. The percent cover and diversity of species were lowest near the glaciated heads of the fjords and highest in the Central Channel and at the mouths of the fjords. Diversity is highest where characteristics such as low sedimentation and increased tidal currents are predominant. The diverse communities at the mouths of the fjords and in the Central Channel were dominated by large colonies of the Red Tree Coral, Primnoa pacifica, as well as sponges, brachiopods, multiple species of cnidarians, echinoderms, molluscs and arthropods. The communities at the heads of the fjords were heavily dominated by pioneering species such as brachiopoda, hydrozoan turf, the encrusting stoloniferan coral Sarcodyction incrustans, and smaller colonies of P. pacifica. This research documents a gradient of species dominance from the Central Channel to the heads of the glaciated fjords, which is hypothesized to be driven by a combination of physical and biological factors such as glacial sedimentation, nutrient availability, larval dispersal, and competition."
https://openalex.org/W3023316643,"Whereas governments are increasingly considering affirmative action programs to increase corporate board diversity, the effect of such programs can be superficial as they do not address the underlying problem, which is women’s access to and inclusion in relevant corporate networks. To address this issue, we study the relationship among affirmative action programs (binding gender quotas and non-binding gender targets), director networks, and the number of board positions individual directors hold given their gender. We use personal, professional, and network characteristics of 25,127 unique directors from 2,435 public firms in 32 European countries over the period of 2000 through 2017. We find that in the absence of affirmative action programs, women directors benefit less from their networks than men directors suggesting the existence of a gender gap in network benefits. After the passage of binding gender quotas, this gender gap in network benefits narrows between women and men directors. Overall, this research suggests that binding gender quotas make director networks a more salient tool for hiring women and may help in leveling the playing field in the way these networks are used for achieving top management positions."

https://openalex.org/W3047211200,"Wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV) is an arterivirus that was originally identified in common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand, where it causes severe neurological disease. In this study, serum samples (n = 188) from Australian common brushtail, mountain brushtail (Trichosurus cunninghami) and common ringtail (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) possums were tested for antibodies to WPDV using ELISA. Antibodies to WPDV were detected in possums from all three species that were sampled in the states of Victoria and South Australia. Overall, 16% (30/188; 95% CI 11.0–22.0) of possums were seropositive for WPDV and 11.7% (22/188; 95% CI 7.5–17.2) were equivocal. The frequency of WPDV antibody detection was the highest in possums from the two brushtail species. This is the first reported serological evidence of infection with WPDV, or an antigenically similar virus, in Australian possums, and the first study to find antibodies in species other than common brushtail possums. Attempts to detect viral RNA in spleens by PCR were unsuccessful. Further research is needed to characterise the virus in Australian possums and to determine its impact on the ecology of Australian marsupials."
https://openalex.org/W3047230192,"Low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) is clinically used to modulate inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis. However, its molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. This study aimed to describe the effects of LPLI upon inflammatory, apoptotic and proliferation markers in submandibular salivary glands (SMGs) in an experimental model of chronic disorder, 24h after one time irradiation. Diabetes was induced in rats by the injection of streptozotocin. After 29 days, these animals were treated with LPLI in the SMG area, and euthanized 24h after this irradiation. Treatment with LPLI significantly decreased diabetes-induced high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression, while enhancing the activation of the transcriptional factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein. LPLI also reduced the expression of bax, a mitochondrial apoptotic marker, favoring the cell survival. These findings suggest that LPLI can hamper the state of chronic inflammation and favor homeostasis in diabetic rats SMGs."
https://openalex.org/W3047538254,"Computational algorithms are often used to assess pathogenicity of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) that are found in disease-associated genes. Most computational methods include analysis of protein multiple sequence alignments (PMSA), assessing interspecies variation. Careful validation of PMSA-based methods has been done for relatively few genes, partially because creation of curated PMSAs is labor-intensive. We assessed how PMSA-based computational tools predict the effects of the missense changes in the APC gene, in which pathogenic variants cause Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Most Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic APC variants are protein-truncating changes. However, public databases now contain thousands of variants reported as missense. We created a curated APC PMSA that contained >3 substitutions/site, which is large enough for statistically robust in silico analysis. The creation of the PMSA was not easily automated, requiring significant querying and computational analysis of protein and genome sequences. Of 1924 missense APC variants in the NCBI ClinVar database, 1800 (93.5%) are reported as VUS. All but two missense variants listed as P/LP occur at canonical splice or Exonic Splice Enhancer sites. Pathogenicity predictions by five computational tools (Align-GVGD, SIFT, PolyPhen2, MAPP, REVEL) differed widely in their predictions of Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic (range 17.5-75.0%) and Benign/Likely Benign (range 25.0-82.5%) for APC missense variants in ClinVar. When applied to 21 missense variants reported in ClinVar and securely classified as Benign, the five methods ranged in accuracy from 76.2-100%. Computational PMSA-based methods can be an excellent classifier for variants of some hereditary cancer genes. However, there may be characteristics of the APC gene and protein that confound the results of in silico algorithms. A systematic study of these features could greatly improve the automation of alignment-based techniques and the use of predictive algorithms in hereditary cancer genes."
