https://openalex.org/W1997001969,"Breast cancer affects one in eight women in their lifetime. Though diet, age and genetic predisposition are established risk factors, the majority of breast cancers have unknown etiology. The human microbiota refers to the collection of microbes inhabiting the human body. Imbalance in microbial communities, or microbial dysbiosis, has been implicated in various human diseases including obesity, diabetes, and colon cancer. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of microbiota in breast cancer by next-generation sequencing using breast tumor tissue and paired normal adjacent tissue from the same patient. In a qualitative survey of the breast microbiota DNA, we found that the bacterium Methylobacterium radiotolerans is relatively enriched in tumor tissue, while the bacterium Sphingomonas yanoikuyae is relatively enriched in paired normal tissue. The relative abundances of these two bacterial species were inversely correlated in paired normal breast tissue but not in tumor tissue, indicating that dysbiosis is associated with breast cancer. Furthermore, the total bacterial DNA load was reduced in tumor versus paired normal and healthy breast tissue as determined by quantitative PCR. Interestingly, bacterial DNA load correlated inversely with advanced disease, a finding that could have broad implications in diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. Lastly, we observed lower basal levels of antibacterial response gene expression in tumor versus healthy breast tissue. Taken together, these data indicate that microbial DNA is present in the breast and that bacteria or their components may influence the local immune microenvironment. Our findings suggest a previously unrecognized link between dysbiosis and breast cancer which has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications."

However, only limited research has been conducted in this area, and ambiguity remains as those limited previous studies used different approaches to identify common clusters and findings may vary with approaches. This study estimates the prevalence of common chronic diseases and examines co-occurrence of diseases using four approaches: (i) identification of the most occurring pairs and triplets of comorbid diseases; performing (ii) cluster analysis of diseases, (iii) principal component analysis, and (iv) latent class analysis. Data were collected using a questionnaire mailed to a cross-sectional sample of senior Australians, with 4574 responses. Eighty-two percent of respondents reported having at least one chronic disease and over 52% reported having at least two chronic diseases. Respondents suffering from any chronic diseases had an average of 2.4 comorbid diseases. Three defined groups of chronic diseases were identified: (i) asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, osteoporosis and depression; (ii) high blood pressure and diabetes; and (iii) cancer, with heart disease and stroke either making a separate group or “attaching” themselves to different groups in different analyses. The groups were largely consistent across the approaches. Stability and sensitivity analyses also supported the consistency of the groups. The consistency of the findings suggests there is co-occurrence of diseases beyond chance, and patterns of co-occurrence are important for clinicians, patients, policymakers and researchers. Further studies are needed to provide a strong evidence base to identify comorbid groups which would benefit from appropriate guidelines for the care and management of patients with particular disease clusters."

Antiretroviral measurements in scalp hair have been useful as a marker of long-term exposure in the HIV treatment setting, and hair samples are relatively easy and inexpensive to collect, transport, and store for analysis. To evaluate the relationship between dose and tenofovir concentrations in hair, we examined the dose proportionality of tenofovir in hair in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.A phase I, crossover pharmacokinetic study was performed in 24 HIV-negative adults receiving directly-observed oral tenofovir tablets administered 2, 4, and 7 doses/week for 6 weeks, with a ≥3-week break between periods. Small samples of hair were collected after each six-week period and analyzed for tenofovir concentrations. Geometric-mean-ratios compared levels between each pair of dosing conditions. Intensive plasma pharmacokinetic studies were performed during the daily-dosing period to calculate areas-under-the-time-concentration curves (AUCs).Over 90% of doses were observed per protocol. Median tenofovir concentrations in hair increased monotonically with dose. A log-linear relationship was seen between dose and hair levels, with an estimated 76% (95% CI 60-93%) increase in hair level per 2-fold dose increase. Tenofovir plasma AUCs modestly predicted drug concentrations in hair.This study found a strong linear relationship between frequency of dosing and tenofovir levels in scalp hair. The analysis of quantitative drug levels in hair has the potential to improve adherence measurement in the PrEP field and may be helpful in determining exposure thresholds for protection and explaining failures in PrEP trials. Hair measures for adherence monitoring may also facilitate adherence measurement in real-world settings and merit further investigation in upcoming PrEP implementation studies and programs.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00903084."
https://openalex.org/W1975003353,"The African lion has declined to <35,000 individuals occupying 25% of its historic range. The situation is most critical for the geographically isolated populations in West Africa, where the species is considered regionally endangered. Elevating their conservation significance, recent molecular studies establish the genetic distinctiveness of West and Central African lions from other extant African populations. Interventions to save West African lions are urgently required. However formulating effective conservation strategies has been hampered by a lack of data on the species' current distribution, status, and potential management deficiencies of protected areas (PAs) harboring lions. Our study synthesized available expert opinion and field data to close this knowledge gap, and formulate recommendations for the conservation of West African lions. We undertook lion surveys in 13 large (>500 km²) PAs and compiled evidence of lion presence/absence for a further eight PAs. All PAs were situated within Lion Conservation Units, geographical units designated as priority lion areas by wildlife experts at a regional lion conservation workshop in 2005. Lions were confirmed in only 4 PAs, and our results suggest that only 406 (273-605) lions remain in West Africa, representing <250 mature individuals. Confirmed lion range is estimated at 49,000 km², or 1.1% of historical range in West Africa. PAs retaining lions were larger than PAs without lions and had significantly higher management budgets. We encourage revision of lion taxonomy, to recognize the genetic distinctiveness of West African lions and highlight their potentially unique conservation value. Further, we call for listing of the lion as critically endangered in West Africa, under criterion C2a(ii) for populations with <250 mature individuals. Finally, considering the relative poverty of lion range states in West Africa, we call for urgent mobilization of investment from the international community to assist range states to increase management effectiveness of PAs retaining lions."
https://openalex.org/W2147017754,"Oxicams are widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but little is known about the molecular basis of the interaction with their target enzymes, the cyclooxygenases (COX). Isoxicam is a nonselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 whereas meloxicam displays some selectivity for COX-2. Here we report crystal complexes of COX-2 with isoxicam and meloxicam at 2.0 and 2.45 angstroms, respectively, and a crystal complex of COX-1 with meloxicam at 2.4 angstroms. These structures reveal that the oxicams bind to the active site of COX-2 using a binding pose not seen with other NSAIDs through two highly coordinated water molecules. The 4-hydroxyl group on the thiazine ring partners with Ser-530 via hydrogen bonding, and the heteroatom of the carboxamide ring of the oxicam scaffold interacts with Tyr-385 and Ser-530 through a highly coordinated water molecule. The nitrogen atom of the thiazine and the oxygen atom of the carboxamide bind to Arg-120 and Tyr-355 via another highly ordered water molecule. The rotation of Leu-531 in the structure opens a novel binding pocket, which is not utilized for the binding of other NSAIDs. In addition, a detailed study of meloxicam·COX-2 interactions revealed that mutation of Val-434 to Ile significantly reduces inhibition by meloxicam due to subtle changes around Phe-518, giving rise to the preferential inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1."
https://openalex.org/W1964390622,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder associated with an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. It is characterised by raised maternal serum bile acids, which are believed to cause the adverse outcomes. ICP is commonly treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). This study aimed to determine the fetal and maternal bile acid profiles in normal and ICP pregnancies, and to examine the effect of UDCA treatment. Matched maternal and umbilical cord serum samples were collected from untreated ICP (n = 18), UDCA-treated ICP (n = 46) and uncomplicated pregnancy (n = 15) cases at the time of delivery. Nineteen individual bile acids were measured using HPLC-MS/MS. Maternal and fetal serum bile acids are significantly raised in ICP compared with normal pregnancy (p = <0.0001 and <0.05, respectively), predominantly due to increased levels of conjugated cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid. There are no differences between the umbilical cord artery and cord vein levels of the major bile acid species. The feto-maternal gradient of bile acids is reversed in ICP. Treatment with UDCA significantly reduces serum bile acids in the maternal compartment (p = <0.0001), thereby reducing the feto-maternal transplacental gradient. UDCA-treatment does not cause a clinically important increase in lithocholic acid (LCA) concentrations. ICP is associated with significant quantitative and qualitative changes in the maternal and fetal bile acid pools. Treatment with UDCA reduces the level of bile acids in both compartments and reverses the qualitative changes. We have not found evidence to support the suggestion that UDCA treatment increases fetal LCA concentrations to deleterious levels."
https://openalex.org/W2054951817,"Narrow migration corridors known in diurnal, social migrants such as raptors, storks and geese are thought to be caused by topographical leading line effects in combination with learning detailed routes across generations. Here, we document narrow-front migration in a nocturnal, solitary migrant, the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus, using satellite telemetry. We tracked the migration of adult cuckoos from the breeding grounds in southern Scandinavia (n = 8), to wintering sites in south-western Central Africa (n = 6) and back to the breeding grounds (n = 3). Migration patterns were very complex; in addition to the breeding and wintering sites, six different stopover sites were identified during the 16,000 km annual route that formed a large-scale clockwise loop. Despite this complexity, individuals showed surprisingly similar migration patterns, with very little variation between routes. We compared observed tracks with simulated routes based on vector orientation (with and without effects of barriers on orientation and survival). Observed distances between routes were often significantly smaller than expected if the routes were established on the basis of an innate vector orientation programme. Average distance between individuals in eastern Sahel after having migrated more than 5,000 km for example, was merely 164 km. This implies that more sophisticated inherent guiding mechanisms, possibly involving elements of intermediate goal area navigation or more elaborate external cues, are necessary to explain the complex narrow-front migration pattern observed for the cuckoos in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2084480574,"Disulfide-rich cyclic peptides have generated great interest in the development of peptide-based therapeutics due to their exceptional stability toward chemical, enzymatic, or thermal attack. In particular, they have been used as scaffolds onto which bioactive epitopes can be grafted to take advantage of the favorable biophysical properties of disulfide-rich cyclic peptides. To date, the most commonly used method for the head-to-tail cyclization of peptides has been native chemical ligation. In recent years, however, enzyme-mediated cyclization has become a promising new technology due to its efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Sortase A (SrtA) is a bacterial enzyme with transpeptidase activity. It recognizes a C-terminal penta-amino acid motif, LPXTG, and cleaves the amide bond between Thr and Gly to form a thioacyl-linked intermediate. This intermediate undergoes nucleophilic attack by an N-terminal poly-Gly sequence to form an amide bond between the Thr and N-terminal Gly. Here, we demonstrate that sortase A can successfully be used to cyclize a variety of small disulfide-rich peptides, including the cyclotide kalata B1, α-conotoxin Vc1.1, and sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1. These peptides range in size from 14 to 29 amino acids and contain three, two, or one disulfide bond, respectively, within their head-to-tail cyclic backbones. Our findings provide proof of concept for the potential broad applicability of enzymatic cyclization of disulfide-rich peptides with therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1976636554,"Interdomain interactions between the CH3 domains of antibody heavy chains are the first step in antibody assembly and are of prime importance for maintaining the native structure of IgG. For human IgG4 it was shown that CH3-CH3 interactions are weak, resulting in the potential for half-molecule exchange (""Fab arm exchange""). Here we systematically investigated non-covalent interchain interactions for CH3 domains in the other human subclasses, including polymorphisms (allotypes), using real-time monitoring of Fab arm exchange with a FRET-based kinetic assay. We identified structural variation between human IgG subclasses and allotypes at three amino acid positions (Lys/Asn-392, Val/Met-397, Lys/Arg-409) to alter the strength of inter-domain interactions by >6 orders of magnitude. Each substitution affected the interactions independent from the other substitutions in terms of affinity, but the enthalpic and entropic contributions were non-additive, suggesting a complex interplay. Allotypic variation in IgG3 resulted in widely different CH3 interaction strengths that were even weaker for IgG3 than for IgG4 in the case of allotype G3m(c3c5*/6,24*), whereas G3m(s*/15*) was equally stable to IgG1. These interactions are sufficiently strong to maintain the structural integrity of IgG1 during its normal life span; for IgG2 and IgG3 the inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds are essential to prevent half-molecule dissociation, whereas the labile hinge disulfide bonds favor half-molecule exchange in vivo for IgG4."
https://openalex.org/W1984549167,"Convergent studies suggest that morphological abnormalities of frontal-subcortical circuits which involved with emotional and cognitive processing may contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Antidepressant treatment which has been reported to reverse the functional abnormalities of frontal-subcortical circuits in MDD may have treating effects to related brain morphological abnormalities. In this study, we used voxel-based morphometry method to investigate whole brain structural abnormalities in single episode, medication-naïve MDD patients. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of an 8 weeks pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine.28 single episode, medication-naïve MDD participants and 28 healthy controls (HC) acquired the baseline high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scan. 24 MDD participants acquired a follow-up sMRI scan after 8 weeks antidepressant treatment. Gray matter volumetric (GMV) difference between groups was examined.Medication-naïve MDD had significantly decreased GMV in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left middle frontal gyrus as well as increased GMV in the left thalamus and right insula compared to HC (P<0.05, corrected). Moreover, treated MDD had significantly increased GMV in the left middle frontal gyrus and right orbitofrontal cortex compared to HC (P<0.05, corrected). No difference on GMV was detected between medication-naïve MDD group and treated MDD group.This study of single episode, medication-naïve MDD subjects demonstrated structural abnormalities of frontal-subcortical circuitsin the early stage of MDD and the effects of 8 weeks successful antidepressant treatment, suggesting these abnormalities may play an important role in the neuropathophysiology of MDD at its onset."
https://openalex.org/W2016676279,"Synaptic GABAA receptors (GABAARs) mediate most of the inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. The majority of these receptors are comprised of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits. The amygdala, a structure involved in processing emotional stimuli, expresses α2 and γ1 subunits at high levels. The effect of these subunits on GABAAR-mediated synaptic transmission is not known. Understanding the influence of these subunits on GABAAR-mediated synaptic currents may help in identifying the roles and locations of amygdala synapses that contain these subunits. Here, we describe the biophysical and synaptic properties of pure populations of α1β2γ2, α2β2γ2, α1β2γ1 and α2β2γ1 GABAARs. Their synaptic properties were examined in engineered synapses, whereas their kinetic properties were studied using rapid agonist application, and single channel recordings. All macropatch currents activated rapidly (<1 ms) and deactivated as a function of the α-subunit, with α2-containing GABAARs consistently deactivating ∼10-fold more slowly. Single channel analysis revealed that the slower current decay of α2-containing GABAARs was due to longer burst durations at low GABA concentrations, corresponding to a ∼4-fold higher affinity for GABA. Synaptic currents revealed a different pattern of activation and deactivation to that of macropatch data. The inclusion of α2 and γ1 subunits slowed both the activation and deactivation rates, suggesting that receptors containing these subunits cluster more diffusely at synapses. Switching the intracellular domains of the γ2 and γ1 subunits substantiated this inference. Because this region determines post-synaptic localization, we hypothesize that GABAARs containing γ1 and γ2 use different mechanisms for synaptic clustering.

https://openalex.org/W2075060412,"CD44 has been implicated in a diverse array of cell behaviors and in a diverse range of signaling pathway activations under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We have documented a role for CD44 in mediating vascular barrier integrity via regulation of PECAM-1 (CD31) expression. We now report our findings on the roles of CD44 in modulating proliferation and apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells via its modulation of CD31 and VE-cadherin expression and the Hippo pathway. In this report, we demonstrate persistent increased proliferation and reduced activations of both effector and initiator caspases in high cell density, postconfluent CD44 knock-out (CD44KO), and CD31KO cultures. We found that reconstitution with murine CD44 or CD31 restored the proliferative and caspase activation rates to WT levels. Moreover, we have confirmed that the CD31 ecto-domain plays a key role in specific caspase cascades as well as cell adhesion-mediated cell growth and found that CD31 deficiency results in a reduction in VE-cadherin expression. Last, we have shown that both CD44KO and CD31KO endothelial cells exhibit a reduced VE-cadherin expression correlating with increased survivin expression and YAP nuclear localization, consistent with inactivation of the Hippo pathway, resulting in increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. These findings support the concept that CD44 mediates several of its effects on endothelia through modulation of adhesion protein expression, which, in addition to its known modulation of junctional integrity, matrix metalloproteinase levels and activation, interactions with cortical membrane proteins, and selected signaling pathways, plays a key role as a critical regulator of vascular function."
https://openalex.org/W2038635948,"Aims In Kenya, it is estimated that 60 to 80% of urban residents live in slum or slum-like conditions. This study investigates expenditures patterns of slum dwellers in Nairobi, their coping strategies and the determinants of those coping strategies. Method We use a dataset from the Indicator Development for Surveillance of Urban Emergencies (IDSUE) research study conducted in four Nairobi slums from April 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes information related to household livelihoods, earned incomes of household members, expenditures, shocks, and coping strategies. Results Food spending is the single most important component, accounting for 52% of total households' income and 42% of total expenditures. Households report a variety of coping strategies over the last four weeks preceding the interview. The most frequently used strategy is related to reduction in food consumption, followed by the use of credit, with 69% and 52% of households reporting using these strategies respectively. A substantial proportion of households also report removing children from school to manage spending shortfalls. Formal employment, owning a business, rent-free housing, belonging to the two top tiers of income brackets, and being a member of social safety net reduced the likelihood of using any coping strategy. Exposure to shocks and larger number of children under 15 years increased the probability of using a coping strategy. Policy Implications Policies that contain food price inflation, improve decent-paying job opportunities for the urban poor are likely to reduce the use of negative coping strategies by providing urban slum dwellers with steady and reliable sources of income. In addition, enhancing access to free primary schooling in the slums would help limit the need to use detrimental strategies like “removing” children from school."
https://openalex.org/W2070506262,"The circadian clock regulates a wide range of physiological and metabolic processes, and its disruption leads to metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. Accumulating evidence reveals that the circadian clock regulates levels of metabolites that, in turn, may regulate the clock. Here we demonstrate that the circadian clock regulates the intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA by modulating the enzymatic activity of acetyl-CoA Synthetase 1 (AceCS1). Acetylation of AceCS1 controls the activity of the enzyme. We show that acetylation of AceCS1 is cyclic and that its rhythmicity requires a functional circadian clock and the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Cyclic acetylation of AceCS1 contributes to the rhythmicity of acetyl-CoA levels both in vivo and in cultured cells. Down-regulation of AceCS1 causes a significant decrease in the cellular acetyl-CoA pool, leading to reduction in circadian changes in fatty acid elongation. Thus, a nontranscriptional, enzymatic loop is governed by the circadian clock to control acetyl-CoA levels and fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008129488,"Past research has shown that English learners begin segmenting words from speech by 7.5 months of age. However, more recent research has begun to show that, in some situations, infants may exhibit rudimentary segmentation capabilities at an earlier age. Here, we report on four perceptual experiments and a corpus analysis further investigating the initial emergence of segmentation capabilities. In Experiments 1 and 2, 6-month-olds were familiarized with passages containing target words located either utterance medially or at utterance edges. Only those infants familiarized with passages containing target words aligned with utterance edges exhibited evidence of segmentation. In Experiments 3 and 4, 6-month-olds recognized familiarized words when they were presented in a new acoustically distinct voice (male rather than female), but not when they were presented in a phonologically altered manner (missing the initial segment). Finally, we report corpus analyses examining how often different word types occur at utterance boundaries in different registers. Our findings suggest that edge-aligned words likely play a key role in infants’ early segmentation attempts, and also converge with recent reports suggesting that 6-month-olds’ have already started building a rudimentary lexicon."

Here, we investigate the relationship between selenium levels in the culture medium, selenoprotein expression, and replicative life span of human embryonic lung fibroblast WI-38 cells. Selenium levels regulate the entry into replicative senescence and modify the cellular markers characteristic for senescent cells. Whereas selenium supplementation extends the number of population doublings, its deficiency impairs the proliferative capacity of WI-38 cells. We observe that the expression of several selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense is specifically affected in response to cellular senescence. Their expression is selectively controlled by the modulation of mRNA levels and translational recoding efficiencies.

https://openalex.org/W2007244216,"Recently, we demonstrated that FAM20B is a kinase that phosphorylates the xylose (Xyl) residue in the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region of proteoglycans. The phosphorylation of Xyl residues by FAM20B enhances the formation of the linkage region. Rapid dephosphorylation is probably induced just after synthesis of the linker and just before polymerization initiates. Indeed, in vitro chondroitin or heparan sulfate polymerization does not occur when the Xyl residue of the tetrasaccharide linkage region is phosphorylated. However, the enzyme responsible for the dephosphorylation of Xyl remains unknown. Here, we identified a novel protein that dephosphorylates the Xyl residue and designated it 2-phosphoxylose phosphatase. The phosphatase efficiently removed the phosphate from the phosphorylated trisaccharide, Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate), but not from phosphorylated tetrasaccharide, GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate). Additionally, RNA interference-mediated inhibition of 2-phosphoxylose phosphatase resulted in increased amounts of GlcNAcα1-4GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate), Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate), and Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate) in the cells. Gel filtration analysis of the glycosaminoglycan chains synthesized in the knockdown cells revealed that these cells produced decreased amounts of glycosaminoglycan chains and that the chains had similar lengths to those in the mock-transfected cells. Transcripts encoding this phosphatase were ubiquitously, but differentially, expressed in human tissues. Moreover, the phosphatase localized to the Golgi and interacted with the glucuronyltransferase-I involved in the completion of the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region. Based on these findings, we conclude that transient phosphorylation of the Xyl residue in the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region controls the formation of glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2013522303,"Although receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) is well known as a key mediator in cell survival and death signaling, whether RIP1 directly contributes to chemotherapy response in cancer has not been determined. In this report, we found that, in human lung cancer cells, knockdown of RIP1 substantially increased cytotoxicity induced by the frontline anticancer therapeutic drug cisplatin, which has been associated with robust cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and enhanced apoptosis. Scavenging ROS dramatically protected RIP1 knockdown cells against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we found that, in RIP1 knockdown cells, the expression of the hydrogen peroxide-reducing enzyme catalase was dramatically reduced, which was associated with increased miR-146a expression. Inhibition of microRNA-146a restored catalase expression, suppressed ROS induction, and protected against cytotoxicity in cisplatin-treated RIP1 knockdown cells, suggesting that RIP1 maintains catalase expression to restrain ROS levels in therapy response in cancer cells. Additionally, cisplatin significantly triggered the proteasomal degradation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (c-IAP1 and c-IAP2), and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in a ROS-dependent manner, and in RIP1 knockdown cells, ectopic expression of c-IAP2 attenuated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, our results establish a chemoresistant role for RIP1 that maintains inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) expression by release of microRNA-146a-mediated catalase suppression, where intervention within this pathway may be exploited for chemosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2013764746,"Natural hybridization may result in the exchange of genetic material between divergent lineages and even the formation of new taxa. Many of the Neo-Darwinian architects argued that, particularly for animal clades, natural hybridization was maladaptive. Recent evidence, however, has falsified this hypothesis, instead indicating that this process may lead to increased biodiversity through the formation of new species. Although such cases of hybrid speciation have been described in plants, fish and insects, they are considered exceptionally rare in mammals. Here we present evidence for a marine mammal, Stenella clymene, arising through natural hybridization. We found phylogenetic discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers, which, coupled with a pattern of transgressive segregation seen in the morphometric variation of some characters, support a case of hybrid speciation. S. clymene is currently genetically differentiated from its putative parental species, Stenella coerueloalba and Stenella longisrostris, although low levels of introgressive hybridization may be occurring. Although non-reticulate forms of evolution, such as incomplete lineage sorting, could explain our genetic results, we consider that the genetic and morphological evidence taken together argue more convincingly towards a case of hybrid speciation. We anticipate that our study will bring attention to this important aspect of reticulate evolution in non-model mammal species. The study of speciation through hybridization is an excellent opportunity to understand the mechanisms leading to speciation in the context of gene flow."

One IsdH molecule is bound to each α and β Hb subunit, suggesting that the receptor acquires iron from both chains by a similar mechanism. Remarkably, two near iron transporter (NEAT) domains in IsdH perform very different functions. An N-terminal NEAT domain binds α/β globin through a site distant from the globin heme pocket and, via an intervening structural domain, positions the C-terminal heme-binding NEAT domain perfectly for heme transfer. These data, together with a 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure of the isolated N-terminal domain bound to Hb and small-angle x-ray scattering of free IsdH, reveal how multiple domains of IsdH cooperate to strip heme from Hb. Many bacterial pathogens obtain iron from human hemoglobin using proteins that contain multiple NEAT domains and other domains whose functions are poorly understood. Our results suggest that, rather than acting as isolated units, NEAT domains may be integrated into higher order architectures that employ multiple interaction interfaces to efficiently extract heme from host proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2066258261,"Glycans occupy the critical cell surface interface between hematopoietic cells and their marrow niches. Typically, glycosyltransferases reside within the intracellular secretory apparatus, and each cell autonomously generates its own cell surface glycans. In this study, we report an alternate pathway to generate cell surface glycans where remotely produced glycosyltransferases remodel surfaces of target cells and for which endogenous expression of the cognate enzymes is not required. Our data show that extracellular ST6Gal-1 sialyltransferase, originating mostly from the liver and released into circulation, targets marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mediates the formation of cell surface α2,6-linked sialic acids on HSPCs as assessed by binding to the specific lectins Sambucus nigra agglutinin and Polysporus squamosus lectin and confirmed by mass spectrometry. Marrow HSPCs, operationally defined as the Lin-c-Kit+ and Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ populations, express negligible endogenous ST6Gal-1. Animals with reduced circulatory ST6Gal-1 have marrow Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ cells with reduced S. nigra agglutinin reactivity. Bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that α2,6-sialylation of HSPCs is profoundly dependent on circulatory ST6Gal-1 status of the recipients and independent of the ability of HSPCs to express endogenous ST6Gal-1. Biologically, HSPC abundance in the marrow is inversely related to circulatory ST6Gal-1 status, and this relationship is recapitulated in the bone marrow chimeras. We propose that remotely produced, rather than the endogenously expressed, ST6Gal-1 is the principal modifier of HSPC glycans for α2,6-sialic acids. In so doing, liver-produced ST6Gal-1 may be a potent systemic regulator of hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2052143537,"Protein aggregation into intracellular inclusions is a key feature of many neurodegenerative disorders. A common theme has emerged that inappropriate self-aggregation of misfolded or mutant polypeptide sequences is detrimental to cell health. Yet protein quality control mechanisms may also deliberately cluster them together into distinct inclusion subtypes, including the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) and the juxtanuclear quality control (JUNQ). Here we investigated how the intrinsic oligomeric state of three model systems of disease-relevant mutant protein and peptide sequences relates to the IPOD and JUNQ patterns of aggregation using sedimentation velocity analysis. Two of the models (polyalanine (37A) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutants A4V and G85R) accumulated into the same JUNQ-like inclusion whereas the other, polyglutamine (72Q), formed spatially distinct IPOD-like inclusions. Using flow cytometry pulse shape analysis (PulSA) to separate cells with inclusions from those without revealed the SOD1 mutants and 37A to have abruptly altered oligomeric states with respect to the nonaggregating forms, regardless of whether cells had inclusions or not, whereas 72Q was almost exclusively monomeric until inclusions formed. We propose that mutations leading to JUNQ inclusions induce a constitutively ""misfolded"" state exposing hydrophobic side chains that attract and ultimately overextend protein quality capacity, which leads to aggregation into JUNQ inclusions. Poly(Q) is not misfolded in this same sense due to universal polar side chains, but is highly prone to forming amyloid fibrils that we propose invoke a different engagement mechanism with quality control."
https://openalex.org/W2143789256,"Sialidase removes sialic acid from sialoglycoconjugates and plays crucial roles in many physiological and pathological processes. Various human cancers express an abnormally high level of the plasma membrane-associated sialidase isoform.Visualization of sialidase activity in living mammalian tissues would be useful not only for understanding sialidase functions but also for cancer diagnosis. However, since enzyme activity of mammalian sialidase is remarkably weak compared with that of bacterial and viral sialidases, it has been difficult to detect sialidase activity in mammalian tissues. We synthesized a novel benzothiazolylphenol-based sialic acid derivative (BTP-Neu5Ac) as a fluorescent sialidase substrate. BTP-Neu5Ac can visualize sialidase activities sensitively and selectively in acute rat brain slices. Cancer cells implanted orthotopically in mouse colons and human colon cancers (stages T3-T4) were also clearly detected with BTP-Neu5Ac. The results suggest that BTP-Neu5Ac is useful for histochemical imaging of sialidase activities."
https://openalex.org/W2079567702,"Integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA into the host genome is a critical aetiological event in the progression from normal cervix to intraepithelial neoplasm, and finally to invasive cervical cancer. However, there has been little work on how HPV integration status relates to treatment outcome for cervical carcinomas. In the current study, HPV E2 and E6 gene copy numbers were measured in 111 cervical cancer tissues using real-time QPCR. Integration patterns were divided into four groups: single copy-integrated with episomal components (group 1), single copy-integrated without episomal components (group 2), multicopy tandem repetition-integrated (group 3), and low HPV (group 4) groups. A relapse-predicting model was constructed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to classify patients into different risk groups for disease-free survival (DFS). The model was internally validated using bootstrap resampling. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed to evaluate gene expression patterns in relation to the different integration groups. DFS rate was inferior in the order of the patients in group 4, group 2/3, and group 1. Multivariate analysis showed that histologic grade, clinical stage group, and integration pattern were significant prognostic factors for poor DFS. The current prognostic model accurately predicted the risk of relapse, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (bootstrap corrected, 0.71). In conclusion, these data suggest that HPV integration pattern is a potent prognostic factor for tailored treatment of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2043432690,"The influence of self-reported ""race/color"", geographical origin and genetic ancestry on the distribution of three functional CYP3A5 polymorphisms, their imputed haplotypes and inferred phenotypes was examined in 909 healthy, adult Brazilians, self-identified as White, Brown or Black (""race/color"" categories of the Brazilian census). The cohort was genotyped for CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), CYP3A5*6 (rs10264272) and CYP3A5*7 (rs41303343), CYP3A5 haplotypes were imputed and CYP3A5 metabolizer phenotypes were inferred according to the number of defective CYP3A5 alleles. Estimates of the individual proportions of Amerindian, African and European ancestry were available for the entire cohort. Multinomial log-linear regression models were applied to infer the statistical association between the distribution of CYP3A5 alleles, haplotypes and phenotypes (response variables), and self-reported Color, geographical region and ancestry (explanatory variables). We found that Color per se or in combination with geographical region associates significantly with the distribution of CYP3A5 variant alleles and CYP3A5 metabolizer phenotypes, whereas geographical region per se influences the frequency distribution of CYP3A5 variant alleles. The odds of having the default CYP3A5*3 allele and the poor metabolizer phenotype increases continuously with the increase of European ancestry and decrease of African ancestry. The opposite trend is observed in relation to CYP3A5*6, CYP3A5*7, the default CYP3A5*1 allele, and both the extensive and intermediate phenotypes. No significant effect of Amerindian ancestry on the distribution of CYP3A5 alleles or phenotypes was observed. In conclusion, this study strongly supports the notion that the intrinsic heterogeneity of the Brazilian population must be acknowledged in the design and interpretation of pharmacogenomic studies, and dealt with as a continuous variable, rather than proportioned in arbitrary categories that do not capture the diversity of the population. The relevance of this work extrapolates the Brazilian borders, and extends to other admixed peoples of the Americas, with ancestral roots in Europe, Africa and the American continent."
https://openalex.org/W1973421400,"Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and causes 1.38 million deaths annually, as of 2008 worldwide. Identifying natural anti-lung cancer agents has become very important. Gambogenic acid (GNA) is one of the active compounds of Gamboge, a traditional medicine that was used as a drastic purgative, emetic, or vermifuge for treating tapeworm. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that GNA exerts promising anti-tumor effects; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present paper, we found that GNA could induce the formation of vacuoles, which was linked with autophagy in A549 and HeLa cells. Further studies revealed that GNA triggers the initiation of autophagy based on the results of MDC staining, AO staining, accumulation of LC3 II, activation of Beclin 1 and phosphorylation of P70S6K. However, degradation of p62 was disrupted and free GFP could not be released in GNA treated cells, which indicated a block in the autophagy flux. Further studies demonstrated that GNA blocks the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes by inhibiting acidification in lysosomes. This dysfunctional autophagy plays a pro-death role in GNA-treated cells by activating p53, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 while decreasing Bcl-2. Beclin 1 knockdown greatly decreased GNA-induced cell death and the effects on p53, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2. Similar results were obtained using a xenograft model. Our findings show, for the first time, that GNA can cause aberrant autophagy to induce cell death and may suggest the potential application of GNA as a tool or viable drug in anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2060578809,"Apolipoprotein (apo)A-IV plays important roles in dietary lipid and glucose metabolism, and knowledge of its structure is required to fully understand the molecular basis of these functions. However, typical of the entire class of exchangeable apolipoproteins, its dynamic nature and affinity for lipid has posed challenges to traditional high resolution structural approaches. We previously reported an x-ray crystal structure of a dimeric truncation mutant of apoA-IV, which showed a unique helix-swapping molecular interface. Unfortunately, the structures of the N and C termini that are important for lipid binding were not visualized. To build a more complete model, we used chemical cross-linking to derive distance constraints across the full-length protein. The approach was enhanced with stable isotope labeling to overcome ambiguities in determining molecular span of the cross-links given the remarkable similarities in the monomeric and dimeric apoA-IV structures. Using 51 distance constraints, we created a starting model for full-length monomeric apoA-IV and then subjected it to two modeling approaches: (i) molecular dynamics simulations and (ii) fitting to small angle x-ray scattering data. This resulted in the most detailed models yet for lipid-free monomeric or dimeric apoA-IV. Importantly, these models were of sufficient detail to direct the experimental identification of new functional residues that participate in a ""clasp"" mechanism to modulate apoA-IV lipid affinity. The isotope-assisted cross-linking approach should prove useful for further study of this family of apolipoproteins in both the lipid-free and -bound states."
https://openalex.org/W2020185860,"The Seoul National University Renal Stone Complexity (S-ReSC) scoring system was developed to predict the stone-free rate (SFR) after single-tract percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). This study is an external validation of this scoring system.A retrospective review included 327 patients who underwent PCNL at 2 tertiary referral centers. The S-ReSC score was assigned from 1 to 9 based on the number of sites involved. The stone free status was defined as either complete clearance or clinically insignificant residual fragments <4 mm in size at 1 month follow-up imaging. Inter-observer and test-retest reliabilities were evaluated. The statistical performance of the prediction model was assessed by its predictive accuracy, predictive probability, and clinical usefulness.The overall SFR was 65.4%. SFRs were 83.9%, 47.6%, and 21.4% in low (1-2), intermediate (3-4), and high (5-9) score groups, respectively, with significant differences (P<0.001). Inter-observer and test-retest reliabilities revealed almost perfect agreements. External validation of the S-ReSC scoring system revealed an AUC of 0.731 (95% CI 0.675-0.788). The AUC of 3-titered S-ReSC score groups was 0.691 (95% CI, 0.629-0.753). The calibration plot showed that the predicted probability of SFR had a concordance comparable to that of the observed frequency. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic revealed an adequate performance of the predictive model (P = 0.10). Inter-observer and test-retest reliability showed a good level of agreement.The S-ReSC scoring system is useful in predicting the post-PCNL SFR and in describing the complexity of renal stones."

These studies demonstrate that pharmacological manipulation of NMDARs can influence GABABR surface expression and endosomal trafficking. However, they rely on the sustained bath application of relatively high doses of agonist that will activate all functional NMDARs. This is an important consideration because it is well established that NMDAR activation can be either beneficial or cytotoxic, depending on the location and intensity of stimulation. Activation of synaptic NMDARs is a trigger for synaptic plasticity and can be neuroprotective via nuclear Ca2+ signaling, whereas prolonged activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs promotes cell death (24Hardingham G.E.

The medium was then exchanged for OGD medium previously bubbled with N2/CO2 (95%/5%) for 10 min. The cultures were then transferred to an anaerobic chamber at 37 °C with N2-enriched atmosphere, where they were maintained for 30, 45, or 60 min. After OGD, the cells were removed from the chamber, washed twice with PBS, and processed either for biotinylation or imaging. Where appropriate, drugs were incorporated in culture medium and in OGD medium during the indicated periods. Neurons were biotinylated using the membrane impermeable and cleavable biotinylation reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) (0.15 mg/ml in PBS, Pierce) for 10 min at 4 °C as described previously (29Martin S. Henley J.M. Activity-dependent endocytic sorting of kainate receptors to recycling or degradation pathways.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The intracellular protein β-actin was used as a control. Bands were quantified using NIH ImageJ software (version 1.30) and normalized to the total receptor fraction. Unpaired Student's t tests were performed with a Newman-Keuls post-test for multiple comparison data sets. GABABR endocytosis and recycling was measured by the decrease of internalized GABABRs labeled with cleavable (S = S linked) biotin. Cortical cultures were surface biotinylated as described above, and cells were transferred to 37 °C for 30 min to allow endocytosis to occur. Cells were then activated by chemLTP protocol and incubated for the times indicated to allow internalized receptors to recycle back to the surface. The cells were then cooled to 4 °C and incubated with glutathione cleavage buffer (twice for 15 min each at 4 °C) to ensure complete cleavage of surface biotin. Cells were then washed twice with 10 mm iodoacetamide-PBS solution to quench excess glutathione. Residual biotinylated (internalized) receptors were then isolated by streptavidin pull down, and GABABR subunits were detected by Western blotting. The rate of disappearance of biotinylated GABABRs provides a measure of receptor recycling. Leupeptin was included throughout to block protein degradation. Imaging was perfomed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Dissociated hippocampal neurons were transfected with pHA-GABAB2 expression vector and used 48 h later. At the beginning of the experiment, HA-reactive sites on the cell surface of neurons expressing HA-GABAB2 were labeled with an excess of anti-HA coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200) at the same time as the glycine/vehicle application (LTP protocol described above). Neurons were quickly washed twice in LTP buffer, and the fluorescence at time zero was acquired. Cells were kept a further 10 min in LTP buffer without glycine and incubated again with HA-Alexa Fluor 488 to label the newly surface inserted HA-GABAB2. Neurons were quickly washed twice, and the fluorescence at 10 min was acquired. The same process was repeated for 20 min. Green fluorescence at 0, 10, and 20 min were recorded in the same cell as a series of Z stacks (0.25-μm spacing between single confocal slices). The rate of receptors recycled or exocytosed in an individual cell was then determined from the zero control (t = 0) conditions in the same cell as an increase in the fluorescence after 10 and 20 min. Differences in expression were normalized to the mean of the fluorescence at time zero. Statistical analysis of differences between experimental groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey's test calculated using SigmaStat software. Neurons were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 Transferrin (10 μg/ml) in serum-free Neurobasal media for 30 min at 37 °C to reach equilibrium. Cells were then washed with PBS twice, and LTP or OGD protocols were performed as described above. After the indicated times, cells were washed twice and processed for immunostaining. Cells transduced with Rab viruses were incubated for 12 to 14 h to allow Rab protein expression before they were used for the recycling experiments. Briefly, neurons were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min and then blocked in 2% serum, 0.02% digitonin for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were then successively incubated with anti GABAB1 or GABAB2 antibodies overnight at 4 °C and with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Confocal fluorescence images from the Alexa Fluor 488, and Cy3 channels were recorded as a series of Z stacks using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning station with an oil immersion 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture objective (Zeiss). Three-dimensional volumes of z stacks (0.25 μm spacing between single confocal slices) were analyzed using image processing and analysis in Java (ImageJ). The degree of co-localization was assessed in whole cell volumes and sub-volumes by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient in the region of interest using a semi-automated algorithm embedded in the JaCoP plugin of ImageJ software (31Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The co-localization plugin also performed a two-step analysis to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient for the original data and for a large set (∼1000) of images randomized with a grain size determined by the point spread function of the microscope objective. If the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the original image was not greater than 95% of the randomized images, then the co-localization analysis did not continue. In addition, user bias in setting analysis parameters was avoided by using an automated thresholding procedure (31Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Histograms presenting the mean correlation coefficient (derived from 19 to 31 cells assessed per treatment condition) are shown with S.D. bars in all figures. Tests of statistical significance for differences between pairwise combinations were calculated using the two-tailed Student's t test. Proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with appropriate primary antibodies overnight after blocking with 5% low-fat milk in TBST (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 471-504Google Scholar). For detection, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma, 1:10,000 dilution) for 60 min followed by substrate incubation with BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (POD) (Roche Applied Science) or SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce). The chemiluminescence signal was detected on Hyperfilm HP (Amersham Biosciences). The steady-state expression of endogenous GABAB1/GABAB2 subunits in cultured cortical neurones (15–20 days in vitro) was determined by surface biotinylation. Under resting conditions 24.59% ± 2.45 of GABAB1 and 49.6% ± 1.19 of GABAB2 is surface-expressed (Fig. 1, A and B). The anti-GABAB1 antibody recognizes both GABAB1a and GABAB1b subunit isoforms, and both are included in the quantification. Consistent with previous reports (19Cimarosti H. Kantamneni S. Henley J.M.

We recapitulated those results by treating neurons with 50 μm NMDA ± 50 μm AP5 (NMDAR antagonist) for 5 min, allowing the neurons to recover for 30, 60, or 90 min and then measuring surface GABAB1 and GABAB2. The amount of surface expressed GABAB1 and GABAB2 was decreased after 30 min and by 90 min after NMDAR activation, and surface GABAB1 and GABAB2 were levels were decreased by 79.3% ± 4 and 86.8% ± 3.3, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the protease inhibitor leupeptin effectively inhibit NMDAR-induced GABABR loss. These data indicate that NMDAR activation causes GABABR degradation (Fig. 1, E and F) and confirm that the stimulation protocols and trafficking event observed in our cultures are directly comparable with previous reports using glutamate as the agonist (10Maier P.J. Marin I. Grampp T. Sommer A. Benke D. Sustained glutamate receptor activation down-regulates GABAB receptors by shifting the balance from recycling to lysosomal degradation.J. Biol.

Activation of synaptic NMDARs mediates synaptic plasticity, whereas activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to excitoxicity (34Hardingham G.E. Bading H. The Yin and Yang of NMDA receptor signalling.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 81-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We therefore used an extensively characterized chemLTP protocol in which neurons were treated with the NMDAR co-agonist glycine (200 μm, 3 min, 37 °C) (25Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T.

This procedure selectively activates only synaptic NMDARs. Strychnine was included in these experiments to block any possible direct effects on glycine receptors. As expected, surface expression of GluA2, was significantly increased using this chemLTP procedure (Fig. 2, A and C) (25Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In direct contrast to the reduction of GABABRs following bath application of NMDA, chemLTP increased surface expression of both GABAB1 and GABAB2 (Fig. 2A). This increase was both rapid and sustained with 38.3% ± 28 and 24.6% ± 5.9 more GABAB1 and GABAB2, respectively, at 5 min and 75.4% ± 17.2 and 55.7% ± 4.3 at 20 min after stimulation (Fig. 2B). The similar profiles for GABAB1 and GABAB2 suggest that, under these circumstances, the subunits are likely to be trafficked together as assembled GABABRs. The peak of AMPAR surface expression following chemLTP occurs between 15 to 20 min after the chemLTP stimulus (25Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T.

We therefore routinely monitored changes at 20 min, but we have also monitored experiments for 40 min with similar results. We also used membrane-impermeant cleavable biotin to label surface-expressed GABAB subunits. After labeling, neurons were incubated at 37 °C to allow constitutive internalization. The neurons containing internalized biotin-labeled GABAB subunits were then subjected"
https://openalex.org/W1972843067,"Many haematophagous insects produce factors that help their blood meal and coincidently favor pathogen transmission. However nothing is known about the ability of Culicoides midges to interfere with the infectivity of the viruses they transmit. Among these, Bluetongue Virus (BTV) induces a hemorrhagic fever- type disease and its recent emergence in Europe had a major economical impact. We observed that needle inoculation of BTV8 in the site of uninfected C. nubeculosus feeding reduced viraemia and clinical disease intensity compared to plain needle inoculation. The sheep that developed the highest local inflammatory reaction had the lowest viral load, suggesting that the inflammatory response to midge bites may participate in the individual sensitivity to BTV viraemia development. Conversely compared to needle inoculation, inoculation of BTV8 by infected C. nubeculosus bites promoted viraemia and clinical symptom expression, in association with delayed IFN- induced gene expression and retarded neutralizing antibody responses. The effects of uninfected and infected midge bites on BTV viraemia and on the host response indicate that BTV transmission by infected midges is the most reliable experimental method to study the physio-pathological events relevant to a natural infection and to pertinent vaccine evaluation in the target species. It also leads the way to identify the promoting viral infectivity factors of infected Culicoides in order to possibly develop new control strategies against BTV and other Culicoides transmitted viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1985619855,"Though the hippocampus typically has been implicated in processes related to associative binding, special types of associations – such as those created by integrative mental imagery – may be supported by processes implemented in other medial temporal-lobe or sensory processing regions. Here, we investigated what neural mechanisms underlie the formation and subsequent retrieval of integrated mental images, and whether those mechanisms differ based on the emotionality of the integration (i.e., whether it contains an emotional item or not). Participants viewed pairs of words while undergoing a functional MRI scan. They were instructed to imagine the two items separately from one another (“non-integrative” study) or as a single, integrated mental image (“integrative” study). They provided ratings of how successful they were at generating vivid images that fit the instructions. They were then given a surprise associative recognition test, also while undergoing an fMRI scan. The cuneus showed parametric correspondence to increasing imagery success selectively during encoding and retrieval of emotional integrations, while the parahippocampal gyri and prefrontal cortices showed parametric correspondence during the encoding and retrieval of non-emotional integrations. Connectivity analysis revealed that selectively during negative integration, left amygdala activity was negatively correlated with frontal and hippocampal activity. These data indicate that individuals utilize two different neural routes for forming and retrieving integrations depending on their emotional content, and they suggest a potentially disruptive role for the amygdala on frontal and medial-temporal regions during negative integration."
https://openalex.org/W2025897452,"Vaccination is an important strategy in the prevention of influenza, but immunologic response to vaccination can vary widely. Recent studies have shown an association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and immune function. The purpose of this study was to determine if serum 25(OH)D level correlates with influenza vaccine immunogenicity in children and adolescents.We conducted a prospective cohort study of children age 3 to 15 years of age vaccinated with trivalent influenza vaccine (A/Brisbane/59/2007[H1N1]-like virus, A/Brisbane/10/2007 [H3N2]-like virus and B/Florida/4/2006-like virus) in Hutterite communities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at baseline and immunogenicity was assessed using hemagluttination inhibition (HAI) titers done at baseline and 3-5 weeks post vaccination. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between serum 25(OH)D level as both a continuous and dichotomous variable and seroprotection, seroconversion, fold increase in geometric mean titer (GMT) and post vaccination titer.A total of 391 children and adolescents were included in the study and 221 (57% had post-vaccination HAI titers. The median serum 25(OH)D level was 61.0 nmol/L (Interquartile range [IQR] 50.0, 71.0). No relationship was found between serum 25(OH)D level and seroprotection (post-vaccination titer ≥ 40 and ≥ 320) or seroconversion (post-vaccination titer ≥ 40 for participants with pre-vaccine titer <10 or four-fold rise in post-vaccination titer for those with a pre-vaccine titer ≥ 10).Serum 25(OH)D level was not associated with influenza vaccine immunogenicity in otherwise healthy children and adolescents. Other strategies to enhance influenza vaccine response should continue to be evaluated in this population. The role of serum 25(OH)D level in vaccine responsiveness in other populations, especially those hyporesponsive to influenza vaccination, requires further study."

An additional eight non-diseased donor human hearts served as controls. To relate local ion channel expression change to VF dynamics localized VF mapping was performed on the explanted myopathic hearts right adjacent to sampled regions. Compared to non-diseased ventricles, significant differences (p<0.05) were identified in the expression of 23 genes in the myopathic LV and 32 genes in the myopathic RV. Within the myopathic hearts significant regional (LV vs septum vs RV) expression differences were observed for 13 subunits: Nav1.1, Cx43, Ca3.1, Cavα2δ2, Cavβ2, HCN2, Na/K ATPase-1, CASQ1, CASQ2, RYR2, Kir2.3, Kir3.4, SUR2 (p<0.05). In a subset of genes we demonstrated differences in protein expression between control and myopathic hearts, which were concordant with the mRNA expression profiles for these genes. Variability in the expression of Cx43, hERG, Na(+)/K(+) ATPase ß1 and Kir2.1 correlated to variability in local VF dynamics (p<0.001). To better understand the contribution of multiple ion channel changes on VF frequency, simulations of a human myocyte model were conducted. These simulations demonstrated the complex nature by which VF dynamics are regulated when multi-channel changes are occurring simultaneously, compared to known linear relationships.Ion channel expression profile in myopathic human hearts is significantly altered compared to normal hearts. Multi-channel ion changes influence VF dynamic in a complex manner not predicted by known single channel linear relationships."

The scheme is shown to be unconditionally stable using the von Neumann method. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by applying it on a test problem. The performance of this scheme is shown by computing and error norms for different time levels. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with known exact solutions."

Here, we uncover a role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) in adipocyte signaling. We find that deletion of ERK5 in adipose depots (adipo-ERK5−/−) increases adiposity, in part, due to increased food intake. Dysregulated secretion of adipokines, leptin resistance, and impaired glucose handling are also found in adipo-ERK5−/− mice. Mechanistically, we show that ERK5 impinges on transcription factor NFATc4. Decreased phosphorylation at the conserved gate-keeping Ser residues and increased nuclear localization of NFATc4 are found in adipo-ERK5−/− mice. We also find attenuated PKA activation in adipo-ERK5−/− mice. In response to stimulation of β-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor, we find decreased NFATc4 phosphorylation and impaired PKA activation in adipo-ERK5−/− mice.

https://openalex.org/W1996720606,"Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) have gained importance in clinical and epidemiological research and aim at assessing quality of life, anxiety or fatigue for instance. Item Response Theory (IRT) models are increasingly used to validate and analyse PRO. Such models relate observed variables to a latent variable (unobservable variable) which is commonly assumed to be normally distributed. A priori sample size determination is important to obtain adequately powered studies to determine clinically important changes in PRO. In previous developments, the Raschpower method has been proposed for the determination of the power of the test of group effect for the comparison of PRO in cross-sectional studies with an IRT model, the Rasch model. The objective of this work was to evaluate the robustness of this method (which assumes a normal distribution for the latent variable) to violations of distributional assumption. The statistical power of the test of group effect was estimated by the empirical rejection rate in data sets simulated using a non-normally distributed latent variable. It was compared to the power obtained with the Raschpower method. In both cases, the data were analyzed using a latent regression Rasch model including a binary covariate for group effect. For all situations, both methods gave comparable results whatever the deviations from the model assumptions. Given the results, the Raschpower method seems to be robust to the non-normality of the latent trait for determining the power of the test of group effect."
https://openalex.org/W1965681759,"Multi-decadal increase in shell removal by tourists, a process that may accelerate degradation of natural habitats, was quantified via two series of monthly surveys, conducted thirty years apart (1978-1981 and 2008-2010) in one small embayment on the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Over the last three decades, the local tourist arrivals have increased almost three-fold (2.74), while the area has remained unaffected by urban encroachment and commercial fisheries. During the same time interval the abundance of mollusk shells along the shoreline decreased by a comparable factor (2.62) and was significantly and negatively correlated with tourist arrivals (r = -0.52). The strength of the correlation increased when data were restricted to months with high tourist arrivals (r = -0.72). In contrast, the maximum monthly wave energy (an indirect proxy for changes in rate of onshore shell transport) was not significantly correlated with shell abundance (r = 0.10). Similarly, rank dominance of common species, drilling predation intensity, and body size-frequency distribution patterns have all remained stable over recent decades. A four-fold increase in global tourist arrivals over the last 30 years may have induced a comparable worldwide acceleration in shell removal from marine shorelines, resulting in multiple, currently unquantifiable, habitat changes such as increased beach erosion, changes in calcium carbonate recycling, and declines in diversity and abundance of organisms, which are dependent on shell availability."
https://openalex.org/W2171996065,"In this study we examined the role of phosphatidic acid (PA) in hepatic glucose production (HGP) and development of hepatic insulin resistance in mice that lack 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2). Liver lysophosphatidic acid and PA levels were increased ∼2- and ∼5-fold, respectively, in male Agpat2(-/-) mice compared with wild type mice. In the absence of AGPAT2, the liver can synthesize PAs by activating diacylglycerol kinase or phospholipase D, both of which were elevated in the livers of Agpat2(-/-) mice. We found that PAs C16:0/18:1 and C18:1/20:4 enhanced HGP in primary WT hepatocytes, an effect that was further enhanced in primary hepatocytes from Agpat2(-/-) mice. Lysophosphatidic acids C16:0 and C18:1 failed to increase HGP in primary hepatocytes. The activation of HGP was accompanied by an up-regulation of the key gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. This activation was suppressed by insulin in the WT primary hepatocytes but not in the Agpat2(-/-) primary hepatocytes. Thus, the lack of normal insulin signaling in Agpat2(-/-) livers allows unrestricted PA-induced gluconeogenesis significantly contributing to the development of hyperglycemia in these mice."
https://openalex.org/W1987673622,"Objectives Many randomized and cohort studies have reported a survival benefit with cotrimoxazole prophylaxis without detecting a difference in tuberculosis (TB) incidence by cotrimoxazole status. However, several in vitro studies have reported that cotrimoxazole possesses anti-TB activity. We sought to compare TB incidence and TB diagnostic yield by cotrimoxazole use among participants in a well characterized cohort of HIV-infected adults living in a high TB prevalence region. Methods We analyzed prospective data from a long-term longitudinal cohort of adults receiving HIV care and TB investigations in Soweto, South Africa. Using longitudinal analysis, we compared total and laboratory confirmed TB incidence by cotrimoxazole status as well as all-cause mortality. In addition, we compared TB culture results by cotrimoxazole status. Results In a multivariable analysis, adjusted for sex, body mass index, WHO clinical stage, time-updated CD4 count, and antiretroviral therapy status, we observed an association between cotrimoxazole and an increase in TB incidence (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.2). However, when restricted to laboratory-confirmed TB, there was no association between cotrimoxazole and TB incidence (hazard ratio: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.39, 2.4). In TB cases, we found no difference in the proportion of positive sputum cultures or days to culture positivity by cotrimoxazole status. Cotrimoxazole was associated with a reduction in mortality. Conclusions In this cohort with a mortality benefit from cotrimoxazole, we found an increased risk of all TB among individuals using cotrimoxazole, likely a result of residual confounding, but no association between use of cotrimoxazole and laboratory-confirmed TB. Cotrimoxazole did not compromise TB diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W1997836183,"Community-based peer support has been shown to be effective in improving exclusive breastfeeding rates in a variety of settings.We conducted a cost analysis of a community cluster randomised-controlled trial (Promise-EBF), aimed at promoting exclusive infant feeding in three sites in South Africa. The costs were considered from the perspective of health service providers. Peer supporters in this trial visited women to support exclusive infant feeding, once antenatally and four times postpartum.The total economic cost of the Promise-EBF intervention was US$393 656, with average costs per woman and per visit of US$228 and US$52, respectively. The average costs per woman and visit in an operational 'non research' scenario were US$137 and US$32 per woman and visit, respectively. Investing in the promotion of exclusive infant feeding requires substantial financial commitment from policy makers. Extending the tasks of multi-skilled community health workers (CHWs) to include promoting exclusive infant feeding is a potential option for reducing these costs. In order to avoid efficiency losses, we recommend that the time requirements for delivering the promotion of exclusive infant feeding are considered when integrating it within the existing activities of CHWs.This paper focuses on interventions for exclusive infant feeding, but its findings more generally illustrate the importance of documenting and quantifying factors that affect the feasibility and sustainability of community-based interventions, which are receiving increased focus in low income settings."
https://openalex.org/W2025907729,"Insulinomas (pancreatic islet β cell tumors) are the most common type of functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that occur sporadically or as a part of the MEN1 syndrome that is caused by germ line mutations in MEN1. Tissue-specific tumor predisposition from germ line mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes such as MEN1 could occur because of functional consequences on tissue-specific factors. We previously reported the proapoptotic β cell differentiation factor HLXB9 as a downstream target of menin (encoded by MEN1). Here we show that GSK-3β inactivates the proapoptotic activity of HLXB9 by phosphorylating HLXB9 at Ser-78/Ser-80 (pHLXB9). Although HLXB9 is found in the nucleus and cytoplasm, pHLXB9 is predominantly nuclear. Both pHLXB9 and active GSK-3β are elevated in β cells with menin knockdown, in MEN1-associated β cell tumors (insulinomas), and also in human sporadic insulinomas. Pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3β blocked cell proliferation in three different rodent insulinoma cell lines by arresting the cells in G2/M phase and caused apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that the combination of GSK-3β and pHLXB9 forms a therapeutically targetable mechanism of insulinoma pathogenesis. Our results reveal that GSK-3β and pHLXB9 can serve as novel targets for insulinoma treatment and have implications for understanding the pathways associated with β cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1994194322,"Background International travellers are at a risk of infectious diseases not seen in their home country. Stomach upsets are common in travellers, including on cruise ships. This study compares the incidence of stomach upsets on land- and cruise-based holidays. Methods A major British tour operator has administered a Customer Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) to UK resident travellers aged 16 or more on return flights from their holiday abroad over many years. Data extracted from the CSQ was used to measure self-reported stomach upset in returning travellers. Results From summer 2000 through winter 2008, 6,863,092 questionnaires were completed; 6.6% were from cruise passengers. A higher percentage of land-based holiday-makers (7.2%) reported stomach upset in comparison to 4.8% of cruise passengers (RR = 1.5, p<0.0005). Reported stomach upset on cruises declined over the study period (7.1% in 2000 to 3.1% in 2008, p<0.0005). Over 25% of travellers on land-based holidays to Egypt and the Dominican Republic reported stomach upset. In comparison, the highest proportion of stomach upset in cruise ship travellers were reported following cruises departing from Egypt (14.8%) and Turkey (8.8%). Conclusions In this large study of self-reported illness both demographic and holiday choice factors were shown to play a part in determining the likelihood of developing stomach upset while abroad. There is a lower cumulative incidence and declining rates of stomach upset in cruise passengers which suggest that the cruise industry has adopted operations (e.g. hygiene standards) that have reduced illness over recent years."
https://openalex.org/W2015962670,"In this study, we examine the neural substrates underlying Tone 3 sandhi and tone sequencing in Mandarin Chinese using fMRI. Tone 3 sandhi is traditionally described as the substitution of Tone 3 with Tone 2 when followed by another Tone 3 (i.e., 33→23). According to current speech production models, target substitution is expected to engage the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Since Tone 3 sandhi is, to some extent, independent of segments, which makes it more similar to singing, right-lateralized activation in this region was predicted. As for tone sequencing, based on studies in sequencing, we expected the involvement of the supplementary motor area. In the experiments, participants were asked to produce twelve four-syllable sequences with the same tone assignment (the repeated sequences) or a different tone assignment (the mixed sequences). We found right-lateralized posterior inferior frontal gyrus activation for the sequence 3333 (Tone 3 sandhi) and left-lateralized activation in the supplementary motor area for the mixed sequences (tone sequencing). We proposed that tones and segments could be processed in parallel in the left and right hemispheres, but their integration, or the product of their integration, is hosted in the left hemisphere."

Immunogenicity studies in small animals and Aotus monkeys were used to determine the efficacy of recombinant antigens derived from this region of MSP-1 as a potential vaccine antigen. Aotus lemurinus griseimembra monkeys were immunized three times with a recombinant antigen derived from the Block 2 region of MSP-1 of the monkey-adapted challenge strain, FVO of Plasmodium falciparum, using an adjuvant suitable for use in humans. Immunofluorescent antibody assays (IFA) against erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum using sera from the immunized monkeys showed that the MSP-1 Block 2 antigen induced significant antibody responses to whole malaria parasites. MSP-1 Block 2 antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) showed no significant differences in antibody titers between immunized animals. Immunized animals were challenged with the virulent P. falciparum FVO isolate and monitored for 21 days. Two out of four immunized animals were able to control their parasitaemia during the follow-up period, whereas two out of two controls developed fulminating parasitemia. Parasite-specific serum antibody titers measured by IFA were four-fold higher in protected animals than in unprotected animals. In addition, peptide-based epitope mapping of serum antibodies from immunized Aotus showed distinct differences in epitope specificities between protected and unprotected animals."
https://openalex.org/W2001308123,"Ret is the receptor tyrosine kinase for the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of neuronal growth factors. Upon activation by GDNF, Ret is rapidly polyubiquitinated and degraded. This degradation process is isoform-selective, with the longer Ret51 isoform exhibiting different degradation kinetics than the shorter isoform, Ret9. In sympathetic neurons, Ret degradation is induced, at least in part, by a complex consisting of the adaptor protein CD2AP and the E3-ligase Cbl-3/c. Knockdown of Cbl-3/c using siRNA reduced the GDNF-induced ubiquitination and degradation of Ret51 in neurons and podocytes, suggesting that Cbl-3/c was a predominant E3 ligase for Ret. Coexpression of CD2AP with Cbl-3/c augmented the ubiquitination of Ret51 as compared with the expression of Cbl-3/c alone. Ret51 ubiquitination by the CD2AP·Cbl-3/c complex required a functional ring finger and TKB domain in Cbl-3/c. The SH3 domains of CD2AP were sufficient to drive the Cbl-3/c-dependent ubiquitination of Ret51, whereas the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain of CD2AP was dispensable. Interestingly, activated Ret induced the degradation of CD2AP, but not Cbl-3/c, suggesting a potential inhibitory feedback mechanism. There were only two major ubiquitination sites in Ret51, Lys1060 and Lys1107, and the combined mutation of these lysines almost completely eliminated both the ubiquitination and degradation of Ret51. Ret9 was not ubiquitinated by the CD2AP·Cbl-3/c complex, suggesting that Ret9 was down-regulated by a fundamentally different mechanism. Taken together, these results suggest that only the SH3 domains of CD2AP were necessary to enhance the E3 ligase activity of Cbl-3/c toward Ret51.

https://openalex.org/W2042788455,"Objectives Both caspofungin and voriconazole were initially approved by the FDA with very narrow indications. Our aim was to evaluate the utilization patterns and comparative effectiveness of these agents early after marketing before any labeling change occurred. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing a large healthcare database in the United States. Patients who received at least one dose of systemic antifungal agent between the years 2001 and 2003 were included. Information was available for each hospital-day including underlying conditions, medications, procedures and disease severity scores. Tests for proportions, trend tests and logistic regression were used for evaluation of utilization. Propensity score analysis was used in comparison of mortality. Results The study cohort included 381,245 patients with serious underlying conditions. In just two years after marketing, caspofungin and voriconazole use increased to 40% of the total systemic antifungal consumption. However, only 3.4% of caspofungin and 12.5% of voriconazole were used as indicated in labeling. In the propensity score analyses, caspofungin was associated with 7% decrease in mortality (OR: 0.93 95% CI: 0.85–0.98). Voriconazole use was not found to be associated with mortality (OR: 1 . 95% CI: 0.89–1.12) Conclusions Caspofungin and voriconazole were mostly used of unapproved indications immediately after their marketing. Although unapproved drug use might be due to a crucial need by clinicians, this may create problems in further antifungal drug development. Our results suggest a survival benefit with caspofungin; however, similar comparative effectiveness studies must be repeated using more recent data."

In particular, we focus on estimation of the mean. The idea of using additive and subtractive scrambling has been suggested under a recent scrambled response model. Whether it is estimation of mean, variance or sensitivity level, the proposed scheme of estimation is shown relatively more efficient than that recent model. As far as the estimation of mean is concerned, the proposed estimators perform relatively better than the estimators based on recent additive scrambling models. Relative efficiency comparisons are also made in order to highlight the performance of proposed estimators under suggested scrambling technique."

Pilus-1 expression is bi-stable and positively regulated by the RlrA transcriptional regulator. To delineate the role of pilus-1 in Experimental Otitis Media (EOM), we evaluated colonization and disease due to a Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) wild type strain (Taiwan19F-14 wt) and its otherwise isogenic pilus-1 and pilus-2 deficient mutant (Taiwan19F-14 ΔPI-1/PI-2-) as well as potential for a chimeric protein (RrgB321) vaccine candidate for prevention of middle ear (ME) disease. Methods Chinchillas were challenged intranasally with either Taiwan19F-14 wt or Taiwan19F-14PI-1/PI-2 deficient mutant. ME status was assessed and direct cultures performed. New cohorts of animals were immunized with RrgB321 or alum. Intranasal challenge with Taiwan19F-14 wt [erythromycin susceptible E(S)] was performed. Subsequently, a second cohort of animals was immunized and challenged with either Taiwan19F-14 wt or a Pilus-1 over-expressing mutant [Taiwan19F-14+pMU1328_Pc-rlrA mutant; E resistant (R)] strain. Pilus-1 expression was analyzed in SP isolated from nasopharynx (NP) and ME fluids by flow cytometry. Results Culture positive EOM developed following challenge with either wild type SP (Taiwan19F-14) or its pilus-1 deficient mutant. Culture positive EOM developed following challenge with wild type in both RrgB321 immunized and control animals. Pilus-1 expression in ME fluids was significantly higher in controls compared to immunized chinchillas. In second cohort of immunized and control animals challenged with the over-expressing Pilus-1 mutant, delayed development of EOM in the immunized animals was observed. Pneumococci recovered from ME fluid of immunized animals were no longer E(R) signifying the loss of the pMU1328_Pc-rlrA plasmid. Conclusion Pneumococcal pilus-1 was not essential for EOM. Regulation of Pilus-1 expression in ME fluids in the presence of anti RrgB321 antibody was essential for survival of S. pneumoniae. Pneumococci have evolved mechanisms of regulation of non-essential surface proteins to evade host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2139024403,"8-Halogenated guanine (haloG), a major DNA adduct formed by reactive halogen species during inflammation, is a promutagenic lesion that promotes misincorporation of G opposite the lesion by various DNA polymerases. Currently, the structural basis for such misincorporation is unknown. To gain insights into the mechanism of misincorporation across haloG by polymerase, we determined seven x-ray structures of human DNA polymerase β (polβ) bound to DNA bearing 8-bromoguanine (BrG). We determined two pre-catalytic ternary complex structures of polβ with an incoming nonhydrolyzable dGTP or dCTP analog paired with templating BrG. We also determined five binary complex structures of polβ in complex with DNA containing BrG·C/T at post-insertion and post-extension sites. In the BrG·dGTP ternary structure, BrG adopts syn conformation and forms Hoogsteen base pairing with the incoming dGTP analog. In the BrG·dCTP ternary structure, BrG adopts anti conformation and forms Watson-Crick base pairing with the incoming dCTP analog. In addition, our polβ binary post-extension structures show Hoogsteen BrG·G base pair and Watson-Crick BrG·C base pair. Taken together, the first structures of haloG-containing DNA bound to a protein indicate that both BrG·G and BrG·C base pairs are accommodated in the active site of polβ.

Insertion efficiencies for G opposite templating BrG by DNA polymerases were similar to those for C, suggesting that persistence of haloG lesion in DNA could cause G to C transversion mutation. Currently, the mechanism underlying potential haloG-induced mutagenesis is largely unknown. We hypothesized that, like oxoG that induces G to T mutation by forming two H-bonds with anti-A using a H-bond donor and a H-bond acceptor on its Hoogsteen edge (14.Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Hou E.W.

As an initial step to test our hypothesis, we wanted to solve x-ray structures of haloG-containing DNA bound to a human DNA polymerase β (polβ), which has been shown to insert a mixture of G and C opposite templating BrG in vitro, albeit with a ∼100-fold reduced insertion efficiency compared with insertion of C opposite G (13.Efrati E.

The human polymerase β gene cloned into pET-30 (Novagen) was transformed into Rosetta2 (DE3) cells. Bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with 30 mg/liter kanamycin at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.6, and cooled to 28 °C for 30 min. Then the protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was grown overnight at 28 °C, harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), and lysed by sonication for 2 min. The suspension was spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and a clear supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer and eluted by the gradient of 250 mm imidazole. After pooling the fractions containing the protein and extensive buffer exchange with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, and 100 mm NaCl, the concentrate was applied to Mono S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare). Then the His tag was cleaved by incubating a mixture of factor Xa and thrombin overnight at 4 °C. To further separate from minor contaminants, human polymerase β was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 200 mm NaCl. After purification, polβ was buffer-exchanged, concentrated to 20 mg/liter, and stored at −80 °C as described. The binary polβ complex containing templating BrG in a single-nucleotide gapped DNA was prepared under conditions similar to those described previously (19.Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Crystal structures of human DNA polymerase β complexed with gapped and nicked DNA: evidence for an induced fit mechanism.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Polβ was complexed with a single-nucleotide gapped DNA containing a 16-mer template (5′-CCGAC[BrG]GCGCATCAGC-3′), a complementary 10-mer primer (5′-GCTGATGCGC-3′), and a 5-mer downstream oligonucleotide (5′-pGTCGG-3′). The resulting polβ-DNA complex was used to obtain binary and ternary complex crystals in the absence or presence of an incoming nucleotide, respectively. The ternary polβ-DNA complex co-crystals with nonhydrolyzable dGTP or dCTP analog paired with templating BrG in a single-nucleotide gap at the active site were grown in a solution containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 14–23% PEG3400, and 350 mm sodium acetate as described previously (21.Beard W.A.

Crystals were cryo-protected in mother liquor supplemented with 12% ethylene glycol and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using either a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF microfocus x-ray generator with R-Axis IV++ imaging plate area detector or the beamline 5.0.3 Advanced Light Source at Berkeley Center for Structural Biology. All diffraction data were processed using HKL 2000 (22.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38549) Google Scholar). The structures of the binary polβ complex with templating BrG in a single-nucleotide gapped DNA and the ternary complex of polβ with templating BrG paired with dGTP or dCTP analog were solved by molecular replacement with polβ with a single-nucleotide gapped DNA (PDB code 1BPX) as the search model. The model was built using COOT and refined using PHENIX software (23.Emsley P. Cowtan K. COOT: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

MolProbity was used to make Ramachandran plots (25.Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

We determined the x-ray structure of a single-nucleotide gapped binary complex of polβ bound to BrG-containing DNA. The structure of the gapped binary complex (PDB ID 4M2Y, see Table 1 for refinement statistics), refined to 2.3 Å resolution, is very similar to that of a published gapped binary structure (PDB ID 1BPX, r.m.s.d. = 0.689 Å) (Fig. 2A) (19.Sawaya M.R.

Protein is in an open conformation, with α-helix N containing Asn-279 and Arg-283, the minor groove recognition motifs, being located ∼10 Å from templating BrG.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParametersGapped binary (4M2Y)aPDB ID codes.BrG·C N binary (4NLN)BrG·G N binary (4NLZ)BrG·C ternary (4NLK)BrG·G ternary (4M47)BrG·C N-1 binary (4NM1)BrG·G N-1 binary (4NM2)Data collectionSpace groupP21P21P21P21P21P21P21Cell constantsa (Å)54.55454.95554.41450.80755.17550.74954.731b79.27179.07579.43879.70679.26780.11480.202c54.91554.91254.79855.68355.294455.27255.109α (°)90.0090.0090.0090.0090.0090.0090.00β105.48106.59105.37107.83107.80107.52106.60γ90.0090.0090.0090.0090.0090.0090.00Resolution (Å)bValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.20–2.27 (2.31–2.27)20–2.26 (2.30–2.26)20–2.68 (2.73–2.68)20–2.49 (2.54–2.49)20–2.37 2.41–2.37)20–2.42 (2.46–2.42)20–2.55 (2.59–2.55)<I/σ>18.4 (3.0)19.4 (2.26)8.5 (1.92)14.8 (2.18)19.6 (2.98)12.1 (1.91)20.6 (2.10)Completeness (%)97.1 (94.8)98.7 (98.3)99.6 (99.5)99.9 (99.9)96.4 (95.4)100 (100)97.3 (85.4)RmergecRmerge = Σ|I−<I> /ΣI where I is the integrated intensity of a given reflection.

Open table in a new tab The BrG gapped binary structure shows that, unlike G or oxoG, unpaired BrG at templating position preferentially adopts syn conformation. The syn-BrG is stabilized by an intramolecular H-bond between the N2 and the 5′-phosphate oxygen of BrG (Fig. 2B). In addition, an ordered water molecule stabilizes syn-BrG by bridging BrG and Tyr-271. The preferred syn conformation of BrG in the templating base position is in contrast with the previous observation that oxoG in the same position exists as a mixture of syn and anti conformers (14.Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Hou E.W. Pedersen L.C. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mutagenic conformation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-dGTP in the confines of a DNA polymerase active site.Nat. Struct. Mol.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that size of C8-substituent may govern base conformation in the templating base position. The presence of syn-BrG in DNA triggers a local conformational change at the template DNA, where the BrG lesion moved ∼10 Å away from the position of G nucleotide residue seen in the published binary complex structure (PDB ID 1BPX) (19.Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H.

To elucidate structural features of polβ performing correct insertion opposite BrG, we obtained a pre-catalytic ternary structure of polβ in complex with an incoming nonhydrolyzable dCMPNPP (hereafter dCTP*) paired with templating BrG. The NH group in dNMPNPP replaces the bridging oxygen between Pα and Pβ, rendering the nucleotide analog resistant to dNMP transfer and hydrolysis. The use of nonhydrolyzable dNMPNPP thus enables the capture of ternary polβ structures bearing the critical coordination of 3′-OH of primer terminus to the catalytic metal ion (26.Batra V.K.

Magnesium-induced assembly of a complete DNA polymerase catalytic complex.Structure. 2006; 14: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These nonhydrolyzable dNMPNPP nucleotides have been shown to have active-site coordination essentially identical to that of their natural nucleotides (e.g. PDB ID 2FMP and 2FMS (26.Batra V.K.

The BrG·C ternary structure (PDB ID 4NLK) was refined to 2.5 Å resolution. The overall structure of the BrG·C ternary complex is very similar to that of published ternary structures with correct base pair, which assumes co-planar base pair conformation and closed protein conformation (PDB ID 2FMS, r.m.s.d. = 0.299 Å; PDB ID 2FMP, r.m.s.d. = 0.295 Å) (Fig. 3A) (26.Batra V.K.

Magnesium-induced assembly of a complete DNA polymerase catalytic complex.Structure. 2006; 14: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Open-to-closed conformational activation of polβ for correct nucleotide incorporation typically involves the movement of α-helix N and the change in H-bonding interactions of Asn-279, Arg-283, and Tyr-271 with DNA (15.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Structure and mechanism of DNA polymerase β.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the BrG·C ternary structure, the α-helix N moved ∼10 Å from the position in the gapped binary complex to sandwich the nascent BrG·C base pair between the primer terminus base pair and α-helix N. In addition, Asn-279, Arg-283, and Tyr-271 engage in H-bonding interactions with the minor groove edges of the incoming nucleotide, templating base, and primer terminus, respectively. The BrG·C ternary structure shows that the BrG·C base pair is well accommodated in the nascent base pair binding pocket of the enzyme. In the BrG·C ternary structure, BrG adopts anti conformation rather than syn conformation observed in the BrG gapped binary structure. The BrG and incoming dCTP* form co-planar a Watson-Crick base pair typically observed in structure with correct insertion (Fig. 3B) (30.Freudenthal B.D. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Wilson S.H. Observing a DNA polymerase choose right from wrong.Cell. 2013; 154: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The BrG·dCTP* is sandwiched between the primer terminus base pair and the α-helix N in closed conformation. The geometry of BrG·C base pair is essentially identical to that of G·C. The λ angles for BrG and dCTP* are 53.2° are 55.1°, respectively (Fig. 3C). The distance between C1′(dCTP*) and C1′(BrG) is 10.7 Å, which is similar to that observed in structure for correct insertion. Our structure provides insight into the slower insertion efficiency for dCTP opposite BrG (13.Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. “Action-at-a-distance” mutagenesis: 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine causes base substitution errors at neighboring template sites when copied by DNA polymerase β.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15920-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Distance between the 3′-OH of primer terminus and Pα of incoming nucleotide (3.9 Å) is longer than that observed in correct insertion (3.4 Å), which would be suboptimal for nucleotidyl transfer. In addition, the 3′-OH of primer terminus is not well positioned for in-line attack on Pα of dCTP*. Furthermore, although the BrG·C ternary structure adopts co-planar Watson-Crick base pairing and closed protein conformation, the coordination sphere of the catalytic metal ion is not complete.
