https://openalex.org/W2096216062,"We evaluated the teratoma-forming propensity of secondary neurospheres (SNS) generated from 36 mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines derived in 11 different ways. Teratoma-formation of SNS from embryonic fibroblast-derived iPS cells was similar to that of SNS from embryonic stem (ES) cells. In contrast, SNS from iPS cells derived from different adult tissues varied substantially in their teratoma-forming propensity, which correlated with the persistence of undifferentiated cells."

However, whether cytokines only influence survival and proliferation of cells that have already committed to one lineage, or if they also influence the lineage choice is unclear. For decades, researchers disputed whether lineage choice of hematopoietic progenitor cells be influenced by cell extrinsic cytokines. Using bioimaging approaches that allow long-term observation of all cells in progenitor cell cultures, Rieger et al. (p. 217 ) now demonstrate that certain cytokines can indeed instruct blood lineage choice."
https://openalex.org/W2015263036,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate responses to pathogen-associated molecules as part of the vertebrate innate immune response to infection. Receptor dimerization is coupled to downstream signal transduction by the recruitment of a post-receptor complex containing the adaptor protein MyD88 and the IRAK protein kinases. In this work, we show that the death domains of human MyD88 and IRAK-4 assemble into closed complexes having unusual stoichiometries of 7:4 and 8:4, the Myddosome. Formation of the Myddosome is likely to be a key event for TLR4 signaling in vivo as we show here that pathway activation requires that the receptors cluster into lipid rafts. Taken together, these findings indicate that TLR activation causes the formation of a highly oligomeric signaling platform analogous to the death-inducing signaling complex of the Fas receptor pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1977241157,"Background The signaling pathways imposing hormonal control over adipocyte differentiation are poorly understood. While insulin and Akt signaling have been found previously to be essential for adipogenesis, the relative importance of their many downstream branches have not been defined. One direct substrate that is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation is the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein, which associates with TSC1 and acts as a critical negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). Loss of function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex results in constitutive mTORC1 signaling and, through mTORC1-dependent feedback mechanisms and loss of mTORC2 activity, leads to a concomitant block of Akt signaling to its other downstream targets. Methodology/Principal Findings We find that, despite severe insulin resistance and the absence of Akt signaling, TSC2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes display enhanced adipocyte differentiation that is dependent on the elevated mTORC1 activity in these cells. Activation of mTORC1 causes a robust increase in the mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which is the master transcriptional regulator of adipocyte differentiation. In examining the requirements for different Akt-mediated phosphorylation sites on TSC2, we find that only TSC2 mutants lacking all five previously identified Akt sites fully block insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling in reconstituted Tsc2 null cells, and this mutant also inhibits adipogenesis. Finally, renal angiomyolipomas from patients with tuberous sclerosis complex contain both adipose and smooth muscle-like components with activated mTORC1 signaling and elevated PPARγ expression. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that activation of mTORC1 signaling is a critical step in adipocyte differentiation and identifies TSC2 as a primary target of Akt driving this process. Therefore, the TSC1-TSC2 complex regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages, at least in part, through its control of mTORC1 activity and PPARγ expression."
https://openalex.org/W2033829446,"Background RNA interference (RNAi) induced through double stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been used widely to study gene function in insects. Recently, it has been reported that gene knockdown in several insects can be induced successfully through feeding with dsRNA. However, it is still unknown whether phenotypic silencing of genes not expressed in the midgut occurs after ingestion of insect dsRNA. Principal Findings Using chitin synthase gene A (SeCHSA) as the target gene, which is expressed in the cuticle and tracheae of the lepidopteran pest Spodoptera exigua, we showed that the growth and development of S. exigua larvae fed Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA of SeCHSA was disturbed, resulting in lethality. In the 4th and 5th larval instars, prepupae, and pupae, the mean survival rates of insects fed the dsRNA-containing diet were 88.64%, 74.24%, 68.43% and 62.63% respectively. The survival rates in the 5th instar larvae, prepupae and pupae stages were significantly lower than those of all controls, and significant lethality differences were also found between dsSeCHSA treatment and dsControl or ddH2O control in the 4th instar larvae. The effects of ingesting bacterially expressed dsRNA on transcription of the target gene, tissue structure, and survival rates of insects were dose-dependent. Conclusions Our results suggest that SeCHSA dsRNA may be useful as a means of insect pest control."
https://openalex.org/W2039543791,"Cyclins are regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin A, the first cyclin ever cloned, is thought to be an essential component of the cell-cycle engine. Mammalian cells encode two A-type cyclins, testis-specific cyclin A1 and ubiquitously expressed cyclin A2. Here, we tested the requirement for cyclin A function using conditional knockout mice lacking both A-type cyclins. We found that acute ablation of cyclin A in fibroblasts did not affect cell proliferation, but led to prolonged expression of another cyclin, cyclin E, across the cell cycle. However, combined ablation of all A- and E-type cyclins extinguished cell division. In contrast, cyclin A function was essential for cell-cycle progression of hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells. Expression of cyclin A is particularly high in these compartments, which might render stem cells dependent on cyclin A, whereas in fibroblasts cyclins A and E play redundant roles in cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1984616248,"Toll/interleukin-1 (TIR)receptor-containing adapters are critical in orchestrating the different signal transduction pathways following Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. MyD88 adapter-like (Mal), also termed TIRAP, is involved in bridging MyD88 to the receptor complex for TLR-2 and TLR4 signaling in response to bacterial infection. We have previously reported an interaction between Mal and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) via a TRAF6-binding motif, the disruption of which inhibited TLR-mediated NF-κB-luciferase reporter activity. Given the recent report of intracellular TRAM localization promoting sequential signaling in TLR4 responses, we further characterized Mal interaction with TRAF6, the cellular localization, and the outcomes of disrupting this association on TLR inflammatory responses. We found that Mal and TRAF6 directly interact in response to TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation, although membrane localization is not necessary to facilitate interaction. Critically, reconstitution of murine Mal-deficient macrophages with MalE190A, containing a mutation within the TRAF6-binding motif, fails to reconstitute the proinflammatory response to TLR2 and TLR4 ligands compared with wild type Mal. Furthermore, Mal interaction with TRAF6 mediates Ser phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and thus controls transcriptional activation but not nuclear translocation of NF-κB. This study characterizes the novel role for Mal in facilitating the direct recruitment of TRAF6 to the plasma membrane, which is necessary for TLR2- and TLR4-induced transactivation of NF-κB and regulation of the subsequent pro-inflammatory response.

Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Upon ligand-induced dimerization the TLRs activate, via their cytosolic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains, the homotypic recruitment of one or more proteins of a family of five cytosolic TIR-containing adapter proteins (2.O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, recruit MyD88 to their receptor complex, as do members of the IL-1 receptor family. MyD88 recruits interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), IRAK4, and then TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which results in the nuclear translocation of the prototypic inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, termed the canonical pathway (3.O'Neill L.A. Immunol. Rev. 2008; 226: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 4.Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8426) Google Scholar), which encodes inflammatory genes such as TNF-α and IL-6. Although TLRs induce common signaling pathways, there is specificity in recruitment of TIR-containing adapter proteins. MyD88 adapter-like (Mal)/TIRAP was the second described adapter capable of mediating NF-κB activation and was responsible for signaling selectively via TLR4 (5.Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M.

TIR domain-containing adapter protein inducing IFNβ (TRIF, also known as TICAM1) was subsequently found to mediate the MyD88-independent pathway leading to TLR4-mediated activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3, which regulates Type I IFN production (9.Yamamoto M.

Importantly, TRIF also mediates downstream signaling from TLR3, independent of MyD88. The TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM, also known as TICAM2) specifically acts to bridge TLR4 with TRIF, where TRAM-deficient macrophages are ablated in their responses to TLR4 activation but not TLR3 (10.Fitzgerald K.A.

Membrane localization of these bridging adapters has further demonstrated the spatial coordination required for transmission of MyD88 (12.Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R.

Mal acts to bridge MyD88 to TLR2 and TLR4 specifically via its TIR domain. The recent description of a Mal functional variant associated with protection against pnuemococcal disease, bacteremia, malaria, and tuberculosis (15.Khor C.C. Chapman S.J. Vannberg F.O. Dunne A.

Furthermore, the recent depiction of the rare TIR domain variant, Mal D96N, which is unable to interact with MyD88 and impairs downstream TLR2/TLR4-mediated responses (16.Nagpal K. Plantinga T.S. Wong J. Monks B.G. Gay N.J. Netea M.G. Fitzgerald K.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; Google Scholar), has emphasized the importance of protein-protein interactions in TLR-mediated signaling and highlighted the need for a greater understanding of how Mal mediates TLR-induced inflammation. We have previously demonstrated that Mal interacts with TRAF6 (17.Mansell A. Brint E. Gould J.A. O'Neill L.A. Hertzog P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37227-37230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) via a putative TRAF6-binding motif (18.Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K.

Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) that when disrupted inhibited TLR2- and TLR4-induced NF-κB activation. However the specificity and biological consequences of this interaction were not clearly defined. Because disruption of Mal function appears to provide a protective phenotype from disease, we endeavored to investigate the specificity of Mal interaction with TRAF6, cellular localization, and what the biological outcomes of disrupting this interaction were on TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory responses. In this study, we demonstrate the direct interaction of Mal with TRAF6 and the localization of this association to the plasma membrane. Critically, reconstitution of Mal-deficient macrophages with wild type Mal reconstituted transactivation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, which was ablated with disruption of the TRAF6-binding motif. Importantly, NF-κB translocation to the nucleus was not affected in these cells. Significantly, whereas Mal-deficient macrophages reconstituted with wild type Mal express the expected pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in response to TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation, cells reconstituted with a single point mutation within the TRAF6-binding motif (MalE190A) display a significantly disrupted cytokine response to TLR stimulation. Together these studies characterize the novel role for Mal in facilitating the direct recruitment of TRAF6 to the plasma membrane, which is necessary for TLR2- and TLR4-induced transactivation of NF-κB and regulation of the subsequent pro-inflammatory response. HEK293 cells, HEK293T cells, and murine immortalized Mal-deficient macrophages (16.Nagpal K. Plantinga T.S. Wong J. Monks B.G. Gay N.J. Netea M.G. Fitzgerald K.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol.

Human monocyte THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and maintained in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere. LPS K235 (Sigma) was repurified as described previously (19.Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J.

GST, TRAF6, and IκBα antibodies were sourced from Santa Cruz. The full-length pDC304 Mal-HA, pDC304 Mal-HA N-terminal (amino acids 1–74), and pDC304 Mal-HA TIR domains (amino acids 74–235) have been described previously (5.Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M.

MalS180L-HA, MalE190A-GFP, and MalΔx3-GFP mutants were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the pDC304 Mal-HA or Mal-GFP template, respectively. Lentiviral vectors encoding the various Mal-GFP gene were generated by subcloning the GFP-tagged cDNA from pEGFP-N1 into pLV-CMV. Gal4-p65(1–551) plasmid encoding the full-length p65 subunit of NF-κB fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain was a kind gift from Lienhard Schmitz (German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany). The Gal-luciferase reporter gene pFA-Jun and pFA-Elk-1 fusion vectors for analysis of JNK and Erk1/2, respectively, were obtained from Stratagene. Mal-GST and MyD88-GST purification have been described previously (20.Dunne A. Ejdeback M. Ludidi P.L. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41443-41451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). MalE190A-GST purification was prepared the same as for Mal-GST. GST-TRAF6-FLAG protein was transformed into BL21-CodonPlusTM-RIL series Escherichia coli (Stratagene) and grown in Luria broth. A bacterial cell culture was grown to A600 = 0.5 under ampicillin selection. Protein expression was induced with 50 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 18 °C. Bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in low salt soluble KalB buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged, and cell pellet was resuspended in high salt soluble buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cell debris was separated by centrifugation (18,000 rpm, 4 °C). Protein purification was facilitated by affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose and removal of GST fusion tag by PreScissionTM (Amersham Biosciences) enzyme cleavage according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293T cells (2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with the indicated plasmids where the total amount of DNA (2.5 μg/dish) was kept constant. Twenty-four h later, the cells were lysed in KalB buffer as described (21.Mansell A. Smith R. Doyle S.L. Gray P. Fenner J.E. Crack P.J. Nicholson S.E. Hilton D.J. O'Neill L.A. Hertzog P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The indicated antibodies (2 μg) or anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads (20 μl, 50% slurry) were incubated with the cell lysates for 2 h, followed by the addition of 40 μl of 50% protein G slurry for 1 h. The immune complexes were precipitated, washed, eluted by the addition of sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies. For GST pulldown experiments, the lysates prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with indicated vectors were used in a GST pulldown assay whereby cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with recombinant GST fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. The complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as indicated in the figure legend. For endogenous immunoprecipitation, confluent THP-1 cells (2 × 107) were resuspended in 1 ml of conditioned medium, centrifuged, and harvested as per immunoprecipitation method. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Immunocomplexes were visualized by using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate solution (Pierce) followed by exposure to x-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Biosciences) to detect chemiluminescence or visualized using the Odyssey fluorimager (LI-COR) and probed with AlexaFluor 680 (Molecular Probes) and IRDye800CW (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with TRAF6-FLAG and fluorophore-conjugated proteins at the concentrations indicated for 48 h at 32 °C. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were immunohistostained with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 1:200 overnight at 4 °C and probed with Alexa Fluor 594 (Texas Red) or Alexa Fluor 488 (Green)-conjugated IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Mounted cells on coverslips were examined with 40× oil lens objective on Leica TCS NT upright confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Welzlar, Germany) using Leica TCS NT LASAF software. Deconvoluation and colocalization was performed using the IMARIS software (Bit-plane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). HEK293 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate 24 h prior to transfection with FuGENE 6. NF-κB-dependent gene expression was determined using the 5× κB-luciferase reporter construct (Stratagene) concomitantly with indicated vectors. Using the PathDetect transient transfection kit (Stratagene), cotransfection of pFR-luciferase in combination with Gal4 fusions p65, pFA-Jun, pFA-CHOP, or pFA-Elk-1, respectively, were used to analyze activation of p65 transactivation and MAP kinase, respectively. The Renilla luciferase-thymidine kinase encoding plasmid (pRL-TK) (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to normalize for transfection efficiency, and pEF-BOS empty vector was used to maintain constant DNA. Transfected cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase and Renilla activity using luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Luminescence readings were corrected for Renilla activity and expressed as fold increases over nonstimulated control values. Nuclear extracts (4 μg) were incubated with 10,000 cpm of a 22-bp DNA fragment oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence (Promega) that had previously been labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 100 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, which were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Macrophage supernatants from virally transduced cells were used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect expression of TNF-α or IL-6 with reagents from BD PharMingen (St. Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA was prepared using the RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Two μg of total RNA was treated with DNase (Promega) before cDNA synthesis using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and random primers in a volume of 40 μl. cDNA was diluted ⅓, and triplicate wells were run for each sample on the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (ABI, Foster City, CA). TaqMan® gene expression assays were conducted using premade kits from ABI, and all of the samples were multiplexed with the endogenous control 18 S ribosomal RNA. Relative gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCT cycle threshold method. For statistical analysis, the data obtained from independent experiments are presented as the means ± S.D. All of the statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad PRISM software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The mean differences were calculated using Student's t test. Analysis of two independent variables was calculated using a two-way analysis of variance. The levels of significance are denoted as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. We have previously demonstrated that Mal interacted with TRAF6 in ectopic coimmunoprecipitation experiments; therefore we first wished to establish whether TLR stimulation induced association between the two proteins. As can be observed in the top set of panels in Fig. 1, TRAF6 immunoprecipitated Mal in a time-dependent manner within 10–15 min of TLR2 (Pam3Cys) stimulation of human THP-1 monocytic cells. TLR4 (LPS) activation also induced the same effect (Fig. 1, middle set of panels), although with slightly delayed kinetics, peaking at 20 min following stimulation. Importantly, TLR9 (CpG DNA) stimulation failed to induce Mal-TRAF6 interaction (Fig. 1, bottom set of panels), consistent with Mal having a specific role in TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Degradation of IκBα was also observed in cells following stimulation, confirming that the respective ligands had activated their relevant TLR. These results demonstrate a specific interaction between Mal and TRAF6 following stimulation of TLR2 and TLR4, but not TLR9, consistent with the described role for Mal in TLR2 and TLR4 signal transduction. Recently, Kagan and Medzhitov (12.Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) demonstrated the critical role of Mal localization to the plasma membrane via an N-terminal PIP2-binding domain in TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Localization to the plasma membrane was required to facilitate MyD88 recruitment to the plasma membrane TLR receptor complex leading to initiation of the canonical signaling pathway and subsequent activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Because ectopic expression of Mal is able to localize to the membrane (12.Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 37227-37230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) mimicking TLR stimulation, we wished to determine whether localization of Mal and TRAF6 occurs at the plasma membrane or the cytosol in HEK293 cells by fluorescence microscopy. We found that GFP-tagged Mal localized to the plasma membrane by costaining with cholera toxin subunit B (supplemental Fig. S1A). We next confirmed that Mal 4KK-GFP (a kind gift from Ruslan Medzhitov, Yale University), which contains point mutations of the PIP2-binding region (K15A,K16A,K32A,K33A) and therefore disrupts Mal membrane localization, and Mal 1–20-GFP, consisting of the first 20 amino acids of Mal lacking the PIP2 membrane-binding motif and functionality, both displayed diffuse staining throughout the cell consistent with earlier reports (12.Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C, respectively). Ectopic expression of FLAG-tagged TRAF6 alone was found in discrete foci scattered throughout the cytosol and did not label the cell surface when compared with cholera toxin subunit B staining (supplemental Fig. S1D). To investigate whether membrane localization was required to facilitate interaction between Mal and TRAF6, we compared wild type Mal association with TRAF6 to Mal 4KK-GFP, because this variant still contains an intact TRAF6-binding motif (Mal 188–193) but fails to localize to the membrane and Mal 1–20-GFP, which lacks the PIP2, TIR-, and TRAF6-binding domains. Initial three-dimensional view image analysis of coexpressed wild type Mal, Mal 4KK, and Mal 1–20 TRAF6 (Fig. 2, left panel) shows that all three Mal proteins are colocalizing with TRAF6 either at the plasma membrane (wild type Mal; Fig. 2A) or in the cytosol (Mal 4KK and Mal 1–20; Fig. 2, B and C). However when three-dimensional iso-surface rendition analysis is applied, where the intensities of the fluorescence of each tag are standardized to remove variance in fluorescence intensity between flurophores, it becomes apparent that although Mal and Mal 4KK colocalize in the same plane as TRAF6 and therefore appear intensely colocalized (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels), Mal 1–20 is clearly not colocalizing in the same plane and therefore is not colocalized with TRAF6 (Fig. 2C, middle and right panels). Similar colocalization of Mal and TRAF6 was observed of Mal tagged with DsRed and TRAF6-GFP (supplemental Fig. S2A) or Mal-GFP and TRAF6-DsRed (supplemental Fig. S2B), indicating that the colocalization at the plasma membrane did not result from the tag and represents a feature of Mal and TRAF6 association itself. To further support these findings we found that both wild type Mal-GFP and Mal 4KK-GFP, but not Mal 1–20-GFP, were able to interact with TRAF6 in coexpression immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2D), confirming that the GFP tag did not affect the ability of Mal and TRAF6 to interact and that association occurs independent of cellular localization. Having established that interaction was not dependent on localization, we next assessed the effects on downstream signaling. We have previously found that Mal interaction with TRAF6 mediated the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and importantly, transactivation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (17.Mansell A. Brint E. Gould J.A. O'Neill L.A. Hertzog P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37227-37230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of these GFP-tagged proteins to drive NF-κB activation (Fig. 2E) compared with our previously reported results using HA-tagged Mal. Consistent with our localization and immunoprecipitation data, both wild type Mal and Mal 4KK were able to induce activation of NF-κB luciferase expression, whereas Mal 1–20 failed to induce a similar responses. Furthermore, consistent with our earlier report (17.Mansell A. Brint E. Gould J.A. O'Neill L.A. Hertzog P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37227-37230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), wild type Mal and Mal 4KK were able to induce NF-κB p65 transactivation and Erk1/2 and JNK activation (Fig. 2F) via reporter assays but critically not p38. As expected, Mal 1–20 was unable to induce activation of any pathway because of its lack of PIP2 and TIR domains. Taken together these results demonstrate that Mal and TRAF6 interact either at the plasma membrane or in the cytosol independent of localization to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the geographical constraint of Mal to the plasma membrane by PIP2 modification may be important for spatial signaling or kinetics. Alternatively, TRAF6 may have a higher preference, but not an absolute requirement for, association for the membrane-bound Mal. The requirement of an intact Mal TRAF6-binding motif for int"

Sortases catalyze a transpeptidation reaction that joins a highly conserved LPXTG sorting signal within their polypeptide substrate to the cell wall or to other pilin subunits. The molecular basis of transpeptidation and sorting signal recognition are not well understood, because the intermediates of catalysis are short lived. We have overcome this problem by synthesizing an analog of the LPXTG signal whose stable covalent complex with the enzyme mimics a key thioacyl catalytic intermediate. Here we report the solution structure and dynamics of its covalent complex with the Staphylococcus aureus SrtA sortase. In marked contrast to a previously reported crystal structure, we show that SrtA adaptively recognizes the LPXTG sorting signal by closing and immobilizing an active site loop. We have also used chemical shift mapping experiments to localize the binding site for the triglycine portion of lipid II, the second substrate to which surface proteins are attached. We propose a unified model of the transpeptidation reaction that explains the functions of key active site residues. Since the sortase-catalyzed anchoring reaction is required for the virulence of a number of bacterial pathogens, the results presented here may facilitate the development of new anti-infective agents.

Bacterial surface proteins function as virulence factors that enable pathogens to adhere to sites of infection, evade the immune response, acquire essential nutrients, and enter host cells (1.Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gram-positive bacteria use a common mechanism to covalently attach proteins to the cell wall. This process is catalyzed by sortase transpeptidase enzymes, which join proteins bearing a highly conserved Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG, where X is any amino acid) sorting signal to the cross-bridge peptide of the peptidylglycan (2.Marraffini L.A.

The search for small molecule sortase inhibitors is an active area of research, since these enzymes contribute to the virulence of a number of important pathogens, including among others Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (reviewed in Refs. 7.Maresso A.W.

It anchors proteins to the murein sacculus that possess a COOH-terminal cell wall sorting signal that consists of a LPXTG motif, followed by a hydrophobic segment of amino acids and a tail composed of mostly positively charged residues (17.Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). SrtA is located on the extracellular side of the membrane. After partial secretion of its protein substrate across the cell membrane, SrtA cleaves the LPXTG motif between the threonine and glycine residues, forming a thioacyl-linked protein-sortase intermediate (16.Ton-That H.

It then catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl group of the threonine and the cell wall precursor molecule lipid II (undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-MurNAc(-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(NH2-Gly5)-d-Ala-d-Ala)-β1–4-GlcNAc)), creating a protein-lipid II-linked product that is incorporated into the peptidylglycan via the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions of bacterial cell wall synthesis (18.Perry A.M.

In vitro studies of SrtA have begun to define the mechanism of transpeptidation. SrtA consists of two parts: an unstructured amino-terminal tail that contains a stretch of nonpolar residues that embed it in the membrane and an autonomously folded catalytic domain that competently performs the transpeptidation reaction in vitro (SrtAΔN59, residues 60–206) (16.Ton-That H.

Catalysis occurs through a ping-pong mechanism that is initiated when the thiol group of amino acid Cys184 nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon of the threonine residue within the LPXTG sorting signal (16.Ton-That H.

This forms a transient tetrahedral intermediate that, upon breakage of the threonine-glycine peptide bond, rearranges into a more stable thioacyl enzyme-substrate linkage. SrtA then joins the terminal amine group within the pentaglycine branch of lipid II to the carbonyl carbon of the threonine, creating a second tetrahedral intermediate that is resolved into the lipid II-linked protein product (23.Ton-That H.

Sortase enzymes contain three conserved residues within their active sites: His120, Cys184, and Arg197 (SrtA numbering).

Although it is well established that Cys184 forms a covalent linkage to the sorting signal, the functions of His120 and Arg197 are controversial. A variety of disparate functions have been ascribed to Arg197. These include deprotonating Cys184 (28.Marraffini L.A. Ton-That H. Zong Y. Narayana S.V. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

Originally, it was suggested that it activated Cys184 by forming an imidazolium-thiolate ion pair (26.Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, subsequent pKa measurements revealed that both His120 and Cys184 are predominantly uncharged at physiological pH values, leading to the suggestion that His120 functions as a general base during catalysis (33.Connolly K.M.

Most recently, it has been proposed that the most active form of the enzyme contains His120 and Cys184 in their charged states but that only a small fraction of SrtA exists in this form (∼0.06%) prior to binding to the sorting signal (25.Frankel B.A. Kruger R.G.

However, in this structure the peptide substrate is bound nonspecifically (see below) (32.Bentley M.L. Lamb E.C. McCafferty D.G. J. Biol.

The structure of the complex resembles the thioacyl intermediate of catalysis, providing insights into the molecular basis of binding of the LPXTG sorting signal and the functions of key active site residues. Notably, the mechanism of substrate binding visualized in the NMR structure differs substantially from a previously reported crystal structure of SrtAΔN59 non-covalently bound to a LPETG peptide (31.Zong Y.

We have also used NMR chemical shift mapping experiments to localize the binding site for a triglycine cell wall substrate analog. A mechanism of transpeptidation compatible with these new data is proposed. Wild-type SrtA from S. aureus containing amino acid residues 60–206 (SrtAΔN59) was produced as described previously (29.Liew C.K. Smith B.T. Pilpa R. Suree N. Ilangovan U. Connolly K.M. Jung M.E. Clubb R.T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Uniformly 15N- and 13C- or 15N-labeled SrtAΔN59 protein was covalently attached to an analog of the LPXTG sorting signal, Cbz-LPAT* (where T* is (2R,3S)-3-amino-4-mercapto-2-butanol, and Cbz is a carbobenzyloxy protecting group). The methods used to synthesize the analog and to prepare its covalent complex with SrtAΔN59 have been described previously (40.Jung M.E. Clemens J.J. Suree N. Liew C.K. Pilpa R. Campbell D.O. Clubb R.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 5076-5079Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Three ∼1 mm samples of the complex were studied. Each was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.0), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3. The complexes contained either 1) 15N-labeled SrtAΔN59 bound to the unlabeled peptide dissolved in H2O (7% 2H2O), 2) 13C,15N-labeled protein bound to the unlabeled peptide dissolved in H2O (7% 2H2O), or 3) 13C,15N-labeled protein bound to the unlabeled peptide dissolved in 2H2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 302 K on Bruker Avance 500-, 600-, and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance cryogenic probes. 1H, 13C, and 15N protein chemical shift assignments were obtained using standard methods (41.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science and Technology, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar, 42.Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chemical shift assignments for the sorting signal were obtained by analyzing two-dimensional (F1,F2) 13C-filtered NOESY (43.Iwahara J. Wojciak J.M. Clubb R.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and (F1) 13C-filtered TOCSY (44.Ogura K. Terasawa H. Inagaki F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) spectra. Distance restraints to define the structure of the protein were obtained from three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra (mixing time 100 ms), and intramolecular restraints for the sorting signal analog were obtained by analyzing two-dimensional (F1,F2) 13C-filtered NOESY spectra. Intermolecular distance restraints between SrtAΔN59 and the bound peptide were identified in three-dimensional (F1) 13C,15N-filtered (F2) 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and (F1) 13C,15N-filtered (F2) 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (45.Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and in a two-dimensional (F1) 13C-filtered NOESY spectrum (43.Iwahara J. Wojciak J.M. Clubb R.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3JHN-Hα values were measured from a water flip-back three-dimensional HNHA spectrum (46.Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), and backbone ψ and ϕ dihedral angles were obtained using the program TALOS (47.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (48.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the PIPP (49.Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and CARA (version 1.4.1) (50.Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. Cantina Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar) software packages. Structure calculations were performed using the ATNOS/CANDID and NIH-XPLOR programs (51.Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 52.Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol.

Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Three three-dimensional NOESY data sets were used as input for ATNOS/CANDID: three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra of the complex dissolved in H2O and a 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum of the complex dissolved in 2H2O. These data were supplemented with restraints for the backbone and side chain dihedral angles. Seven cycles of ATNOS/CANDID calculations yielded a converged ensemble of the protein in the complex. The structure was then refined in an iterative manner by manually checking all of the NOEs assigned by CANDID and by including 3JHN-Hα couplings and carbon chemical shifts in the calculations. New manually identified intra- and intermolecular distance restraints were also added, and at the final stages of refinement, hydrogen bonds were identified and included as distance restraints. The latter were obtained by inspecting the structures of the complex and by identifying NOE patterns characteristic of distinct secondary structures. All of the NOEs within the active site and binding pocket were manually checked. Residual dipolar couplings were measured by taking the difference in J couplings between partially aligned and unaligned protein samples. The protein was aligned using 15% (w/v) charged bicelles (30:10:1 molar ratio of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine/hexadecyl(cetyl)trimethylammonium bromide). The programs MOLMOL (54.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (55.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, LLC, Palo Alto, CA2006Google Scholar) were used to generate figures. NMR data were collected using the 15N-labeled sample of the complex at 600 MHz. The strategy used to collect and analyze the relaxation data has been described previously (56.Naik M.T. Suree N. Ilangovan U. Liew C.K. Thieu W. Campbell D.O. Clemens J.J. Jung M.E. Clubb R.T. J.

Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1140-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The well resolved 1H-15N HSQC spectrum enabled the reliable measurement of relaxation parameters for 86 of a total of 148 residues. The average R1, R2, and 15N{1H} NOE values for the backbone nitrogen atoms in the complex are 1.50 ± 0.02 s−1, 12.28 ± 0.16 s−1, and 0.62 ± 0.10, respectively. The tensor parameters were calculated using the program Quadric_Diffusion, which follows the approach outlined by Bruschweiler et al. (58.Brüschweiler R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 59.Brüschweiler R. Liao X. Wright P.E. Science. 1995; 268: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This yielded a correlation time of 8.56 ns, and the axial symmetric model was preferred over the isotropic model. A total of 76 of 86 quantifiable residues could be fit satisfactorily. The data from Ala81, Val87, Tyr88, Arg99, Ser102, Asn132, Ala135, Lys137, Met155, and Asp165 could not be fit to any model, possibly because they undergo more complicated motions. Residues were classified as follows: model 1 (S2-only) was selected for 52 residues, 2 residues fit to model 2 (S2 and τe), 15 residues fit to model 3 (S2 and Rex), 1 residue fit to model 4 (S2, τe, and Rex), and 6 residues fit to model 5 (Sf2, Ss2, and τe). For residues located in regions of regular secondary structure, the average order parameter is 0.93 ± 0.01. The relaxation data were analyzed using the suite of analysis programs kindly provided by Prof. Arthur G. Palmer III (60.Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 61.Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3399) Google Scholar, 62.Mandel A.M. Akke M.

These studies made use of a 1 mm sample of the complex containing 15N-labeled SrtAΔN59 covalently attached to the sorting signal analog (NMR buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3, and 7% 2H2O, pH 6.0). Triglycine (Gly3) was obtained from Sigma. A 500 mm concentrated stock solution of Gly3 dissolved in NMR buffer was used. A series of two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 302 K after the addition of small aliquots of Gly3. A total of 12 spectra were acquired with the following molar ratios of Gly3 to the SrtAΔN59-LPAT* complex: 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 8:1, 16:1, 40:1, 50:1, 80:1, and 100:1. No significant chemical shift changes were observed after a 40:1 molar ratio was achieved. A normalized chemical shift change (Δδ) was calculated as Δδ = ((ΔδH)2 + (ΔδN/6.49)2)½, where ΔδN and ΔδH are, respectively, the amide nitrogen and proton chemical shift difference for a given residue in the presence and absence of Gly3. The titration experiments using the apo-form of the enzyme were performed in an identical manner. Five single amino acid mutants of SrtAΔN59 containing a COOH-terminal six-histidine tag were produced in Escherichia coli from a pET15b expression vector. The presence of the histidine tag does not affect the enzymatic activity of the protein (9.Mao H. Hart S.A. Schink A. Pollok B.A. J. Am. Chem.

The enzyme kinetic parameters of five SrtAΔN59 mutants (L97A, A104G, E105A, D112A, and A118G) were measured as described previously (24.Huang X. Aulabaugh A. Ding W. Kapoor B. Alksne L. Tabei K.

Briefly, A self-quenched fluorescent peptide, o-aminobenzoyl-LPETG-2,4-dinitrophenyl, was used as a substrate in the cleavage reaction containing 1.5 μm SrtA enzyme dissolved in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with various concentrations of CaCl2). The o-aminobenzoyl-LPETG-2,4-dinitrophenyl substrate was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the reaction to a final concentration"

It is clear that activated macrophages and dendritic cells produce IL-23, but the molecular mechanisms whereby inflammatory signals stimulate IL-23 expression are not fully understood. We demonstrate that induction of IL-23 p19 gene expression by LPS depends on the TLR4 and MyD88 pathways. All three MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38) that are activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation were shown to exert a positive effect on p19 expression. We cloned a 1.3-kb putative p19 promoter and defined its transcription initiation sites by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. By analyzing IL-23 p19 promoter mutants, we have identified a promoter region (−413 to +10) that contains several important elements, including NF-κB and AP-1. In addition to NF-κB, we have demonstrated that the proximal AP-1 site is important for p19 promoter activation. Mutation of the AP-1 site resulted in the loss of p19 promoter activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis showed that c-Jun and c-Fos bind to the AP-1 site, which was confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, co-transfection of c-Jun and ATF2 synergistically induced p19 promoter activation, and c-Jun and ATF2 formed a protein complex, demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from IL-10-deficient mice expressed significantly higher IL-23 p19 than macrophages from wild type mice, and the addition of recombinant IL-10 strongly inhibited LPS-induced p19 expression. Thus, this study suggests that MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling induces IL-23 p19 gene expression through both MAPKs and NF-κB.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The Jun proteins can both homo- and heterodimerize with Fos members to form transcriptionally active complexes. The stimulation of macrophage TLR4 receptor rapidly activates not only the NF-κB pathway but also MAPK pathways, including JNK, ERK, and p38 (25.Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Many of the downstream targets of MAPK pathways are transcription factors that include c-Jun, ATF2, and Elk-1. It has been reported that AP-1 is important for IL-12/IL-23 p40 gene expression (14.Zhu C. Rao K. Xiong H. Gagnidze K. Li F. Horvath C. Plevy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39372-39382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear how AP-1 controls IL-23 p19 gene expression. We demonstrated that, in contrast to IL-12/IL-23 p40, which is negatively regulated by ERK, the TLR-activated ERK pathway is essential for IL-23 p19 gene expression. We identify an AP-1 element in the IL-23 p19 promoter region and demonstrate, by complementary approaches, that AP-1 is required for IL-23 p19 expression. In addition, we report that interleukin 10 inhibits IL-23 p19 gene expression. The clearer understanding of factors controlling IL-23 expression may assist efforts to control the induction and progression of autoimmune disease. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). TLR4-deficent, MyD88-deficient, and IL-10 deficient mice are maintained in the barrier facility at Mount Sinai School of Medicine according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Wild type, TLR4-deficient, and MyD88-deficient mice were injected intraperitoneal with 2 ml of 5% thioglycollate medium for 3 days and sacrificed, and peritoneal macrophages were isolated by lavage. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were generated from bone marrow stem cells obtained from the femurs of the mice, as described previously (26.Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar). After lysis of the red blood cells, 1 × 106 bone marrow cells were inoculated in each well of 24-well plates with complete DMEM in the presence of GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 7 days. The mouse IL-23 p19 promoter from −1280 to +10 was amplified by PCR using primers with internal XhoI and HindIII restriction sites from C57BL/6 mouse genomic DNA. After sequence verification of the amplified DNA, the PCR product was digested with XhoI and HindIII and cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega). Progressive deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification in the same way. The NF-κB and AP-1 mutant p19 promoter constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's (Stratagene) instructions. Dominant negative c-Jun, ATF2, and ERK2 plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Constantin Bona (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Dominant negative (DN) IκBα (IκBα, A32/36; this IκB mutant is not susceptible to phosphorylation at N-terminal serines 32 and 36, which have been replaced by alanine) and p65−/− cells were kindly provided by Dr. Adrian Ting (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and c-Fos overexpression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Yusaku Nakabeppu. Antibodies for p65, p50, ATF-2, and c-Jun were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for ERK and JNK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody for p19 was purchased from eBioscience. RLM-RACE was employed to determine the transcriptional initiation sites of the mouse p19 gene using an assay kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA treated with LPS at different time points were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The full-length capped mRNA was then treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the 5′ 7-methyl guanine cap of intact, mature mRNA molecules. RNA molecules that had 5′-phosphate groups, including degraded or unprocessed mRNAs lacking a 5′ cap, structural RNAs, and traces of contaminating genomic DNA, were dephosphorylated by calf intestinal phosphatase treatment and were therefore not ligated to the adapter primer sequence. The decapped mRNA was ligated with a 44-base GeneRacer RNA oligonucleotide (5′-cgacuggagcacgaggacacugacauggacugaaggaguagaaa-3′) using T4 RNA ligase. The ligated mRNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III RT and oligo(dT) primer to create RACE-ready first strand cDNA with known priming sites at the 5′-ends. The 5′-end of the p19 gene transcript were amplified using two nested sense primers corresponding to the RNA oligonucleotide sequence and two nested antisense primer specific to p19 mRNA (outer, 5′-tcccgctggtgcatgtgcgttcca-3′; inner, 5′-CTGGCTGGCTCTGTGATCTGCACCA-3′). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min 1 cycle; 94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles; 68 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was size-fractionated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified. The purified PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The transcription start sites of the p19 gene were defined by aligning the 5′-RLM-RACE sequences with the p19 gene sequence. RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). For each transfection, 2.5 μg of plasmid was mixed with 100 μl of DMEM (without serum and antibiotics) and 10 μl of Superfect reagent. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 600 μl of DMEM complete medium was added and immediately placed onto the cells in 6-well plates, and luciferase activity was measured 30 h later. When indicated, different TLR ligands were added to the culture 12 h before harvest. The cells were harvested with reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 μl of extract was assayed for luciferase activity, as described (27.Xiong H. Li H. Kong H.J. Chen Y. Zhao J. Xiong S. Huang B.

Cells were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid to normalize experiments for transfection efficiency. RAW264.7 cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (28.Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). EMSA probes were prepared by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′-ACTG overhangs (MWG Biotechnologies, Inc.) and were labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dGTP and [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. Labeled probes were purified with Nuctrap purification columns (Roche Applied Science). EMSAs were performed as described previously, using 105 cpm of labeled probe and 5 μg of nuclear extracts/reaction. DNA binding complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide-Tris/glycine-EDTA gel, which was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the cDNA was generated with an oligo(dT) primer, followed by analysis using iCycler PCR with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Results were normalized based on the expression of ubiquitin. The IL-23 p19, IL-12 p35, and ubiquitin primer sequences are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used Open table in a new tab IL-23 and IL-12 production in macrophage cell culture was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems). The experiments were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology according to the manufacturer's protocol. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 4 h, fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65, p50, anti-c-Jun, or ATF antibody. The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR with primers spanning the murine IL-23 p19 promoter region. Cell lysates (30 μg of total protein) and prestained molecular weight markers were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (0.5% Triton X-100, Tris-buffered saline), incubated with various antibodies (1:1000) for 2 h, washed with TBST, and stained with peroxidase-conjugated IgG second antibody (1:5000). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). To evaluate the importance of TLR signaling pathways for IL-23 p19 expression, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from wild type (WT), TLR4−/−, and MyD88−/− mice were activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for either 4 h (mRNA) or 24 h (protein). LPS strongly induced IL-23 p19 mRNA expression in macrophages from WT mice, but IL-23 p19 mRNA expression was significantly impaired in macrophages from TLR4−/− and MyD88−/− mice (Fig. 1A), as was LPS-stimulated expression of IL-12 p35 (Fig. 1A). In agreement with the inhibition of IL-23 p19 mRNA, macrophages from TLR4−/− and MyD88−/− mice did not synthesize IL-23 p19 protein (Fig. 1B). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells behaved similarly (Fig. 1C). In addition, IL-23 and IL-12 protein production induced by incubation with LPS plus IFN-γ was significantly reduced in TLR4−/− and MyD88−/− macrophages (Fig. 1D), although LPS itself did not induce detectable amounts of IL-23. Thus, in both macrophages and dendritic cells, LPS-induced IL-23 p19 expression is dependent upon the TLR4-MyD88 pathway. To study transcriptional regulation of the IL-23 p19 gene, we decided to define its promoter region (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) and to map its transcription initiation sites (TIS). Total RNA generated from control and LPS-treated mouse macrophages was used to map the TIS of the p19 gene by 5′-RLM-RACE. In the 25 clones we analyzed, two sequences were identified that differed in the sequence at the 5′-end, which define two TIS in the p19 gene (Fig. 2A). To explore further the regulation of IL-23 p19 expression by the TLR signaling pathway, we cloned 1.3 kb of the IL-23 p19 promoter into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3. To quantify promoter activity of this region, we transfected the p19 promoter luciferase reporter construct into RAW264.7 cells for 18 h and activated the cells with LPS or PGN for 12 h. LPS and PGN induced an approximately 10-fold increase of luciferase activity (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that p19 promoter was within the cloned fragment. Extending the result with LPS stimulation, we found that co-transfection of a constitutively active TLR4 construct also strongly induced p19 promoter activation (Fig. 2C). As a first step toward localizing important control elements within the p19 promoter, a set of 5′ deletion mutants coupled to the luciferase reporter was constructed and analyzed for its effect on luciferase activity. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with the series of deletion mutants, incubated for 18 h, and activated with LPS for 12 h, after which luciferase activity was quantified and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity from a co-transfected control plasmid. Gradual deletion of the sequence from nucleotide −1280 through −413 resulted in minimal changes in promoter activity (Fig. 3). However, complete loss of promoter activity was observed when elements between positions −413 and −168 were deleted (Fig. 3). Thus, the results of deletion analysis of the p19 promoter indicated that sequence from −413 to +10 of the IL-23 p19 promoter was sufficient to confer transcriptional activity. The promoter deletion studies clearly demonstrated the importance of the proximal IL-23 p19 promoter region in macrophages, which is consistent with p19 promoter analysis reported recently. The p19 promoter sequence between −413 and −238 has several putative binding sites for NF-κB, AP-1, and interferon regulatory factor transcription factors. First, we analyzed the contribution of the NF-κB site to the activation of the IL-23 p19 promoter. RAW264.7 cells were activated with LPS, IFN-γ, or IFN-γ and LPS for 4 h, and nuclear protein was extracted for EMSA with a probe spanning nucleotides −228 to −198 of the p19 promoter region. A protein-oligonucleotide complex induced by LPS and unaffected by IFN-γ was observed (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, NF-κB p65, p50, and c-Rel antibodies altered the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that NF-κB subunits bind to the site. To confirm these results, we performed chromatin co-immunoprecipitation experiments. PCR analysis showed that NF-κB p65 antibody precipitated the p19 promoter region (−413 to +10) from RAW264.7 cells activated with LPS for 4 h (Fig. 4C). As would be predicted from the results in Fig. 2, PGN also strongly induced NF-κB·DNA complex formation, whereas poly(I-C) had no clear effect (Fig. 4D). To analyze the functional importance of the NF-κB site, we transfected a p19 promoter luciferase plasmid (−413 to +10) with a mutated NF-κB site into RAW264.7 cells for 18 h, activated with LPS for 12 h, and quantified luciferase activity as before. The p19 promoter with the mutated NF-κB site was not activated under these conditions (Fig. 5A). Thus, in agreement with two recent studies on the p19 promoter NF-κB site, we find that the NF-κB site is essential for IL-23 p19 promoter activation (22.Carmody R.J. Ruan Q. Liou H.C. Chen Y.H. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23.Mise-Omata S. Kuroda E. Niikura J. Yamashita U. Obata Y. Doi T.S. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 6596-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To confirm this result, we co-transfected the p19 promoter and DN IκBα into RAW264.7 cells and activated with LPS. As predicted, we found that DN IκBα significantly inhibited p19 promoter activation (Fig. 5B). In addition, we found that LPS stimulation of the p19 promoter transfected into p65−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts resulted in little p19 promoter activation compared with WT cells (Fig. 5C). These results show that NF-κB is important for p19 promoter activation. ERK MAPK negatively regulates IL-12/IL-23 p40 gene expression (21.Feng G.J. Goodridge H.S. Harnett M.M. Wei X.Q. Nikolaev A.V. Higson A.P. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6403-6412PubMed Google Scholar). To explore whether ERK regulates p19 similarly, we pretreated the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 with the ERK inhibitor UO126 (10 μm) and the inactive analogue UO124 (10 μm) for 30 min, after which the cells were activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 4 h, and total RNA was extracted for qRT-PCR. As reported previously, UO126 treatment significantly enhanced LPS-induced IL-12/IL-23 p40 expression (data not shown). In contrast, UO126 inhibition of ERK activation abolished LPS-induced IL-23 p19 expression (Fig. 6A). Similarly, JNK inhibitor also significantly suppressed p19 mRNA expression (Fig. 6B). In addition, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 significantly reduced p19 mRNA expression (Fig. 6C). Thus, these results show that MAPK activation is important for p19 gene expression. We next explored if the inhibition of p19 mRNA by disruption of ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways was due to inhibition of promoter activity. After transfection of the p19 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid into RAW264.7 cells for 18 h, the cells were activated with LPS in the presence of either ERK inhibitor UO126 (10 μm), JNK inhibitor (10 μm), or p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm) for 12 h. UO126 and JNK inhibitor significantly inhibited p19 promoter activation, whereas their inactive analogues had no effect (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, the p38 inhibitor also significantly suppressed p19 promoter activation (Fig. 6C). To analyze the effect of MAPK inhibitors on IL-23 production, we pretreated thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages with UO126 (10 μm), JNK inhibitor (10 μm), and SB203580 (10 μm) for 30 min, after which the cells were activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) plus IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Supernatants were collected, and IL-23 protein synthesis was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that the MAPK inhibitors blocked IL-23 protein production (Fig. 6D). Western blotting experiments confirm the inhibition of ERK and JNK phosphorylation by their respective inhibitors (Fig. 6E). To confirm this result, RAW264.7 cells were co-transfected with a dominant negative form of Erk2 and a p19 luciferase reporter construct for 18 h, after which the cells were activated with LPS for 12 h prior to determination of luciferase activity. Co-transfection of DN ERK2 significantly inhibited p19 promoter activation (Fig. 6F). Furthermore, when we co-transfected RAW264.7 cells with a p19 luciferase reporter construct and ERK or control siRNA for 18 h, followed by activation with LPS, we found that the ERK siRNA significantly blocked p19 promoter activation induced by LPS (Fig. 6G). In summary, these results show that ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs regulate IL-23 p19 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Since AP-1 family members are often found downstream of the MAPK pathway, we were interested in the function of a potential AP-1 site in the p19 promoter. To determine if this AP-1 site (−199 to −193) is important for p19 promoter activation, we mutated the putative AP-1 site in the p19 promoter region of the luciferase reporter construct. This construct was transfected into RAW264.7 cells for 18 h, and the cells were then activated with LPS for 12 h. We found that the AP-1 mutation abolished p19 promoter activation induced by LPS"
https://openalex.org/W2043028475,"Terminally differentiated neurons are unable to reenter the cell cycle. Aberrant cell cycle activation provokes neuronal cell death, whereas cell cycle inhibition elevates neuronal survival. However, the molecular mechanism regulating the cell cycle and cell death in mature neurons remains elusive. Here we show that SRPK2, a protein kinase specific for the serine/arginine (SR) family of splicing factors, triggers cell cycle progression in neurons and induces apoptosis through regulation of nuclear cyclin D1. Akt phosphorylates SRPK2 on Thr-492 and promotes its nuclear translocation leading to cyclin D1 up-regulation, cell cycle reentry, and neuronal apoptosis. In addition, SRPK2 phosphorylates SC35 and, thus, inactivates p53, resulting in cyclin D1 up-regulation. 14-3-3 binding to SRPK2, regulated by Akt phosphorylation, inhibits these events. We find that SRPK2 is phosphorylated in ischemia-attacked brain, correlating with the observed increase in cyclin D1 levels. Hence, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt mediates the cell cycle and cell death machinery in the nervous system through phosphorylation of SRPK2."
https://openalex.org/W2033369082,"Background The linkages between neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis are well established. What is not, however, is how specific immune pathways and proteins affect the disease. To this end, we previously demonstrated that transgenic over-expression of CCL2 enhanced microgliosis and induced diffuse amyloid plaque deposition in Tg2576 mice. This rodent model of AD expresses a Swedish β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor protein mutant. Methodology/Principal Findings We now report that CCL2 transgene expression accelerates deficits in spatial and working memory and hippocampal synaptic transmission in β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice as early as 2–3 months of age. This is followed by increased numbers of microglia that are seen surrounding Aβ oligomers. CCL2 does not suppress Aβ degradation. Rather, CCL2 and tumor necrosis factor-α directly facilitated Aβ uptake, intracellular Aβ oligomerization, and protein secretion. Conclusions/Significance We posit that CCL2 facilitates Aβ oligomer formation in microglia and propose that such events accelerate memory dysfunction by affecting Aβ seeding in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2020513427,"S-(2-Succinyl)cysteine (2SC) is formed by reaction of the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate with cysteine residues in protein, a process termed succination of protein. Both fumarate and succination of proteins are increased in adipocytes cultured in high glucose medium (Nagai, R., Brock, J. W., Blatnik, M., Baatz, J. E., Bethard, J., Walla, M. D., Thorpe, S. R., Baynes, J. W., and Frizzell, N. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 34219-34228). We show here that succination of protein is also increased in epididymal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous adipose tissue of diabetic (db/db) mice and that adiponectin is a major target for succination in both adipocytes and adipose tissue. Cys-39, which is involved in cross-linking of adiponectin monomers to form trimers, was identified as a key site of succination of adiponectin in adipocytes. 2SC was detected on two of seven monomeric forms of adiponectin immunoprecipitated from adipocytes and epididymal adipose tissue. Based on densitometry, 2SC-adiponectin accounted for approximately 7 and 8% of total intracellular adiponectin in cells and tissue, respectively. 2SC was found only in the intracellular, monomeric forms of adiponectin and was not detectable in polymeric forms of adiponectin in cell culture medium or plasma. We conclude that succination of adiponectin blocks its incorporation into trimeric and higher molecular weight, secreted forms of adiponectin. We propose that succination of proteins is a biomarker of mitochondrial stress and accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates in adipose tissue in diabetes and that succination of adiponectin may contribute to the decrease in plasma adiponectin in diabetes."

Hfq is proposed to be a global post-transcriptional regulator that acts by mediating interactions between many regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) and their mRNA targets. Sequence comparisons revealed that Y. pestis appears to produce a functional homologue of E. coli Hfq.Phenotype comparisons using in vitro assays demonstrated that Y. pestis Hfq was involved in resistance to H(2)O(2), heat and polymyxin B and contributed to growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. The role of Hfq in Y. pestis virulence was also assessed using macrophage and mouse infection models, and the gene expression affected by Hfq was determined using microarray-based transcriptome and real time PCR analysis. The macrophage infection assay showed that the Y. pestis hfq deletion strain did not have any significant difference in its ability to associate with J774A.1 macrophage cells. However, hfq deletion appeared to significantly impair the ability of Y. pestis to resist phagocytosis and survive within macrophages at the initial stage of infection. Furthermore, the hfq deletion strain was highly attenuated in mice after subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Transcriptome analysis supported the results concerning the attenuated phenotype of the hfq mutant and showed that the deletion of the hfq gene resulted in significant alterations in mRNA abundance of 243 genes in more than 13 functional classes, about 23% of which are known or hypothesized to be involved in stress resistance and virulence.Our results indicate that Hfq is a key regulator involved in Y. pestis stress resistance, intracellular survival and pathogenesis. It appears that Hfq acts by controlling the expression of many virulence- and stress-associated genes, probably in conjunction with small noncoding RNAs."

Here, we report that stimulation of endogenous cAMP levels with either forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) or the V2 receptor agonist [deamino-Cys1,d-Arg8]vasopressin increases steady-state surface NKCC2 and that the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 blocks this effect.

Chem. 2003; 278: 26946-26951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These data indicate that enhanced steady-state apical surface NKCC2 levels are involved in the stimulation of NKCC2 activity and NaCl absorption caused by cAMP. However, the signaling cascade involved in the stimulation of NKCC2 trafficking has not been studied in polarized TAL cells. In other epithelial cells, cAMP stimulates protein trafficking by activating protein kinase A (PKA) and/or Epac (guanine exchange protein activated by cAMP) (8Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Ausiello D.A.

PKA is expressed in TALs and binds cAMP in response to arginine vasopressin stimulation (14Gapstur S.M. Homma S. Dousa T.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1988; 255: F292-F300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to PKA, the Epac isoforms Epac1 and Epac2 are expressed in TALs (15Li Y. Konings I.B. Zhao J. Price L.S. de Heer E. Deen P.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F525-F533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but their role in NKCC2 trafficking has not been addressed. In the collecting duct epithelium, arginine vasopressin and cAMP stimulate aquaporin-2 exocytic insertion into the apical membrane and enhance water permeability (16Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D.

However, Epac-selective agonists also enhance aquaporin-2 trafficking and apical exocytosis in this renal epithelium, suggesting a role for Epac1 (10Yip K.P. Am. J. Physiol.

In addition, in other cells, Epac-dependent signaling exerts opposite effects compared with PKA (22Mei F.C. Qiao J. Tsygankova O.M. Meinkoth J.L. Quilliam L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol.

We hypothesized that cAMP increases steady-state surface NKCC2 expression in native TALs by stimulating apical exocytosis and that PKA mediates this process. Our data show for the first time that cAMP stimulates the rate of NKCC2 exocytosis via PKA and that this trafficking step mediates the increase in steady-state surface NKCC2 in native TALs. Reagents for steady-state surface biotinylation and exocytic insertion protocols were from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). PKA- and Epac-selective agonists were from Biolog/Axxora (Bremen, Germany), and H-89 was obtained from EMD Chemicals (San Diego, CA) or LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). All fluorescent reagents, including FM1–43 and Alexa Fluor-labeled antibodies, were from Invitrogen. All other reagents were from Sigma. Kidneys were obtained from 250–300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as described (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The outer medulla was dissected, minced, and digested in collagenase in buffer A (130 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, 4.0 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 6 mm l-alanine, 1.0 mm disodium citrate, 5.5 mm glucose, 2.0 mm calcium lactate, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) to obtain TAL suspensions. Biotinylation of TAL surface NKCC2 was performed as described in detail previously (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Ares G.R. Caceres P. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F877-F887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TALs were equilibrated at 37 °C for 15 min and then treated with vehicle or corresponding drug for 30 min. In some experiments, H-89 was present during the equilibration period. TALs were biotinylated at 4 °C with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin; 0.9 mg/ml); washed; and lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors. Biotinylated proteins were separated with streptavidin-coated beads overnight at 4 °C and recovered by boiling in Laemmli loading buffer containing dithiothreitol and β-MeEtOH. Proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and NKCC2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were detected by Western blotting. Control experiments showed the absence of biotinylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the surface fraction, no change in total NKCC2 with various treatments (see Fig. 1A), linear recovery of biotinylated NKCC2, complete extraction of biotinylated proteins from beads, and a linear range of surface NKCC2 signal in films. NKCC2 was detected with chicken anti-rat NKCC2 antibody (1:1400; raised against an N-terminal sequence of rat NKCC2) (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was detected with monoclonal antibodies from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Bands were detected by chemiluminescence and quantified. Surface proteins accessible to NHS-SS-biotin in TAL suspensions were first masked by reaction with membrane-impermeant NHS-acetate as described previously for other membrane proteins (25Peng Y. Amemiya M. Yang X. Fan L. Moe O.W. Yin H. Preisig P.A. Yanagisawa M. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F34-F42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lee-Kwon W. Kawano K. Choi J.W. Kim J.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16494-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, TALs were incubated with NHS-acetate (2 mg/ml in buffer A, pH 7.8) at 4 °C for 1 h, adding fresh NHS-acetate every 15 min. The drugs for treatment were added at 4 °C, and samples were warmed to 37 °C. Exocytosed NKCC2 was chased for 15, 30, and 45 min. TALs were then cooled, and newly inserted NKCC2 was biotinylated with NHS-SS-biotin. The efficiency of NHS-acetate masking for NKCC2 was calculated in every experiment from the difference between a TAL aliquot that was not masked with NHS-acetate (100% basal surface NKCC2) and an aliquot that was masked at 4 °C but never warmed to 37 °C (0 time point). The difference between these two samples represents the NHS-acetate-masked surface NKCC2 fraction, which was used to express exocytic insertion over time. NHS-acetate consistently masked 80% of surface NKCC2 accessible for biotinylation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120–150 g were used for TAL perfusion as described previously (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Ares G.R. Caceres P. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F877-F887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Apical NKCC2 was measured after labeling NKCC2 in intact microperfused TALs with a rabbit antibody against a predicted extracellular epitope (4Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17713-17722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of rat NKCC2 (e-NKCC2) as described (24Ares G.R. Caceres P. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F877-F887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After treatment of perfused TALs with vehicle or drugs in the absence or presence of H-89 (10 μm) at 37 °C, protein trafficking was stopped by cooling TAL cells to 4 °C, and apical membranes were labeled with anti-e-NKCC2 antibody (1:100 in 2.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6) added to the lumen perfusate for 30 min at 4 °C. The lumen was washed, and TALs were fixed while at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin, followed by 20 min of apical labeling with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG highly cross-adsorbed at 1:200 in 2.5% bovine serum albumin. Undetectable labeling was observed in the absence of primary e-NKCC2 antiserum (data not shown). The e-NKCC2 antiserum was characterized previously in isolated perfused rat TALs (24Ares G.R. Caceres P. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F877-F887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscopy system (Visitech International) with acousto-optical tunable filter-controlled argon laser (488 nm line) excitation. Fluorescence was measured with a 500-nm long-pass filter. Identical settings were used to obtain cross-section z-series images from individual TAL cells along a tubule. To diminish day-to-day variation, fluorescence intensity was regularly calibrated to a linear range using FocalCheck slides. Two-dimensional image analysis was used to measure fluorescence intensity in regions of interest encompassing the apical membrane of several cells in each image. Mean fluorescence intensity was obtained for at least 14 cells/TAL tubule and averaged. Apical exocytosis in microperfused TALs was monitored by measuring FM1–43 fluorescence of apical membranes as described previously for renal collecting ducts (10Yip K.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 291: F882-F890Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Yip K.P. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). FM1–43 fluoresces when bound to membranes but not in aqueous solution and is impermeable to cell membranes. Thus, its intensity is directly related to membrane surface area and is used as an index of cumulative exocytosis (27Smith C.B. Betz W.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μm FM1–43 was included in the luminal perfusate and exchanged for 30 s before imaging. FM1–43 was present in the flowing apical solution for the remainder of the experiment. Images were acquired via laser scanning confocal microscopy at a cross-section of labeled TALs along the z axis so that the apical membranes of TAL cells were in focus on both sides of the lumen. FM1–43 was excited with an acousto-optical tunable filter-controlled argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was collected with a 525-nm long-pass emission filter. Images were acquired for 100 ms, every 10 s. After a 10-min period with continuous FM1–43 perfusion, the dye was washed out from the lumen. We observed little endocytosis of FM1–43 prior to 10 min; however, subapical vesicles were visible after 10 min of incubation with the dye (data not shown). Regions of interest were generated encompassing the apical and subapical spaces in each TAL image (generally four cells at each side of the tubule wall). Mean fluorescence intensity was obtained for six to eight cells/tubule and averaged. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences between means in different treatment groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. In TALs, cAMP stimulates NKCC2-dependent NaCl reabsorption by increasing steady-state surface NKCC2 (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but the signaling cascade mediating this effect is not clear. We first tested whether cAMP-induced stimulation of surface NKCC2 is mediated by PKA. We used forskolin (20 μm), an adenylyl cyclase agonist, plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 0.5 mm), a general phosphodiesterase inhibitor, to increase intracellular cAMP. We found that incubating TALs for 30 min with forskolin/IBMX increased steady-state surface NKCC2 by 81 ± 16% (p < 0.05). Preincubation of TALs with the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10 μm) blocked 70% of the forskolin/IBMX effect, which only weakly stimulated surface NKCC2 (p < 0.05 versus forskolin/IBMX) (Fig. 1, A and B). In control experiments, we found no change in surface NKCC2 when TALs were incubated with either IBMX (14 ± 8%) or H-89 alone (7 ± 8%) (data not shown). To increase cAMP levels with a physiological agonist, we used the vasopressin V2 receptor agonist dDAVP. We observed that a 30-min incubation with 1 μm dDAVP increased surface NKCC2 by 23 ± 9% (p < 0.05). Phosphodiesterase inhibition with IBMX enhanced the effect of dDAVP, which stimulated surface NKCC2 by 44 ± 11% (p < 0.05). However, in TALs preincubated with H-89, the effect of dDAVP + IBMX was completely blocked (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that PKA mediates the stimulatory effect of cAMP on steady-state surface NKCC2. To directly image the effect of cAMP on apical membrane NKCC2 levels, we used immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy in perfused TALs. To detect surface NKCC2 in the apical membrane but not in the intracellular pool, we labeled the apical side of intact TALs with an antibody against an extracellular NKCC2 sequence located between the TM5 and TM6 domains facing the apical side, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control TALs incubated with vehicle, we found the expected NKCC2 labeling along the apical surface of all TAL cells (Fig. 2A). In TALs treated with forskolin/IBMX for 30 min, apical NKCC2 labeling was increased by 75% (from 151 ± 10 to 263 ± 15 fluorescence units, p < 0.01). However, in TALs preincubated with H-89, forskolin/IBMX (30 min) did not change apical NKCC2 labeling (139 ± 9 versus 142 ± 7 fluorescence units, not significant) (Fig. 2B). These data confirm the surface biotinylation results showing that PKA is essential for cAMP-stimulated apical NKCC2 trafficking in native TALs. To differentiate the role of PKA from the possible upstream or downstream actions of Epac, we studied the effect of a PKA-selective agonist and an Epac-selective agonist on steady-state surface NKCC2. A 30-min incubation of TALs with the PKA-selective agonist N6-benzoyl-cAMP (0.5 and 1 mm) increased surface NKCC2 by 55 ± 26 and 95 ± 26%, respectively (p < 0.05), and this effect was largely abrogated in the presence of H-89 (Fig. 3). To selectively stimulate Epac signaling, we used the agonist 8-p-chlorophenylthio-2′-O-methyl-cAMP at two concentrations (100 and 250 μm). We found that a 30-min incubation with the Epac analog had no effect on surface NKCC2 levels in TALs (Fig. 3). These data suggest that PKA is the primary cAMP target mediating the stimulatory effect on NKCC2 trafficking. The trafficking step affected by cAMP and the kinetics of NKCC2 trafficking have not been studied. NKCC2 is located in the apical membrane and subapical vesicles of TALs. To study whether cAMP stimulates apical membrane exocytosis in TALs, we monitored the effect of forskolin/IBMX on FM1–43 fluorescence in the apical membrane of microperfused TALs. FM1–43 is a styryl dye that is impermeable to cell membranes and fluoresces when bound to membranes but not in aqueous solution. Thus, its intensity is directly related to membrane surface area and is used as an index of cumulative exocytosis (27Smith C.B. Betz W.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 29Gaffield M.A. Betz W.J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2916-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). TALs were perfused with luminal solution containing FM1–43 (2 μm) for 10 min, and then the luminal solution was exchanged to wash out the dye from apical membranes. Confocal images were acquired every 10 s and later analyzed to quantify apical membrane FM1–43 intensity over time in TALs treated with vehicle (basal) or forskolin/IBMX. Under basal conditions, apical FM1–43 intensity was stable and did not increase over time for a period of 10 min (Fig. 4). After washout of FM1–43 from the TAL lumen, fluorescence intensity was almost completely eliminated, indicating that little FM1–43 was internalized via endocytosis. In TALs treated with forskolin/IBMX, we observed a rapid increase in FM1–43 fluorescence intensity after 2 min (22 ± 6%, p < 0.01), followed by a sustained increase with a maximal difference of 47 ± 7% (p < 0.001) by 7 min (Fig. 4B). Incubation times longer than 10 min resulted in internalization of the dye and were not studied (data not shown). These data indicate that cAMP stimulates apical exocytosis in native TALs. We next studied the effect of cAMP on exocytic insertion of NKCC2 in TALs. For this, we used a modified surface biotinylation protocol (25Peng Y. Amemiya M. Yang X. Fan L. Moe O.W. Yin H. Preisig P.A. Yanagisawa M. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F34-F42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lee-Kwon W. Kawano K. Choi J.W. Kim J.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16494-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to measure exocytic insertion of NKCC2 after masking accessible biotinylation sites with NHS-SS-acetate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” First, we observed constitutive NKCC2 exocytosis under basal conditions during a time course of 45 min (Fig. 5, A and B). Control experiments showed that NHS-acetate masked surface NKCC2 biotinylation by 80% (see “Experimental Procedures” for a detailed description). In paired experiments, we treated TALs with either vehicle or forskolin/IBMX and measured NKCC2 insertion after 15, 30, or 45 min. We observed that the rate of NKCC2 exocytosis was enhanced by 3-fold at 15 min, 2.8-fold at 30 min, and 2.5-fold at 45 min (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5C). These data show for the first time that cAMP stimulates the rate of NKCC2 exocytic insertion in epithelial cells. PKA inhibition prevented most of the cAMP-induced increase in steady-state surface NKCC2 (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2). If exocytic insertion is the primary trafficking step required to enhance surface NKCC2, then PKA inhibition should block exocytosis. To test this, we incubated TALs with H-89 in the absence and presence of forskolin/IBMX and then measured NKCC2 exocytic insertion for 30 min. Forskolin/IBMX stimulated NKCC2 exocytic insertion compared with vehicle-treated TALs (p < 0.05), and H-89 blocked the stimulatory effect of forskolin/IBMX by almost 60% (p < 0.02) (Fig. 6). Interestingly, constitutive NKCC2 insertion was not affected by PKA inhibition. These data indicate that PKA is involved in cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytosis but not in constitutive NKCC2 insertion into the apical membrane. We found previously that cAMP stimulates NaCl absorption by TAL by increasing surface NKCC2 levels (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the trafficking steps and the signaling cascade by which cAMP increases apical NKCC2 in epithelial cells were unknown. Here, we observed that PKA inhibition blocks cAMP-induced increases in steady-state surface NKCC2 when cAMP is increased by either forskolin/IBMX or the physiological agonist dDAVP in native TAL epithelium (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.). Consistent with a role of PKA, a PKA-selective agonist stimulated surface NKCC2 to similar levels compared with forskolin/IBMX, whereas the Epac-selective agonist 8-p-chlorophenylthio-2′-O-methyl-cAMP had no effect on surface NKCC2 (Fig. 3). The absence of an effect of the Epac analog may indicate that Epac is not involved in the stimulation of surface NKCC2 or that the concentration of agonist was not sufficient to stimulate Epac activity. However, the latter is unlikely because the concentration of Epac agonist used was higher than those reported to activate Epac in renal tubules (10Yip K.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 291: F882-F890Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Honegger K.J. Capuano P. Winter C. Bacic D. Stange G. Wagner C.A. Biber J. Murer H. Hernando N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, we observed that during PKA inhibition with H-89, the Epac-selective agonist decreased surface NKCC2 by 20% (data not shown), suggesting an inhibitory role of Epac in NKCC2 trafficking to the membrane that may be masked by low PKA activation. Together, our data indicate that PKA mediates cAMP-induced stimulation of steady-state apical surface NKCC2 in TALs. The concentration of H-89 used here has been extensively validated for PKA inhibition (20Hoffert J.D. Fenton R.A. Moeller H.B. Simons B. Tchapyjnikov D. McDill B.W. Yu M.J. Pisitkun T. Chen F.

In our experiments, 10 μm H-89 blocked 70–100% of the forskolin/IBMX effect in steady-state apical NKCC2 (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.). However, we observed only a partial blockade of cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytosis (Fig. 6). We think that this is due to differences in the incubation time with H-89 in the two protocols. In the exocytic insertion protocol, TALs were warmed in the presence of both H-89 and forskolin/IBMX, whereas for steady-state surface NKCC2 measurements, the PKA inhibitor was preincubated with H-89 before increasing cAMP. It is possible that this shortens the time required for H-89 to maximally inhibit PKA. Alternatively, it is possible that a fraction of cAMP-stimulated exocytic insertion is mediated by a different cAMP-stimulated pathway. We also observed constitutive NKCC2 insertion under basal conditions (Fig. 5), suggesting that trafficking of NKCC2 to the apical membrane is a continuous dynamic process rather than an event triggered by cAMP. It is likely that constitutive endocytosis and recycling are involved in maintaining steady-state NKCC2 at the apical membrane. However, these processes appear not to be dependent on PKA activity because H-89 did not affect steady-state surface NKCC2 (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.) or the rate of exocytic insertion (Fig. 6). Although our data indicate that cAMP stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis, they do not exclude the possibility that cAMP affects endocytosis and recycling of NKCC2 and that these mechanisms also contribute to enhance apical membrane NKCC2 levels. The protein targets by which PKA stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis are not known. Our previous data indicate that the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family of proteins is involved in NKCC2 trafficking because the stimulation of surface NKCC2 by cAMP was blocked by tetanus toxin (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This neurotoxin blocks vesicle fusion by cleaving the SNARE proteins VAMP-2 and VAMP-3, both of which are expressed and co-localize with NKCC2 in TALs (6Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol.

Thus, we speculate that PKA stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis by SNARE-dependent fusion and trafficking to the apical membrane of TALs. In addition to SNARE protein phosphorylation, rat NKCC2 possesses three predicted serine phosphorylation sites in its C terminus (4Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S.

Although phosphorylation at these sites has not been described, N-terminal threonine phosphorylation is associated with enhanced activity (38Ponce-Coria J. San-Cristobal P. Kahle K.T. Vazquez N.

https://openalex.org/W2090184061,"Despite significant improvements in life expectancy of kidney transplant patients due to advances in surgery and immunosuppression, Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN) remains a daunting problem. A complex network of cellular mechanisms in both graft and peripheral immune compartments complicates the non-invasive diagnosis of CAN, which still requires biopsy histology. This is compounded by non-immunological factors contributing to graft injury. There is a pressing need to identify and validate minimally invasive biomarkers for CAN to serve as early predictors of graft loss and as metrics for managing long-term immunosuppression.We used DNA microarrays, tandem mass spectroscopy proteomics and bioinformatics to identify genomic and proteomic markers of mild and moderate/severe CAN in peripheral blood of two distinct cohorts (n = 77 total) of kidney transplant patients with biopsy-documented histology.Gene expression profiles reveal over 2400 genes for mild CAN, and over 700 for moderate/severe CAN. A consensus analysis reveals 393 (mild) and 63 (moderate/severe) final candidates as CAN markers with predictive accuracy of 80% (mild) and 92% (moderate/severe). Proteomic profiles show over 500 candidates each, for both stages of CAN including 302 proteins unique to mild and 509 unique to moderate/severe CAN.This study identifies several unique signatures of transcript and protein biomarkers with high predictive accuracies for mild and moderate/severe CAN, the most common cause of late allograft failure. These biomarkers are the necessary first step to a proteogenomic classification of CAN based on peripheral blood profiling and will be the targets of a prospective clinical validation study."

We provide evidence that Type I IFNs regulate expression of Schlafens (SLFNs), a group of genes involved in the control of cell cycle progression and growth inhibitory responses. Using cells with targeted disruption of different STAT proteins and/or the p38 MAP kinase, we demonstrate that the IFN-dependent expression of distinct Schlafen genes is differentially regulated by STAT complexes and the p38 MAP kinase pathway. We also provide evidence for a key functional role of a member of the SLFN family, SLFN2, in the induction of the growth-suppressive effects of IFNs. This is shown in studies demonstrating that knockdown of SLFN2 enhances hematopoietic progenitor colony formation and reverses the growth-suppressive effects of IFNα on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Importantly, NIH3T3 or L929 cells with stable knockdown of SLFN2 form more colonies in soft agar, implicating this protein in the regulation of anchorage-independent growth.

The potent antitumor properties of Type I IFNs have prompted extensive efforts over the years to understand the mechanisms by which these cytokines generate signals and induce biological responses. Key events elicited during engagement of the Type I IFN-receptor have been identified, and major signaling cascades that are activated in an IFN-dependent manner have been defined. The Jak-STAT pathway is the most important pathway in the regulation of IFN-inducible gene transcription and probably the best studied and characterized IFNα-regulated signaling pathway to date (reviewed in Refs. 2Stark G.R.

A remaining challenge in the IFN signaling field is the identification of specific genes or groups of genes that specifically account for the induction of the diverse biological responses of IFNs. Various proteins that are involved in the generation of the antiviral effects of IFNs have been identified over the years (19Sadler A.J. Williams B.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). However, very little is known on ISG products that participate in the generation of IFN-dependent antiproliferative responses. In fact, the key IFN-inducible gene products that mediate growth inhibitory responses in different cell types remain largely unknown.The Schlafen (SLFN) (from the German word schlafen or sleeping) family of proteins includes several members that have previously been shown to control cell cycle progression and growth arrest (20Schwarz D.A.

Although limited studies have been conducted on the roles of distinct Schlafen group members on the regulation of cellular functions, there is emerging evidence indicating a potentially important role for these proteins in the control of cell cycle progression. Regardless, very little is known on the potential involvement of SLFN genes and their products in the induction of antiproliferative responses induced by IFNs or other growth-suppressive cytokines.In the present study we examined the induction of expression of various mouse SLFN family members during treatment of sensitive cells with IFNα. Our data demonstrate that SLFN1 and SLFN2 (group I), SLFN3 (group II), as well as SLFN5 and SLFN8 (group III) are all genes inducible by treatment of sensitive cells with mouse IFNα. Using defined knock-out cells for different STAT proteins and/or the p38 MAP kinase, we provide evidence for differential regulation of distinct SLFN members by different STAT complexes and the p38 MAP kinase. In other studies we provide evidence that knockdown of SLFN2 enhances murine hematopoietic progenitor colony formation and reverses the growth-suppressive effects of IFNα and IFNγ on normal hematopoiesis. In addition, our data show that NIH3T3 and L929 fibroblast cells with stable knockdown of SLFN2 form more colonies in soft agar compared with control cells, implicating this member of the SLFN family of proteins in the regulation of anchorage-independent growth. Altogether, our results indicate that SLFN2 acts as a negative regulator of the metastatic and growth potential of malignant cells, and it is an effector element in the generation of Type I IFN-induced antiproliferative responses.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells Lines and AntibodiesNIH3T3 and L929 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics.

The siRNA transfection reagent TransIT-TKO was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mirus Bio Corporation, Madison, WI). For the generation of stable SLFN2 knockdown NIH3T3 and L929 cells, a commercially available system from Clontech was used. Briefly, SLFN2 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA and control scrambled sequences were used as templates in the Clontech shRNA sequence designer tool for Clontech pSIREN vectors. Plasmids were sequenced to verify the presence of siRNA encoding insert and then used for retroviral infection of NIH3T3 and L929 cells. Infected pSIREN-shRNA expressing cells were green fluorescent and were selected by flow cytometry.Cell Proliferation AssaysCell proliferation assays using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide method were performed as in our previous studies (35Kannan-Thulasiraman P.

Colony formation assays were performed using Sca1+ cells isolated from mouse bone marrow stem cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (MACS kit, Miltenyi Biotec Inc., CA). The cells were plated in methocult methylcellulose media (Stemcell Technologies, Seattle, WA) in the presence or absence of 103 IU/ml IFNα, and colony formation was assessed after 7 days of culture. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed in soft agar assays in duplicate, carried out essentially as previously described (38Hamburger A.W. Salmon S.E. Science. 1977; 197: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in 0.3% top agar over a bottom layer of 0.5% agar in 6-well plates. The solidified soft agar was overlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The medium was changed every 4–5 days. The colonies were scored after 11 days (NIH3T3 cells) or 8 days (L929 cells) of culture.mRNA Isolation and Real Time PCR Probes and PrimersCells were treated with 5 × 103 IU/ml of IFNα for the indicated times. Isolation, purification of mRNA, and conversion into cDNA was performed using the respective kits and oligo(dT)s from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Validated, inventoried probes and primers for real time PCR and TaqMan PCR master mix were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The probes and primers were: SLFN1, Mm00488306_m1; SLFN2, Mm 00488307_m1; SLFN3, Mm00488309_g1; SLFN5, Mm00806095_m1; SLFN8, Mm00824405_m1; and ISG15, Mm01705338_s1. GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1) was used as an internal control.RESULTSIn initial studies we determined whether treatment of cells with IFNα induces expression of different SLFN genes. NIH3T3 cells were treated with mouse IFNα for different times, and the induction of mRNA expression for key members of the SLFN gene family was determined. As shown in Fig. 1, mRNA expression for different SLFN genes was inducible at various degrees in response to IFNα treatment. The most pronounced induction was for SLFN1 (Fig. 1A), followed by SLFN5, SLFN2, and SLFN8 (Fig. 1, B, D, and E). SLFN3 was induced clearly to a lesser degree than other SLFNs (∼4-fold), but its induction was consistently seen (Fig. 1C).To better understand the regulation of SLFN proteins during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor, we generated and used an anti-SLFN2 antibody to directly examine the expression of SLFN2 protein after IFNα treatment of cells. This antibody was custom-generated via a commercial vendor against a conserved region in the N terminus of the protein and detects a single band at ∼44 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of SLFN2. As shown in Fig. 1F, base-line expression of SLFN2 in NIH3T3 cells was clearly detectable, but treatment of cells with IFNα resulted in up-regulation of the expression of the protein (Fig. 1F). We also examined the subcellular localization of the protein. In a previous study, it was shown that overexpressed FLAG-tagged SLFN2 in HEK-293T cells is exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm (25Neumann B. Zhao L. Murphy K. Gonda T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, FLAG tagging could theoretically interfere with the structural properties and localization of the protein, and the potential translocation of endogenous SLFN2 in response to cytokine treatment has not been known. In studies in which the localization of the endogenous protein was directly determined using the newly generated anti-SLFN2 antibody, we found that endogenous SLFN2 is exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm, and IFNα treatment does not induce its translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 1G).IFNα binding to the type I IFN receptor results in activation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 transcription factors, which form various homo- and/or heterodimers that can bind specific sequences in the promoters of IFN inducible genes (2Stark G.R.

To define the roles of distinct STAT proteins and the p38 MAPK in SLFN gene expression, experiments were performed using cells with targeted disruption of STAT1, STAT3, or p38α genes. In initial studies, STAT1−/− MEFs and STAT1+/+ parental MEFs were treated with mouse IFNα, and mRNA expression for SLFN1, SLFN2, SLFN3, SLFN5, and SLFN8 was determined. IFNα-dependent expression of all SLFN genes was decreased in STAT1 knock-out MEFs compared with parental MEFs, and the effect ranged from a partial impairment (SLFN3) to completely defective transcription (SLFN1, 2, 5, and 8) (Fig. 2). Similarly, IFNα-inducible SLFN expression was examined in STAT3 knock-out MEF cells. The induction of expression of SLFN1, SLFN2, SLFN3, and SLFN8 genes was decreased in STAT3 knock-out cells although not abrogated (Fig. 3, A–C). The expression of SLFN5 was completely STAT3-independent, and in fact, SLFN5 expression was enhanced in STAT3 knock-out cells (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 2.Differential requirement for STAT1 in IFNα-inducible expression of distinct SLFN mRNAs.

IFNα-dependent mRNA expression for SLFN1, SLFN2, and, to a lesser degree, SLFN3 was suppressed in the absence of p38α MAPK (Fig. 4, A–C). On the other hand, the group III schlafen genes, SLFN5 and SLFN8, were induced by IFNα in a p38α MAPK-independent manner (Fig. 4, D and E), suggesting that p38 activity is essential for IFN-dependent expression of group I and II but not group III Schlafen genes.FIGURE 4.Role of p38α MAPK in the regulation of expression of SLFN genes. p38α+/+ and p38α−/− MEFs were treated with IFNα for the indicated times.

Vascular smooth muscle is an important source of ET-1. Here we demonstrate synergistic induction of preproET-1 message RNA and release of mature peptide by a combination of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon γ (IFNγ) in primary human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. This induction was prevented by pretreatment with the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor anacardic acid. TNFα induced a rapid and prolonged pattern of nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 subunit activation and binding to the native preproET-1 promoter. In contrast, IFNγ induced a delayed activation of interferon regulatory factor-1 without any effect on NF-κB p65 nuclear localization or consensus DNA binding. However, we found cooperative p65 binding and histone H4 acetylation at distinct κB sites in the preproET-1 promoter after stimulation with both TNFα and IFNγ. This was associated with enhanced recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the ATG start site and read-through of the ET-1 coding region. Understanding such mechanisms is crucial in determining the key control points in ET-1 release. This has particular relevance to developing novel treatments targeted at the inflammatory component of pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Understanding such mechanisms is crucial in determining the key control points in ET-1 release. This has particular relevance to developing novel treatments targeted at the inflammatory component of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid peptide which is known to be both a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogen for vascular smooth muscle (1.Bobik A. Grooms A. Millar J.A. Mitchell A. Grinpukel S. Am. J.

As such it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular disease and is particularly associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (3.Stewart D.J. Levy R.D. Cernacek P. Langleben D. Ann.

In many cell types cytokines mediate their biological effects at least in part by the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway (16.Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar), and a role for NF-κB in pulmonary arterial hypertension has been proposed (17.Aziz S.M. Toborek M. Hennig B. Endean E. Lipke D.W. Cell Biol. Int. 1997; 21: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown previously that a combination of TNFα and interferon γ (IFNγ) stimulates human pulmonary artery smooth muscle (HPASM) cells to release ET-1 (18.Wort S.J. Woods M. Warner T.D. Evans T.W. Mitchell J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. The preproET-1 promoter region has been shown experimentally to possess binding sites for nuclear factor (NF)-1 and phorbol ester-sensitive c-Fos and c-Jun complexes (19.Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acute phase reactant regulatory proteins, and binding sites for AP-1 and GATA-2 (20.Dorfman D.M. Wilson D.B. Bruns G.A.

In addition, binding sites for interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and NF-κB are predicted by Transfac analysis (23.Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhäuser R. Prüss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The close proximity of the IRF-1 site and one of the NF-κB sites is characteristic of genes that are regulated by the synergistic action of TNFα and IFNγ, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (24.Tau G. Rothman P. Allergy. 1999; 54: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25.Paludan S.R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), although ET-1 has not previously been recognized in this group. Our aims were, therefore, to investigate the role of NF-κB in ET-1 release by primary HPASM cells. In addition, we were interested in the role of histone acetylation in the epigenetic control of the ET-1 production. Understanding these novel mechanisms will allow a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling in pulmonary vessels and aid in the development of new treatment strategies aimed at blocking synthesis of ET-1. Human pulmonary arteries from healthy segments of lung were obtained from patients undergoing pulmonary resection at the Royal Brompton Hospital. Vessels were dissected clean from adventitia under sterile conditions, and the endothelium was removed mechanically, cut into 3–4-mm2 sections, and cultured as previously described (6.Wort S.J. Mitchell J.A. Woods M. Evans T.W. Warner T.D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S410-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells between passages 2 and 9 were either seeded onto 96-well plates or tissue culture flasks. Cells were grown to 80% confluence (10,000 cells/well), serum-deprived for 24 h (0.1% BSA) before treatment with either the same medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and/or combinations of TNFα and IFNγ (both at 10 ng/ml), for another 24 h. ET-1 or Big ET-1 in the supernatant was measured by ELISA (R&D systems, Abingdon, UK and Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). Total cellular RNA was extracted as previously described (27.Ito K. Jazrawi E.

Stained cells were observed by confocal microscopy, and images were collected using Leica confocal analysis software (TCSNT). Nuclear extracts were prepared exactly as previously described (27.Ito K.

Protein expression in nuclear extracts was determined by Western blot analysis (27.Ito K. Jazrawi E. Cosio B. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. J. Biol.

NF-κB p65 DNA binding in nuclear extracts was determined using an ELISA-based kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (TransAm, Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). Binding of p65 (sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IRF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and RNA polymerase II (ab5408, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to the native preproET-1 promoter and changes in histone acetylation status (06-866, anti-pan acetylated H4 antibody, Upstate, Watford, UK) were measured by ChIP assay exactly as previously described (27.Ito K.

Primer details are shown in Table 1. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, onessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. TNFα and IFNγ were obtained from R&D systems. The IκB kinase 2 (IKK-2) inhibitor AS602868 was kindly provided by Dr. Michel Dreano (Serono, Basel, Switzerland). The histone acetyltransferase inhibitor anacardic acid was obtained from Calbiochem. All primers for PCR were constructed by Invitrogen. All data are reported as the means ± S.E. from n experiments unless stated otherwise. Statistical analysis was made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-test analysis or by one-sample t test. p values ≤0.05 were considered significant. Under basal conditions HPASM cells released 9.8 pg/ml ET-1 into the supernatant after 24 h. Neither TNFα (10 ng/ml) nor INFγ (10 ng/ml) alone significantly increased ET-1 release, confirming our previous data (18.Wort S.J. Woods M. Warner T.D. Evans T.W. Mitchell J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, when TNFα and INFγ were added together, a synergistic induction of ET-1 production was observed (29.2 versus 9.8 pg/ml p < 0.05, Fig. 1A). In addition, neither lipopolysaccharide nor IL-1β had any significant effect on ET-1 release. The addition of the endothelin converting enzyme inhibitor phosphoramidon (50 μm) dramatically reduced ET-1 release with consequent increases in big ET-1 levels (Figs. 1, B and C, respectively), suggesting de novo protein production. The synergistic effects of TNFα and INFγ were apparent at all concentrations of cytokine tested (Fig. 1, D and E) and reached a plateau at 1–10 ng/ml TNFα and IFNγ. These effects were also seen at the mRNA level. 18 h after stimulation there was a clear synergistic increase in preproET-1 mRNA with both cytokines together compared with either cytokine alone (Fig. 1F, all at 10 ng/ml). Previous studies from our group have suggested that the cytokine-driven increase in preproET-1 mRNA levels in systemic vascular smooth muscle are unlikely to be because of changes in mRNA stability (7.Woods M. Wood E.G. Bardswell S.C. Bishop-Bailey D. Barker S. Wort S.J. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The IKK2 inhibitor AS602868 blocked the ability of TNFα and IFNγ to induce ET-1 expression in these cells in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting basal release (Fig. 2A). This implicates NF-κB as a critical factor in the synergistic induction of ET-1. To further explore the apparent synergy at the level of transcription, we examined nuclear enrichment of NF-κB p65, IRF-1, and phospho-STAT-1. TNFα plus INFγ induced p65 nuclear translocation, which was detectable between 0.5 and 6 h, with a peak signal at 1–2 h (Fig. 2B). In separate studies we found that the IFNγ-regulated transcription factors, IRF-1 and STAT-1, also translocate to the nucleus after treatment of HPASM cells with TNFα and IFNγ (Fig. 2B). As predicted, levels of STAT-1 peaked earlier than those of IRF-1 (data not shown), as STAT-1 is known to regulate IRF-1 production (29.Pine R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similarly, by confocal microscopy, p65, which was almost exclusively located in the cytosol of untreated cells that had been serum-deprived for 24 h, appeared enriched in the nucleus of cells stimulated with TNFα plus INFγ (Fig. 2C). Because no STAT binding sites are present in the preproET-1 promoter, we focused hereafter on IRF-1 interactions with NF-κB. In separate experiments the effect of TNFα and IFNγ on p65 and IRF-1 nuclear translocation was investigated 2 h post-stimulation. This time point was chosen as this represented the time when there was maximum overlap of nuclear enrichment of p65 and IRF-1. There was no enhanced nuclear import of either p65 or IRF-1 as measured by Western blotting. Interestingly, although IFNγ alone had no effect on nuclear translocation of p65, TNFα caused a small but significant nuclear enrichment of IRF-1 (Fig. 2D). This was confirmed with confocal microscopy (data not shown). Furthermore, TNFα alone significantly enhanced NF-κB p65 DNA binding to a consensus κB element, whereas treatment with IFNγ alone did not enhance NF-κB p65 DNA binding (Fig. 2E). Although cotreatment of HPASMs with TNFα and IFNγ appeared to result in less NF-κB p65 DNA binding to the consensus κB site, this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2E). Finally, we demonstrated that the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor anacardic acid suppressed TNFα/IFNγ-stimulated ET-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2F), highlighting a key role for histone acetylation in ET-1 induction in these cells. ChIP assays were used to determine that binding of p65 to putative NF-κB sites on the native preproET-1 promoter. Using the Transfac MatInspector V2.2 program (23.Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) we were able to identify six possible NF-κB binding sites in the preproET-1 promoter region (Fig. 3A). Of these, two have previously been reported as active sites for NF-κB binding, −2093 bp (30.Quehenberger P. Bierhaus A. Fasching P. Muellner C. Klevesath M. Hong M. Stier G. Sattler M. Schleicher E. Speiser W. Nawroth P.P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (Region B) and −891 bp (31.Fujita M. Shannon J.M. Irvin C.G. Fagan K.A. Cool C. Augustin A. Mason R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L39-L49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Region A), using reporter gene assays. Enhanced binding of p65 at regions A and C was observed at 2 h after treatment of cells with both cytokines compared with that seen with either cytokine alone (Fig. 3B). Although there was enhanced p65 DNA binding with TNFα alone in region B compared with IFNγ alone or control, there was no additional enhancement of binding in the presence of both cytokines. There was no evidence of p65 promoter binding under any condition compared with control in regions A′ and D. Interestingly, treatment of cells with TNFα alone resulted in p65 association with the IRF-1 site (Region E), although there was no additional binding after co-stimulation with IFNγ. Treatment of primary HPASM cells with a combination of TNFα and IFNγ (both at 10 ng/ml) for 2 h resulted in increased acetylation of histone H4 at the κB sites positioned at Region A (−891 bp) and Region C (−2424 bp), compared with that seen with either cytokine alone (Fig. 4). The largest increase in histone H4 acetylation was seen at region B (−2093 bp) after TNFα stimulation. However, this was not further enhanced by the addition of IFNγ. In contrast, there was no H4 acetylation seen at Region A′ (−1214 bp) or Region D (−2819 and −2916 bp). These results were consistent, therefore, with the p65 ChIP experiments. They indicate that although sites within regions A, B, and C all bind p65 and are associated with histone H4 acetylation after TNFα stimulation, only regions A and C demonstrated enhanced binding with the addition of both TNFα and IFNγ. In contrast, regions A′ and D were not acetylated under these conditions despite containing putative NF-κB binding sites reflecting the lack of p65 binding. Although there was evidence of increased acetylation at the IRF-1 site at 2355 bp (Region E) compared with control, there was no difference between cytokine treatments. Interestingly, there was a clear difference between the results for histone acetylation at the NF-κB sites at Region C (−2424 bp) and the IRF-1 site at Region E (−2355 bp), surprisingly distinguishing between binding sites less than 100 bp apart after enzymatic digestion of DNA. RNA Pol II binding at κB sites in region C and B but not D and A′ was enhanced, consistent with the results for p65 and acetylated histone H4 ChIP experiments. Interestingly in region A, treatment with IFNγ alone enhanced RNA Pol II binding to a greater extent than that seen with TNFα with no additional recruitment seen in the presence of both cytokines. Finally, at the IRF-1 site (region E) there was greatest relative enhancement of RNA Pol II binding after co-stimulation compared with the effect of either cytokine alone, confirming the importance of this site in transcriptional control of ET-1 under these conditions (Fig. 5). Furthermore, RNA Pol II was only recruited to the preproET-1 start site when both cytokines are present, and this coincided with active transcription as measured by RNA Pol II read-through of preproET-1 (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Synergistic association of RNA pol II to the ET-1 start site and coding region. HPASM cells were cultured with the cytokines TNFα and IFNγ either alone or in combination (all at 10 ng/ml) for 2 h. ChIP was performed using an antibody directed against RNA Pol II. Real time PCR was performed using primers covering the ATG start site and a mid coding region. Ct (threshold) values of PCR products were normalized to those of input samples.

The role of cytokines in stimulating vascular smooth muscle cells to produce mitogens such as ET-1 is poorly understood. We demonstrate that enhanced histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II recruitment occurs at selective NF-κB sites in the preproET-1 promoter after cooperative p65 recruitment to these sites in the native promoter and that this is associated with enhanced gene transcription. Furthermore, we show that an additional level of control occurs at the post-transcriptional level in these cells. In endothelial cells, which were originally considered to be the main source of ET-1 in the vasculature, TNFα, IL-1β, or lipopolysaccharide alone and in combination stimulate ET-1 release and increased expression of preproET-1 mRNA (32.Marsden P.A. Brenner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C854-C861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Yoshizumi M. Kurihara H. Morita T. Yamashita T. Oh-hashi Y. Sugiyama T. Takaku F. Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. Yazaki Y.

By contrast, in vascular smooth muscle cells, we have previously shown that the preproET-1 mRNA induced by TNFα and IFNγ is both slow and sustained (18.Wort S.J. Woods M. Warner T.D. Evans T.W. Mitchell J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These differences in ET-1 release may be indicative of the physiological versus pathophysiological role of each cell type. The observation of a dependence on two cytokines for the increased transcription of a gene has previously been described in immune cells (25.Paludan S.R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the synergistic action of TNFα and IFNγ is well described and includes control of genes such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IL-6, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (36.Jahnke A. Johnson J.P. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37.Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J.

Physiol. 2002; 283: L1280-L1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study we extend this regulation for the first time to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, this synergistic control of the preproET-1 mRNA expression is a novel observation. As in immune cells, this type of regulation may be seen as a protective function in pulmonary artery smooth muscle, only allowing synthesis of ET-1 under severe stress or with multiple inflammatory hits. Thereby this observation has important implications for vascular remodeling, where the role of inflammation is being increasingly recognized (5.Wort S.J. Woods M. Warner T.D. Evans T.W. Mitchell J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Where TNFα and INFγ act in synergy to induce genes, the TNFα-associated transcription factor is invariably NF-κB (25.Paludan S.R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Indeed, we were able to demonstrate that inhibition of IKK2 by AS602868 was able to attenuate TNFα/IFNγ-induced ET-1 expression in these cells. IFNγ-induced transcription factors include IRF-1 as well as STAT-1 and AP-1 (41.Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Stimulation of HPASM cells with TNFα and IFNγ was associated with p65 nuclear translocation; however, there was no increase in nuclear translocation when the cytokines were combined, and we demonstrated similar findings with IRF-1. In addition, we observed an increase in nuclear enrichment with IRF-1 when HPASM cells were treated with TNFα alone. Stimulation of IRF-1 synthesis by TNFα has been shown previously (29.Pine R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, treatment of HPASM cells with TNF-α alone is still insufficient for preproET-1 gene transcription, suggesting that the amount of IRF-1 induced by TNFα is insufficient to enable formation of a pre-initiation complex and subsequent ET-1 transcription. Alternatively, other transcription factors such as AP-1 may play a predominant role. We were unable to demonstrate a STAT-1 binding site in the preproET-1 promoter region, which limits the potential role for this transcription factor in interacting with p65 and precluded further investigation. Further experiments will need to be performed to investigate the importance of the AP-1 site at −108 bp and the effect of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibition. Using immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and DNA binding assays, we were unable to show enhanced p65 activation in the presence of IFNγ. In fact, there appeared to be a decrease in consensus p65 binding in the presence of TNFα and IFNγ. This observation has been reported before in relation to the regulation of IL-6, IL-8, and eotaxin (42.Keslacy S. Tliba O. Baidouri H. Amrani Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although this may explain regulation of genes inhibited by the combination of TNFα and IFNγ, it clearly does not explain the situation where there is a synergistic increase in gene regulation such as for inducible nitric-oxide synthase and IL-6. Furthermore, within the situation of total cell reduction in p65 binding and histone acetylation, there was clearly no loss of p65 binding and indeed enhanced histone acetylation and RNA Pol II binding to specific κB sites in the preproET-1 promoter. Using p65 ChIP analysis we were able to show that in the presence of TNFα and IFNγ there was selective recruitment to specific κB sites in the native preproET-1 promoter. We could show that three of the five regions (containing six κB sites) investigated were active. Furthermore, there was clearly enhanced binding at regions A (−891bp) and C (−1214 bp) with both cytokines but not at region B (−2093 bp), where there was no increase compared with TNFα alone. We were also able to show tethering of p65 at the IRF-1 binding site in the ET-1 promoter in the presence of TNFα alone but no enhanced binding with the addition of IFNγ. Therefore, our results extend those of Quehenberger et al. (30.Quehenberger P. Bierhaus A. Fasching P. Muellner C. Klevesath M. Hong M. Stier G. Sattler M. Schleicher E. Speiser W. Nawroth P.P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), who detected increased binding using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a specific probe for the −2093 binding site for p65 (corresponding to our region B) in bovine endothelial cells. In fact, although we also show p65 binding to this site in Region B, we also reveal the potentially more important sites in Regions A and C with regard to enhancement of ET-1 transcription in the presence of TNFα and IFNγ. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of this powerful technique in primary human vascular smooth muscle cells and the first to describe direct interactions of p65 with the native preproET-1 promoter. To further investigate potential mechanisms, we examined the effect of TNFα and IFNγ alone and in combination on histone H4 acetylation at the relevant sites within the native ET-1 promoter. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic control mechanism involved in the regulation of gene transcription (44.Adcock I.M. Ford P. Ito K. Barnes P.J. Respir. Res. 2006; 7: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate enhanced histone H4 acetylation at distinct NF-κB sites in the preproET-1 promoter region under conditions of TNFα and IFNγ stimulation compared with the cytokines alone. In agreement with the p65 ChIP binding data, most histone acetylation was associated with regions A, B, and C, suggesting that these are the most transcriptionally active NF-κB binding sites. However, as with the p65 ChIP data, it was only at the sites in Regions A and C where enhanced histone H4 acetylation with both cytokines was demonstrated. Histone H4 acetylation was increased in all conditions at the IRF-1 site compared with control, but there was no difference between these conditions, unlike at the NF-κB sites. Surprisingly, the resolution of the ChIP assay here using enzymatic digested DNA was such that it could distinguish between an active and inactive site (Region C and E), less than 100 bp apart. Finally, the importance of histone acetylation was confirmed by the action of the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor anacardic acid. RNA Pol II ChIP confirmed the importance of the NF-κB sites in regions B and C and confirmed the redundancy of the sites in regions A′ and D. The greatest relative increase in binding occurred at the IRF-1 binding site, indicating its importance in transcription. The most unexpected result was at the NF-κB binding site in region A. Here, we found that IFNγ alone resulted in most RNA Pol II association. However, taken together, these ChIP experiments confirm a complex interaction of key NF-κB sites together with a single IRF-1 site in close proximity. This may reflect the formation of an enhanceosome (in the presence of both cytokines) which allows RNA Pol II to bind to the ATG start site and drive active preproET-1 transcription as demonstrated by RNA Pol II association with the preproET-1 coding region. This would need to be confirmed using addition experiments including chromosome conformation capture analysis to demonstrate looping out at the ET-1 locus. Alternatively, as the RNA Pol II antibody used measures both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, we could merely be reflecting localization of distinct hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms at distinct sites performing separate functions. The unphosphorylated form of RNA Pol II binds to the pre-initiation complex through interaction with the general transcription factor TBP and the Mediator complex. This complex tethers RNA Pol II to the TGFβ1 promoter and integrates the signals from p65 and IRF-1 to the general transcription machinery (45.Egloff S. Murphy S. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Subsequent RNA Pol II Ser-5 phosphorylation then allows release from the Mediator complex and transcription to start as demonstrated by the read-through of the coding sequence. Further temporal analysis of phosphorylated forms of RNA Pol II across the TGFβ1 promoter and coding sequence may resolve this. There are several limitations to this study. First, the ChIP studies in particular involved small n numbers (n = 3–4). However, we chose to study only primary human cells from the pulmonary vasculature of patients, making the results more meaningful. We were not able to reproduce the synergy in ET-1 release or p65 DNA binding with TNFα and IFNγ in a commercially available human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell line (CC-2581, Lonza), which also limited the potential to perform further mechanistic studies. The number of cells available was, therefore, limited, especially for techniques such as ChIP, which demand large numbers of cells. In addition, the use of limited numbers of primary cells prevented the optimization of the time course for histone acetylation at the ET-1 promoter. Initial studies in cells from a single patient demonstrate that enhanced p65 binding occurs at the NF-κB-A site at 1 h post-stimulation before measurable pan H4 acetylation (data not shown). Second, studying individual patients inevitably will lead to individual variations, and we believe that is why the error margins are quite large in some of the experiments. It is possible that other IFNγ regulated transcription factors/sites are important such as AP-1, but these were not studied here. The formation of enhanceosomes has been demonstrated elegantly for virus-induced IFN-β expression and is essential for maximal and sustained transcription but needs to be formally demonstrated here (46.Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Further experiments including optimization of the time-course for chromatin modification and remodeling events may provide further information underlying the synergistic transcription of ET-1. Understanding basic mechanisms of induction of genes such as ET-1 are crucial to elucidating the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling. In particular, the development of assays such as the ChIP assay allows the study of native transcriptional control not only in human cells but also in a tissue-specific manner. This model may allow the development of therapeutic strategies that are themselves tissue-specific, such as NF-κB inhibition (47.Karin M. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2005; 2: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or by the use of sequence-specific artificial zinc finger proteins (48.Negi S. Imanishi M. Matsumoto M. Sugiura Y. Chemistry. 2008; 14: 3236-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to target vascular smooth muscle. Indeed, methods directed at transcription factors, such as antisense oligonucleotides against NF-κB, have already been shown to be of therapeutic benefit in vascular disease (40.Sawa Y. Morishita R. Suzuki K. Kagisaki K. Kaneda Y. Maeda K. Kadoba K. Matsuda H. Circulation. 1997; 96: 280-284Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2172036368,"Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its analogue exendin-4 (Ex-4) enhance glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and activate various signaling pathways in pancreatic beta-cells, in particular cAMP, Ca(2+) and protein kinase-B (PKB/Akt). In many cells these signals activate intermediary metabolism. However, it is not clear whether the acute amplification of GSIS by GLP-1 involves in part metabolic alterations and the production of metabolic coupling factors.GLP-1 or Ex-4 at high glucose caused release (approximately 20%) of the total rat islet insulin content over 1 h. While both GLP-1 and Ex-4 markedly potentiated GSIS in isolated rat and mouse islets, neither had an effect on beta-cell fuel and energy metabolism over a 5 min to 3 h time period. GLP-1 activated PKB without changing glucose usage and oxidation, fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis or esterification into various lipids in rat islets. Ex-4 caused a rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and cAMP but did not enhance energy utilization, as neither oxygen consumption nor mitochondrial ATP levels were altered.The results indicate that GLP-1 barely affects beta-cell intermediary metabolism and that metabolic signaling does not significantly contribute to GLP-1 potentiation of GSIS. The data also indicate that insulin secretion is a minor energy consuming process in the beta-cell, and that the beta-cell is different from most cell types in that its metabolic activation appears to be primarily governed by a ""push"" (fuel substrate driven) process, rather than a ""pull"" mechanism secondary to enhanced insulin release as well as to Ca(2+), cAMP and PKB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2160318110,"NDRG4 is a largely unstudied member of the predominantly tumor suppressive N-Myc downstream-regulated gene (NDRG) family. Unlike its family members NDRG1–3, which are ubiquitously expressed, NDRG4 is expressed almost exclusively in the heart and brain. Given this tissue-specific expression pattern and the established tumor suppressive roles of the NDRG family in regulating cellular proliferation, we investigated the cellular and biochemical functions of NDRG4 in the context of astrocytes and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. We show that, in contrast to NDRG2, NDRG4 expression is elevated in GBM and NDRG4 is required for the viability of primary astrocytes, established GBM cell lines, and both CD133+ (cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched) and CD133− primary GBM xenograft cells. While NDRG4 overexpression has no effect on cell viability, NDRG4 knockdown causes G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. The initial G1 arrest is associated with a decrease in cyclin D1 expression and an increase in p27Kip1 expression, and the subsequent apoptosis is associated with a decrease in the expression of XIAP and survivin. As a result of these effects on cell cycle progression and survival, NDRG4 knockdown decreases the tumorigenic capacity of established GBM cell lines and GBM CSC-enriched cells that have been implanted intracranially into immunocompromised mice.

N-Myc downstream-regulated gene immunohistochemical glioblastoma multiforme cancer stem cell. In contrast to its subfamily member NDRG2, NDRG4 has not been studied in GBM cells or astrocytes. Nevertheless, available evidence supports the hypothesis that NDRG4 has an important role in this context that is similar to the role of NDRG2. First, unlike the relatively ubiquitous expression patterns of NDRG1–3, NDRG4 expression is restricted to a small number of tissues including the brain, where it is expressed at particularly high levels (7Qu X. Zhai Y. Wei H. Zhang C. Xing G. Yu Y. He F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 229: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Zhou R.H. Kokame K. Tsukamoto Y. Yutani C. Kato H. Miyata T. Genomics. 2001; 73: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This restricted expression pattern suggests that NDRG4 plays an important role within the central nervous system. Second, NDRG4 is more than 60% identical in amino acid sequence to NDRG2. This sequence similarity is likely behind the overlapping functions of these two proteins in certain cell types within the brain. For example, in PC12 neuronal cells, both NDRG4 and NDRG2 promote neurite extension (16Hongo S. Watanabe T. Takahashi K. Miyazaki A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Ohki T. Hongo S. Nakada N. Maeda A. Takeda M. Brain Res. Dev.

Lett. 2005; 388: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In combination with the brain-specific expression pattern of NDRG4, these functional and sequence similarities suggest that NDRG4 may recapitulate the tumor suppressive function of NDRG2 in primary brain neoplasms. To determine if the similarities between NDRG2 and NDRG4 extend to the context of GBM, we investigated the role of NDRG4 in GBM cell lines and primary human astrocytes. In contrast to the established roles of NDRG2 and other NDRG family members, we found that the role of NDRG4 in GBM is not tumor suppressive. On the contrary, both astrocytes and GBM cells require the presence of NDRG4 for cell cycle progression and survival. pLKO.1 lentiviral nontargeting shRNA clone, NDRG1 targeting shRNA clone (sh-NDRG1-a: NM_006096.2–779s1c1), and NDRG4 targeting shRNA clones (sh-NDRG4-a: NM_020465.1–640s1c1; sh-NDRG4-b: NM_020465.1–769s1c1) were purchased from Sigma. pGIPZ lentiviral nontargeting shRNA clone and NDRG2 targeting shRNA clones (sh-NDRG2-a: RHS4430–99149037; sh-NDRG2-b: RHS4430–98851006) were purchased from Open Biosystems. pBabe-NDRG2 was generated by PCR amplification of NDRG2 from pCMV-HA-hNDRG2 (generously donated by Libo Yao and co-workers (15Deng Y. Yao L. Chau L. Ng S.S. Peng Y. Liu X. Au W.S. Wang J. Li F. Ji S. Han H. Nie X. Li Q. Kung H.F. Leung S.Y. Lin M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)) and subcloning into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBabe-puro. NDRG4 overexpression constructs were generated by PCR amplification of NDRG4(B) and NDRG4(H) from brain cDNA and subcloning into the BamHI site of pBabe-puro. Overexpression retrovirus was produced in 293T cells by co-transfection of pBabe constructs with the pCL10A-1 packaging vector. Knockdown lentivirus was produced in 293T cells by co-transfection with the psPAX2 and pVSVG packaging vectors. For both, medium was replenished 24 h after transfection, and virus was collected 48 h later. Supernatant was filtered, mixed with 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and added to target cells. For all experiments, cells were infected with virus for 48 h and selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 72 h unless otherwise indicated. Matched subpopulations of CD133+ cells (enriched for GBM CSCs) and CD133− cells (nonstem cells) were isolated from human GBM xenografts or primary GBM tumors as previously described (19Bao S. Wu Q. Sathornsumetee S. Hao Y. Li Z. Hjelmeland A.B. Shi Q. McLendon R.E. Bigner D.D. Rich J.N. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7843-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). GBM CSCs (CD133+) were cultured in Neurobasal Medium without Phenol Red (Invitrogen) containing the following additives: B-27 supplement without vitamin A (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen), GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), MEM nonessential amino acids solution (Invitrogen), and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). GBM nonstem cells (CD133−) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Normal primary human astrocytes were purchased from Lonza and cultured in the medium provided in the Astrocyte Medium BulletKit (CC-3186). All other GBM cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. mRNA was isolated with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), and results were normalized to β-2-microglobulin (B2M) levels. The following primers were used: NDRG4-F: GGAGGTTGTCTCTTTGGTCAAGGT, NDRG4-R: CTCATGACAGCAGCCACCAGAAT, B2M-F: GAGGTTTGAAGATGCCGCATT, B2M-R: TGTGGAGCAACCTGCTCAGATA. Following infection and selection, 1,000 CD133+ GBM CSCs or 300,000 U251 cells were implanted into the right frontal lobes of 5-week-old, male, athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice under a Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol. Mice were maintained for 6 months or until the development of neurological symptoms of functional impairment that significantly impaired their quality of life (ataxia, lethargy, seizures, and inability to feed). Because prior xenograft studies have demonstrated that these signs develop shortly before animal death, mice were euthanized at this point. Brains of euthanized mice were collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. H&E staining and Ki-67 staining were performed by the Duke Pathology Research Histology Laboratory. The logrank test was used for statistical analysis. Following infection and selection, the following numbers of cells per well were plated: 1,000 cells in 96-well plates (cell viability), 200,000 cells in 24-well plates (annexin V), and 5,000 cells in 96-well plates (caspase 3/7 activity). Assays were then carried out with the following kits: CellTiter® 96 AQueous Nonradioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences), and Apo-ONE Homogenous Caspase-3/7 Assay (Promega). Following infection and selection, spheres of CD133+ GBM CSCs were dissociated, and varying densities of cells were plated in 24-well plates. The percentage of wells with neurosphere formation and the average number of neurospheres per well were measured at the indicated times. Prior to flow cytometry analysis, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and then resuspended in 500 μl phosphate-buffered saline, 50 μl of PI (1 mg/ml), and 10 μl of RNase (20 mg/ml). For synchronization experiments, cells were first treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h. Cells were then washed, infected with knockdown lentivirus for 9 h, and treated with 2 mm thymidine again for 14 h before release. For spindle checkpoint experiments, cells were infected with knockdown lentivirus for 24 h and then treated for 48 h with 100 ng/ml nocodazole. Nucleocytoplasmic fractionation was performed as described previously (20Jian H. Shen X. Liu I. Semenov M. He X. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For all other experiments, cells were lysed in ULB as described previously (21Waddell D.S. Liberati N.T. Guo X. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29236-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Western analysis was performed using the following antibodies: phosphohistone H3-Ser-10 (Upstate, 06–570), γ-tubulin (Sigma, T6557), NDRG4 (Sigma, HPA015313), NDRG1 (Sigma, HPA006881), NDRG2 (Sigma, HPA002896), XIAP (Cell Signaling, 2045), caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, 9662), caspase-9 (Cell Signaling, 9508), cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling, 2926), cyclin E (Cell Signaling, 4129), Smad1 (Abcam, ab33902), α-tubulin (Abcam, ab6160), p27Kip1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-528), and lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7293). Freshly frozen human glioma surgical resection samples from the Brain Tumor Center Tissue Bank at Duke University were processed, and 10 micron sections were mounted on glass slides in accordance with the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Staining was then performed based on the protocol provided with R.T.U. VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Reagent (Vector Laboratories). Background Buster (Innovex Biosciences) was used for 30 min, NDRG4 antibody (1:25 dilution; Sigma, HPA015313) and biotinylated secondary antibody (10 μg/ml, Vector Laboratories) were used for 1 h each, and the Liquid DAB/Substrate System (Innovex Biosciences) was used for 3 min. Ki-67 staining was performed by the Duke Pathology Research Histology Laboratory. Cells were infected with knockdown or control lentivirus for 48 h, and comet assays were performed as described previously (22Wakeman T.P. Kim W.J. Callens S. Chiu A. Brown K.D. Xu B. Mutat. Res. 2004; 554: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To understand the role of NDRG4 in astrocytes and GBM cells and to determine the functional similarities and differences between NDRG4 and NDRG2, we began by studying NDRG4 expression in human tumor samples. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of normal human cortex and GBM samples revealed increased NDRG4 protein expression in GBM (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Both normal samples tested had undetectable levels of NDRG4, but five out of six GBM samples showed a subset of neoplastic cells with moderate to high intensity cytoplasmic staining (supplemental Fig. S1). In the sample with the greatest degree of positivity, ∼10–15% of cells showed strong staining for NDRG4 (Fig. 1A). This finding is in contrast to the reported lower expression level of NDRG2 in neoplastic glioma cells relative to normal nonneoplastic glial cells, an observation fitting with the presumed role of NDRG2 as a tumor suppressor in this context (11Berglund L. Björling E. Oksvold P. Fagerberg L. Asplund A. Al-Khalili Szigyarto C. Persson A. Ottosson J. Wernérus H. Nilsson P. Lundberg E. Sivertsson A. Navani S. Wester K. Kampf C. Hober S. Pontén F. Uhlén M.

Cancer. 2008; 123: 2080-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our IHC analysis observations are further supported by an independent antibody-based proteomic analysis that showed increased NDRG4 expression in human glioma samples compared with nonneoplastic cortical brain tissue (11Berglund L. Björling E. Oksvold P. Fagerberg L. Asplund A. Al-Khalili Szigyarto C. Persson A. Ottosson J. Wernérus H. Nilsson P. Lundberg E. Sivertsson A. Navani S. Wester K. Kampf C. Hober S. Pontén F. Uhlén M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 2019-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a second NDRG4 antibody used in this independent IHC analysis of normal human tissues and cancer tissues yielded staining patterns similar to the those produced by the antibody used in Fig. 1A (11Berglund L. Björling E. Oksvold P. Fagerberg L. Asplund A. Al-Khalili Szigyarto C. Persson A. Ottosson J. Wernérus H. Nilsson P. Lundberg E. Sivertsson A. Navani S. Wester K. Kampf C. Hober S. Pontén F. Uhlén M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 2019-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), suggesting that the staining pattern we observed is specifically due to increased NDRG4 expression. However, to confirm the increased expression of NDRG4 in GBM, we next examined NDRG4 mRNA levels in normal primary human astrocytes and cells derived from human GBM xenografts. Using primers specifically targeting an RNA sequence common to all known isoforms of NDRG4, we measured NDRG4 mRNA levels by real-time RT-PCR analysis in two independent lots of primary astrocytes and in cultured cells derived from three different GBM xenografts. Consistent with our IHC results, we found that NDRG4 expression was 5–20-fold higher in cultured GBM xenograft cells than in normal astrocytes (Fig. 1B). Given that GBM tumors contain heterogeneous subpopulations of cells, we next tested whether the subset of cells showing strong NDRG4 staining represented the highly tumorigenic GBM CSC population. To test this, we examined the relative expression level of NDRG4 in cultured GBM CSC-enriched populations (CD133+) and corresponding nonstem cell populations (CD133−) directly derived from GBM xenograft samples. The expression between these cell populations was similar (Fig. 1B). Thus, NDRG4 expression in GBM cells is not CSC-restricted. Neoplastic GBM cells that were positive for NDRG4 expression by IHC analysis appeared to show strong cytoplasmic NDRG4 staining (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1), which is consistent with what has been reported in other cell types and in other species (2Nakada N. Hongo S. Ohki T. Maeda A. Takeda M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2002; 135: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 3Nishimoto S. Tawara J. Toyoda H. Kitamura K. Komurasaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2521-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To confirm this localization in GBM cells and to further characterize the expression pattern of NDRG4, we determined its subcellular localization in U251 GBM cells by fractionation and Western analysis. Similar to what we observed through IHC analysis, NDRG4 localized to the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, it remained cytoplasmic even upon treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B. To begin to understand the biological functions of NDRG4, we next partially synchronized U251 cells with a double thymidine block and measured NDRG4 expression during different stages of the cell cycle. We found that NDRG4 levels fluctuate during cell cycle progression. At 9–12 h after release from the block, when the highest percentage of G2/M cells was observed (∼50%), NDRG4 mRNA levels were lowest (Fig. 1D). In contrast, NDRG4 mRNA levels peaked at 0–3 h and 18–24 h after release, and NDRG4 protein expression peaked slightly later in an expression pattern opposing that of the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3. These time points correlate with progression through G1 phase and entry and progression through S phase. This is supported by our IHC analysis, which showed that similar percentages of GBM cells stain positive for NDRG4 and the proliferation marker Ki-67 (∼10–15% and 15–20%, respectively; Fig. 1A, supplemental Fig. S1, and supplemental Fig. S2). It is also consistent with our observation that NDRG4 mRNA levels decrease with passage number in primary human astrocytes as they stop growing: NDRG4 expression levels at passage 7 were only 20% of what they were at passage 1 (supplemental Fig. S3), presumably due to a decreased percentage of astrocytes progressing through the G1/S transition. A similar decrease in NDRG2 expression was observed with increasing passage. Taken together, these results prompted the additional comparative studies of NDRG2 and NDRG4 described below and indicated that NDRG4 is expressed in a cell cycle-specific manner that implicates it in cell cycle progression. To test the hypothesis that NDRG4 is involved in GBM cell cycle progression, we knocked down NDRG4 expression with two lentiviral shRNA constructs (sh-NDRG4-a and sh-NDRG4-b) that target different regions of the NDRG4 transcript, and we then assessed cell viability by MTS assay in the resulting knockdown cell lines. Knockdown of NDRG4 expression in U251 GBM cells dramatically decreased their viability (Fig. 2A). The magnitude of the reduction in viability was proportional to the efficacy of the two shRNA constructs: sh-NDRG4-a reduced NDRG4 expression and cell viability by ∼60%, whereas sh-NDRG4-b reduced each by ∼95%. These dose-dependent effects strongly suggest that the decreased viability we observed was a specific effect caused by loss of NDRG4 expression. This is further supported by our finding that cell viability was unaffected by control, nontargeting shRNAs (Fig. 2A). Similarly, shRNAs that target NDRG2 did not affect cell viability despite reducing NDRG2 protein levels by more than 90% (Fig. 2B). Moreover, NDRG1 and NDRG2 levels were not affected by NDRG4 knockdown (supplemental Fig. S4), further indicating that the effects on cell viability were specifically due to NDRG4 knockdown. To determine if the decreased cell viability caused by NDRG4 knockdown is a robust response, we next knocked down NDRG4 expression in several additional GBM cell lines as well as primary astrocytes, the presumed cell of origination for GBM. In every GBM cell line tested, NDRG4 knockdown reduced cell viability by 40–99% (supplemental Fig. S5). Moreover, the NDRG4 knockdown-induced decrease in viability was not restricted to transformed or neoplastic cells, as 90–95% knockdown of NDRG4 decreased the viability of primary astrocytes by 60% (Fig. 2C). Thus, the reduction in cell viability caused by NDRG4 knockdown is a robust response that is not unique to the U251 cell line model system. This robust requirement for the presence of NDRG4 is in contrast to the function of NDRG2 in GBM cells. While NDRG4 expression is essential for U251 cell viability (Fig. 2A), reduction of NDRG2 expression by ∼95% did not affect the viability of U251 cells (Fig. 2B). Severalfold overexpression of NDRG2, however, reduced U251 cell viability by 30% at day 4 (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with previous findings from NDRG2 overexpression studies in U373 GBM cells (15Deng Y. Yao L. Chau L. Ng S.S. Peng Y. Liu X. Au W.S. Wang J. Li F. Ji S. Han H. Nie X. Li Q. Kung H.F. Leung S.Y. Lin M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, severalfold overexpression of two NDRG4 isoforms that have been demonstrated to be expressed in the brain, NDRG4(B) and NDRG4(H), did not affect U251 cell viability (Fig. 3B). Thus, despite the strong similarity between NDRG2 and NDRG4 in sequence and in function in other cell types, our results indicate that these two genes have divergent functions in GBM cells. Loss of cell viability as determined by MTS assay can have multiple etiologies including reduced metabolic activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. To differentiate between the possible etiologies, we knocked down NDRG4 expression in U251 cells that had been partially synchronized in early S phase by a double thymidine block, and we then measured the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle after release. While control cells completed two cell cycles in a 36 h time window, cells with reduced NDRG4 expression completed the first cycle but stopped cycling in the G1 phase of the second cycle (Fig. 4A). This indicated that NDRG4 is required for progression through G1. To further confirm this, we did cell cycle analysis over an NDRG4 knockdown time course. A comparison of U251 cells at day 1 and day 1.5 after infection with sh-NDRG4-b knockdown virus revealed an increase in the percentage of cells in G1 at day 1.5 (from 69 to 84%) and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2/M (from 30 to 15%; Fig. 4B). Moreover, we detected a number of NDRG4 knockdown-induced molecular events associated with the regulation of G1 phase progression: p27Kip1 levels increased and cyclin D1 levels decreased starting at day 1 after infection with the sh-NDRG4-b knockdown virus (Fig. 4C). NDRG4 knockdown-induced G1 arrest was followed by several apoptotic events. The initial accumulation of cells in G1 that was first observed at day 1.5 after infection with sh-NDRG4-b knockdown virus was followed by a slight decrease in the G1 population of cells at day 4 (92% at day 3.5 and 85% at day 4; Fig. 4B). This corresponded with an increase in the sub-G0/G1 population (2% at day 3.5 and 9% at day 4), which is suggestive of increased apoptosis. In support of this, NDRG4 knockdown caused a 5-fold increase over control in the percentage of annexin V-positive cells at day 5 (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, a number of molecular events associated with apoptosis were observed in NDRG4 knockdown cells but not control cells: XIAP and survivin levels decreased starting at day 2 after infection with sh-NDRG4-b virus, and this was followed by an increase in caspase cleavage at day 3 (Fig. 4E). The elevation in caspase activity was confirmed by fluorescent caspase 3/7 activity assays, which revealed an 11-fold increase in caspase activity in response to knockdown with the sh-NDRG4-b virus (Fig. 4F). The sh-NDRG4-a construct produced similar, although attenuated, effects consistent with its less pronounced effect on NDRG4 expression. During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, safeguards exist to ensure that genomic DNA is intact and ready for replication. Consequently, progression through G1 can be stopped by factors that cause a loss of genomic DNA integrity due to improper mitosis. Because another NDRG family member, NDRG1, is required for correct mitotic spindle formation and progression through mitosis in mammary epithelial cells (23Kim K.T. Ongusaha P.P. Hong Y.K. Kurdistani S.K. Nakamura M. Lu K.P. Lee S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38597-38602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we next used a mitotic checkpoint assay to investigate whether NDRG4 functions in an analogous manner in GBM cells. Treatment of control cells with nocodazole, a chemotherapeutic inhibitor of microtubule formation that interferes with the formation of the mitotic spindle, resulted in an increased polyploid population of cells manifesting as 4N and 8N cells (46 and 16% of cells, respectively, as compared with 10 and 1% of untreated cells; Fig. 5B). The presence of polyploidy rather than mitotic arrest is likely due to the mutated TP53 gene present in U251 cells. As expected, NDRG1 knockdown exacerbated the detrimental effect of nocodazole. The combined result of nocodazole treatment and a loss of NDRG1 was a dramatic increase in apoptosis manifesting as a large sub-G0/G1 population of cells (31% of cells as compared with 12% in the control nocodazole-treated population; Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, NDRG4 knockdown in combination with nocodazole treatment did not cause pronounced apoptos"
https://openalex.org/W2083197833,"Precise regulation of Wnt signaling is important in many contexts, as in development of the vertebrate forebrain, where excessive or ectopic Wnt signaling leads to severe brain defects. Mutation of the widely expressed oto gene causes loss of the anterior forebrain during mouse embryogenesis. Here we report that oto is the mouse ortholog of the gpi deacylase gene pgap1, and that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident Oto protein has a novel and deacylase-independent function during Wnt maturation. Oto increases the hydrophobicities of Wnt3a and Wnt1 by promoting the addition of glycophosphatidylinositol (gpi)-like anchors to these Wnts, which results in their retention in the ER. We also report that oto-deficient embryos exhibit prematurely robust Wnt activity in the Wnt1 domain of the early neural plate. We examine the effect of low oto expression on Wnt1 in vitro by knocking down endogenous oto expression in 293 and M14 melanoma cells using shRNA. Knockdown of oto results in increased Wnt1 secretion which is correlated with greatly enhanced canonical Wnt activity. These data indicate that oto deficiency increases Wnt signaling in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we address the mechanism of Oto-mediated Wnt retention under oto-abundant conditions, by cotransfecting Wnt1 with gpi-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD). The presence of GPI-PLD in the secretory pathway results in increased secretion of soluble Wnt1, suggesting that the gpi-like anchor lipids on Wnt1 mediate its retention in the ER. These data now provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the forebrain defects in oto mice, and support a role for Oto-mediated Wnt regulation during early brain development. Our work highlights a critical role for ER retention in regulating Wnt signaling in the mouse embryo, and gives insight into the notoriously inefficient secretion of Wnts."
https://openalex.org/W2052270196,"Many species introduced by humans for social and economic benefits have invaded new ranges by escaping from captivity. Such invasive species can negatively affect biodiversity and economies. Understanding the factors that relate to the establishment of feral populations of introduced species is therefore of great importance for managing introduced species. The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is one species that has escaped from farms, and it is now found in the wild in China. In this study, we examined influences of two types of bullfrog farm (termed simple and elaborate farm enclosures) on the establishment of feral populations of this species in 137 water bodies in 66 plots in four provinces of China. The likelihood of establishment of bullfrog populations in water bodies in plots with simple enclosures (49/89 = 55.1%) was higher than those with elaborate enclosures (3/48 = 6.3%). Based on the Akaike Information Criterion, the minimum adequate model of generalized linear mixed models with a binomial error structure and a logit link function showed that the establishment or failure of bullfrog populations in water bodies was positively correlated with the presence of a simple enclosure, the number of bullfrogs raised and the presence of permanent water in a plot, but negatively correlated with distance from a bullfrog farm and the occurrence of frequent hunting. Results therefore suggest that a simple farm enclosure can increase the establishment of feral bullfrog populations compared with an elaborate enclosure. Our findings are the first to quantify the importance of improving farming enclosures to control and minimize the risk from introduced species."
https://openalex.org/W2049418722,"Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress Her2 (erbB2/neu). Up to 70% of Her2-positive breast cancers demonstrate a response to Herceptin-based therapies, but resistance almost inevitably arises within a year of the initial response. To help understand the mechanism of Herceptin resistance, we isolated clonal variants of Her2-positive BT474 human breast cancer cells (BT/Her(R)) that are highly resistant to Herceptin. These cell lines exhibit sustained PI3K/Akt signaling as an essential component of Herceptin-resistant proliferation. Several genes in the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling network have altered expression in BT/Her(R) cells, including PPP1R1B, which encodes a 32 kDa protein known as Darpp-32 and its amino-terminal truncated variant, t-Darpp. The purpose of the current work was to determine the role of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in Herceptin resistance.We determined expression of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in BT/Her(R) cells selected for resistance to Herceptin. Subsequently, cDNAs encoding the two isoforms of Darpp-32 were transfected, separately and together, into Her2-positive SK-Br-3 breast cancer cells. Transfected cells were tested for resistance to Herceptin and Herceptin-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt. DNA binding activity by the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was also measured. We found that BT/Her(R) cells overexpressed t-Darpp but not Darpp-32. Moreover, t-Darpp overexpression in SK-Br-3 cells was sufficient for conferring resistance to Herceptin and Herceptin-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt. Darpp-32 co-expression reversed t-Darpp's effects on Herceptin resistance and Akt phosphorylation. t-Darpp overexpression led to increased CREB binding activity, which was also reversible by Darpp-32.t-Darpp and Darpp-32 appear to have antagonistic effects on Herceptin resistance. We present a unified model by which these effects might be mediated via the PKA regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W2034361801,"BAD, a pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, has recently been identified as an integrator of several anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells. Thus, activation of EGFR, GPCRs or PI3K pathway leads to BAD phosphorylation and inhibition of apoptosis. Increased levels of BAD in prostate carcinomas have also been reported. It appears contradictory that instead of limiting expression of pro-apoptotic protein, prostate cancer cells choose to increase BAD levels while keeping it under tight phosphorylation control. Analysis of the effect of BAD on prostate cancer xenografts has shown that increased BAD expression enhances tumor growth, while knockdown of BAD expression by shRNA inhibits tumor growth. Tissue culture experiments demonstrated that increased BAD expression stimulates proliferation of prostate cancer cells. These results suggest that increased expression of BAD provides a proliferative advantage to prostate tumors, while BAD dephosphorylation increases sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis. Combination of proliferative and apoptotic properties prompts prostate cancer cells to be ""addicted"" to increased levels of phosphorylated BAD. Thus, kinases that phosphorylate BAD are plausible therapeutic targets; while monitoring BAD phosphorylation could be used to predict tumor response to treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1706538155,"Since interleukin (IL)-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine, mice lacking IL-18 or its ligand-binding receptor (IL-18R) should exhibit decreased cytokine and chemokine production. Indeed, production of IL-1α, IL-6, and MIP-1α was reduced in IL-18 knock-out (ko) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-like cells. Unexpectedly, we observed a paradoxical 10-fold increase in IL-1β-induced IL-6 production in MEF cells from mice deficient in the IL-18R α-chain (IL-18Rα) compared with wild type MEF. Similar increases were observed for IL-1α, MIP-1α, and prostaglandin E2. Likewise, coincubation with a specific IL-18Rα-blocking antibody augmented IL-1β-induced cytokines in wild type and IL-18 ko MEF. Stable lines of IL-18Rα-depleted human A549 cells were generated using shRNA, resulting in an increase of IL-1β-induced IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-8 compared to scrambled small hairpin RNA. In addition, we silenced IL-18Rα with small interfering RNA in primary human blood cells and observed up to 4-fold increases in the secretion of lipopolysaccharide- and IL-12/IL-18-induced IL-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ, and CD40L. Mechanistically, despite increases in Stat1 and IL-6, induction of SOCS1 and -3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and 3) was markedly reduced in the absence of IL-18Rα. Consistent with these observations, activation of the p38α/β and ERK1/2 MAPKs and of protein kinase B/Akt increased in IL-18Rα ko MEF, whereas the negative feedback kinase MSK2 was more active in IL-18 ko cells. These data reveal a role for SOCS1 and -3 in the seemingly paradoxical hyperresponsive state in cells deficient in IL-18Rα, supporting the concept that IL-18Rα participates in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses and that an endogenous ligand engages IL-18Rα to deliver an inhibitory signal. Since interleukin (IL)-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine, mice lacking IL-18 or its ligand-binding receptor (IL-18R) should exhibit decreased cytokine and chemokine production. Indeed, production of IL-1α, IL-6, and MIP-1α was reduced in IL-18 knock-out (ko) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-like cells. Unexpectedly, we observed a paradoxical 10-fold increase in IL-1β-induced IL-6 production in MEF cells from mice deficient in the IL-18R α-chain (IL-18Rα) compared with wild type MEF. Similar increases were observed for IL-1α, MIP-1α, and prostaglandin E2. Likewise, coincubation with a specific IL-18Rα-blocking antibody augmented IL-1β-induced cytokines in wild type and IL-18 ko MEF. Stable lines of IL-18Rα-depleted human A549 cells were generated using shRNA, resulting in an increase of IL-1β-induced IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-8 compared to scrambled small hairpin RNA. In addition, we silenced IL-18Rα with small interfering RNA in primary human blood cells and observed up to 4-fold increases in the secretion of lipopolysaccharide- and IL-12/IL-18-induced IL-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ, and CD40L. Mechanistically, despite increases in Stat1 and IL-6, induction of SOCS1 and -3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and 3) was markedly reduced in the absence of IL-18Rα. Consistent with these observations, activation of the p38α/β and ERK1/2 MAPKs and of protein kinase B/Akt increased in IL-18Rα ko MEF, whereas the negative feedback kinase MSK2 was more active in IL-18 ko cells. These data reveal a role for SOCS1 and -3 in the seemingly paradoxical hyperresponsive state in cells deficient in IL-18Rα, supporting the concept that IL-18Rα participates in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses and that an endogenous ligand engages IL-18Rα to deliver an inhibitory signal.

Unlike IL-1, IL-18 also induces Fas ligand and has been proposed as a key mediator of macrophage activation syndrome (23Mazodier K. Marin V. Novick D. Farnarier C. Robitail S. Schleinitz N. Veit V. Paul P. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Harlé J.R. Kaplanski G. Blood. 2005; 106: 3483-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that whereas deficiency in IL-18 attenuated inflammatory responses to various exogenous stimuli, these responses paradoxically were exaggerated in IL-18Rα ko mice (24Lewis E.C. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16852-16857Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to rejecting insulin-producing islet allografts, splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages from IL-18Rα ko mice produced significantly greater amounts of several proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation with concanavalin A, TLR2 agonist heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis, or anti-CD3 antibodies (24Lewis E.C. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16852-16857Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study, we set out to investigate the fundamental differences in cytokine production between IL-18 ko and IL-18Rα ko mice using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), which are highly responsive to IL-1 and TNFα stimulation. We also studied the role of IL-18Rα in human cells. IL-18Rα was silenced in human A549 epithelial cells using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to the IL-18R (shIL-18R) as well as in freshly obtained human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Furthermore, using inhibitors as well as kinase activation studies, real time PCR, and Western blotting, we shed light on the IL-18Rα ko-mediated differences in expression and activation of signaling mediators, such as the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), MAPKs, protein kinase B/Akt, NF-κB, MSK2/RSKβ, and p70 S6 kinase. The mechanisms underlying the disinhibition of inflammatory responses in IL-18Rα-deficient cells appear to be due to a yet unidentified anti-inflammatory ligand of the IL-18 receptor. S. epidermidis was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (strain 49134), grown overnight in suspension cultures in LB medium (Difco), centrifuged, and washed in pyrogen-free saline, and a small sample was removed for determination of number of organisms by pour plate cultures. The suspension was boiled for 30 min and then remained at room temperature for 24 h. The boiled suspension was diluted in pyrogen-free saline to 10 million organisms/ml and frozen in small aliquots at −70 °C. Antibodies for the mouse cytokine assays MIP-1α, MIP-2, TNFα, and IL-1α were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human IL-1β was as previously described (25Dinarello C.A. Cannon J.G. Mancilla J. Bishai I. Lees J. Coceani F. Brain Res. 1991; 562: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and murine TNFα was obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Anti-mouse IL-18Rα was a kind gift from Dirk Smith (Amgen, Seattle, WA). Anti-mouse IL-18Rα was also obtained from R&D Systems. The murine IL-6 ELISA and goat biotinylated IgG were from R&D Systems. Alexa Fluor 488 wheat germ agglutinin was purchased from Invitrogen. Bisbenzimide was from Sigma, and ibuprofen was provided by The Upjohn Co. Cell culture media were obtained from Cellgro (Herndon, VA). For extracting total RNA, the RNeasyPlus Mini Kit was used (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). GeneAmp® RNA PCR kit, core kit, and GeneAmp® Fast PCR Master Mix were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). IL-18 ko and IL-18Rα ko mice (both C57BL/6 background) and wild type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), housed five per cage, and kept on a 12-h light-dark cycle. All experiments were approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice of each strain were anesthetized with isoflurane on days 13–16 of pregnancy and sacrificed by rapid cervical dislocation. Embryos were removed, separated from the uterine horns, and washed three times with 10 ml of PBS without calcium/magnesium. After removal of the head and organs, the embryos were washed three times with 10 ml of PBS without calcium or magnesium. The embryos were then minced, and 2 ml of trypsin/EDTA with 100 Kunitz units of DNase I per embryo was added (Sigma). The mixture was incubated, gently shaking at room temperature for 15 min together with 5-mm glass beads to create a single cell suspension. The trypsin digestion was stopped by adding 20 ml of MEF medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids). The undigested tissue pieces settled to the bottom, and the supernatant was removed and subjected to low speed centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of MEF medium and plated in a culture flask. The medium was changed the following day. Examination on day 3 revealed a homogenous layer of fibroblast-like cells. For the experiments in this study, MEF passages 1–5 were used. Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA (Sigma) and plated in flat-bottom wells. After 24–48 h of growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, cells were stimulated with the cytokines or inhibitors for the indicated time periods. After 24 h, the supernatant was removed for measuring secreted cytokines. The cells in the wells were then washed and lysed as described previously (26Petry C. Fritz G. Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1636: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After 20 min, the wells were scraped with a rubber policeman. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was removed for protein determination and IL-1α determination by the ECL assay. Human lung carcinoma A549 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in a 6-well plate a day before transfection. Cells were washed with 2 ml of TOM medium (Welgene, Dae-gu, Korea) and incubated for 30 min in 1 ml of the same medium prior to transfection. In the meantime, the transfection mixture for each well was prepared as follows. 5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was suspended in 100 μl of TOM medium. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 1 μg of plasmid DNA comprising equal parts of four sequences of pGeneClip-IL-18Rα shRNA (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) was added, followed by another 15-min incubation. The transfection mixture was then added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 5 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Thereafter, 1 ml of cell culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. On the next day, cells were trypsinized and transferred into a 9-cm2 plate. When the cells had adhered to the plate, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 μg/ml of puromycin dihydrochloride (Cellgro, Manassas, VA). The selection medium was exchanged every 3 days with fresh selection medium until individual colonies appeared, which took place between 10 and 14 days. Small pieces of circular 3 MM papers were sterilized, wet with trypsin, and then used for picking individual colonies. Colonies were transferred into 24-well plates containing 1 ml of selection medium in each well. An individual clone was grown until the cells reached a population of 106, and each clone was screened by Western blot analysis. PBMC were isolated from freshly obtained blood from healthy volunteers by density gradient centrifugation. Transfection with the Amaxa (Cologne, Germany) Nucleofector device was performed as described previously (27Nold M.F. Nold-Petry C.A. Pott G.B. Zepp J.A. Saavedra M.T. Kim S.H. Dinarello C.A. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A pool of four OnTargetplus antisense RNA sequences from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Lafayette, CO) at 62.5 nm each (250 nm total) was used for silencing of IL-18Rα. For control, PBMC were transfected with identical concentrations of OnTargetplus non-targeting pools. After overnight recovery, 106 PBMC were transferred into 48-well plates containing 400 μl of RPMI with 1% pooled human serum and primocin (1:500, Amaxa) and then stimulated for 4 or 20 h. Supernatants from these cultures were assayed for cytokines; lysates were subjected to Western blot or real time PCR analysis. To analyze A549 lysates, 5 × 105 cells were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked in 5% skim milk. The membranes were probed with mouse anti-IL-18Rα (R&D Systems) and normalized with goat anti-actin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). For SOCS1 and SOCS3 analysis in PBMC and MEF, lysates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, blotting, and staining with rabbit anti-mouse SOCS1 or rabbit anti-human/mouse SOCS3. Murine MIP-1α, MIP-2, and IL-1α as well as human IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured by an ECL assay as described previously (28Fantuzzi G. Reed D. Qi M. Scully S. Dinarello C.A. Senaldi G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using the Origen Analyzer (BioVeris, Gaithersburg, MD). Murine IL-6 and human TGF-β1 were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems). Supernatants from the PBMC experiments were subjected to multiplex analysis using microtiter plates spotted with antibodies to eight cytokines from R&D Systems (MosaicTM ELISA human cytokine panel 1) and then analyzed in the Q-ViewTM Imager from Quansys Biosciences (Logan, UT) according the manufacturer's protocols. In addition, the samples were diluted and measured by specific ELISA (R&D Systems). Isolated MEF were grown in culture slides, washed with PBS, and fixed with a 70%/30% mixture of acetone/methanol. After fixation for 15 min at room temperature, the cells were blocked for 1 h in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) containing 10% donkey serum (Sigma) at room temperature. Staining was performed overnight at 4 °C using a biotinylated goat anti-mouse IL-18Rα antibody (2.5 μg/ml; R&D Systems) in PBS containing 1% BSA. The corresponding concentration of nonimmune goat IgG was used as a negative control. Streptavidin conjugated to Cy3 (dilution 1:1000) was used for detections. All membranes were stained with Alexa Fluor 488® conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin; nuclei were stained with bisbenzimide (Sigma) in a concentration of 1 μg/100 ml. Digital confocal imaging was performed using a Leica DM RXA microscope equipped with SlideBook software for MacIntosh (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). First strand cDNA was synthesized from random hexamer-primed RNA, isolated from MEF samples, using TaqMan® reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). The first strand cDNA template synthesized from each MEF RNA sample was then used for the amplification of target genes in a quantitative PCR assay using TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and Source Molecular Diagnostics (Boulder, CO) primer-probe sets (29McLoughlin K. Turteltaub K. Bankaitis-Davis D. Gerren R. Siconolfi L. Storm K. Cheronis J. Trollinger D. Macejak D. Tryon V. Bevilacqua M. Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each target gene assay was multiplexed with an 18 S rRNA endogenous control and performed in triplicate on the ABI Prism® 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Normalized gene expression values, termed ΔCT values, for each amplified gene were calculated by taking the difference between the PCR cycle threshold (CT) value of the target gene and its own endogenous 18 S rRNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control. The difference in normalized gene expression values between samples (ΔΔCT value) was calculated to determine the relative difference in transcript levels between sample types. For example, a ΔΔCT value of 2 is equivalent to 4-fold change in the amount of the transcript between sample types. Paired and unpaired t tests were used for statistical analysis. Treatments that differed from controls by more than 2 S.D. values were considered as significant. Individual p values are reported. To investigate the differences in cytokine production between wild type (WT), IL-18 ko, and IL-18Rα ko mice in a single cell type, embryonic fibroblasts of each mouse strain were generated. As shown in Fig. 1, immunofluorescence was used to detect expression of IL-18Rα; IL-18Rα was absent in IL-18Rα ko MEF cells (C). An IgG control antibody was used as the control staining in the Cy3 channel (insets). In addition, MEF cells derived from IL-18 ko mice appear slender and to have at least two pseudopods. By comparison, WT cells appeared as normal spindle-shaped fibroblasts, whereas IL-18Rα ko MEF cells have a prominent cytosol and are round. During the course of these studies, we generated several MEF lines of WT, IL-18 ko, and IL-18Rα ko, each from a different mother. In Table 1, examples of four MEF lines from each strain are presented. The differences between the three MEF cell types were remarkably consistent, despite each being derived from a different mother. In some experiments, more than six lines were studied and exhibited similar results. Replicate experiments, therefore, do not represent MEF cells derived from a single mother but rather data from MEF cells derived from at least four different mothers.TABLE 1MIP-1α protein in supernatants from individual MEF isolationsNumberMouse strainMIP-1αpg/mg1Wild type742Wild type673Wild type604Wild type621IL-18 ko202IL-18 ko83IL-18 ko744IL-18 ko461IL-18Rα ko1682IL-18Rα ko1573IL-18Rα ko2004IL-18Rα ko154 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2A shows that compared with WT MEF, IL-18Rα ko MEF cells stimulated with different concentrations of IL-1β secreted considerably more MIP-1α per mg of total protein, whereas MEF cells deficient in IL-18 secreted less of the chemokine. These differences in the production of MIP-1α between the three cell types were apparent using concentrations of IL-1β as low as 100 pg/ml (Fig. 2A, left). When the concentration of IL-1β was increased to 25 ng/ml, there was a marked decrease in the amount of MIP-1α released from the WT as well as the IL-18-deficient MEF cells. In contrast to WT and IL-18-deficient cells exposed to higher concentrations of IL-1β, IL-18Rα ko MEF cells produced more than 10-fold higher levels of MIP-1α. The three MEF cell lines were then studied for their responses to TNFα. As shown in Fig. 2B, the differences were similar to those observed in response to IL-1β. In IL-18Rα ko MEF cells stimulated with TNFα, 2-fold higher levels of MIP-1α were observed compared with WT, but MIP-1α was 10-fold lower in cells deficient in IL-18. These differences were observed at either 1 or 10 ng/ml of TNFα. Fig. 2D illustrates that 1 ng/ml IL-1β is more effective at inducing MIP-1α in each MEF strain than 10 ng/ml TNFα. We next compared the responses in MEF cells after 6 h of stimulation with IL-1β. Under these conditions, cells deficient in IL-18Rα produced 10-fold more MIP-1α (Fig. 2C). Whereas chemokines, such as MIP-1α, are readily secreted, IL-1α is primarily an intracellular cytokine. Therefore, we measured the intracellular levels of IL-1α in the three MEF cell lines from the same cultures depicted in Fig. 2. When stimulated with IL-1β, IL-18Rα ko MEF cells contained 20-fold higher levels of IL-1α compared with wild type cells and 40-fold more IL-1α than IL-18-deficient MEF cells. Using a lower concentration of IL-1β (100 pg/ml), nearly the same differences were observed (Fig. 3A). Using 25 ng/ml IL-1β, the levels of IL-1α in WT and IL-18-deficient cells were below detection (<20 pg/mg total protein), whereas in IL-18Rα ko MEF (Fig. 3A), the levels were impressively greater. Upon TNFα stimulation, similar differences were obtained (Fig. 3B). The comparison of IL-1β and TNFα as inducers of IL-1α in the different MEF strains (Fig. 3C) revealed similar regulation of MIP-1α, in that 1 ng/ml IL-1β stimulated more IL-1α release than 10 ng/ml TNFα. We next examined IL-1β-induced IL-6 in the three different MEF strains. As shown in Fig. 3D, IL-1β at 100 pg/ml induced more than 6,000 pg of IL-6/mg of total protein in IL-18Rα ko cells, whereas one-tenth this amount was present in the supernatants of WT or IL-18 ko cells. Unlike production of IL-1α, IL-6, and MIP-1α, we observed no differences in the production of PGE2 between WT and IL-18 ko MEF. However, IL-18Rα-deficient cells secreted 2–3-fold more PGE2 than the other two strains under unstimulated conditions as well as after stimulation with IL-1β or TNFα (Fig. 3E). In order to examine decreased function of IL-18Rα in WT MEF cells, we used an anti-murine IL-18Rα-blocking antibody. After 20 h of incubation with the antibody, there was a dose-dependent increase in spontaneous IL-6 production in WT (2.5-fold at 100 ng/ml antibody and 6.5-fold at 500 ng/ml) compared with the level of IL-6 in WT MEF cells incubated without the antibody (Fig. 4A). We next stimulated WT MEF cells with IL-1β in the presence of the blocking antibody. IL-1β-stimulated IL-6 production was set at 1.0 in WT MEF cells incubated without the antibody; in the presence of the antibody, IL-6 increased (1.4-fold at 100 ng/ml and 1.75-fold at 500 ng/ml). As shown in Fig. 4C, the spontaneous production of MIP-1α was also increased in the presence of the antibody. At a 100 ng/ml concentration of the blocking antibody, spontaneous MIP-1α increased 8-fold. In WT cells stimulated with IL-1β, the increase was 2.5-fold (Fig. 4D). The effect of blocking IL-18Rα in MEF cells deficient in IL-18 itself was also studied. The rationale for this experiment was to evaluate blocking IL-18Rα in the complete absence of IL-18 in these cells. As such, there is no endogenous IL-18 to compete with a putative other ligand utilizing IL-18Rα. As shown in Fig. 4A, spontaneous IL-6 was markedly increased in IL-18 ko cells in the presence of the blocking antibody (12- and 18-fold at antibody concentrations of 100 and 500 ng/ml, respectively). These increases are significantly greater than the increases in WT MEF cells under the same conditions. In IL-18 ko MEF cells stimulated with IL-1β, the increases were again greater compared with the increases in WT cells. Fig. 4, C and D, depicts the data on MIP-1α production in the same cultures. In MEF cells deficient in IL-"
https://openalex.org/W2028213328,"Human FBP21 (formin-binding protein 21) contains a matrin-type zinc finger and two tandem WW domains. It is a component of the spliceosomes and interacts with several established splicing factors. Here we demonstrate for the first time that FBP21 is an activator of pre-mRNA splicing in vivo and that its splicing activation function and interaction with the splicing factor SIPP1 (splicing factor that interacts with PQBP1 and PP1) are both mediated by the two tandem WW domains of group III. We determined the solution structure of the tandem WW domains of FBP21 and found that the WW domains recognize peptide ligands containing either group II (PPLP) or group III (PPR) motifs. The binding interfaces involve both the XP and XP2 grooves of the two WW domains. Significantly, the tandem WW domains of FBP21 are connected by a highly flexible region, enabling their simultaneous interaction with two proline-rich motifs of SIPP1. The strong interaction between SIPP1 and FBP21 can be explained by the conjugation of two low affinity interactions with the tandem WW domains. Our study provides a structural basis for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the functional implication of FBP21 and the biological specificity of tandem WW domains."
https://openalex.org/W2047995544,"SH3 domains, which are among the most frequently occurring protein interaction modules in nature, bind to peptide targets ranging in length from 7 to more than 25 residues. Although the bulk of studies on the peptide binding properties of SH3 domains have focused on interactions with relatively short peptides (less than 10 residues), a number of domains have been recently shown to require much longer sequences for optimal binding affinity. To gain greater insight into the binding mechanism and biological importance of interactions between an SH3 domain and extended peptide sequences, we have investigated interactions of the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain (AbpSH3) with several physiologically relevant 17-residue target peptide sequences. To obtain a molecular model for AbpSH3 interactions, we solved the structure of the AbpSH3 bound to a target peptide from the yeast actin patch kinase, Ark1p. Peptide target complexes from binding partners Scp1p and Sjl2p were also characterized, revealing that the AbpSH3 uses a common extended interface for interaction with these peptides, despite Kd values for these peptides ranging from 0.3 to 6 μm. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that residues across the whole 17-residue binding site are important both for maximal in vitro binding affinity and for in vivo function. Sequence conservation analysis revealed that both the AbpSH3 and its extended target sequences are highly conserved across diverse fungal species as well as higher eukaryotes. Our data imply that the AbpSH3 must bind extended target sites to function efficiently inside the cell.

Many protein interactions within signaling pathways are mediated by small modular domains, which are found within larger proteins (1Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are one of the most frequently occurring of these protein-protein interaction modules in eukaryotic cells. These domains are ∼60-residue β-sheet proteins that have been generally observed to bind to short proline-rich peptides containing the core consensus sequences +XXPXXP (class I) or PXXPX+ (class II), where X can be a variety of residues, and + is a Lys or Arg residue (2Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 3Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O.

SH3 domains often bind peptides with modest affinities (5–100 μm (5Jia C.Y. Nie J. Wu C. Li C. Li S.S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1155-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), and many SH3 domains appear to possess low specificity, binding to various PXXP-containing peptides with similar affinities (6Castagnoli L. Costantini A. Dall'Armi C. Gonfloni S. Montecchi-Palazzi L. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Cesareni G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Ladbury J.E. Arold S.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the establishment of a “promiscuous model,” which postulates that the signaling specificity of pathways depends primarily on factors other than the intrinsic binding properties of isolated SH3 domains (11Agrawal V. Kishan K.V. Protein Pept. Lett. 2002; 9: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and that short peptide targets are likely sufficient for SH3 domain function. Arguing against this model, it has been shown that some SH3 domains require an extended target peptide (12–30 residues) to achieve maximal binding affinity (12Bauer F. Schweimer K. Meiselbach H. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Sticht H. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2487-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Berry D.M. Nash P. Liu S.K. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Curr.

These results imply that the intrinsic specificity of SH3 domains may indeed play a significant role. The growing realization of the importance of interactions between SH3 domains and extended peptides provides the motivation for further studies to investigate their molecular mechanisms and functional properties. In the present study, we have investigated the SH3 domain from the yeast actin-binding protein 1 (Abp1p), 3The abbreviations used are: Abp1pactin-binding protein 1AbpSH3Abp1p SH3 domainITCisothermal titration calorimetryNOEnuclear Overhauser effectWTwild typePPIIpolyproline type IIApcadenomatous polyposis coli protein. 3The abbreviations used are: Abp1pactin-binding protein 1AbpSH3Abp1p SH3 domainITCisothermal titration calorimetryNOEnuclear Overhauser effectWTwild typePPIIpolyproline type IIApcadenomatous polyposis coli protein. which is known to interact with extended peptide targets. Abp1p is an actin-associated protein that possesses an N-terminal actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin homology domain, a central Pro-rich region, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Through its multiple protein-protein interactions, Abp1p plays important roles in coordinating the dynamic series of events leading to endocytosis (16Kaksonen M. Toret C.P. Drubin D.G. Cell. 2005; 123: 305-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In particular, the Abp1p SH3 domain (AbpSH3) binds to and localizes the actin patch kinases, Ark1p and Prk1p (17Fazi B. Cope M.J. Douangamath A. Ferracuti S. Schirwitz K. Zucconi A. Drubin D.G.

Groen A.C. Cope M.J. Kaksonen M. Watson H.A. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Wendland B. McDonald K.L. McCaffery J.M. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and also mediates the localization of the Synaptojanin-like protein, Sjl2p, to the actin patch where it plays key roles in endocytosis (19Stefan C.J. Padilla S.M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2910-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The AbpSH3 is essential for the biological activity of Abp1p under all genetic and growth conditions where Abp1p is required for cell viability (20Haynes J. Garcia B. Stollar E.J. Rath A. Andrews B.J. Davidson A.R. Genetics. 2007; 176: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Abp1p is highly conserved both in fungi and higher eukaryotes, and its homologues in mammalian cells are also involved in processes such as endocytosis that require actin rearrangement (reviewed in Ref. 22Engqvist-Goldstein A.E.

Nature. 2003; 426: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The conservation seen in an alignment of these peptide sequences and results from phage display experiments imply that a region spanning at least 10 residues is critical for AbpSH3 binding (17Fazi B. Cope M.J. Douangamath A. Ferracuti S. Schirwitz K. Zucconi A. Drubin D.G. Wilmanns M. Cesareni G. Castagnoli L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5290-5298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In particular, the total conservation in AbpSH3 binding sites of Leu at a position three residues C-terminal to the PXXPx+ core consensus strongly suggests that extended peptide interactions are crucial for the function of the domain. A distinctive feature of the AbpSH3 as compared with most other yeast SH3 domains is that its interactions with target peptides in three different proteins, Ark1p, Scp1p, and Sjl2p, have been proven to be physiologically relevant. Deletion of the genes encoding these proteins, or deletion of the Abp1p SH3 domain binding sites within them, leads to a phenocopy of AbpSH3 mutations (19Stefan C.J. Padilla S.M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2910-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Haynes J. Garcia B. Stollar E.J. Rath A. Andrews B.J. Davidson A.R. Genetics. 2007; 176: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, which target site residues are crucial for binding and whether the whole site is required for in vivo function are not known. The well characterized nature of the AbpSH3 and its biologically relevant peptides coupled with our ability to probe the function of this domain in an authentic in vivo system (20Haynes J. Garcia B. Stollar E.J. Rath A. Andrews B.J. Davidson A.R. Genetics. 2007; 176: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) make it an excellent model for addressing the mechanism and importance of extended target peptide interactions. The goals of the work described here were to elucidate the molecular details of the AbpSH3 peptide binding and to evaluate the functional importance of the extended AbpSH3 binding interface. To this end, we used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of the AbpSH3 bound to a 17-residue peptide from the Ark1p target protein. In addition, we assessed the in vitro affinities and in vivo functional properties of three biologically relevant peptides and a series of target peptide mutants. These studies combined with an analysis of AbpSH3 binding site conservation among diverse fungal species have allowed us to clearly demonstrate the functional importance of the interaction of the AbpSH3 with extended target peptides. Residues 535–592 of the yeast Abp1p protein (AbpSH3 construct) or the residues KKTKPTPPPKPSHLKPK from the yeast protein Ark1p peptide (ArkA construct) were expressed from a pET32b-based (Novagen) plasmid to produce proteins with thioredoxin and a 6-His tag fused at the N terminus. These fused portions were ultimately removed using tobacco etch virus protease. Protein purification was carried by nickel-affinity chromatography as previously described (20Haynes J. Garcia B. Stollar E.J. Rath A. Andrews B.J. Davidson A.R. Genetics. 2007; 176: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The AbpSH3 was further purified through chromatography on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Target peptides were further purified using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a Phenomenex C18 preparatory column, using a 0 to 50% gradient of acetonitrile over 5 column volumes to obtain a purity of >95% judged by mass spectrometry. Unlabeled peptides for ITC measurements were synthesized (Biomer Technology, Hayward, CA) with C-terminal amidation and N-terminal acetylation and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography as above. The synthesized and synthetic peptides gave the same heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra and bound with the same affinity. Experiments were measured at 10 °C on a Varian INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a pulsed field gradient unit and a triple resonance probe. Samples were in buffer containing 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% NaN3, 10% D2O, unless otherwise stated. We titrated 15N,13C ArkA-labeled peptide into 15N,13C-labeled AbpSH3, to obtain a 1:1 complex as judged by minimization of peak broadening for both AbpSH3 and peptide due to exchange between free and complexed states. Standard experiments were then used to assign the backbone and side-chain resonances of the doubly labeled AbpSH3·ArkA peptide complex (26Kanelis V. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Assignments were incomplete for atoms with complete peak broadening, which include the side chains of Tyr-10 and Phe-50 in AbpSH3 and the Cϵ and NZ atoms at the end of the Lys−3 side chain in ArkA. Structural restraints were restricted to NOEs, and HN-N, N-CO, CA-HA, CO-CA, and CA-CB residual dipolar couplings from a sample oriented in phage (27Mittermaier A. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6892-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The axial component of the alignment tensor (Da) was 9.0, and the rhombicity (Dr/Da) was 0.37. Due to the large number of backbone restraints, we were able to exclude TALOS-based (29Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) dihedral angle restraints. After initial assignment of 300 NOEs, for which symmetry-related peaks were observed, ARIA1.2 was used to facilitate the assignment of NOEs and calculate structures. The 20 lowest energy structures, of 200 calculated in the final iteration, were used for analysis. PROCHECK software (30Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the Ramachandran plots (supplemental Table S1). We collected backbone T1, T2, and 1HN-15N NOE data for the free and ArkA-bound complexes at two different concentrations (0.3 mm and 1 mm) to calculate correlation times and check for any concentration-dependent oligomerization. The correlation times stayed constant at the different concentrations (8.08 and 7.97 ns, respectively), confirming a 1:1 complex as seen from the ITC data. The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift differences between free and bound complexes were calculated using the following expression: Δppm = √((Nppm shift * 0.1)2 +(Hppm shift)2), where Nppm shift is the difference in ppm in the nitrogen dimension and Hppm is the difference in ppm in the proton dimension. The structure has been deposited into the protein data bank, accession code: 2rpn. Experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, following our previously described procedure (20Haynes J. Garcia B. Stollar E.J. Rath A. Andrews B.J. Davidson A.R. Genetics. 2007; 176: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least two times. Plasmid expression vectors to produce WT and mutant versions of Ark1p fused to green fluorescent protein were derived from pRS316. The ARK1 gene was amplified by PCR from yeast chromosomal DNA using primers (5′-TAGGGCGAATTGGAGCTCCACCGCGGTGGCGGCCGCTGAGAGGACTGGCAGGGGGA-3′ and 5′-GAATTGGGACAACTCCAGTGAAAAGTTCTTCTCCTTTACTCTTATCCAAGGATAACTTTCG-3′), which anneal to the ARK1 gene (in bold) and contain pRS316 and green fluorescent protein sequences, respectively, to flank the ARK1 gene. All ARK1 AbpSH3 binding site mutations were created by PCR. All generated constructs were sequenced to ensure that no unwanted mutations were introduced during plasmid construction. The plasmids used in this study can be found in supplemental Table S3. Yeast strains and plasmids used are listed in supplemental Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Strains were manipulated, and media were prepared using standard techniques (31Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 12-18Google Scholar). Standard rich medium supplemented with glucose (YPD, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) was used for yeast growth without selection. Minimal medium (SD) lacking uracil was used for transformants selection and plasmid maintenance. To assay growth on solid media, cells were grown overnight to saturation in selective media supplemented with 2% dextrose and the appropriate amino acids. Serial 10-fold dilutions of an equal number of cells (0.1 A600 nm) were spotted onto SD (lacking uracil) plates, and incubation was for 2 days at 30 °C or 37 °C. All growth assays were repeated at least three times, and one representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4. The same levels of growth were seen in all repetitions. We carried out bioinformatic investigations on 29 species of fungi in addition to Saccharomyces cerevisiae that were identified as possessing homologues of Abp1p in BLAST search (Altschul, et al. (45Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70559) Google Scholar)) of the Uniprot data base (www.pir.uniprot.org/). Target protein homologues were also identified by BLAST searches. The validity of hits from these searches was confirmed by detection of regions of high sequence similarity across the length of the protein sequences. Although we analyzed sequence conservation across all 29 species, considerable sequence redundancy existed among them. We show alignments of sequences from some of the most diverse species examined. The pattern of conservation seen in these smaller alignments is fully representative of what was observed in the full alignments. The identification of AbpSH3 binding sites in higher eukaryotic genomes was carried out using the sequence motif defining and searching programs, MEME and MAST (32Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 33Bailey T.L. Williams N. Misleh C. Li W.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W369-W373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mechanism of peptide binding by the AbpSH3, we determined its solution structure bound to a 17-residue peptide from Ark1p, which we refer to as ArkA. We previously showed that this is the tightest binding target peptide with proven biological relevance (20Haynes J. Garcia B. Stollar E.J. Rath A. Andrews B.J. Davidson A.R. Genetics. 2007; 176: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The structure of AbpSH3·ArkA complex was constrained using intra-SH3 domain, intra-peptide, and intermolecular NOEs and dipolar couplings (statistics are found in supplemental Table S1). The twenty lowest energy structures overlay with backbone root mean square deviation of 0.37 ± 0.2 Å (supplemental Fig. S1). Ramachandran statistics are not as good as might be expected considering the large number of restraints on the SH3 domain backbone. This may be due to conformational fluctuations observed in the bound state SH3 domain. This was apparent for residues Lys(−3), Tyr-10, and Phe-50 based on peak broadening and for Asp-15 based on CPMG experiments performed in excess of peptide (data not shown). The AbpSH3 displays a typical SH3 domain fold, consisting of a five-stranded β-sandwich with the long irregularly structured RT-loop between strands 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). Superposition of all backbone residues to the x-ray structure of the unliganded form of AbpSH3 (pdb code 1JO8) (17Fazi B. Cope M.J. Douangamath A. Ferracuti S. Schirwitz K. Zucconi A. Drubin D.G. Wilmanns M. Cesareni G. Castagnoli L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5290-5298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated a good fit (backbone root mean square deviation of 0.85 ± 0.04 Å). The regions with the highest root mean square deviation were the N and C termini as well as the RT-loop region with up to 3 ± 0.5 Å differences at the tip of the loop. The significant difference in the conformation of the RT-loop may be the result of a rearrangement occurring upon peptide binding, because this region is directly involved in the binding reaction. This is consistent with several other studies that have shown a role for RT-loop flexibility in binding (34Arold S. O'Brien R. Franken P. Strub M.P. Hoh F. Dumas C. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14683-14691Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Lee C.H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The ArkA peptide, which binds in a class II orientation (2Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 3Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), contains an N-terminal left-handed polyproline type II (PPII) helix and a C-terminal 310 helix (Fig. 1A). There are significant numbers of intermolecular NOEs throughout the binding interface (17 peptide residues spanning from Lys6 to Lys−8) indicating that the complete peptide is involved in binding (we have used a standard numbering system (3Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) for peptide positions) (Fig. 1B). An overlay of the ArkA peptide conformers from multiple low energy structures shows that the backbone and side-chain atoms overlay well across 13 residues from position 3 to −9 (Fig. 1E). Even at peptide position Lys6 where the peptide structure is more variable, parts of this residue are still packed against the domain in every structure (Fig. 1C). The PXXP region of the peptide interacts in a typical manner for SH3 domains with P(2), P(0), and P(−1) well packed into two grooves lined primarily by the conserved residues Tyr8, Tyr10, Trp36, Tyr54, Pro51, and Asn53 (36Larson S.M. Di Nardo A.A. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). We refer to this conserved PPII helix-interaction surface as surface I (37Kim J. Lee C.D. Rath A. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Peptide residue Lys3 is also packed tightly against the domain, and its side chain lies near both Asp9 and Asp11 where electrostatic interactions may play a stabilizing role. Although it lies in a less well defined region of peptide structure, the side chain of peptide residue Lys6 invariably points toward the domain positioned near residues Asp9 and Glu22 (Fig. 1A). Thus, most N-terminal residues in the peptide interact with the AbpSH3. Residues in the C-terminal extended region of the ArkA peptide (positions −4 to −9) make multiple contacts with residues in a surface that is distinct from the PXXP binding interface, which we refer to as surface II (37Kim J. Lee C.D. Rath A. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Most notably, Leu−7 is highly buried, packing against Val32, Asp33, Trp36, and Leu49 on the domain, and Pro−4 and His−6 on the peptide (Fig. 1D). His−6 is also able to form an intermolecular salt bridge with Asp33. Interestingly, peptide residues extending out as far as Lys−8 and Pro−9 make close contacts with the domain at RT-loop residues Glu14 and Asp15, respectively. Finally, as seen in other structures (37Kim J. Lee C.D. Rath A. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), peptide residue Lys−3 interacts at the dividing line between surface I and II, packing against Trp36 and making electrostatic interactions with the RT-loop residues, Glu14 and Asp15. Surprisingly, the Cϵ and NZ atoms at the end of the Lys−3 side chain are completely broadened, indicating substantial dynamics even though this residue is crucial for the binding reaction, explaining the undefined position of its side chain (Fig. 1E). To identify the thermodynamically critical interactions in the AbpSH3-peptide interface, and evaluate the affinity requirements for in vivo function, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantitate the binding affinities of wild-type (WT) and mutant AbpSH3-binding peptides. Initially, affinities for 17-residue long peptides from the three different biologically relevant Abp1p-interacting proteins, Ark1p, Scp1p, and Sjl2, were measured. Because Ark1p possesses tandem binding sites for the AbpSH3, which we call ArkA and ArkB, we tested these sites separately. Although the AbpSH3 bound the ArkA and Scp1 sites very tightly with Kd values of 0.27 and 0.7 μm, respectively, the ArkB and Sjl2 sites bound much more weakly with Kd values of ∼6 μm (Fig. 2A). Thus, the biologically relevant interactions of this domain are seen to vary over a 20-fold range in affinity. Interestingly, combining the ArkA and ArkB sites into one site as they are found in Ark1p resulted in no significant increase in affinity over ArkA. It is also notable that the Scp1 and Sjl2 sites lack a PXXP motif, and yet were still able to bind with high affinities compared with the majority of SH3 domain-peptide interactions. To ensure that the Sjl2, Scp1, and ArkB peptides bound in the same manner as the ArkA peptide investigated in our NMR studies, we assigned the NMR resonances of AbpSH3 in complex with these peptides, and calculated the difference in the chemical shifts of each backbone amide resonance in the free and complexed state. As seen in Fig. 3, the overall pattern of chemical shift changes was very similar for the Sjl2 and ArkA peptides despite their very different amino acid sequences (only 6 identical residues out of 17), indicating that the Sjl2 peptide binds the same surface and utilizes the same binding mechanism as the ArkA peptide. A similar result was obtained when the other target peptides were tested in this manner (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 3Backbone amide chemical shift differences between the free and bound AbpSH3 complexes. The ArkA target complex is in white and Sjl2 target complex is in black. Surface I and surface II residues are boxed in thin and thick lines, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2154475100,"LmrA is a multidrug ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter from Lactococcus lactis with no known physiological substrate, which can transport a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents and toxins from the cell. The protein can functionally replace the human homologue ABCB1 (also termed multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1) in lung fibroblast cells. Even though LmrA mediates ATP-dependent transport, it can use the proton-motive force to transport substrates, such as ethidium bromide, across the membrane by a reversible, H(+)-dependent, secondary-active transport reaction. The mechanism and physiological context of this reaction are not known.We examined ion transport by LmrA in electrophysiological experiments and in transport studies using radioactive ions and fluorescent ion-selective probes. Here we show that LmrA itself can transport NaCl by a similar secondary-active mechanism as observed for ethidium bromide, by mediating apparent H(+)-Na(+)-Cl(-) symport. Remarkably, LmrA activity significantly enhances survival of high-salt adapted lactococcal cells during ionic downshift.The observations on H(+)-Na(+)-Cl(-) co-transport substantiate earlier suggestions of H(+)-coupled transport by LmrA, and indicate a novel link between the activity of LmrA and salt stress. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of investigations into the bioenergetics of substrate translocation by ABC transporters for our understanding of fundamental mechanisms in this superfamily. This study represents the first use of electrophysiological techniques to analyze substrate transport by a purified multidrug transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1995234586,"Background Endosomal small GTPases of the Rab family, among them Rab4a, play an essential role in the control of the glucose transporter GLUT4 trafficking, which is essential for insulin-mediated glucose uptake. We found that adipocytes also expressed Rab4b and we observed a consistent decrease in the expression of Rab4b mRNA in human and mice adipose tissue in obese diabetic states. These results led us to study this poorly characterized Rab member and its potential role in glucose transport. Methodology/Principal Findings We used 3T3-L1 adipocytes to study by imaging approaches the localization of Rab4b and to determine the consequence of its down regulation on glucose uptake and endogenous GLUT4 location. We found that Rab4b was localized in endosomal structures in preadipocytes whereas in adipocytes it was localized in GLUT4 and in VAMP2-positive compartments, and also in endosomal compartments containing the transferrin receptor (TfR). When Rab4b expression was decreased with specific siRNAs by two fold, an extent similar to its decrease in obese diabetic subjects, we observed a small increase (25%) in basal deoxyglucose uptake and a more sustained increase (40%) in presence of submaximal and maximal insulin concentrations. This increase occurred without any change in GLUT4 and GLUT1 expression levels and in the insulin signaling pathways. Concomitantly, GLUT4 but not TfR amounts were increased at the plasma membrane of basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes. GLUT4 seemed to be targeted towards its non-endosomal sequestration compartment. Conclusion/Significance Taken our results together, we conclude that Rab4b is a new important player in the control of GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes and speculate that difference in its expression in obese diabetic states could act as a compensatory effect to minimize the glucose transport defect in their adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2091516763,"Magi 4, now renamed delta-hexatoxin-Mg1a, is a 43-residue neurotoxic peptide from the venom of the hexathelid Japanese funnel-web spider (Macrothele gigas) with homology to delta-hexatoxins from Australian funnel-web spiders. It binds with high affinity to receptor site 3 on insect voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels but, unlike delta-hexatoxins, does not compete for the related site 3 in rat brain despite being previously shown to be lethal by intracranial injection. To elucidate differences in Na(V) channel selectivity, we have undertaken the first characterization of a peptide toxin on a broad range of mammalian and insect Na(V) channel subtypes showing that delta-hexatoxin-Mg1a selectively slows channel inactivation of mammalian Na(V)1.1, Na(V)1.3, and Na(V)1.6 but more importantly shows higher affinity for insect Na(V)1 (para) channels. Consequently, delta-hexatoxin-Mg1a induces tonic repetitive firing of nerve impulses in insect neurons accompanied by plateau potentials. In addition, we have chemically synthesized and folded delta-hexatoxin-Mg1a, ascertained the bonding pattern of the four disulfides, and determined its three-dimensional solution structure using NMR spectroscopy. Despite modest sequence homology, we show that key residues important for the activity of scorpion alpha-toxins and delta-hexatoxins are distributed in a topologically similar manner in delta-hexatoxin-Mg1a. However, subtle differences in the toxin surfaces are important for the novel selectivity of delta-hexatoxin-Mg1a for certain mammalian and insect Na(V) channel subtypes. As such, delta-hexatoxin-Mg1a provides us with a specific tool with which to study channel structure and function and determinants for phylum- and tissue-specific activity."
https://openalex.org/W1997056322,"For some years, chimpanzees have been observed eating the pith of decaying palm trees of Raphia farinifera in the Budongo Forest, Uganda. The reasons for doing this have until now been unknown. An analysis of the pith for mineral content showed high levels of sodium to be present in the samples. By contrast, lower levels were found in bark of other tree species, and also in leaf and fruit samples eaten by chimpanzees. The differences between the Raphia samples and the non-Raphia samples were highly significant (p<0.001). It is concluded that Raphia provides a rich and possibly essential source of sodium for the Budongo chimpanzees. Comparison of a chewed sample (wadge) of Raphia pith with a sample from the tree showed a clear reduction in sodium content in the chewed sample. Black and white colobus monkeys in Budongo Forest also feed on the pith of Raphia. At present, the survival of Raphia palms in Budongo Forest is threatened by the use of this tree by local tobacco farmers."
https://openalex.org/W2126400382,"The bacterial Tn5 and Tn10 transposases have a single active site that cuts both strands of DNA at their respective transposon ends. This is achieved using a hairpin intermediate that requires the DNA to change conformation during the reaction. In Tn5 these changes are controlled in part by a flipped nucleoside that is stacked on a tryptophan residue in a hydrophobic pocket of the transposase. Here we have investigated the base flipping mechanism in Tn10 transposition. As in Tn5 transposition, we find that base flipping takes place after the first nick and is required for efficient hairpin formation and resolution. Experiments with an abasic substrate show that the role of base flipping in hairpin formation is to remove the base from the DNA helix. Specific interactions between the flipped base and the stacking tryptophan residue are required for hairpin resolution later in the reaction. We show that base flipping in Tn10 transposition is not a passive reaction in which a spontaneously flipped base is captured and retained by the protein. Rather, it is driven in part by a methionine probe residue that helps to force the flipped base from the base stack. Overall, it appears that base flipping in Tn10 transposition is similar to that in Tn5 transposition."
https://openalex.org/W1976969773,"Biomass has been studied as biomarker to evaluate the effect of heavy metals on microbial communities. Nevertheless, the most important methodological problem when working with natural and artificial microbial mats is the difficulty to evaluate changes produced on microorganism populations that are found in thicknesses of just a few mm depth.Here, we applied for first time a recently published new method based on confocal laser scanning microscopy and image-program analysis to determine in situ the effect of Pb and Cu stress in cyanobacterial populations.The results showed that both in the microcosm polluted by Cu and by Pb, a drastic reduction in total biomass for cyanobacterial and Microcoleus sp. (the dominant filamentous cyanobacterium in microbial mats) was detected within a week. According to the data presented in this report, this biomass inspection has a main advantage: besides total biomass, diversity, individual biomass of each population and their position can be analysed at microscale level. CLSM-IA could be a good method for analyzing changes in microbial biomass as a response to the addition of heavy metals and also to other kind of pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W1993798977,"DNA replication has a finite measurable error rate, net of repair, in all cells. Clonal proliferation of cancer cells leads therefore to accumulation of random mutations. A proportion of these mutational events can create new immunogenic epitopes that, if processed and presented by an MHC allele, may be recognized by the adaptive immune system. Here, we use probability theory to analyze the mutational and epitope composition of a tumor mass in successive division cycles and create a double Pölya model for calculating the number of truly tumor-specific MHC I epitopes in a human tumor. We deduce that depending upon tumor size, the degree of genomic instability and the degree of death within a tumor, human tumors have several tens to low hundreds of new, truly tumor-specific epitopes. Parenthetically, cancer stem cells, due to the asymmetry in their proliferative properties, shall harbor significantly fewer mutations, and therefore significantly fewer immunogenic epitopes. As the overwhelming majority of the mutations in cancer cells are unrelated to malignancy, the mutation-generated epitopes shall be specific for each individual tumor, and constitute the antigenic fingerprint of each tumor. These calculations highlight the benefits for personalization of immunotherapy of human cancer, and in view of the substantial pre-existing antigenic repertoire of tumors, emphasize the enormous potential of therapies that modulate the anti-cancer immune response by liberating it from inhibitory influences."
https://openalex.org/W2053617247,"ALK-1 is a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily receptor that is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for angiogenesis, as demonstrated by the embryonic lethal phentoype when targeted for deletion in mice and its mutation in the human disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Although ALK-1 and the endothelial-specific TGF-beta superfamily coreceptor, endoglin, form a heteromeric complex and bind similar TGF-beta superfamily ligands, their signaling mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here we report the identification of CK2beta, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase CK2, as a novel enhancer of ALK-1 signaling. The cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 specifically binds to CK2beta in vitro and in vivo. NAAIRS mutagenesis studies define amino acid sequences 181-199 of CK2beta and 207-212 of ALK-1 as the interaction domains, respectively. The ALK-1/CK2beta interaction specifically enhanced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and ALK-1-mediated reporter activation in response to TGF-beta1 and BMP-9 treatment. In a reciprocal manner, siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous CK2beta inhibited TGF-beta1 and BMP-9-stimulated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and ALK-1-mediated reporter activation. Functionally, CK2beta enhanced the ability of activated or ligand-stimulated ALK-1 to inhibit endothelial cell migration. Similarly, ALK-1 and CK2beta antagonized endothelial tubule formation in Matrigel. These studies support CK2beta as an important regulator of ALK-1 signaling and ALK-1-mediated functions in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974701973,"Both the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways play an important role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. We conducted the present study to test the hypothesis that targeting the two pathways to potently induce cell inhibition accompanied with thyroid iodide-handling gene expression for adjunct radioiodine ablation could be a novel effective therapeutic strategy for melanoma. We used specific shRNA approaches and inhibitors to individually or dually suppress the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways and examined the effects on a variety of molecular and cellular responses of melanoma cells that harbored activating genetic alterations in the two pathways. Suppression of the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways showed potent anti-melanoma cell effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation, transformation and invasion, induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and, when the two pathways were dually suppressed, cell apoptosis. Remarkably, suppression of the two pathways, particularly simultaneous suppression of them, also induced expression of genes that are normally expressed in the thyroid gland, such as the genes for sodium/iodide symporter and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. Melanoma cells were consequently conferred the ability to take up radioiodide. We conclude that dually targeting the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways for potent cell inhibition coupled with induction of thyroid gene expression for adjunct radioiodine ablation therapy may prove to be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1978242613,"Background Neurotrophic factors have been shown to possess strong neuroprotective and neurorestaurative properties in Parkinson's disease patients. However the issues to control their delivery into the interest areas of the brain and their surgical administration linked to their unability to cross the blood brain barrier are many drawbacks responsible of undesirable side effects limiting their clinical use. A strategy implying the use of neurotrophic small molecules could provide an interesting alternative avoiding neurotrophin administration and side effects. In an attempt to develop drugs mimicking neurotrophic factors, we have designed and synthesized low molecular weight molecules that exhibit neuroprotective and neuritogenic potential for dopaminergic neurons. Principal Findings A cell-based screening of an in-house quinoline-derived compound collection led to the characterization of compounds exhibiting both activities in the nanomolar range on mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in spontaneous or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced neurodegeneration. This study provides evidence that rescued neurons possess a functional dopamine transporter and underlines the involvement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway in these processes. Conclusion Cell-based screening led to the discovery of a potent neurotrophic compound possessing expected physico-chemical properties for blood brain barrier penetration as a serious candidate for therapeutic use in Parkinson disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020458322,"IgY is the principal serum antibody in birds and reptiles, and an IgY-like molecule was the evolutionary precursor of both mammalian IgG and IgE. A receptor for IgY on chicken monocytes, chicken leukocyte receptor AB1 (CHIR-AB1), lies in the avian leukocyte receptor cluster rather than the classical Fc receptor cluster where the genes for mammalian IgE and IgG receptors are found. IgG and IgE receptors bind to the lower hinge region of their respective antibodies with 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas the myeloid receptor for IgA, FcalphaRI, and the IgG homeostasis receptor, FcRn, which are found in the mammalian leukocyte receptor cluster, bind with 2:1 stoichiometry between the heavy chain constant domains 2 and 3 of each heavy chain. In this paper, the extracellular domain of CHIR-AB1 was expressed in a soluble form and shown to be a monomer that binds to IgY-Fc with 2:1 stoichiometry. The two binding sites have similar affinities: K(a)(1) = 7.22 +/- 0.22 x 10(5) m(-1) and K(a)(2) = 3.63 +/- 1.03 x 10(6) m(-1) (comparable with the values reported for IgA binding to its receptor). The affinity constants for IgY and IgY-Fc binding to immobilized CHIR-AB1 are 9.07 +/- 0.07 x 10(7) and 6.11 +/- 0.02 x 10(8) m(-1), respectively, in agreement with values obtained for IgY binding to chicken monocyte cells and comparable with reported values for human IgA binding to neutrophils. Although the binding site for CHIR-AB1 on IgY is not known, the data reported here with a monomeric receptor binding to IgY at two sites with low affinity suggest an IgA-like interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2047628133,"Elevated sphingolipids have been associated with increased cardiovascular disease. Conversely, atherosclerosis is reduced in mice by blocking de novo synthesis of sphingolipids catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The SPT enzyme is composed of the SPTLC1 and -2 subunits, and here we describe a novel protein-protein interaction between SPTLC1 and the PDZ protein Par3 (partitioning defective protein 3). Mammalian SPTLC1 orthologs have a highly conserved C terminus that conforms to a type II PDZ protein interaction motif, and by screening PDZ domain protein arrays with an SPTLC1 C-terminal peptide, we found it bound the third PDZ domain of Par3. Overlay and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed this interaction and indicate Par3 is able to associate with the SPTLC1/2 holoenzyme by binding the C-terminal SPTLC1 PDZ motif. The physiologic existence of the SPTLC1/2-Par3 complex was detected in mouse liver and macrophages, and short interfering RNA inhibition of Par3 in human THP-1 monocytes significantly reduced SPT activity and de novo ceramide synthesis by nearly 40%. Given monocyte recruitment into inflamed vessels is thought to promote atherosclerosis, and because Par3 and sphingolipids have been associated with polarized cell migration, we tested whether the ability of THP-1 monocytes to migrate toward MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) depended upon Par3 and SPTLC1 expression. Knockdown of Par3 significantly reduced MCP1-induced chemotaxis of THP-1 monocytes, as did knockdown of SPTLC1, and this Par3 effect depended upon SPT activity and was blunted by ceramide treatment. In conclusion, protein arrays were used to identify a novel SPTLC1-Par3 interaction that associates with increased monocyte serine palmitoyltransferase activity and chemotaxis toward inflammatory signals."
https://openalex.org/W2094448324,"Background One of the challenges in exploiting high throughput measurement techniques such as microarrays is the conversion of the vast amounts of data obtained into relevant knowledge. Of particular importance is the identification of the intrinsic response of a transcriptional experiment and the characterization of the underlying dynamics. Methodology and Findings The proposed algorithm seeks to provide the researcher a summary as to various aspects relating to the dynamic progression of a biological system, rather than that of individual genes. The approach is based on the identification of smaller number of expression motifs that define the transcriptional state of the system which quantifies the deviation of the cellular response from a control state in the presence of an external perturbation. The approach is demonstrated with a number of data sets including a synthetic base case and four animal studies. The synthetic dataset will be used to establish the response of the algorithm on a “null” dataset, whereas the four different experimental datasets represent a spectrum of possible time course experiments in terms of the degree of perturbation associated with the experiment as well as representing a wide range of temporal sampling strategies. This wide range of experimental datasets will thus allow us to explore the performance of the proposed algorithm and determine its ability identify relevant information. Conclusions and Significance In this work, we present a computational approach which operates on high throughput temporal gene expression data to assess the information content of the experiment, identify dynamic markers of important processes associated with the experimental perturbation, and summarize in a concise manner the evolution of the system over time with respect to the experimental perturbation."

GARS is ubiquitously expressed and may have functions in addition to its canonical role in protein synthesis through catalyzing the addition of glycine to cognate tRNAs.We have recently described a new mouse model with a point mutation in the Gars gene resulting in a cysteine to arginine change at residue 201. Heterozygous Gars(C201R/+) mice have locomotor and sensory deficits. In an investigation of genetic mutations that lead to death of motor and sensory neurons, we have crossed the Gars(C201R/+) mice to two other mutants: the TgSOD1(G93A) model of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the Legs at odd angles mouse (Dync1h1(Loa)) which has a defect in the heavy chain of the dynein complex. We found the Dync1h1(Loa/+);Gars(C201R/+) double heterozygous mice are more impaired than either parent, and this is may be an additive effect of both mutations. Surprisingly, the Gars(C201R) mutation significantly delayed disease onset in the SOD1(G93A);Gars(C201R/+) double heterozygous mutant mice and increased lifespan by 29% on the genetic background investigated.These findings raise intriguing possibilities for the study of pathogenetic mechanisms in all three mouse mutant strains."

The transmission of genetic information is thought to be uncommon, apart from recent reports of exosomal RNA transfer in immune and glioblastoma cells. We wished to examine if existing microvesicle pathways could be directly targeted for the horizontal transfer of RNA genomes in less specialized cell types. Using replication-deficient retrovirus vector, studies herein confirm that a range of cells routinely sequester a small population of these RNA genomes in a non-canonical compartment, refractory to antibody neutralization and unaffected by specific pharmacological inhibition of pathways involved in conventional viral trafficking. Our experiments further reveal the cytoplasmic colocalization of vector genomes with tetraspanin proteins as well as the PI-3-kinase sensitive trafficking and subsequent transmission to 2 degrees targets. Collectively, our results indicate a scalable process whereby cells route vector genomes to multivesicular bodies (MVB) for cytoplasmic trafficking and exosomal release. Our findings imply that cells can serve to deliver recombinant payload, targeted for the stable genetic modification of 2 degrees target cells."

Three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. Nsp4 is localized to the ER membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected cells. It is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N- and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol.We have determined the crystal structures of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of nsp4 (nsp4C) from MHV strain A59 and a C425S site-directed mutant. The highly conserved 89 amino acid region from T408 to Q496 is shown to possess a new fold. The wild-type (WT) structure features two monomers linked by a Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond in one asymmetric unit. The monomers are arranged with their N- and C-termini in opposite orientations to form an ""open"" conformation. Mutation of Cys425 to Ser did not affect the monomer structure, although the mutant dimer adopts strikingly different conformations by crystal packing, with the cross-linked C-termini and parallel N-termini of two monomers forming a ""closed"" conformation. The WT nsp4C exists as a dimer in solution and can dissociate easily into monomers in a reducing environment.As nsp4C is exposed in the reducing cytosol, the monomer of nsp4C should be physiological.

https://openalex.org/W2008120192,"Neurons in the visual cortex are responsive to the presentation of oriented and curved line segments, which are thought to act as primitives for the visual processing of shapes and objects. Prolonged adaptation to such stimuli gives rise to two related perceptual effects: a slow change in the appearance of the adapting stimulus (perceptual drift), and the distortion of subsequently presented test stimuli (adaptational aftereffects). Here we used a psychophysical nulling technique to dissociate and quantify these two classical observations in order to examine their underlying mechanisms and their relationship to one another. In agreement with previous work, we found that during adaptation horizontal and vertical straight lines serve as attractors for perceived orientation and curvature. However, the rate of perceptual drift for different stimuli was not predictive of the corresponding aftereffect magnitudes, indicating that the two perceptual effects are governed by distinct neural processes. Finally, the rate of perceptual drift for curved line segments did not depend on the spatial scale of the stimulus, suggesting that its mechanisms lie outside strictly retinotopic processing stages. These findings provide new evidence that the visual system relies on statistically salient intrinsic reference stimuli for the processing of visual patterns, and point to perceptual drift as an experimental window for studying the mechanisms of visual perception."

However, arguments have been made to include the “elongation” factor TFIIS (6Kim B. Nesvizhskii A.I. Rani P.G. Hahn S. Aebersold R. Ranish J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16068-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the mediator complex (7Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 80-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in the list of “general” transcription factors. RNAP II and most of the TFs are multimeric protein complexes. If all proteins contained in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) RNAP II initiation complex were considered, the count of ∼60 polypeptides would have a mass of ∼3 MDa (8Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12955-12961Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The high resolution crystal structure of yeast RNAP II has provided invaluable insight into the topology of the RNAP II transcription initiation complex (9Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structures of bacterial RNAP (10Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 11Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and RNAP from an archaeal organism (12Hirata A. Klein B.J. Murakami K.S. Nature. 2008; 451: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) establish that RNAP from all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) show high conservation of overall structure. However, many mechanistic details of the transcription process have yet to be determined. RNA polymerase II adenovirus-2 major late promoter bovine serum albumin C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNAP II mismatched minimal promoter Ad2 MLP in the mismatched minimal promoter nuclear extract nucleotide(s) 74-kDa component of TFIIF 30-kDa component of TFIIF TATA-binding protein of TFIID transcription factor transcription factor IIB N-terminal domain of TFIIB C-terminal domain of TFIIB transcription factor IIE transcription factor IIF transcription factor IIH transcription factor IIS dithiothreitol monoclonal antibody. TFIIB functions as a single polypeptide with a two-domain structure. The C-terminal domain of TFIIB (cTFIIB) contains an imperfect direct repeat motif. The co-crystal structure of cTFIIB with the DNA-bound TATA-binding protein (TBP) of TFIID shows that the direct repeats of cTFIIB are responsible for interacting with TBP (13Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, cTFIIB interacts with DNA upstream and downstream of the TBP-bound TATA-box (reviewed in Ref. 14Deng W. Roberts S.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and also interacts with the “wall” region of yeast RNAP II in pre-initiation complexes (15Chen H.T. Warfield L. Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of TFIIB (nTFIIB) contains a zinc ribbon followed by a region that is highly conserved in TFIIB from many species. Early work showed that one function of nTFIIB is to bridge the RNAP II·TFIIF complex to the TBP·cTFIIB·DNA complex at the promoter (16Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Barberis A. Müller C.W. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5628-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, Cho and Buratowski (18Cho E.J. Buratowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25807-25813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) later showed that the nTFIIB probably plays an additional role in post-preinitiation complex formation. Yeast nTFIIB has been crystallized in a complex with yeast RNAP II (19Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The crystal structure (at 4.5 Å) shows the zinc ribbon contacting the largest subunit of RNAP II (Rpb1) at the previously described “dock” region (9Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The highly conserved region of nTFIIB threads into the “saddle” of the RNAP II and then returns by the same path, creating a loop, or “B-finger,” that approaches the active site of the enzyme and occupies the RNA exit channel (19Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This location was supported by biochemical dissection of the yeast B-finger region, using residue-positioned hydroxyl radical cleavage (20Chen H.T. Hahn S. Cell. 2004; 119: 169-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutations in residues Glu-62 and Arg-78 of yeast TFIIB were studied before structural information was available because they affect start site selection on the yeast cyc1 gene (21Pinto I. Wu W.H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two residues are within the B-finger region of yeast TFIIB as described from the co-crystal structure of yeast RNAP II and nTFIIB (19Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and these charged residues are believed to form a salt bridge (21Pinto I. Wu W.H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low resolution crystal structure suggests that these two residues are positioned to accommodate a salt bridge (19Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Mutations in the homologous residues in human TFIIB (Glu-51 and Arg-66) have been studied and seem to affect start site selection in a promoter-specific manner (22Hawkes N.A. Roberts S.G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14337-14343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Fairley J.A. Evans R. Hawkes N.A. Roberts S.G.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms for start site selection in yeast and human are different, with yeast employing a more elaborate “scanning” mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 5Hampsey M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Given the presumed role of the B-finger in transcription initiation and the high conservation of amino acid sequence among species, it is surprising that other investigators have reported some in vitro transcriptional activity in HeLa cell NE using deletion mutants that lack part or all of the human TFIIB B-finger (24Tubon T.C. Tansey W.P. Herr W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Tran K. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15665-15671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in a defined transcription system that lacks all of the archaeal B-finger region (26Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 8344-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). No systematic study has addressed the role of the individual residues of the B-finger in a defined transcription system. Eukaryotic minimal promoter systems that require only RNAP II, TBP, and TFIIB were first described in 1993 (27Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 28Tyree C.M. George C.P. Lira-DeVito L.M. Wampler S.L. Dahmus M.E. Zawel L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These minimal promoter systems are similar to the archaeal transcription system (reviewed in Ref. 29Reeve J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, only a few eukaryotic promoters can be transcribed by a minimal set of factors and only if the promoter is contained in the context of a super-coiled template (27Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 28Tyree C.M. George C.P. Lira-DeVito L.M. Wampler S.L. Dahmus M.E. Zawel L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a minimal promoter complex can be studied on a linear template if the promoter contains a properly placed mismatch, creating a bubble over the initiation site (30Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These template topologies eliminate the need for TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Although TFIIF is not required, transcription on the mismatched promoter system can be stimulated by TFIIF (30Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transcription on supercoiled templates can be stimulated by the addition of the RNA polymerase-associated protein 30 (RAP30), a component of TFIIF (28Tyree C.M. George C.P. Lira-DeVito L.M. Wampler S.L. Dahmus M.E. Zawel L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have found minimal promoter systems to be useful in studying the small group of transcription proteins: RNAP II, TBP, TFIIB, and RAP30 (31Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 32Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Nolan K.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4735-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Duellman S.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 35: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The information obtained from the co-crystal structure of yeast RNAP II with the yeast nTFIIB (19Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), prompted us to test mutations in the human TFIIB B-finger in minimal promoter systems. We undertook an extensive, systematic mutagenic examination of the B-finger region of human TFIIB. We have characterized the mutant TFIIB proteins in two minimal promoter systems, using only calf thymus RNAP II, human TBP, and human TFIIB. We then examined the behavior of these mutants in the complex HeLa cell NE. These results yield insight into the biology of B-finger region of human TFIIB and indicate why transcriptional activity of TFIIB mutants can differ in the minimal promoter systems and complex promoter systems. All general chemicals were at least reagent grade and obtained from major commercial suppliers. Where specific materials were required, we have noted the vendor. TE buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9. TBE buffer contained 90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Phosphate-buffered saline contained 2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm KCl, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Gel-shift buffer contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol (Fisher Scientific), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mm MgCl2. Buffer D contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The IgH promoter transcription buffer contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 150 μg/ml acetylated BSA (Promega, Madison, WI), and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The mismatched minimal promoter (MMP) assay buffer contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. BLOTTO contained 1% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline. All pH values were determined at 23 °C. To create point mutations in human TFIIB, a cassette containing the N-terminal domain of the human TFIIB was constructed. The coding region of TFIIB (obtained from Danny Reinberg, Robert Woods Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ) was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET33b (EMD/Novagen, Madison, WI), which contains a NcoI site in the multiple cloning site. Digestion of this plasmid with NcoI yielded a 444-bp fragment containing 72 bp from the vector and nucleotides 1–372 of human TFIIB due to an internal NcoI site in TFIIB. This fragment was cloned into the NcoI site of pGEM5zf (Promega) and used as a cassette for the mutagenesis of TFIIB. Oligonucleotides containing the specific point mutations were prepared by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, and mutations were generated by use of the QuikChange system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that uses a PCR amplified with a high fidelity enzyme (pfu). Sequencing was performed by the McArdle Laboratory DNA Sequencing Facility, using an automatic ABI PRISM 373 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to identify the mutated clones. The cassette containing the desired mutation was then cloned back into TFIIB contained in either pET11a, using the NdeI and NcoI sites (1–372), or into TFIIB contained in pET33b, using the NcoI site in the vector and the NcoI site at position 372 of TFIIB. Cloning into pET33b yielded a His6 tag (contained in a 25-amino acid tag) fused to the N terminus of TFIIB. All final constructs were sequenced by the automated method. The construct that allowed the B-finger to be exchanged was prepared from the construct containing TFIIB cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET33b vector. The BamHI site at the 3′-end of this construct was destroyed by cutting with BamHI, filling in the ends with Klenow, and ligating the blunt ends together. Point mutations in the human B-finger were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, incorporating a new BamHI site and a KpnI site into the coding region at each end of the B-finger. The result was a silent mutation at residue 49 (Gly-49) and an amino acid change at residue 69 (D69T). Pairs of oligonucleotides were prepared that correspond to the B-finger sequence of the desired B-finger, containing sticky BamHI and KpnI sites at the ends. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase, mixed in equimolar proportions, and heated to 95 °C for 20 min in a heating block. The heating block was then allowed to return to room temperature (∼1 h), and the annealed oligonucleotides were purified from agarose gels with a gel-extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia., CA) and ligated into the plasmid containing TFIIB that had been cut with BamHI and KpnI. All constructs were sequenced. mAbs IIB8 and IIB5 that react with human TFIIB were prepared by standard hybridoma methods and have been described (32Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Nolan K.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4735-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The epitope for mAb IIB8 is contained within residues 61–68 of human TFIIB (34Duellman S.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 35: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The epitope for mAb IIB5 is not well defined, but is known to be contained within amino acids 106–316 of human TFIIB (33Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Nolan K.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4735-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared as described (33Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Nolan K.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4735-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except that the secondary antibody was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA), and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection. For Western blots, the mAb contained in ascites fluid was diluted 1:1000. In experiments that used mAb II8 to inhibit transcription, the antibody was purified by affinity chromatography on staphylococcal protein A as described (32Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Nolan K.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4735-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of TFIIB from HeLa cell NE, using mAb IIB8, was performed by a modification of the method previously described (33Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Nolan K.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4735-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These modifications allowed us to more thoroughly immunodeplete the extract and gave a more robust, easily quantifiable signal with the addition of the purified bacterially expressed TFIIB. The HeLa cell NE (200 μl) was heated to 47 °C for 15 min to inactivate the TFIID (35Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Five aliquots were processed, and the aliquots were pooled. Protein A-agarose beads (Repligen, Waltham, MA) were blocked with 1% nonfat, dry milk (1% BLOTTO) that had been centrifuged and filtered to remove insoluble material. The blocked beads (∼600 μl) were treated with mAb IIB8 (25 μl of ascites fluid) in a volume of 1.5 ml of BLOTTO for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed 5 times with l ml of Buffer D and resuspended in 600 μl of Buffer D. The beads were distributed into 2 small columns (300 μl each). The heat-treated NE (∼1 ml) was sequentially passed through each column containing the mAb IIB8-immobilized beads. Thus, the NE was immunodepleted sequentially with two batches of immobilized mAb IIB8. All TFIIB mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS by inducing log phase cells (A600 nm = 0.6) with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5 h. Many of the point mutations in the B-finger region of human TFIIB reacted with the polyol-responsive mAb IIB8 (34Duellman S.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 35: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These mutants were expressed from pET11a and purified from the soluble fraction by the immunoaffinity chromatography procedure described previously (32Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TFIIB and mutants of TFIIB contained in pET33b, which incorporates a His6 tag, a thrombin site, and a kinase site (25 amino acids) at the N terminus of the protein, were purified from the soluble fraction by chromatography on an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The His6-tagged TFIIB was eluted with 100–200 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled, the proteins were dialyzed against Buffer D (without DTT) for 4 h at 4 °C, and then supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. TFIIB preparations were flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Purified yeast TFIIB was a kind gift from David Bushnell and Roger Kornberg (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Calf thymus RNA polymerase II was purified either by the immunoaffinity chromatography procedure described previously (36Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the standard chromatography method of Hodo and Blatti (37Hodo 3rd, H.G. Blatti S.P. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Human TBP was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described (38Thompson N.E. Foley K.M. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 36: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The RAP30 subunit of human TFIIF was expressed and purified as described (31Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TFIIF was prepared by the method of Wang et al. (39Wang B.Q. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar), using a microplate assay and the Bradford reagent obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). BSA was used as a protein standard. All protein preparations were stored in Buffer D, frozen in small volumes in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Dilutions of each protein were prepared in Buffer D before being incorporated into the transcription assay. Transcriptions using the IgH minimal promoter system were performed as described by Parvin and Sharp (27Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (33Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Nolan K.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4735-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, template DNA was incubated with TBP (10–20 ng) in 3 μl of gel-shift buffer for 3 min at 23 °C. Differing amounts (25–100 ng) of TFIIB (or mutant TFIIB) and calf thymus RNAP II (2 μg) were added, and the complex was allowed to form by incubation at 23 °C for 5 min. The complex was diluted to 21 μl with the transcription buffer, and then initiated with a mixture of NTPs (400 μm ATP and CTP, 100 μm 3′-O-methyl-GTP, and 80 μm UTP containing 10 μCi of 32P-labeled α-UTP). After 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped and extracted with a mixture of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol, using 10 μg of yeast tRNA as a carrier. Transcripts were run on a gel containing 6 m urea and 7% polyacrylamide. Transcriptions using the MMP system used a double-stranded oligonucleotide (85 bp) containing the adenovirus-2 major late promoter (Ad2 MLP) with a mismatch over the sequences −9 to +3 with respect to the Ad2 MLP start site. These reactions were performed by a modification (34Duellman S.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 35: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of the method described by Pan and Greenblatt (30Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that a dinucleotide primer was not used in the reactions except where noted. Components of the reaction were added in the order described above for the IgH promoter, and the reactions processed identically to reactions containing the IgH promoter. Transcripts were run on a gel containing 6 m urea and 20% polyacrylamide. The transcription product from this promoter system was a 10-nt RNA with the sequence ACUCUCUUCC. In experiments using the dinucleotide CpA (Ribomed Biotechnologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) as a primer, the CpA (0.5 mm) was added to the DNA template and incubated for 5 min at 23 °C before the other components of the reaction were added. The transcript product was then an 11-nt RNA with the sequence CACUCUCUUCC. Transcriptions using the Ad2 MLP on a linearized template and a HeLa cell NE were performed by a modification of the procedure described previously (41Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HeLa cell NE was heat-treated to inactivate the TFIID activity (35Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and immunodepleted of TFIIB as described above. For reconstitution assays, the template was incubated with purified human TBP and purified TFIIB in gel-shift buffer for 5 min at room temperature. The heat-treated, immunodepleted HeLa cell NE was then added to the TBP·DNA·TFIIB complex and incubated at room temperature for an additional 5 min. Transcriptions were initiated by the addition of a mixture of NTPs (200 μm ATP, CTP, UTP, and 20 μm of GTP containing 10 μCi of 32P-labeled α-GTP), incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and processed as described previously (41Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All TFIIB mutations were tested using at least three levels of protein to correct for variability in the protein determination assays. Autoradiograms were prepared from all transcription assays; all transcriptions were quantified by the use of a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In transcriptions using the Ad2 MLP in the mismatched promoter (MLP MMP), only the 10-nt transcript was quantified. In all experiments, background readings were taken in each lane above the quantified band; this background value was subtracted from value of the quantified band. The figu"
https://openalex.org/W1997728725,"Cytotoxic T cells kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells by releasing lytic granules that contain cell-killing contents. Exocytosis requires calcium influx and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Here, we extend our previous finding regarding the lack of isoform specificity of PKCs in the granule release step, showing that mutant constitutively active PKCdelta can substitute for phorbol esters and support exocytosis. PKCdelta, a novel PKC isoform, was recently shown to play a role in lytic granule reorientation. Surprisingly, however, our results suggested that mutant PKCdelta did not localize to the plasma membrane (PM). To test directly whether PKC has to be in the PM to drive exocytosis, we generated mutants of various PKC isoforms that were tethered either to the outer mitochondrial membrane or to the PM. Tethered mutant PKCdeltas were able to promote exocytosis as effectively as the untethered version. The substrates of PKCs involved in lytic granule exocytosis are currently unknown, but subcellular localization is believed to be a critical factor in determining PKC accessibility to substrates. That there is no requirement for specific PKC localization in lytic granule exocytosis may have important implications for the identity of PKC substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2005978542,"Here we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of the first solid-phase substrates for prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), a cytosolic serine peptidase associated with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and related neuropsychiatric disorders. This study seeks to contribute to the future design of a one-bead one-compound (OBOC) peptide library of POP substrates, based on an intramolecular energy transfer substrate. Unexpectedly, the enzymatic evaluation of the substrates attached on solid-phase by means of the HMBA linker were cleaved through the ester bond, thereby suggesting an unknown esterase activity of POP, in addition to its known peptidase activity. By performing multiple activity assays, we have confirmed the esterase activity of this enzyme and its capacity to process the substrates on solid-phase. Finally, we tested a new linker, compatible with both the solid-phase peptide-synthesis used and the enzymatic assay, for application in the future design of an OBOC library."
https://openalex.org/W2065377477,"Background Until very recently, AcrB was the only Resistance Nodulation and cell Division transporter for which the structure has been elucidated. Towards a general understanding of this protein family, CusA and AcrB were compared. Methodology/Principal Findings In dodecylmaltoside, AcrB crystallised in many different conditions, while CusA does not. This could be due to the difference in dynamic between these proteins as judged from limited proteolysis assays. Addition of various compounds, in particular heavy metal cations, stabilises CusA. Conclusion/Significance This approach could constitute a first step towards CusA crystallisation."
https://openalex.org/W2133745149,"Genome sequencing and bioinformatics have provided the full hypothetical proteome of many pathogenic organisms. Advances in microarray and mass spectrometry have also yielded large output datasets of possible target proteins/genes. However, the challenge remains to identify new targets for drug discovery from this wealth of information. Further analysis includes bioinformatics and/or molecular biology tools to validate the findings. This is time consuming and expensive, and could fail to yield novel drugs if protein purification and crystallography is impossible. To pre-empt this, a researcher may want to rapidly filter the output datasets for proteins that show good homology to proteins that have already been structurally characterised or proteins that are already targets for known drugs. Critically, those researchers developing novel antibiotics need to select out the proteins that show close homology to any human proteins, as future inhibitors are likely to cross-react with the host protein, causing off-target toxicity effects later in clinical trials.To solve many of these issues, we have developed a free online resource called Genomes2Drugs which ranks sequences to identify proteins that are (i) homologous to previously crystallized proteins or (ii) targets of known drugs, but are (iii) not homologous to human proteins. When tested using the Plasmodium falciparum malarial genome the program correctly enriched the ranked list of proteins with known drug target proteins.Genomes2Drugs rapidly identifies proteins that are likely to succeed in drug discovery pipelines. This free online resource helps in the identification of potential drug targets. Importantly, the program further highlights proteins that are likely to be inhibited by FDA-approved drugs. These drugs can then be rapidly moved into Phase IV clinical studies under 'change-of-application' patents."
https://openalex.org/W2043520300,Canine plasminogen is made up of seven domains. In each domain there are several cysteines that are linked by disulfide bonds. Reduction of a limited number of the cystines destabilizes the protein such that it precipitates. The bond or bonds that are broken provide about 14 kcal of stabilization energy. Circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering indicate that there is probably an intermediate that is formed prior to precipitation and that the intermediate is somewhat larger than the compact form of plasminogen.
https://openalex.org/W2017745581,"The certainty of judgment (or self-confidence) has been traditionally studied in relation with the accuracy. However, from an observer's viewpoint, certainty may be more closely related to the consistency of judgment than to its accuracy: consistent judgments are objectively certain in the sense that any external observer can rely on these judgments to happen. The regions of certain vs. uncertain judgment were determined in a categorical rating experiment. The participants rated the size of visual objects on a 5-point scale. There was no feedback so that there were no constraints of accuracy. Individual data was examined, and the ratings were characterized by their frequency distributions (or categories). The main result was that the individual categories always presented a core of certainty where judgment was totally consistent, and large peripheries where judgment was inconsistent. In addition, the geometry of cores and boundaries exhibited several phenomena compatible with the literature on visual categorical judgment. The ubiquitous presence of cores in absence of accuracy constraints provided insights about objective certainty that may complement the literature on subjective certainty (self-confidence) and the accuracy of judgment."
