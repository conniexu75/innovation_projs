https://openalex.org/W1979054322,"Converting Polarization The conversion of a light signal from one polarization direction to another plays an important role in communication and metrology. The components that are presently used for polarization conversion, however, tend to be relatively large, which is an issue that can make it difficult to integrate with chip-scale optoelectronic circuits. Grady et al. (p. 1304 , published online 16 May) used a metasurfaces approach involving a designed array of cut wires to manipulate the polarization state of the propagating terahertz signals. Proper design of the device structure allowed for the control of the polarization conversion state for both reflected and transmitted light over a broad frequency range."
https://openalex.org/W1982729887,"A new tool to visualize high-dimensional single-cell data, when integrated with mass cytometry, reveals phenotypic heterogeneity of human leukemia. New high-dimensional, single-cell technologies offer unprecedented resolution in the analysis of heterogeneous tissues. However, because these technologies can measure dozens of parameters simultaneously in individual cells, data interpretation can be challenging. Here we present viSNE, a tool that allows one to map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the high-dimensional structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a visual similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise distances in high dimension to determine each cell's location in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with viSNE to map healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia samples map into malformed shapes that are distinct from healthy bone marrow and from each other. We also use viSNE and mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population reminiscent of minimal residual disease. viSNE can be applied to any multi-dimensional single-cell technology."
https://openalex.org/W2049632862,"Graphene, Gapped and Butterflied The remarkable transport properties of graphene, such as the high electron mobility, make it a promising material for electronics. However, unlike semiconductors such as silicon, graphene's electronic structure lacks a band gap, and a transistor made out of graphene would not have an “off” state. Hunt et al. (p. 1427 , published online 16 May; see the Perspective by Fuhrer ) modulated the electronic properties of graphene by building a heterostructure consisting of a graphene flake resting on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which has the same honeycomb structure as graphene, but consists of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms instead of carbons. The natural mismatch between the graphene and hBN lattices led to a moire pattern with a large wavelength, causing the opening of a band gap, the formation of an elusive fractional quantum Hall state, and, at high magnetic fields, a fractal phenomenon in the electronic structure called the Hofstadter butterfly."
https://openalex.org/W1999211990,"Autophagy is the primary cellular catabolic program activated in response to nutrient starvation. Initiation of autophagy, particularly by amino-acid withdrawal, requires the ULK kinases. Despite its pivotal role in autophagy initiation, little is known about the mechanisms by which ULK promotes autophagy. Here we describe a molecular mechanism linking ULK to the pro-autophagic lipid kinase VPS34. Following amino-acid starvation or mTOR inhibition, the activated ULK1 phosphorylates Beclin-1 on Ser 14, thereby enhancing the activity of the ATG14L-containing VPS34 complexes. The Beclin-1 Ser 14 phosphorylation by ULK is required for full autophagic induction in mammals and this requirement is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our study reveals a molecular link from ULK1 to activation of the autophagy-specific VPS34 complex and autophagy induction."
https://openalex.org/W2033708181,"Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2110768394,"Single-cell RNA sequencing is used to investigate the transcriptional response of 18 mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells after lipopolysaccharide stimulation; many highly expressed genes, such as key immune genes and cytokines, show bimodal variation in both transcript abundance and splicing patterns. This variation reflects differences in both cell state and usage of an interferon-driven pathway involving Stat2 and Irf7. Gene expression profiles are typically derived at cell-population level, yet there is growing evidence to suggest that seemingly identical individual cells can differ considerably in their gene expression. This paper describes the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to analyse the transcriptional response of 18 mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The authors find that even genes that are highly expressed at the population level — such as key immune genes and cytokines — are often bimodally expressed. They may be very highly expressed in one cell, and expressed hardly at all in another. This variation reflects differences in both cell state and usage of an interferon-driven pathway involving Stat2 and Irf7. The SMART-Seq technology used here could have wide application in the study of regulatory circuits at the single-cell level. Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output1,2,3,4,5, with important functional consequences4,5. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs1,2 or proteins5,6 simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods3 could not be applied to single cells until very recently7,8,9,10. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2061261019,"Osteoarthritis is a highly prevalent and debilitating joint disorder. There is no effective medical therapy for the condition because of limited understanding of its pathogenesis. We show that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is activated in subchondral bone in response to altered mechanical loading in an anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) mouse model of osteoarthritis. TGF-β1 concentrations are also high in subchondral bone from humans with osteoarthritis. High concentrations of TGF-β1 induced formation of nestin-positive mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) clusters, leading to formation of marrow osteoid islets accompanied by high levels of angiogenesis. We found that transgenic expression of active TGF-β1 in osteoblastic cells induced osteoarthritis, whereas inhibition of TGF-β activity in subchondral bone attenuated the degeneration of articular cartilage. In particular, knockout of the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) in nestin-positive MSCs led to less development of osteoarthritis relative to wild-type mice after ACLT. Thus, high concentrations of active TGF-β1 in subchondral bone seem to initiate the pathological changes of osteoarthritis, and inhibition of this process could be a potential therapeutic approach to treating this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2129530584,"Reprogramming somatic cells into pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been envisioned as an approach for generating patient-matched nuclear transfer (NT)-ESCs for studies of disease mechanisms and for developing specific therapies. Past attempts to produce human NT-ESCs have failed secondary to early embryonic arrest of SCNT embryos. Here, we identified premature exit from meiosis in human oocytes and suboptimal activation as key factors that are responsible for these outcomes. Optimized SCNT approaches designed to circumvent these limitations allowed derivation of human NT-ESCs. When applied to premium quality human oocytes, NT-ESC lines were derived from as few as two oocytes. NT-ESCs displayed normal diploid karyotypes and inherited their nuclear genome exclusively from parental somatic cells. Gene expression and differentiation profiles in human NT-ESCs were similar to embryo-derived ESCs, suggesting efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state."

https://openalex.org/W2102517059,"Cell-cell communication is an important mechanism for information exchange promoting cell survival for the control of features such as population density and differentiation. We determined that Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells directly communicate between parasites within a population using exosome-like vesicles that are capable of delivering genes. Importantly, communication via exosome-like vesicles promotes differentiation to sexual forms at a rate that suggests that signaling is involved. Furthermore, we have identified a P. falciparum protein, PfPTP2, that plays a key role in efficient communication. This study reveals a previously unidentified pathway of P. falciparum biology critical for survival in the host and transmission to mosquitoes. This identifies a pathway for the development of agents to block parasite transmission from the human host to the mosquito."
https://openalex.org/W1992894543,"Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) are among the most enigmatic of human malignancies. These aggressive salivary gland cancers frequently recur and metastasize despite definitive treatment, with no known effective chemotherapy regimen. Here we determined the ACC mutational landscape and report the exome or whole-genome sequences of 60 ACC tumor-normal pairs. These analyses identified a low exonic somatic mutation rate (0.31 non-silent events per megabase) and wide mutational diversity. Notably, we found mutations in genes encoding chromatin-state regulators, such as SMARCA2, CREBBP and KDM6A, suggesting that there is aberrant epigenetic regulation in ACC oncogenesis. Mutations in genes central to the DNA damage response and protein kinase A signaling also implicate these processes. We observed MYB-NFIB translocations and somatic mutations in MYB-associated genes, solidifying the role of these aberrations as critical events in ACC. Lastly, we identified recurrent mutations in the FGF-IGF-PI3K pathway (30% of tumors) that might represent new avenues for therapy. Collectively, our observations establish a molecular foundation for understanding and exploring new treatments for ACC."
https://openalex.org/W1992480897,"There is no generally accepted account of the function of the second visual cortical area (V2), partly because no simple response properties robustly distinguish V2 neurons from those in primary visual cortex (V1). We constructed synthetic stimuli replicating the higher-order statistical dependencies found in natural texture images and used them to stimulate macaque V1 and V2 neurons. Most V2 cells responded more vigorously to these textures than to control stimuli lacking naturalistic structure; V1 cells did not. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements in humans revealed differences between V1 and V2 that paralleled the neuronal measurements. The ability of human observers to detect naturalistic structure in different types of texture was well predicted by the strength of neuronal and fMRI responses in V2 but not in V1. Together, these results reveal a particular functional role for V2 in the representation of natural image structure."
https://openalex.org/W2096331437,"Signals from the tumor microenvironment trigger cancer cells to adopt an invasive phenotype through epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Relatively little is known regarding key signal transduction pathways that serve as cytosolic bridges between cell surface receptors and nuclear transcription factors to induce EMT. A better understanding of these early EMT events may identify potential targets for the control of metastasis. One rapid intracellular signaling pathway that has not yet been explored during EMT induction is calcium. Here we show that stimuli used to induce EMT produce a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels in human breast cancer cells. Attenuation of the calcium signal by intracellular calcium chelation significantly reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and hypoxia-induced EMT. Intracellular calcium chelation also inhibited EGF-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), while preserving other signal transduction pathways such as Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. To identify calcium-permeable channels that may regulate EMT induction in breast cancer cells, we performed a targeted siRNA-based screen. We found that transient receptor potential-melastatin-like 7 (TRPM7) channel expression regulated EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and expression of the EMT marker vimentin. Although intracellular calcium chelation almost completely blocked the induction of many EMT markers, including vimentin, Twist and N-cadherin, the effect of TRPM7 silencing was specific for vimentin protein expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. These results indicate that TRPM7 is a partial regulator of EMT in breast cancer cells, and that other calcium-permeable ion channels are also involved in calcium-dependent EMT induction. In summary, this work establishes an important role for the intracellular calcium signal in the induction of EMT in human breast cancer cells. Manipulation of calcium-signaling pathways controlling EMT induction in cancer cells may therefore be an important therapeutic strategy for preventing metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2018521012,"B Cell Tug of War High-affinity, protective antibodies made by B cells are critical for providing long-term protection against reinfection. In order to produce antibodies, B cells must first bind to and extract antigens from the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Using an in vitro system that allows B cells to bind to antigenladen, flexible membranes, Natkanski et al. (p. 1587 , published online 16 May) show that antigen extraction relies on myosin IIA–mediated contractile forces that pull upon the antigen-presenting membrane. These forces break the antigen-receptor bonds if affinity is low, thus ensuring that B cells only extract, internalize, and presumably respond to, high-affinity antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2094654932,"Acetylation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB at lysine-310 regulates the transcriptional activation of NF-κB target genes and contributes to maintaining constitutively active NF-κB in tumors. Bromodomain-containing factor Brd4 has been shown to bind to acetylated lysine-310 (AcLys310) and to regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, but the role of this binding in maintaining constitutively active NF-κB in tumors remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the structural basis for the binding of bromodomains (BDs) of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) to AcLys310 and identify the BD inhibitor JQ1 as an effective small molecule to block this interaction. JQ1 suppresses TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent target gene expression. In addition, JQ1 inhibits the proliferation and transformation potential of A549 lung cancer cells and suppresses the tumorigenicity of A549 cells in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of Brd4 or treatment of cells with JQ1 induces the ubiquitination and degradation of the constitutively active nuclear form of RelA. Our results identify a novel function of Brd4 in maintaining the persistently active form of NF-κB found in tumors, and they suggest that interference with the interaction between acetylated RelA and Brd4 could be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of NF-κB-driven cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2146945120,"Odor stimulation evokes complex spatiotemporal activity in the olfactory bulb, suggesting that both the identity of activated neurons and the timing of their activity convey information about odors. However, whether and how downstream neurons decipher these temporal patterns remains unknown. We addressed this question by measuring the spiking activity of downstream neurons while optogenetically stimulating two foci in the olfactory bulb with varying relative timing in mice. We found that the overall spike rates of piriform cortex neurons (PCNs) were sensitive to the relative timing of activation. Posterior PCNs showed higher sensitivity to relative input times than neurons in the anterior piriform cortex. In contrast, olfactory bulb neurons rarely showed such sensitivity. Thus, the brain can transform a relative time code in the periphery into a firing rate-based representation in central brain areas, providing evidence for the relevance of a relative time-based code in the olfactory bulb."

We present a peptide library and data resource of >100,000 synthetic, unmodified peptides and their phosphorylated counterparts with known sequences and phosphorylation sites. Analysis of the library by mass spectrometry yielded a data set that we used to evaluate the merits of different search engines (Mascot and Andromeda) and fragmentation methods (beam-type collision-induced dissociation (HCD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD)) for peptide identification. We also compared the sensitivities and accuracies of phosphorylation-site localization tools (Mascot Delta Score, PTM score and phosphoRS), and we characterized the chromatographic behavior of peptides in the library. We found that HCD identified more peptides and phosphopeptides than did ETD, that phosphopeptides generally eluted later from reversed-phase columns and were easier to identify than unmodified peptides and that current computational tools for proteomics can still be substantially improved. These peptides and spectra will facilitate the development, evaluation and improvement of experimental and computational proteomic strategies, such as separation techniques and the prediction of retention times and fragmentation patterns."

As a result, the fine-scale stratigraphy of the sediments has been used to infer changes in global sea level through the Cenozoic. However, recent work has shown that the coastal plain has deformed in response to flow in Earth's mantle. Rowley et al.

https://openalex.org/W2041366584,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are sarcomas of Schwann cell lineage origin that occur sporadically or in association with the inherited syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1. To identify genetic drivers of MPNST development, we used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based somatic mutagenesis system in mice with somatic loss of transformation-related protein p53 (Trp53) function and/or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Common insertion site (CIS) analysis of 269 neurofibromas and 106 MPNSTs identified 695 and 87 sites with a statistically significant number of recurrent transposon insertions, respectively. Comparison to human data sets identified new and known driver genes for MPNST formation at these sites. Pairwise co-occurrence analysis of CIS-associated genes identified many cooperating mutations that are enriched in Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and growth factor receptor signaling pathways. Lastly, we identified several new proto-oncogenes, including Foxr2 (encoding forkhead box R2), which we functionally validated as a proto-oncogene involved in MPNST maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2011780255,"RAF kinases have a prominent role in cancer. Their mode of activation is complex but critically requires dimerization of their kinase domains. Unexpectedly, several ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors were recently found to promote dimerization and transactivation of RAF kinases in a RAS-dependent manner and, as a result, undesirably stimulate RAS/ERK pathway-mediated cell growth. The mechanism by which these inhibitors induce RAF kinase domain dimerization remains unclear. Here we describe bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors for the extended RAF family that enable the detection of RAF dimerization in living cells. Notably, we demonstrate the utility of these tools for profiling kinase inhibitors that selectively modulate RAF dimerization and for probing structural determinants of RAF dimerization in vivo. Our findings, which seem generalizable to other kinase families allosterically regulated by kinase domain dimerization, suggest a model whereby ATP-competitive inhibitors mediate RAF dimerization by stabilizing a rigid closed conformation of the kinase domain."
https://openalex.org/W2067324617,"Inducing immune tolerance to prevent rejection is a key step toward successful engraftment of stem-cell-derived tissue in a clinical setting. Using human pluripotent stem cells to generate thymic epithelial cells (TECs) capable of supporting T cell development represents a promising approach to reach this goal; however, progress toward generating functional TECs has been limited. Here, we describe a robust in vitro method to direct differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into thymic epithelial progenitors (TEPs) by precise regulation of TGFβ, BMP4, RA, Wnt, Shh, and FGF signaling. The hESC-derived TEPs further mature into functional TECs that support T cell development upon transplantation into thymus-deficient mice. Importantly, the engrafted TEPs produce T cells capable of in vitro proliferation as well as in vivo immune responses. Thus, hESC-derived TEP grafts may have broad applications for enhancing engraftment in cell-based therapies as well as restoring age- and stress-related thymic decline."
https://openalex.org/W2135200515,"Innate sensing mechanisms trigger a variety of humoral and cellular events that are essential to adaptive immune responses. Here we describe an innate sensing pathway triggered by Plasmodium infection that regulates dendritic cell homeostasis and adaptive immunity through Flt3 ligand (Flt3l) release. Plasmodium-induced Flt3l release in mice requires Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and type I interferon (IFN) production. We found that type I IFN supports the upregulation of xanthine dehydrogenase, which metabolizes the xanthine accumulating in infected erythrocytes to uric acid. Uric acid crystals trigger mast cells to release soluble Flt3l from a pre-synthesized membrane-associated precursor. During infection, Flt3l preferentially stimulates expansion of the CD8-α(+) dendritic cell subset or its BDCA3(+) human dendritic cell equivalent and has a substantial impact on the magnitude of T cell activation, mostly in the CD8(+) compartment. Our findings highlight a new mechanism that regulates dendritic cell homeostasis and T cell responses to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2157848016,"In this study, the authors use selective silencing of specific subsets of afferent neurons and stimulation with pruritogens or algogens to show that histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch is mediated by functionally distinct sets of sensory fibers. These findings provide further evidence for the labeled line theory of sensory perception. The peripheral terminals of primary sensory neurons detect histamine and non-histamine itch-provoking ligands through molecularly distinct transduction mechanisms. It remains unclear, however, whether these distinct pruritogens activate the same or different afferent fibers. Using a strategy of reversibly silencing specific subsets of murine pruritogen-sensitive sensory axons by targeted delivery of a charged sodium-channel blocker, we found that functional blockade of histamine itch did not affect the itch evoked by chloroquine or SLIGRL-NH2, and vice versa. Notably, blocking itch-generating fibers did not reduce pain-associated behavior. However, silencing TRPV1+ or TRPA1+ neurons allowed allyl isothiocyanate or capsaicin, respectively, to evoke itch, implying that certain peripheral afferents may normally indirectly inhibit algogens from eliciting itch. These findings support the presence of functionally distinct sets of itch-generating neurons and suggest that targeted silencing of activated sensory fibers may represent a clinically useful anti-pruritic therapeutic approach for histaminergic and non-histaminergic pruritus."

https://openalex.org/W2078025753,"Mammalian somatic cells can be directly reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by introducing defined sets of transcription factors. Somatic cell reprogramming involves epigenomic reconfiguration, conferring iPSCs with characteristics similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Human ESCs (hESCs) contain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is generated through the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine by the TET enzyme family. Here we show that 5hmC levels increase significantly during reprogramming to human iPSCs mainly owing to TET1 activation, and this hydroxymethylation change is critical for optimal epigenetic reprogramming, but does not compromise primed pluripotency. Compared with hESCs, we find that iPSCs tend to form large-scale (100 kb–1.3 Mb) aberrant reprogramming hotspots in subtelomeric regions, most of which exhibit incomplete hydroxymethylation on CG sites. Strikingly, these 5hmC aberrant hotspots largely coincide (∼ 80%) with aberrant iPSC–ESC non-CG methylation regions. Our results suggest that TET1-mediated 5hmC modification could contribute to the epigenetic variation of iPSCs and iPSC–hESC differences. Human embryonic stem cells contain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) generated by the TET enzyme. Jin and colleagues show that TET1 increases 5hmC levels during reprogramming to human inducible pluripotent stem cells, and although this change is critical for optimal epigenetic reprogramming, it does not compromise primed pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2020544893,"Eukaryotic Ca(2+) regulation involves sequestration into intracellular organelles, and expeditious Ca(2+) release into the cytosol is a hallmark of key signalling transduction pathways. Bulk removal of Ca(2+) after such signalling events is accomplished by members of the Ca(2+):cation (CaCA) superfamily. The CaCA superfamily includes the Na(+)/Ca(2+) (NCX) and Ca(2+)/H(+) (CAX) antiporters, and in mammals the NCX and related proteins constitute families SLC8 and SLC24, and are responsible for the re-establishment of Ca(2+) resting potential in muscle cells, neuronal signalling and Ca(2+) reabsorption in the kidney. The CAX family members maintain cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis in plants and fungi during steep rises in intracellular Ca(2+) due to environmental changes, or following signal transduction caused by events such as hyperosmotic shock, hormone response and response to mating pheromones. The cytosol-facing conformations within the CaCA superfamily are unknown, and the transport mechanism remains speculative. Here we determine a crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar Ca(2+)/H(+) exchanger (Vcx1) at 2.3 Å resolution in a cytosol-facing, substrate-bound conformation. Vcx1 is the first structure, to our knowledge, within the CAX family, and it describes the key cytosol-facing conformation of the CaCA superfamily, providing the structural basis for a novel alternating access mechanism by which the CaCA superfamily performs high-throughput Ca(2+) transport across membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2099334477,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical for angiogenesis, but also has pleiotropic effects on several nonvascular cells. Our aim was to investigate the role of VEGF in brown adipose tissue (BAT). We show that VEGF expression increases 2.5-fold during differentiation of cultured murine brown adipocytes and that VEGF receptor-2 is phosphorylated, indicating VEGF signaling. VEGF increased proliferation in brown preadipocytes in vitro by 70%, and blockade of VEGF signaling using anti-VEGFR2 antibody DC101 increased brown adipocyte apoptosis, as determined by cell number and activation of caspase 3. Systemic VEGF neutralization in mice, accomplished by adenoviral expression of soluble Flt1, resulted in 7-fold increase in brown adipocyte apoptosis, mitochondrial degeneration, and increased mitophagy compared to control mice expressing a null adenovirus. Absence of the heparan sulfate-binding VEGF isoforms, VEGF164 and VEGF188, resulted in abnormal BAT development in mice at E15.5, with fewer brown adipocytes and lower mitochondrial protein compared to wild-type littermates. These results suggest a role for VEGF in brown adipocytes and preadipocytes to promote survival, proliferation, and normal mitochondria and development."

Pygopus 2 (Pygo2) is a histone methylation reader and a context-dependent Wnt/β-catenin coactivator. Here we provide evidence for Pygo2’s function in suppressing luminal/alveolar differentiation of MaSC-enriched basal cells. We show that Pygo2-deficient MaSC/basal cells exhibit partial molecular resemblance to luminal cells, such as elevated Notch signaling and reduced mammary repopulating capability upon transplantation. Inhibition of Notch signaling suppresses basal-level and Pygo2-deficiency-induced luminal/alveolar differentiation of MaSC/basal cells, whereas activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling suppresses luminal/alveolar differentiation and Notch3 expression in a Pygo2-dependent manner. We show that Notch3 is a direct target of Pygo2 and that Pygo2 is required for β-catenin binding and maintenance of a poised/repressed chromatin state at the Notch3 locus in MaSC/basal cells. Together, our data support a model where Pygo2-mediated chromatin regulation connects Wnt signaling and Notch signaling to restrict the luminal/alveolar differentiation competence of MaSC/basal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2069484614,"Abnormalities in how pulmonary veins connect to the heart underlie a type of congenital heart disease. Jonathan Epstein and his colleagues show that this condition, termed anomalous pulmonary venous connections, can be caused by mutation of the gene encoding the guidance protein semaphorin 3d and show how this protein acts in the embryo to pattern the developing pulmonary veins. Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a potentially lethal congenital disorder that occurs when the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium, allowing mixing of pulmonary and systemic blood1. In contrast to the extensive knowledge of arterial vascular patterning, little is known about the patterning of veins. Here we show that the secreted guidance molecule semaphorin 3d (Sema3d) is crucial for the normal patterning of pulmonary veins. Prevailing models suggest that TAPVC occurs when the midpharyngeal endothelial strand (MES), the precursor of the common pulmonary vein, does not form at the proper location on the dorsal surface of the embryonic common atrium2,3. However, we found that TAPVC occurs in Sema3d mutant mice despite normal formation of the MES. In these embryos, the maturing pulmonary venous plexus does not anastomose uniquely with the properly formed MES. In the absence of Sema3d, endothelial tubes form in a region that is normally avascular, resulting in aberrant connections. Normally, Sema3d provides a repulsive cue to endothelial cells in this area, establishing a boundary. Sequencing of SEMA3D in individuals with anomalous pulmonary veins identified a phenylalanine-to-leucine substitution that adversely affects SEMA3D function. These results identify Sema3d as a crucial pulmonary venous patterning cue and provide experimental evidence for an alternate developmental model to explain abnormal pulmonary venous connections."
https://openalex.org/W2043794272,"Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands have been implicated in neuronal development and neovascularization. Overexpression of ephrin-A1 has been implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms are not clear. Here, we report a role of the Eph/ephrin system in a cell adhesion mechanism. Clustered erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A1 (EphA1)/ephrin-A1 complexes on the plasma membrane did not undergo endocytosis, and the cell remained adherent to one another. The cell–cell contacts were maintained in an Eph tyrosine kinase activity-independent manner even in the absence of E-cadherin. EphA1 and ephrin-A1 co-localized in pulmonary endothelial cells, and regulated vascular permeability and metastasis in the lungs. We identified ADAM12 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12) as an EphA1-binding partner by yeast two-hybrid screening and found that ADAM12 enhanced ephrin-A1 cleavage in response to transforming growth factor-β1 in primary tumors. Released soluble ephrin-A1 in the serum deteriorated the EphA1/ephrin-A1-mediated cell adhesion in the lungs in an endocrine manner, causing lung hyperpermeability that facilitated tumor cell entry into the lungs. Depletion of soluble ephrin-A1 by its neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited lung metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2049460097,"Tumor suppressors with extracellular function are likely to have advantages as targets for cancer therapy, but few are known. Here, we focused on angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), which is a secreted glycoprotein involved in lipoprotein metabolism and angiogenesis, is methylation-silenced in human cancers, but has unclear roles in cancer development and progression. We found a deletion mutation in its coiled-coil domain at its N-terminal in human gastric cancers, in addition to hypermethylation of the ANGPTL4 promoter CpG islands. Forced expression of wild-type ANGPTL4, but not ANGPTL4 with the deletion, at physiological levels markedly suppressed in vivo tumorigenicity and tumor angiogenesis, indicating that the latter caused the former. Tumor-derived ANGPTL4 suppressed in vitro vascular tube formation and proliferation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, partly due to suppression of ERK signaling. These showed that ANGPTL4 is a genetically and epigenetically inactivated secreted tumor suppressor that inhibits tumor angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2006437070,"Profilin1 (Pfn1), a ubiquitously expressed actin-binding protein, has an indispensable role in migration and proliferation of normal cells. Seemingly contrary to its essential cellular functions, Pfn1's expression is downregulated in breast cancer, the significance of which is unclear. In this study, expression profiling of Pfn1 in human breast cancer specimens correlates lower Pfn1 expression levels with propensity to metastasize. Xenograft experiments further establish a causal relationship between loss of Pfn1 expression and increased dissemination of breast cancer cells (BCCs) from the primary mammary tumor. BCCs exhibit a hyperinvasive phenotype (marked by matrix metalloproteinase-9 upregulation, faster invasion through collagen matrix) and acquire increased proficiency to transmigrate through endothelial barrier (an obligatory step for vascular dissemination) when Pfn1 expression is suppressed. In Pfn1-deficient cells, hyperinvasiveness involves a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-PI(3,4)P2 signaling axis while augmented transendothelial migration occurs in a vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent manner. Contrasting these dissemination promoting activities, loss of Pfn1, however, dramatically inhibits metastatic outgrowth of disseminated BCCs, suggesting that Pfn1 has a key role in the metastatic colonization process. In summary, this study shows that Pfn1 has a dichotomous role in early vs late steps of breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2080823574,"Targeted inhibition of Hedgehog signaling at the cell membrane has been associated with anticancer activity in preclinical and early clinical studies. Hedgehog signaling involves activation of Gli transcription factors that can also be induced by alternative pathways. In this study, we identified an interaction between Gli proteins and a transcription coactivator TBP-associated factor 9 (TAF9), and validated its functional relevance in regulating Gli transactivation. We also describe a novel, synthetic small molecule, FN1-8, that efficiently interferes with Gli/TAF9 interaction and downregulate Gli/TAF9-dependent transcriptional activity. More importantly, FN1-8 suppresses cancer cell proliferation in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our results suggest that blocking Gli transactivation, an important control point of multiple oncogenic pathways, may be an effective anticancer strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2040921271,"Promoter CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is an epigenetic hallmark of human cancer commonly associated with nucleosome occupancy and the transcriptional silencing of the neighboring gene. Nucleosomes can determine the underlying DNA methylation status. Herein, we show that the opposite is also true: DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning. Using a cancer model and digital nucleosome positioning techniques, we demonstrate that the induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Most importantly, the establishment of a stable cell line that restores DNMT1/DNMT3B deficiency shows that nucleosomes reoccupy their positions in de novo methylated CpG islands. Finally, we extend these results to the genomic level, combining a DNA methylation microarray and the nucleosome positioning technique. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other."

https://openalex.org/W2030052939,"Increasing evidence suggests that brain tumors arise from the transformation of neural stem/precursor/progenitor cells. Much current research on human brain tumors is focused on the stem-like properties of glioblastoma. Here we show that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and its ligand pleiotrophin are required for the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Furthermore, we demonstrate that pleiotrophin is transactivated directly by SOX2, a transcription factor essential for the maintenance of both neural stem cells and GSCs. We speculate that the pleiotrophin-ALK axis may be a promising target for the therapy of glioblastoma."

https://openalex.org/W2149007591,"Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a key component in lipid metabolism and signaling. Previous model membrane studies using DAG analogs suggest their rapid membrane transbilayer movement. However, little is known about the DAG distribution and dynamics in cell membranes. Using live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we monitored the transbilayer movement of DAG with the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged C1AB domain from protein kinase C-γ (EYFP-C1AB), which selectively binds DAG. When HeLa cells were treated with Bacillus cereus phospholipase C (Bc-PLC) to produce DAG on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, intracellularly expressed EYFP-C1AB probe accumulated at the plasma membrane, indicating the transbilayer movement of the outer leaflet DAG to the inner leaflet. This Bc-PLC-induced translocation of EYFP-C1AB probe to the plasma membrane was not observed in the sphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, but was recovered after cell treatment with sphingomyelinase or preincubation with an inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis. The inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin (SM) on the transbilayer movement of DAG was reproduced in model membranes using a fluorescent short-chain DAG analog. These results demonstrate that the SM content on the outer leaflet regulates the transbilayer movement of DAG in the plasma membrane, thus providing new insights into the dynamics of DAG in cell pathophysiology.—Ueda, Y., Makino, A., Murase-Tamada, K., Sakai, S., Inaba, T., Hullin-Matsuda, F., Kobayashi, T., Sphingomyelin regulates the transbilayer movement of diacylglycerol in the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.

https://openalex.org/W2040314893,"Interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokines such as IL-6, oncostatin M (OSM) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signal through receptor complexes that are critically dependent on gp130. The latter is the common signal-transducing molecule that couples these cytokines to their downstream effectors, Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). IL-6-type cytokine signalling additionally involves the recruitment and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2. Both STATs and ERKs regulate responses mediated by members of the IL-6 family. Here, we show that ERK2, but not ERK1, also controls the expression and function of gp130 per se, as silencing ERK2 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells inhibits the expression of gp130. This does not simply reflect quantitative differences between ERK1 and ERK2, and the effects are not restricted to osteosarcoma cells, as they can be extended to several other cancer cell types analysed to date (such as breast, prostate, lung and cervical cancer cells). Importantly, ERK2 binds to the GP130 promoter, where it perhaps interacts with the transcriptional machinery. Indeed, its role in the transcriptional regulation of the GP130 gene was corroborated using luciferase reporter assays and messenger RNA stability experiments. Considering the pivotal role that gp130 has in cancer and inflammation these data thus identify novel non-overlapping functions for ERK1 and ERK2 that are biologically relevant."
https://openalex.org/W2082613563,"Tumor progression is associated with invasiveness and metastatic potential. The special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) has been identified as a key factor in the progression of breast cancer cells to a malignant phenotype and is associated with progression of human tumors. In normal development, SATB1 coordinates gene expression of progenitor cells by functioning as a genome organizer. In contrast to progenitor and tumor cells, SATB1 expression in nontransformed cells is not compatible with proliferation. Here we show that SATB1 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts induces cell cycle arrest and senescence that is associated with elevated p16 protein levels. Deletion of p16 overcomes the SATB1-induced senescence. We further provide evidence for an interaction of SATB1 with the retinoblastoma (RB)/E2F pathway downstream of p16. A combined deletion of the RB proteins, RB, p107 and p130 (triple-mutant; TM), prevents SATB1-induced G1 arrest, which is restored upon the reintroduction of RB into SATB1-expressing TM fibroblasts. SATB1 interacts with the E2F/RB complex and regulates the cyclin E promoter in an E2F-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that p16 and the RB/E2F pathway are critical for SATB1-induced cell cycle arrest. In the absence of p16, SATB1 causes anchorage-independent growth and invasive phenotype in fibroblasts. Our data illustrate that p16 mutations collaborate with the oncogenic activity of SATB1. Consistent with our finding, a literature survey shows that deletion of p16 is generally associated with SATB1 expressing human cell lines and tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2055011305,"Coordination of organ growth and metabolism in response to changing environmental conditions is essential for physiological homeostasis. A central metabolic control mechanism in multicellular organisms is insulin signaling. Under conditions of elevated blood sugar, insulin promotes the storage of glucose in tissues such as muscle, fat, and liver. Classically, the role of insulin signaling is systemic. In mammals, insulin is produced by pancreatic beta cells and released into the bloodstream in response to increased concentrations of blood glucose, inducing global changes in growth and metabolism. Intriguingly, recent studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling can also occur locally, over a short range. Why have local insulin signaling? Local signals allow organ-specific, rather than organismal responses to changing environmental conditions (see the figure). This allows the modulation of the growth and development of individual tissues to be separately controlled, and raises the question of whether this phenomenon could be exploited for therapeutic strategies. Many of these recent findings have arisen from research in invertebrates; however, there are striking parallels in mammals."
