https://openalex.org/W1978186903,"Mutants in the gene CDC34 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are defective in the transition from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. This gene was cloned and shown to encode a 295-residue protein that has substantial sequence similarity to the product of the yeast RAD6 gene. The RAD6 gene is required for a variety of cellular functions including DNA repair and was recently shown to encode a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. When produced in Escherichia coli, the CDC34 gene product catalyzed the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to histones H2A and H2B in vitro, demonstrating that the CDC34 protein is another distinct member of the family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The cell cycle function of CDC34 is thus likely to be mediated by the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of its product."
https://openalex.org/W2058855160,"The glucocorticoid receptor is a signal transducer that interacts both with the signal and with the genes it regulates. We showed previously that nuclear localization of the receptor requires hormone binding. We have now constructed recombinant receptors that relieve hormonal control of nuclear localization, and we demonstrate that the DNA binding/transcriptional regulatory functions of the receptor are also regulated directly by hormone. Surprisingly, regulation by the steroid binding domain appears to be relatively independent of protein structure. For example, regulation is maintained when the steroid binding region is repositioned from the C-terminus to the N-terminus of the receptor. Furthermore, the activity of an unrelated protein, the adenovirus E1A gene product, becomes hormone regulated upon fusion to the steroid binding domain. We speculate that the inhibitory effect of the unliganded steroid binding domain may be mediated by heat shock protein hsp90, which binds selectively to the unliganded receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2049621422,"We have purified a protein (TEF-1) that specifically binds to two sequence unrelated motifs (GT-IIC and Sph) of the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer. TEF-1 binds cooperatively to templates containing tandem but not inverted or spaced repeats of its cognate motifs. This cooperative binding correlates with the ability of the tandem repeats to generate enhancer activity in vivo. In contrast, TEF-1 and a second SV40 enhancer binding protein, TEF-2, bind independently to templates containing the cognate motifs of both proteins (GT-I and either GT-IIC or Sph motifs) even though these motifs cooperate in enhancer activity in vivo. These results allow us to distinguish different classes of enhancer factors."
https://openalex.org/W2019789451,"We describe here for the first time the isolation of a yeast nuclear scaffold that maintains specific interactions with yeast genomic DNA sequences. The scaffold-DNA interaction is reversible and saturable, and some binding sites are conserved between yeast and Drosophila KC cells. Second, we find that the specific sequences bound to the yeast nuclear scaffold are the putative origins of replication (ARS elements) and a chromosomal centromere, CENIII. The scaffold association has been closely mapped at the ARS1 locus, and appears to include the 11 bp ARS consensus, but not the ABF-1 binding site. Competition studies show that ARS1 does not compete for CENIII binding, allowing us to distinguish two classes of scaffold attachment sites by functional and structural criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2016103382,"We have investigated the cell-specific activity of the GT-IIC, GT-I, Sph-II, Sph-I, and octamer motifs of the SV40 enhancer in four cell lines (HeLa cells, MPC11 plasmocytoma B cells, and non-differentiated and retinoic acid-differentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells). Our present results reveal the existence of three classes of motifs that interact with cell-specific enhancer factors but that have no enhancer activity of their own: those (class A) that generate enhancer activity following oligomerization of tandem repeats of the motif; those (class B) that cannot enhance transcription when oligomerized as a tandem repeat but whose association with a second motif results in transcription activation after oligomerization; and those (class C) that exhibit enhancer activity when a single copy of the motif is oligomerized. Three levels of functional organization of enhancers can also be defined. The possible implications for enhancer functions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1973643623,"Yeast Ty1 elements are retrotransposons that transpose via an RNA intermediate found in a virus-like particle (Ty-VLP). A Ty-encoded reverse transcriptase activity found inside the particles is capable of giving rise to full-length reverse transcripts. The predominant form of these reverse transcripts is a full-length linear duplex DNA. We have developed a cell-free system for transposition of Ty1 DNA molecules into a bacteriophage lambda target. Purified Ty-VLPs and target DNA are the only macromolecular components required for the transposition reaction. A TYB-encoded protein, p90-TYB, contains amino acid sequences that are similar to those of retroviral integrase proteins. Mutations in the integrase coding region abolish transposition both in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2070336844,"We have isolated large amounts of E. coli outer-membrane protein A precursor (proOmpA). Purified proOmpA is active in membrane assembly, and this assembly is saturable with respect to the precursor protein. A proOmpA-Sepharose matrix allows affinity isolation of trigger factor, a soluble, 63,000 dalton monomeric protein that stabilizes proOmpA in assembly competent form. Comparison of trigger factor's amino-terminal sequence with those in a computer data bank and with those encoded by sec genes, as well as groEL and heat shock gene dnaK, suggests that trigger factor is encoded by a previously undescribed gene. Trigger factor and proOmpA form a 1:1 complex that can be isolated by gel filtration. Purified canine signal recognition particle (SRP) can also stabilize proOmpA for membrane insertion. This postribosomal activity of SRP suggests a unifying theme in protein translocation mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1557336515,"A topoisomerase has been purified from extracts of a topoisomerase I-deficient strain of Escherichia coli based solely on its ability to segregate pBR322 DNA replication intermediates in vitro. This enzyme rapidly decatenated multiply linked form II:form II DNA dimers to form II DNA, provided that the DNA substrate contained single-stranded regions. Efficient relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA was observed when reaction mixtures were incubated at 52 degrees C, but not at 30 degrees C (the temperature at which decatenation was readily observed). This topoisomerase was insensitive to the DNA gyrase inhibitor norfloxacin and unaffected by antibody directed against topoisomerase I. Relaxation of a unique plasmid topoisomer revealed that this decatenase changed the linking number of the DNA in steps of one and was therefore a type 1 topoisomerase. The cleavage pattern of a fragment of single-stranded phi X174 DNA generated by this decatenase was virtually identical to that reported for topoisomerase III, the least characterized topoisomerase present in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W2093101342,Human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) consists of two distinct but related polypeptide chains designated PDGF-A and PDGF-B. The gene encoding PDGF-B has given rise to the v-sis oncogene. In the present study the transforming activities of PDGF-A and PDGF-B genes are compared. The PDGF-A chain gene is markedly less efficient in inducing transformation than the PDGF-B gene under the influence of the same promoter. There are significant differences in the secretory and growth stimulating properties of the two chains. These properties appear to account for the much more potent transforming ability of the PDGF-B gene. These findings provide insights into biologic properties of a growth factor responsible for potent autocrine stimulation of abnormal cell proliferation.
https://openalex.org/W2079446382,"The 40 kd lambda Integrase protein is shown to contain two autonomous DNA binding domains with different sequence specificities. Competition experiments in which the binding activity of Int is assayed through nuclease protection demonstrate the functional independence of the two DNA recognition specificities. Proteolytic cleavage of Int and footprinting analysis of the resulting two major peptides allow the physical separation and identification of two DNA binding domains: an amino-terminal peptide that interacts with “arm-type” sites and a carboxy-terminal peptide that binds to “core-type” sequences. In addition, the data suggest that the two domains can bind DNA simultaneously, consistent with a model in which Integrase would link two disparate DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1561488685,"A tumor-derived protein with a spectrum of biologic activities remarkably similar to that of parathyroid hormone (PTH) has recently been purified and its sequence deduced from cloned cDNA. This PTH-like protein (PLP) has substantial sequence homology with PTH only in the amino-terminal 1-13 region and shows little similarity to other regions of PTH thought to be important for binding to receptors. In the present study, we compared the actions of two synthetic PLP peptides, PLP-(1-34)amide and [Tyr36]PLP-(1-36)amide, with those of bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH)-(1-34) on receptors and adenylate cyclase in bone cells and in renal membranes. Synthetic PLP peptides were potent activators of adenylate cyclase in canine renal membranes (EC50 = 3.0 nM) and in UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells (EC50 = 0.05 nM). Bovine PTH-(1-34) was 6-fold more potent than the PLP peptides in renal membranes, but was 2-fold less potent in UMR-106 cells. A competitive PTH receptor antagonist, [Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)amide, rapidly and fully inhibited adenylate cyclase stimulation by the PLP peptides as well as bPTH-(1-34). Competitive binding experiments with 125I-labeled PLP peptides revealed the presence of high affinity PLP receptors in UMR-106 cells IC50 = 3-4 nM) and in renal membranes (IC50 = 0.3 nM). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of PLP receptors. Bovine PTH-(1-34) was equipotent with the PLP peptides in binding to PLP receptors. Likewise, PLP peptides and bPTH-(1-34) were equipotent in competing with 125I-bPTH-(1-34) for binding to PTH receptors in renal membranes. Photoaffinity cross-linking experiments revealed that PTH and PLP peptides both interact with a major 85-kDa and minor 55- and 130-kDa components of canine renal membranes. We conclude that PTH and PLP activate adenylate cyclase by binding to common receptors in bone and kidney. The results further imply that subtle differences exist between PTH and PLP peptides in their ability to induce receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling."

https://openalex.org/W1583574352,"The cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex is one of two terminal oxidases in the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli. The enzyme is located in the cytoplasmic membrane where it oxidizes ubiquinol-8 in the bilayer and reduces oxygen to water. Enzyme turnover is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force, resulting in electrogenic translocation across the membrane of one proton per electron passing through the system. The enzyme is an alpha beta heterodimer containing four hemes. The cyd locus, encoding both subunits, has previously been genetically mapped and cloned. This work describes an insertion and deletion analysis of cyd which indicates the direction of transcription, defines the coding regions, and suggests that cyd is an operon. In addition, the complete DNA sequence of the cyd gene is reported. Two open reading frames, separated by 18 base pairs, encode the two subunits of the oxidase complex. Hydropathy profiles of the deduced protein sequence indicate that subunits I and II are each likely to have multiple transmembrane elements. There are only 10 histidines in both subunits, several of which are likely to serve as heme axial ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1553415829,"The covalent ligation of the 8.6-kDa protein ubiquitin to histones within transcriptionally poised regions is believed to participate in the localized regulation of chromatin structure. This unique post-translational modification is thought to be distinct from similar cytosolic reactions in requiring ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and one or more putative ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2) but not isopeptide ligase (E3). Apparently homogeneous preparations of the E2 isozymes were tested for their ability to catalyze the E3-independent conjugation of ubiquitin to linker histone H1 and core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 in the presence of catalytic amounts of E1. Significant rates of nonprocessive core histone monoubiquitination were catalyzed by the E2(14kDa), E2(20kDa), and E2(32kDa) isozymes but not by either E2(17kDa) or E2(24kDa). The former three E2 isozymes also supported slow rates of direct multiple ubiquitination to secondary ligation sites on the histones. Rate studies for the monoubiquitination of H2A and H2B revealed that: 1) E2(14kDa) catalyzed a second order reaction with respect to histone concentration; 2) E2(32kDa)-mediated ligation proceeded by hyperbolic kinetics, yielding Km values of 2.8 and 12 microM for H2A and H2B, respectively; and 3) E2(20kDa) exhibited complex kinetics composed of both second order and hyperbolic pathways, the latter having Km values of 0.83 and 1.5 microM for H2A and H2B, respectively. Pulse-chase kinetics suggested that both ubiquitin thiol esters formed to E2(20kDa) were catalytically competent in H2A ligation. The active E2 isozymes also catalyzed the processive multiple ubiquitination of calf thymus H1. Other rate studies determined that Kd values for binding of the active E2 species to E1 ternary complex were 0.1 nM for E2(14kDa), 0.4 nM for E2(32kDa), and 3.6 nM for E2(20kDa). The data indicate that E2(20kDa) and E2(32kDa) are specific but mechanistically distinct ligation enzymes responsible for the conjugation of ubiquitin to nucleosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1607408464,"Pretreatment (priming) of neutrophils with a non-activating concentration (2 nM) of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) augments superoxide (O2-) production in response to the chemoattractant formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP). We initially examined the effect of sphinganine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), on activation of primed neutrophils. In both primed and unprimed cells activation by fMLP was blocked, and inhibition occurred at identical concentrations, supporting a common inhibited site. PMA also augmented (about 2-fold) fMLP-induced generation of sn-1,2-diglyceride (DG), the level of which correlated with O2- generation. In contrast to its effects on DG, PMA diminished by about 50% the magnitude of the fMLP-stimulated rise in cytosolic Ca2+. Thus, PMA priming dissociates the fMLP-stimulated Ca2+ increase from DG and O2- generation. The effect of PMA on Ca2+ levels appeared to be due in part to lowered levels of inositol trisphosphate. Lowering of inositol phosphate levels correlated with inhibition of fMLP-induced hydrolysis of inositol-containing phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. PMA did not inhibit (and in fact augmented at early time points) formation of [32P] phosphatidic acid in response to fMLP, indicating that the increase in DG was not due to inhibition of cellular diglyceride kinase. Thus, the data suggest that PMA enhances fMLP-stimulated DG generation concomitant with switching the source of DG from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to an alternative lipid(s). Increased DG and inhibition of activation by sphinganine are consistent with a role for protein kinase C in activation of the respiratory burst in PMA-primed neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1559048099,"Three distinct atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) receptors have been identified and characterized from rat thoracic aortic cultured vascular smooth muscle (RTASM) cells, kidney tubular epithelium (MDCK), and Leydig tumor (MA-10) cells. These include 1) a disulfide-linked 140-kDa protein found in RTASM cells, which was reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT) to 70 kDa, 2) a 120-135-kDa single polypeptide protein, specific to MDCK and MA-10 cells whose Mr was not reduced by DTT, and 3) a 66-70-kDa protein prevalent in both RTASM and MDCK cells, which was not reduced by DTT. After incubation of RTASM cells with 4-azidobenzoyl 125I-ANF, labeling of the 140-kDa protein was blocked by both full-length ANF(99-126) and truncated ANF103-123. In contrast, the labeling of the 120-kDa receptor in MDCK cells was blocked only by full-length ANF(99-126). However, labeling of the 68-70-kDa receptor in both RTASM and MDCK cells was blocked by full-length ANF(99-126) and truncated ANF(103-123). Binding of 125I-ANF(99-126) to RTASM and MDCK cells was rapid, specific, and saturable with a Kd of 1.5 x 10(-10) M and binding capacity (Bmax) of 2.1 x 10(5) sites/RTASM cell and Kd 4.5 x 10(-10) M and Bmax 5 x 10(4) sites/MDCK cell, respectively. Binding of 125I-ANF(99-126) to RTASM cells was displaced with both full-length ANF(99-126) and truncated ANF(103-123), however, binding to MDCK cells was efficiently displaced only with full-length ANF. Both ANF(99-126) and ANF(103-123) stimulated cGMP in RTASM cells but only ANF(99-126) elicited cGMP in MDCK cells. Tryptic proteolysis of the high Mr single chain receptor produced only a 68-kDa fragment, whereas disulfide-linked 140-kDa receptor yielded 52-, 38-, 26-, and 14-kDa fragments. These data provide direct biochemical evidence for three distinct ANF receptors which might be linked to diverse physiological functions of ANF such as natriuresis in the kidney, vasorelaxation in vascular smooth muscle, and steroidogenic responsiveness in Leydig cells."

https://openalex.org/W2159186971,"According to the allosteric three-site model for the ribosomal elongation cycle (Rheinberger, H.J. and Nierhaus, K.H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9133-9139), two types of A site (aminoacyl-tRNA site) occupation exist. First is the A site occupation after initiation (i-type), with only one site, the P site (peptidyl-tRNA site), being prefilled with a tRNA (initiator tRNA). Second is the A site occupation after an elongation cycle (e-type), with two prefilled sites, namely the P and E sites containing peptidyl-tRNA and deacylated tRNA, respectively. The individual reactions of the elongation cycle were tested, including both types of A site occupation in the presence of various antibiotics. A test system was used allowing the functional studies to be made with quantitative tRNA binding at 6 mM Mg2+. The following results were obtained: 1) thiostrepton (5 x 10(-6) M) induced a complete block of both EF-(elongation factor) G dependent and EF-G independent translocation, in agreement with older observations. The A-site occupation of the e-type was severely inhibited in contrast to that of the i-type. Thus, thiostrepton blocks the allosteric transitions in both directions, i.e. the transition from pre- to post-translocational state (translocation) and that from the post- to the pre-translocational state (A site occupation of the e-type). In addition the ribosomal binding of EF-G.[3H] GMPPNP was inhibited by about 60%. 2) Similarly, viomycin (5 x 10(-5) M) appears to be an inhibitor of both allosteric transitions, since it strongly inhibited the e-type (but not the i-type) A site occupation in addition to translocation. 3) The aminoglycosides streptomycin, hygromycin B, neomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin prevented A site occupation of the e-type (residual activity below 15%). Neomycin and hygromycin, in addition, blocked the translocation reaction. Only marginal effects were observed with A site occupation of the i-type. It appears that the inhibition of the A site binding of the e-type (allosteric transition from the post- to the pretranslocational state) is the predominant effect of the misreading-inducing aminoglycosides."
https://openalex.org/W1480410640,"Abstract The effect of ligand binding on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor conformation was examined using peptide antibodies directed against specific receptor domains. Antiserum 83, which was directed to the receptor's carboxyl terminus (residues 934-951), preferentially immunoprecipitated the ligand-activated form of the PDGF receptor from 35S-labeled BALB/c 3T3 cells. By contrast, two antisera directed against other receptor sequences precipitated unactivated and activated receptors equally well. Denatured receptors were recognized equally by all antisera, even 83. Thus, ligand activation caused a change in PDGF receptor conformation that enhanced accessibility of the antibody to the carboxyl terminus. The activated receptor conformation was induced by three different forms of PDGF (AA and BB homodimers and AB heterodimers) and was reversed by suramin, a polyanionic compound that dissociates PDGF from the receptor. The inhibitory effect of suramin on receptor conformation was abolished by the phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, suggesting that receptor phosphorylation mediated the conformational change. In a cell-free assay, the change in receptor conformation was induced by PDGF only in the presence of ATP and was inhibited by adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP. The functional significance of receptor conformation was examined in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts transfected with wild-type or mutated forms of the PDGF receptor. When receptor tyrosine kinase activity was abolished by a mutation of the ATP binding site the receptor no longer underwent PDGF-induced conformational change and did not mediate PDGF-induced mitogenesis even though 125I-PDGF binding was normal. These findings show that ligand binding elicits a phosphorylation-dependent change in PDGF receptor conformation that may be important for receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2089475356,"When two different mammalian cell types are fused to generate a stable hybrid cell line, genes that are active in only one of the parents are frequently shut off, a phenomenon called extinction. In this study two distinct, complementary mechanisms for such extinction of growth hormone gene expression were identified. In hybrids formed by fusing fibroblasts to pituitary cells, pituitary-specific proteins that bind to the growth hormone promoter were absent. In addition, a negative regulatory element located near the rat growth hormone promoter was specifically activated."
https://openalex.org/W1490106236,"Modification of the cholesterol content of highly purified cardiac sarcolemma from dog ventricles was accomplished by incubation with phosphatidylcholine liposomes containing various amounts of cholesterol. The degree of cholesterol enrichment could be varied by changing the liposomal cholesterol/phospholipid ratio or varying the liposome-membrane incubation time. Na+-Ca2+ exchange measured in cholesterol-enriched sarcolemmal vesicles was increased up to 48% over control values. The stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange was associated with an increased affinity of the exchanger for Ca2+ (Km = 17 microM compared with Km = 22 microM for control preparations). Na+-Ca2+ exchange measured in cholesterol-depleted membrane preparations was decreased by 15%. This depressed activity was associated with a decreased affinity of the exchanger for Ca2+ (Km = 27 microM). These changes were not due to either a change in membrane permeability to Ca2+ or an increase in the amount of Ca2+ bound to sarcolemmal vesicles. The stimulating effect of cholesterol enrichment was specific to the Na+-Ca2+ exchange process since sarcolemmal Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase activity was depressed 40% by cholesterol enrichment. Further, K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase and Na+-K+ ATPase activities were depressed in both cholesterol-depleted and cholesterol-enriched sarcolemmal vesicles. In situ oxidation of membrane cholesterol completely eliminated Na+-Ca2+ exchange. These results suggest that cholesterol is intimately associated with Na+-Ca2+ exchange and may interact with the exchange protein and modulate its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1607715402,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and alpha-thrombin can stimulate DNA synthesis in Chinese hamster fibroblasts (CCL39) by two separate signaling pathways (Chambard, J.C., Paris, S., L'Allemain, G., and Pouyssegur, J. (1987) Nature 326, 800-803) but can also act synergistically. We have examined whether this synergism might depend upon changes in inositol lipid metabolism. Indeed, FGF, which has no effect on its own on phosphoinositide hydrolysis, potentiates (by up to 2-fold) thrombin-induced formation of inositol phosphates. This enhancing effect is also observed upon direct activation by AIF4- of the GTP-binding protein coupled to phospholipase C, and is best revealed when phospholipase C is weakly stimulated. With low thrombin concentrations or with AIF4-, the formation of inositol phosphates is immediately increased with a marked reduction of the initial lag, whereas at high thrombin concentrations, the stimulation by FGF becomes pronounced only after desensitization of phospholipase C to thrombin. FGF-induced potentiation is not mimicked by calcium ionophores, but is likewise elicited by epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and to a lesser extent by insulin, other growth factors known to activate receptor tyrosine kinases. We therefore propose that the tyrosine kinase-activating growth factors enhance the coupling between GTP-binding protein and phospholipase C, presumably through the phosphorylation of one of these two proteins. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin attenuates thrombin-induced phospholipase C activity but does not impede the potentiation by FGF. Comparison of the potentiating effects of FGF on inositol phosphate formation and on DNA synthesis suggests than an increased production of second messengers by the inositol lipid pathway in the first hours of stimulation might be, at least in part, responsible for the synergistic actions of FGF and thrombin on DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1593231964,"Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is actively involved in the control of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis as a physiological antagonist of the renin-angiotensin system. To evaluate a possible interaction between ANF and angiotensin II (Ang-II) receptors, we investigated the effect of long term pretreatment (18 h) of rat cultured vascular smooth muscle cells with Ang-II. Binding of 125I-labeled ANF and cyclic GMP production induced by ANF were measured. After preincubation of the cells with Ang-II (1, 10, and 100 nM), the number of ANF binding sites (Bmax) was decreased by 30, 59, and 71%, respectively, with a slight decrease of the Kd values. Sar1-Ile8-Ang-II (100 nM), a specific Ang-II receptor antagonist, totally inhibited the down-regulation induced by Ang-II (10 nM). Moreover, the regulatory effect of Ang-II on ANF receptors appeared more slowly as compared to ANF homologous receptor regulation. Ang-II pretreatment did not desensitize but increased cyclic GMP production elicited by ANF, implying that only the number of non-guanylate cyclase-coupled receptors was affected. These findings, which were not observed with 100 nM of epinephrine, norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin, and Arg-vasopressin, demonstrate a specific and functional link between ANF and Ang-II receptors. This study also shows that the regulation of ANF receptors is heterogeneous, providing new evidence of multiple classes of ANF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2146184051,"The OCT plasmid-localized alkBAC operon encodes enzymes for alkane hydroxylation and alkanol dehydrogenation. The positively controlled expression of the operon is very efficient in both Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. Two regulatory functions have been ascribed to the regulatory locus alkR: inducer recognition and transcriptional activation of the operon. We have cloned and localized the alkR locus on a 4.9-kilobase pair SalI fragment. The alkR region was analyzed for translation productions in E. coli minicells. Two proteins were identified: a 99- and a 48-kDa peptide. The positions of the cistrons encoding these proteins were established. Both cistrons were shown to be essential for an Alk phenotype. The first cistron (alkS), which encodes the 99-kDa protein, complemented alkR mutations affecting inducer specificity. Furthermore, we found that alkS is responsible for activation of expression of the alkBAC operon since it is required for the induction of the alkB gene product alkane hydroxylase. The second cistron (alkT), which encodes the 48-kDa protein, is required for reconstitution of an Alk phenotype but has no function in regulation of alkBAC expression. Thus, the expression of the alkBAC operon is regulated by a 99-kDa protein, whereas the 48-kDa protein is probably a component of the alkane hydroxylase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1969399888,"Mapping and manipulation of very large genomes, including the human genome, would be facilitated by the availability of a DNA cleavage method with very high site specificity. Therefore, a general method was devised that extends the effective recognition sequences well beyond the present 8-base pair limit by combining the specificity of the restriction endonuclease with that of another sequence-specific protein that binds tightly to DNA. It was shown that the tightly binding lac or lambda repressor protects a restriction site within the operator from specific modification methylases, M.Hha I or M.Hph I, while all other similar sites are methylated and thus rendered uncleavable. A plasmid containing a symmetric lac operator was specifically cleaved by Hha I, only at the site within the operator, after M.Hha I methylation in the presence of the lac repressor, whereas the remaining 31 Hha I sites on this plasmid were methylated and thus not cleaved. Analogous results were obtained with the Hae II site within the lac operator, which was similarly protected by the lac repressor, and with the Hph I site within the phage lambda oL operator, which was protected by lambda repressor from M.Hph I methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1568734886,"Abstract The steroid 21-hydroxylase (21-OHase) gene is selectively expressed at high levels in cells of the adrenal cortex and is transcriptionally regulated by corticotropin (ACTH). In this study, we examined the contribution of cis-acting nucleotide sequences to the regulated expression of the mouse 21-OHase gene. The 5'-flanking sequences of the mouse 21-OHase gene, extending 330 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site, were placed in front of the human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene, and expression of the fusion gene was measured following transient transfection in Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells. The 330 bp of 21-OHase flanking sequence directed both basal and ACTH-stimulated expression of hGH in Y1 adrenocortical cells but did not direct hGH expression in I-10 mouse testicular Leydig cells or in mouse fibroblast L cells. The 21-OHase/hGH fusion gene was poorly expressed in Y1 mutants defective in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These results indicate that sequences necessary for adrenal cell-selective and ACTH-regulated expression of the 21-OHase gene reside within the first 330 bp of 5'-flanking DNA and that constitutive expression of the gene requires the integrity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The constitutive expression of hGH in Y1 cells was decreased dramatically (40-fold) when the 21-OHase flanking sequences in front of hGH were shortened to 156 bp from the transcription initiation site and was restored when the upstream sequences of the 21-OHase gene, from -330 to -150, were added back; the sequences from -330 to -150 were equally effective in either the correct or reverse orientation. From these observations, we conclude that an enhancer element is contained within the sequences from -330 to -150 bp upstream of the 21-OHase transcription initiation site."

Renal and hepatic microsomes also have detectable levels of these enzymes except ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. Their location in the cisternae is indicated by their latencies, i.e. requirement for disruption of the membrane for activity. In addition, transketolase, transaldolase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, a known cisternal enzyme, are inactivated by chymotrypsin and subtilisin only in disrupted hepatic microsomes under conditions in which NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, an enzyme on the external surface, is inactivated equally in intact and disrupted microsomes. The failure to detect the epimerase and isomerase in hepatic microsomes is due to inhibition of their assays by ketopentose-5-phosphatase. Xylulose 5-phosphate is hydrolyzed faster than ribulose 5-phosphate. A mild heat treatment destroys hepatic xylulose-5-phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase without affecting acid phosphatase. These results plus the established wide distribution of glucose dehydrogenase, the microsomal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and its localization to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum suggest that most mammalian cells have two sets of enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway: one is cytoplasmic and the other is in the endoplasmic reticulum. The activity of the microsomal pentose phosphate pathway is estimated to be about 1.5% that of the cytoplasmic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1494211618,"Two H4IIE hepatoma cell genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and gene 33 (g33), are reciprocally regulated by insulin. Quantitation of mRNAPEPCK and mRNAg33 in total RNA isolated from cells treated with insulin showed a 7-fold increase in mRNAg33 amount and a 3-fold decrease of mRNAPEPCK. The cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP induced mRNAPEPCK but had no effect on mRNAg33. The responses to various insulins and related molecules showed that the insulin receptor mediates the effects of physiologic concentrations of insulin on each of these genes. This inverse pattern of regulation by insulin was further characterized by determining the transcription rates of both genes in nuclei isolated at various times after the addition of insulin and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP to H4IIE cells. Insulin increased the rate of synthesis of mRNAg33 from 35 to 354 ppm and decreased the synthesis of mRNAPEPCK from 1175 to 109 ppm. These effects of insulin occurred rapidly and reached their maxima by 60 min. In both cases, greater effects were observed as insulin concentrations were increased from 10(-12) to 10(-8) M. Although the effects of insulin were concentration-dependent for both genes, the PEPCK gene was significantly more sensitive to low concentrations of insulin than was gene 33. The reciprocal effects of insulin on the synthesis of mRNAPEPCK and mRNAg33 in H4IIE cells provide a means of investigating how a hormone can exert opposing effects on two genes in the same cell."
https://openalex.org/W175904678,"Escherichia coli has a unique enzyme, deoxyguanosine triphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dGTPase) that cleaves dGTP into deoxyguanosine and tripolyphosphate. An E. coli mutant, optA1, has a 50-fold increased level of the dGTPase (Beauchamp, B.B., and Richardson, C.C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 2563-2567). Successful infection of E. coli optA1 by bacteriophage T7 is dependent on a 10-kDa protein encoded by gene 1.2 of the phage. In this report we show that the gene 1.2 protein is a specific inhibitor of the E. coli dGTPase. Gene 1.2 protein inhibits dGTPase activity by forming a complex with the dGTPase with an apparent stoichiometry of two monomers of gene 1.2 protein/tetramer of dGTPase. The interaction is reversible with a half-life of the complex of 30 min and an apparent binding constant Ki of 35 nM. The binding of inhibitor of dGTPase is cooperative, indicating allosteric interactions between dGTPase subunits with a Hill coefficient of 1.7. The interaction is modulated differentially by DNA, RNA, and deoxyguanosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate. Both the binding of the substrate dGTP and of the inhibitor gene 1.2 protein induce conformational changes in dGTPase. The conformation of the enzyme in the presence of saturating concentrations of dGTP virtually prevents the association with, and the dissociation from, gene 1.2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W128534927,"The site and mechanism of dioxygen reduction in cytochrome c oxidase from bovine heart muscle have been investigated. The rate of cytochrome c2+ oxidation by O2 is shown to be affected by several factors: 1) pH, with optima at 5.65 and 6.0, 2) temperature between 0 and 29 degrees C, with E alpha = 13 kcal mol-1, 3) D2O exchange, with a reduction in rate of 50% or more at the pH optima, and 4) the addition of ethylene glycol or glycerol, which significantly lowers the rate. The extremely narrow (delta vCO approximately 4 cm-1) infrared stretch bands at approximately 1964 and approximately 1959 cm-1 for liganded CO are only slightly affected by factors 1-4 or by changes in the oxidation state of metals other than the heme alpha 3 iron. These results indicate a stable, unusually immobile O2 reduction site well-isolated from the external medium, a characteristic expected to be important for oxidase function. Precise stereochemical positioning of hydrogen donors adjacent to O2 liganded to heme alpha 3 iron can be expected in order to achieve the optimization of the time/distance relationships required for enzyme catalysis. These findings support a novel mechanism of O2 reduction via a hydroperoxide intermediate within a reaction pocket that experiences little change in conformation during the hydrogen and electron transfer steps."

https://openalex.org/W1665614560,"The GntR protein is a negative regulator involved in gluconate-inducible expression of the Bacillus subtilis gnt operon which is responsible for gluconate metabolism. The GntR protein has been purified to homogeneity from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain harboring a gntR gene-carrying plasmid. The total amino acid composition and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein were essentially the same as those deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gntR gene. Molecular weight determination by gel filtration revealed that the purified protein is in a highly polymerized form, but it likely exists as a dimer when highly diluted. The purified GntR protein was found to be specifically bound to DNA fragments carrying the promoter of the gnt operon in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This binding was specifically inhibited by the addition of gluconate or glucono-delta-lactone. The purified protein repressed in vitro transcription from the promoter of the gnt operon. This repression was suppressed by gluconate or glucono-delta-lactone. These results indicate that the GntR protein is a repressor for the gnt operon and that gluconate and glucono-delta-lactone are inducers for this operon."
https://openalex.org/W1518908263,"The cDNA for porcine preprocholecystokinin (pre-pro-CCK) was engineered for expression in mammalian cells under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter. This expression construct was transfected into the murine anterior pituitary cell line, AtT-20. A stable cell line (AtT-20/CCK) was derived that expresses CCK mRNA indistinguishable from the CCK mRNA found in pig brain or gut. The AtT-20/CCK cells carry out proteolytic processing and sulfation reactions to generate authentic sulfated CCK8 from pro-CCK. The cells also store and secrete CCK-immunoreactive peptides. This secretion can be stimulated with corticotropin releasing factor, the natural secretagogue for anterior pituitary cells. In contrast, monkey kidney epithelial cells (COS cells), which are transiently transfected to express CCK, predominantly secrete nonsulfated pro-CCK into the medium. These studies show that a murine neuroendocrine cell line contains the complete processing machinery required to generate authentic porcine CCK8. The processing events include simultaneous proteolytic processing at one and two basic amino acid sites and sulfation of tyrosine residues. The cell line thus duplicates exactly the processing patterns found to occur in pig brain cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1568754814,"Abstract We have constructed a cDNA encoding the entire human pro-alpha 2(I) collagen molecule. Sequence determination for 2196 base pairs at the 5' end of the cDNA clone, and comparison with previously characterized human alpha 2(I) sequences, identified a number of nucleotide and amino acid polymorphisms. Functionality of the cDNA clone, under control of the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus, was demonstrated by its introduction into the W8 cell line. The W8 line, a chemically transformed variant of K16 rat liver epithelial cells, has been previously shown to lack detectable levels of alpha 2(I) RNA, but to secrete alpha 1(I) homotrimers. Introduction of the human cDNA into W8 cells, resulted in secretion of chimeric type I collagen comprised of rat alpha 1(I) and human alpha 2(I) chains. Availability of a functional full-length clone of human alpha 2(I) cDNA, combined with the W8 cell line as expression system, will allow detailed analysis, through site-directed mutagenesis, of domains on the pro-alpha 2(I) molecule involved in assembly, transport, secretion, and fibrillogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515954394,"Sequence context may profoundly alter the character of structural transitions in supercoiled DNA (Sullivan, K. M., and Lilley, D. M. J. (1986) Cell 47, 817-827). The A + T-rich sequences of ColE1, which flank the inverted repeat, are responsible for cruciform extrusion following a mechanistic pathway which proceeds via a relatively large denatured region. This C-type mechanism results in kinetic properties which are very different from those of the S-type pathway, the normal mechanism of cruciform extrusion in the absence of the ColE1 flanking sequences. We have analyzed the sequence requirements for the induction of the C-type pathway. The 100-base pair left side sequence of ColE1 (colL) was subjected to systematic deletion using Bal31 exonucleolysis, showing that removal of 30 base pairs from its right end abolished extrusion by the C-type process. A cloned oligonucleotide of the same 30-base pair sequence was sufficient to confer C-type cruciform extrusion on an adjacent inverted repeat. An A + T-rich sequence from Drosophila was found to act like the ColE1 sequences. We have studied the effects of introducing sequences between the A + T-rich colL, and the inverted repeat on which it acts. A range of such fragments was found, from those which augment the effect of colL to those which block it completely. In general, it appears that the ability of a sequence to block the effect of colL depends on both the length and G + C content of the fragment. The sequences which are responsible for the extrusion by the C-type pathway are termed C-type inducing sequences, while sequences which are interposed between the inducing sequence and the inverted repeat, and which may either augment or attenuate the effect, but which cannot function as inducing sequences in isolation, are termed transmitting sequences. The results of these studies are most readily consistent with long range destabilization of DNA structure via telestability effects."
https://openalex.org/W1579792399,"Na+,K+-ATPase from pig kidney was sequentially modified with N-[p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl]maleimide (BIPM) at Cys-964 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at Lys-501. The resulting preparation showed little Na+,K+-ATPase activity with retention of nearly 90% of phosphorylation capacity from acetyl phosphate. The addition of acetyl phosphate to the preparation induced phosphoenzyme formation with a sequential decrease in the fluorescence intensities in the presence of 2 M NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2; the BIPM fluorescence decreased with a simultaneous increase in the amount of phosphoenzyme; there was a significant delay in a decrease in the FITC fluorescence. The extent of the decrease in the BIPM fluorescence and the increase in the amount of phosphoenzyme both showed monophasic kinetics with a similar dependence on the concentration of acetyl phosphate (K0.5 = 4 mM), while that of FITC fluorescence showed a biphasic decrease (K 0.5 greater than 10 mM). The phosphoenzyme formed was insensitive to ADP but sensitive to acetate (K0.5 = 2 M). These data and those of others (Taniguchi, K., Suzuki, K., Kai, D., Matsuoka, I., Tomita, K., and Iida, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15228-15233) showed that the extent of the decrease in the BIPM fluorescence reflects an increase in the amount of a precursor of E1P and E1P, irrespective of the FITC treatment. They also suggest the presence of at least two conformationally different E1Ps; one gave little and the other gave a large FITC fluorescence decrease."
https://openalex.org/W1480044079,"Ternary complexes of RNA-DNA-RNA polymerase II, originating from the in vivo transcriptionally active SV40 minichromosomes, can be detected and analyzed by a method previously developed (Choder, M., Bratosin, S., and Aloni, Y. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 2929-2936). Using this method, we compared the electrophoretic mobilities of SV40 ternary complexes with those of SV40 RNA-DNA complexes obtained after the removal of the polymerases. Independent of the in vitro elongation of the nascent RNA, topoisomers of ternary complexes including supercoiled DNA (DNA I) and relaxed DNA (DNA II) electrophoresed on agarose gels as sharp bands. In addition, the polymerase protected 18-22 nucleotides of the nascent RNA from RNase A and T1 digestion. These results demonstrate the constancy of the length of the unwound region in the transcription bubble. In contrast, following the removal of the polymerases topoisomers of RNA-DNA I complexes migrated on agarose gels as a smear between the sites of DNA I and DNA II. RNA with an average length of 120 nucleotides formed hybrid with the DNA and was RNase A- and T1-resistant. The observations that long hybrid formation is prevented as long as the polymerases are present, and the maintenance of the constant length of the transcription bubble during transcription elongation, suggest that during elongation the enzyme that actively unwinds the template allows the synchronous displacement of the nascent transcript and rewinding of the template."

https://openalex.org/W1608163062,"An internal deletion in the presequence of the precursor to yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV blocks import of the protein into mitochondria. We have identified two mechanisms by which yeast cells can suppress the defect of the plasmid-borne defective gene. One mechanism creates a new functional presequence by point mutations, or local DNA rearrangements, within the open reading frame or its 5'-untranslated region. The second mechanism compensates for the defective presequence by recessive mutations in single nuclear genes. The plasmid-linked mutations may mimic the mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial presequences arose during evolution whereas the chromosomal mutations may help to identify components of the mitochondrial import machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1546134266,"Rabbit peritoneal neutrophils were stimulated with either the chemotactic factor, fMet-Leu-Phe (10(-8) M, 10 s) or the protein kinase C activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), (0.1 microgram/ml, 3 min) at 37 degrees C, lysed with Triton X-100 at the indicated times and the histone H4 kinase activity of the lysate measured. The histone H4 protein kinase activity was increased severalfold by fMet-Leu-Phe but not PMA. The inclusion of the potent protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (50 microM) inhibited little if any of the histone H4 protein kinase activity. The effect of fMet-Leu-Phe was transient, maximum stimulation occurring within 10 s and decaying thereafter. The soluble fraction (extract) of the Triton X-100 lysates from control and fMet-Leu-Phe-treated cells was found to contain both histone H4 protein kinase and calcium-phospholipid-activated protein kinase (protein kinase C) activities. The histone H4 protein kinase activity obtained after fMet-Leu-Phe treatment was very little affected by calcium, phospholipid, and PMA and preferred histone H4 but not H1 or H2A as its substrate. In contrast, the calcium-phospholipid-activated protein kinase activity of the extract preferred histones H1 or H2A as substrates and was strongly inhibited by 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine. The histone H4 protein kinase was partially separated from kinase C by DEAE-cellulose and phenyl-Sepharose 4B chromatography. It phosphorylated mostly serine in histone H4. The results indicate that the chemotactic factor, fMet-Leu-Phe, stimulates a protein kinase with substrate specificity and biochemical properties distinct from calcium-phospholipid-activated protein kinase C."
