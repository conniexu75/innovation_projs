https://openalex.org/W4200351462,"Identifying which children and young people (CYP) are most vulnerable to serious infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is important to guide protective interventions. To address this question, we used data for all hospitalizations in England among 0-17 year olds from 1 February 2019 to 31 January 2021. We examined how sociodemographic factors and comorbidities might be risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission among hospitalizations due to the following causes: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pediatric inflammatory multi-system syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in the first pandemic year (2020-2021); hospitalizations due to all other non-traumatic causes in 2020-2021; hospitalizations due to all non-traumatic causes in 2019-2020; and hospitalizations due to influenza in 2019-2020. Risk of PICU admission and death from COVID-19 or PIMS-TS in CYP was very low. We identified 6,338 hospitalizations with COVID-19, of which 259 were admitted to a PICU and eight CYP died. We identified 712 hospitalizations with PIMS-TS, of which 312 were admitted to a PICU and fewer than five CYP died. Hospitalizations with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS were more common among males, older CYP, those from socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods and those who were of non-White ethnicity (Black, Asian, Mixed or Other). The odds of PICU admission were increased in CYP younger than 1 month old and decreased among 15-17 year olds compared to 1-4 year olds with COVID-19; increased in older CYP and females with PIMS-TS; and increased for Black compared to White ethnicity in patients with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS. Odds of PICU admission in COVID-19 were increased for CYP with comorbidities and highest for CYP with multiple medical problems. Increases in odds of PICU admission associated with different comorbidities in COVID-19 showed a similar pattern to other causes of hospitalization examined and, thus, likely reflect background vulnerabilities. These findings identify distinct risk factors associated with PICU admission among CYP with COVID-19 or PIMS-TS that might aid treatment and prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4200559672,"Although the cohort-level accuracy of polygenic risk scores (PRSs)-estimates of genetic value at the individual level-has been widely assessed, uncertainty in PRSs remains underexplored. In the present study, we show that Bayesian PRS methods can estimate the variance of an individual's PRS and can yield well-calibrated credible intervals via posterior sampling. For 13 real traits in the UK Biobank (n = 291,273 unrelated 'white British'), we observe large variances in individual PRS estimates which impact interpretation of PRS-based stratification; averaging across traits, only 0.8% (s.d. = 1.6%) of individuals with PRS point estimates in the top decile have corresponding 95% credible intervals fully contained in the top decile. We provide an analytical estimator for the expectation of individual PRS variance as a function of SNP heritability, number of causal SNPs and sample size. Our results showcase the importance of incorporating uncertainty in individual PRS estimates into subsequent analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4200433224,"Heparin, a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan, has been found to have antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for the antiviral activity of heparin, we investigated the binding of heparin to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by means of sliding window docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays. Our simulations show that heparin binds at long, positively charged patches on the spike glycoprotein, thereby masking basic residues of both the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the multifunctional S1/S2 site. Biochemical experiments corroborated the simulation results, showing that heparin inhibits the furin-mediated cleavage of spike by binding to the S1/S2 site. Our simulations showed that heparin can act on the hinge region responsible for motion of the RBD between the inactive closed and active open conformations of the spike glycoprotein. In simulations of the closed spike homotrimer, heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders opening. In simulations of open spike conformations, heparin induces stabilization of the hinge region and a change in RBD motion. Our results indicate that heparin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by three mechanisms: by allosterically hindering binding to the host cell receptor, by directly competing with binding to host heparan sulfate proteoglycan coreceptors, and by preventing spike cleavage by furin. Furthermore, these simulations provide insights into how host heparan sulfate proteoglycans can facilitate viral infection. Our results will aid the rational optimization of heparin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4200171146,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), as the only enzyme in mammals capable of reducing esterified phospholipid hydroperoxides within a cellular context, protects cells from ferroptosis. We identified a homozygous point mutation in the GPX4 gene, resulting in an R152H coding mutation, in three patients with Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Using structure-based analyses and cell models, including patient fibroblasts, of this variant, we found that the missense variant destabilized a critical loop, which disrupted the active site and caused a substantial loss of enzymatic function. We also found that the R152H variant of GPX4 is less susceptible to degradation, revealing the degradation mechanism of the GPX4 protein. Proof-of-concept therapeutic treatments, which overcome the impaired R152H GPX4 activity, including selenium supplementation, selective antioxidants and a deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acid were identified. In addition to revealing a general approach to investigating rare genetic diseases, we demonstrate the biochemical foundations of therapeutic strategies targeting GPX4."
https://openalex.org/W4200364487,"Alphaviruses, like many other arthropod-borne viruses, infect vertebrate species and insect vectors separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history. Entry into evolutionarily divergent host cells can be accomplished by recognition of different cellular receptors in different species, or by binding to receptors that are highly conserved across species. Although multiple alphavirus receptors have been described1–3, most are not shared among vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Here we identify the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) as a receptor for the prototypic alphavirus Semliki forest virus. We show that the E2 and E1 glycoproteins (E2–E1) of Semliki forest virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus interact with the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of VLDLR and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), two closely related receptors. Ectopic expression of either protein facilitates cellular attachment, and internalization of virus-like particles, a VLDLR LBD–Fc fusion protein or a ligand-binding antagonist block Semliki forest virus E2–E1-mediated infection of human and mouse neurons in culture. The administration of a VLDLR LBD–Fc fusion protein has protective activity against rapidly fatal Semliki forest virus infection in mouse neonates. We further show that invertebrate receptor orthologues from mosquitoes and worms can serve as functional alphavirus receptors. We propose that the ability of some alphaviruses to infect a wide range of hosts is a result of their engagement of evolutionarily conserved lipoprotein receptors and contributes to their pathogenesis. Studies using viral coat glycoproteins show that alphaviruses can enter cells via the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), members of an evolutionarily conserved family of lipoprotein receptors."
https://openalex.org/W4200465604,"Complement activation contributes to lung dysfunction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We assessed whether C5 blockade with eculizumab could improve disease outcome.In this single-centre, academic, unblinded study two 900 mg eculizumab doses were added-on standard therapy in ten COVID-19 patients admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 and receiving Continuous-Positive-Airway-Pressure (CPAP) ventilator support from ≤24 hours. We compared their outcomes with those of 65 contemporary similar controls. Primary outcome was respiratory rate at one week of ventilator support. Secondary outcomes included the combined endpoint of mortality and discharge with chronic complications.Baseline characteristics of eculizumab-treated patients and controls were similar. At baseline, sC5b-9 levels, ex vivo C5b-9 and thrombi deposition were increased. Ex vivo tests normalised in eculizumab-treated patients, but not in controls. In eculizumab-treated patients respiratory rate decreased from 26.8±7.3 breaths/min at baseline to 20.3±3.8 and 18.0±4.8 breaths/min at one and two weeks, respectively (p<0.05 for both), but did not change in controls. Between-group changes differed significantly at both time-points (p<0.01). Changes in respiratory rate correlated with concomitant changes in ex vivo C5b-9 deposits at one (rs = 0.706, p = 0.010) and two (rs = 0.751, p = 0.032) weeks. Over a median (IQR) period of 47.0 (14.0-121.0) days, four eculizumab-treated patients died or had chronic complications versus 52 controls [HRCrude (95% CI): 0.26 (0.09-0.72), p = 0.010]. Between-group difference was significant even after adjustment for age, sex and baseline serum creatinine [HRAdjusted (95% CI): 0.30 (0.10-0.84), p = 0.023]. Six patients and 13 controls were discharged without complications [HRCrude (95% CI): 2.88 (1.08-7.70), p = 0.035]. Eculizumab was tolerated well. The main study limitations were the relatively small sample size and the non-randomised design.In patients with severe COVID-19, eculizumab safely improved respiratory dysfunction and decreased the combined endpoint of mortality and discharge with chronic complications. Findings need confirmation in randomised controlled trials."
https://openalex.org/W4200582884,"Bacterial products can act on neurons to alter signaling and function. In the present study, we found that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons are enriched for ANTXR2, the high-affinity receptor for anthrax toxins. Anthrax toxins are composed of protective antigen (PA), which binds to ANTXR2, and the protein cargoes edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). Intrathecal administration of edema toxin (ET (PA + EF)) targeted DRG neurons and induced analgesia in mice. ET inhibited mechanical and thermal sensation, and pain caused by formalin, carrageenan or nerve injury. Analgesia depended on ANTXR2 expressed by Nav1.8+ or Advillin+ neurons. ET modulated protein kinase A signaling in mouse sensory and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons, and attenuated spinal cord neurotransmission. We further engineered anthrax toxins to introduce exogenous protein cargoes, including botulinum toxin, into DRG neurons to silence pain. Our study highlights interactions between a bacterial toxin and nociceptors, which may lead to the development of new pain therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4200138324,"Arts and cultural engagement are associated with a range of mental and physical health benefits, including promoting heathy aging and lower incidence of age-related disabilities such as slower cognitive decline and slower progression of frailty. This suggests arts engagement constitutes health-promoting behaviour in older age. However, there are no large-scale studies examining how the predictors of arts engagement vary with age.Data from the Health and Retirement Study (2014) were used to identify sociodemographic, life satisfaction, social, and arts appreciation predictors of (1) frequency of arts engagement, (2) cultural attendance, (3) difficulty participating in the arts, and (4) being an interested non-attendee of cultural events. Logistic regression models were stratified by age groups [50-59, 60-69, ≥70] for the frequency of arts participation outcome and [50-69 vs ≥70] all other outcomes.Findings indicated a number of age-related predictors of frequent arts engagement, including gender, educational attainment, wealth, dissatisfaction with aging, and instrumental activities of daily living (iADL). For cultural event attendance, lower interest in the arts predicted lack of engagement across age groups, whereas higher educational attainment and more frequent religious service attendance became predictors in older age groups (≥ 70). Adults in both age groups were less likely to report difficulties engaging in the arts if they had lower neighbourhood safety, whilst poor self-rated health and low arts appreciation also predicted reduced likelihood of this outcome, but only in the younger (50-69) age group. Adults in the older (≥ 70) age group were more likely to be interested non-attendees of cultural events if they had higher educational attainment and less likely if they lived in neighbourhoods with low levels of safety.Our results suggest that certain factors become stronger predictors of arts and cultural engagement and barriers to engagement as people age. Further, there appear to be socioeconomic inequalities in engagement that may increase in older ages, with arts activities overall more accessible as individuals age compared to cultural engagement due to additional financial barriers and transportation barriers. Ensuring that these activities are accessible to people of all ages will allow older adults to benefit from the range of health outcomes gained from arts and cultural engagement."
https://openalex.org/W4200570372,"Activated macrophages undergo metabolic reprogramming, which not only supports their energetic demands but also allows for the production of specific metabolites that function as signaling molecules. Several Krebs cycles, or Krebs-cycle-derived metabolites, including succinate, α-ketoglutarate, and itaconate, have recently been shown to modulate macrophage function. The accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) has also been well documented in transformed cells and more recently shown to play a role in T cell and dendritic cell function. Here we have found that the abundance of both enantiomers of 2HG is increased in LPS-activated macrophages. We show that L-2HG, but not D-2HG, can promote the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and the adoption of an inflammatory, highly glycolytic metabolic state. These changes are likely mediated through activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) by L-2HG, a known inhibitor of the HIF prolyl hydroxylases. Expression of the enzyme responsible for L-2HG degradation, L-2HG dehydrogenase (L-2HGDH), was also found to be decreased in LPS-stimulated macrophages and may therefore also contribute to L-2HG accumulation. Finally, overexpression of L-2HGDH in HEK293 TLR4/MD2/CD14 cells inhibited HIF-1α activation by LPS, while knockdown of L-2HGDH in macrophages boosted the induction of HIF-1α-dependent genes, as well as increasing LPS-induced HIF-1α activity. Taken together, this study therefore identifies L-2HG as a metabolite that can regulate HIF-1α in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W4225669878,"As base excess had shown superiority over lactate as a prognostic parameter in intensive care unit (ICU) surgical patients we aimed to evaluate course of lactate, base excess and pH for prediction of mortality of medical ICU patients.For lactate, pH and base excess, values at the admission to ICU, at 24 ± 4 hours, maximum or minimum in the first 24 hours and in 24-48 hours after admission were collected from all patients admitted to the Medical ICU of the University Hospital Tübingen between January 2016 until December 2018 (N = 4067 at admission, N = 1715 with ICU treatment > 48 h) and investigated for prediction of in-hospital-mortality.Mortality was 22% and significantly correlated with all evaluated parameters. Strongest predictors of mortality determined by ROC were maximum lactate in 24 h (AUROC 0.74, cut off 2.7 mmol/L, hazard ratio of risk group with value > cut off 3.20) and minimum pH in 24 h (AUROC 0.71, cut off 7.31, hazard ratio for risk group 2.94). Kaplan Meier Curves stratified across these cut offs showed early and clear separation. Hazard ratios per standard deviation increase were highest for maximum lactate in 24 h (HR 1.65), minimum base excess in 24 h (HR 1.56) and minimum pH in 24 h (HR 0.75).Lactate, pH and base excess were all suitable predictors of mortality in internal ICU patients, with maximum / minimum values in 24 and 24-48 h after admission altogether stronger predictors than values at admission. Base excess and pH were not superior to lactate for prediction of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4200548340,"Although the individual structures and respiratory functions of cytochromes are well studied, the structural basis for their assembly, including transport of heme for attachment, are unknown. We describe cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of CcsBA, a bifunctional heme transporter and cytochrome c (cyt c) synthase. Models built from the cryo-EM densities show that CcsBA is trapped with heme in two conformations, herein termed the closed and open states. The closed state has heme located solely at a transmembrane (TM) site, with a large periplasmic domain oriented such that access of heme to the cytochrome acceptor is denied. The open conformation contains two heme moieties, one in the TM-heme site and another in an external site (P-heme site). The presence of heme in the periplasmic site at the base of a chamber induces a large conformational shift that exposes the heme for reaction with apocytochrome c (apocyt c). Consistent with these structures, in vivo and in vitro cyt c synthase studies suggest a mechanism for transfer of the periplasmic heme to cytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W4200551850,"Substrate efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which play a major role in multidrug resistance, entails the ATP-powered interconversion between transporter intermediates. Despite recent progress in structure elucidation, a number of intermediates have yet to be visualized and mechanistically interpreted. Here, we combine cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to profile a previously unobserved intermediate of BmrCD, a heterodimeric multidrug ABC exporter from Bacillus subtilis. In our cryo-EM structure, ATP-bound BmrCD adopts an inward-facing architecture featuring two molecules of the substrate Hoechst-33342 in a striking asymmetric head-to-tail arrangement. Deletion of the extracellular domain capping the substrate-binding chamber or mutation of Hoechst-coordinating residues abrogates cooperative stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. Together, our findings support a mechanistic role for symmetry mismatch between the nucleotide binding and the transmembrane domains in the conformational cycle of ABC transporters and is of notable importance for rational design of molecules for targeted ABC transporter inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W4225650071,"Multi-enzyme assemblies composed of metabolic enzymes catalyzing sequential reactions are being increasingly studied. Here, we report the discovery of a 1.6 megadalton multi-enzyme complex from Bacillus subtilis composed of two enzymes catalyzing opposite ('counter-enzymes') rather than sequential reactions: glutamate synthase (GltAB) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GudB), which make and break glutamate, respectively. In vivo and in vitro studies show that the primary role of complex formation is to inhibit the activity of GudB. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we elucidated the structure of the complex and the molecular basis of inhibition of GudB by GltAB. The complex exhibits unusual oscillatory progress curves and is necessary for both planktonic growth, in glutamate-limiting conditions, and for biofilm growth, in glutamate-rich media. The regulation of a key metabolic enzyme by complexing with its counter enzyme may thus enable cell growth under fluctuating glutamate concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W4200382916,"The study aimed at exploring the adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and their incidences among health workers in three different districts of central and western Nepal following the first dose of Covishield vaccine,. It also aimed at studying the association of AEFI with demographic and clinical characteristics of vaccinees, pre-vaccination anxiety level and prior history of COVID-19 infection (RT- PCR confirmed) status.This was a cross-sectional study carried out via face-to-face or telephonic interview among 1006 health workers one week after receiving their first dose of the Covishield vaccine. Incidence of adverse events was calculated in percentage while Chi-square Test was used to check the association of AEFI with independent variables. Logistic regression was used to find out the adjusted odd's ratio at 95% CI.Incidence of AEFI was 79.8% with local and systemic AEFI being 68.0% and 59.7% respectively. Injection site tenderness was the commonest manifestation. Local and systemic symptoms resolved in less than one week among 96.8% and 98.7% vaccinees respectively. Females were more likely to develop AEFI than males (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Vaccinees aged 45-59 years were 50% less likely to develop AEFI as compared to those aged less than 30 years (AOR 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.8). Most of the vaccinees had not undergone RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 (59.8%). Those who were not tested for COVID-19 prior were 1.5 odds more likely to develop AEFI compared to those who were negative (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1).More than two-third of the vaccinees developed one or more forms of adverse events, but most events were self-limiting. Females and young adults were more prone to develop AEFI."
https://openalex.org/W4200509062,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) not only is an oxidant but also is an important signaling molecule in vascular biology, mediating several physiological functions. Red blood cells (RBCs) have been proposed to be the primary sink of H2O2 in the vasculature because they are the main cellular component of blood with a robust antioxidant defense and a high membrane permeability. However, the exact permeability of human RBC to H2O2 is neither known nor is it known if the mechanism of permeation involves the lipid fraction or protein channels. To gain insight into the permeability process, we measured the partition constant of H2O2 between water and octanol or hexadecane using a novel double-partition method. Our results indicated that there is a large thermodynamic barrier to H2O2 permeation. The permeability coefficient of H2O2 through phospholipid membranes containing cholesterol with saturated or unsaturated acyl chains was determined to be 4 × 10-4 and 5 × 10-3 cm s-1, respectively, at 37 °C. The permeability coefficient of human RBC membranes to H2O2 at 37 °C, on the other hand, was 1.6 × 10-3 cm s-1. Different aquaporin-1 and aquaporin-3 inhibitors proved to have no effect on the permeation of H2O2. Moreover, human RBCs devoid of either aquaporin-1 or aquaporin-3 were equally permeable to H2O2 as normal human RBCs. Therefore, these results indicate that H2O2 does not diffuse into RBCs through aquaporins but rather through the lipid fraction or a still unidentified membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W4200096228,"Genome-wide association studies have shown an increased risk of type-2-diabetes (T2DM) in patients who carry single nucleotide polymorphisms in several genes. We investigated whether the same gene loci confer a risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women from Hawaii, and in particular, Pacific Islander and Filipino populations.Blood was collected from 291 women with GDM and 734 matched non-diabetic controls (Pacific Islanders: 71 GDM, 197 non-diabetic controls; Filipinos: 162 GDM, 395 controls; Japanese: 58 GDM, 142 controls). Maternal DNA was used to genotype and show allele frequencies of 25 different SNPs mapped to 18 different loci.After adjusting for age, BMI, parity and gravidity by multivariable logistic regression, several SNPs showed significant associations with GDM and were ethnicity specific. In particular, SNPs rs1113132 (EXT2), rs1111875 (HHEX), rs2237892 (KCNQ1), rs2237895 (KCNQ1), rs10830963 (MTNR1B) and rs13266634 (SLC30A8) showed significant associations with GDM in Filipinos. For Japanese, SNPs rs4402960 (IGFBP2) and rs2237892 (KCNQ1) were significantly associated with GDM. For Pacific Islanders, SNPs rs10830963 (MTNR1B) and rs13266634 (SLC30A8) showed significant associations with GDM. Individually, none of the SNPs showed a consistent association with GDM across all three investigated ethnicities.Several SNPs associated with T2DM are found to confer increased risk for GDM in a multiethnic cohort in Hawaii."
https://openalex.org/W4200277415,"The aberrant self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) into soluble oligomers and their interactions with biological membranes underlie the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Catechins have emerged as useful tools to reduce the toxicity of IDP oligomers by modulating their interactions with membranes. However, the structural determinants of catechin binding to IDP oligomers and membranes remain largely elusive. Here, we assemble a catechin library by combining several naturally occurring chemical modifications and, using a coupled NMR-statistical approach, we map at atomic resolution the interactions of such library with the Alzheimer's-associated amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers and model membranes. Our results reveal multiple catechin affinity drivers and show that the combination of affinity-reducing covalent changes may lead to unexpected net gains in affinity. Interestingly, we find that the positive cooperativity is more prevalent for Aβ oligomers than membrane binding, and that the determinants underlying catechin recognition by membranes are markedly different from those dissected for Aβ oligomers. Notably, we find that the unanticipated positive cooperativity arises from the critical regulatory role of the gallate catechin moiety, which recruits previously disengaged substituents into the binding interface and leads to an overall greater compaction of the receptor-bound conformation. Overall, the previously elusive structural attributes mapped here provide an unprecedented foundation to establish structure-activity relationships of catechins."
https://openalex.org/W4200292493,"Assessment of repetitive movements (e.g., finger tapping) is a hallmark of motor examinations in several neurologic populations. These assessments are traditionally performed by a human rater via visual inspection; however, advances in computer vision offer potential for remote, quantitative assessment using simple video recordings. Here, we evaluated a pose estimation approach for measurement of human movement frequency from smartphone videos. Ten healthy young participants provided videos of themselves performing five repetitive movement tasks (finger tapping, hand open/close, hand pronation/supination, toe tapping, leg agility) at four target frequencies (1–4 Hz). We assessed the ability of a workflow that incorporated OpenPose (a freely available whole-body pose estimation algorithm) to estimate movement frequencies by comparing against manual frame-by-frame (i.e., ground-truth) measurements for all tasks and target frequencies using repeated measures ANOVA, Pearson’s correlations, and intraclass correlations. Our workflow produced largely accurate estimates of movement frequencies; only the hand open/close task showed a significant difference in the frequencies estimated by pose estimation and manual measurement (while statistically significant, these differences were small in magnitude). All other tasks and frequencies showed no significant differences between pose estimation and manual measurement. Pose estimation-based detections of individual events (e.g., finger taps, hand closures) showed strong correlations (all r &gt;0.99) with manual detections for all tasks and frequencies. In summary, our pose estimation-based workflow accurately tracked repetitive movements in healthy adults across a range of tasks and movement frequencies. Future work will test this approach as a fast, quantitative, video-based approach to assessment of repetitive movements in clinical populations."
https://openalex.org/W4200337630,"There is widespread recognition that stressors related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) jeopardize the development of emerging adults, more particularly those living in disadvantaged communities. What is less well understood is what might support emerging adult resilience to COVID-19-related stressors. In response, this article reports a 5-week qualitative study with 24 emerging adults (average age: 20) living in a South African township. Using digital diaries and repeated individual interviews, young people shared their lived experiences of later (i.e., month 4 and 7) lockdown-related challenges (i.e., contagion fears; livelihood threats; lives-on-hold) and how they managed these challenges. An inductive thematic analysis showed that personal and collective compliance, generous ways-of-being, and tolerance-facilitators enabled emerging adult resilience to said challenges. Importantly, these resilience-enablers drew on resources associated with multiple systems and reflected the situational and cultural context of the township in question. In short, supporting emerging adult resilience to COVID-19-related stressors will require contextually aligned, multisystemic responses."
https://openalex.org/W4200010586,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize society by automating tasks as diverse as driving cars, diagnosing diseases, and providing legal advice. The degree to which AI can improve outcomes in these and other domains depends on how comfortable people are trusting AI for these tasks, which in turn depends on lay perceptions of AI. The present research examines how these critical lay perceptions may vary as a function of conservatism. Using five survey experiments, we find that political conservatism is associated with low comfort with and trust in AI—i.e., with AI aversion. This relationship between conservatism and AI aversion is explained by the link between conservatism and risk perception; more conservative individuals perceive AI as being riskier and are therefore more averse to its adoption. Finally, we test whether a moral reframing intervention can reduce AI aversion among conservatives."

Therefore, its deficiency confers cellular sensitivity to UV radiation and an increased rate of UV-induced mutagenesis. Polη possesses a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (ubz) domain and a PCNA-interacting-protein (pip) motif in the carboxy-terminal region. The role of the Polη pip motif in PCNA interaction required for DNA polymerase recruitment to the stalled replication fork has been demonstrated in earlier studies; however, the function of the ubz domain remains divisive. As per the current notion, the ubz domain of Polη binds to the ubiquitin moiety of the ubiquitinated PCNA, but such interaction is found to be nonessential for Polη's function. In this study, through amino acid sequence alignments, we identify three classes of Polη among different species based on the presence or absence of pip motif or ubz domain and using comprehensive mutational analyses, we show that the ubz domain of Polη, which intrinsically lacks the pip motif directly binds to the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) of PCNA and regulates Polη's TLS activity. We further propose two distinct modes of PCNA interaction mediated either by pip motif or ubz domain in various Polη homologs. When the pip motif or ubz domain of a given Polη binds to the IDCL of PCNA, such interaction becomes essential, whereas the binding of ubz domain to PCNA through ubiquitin is dispensable for Polη's function.

They protect the stalled replication fork due to DNA lesion blockage from collapsing, prevent double-strand breaks and maintain an unperturbed cell cycle. The budding yeast possesses two Y family DNA pols—Polη and Rev1; whereas in humans, in addition to these, Polι and Polκ also replicate efficiently through distorting DNA lesions, albeit with low fidelity and low processivity (3Acharya N. Khandagale P. Thakur S. Sahu J.K. Utkalaja B.G. Quaternary structural diversity in eukaryotic DNA polymerases: Monomeric to multimeric form.Curr. Genet. 2020; 66: 635-655Google Scholar). Timely recruitment of specific TLS pols to a specific lesion site and their regulated activity determine the stability of a cell’s genome. Deciphering underlying mechanisms by which TLS pols gain access to the template–primer junction and take over synthesis from the replicative pol is crucial to understand the dynamic behavior of the replication fork during translesion DNA synthesis (4Acharya N. Patel S.K. Sahu S.R. Kumari P. 'PIPs' in DNA polymerase: PCNA interaction affairs.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2020; 48: 2811-2822Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans, genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that PCNA plays a pivotal role in the pol exchange process (5Freudenthal B.D. Gakhar L. Ramaswamy S.

A. 2008; 105: 5361-5366Google Scholar). The TLS pols gain access to the replication fork by physically interacting with PCNA, which is mediated by 1 to 2 highly conserved PCNA interacting protein (pip) motif(s) present mostly in the noncatalytic region of the pols (7Maga G. Hubscher U. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA): A dancer with many partners.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Google Scholar). Since TLS DNA polymerases are distributive in DNA synthesis, physical binding to PCNA increases their nucleotide incorporation efficiency on both undamaged and damaged DNA substrates without affecting their processivity (1Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Eukaryotic translesion synthesis DNA polymerases: Specificity of structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Google Scholar). A pip motif consists of a consensus sequence of eight amino acids QxxhxxFF(or YF/FY/YY/FL), where x is any amino acid, and h is any hydrophobic residue. PCNA interaction motifs have been mapped in all the Y-family polymerases from S. cerevisiae and humans, except in Rev1 (4Acharya N. Patel S.K. Sahu S.R. Kumari P. 'PIPs' in DNA polymerase: PCNA interaction affairs.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2020; 48: 2811-2822Google Scholar). While a single pip motif has been mapped in ScPolη and HsPolι, two pip motifs have been identified in human Pols-η and -κ (8Acharya N. Yoon J.H. Gali H. Unk I. Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Hurwitz J.

Unk I. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Physical and functional interactions of human DNA polymerase eta with PCNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7199-7206Google Scholar). Mutational inactivation of the ScPolη pip motif (621SKNILSFF628) abrogates its interaction with PCNA (11Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Physical and functional interactions of human DNA polymerase eta with PCNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7199-7206Google Scholar). Thereby, S. cerevisiae strains harboring F627A and F628A mutations in Polη exhibit enhanced UV sensitivity and UV-induced mutagenesis. In contrast to ScPolη, human Polη possesses two functional pips (437STDITSFL444 and 701MQTLESFF708) at the C-terminal domain (8Acharya N. Yoon J.H. Gali H. Unk I. Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Roles of PCNA-binding and ubiquitin-binding domains in human DNA polymerase eta in translesion DNA synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 17724-17729Google Scholar). Both the pips are functionally redundant and can substitute for one another. Only in the absence of both these motifs, HsPolη's interaction with PCNA on DNA, stimulation of its DNA synthetic activity, and colocalization with PCNA get abolished. In addition to the pip motif, several highly conserved ubiquitin (Ub)-binding domains (UBDs) have been identified in the C-terminal regions of Y-family pols, which regulate their TLS function (12Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding domains in Y-family polymerases regulate translesion synthesis.Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Google Scholar). While Polη carries a single Zn2+-binding UBD, i.e., ubz; Rev1, Pol-ι, and -κ possess two such motifs but without having Zn2+-binding ability (ubm). As PCNA gets monoubiquitinated via Rad6-Rad18 ubiquitination conjugating system during TLS (13Davies A.A. Ulrich H.D. Detection of PCNA modifications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Mol.

Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. RAD6-dependent DNA repair is linked to modification of PCNA by ubiquitin and SUMO.Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Google Scholar), it was proposed that the TLS polymerases bind to the ubiquitin moiety attached on PCNA through UBDs, and UBD-Ub-PCNA interaction is indispensable for the recruitment of TLS pols to PCNA. However, our subsequent mutational analysis in Sc- and Hs-Polη ruled out such a possibility, as mutations in the C2H2 motif or complete deletion of ubz domain had no perceivable effect on UV sensitivity or UV-induced mutagenesis (8Acharya N. Yoon J.H. Gali H. Unk I. Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Roles of PCNA-binding and ubiquitin-binding domains in human DNA polymerase eta in translesion DNA synthesis.Proc.

DNA polymerase eta lacking the ubiquitin-binding domain promotes replicative lesion bypass in humans cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 10401-10405Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that ubiquitin-binding on PCNA via its ubz domain is not a prerequisite for Polη to gain access to PCNA at the stalled replication site; rather, it may just function as a protein–protein interaction domain. Later studies reported that ubz binding to ub-PCNA increases Polη's retention time in the replication foci (19Kannouche P.L. Lehmann A.R. Ubiquitination of PCNA and the polymerase switch in human cells.Cell cycle. 2004; 3: 1011-1013Google Scholar, 20Brown S. Niimi A. Lehmann A.R.

Kannouche P.L. Green C.M. Translesion synthesis: Y-family polymerases and the polymerase switch.DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 891-899Google Scholar). Since the pip motif of Polη is an essential structural component for TLS activity, all Polη homologs should possess such PCNA interaction motifs. To look for the conservation of the pip motif and its function in Polη across the kingdom, 77 Polη amino acid sequences from the different genera were aligned. Interestingly, the C-terminal amino acid sequence of Polηs showed maximum variations, and some of the members lacked either pip motif or ubz domain (Table 1 and Fig. S1). They were classified into three distinct categories based on the presence or absence of pip motif and ubz domain. Out of 77, 34 Polηs from species of fungi (11 genera), animals (22 genera), and a single plant genus belong to category-I that harbor both pip and ubz in their C-terminal region. The category-I Polηs from Saccharomyces, human, and Xenopus have been studied (22Ishikawa T. Uematsu N. Mizukoshi T. Iwai S. Iwasaki H. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ueda R. Ohmori H. Todo T.

DNA polymerases eta and kappa are responsible for error-free translesion DNA synthesis activity over a cis-syn thymine dimer in Xenopus laevis oocyte extracts.DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 1252-1269Google Scholar). The Polηs from plant and protist sources possess pip motifs only in their C-terminal region and were grouped into category II (23 genera). It also implies that the role of the ubz domain of Polη is not evolutionarily conserved across the kingdom. Arabidopsis thaliana Polη has been studied, and its pip motif is essential for PCNA interaction and confers UV resistance in the rad30Δ mutant (24Anderson H.J. Vonarx E.J. Pastushok L. Nakagawa M. Katafuchi A. Gruz P. Di Rubbo A. Grice D.M. Osmond M.J. Sakamoto A.N. Nohmi T. Xiao W. Kunz B.A. Arabidopsis thaliana Y-family DNA polymerase eta catalyses translesion synthesis and interacts functionally with PCNA2.Plant J. 2008; 55: 895-908Google Scholar). To our surprise, we identified a group of Polηs only from fungi belonging to category III that seem to lack a pip motif at their usual location intrinsically. For example, Polηs from Candida albicans, Neurospora, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Aspergillus possess the highly conserved ubiquitin-binding C2H2 motif in their regulatory carboxyl tails, but not a pip motif. Since the pip motif is present in categories I and II Polηs and ubz is absent in category II, as demonstrated in S. cerevisiae, human, and Arabidopsis Polηs, the pip could be indispensable and ubz may be nonessential for the TLS function of Polηs in other organisms of these two categories as well. However, the recruitment of category III Polηs to the DNA lesion sites and their regulation by PCNA remain undetermined. Therefore in this study, we intended to decipher the underlying mechanism of the interaction of Polη from category III with PCNA. The S. cerevisiae RAD30 homolog from the pathogenic yeast C. albicans has been characterized. The complementation analysis suggested that CaPolη suppresses UV sensitivity and UV-induced mutagenesis in a Polη-deficient S. cerevisiae strain (25Satpati S. Manohar K. Acharya N. Dixit A.

By mutational analyses, we confirmed the absence of pip motif in CaPolη and provided the first conclusive evidence to suggest an indispensable role of the ubz domain of Polη in TLS function, which is also well supported by Polη from S. pombe. Further, considering previous reports and the current study, we suggest two modes of PCNA interaction by Polηs from various organisms.Table 1Classification of Polη from various organisms based on the presence or absence of pip motif and ubz domainSl.

Since similar to CaPolη, other 22 Polηs of category III also lack the pip motif (Table 1 and Fig. S1), one would presume that these Polηs either do not bind directly to PCNA or may have a different mode of PCNA interaction. To establish a direct physical interaction of CaPolη with CaPCNA, molecular size-exclusion chromatography was performed (Fig. 1B). The purified wild-type CaPolη protein (1–640 aa, ∼70 kDa) was mixed with CaPCNA in a 1:1 M ratio and allowed to resolve in analytical size-exclusion chromatography. For comparison, CaPCNA alone was also passed through the column, and its elution profile was recorded. As reported earlier also, CaPCNA (∼90 kDa) eluted as a trimer with an elution volume of ∼1.7 ml (29Manohar K. Acharya N. Characterization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from pathogenic yeast Candida albicans and its functional analyses in S. cerevisiae.BMC Microbiol. 2015; 15: 257Google Scholar). However, when the mixture of CaPolη-CaPCNA proteins was resolved, an early major elution peak at about ∼1.2 ml corresponding to a complex of Polη-PCNA and two smaller peaks at ∼1.7 ml and 2.4 ml elution volumes corresponding to free proteins were observed. The shifting of CaPCNA from 1.7 ml to 1.2 ml elution volume suggested that CaPCNA directly interacts and coelutes with CaPolη by forming a stable complex in solution and may regulate Polη's activity; hence warrants a detailed investigation. The direct interaction of CaPolη with CaPCNA implicated the involvement of yet unidentified pip motif or domain of CaPolη in PCNA binding. Four putative noncanonical pip sequences: Seq-1 (390SFVISNLF397), Seq-2 (479CVLIREFL486), Seq-3 (521SLTISKFV528), and Seq-4(547EEHIAKLF554) in and around the PAD of CaPolη may bind to PCNA (Fig. 1C). In addition, a unique proline-rich sequence located in between Seq-4 and ubz domain of CaPolη is observed that might provide additional structural flexibility to the C-terminal portion to be engaged in protein–protein interaction. To identify a region of CaPolη involved in PCNA interaction, we generated a deletion construct by inserting a stop codon at amino acid position 513 (K513) of CaPolη. The truncated CaPolη spanning residues 1 to 512 encodes for the whole catalytic domain up to the PAD (Fig. 1D), and similarly truncated Polηs both from S. cerevisiae and human are known to retain DNA polymerase activity as good as the full-length enzymes (8Acharya N.

Structure of the catalytic core of S. cerevisiae DNA polymerase eta: Implications for translesion DNA synthesis.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 417-426Google Scholar). The wild-type and truncated CaPolη were purified, and their interaction with CaPCNA was monitored by isothermal calorimetry (ITC) analysis. ITC allows estimating binding affinities between two proteins in the native environment. CaPCNA was injected into the sample cell of the calorimeter either containing wild-type or the catalytic domain of CaPolη 1 to 512 aa, and the binding between the two proteins was analyzed (Fig. 1E and Table 2). While the titration of CaPCNA against the full-length Polη resulted in an exothermic reaction, and the estimated values of ΔH, ΔG, and KD were −22.1 kcal/mol, −7.02 kcal/mol, and 7.15 μM, respectively, no perceivable change in the heat was detected when PCNA was titrated against the truncated CaPolη 1 to 512 aa or the buffer alone (Fig. S2). It suggested that the amino-terminal catalytic domain of CaPolη is not involved in PCNA interaction. Since CaPolη functionally complements ScPolη and protects the fungal cells from UV-induced DNA damages (17Acharya N. Brahma A. Haracska L. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Peroumal D. Acharya N. TLS dependent and independent functions of DNA polymerase eta (Poleta/Rad30) from pathogenic yeast Candida albicans.Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 110: 707-727Google Scholar), to further strengthen our finding, various Polη orfs were expressed under the constitutive ADH1 promoter in rad30Δ and rad30Δrev3Δ S. cerevisiae strains, and susceptibility to UV irradiation was determined. Polη and Polζ (Rev3-Rev7) function in the error-free and error-prone branches of TLS of UV lesions, respectively; therefore, double deletant S. cerevisiae (rad30Δrev3Δ) strain becomes hypersensitive to UV radiation than the individual null strain (31Torres-Ramos C.A. Prakash S. Prakash L. Requirement of RAD5 and MMS2 for postreplication repair of UV-damaged DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2419-2426Google Scholar). As depicted in Figure 1F, the truncated CaPolη 1 to 512 aa failed to complement the rad30 null strains of S. cerevisiae. The transformants carrying truncated CaPolη 1 to 512 aa showed severe growth impairment when they were irradiated to UV at different doses (16–32 J/m2), and the sensitivity was similar to that of the vector control. Thus, the catalytic domain consisting of the first 512 amino acids of CaPolη is insufficient to carry out lesion bypass in the cell as well as inefficient in PCNA binding. Moreover, a similar complementation assay with CaPolη F485A and L486A mutations that supported the growth of cells upon UV exposure ruled out the involvement of Seq-2 of PAD in PCNA interaction (Fig. 1F). These results implicated the requirement of the C-terminal domain region spanning residues 513 to 640 aa of CaPolη in TLS and possibly in PCNA interaction.Table: 2Kinetic parameters determination of PCNA binding with Polη or its peptide sequenceParametersCaPolη versus CaPCNAUbz peptide versus CaPCNAUbz peptide versus CaPCNA-90ScPolη versus ScPCNAUbz peptide versus ScPCNACell concentration10 μM20 μM20 μM10 μM20 μMSyringe concentration200 μM200 μM200 μM200 μM200 μMStoichiometry0.3150.3550.3160.310.34KD7.15 μM19.8 μM39 μM15.1 μM15. 6μMΔH−22.1−80−79.9−79.9−24.2ΔG−7.02−6.42−6.02−6.58−8.56−TΔS15.173.573.973.317.6 Open table in a new tab The above results indicated that the C-terminal portion of CaPolη containing two putative pip sequences: Seq-3 and Seq-4, and one ubz domain could be involved in PCNA interaction. To map the precise location of PCNA binding, another deletant CaPolη 1 to 601 aa was constructed that lacks the last 39 residues encompassing the ubz domain but retains Seq-3 and Seq-4 (Fig. 2A). Similar to CaPolη 1 to 512 aa, Polη 1 to 601 aa also conferred significant growth retardation at 16 to 32 J/m2 of UV irradiation in both rad30Δ and rad30Δrev3Δ S. cerevisiae strains implying that both Seq-3 and Seq-4 are not essential for CaPolη's TLS activity in the cell and are unlikely to be involved in PCNA interaction (Fig. 2B). Moreover, it suggested the critical role of the C-terminal 39 amino acids comprising the ubz domain of CaPolη in TLS activity. To ascertain the function of ubz domain, two D626A and H624A, H628A of CaPolη mutants were generated and their ability to suppress UV sensitivity of Polη-deficient S. cerevisiae strains was examined. Both the CaPolη mutants did not confer any cellular protection to UV radiation, and growth was inhibited drastically (Fig. 2B). The complementation analysis was reconfirmed by estimating the cell survivability upon UV exposure; where about 85 to 95% of cells expressing wild-type Polη conferred resistance, only ∼10 to 35% rad30Δ cells harboring CaPolη mutants survived after 32 J/m2 of UV treatment (Fig. 2C, i). Similarly, UV-induced mutation rate was estimated by counting the number of canavanine-resistant colonies of various S. cerevisiae strains harboring CaPolη constructs. The rad30Δ strain or strains harboring truncated or ubz mutants of CaPolη were highly mutagenic as more number colonies (∼4000 per 107 cells) grew as canavanine-resistant, as opposed to the strains expressing wild-type Polη (∼7"

Little empirical evidence exists about what refugees know about COVID-19 and what they do to prevent infection. This study explored what refugee women and their health care workers understand about COVID-19 prevention, the extent of their compliance to public health recommendations, and what influences the adoption of these measures. Methods In October 2020, we conducted 25 in-depth interviews with facility and community health care staff (n = 10) and refugee women attending antenatal and postnatal care services (n = 15) in Eastleigh, Nairobi. Findings While researchers found a high level of awareness about COVID-19 and related prevention and control measures among refugee women, various barriers affected compliance with such measures, due in part to poverty and in part to rampant misconceptions informed by religious beliefs and political narratives about the virus. Conclusions These findings indicated that Kenya’s Ministry of Health needs to institute a concerted and continuous education program to bring refugee communities up to speed about COVID-19 and its prevention. In addition to disseminating information about the need to wear masks and repeatedly wash hands, supplies—masks, soap and access to water—need to be made available to poor refugee communities. Future research could explore which measures for disseminating factual information work best in refugee populations with different cultural norms and how best to target interventions to these groups."
https://openalex.org/W4200159183,"Resistance arteries are small blood vessels that create resistance to blood flow. In hypertension, resistance arteries undergo remodeling, affecting their ability to contract and relax appropriately. To date, no study has mapped the hypertension-related proteomic changes in resistance arteries. Using a novel data-independent acquisition-mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) approach, we determined the proteomic changes in small mesenteric and renal arteries in pre- and early-onset hypertension from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, which represents human primary hypertension. Compared with normotensive controls, mesenteric arteries from 12-week-old SHRs had 286 proteins that were significantly up- or downregulated, whereas 52 proteins were identified as up- or downregulated in mesenteric arteries from 6-week-old SHRs. Of these proteins, 18 were also similarly regulated in SHR renal arteries. Our pathway analyses reveal several novel pathways in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Finally, using a matrisome database, we identified 38 altered extracellular-matrix-associated proteins, many of which have never previously been associated with hypertension. Taken together, this study reveals novel proteins and mechanisms that are associated with early-onset hypertension, thereby providing novel insights into disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W4200609598,"To help diagnose and initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥95% of all persons living with HIV (PLHIV), the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends offering HIV testing to biological children, and sexual and needle-sharing partners of all PLHIV (index-client testing, ICT). Many index clients, however, do not identify or have contactable partners, and often substantially fewer than 95% of HIV-positive partners initiate ART soon after index testing. To help improve early HIV diagnosis and ART initiation in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), we implemented a community-based HIV testing and peer-delivered, linkage case management program (CommLink) that provided ICT as part of a comprehensive package of WHO recommended linkage services. CommLink was implemented June 2015 –March 2017 (Phase I), and April 2017 –September 2018 (Phase II). In addition to biological children and partners, HIV testing was offered to adult family members (Phases I and II) and high-risk associates including friends and acquaintances (Phase II) of CommLink index clients. Compared with Phase I, in Phase II proportionally more CommLink clients disclosed their HIV-infection status to a partner or family member [94% (562/598) vs. 75% (486/652)], and had ≥1 partners, family members, or high-risk associates (contacts) tested through CommLink [41% (245/598) vs. 18% (117/652)]. Of 537 contacts tested, 253 (47%) were HIV-positive and not currently in HIV care, including 17% (17/100) of family members aged &lt;15 years, 42% (78/187) of non-partner family members aged ≥15 years, 60% (73/121) of sexual partners, and 66% (85/129) of high-risk associates. Among 210 HIV-positive contacts aged ≥15 years who participated in CommLink, nearly all received recommended linkage services including treatment navigation (95%), weekly telephone follow-up (93%), and ≥3 counseling sessions (94%); peer counselors resolved 76% (306/404) of identified barriers to care (e.g., perceived wellness); and 200 (95%) initiated ART at a healthcare facility, of whom 196 (98%) received at least one antiretroviral refill before case-management services ended. To help countries achieve ≥90% ART coverage among all PLHIV, expanding ICT for adult family members and high-risk associates of index clients, and providing peer-delivered linkage case management for all identified PLHIV, should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4226424306,"The binding between β-lactoglobulin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) under the pressure of 600 MPa was explored using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. EGCG bound mainly in two regions with site 1 in internal cavity of the β-barrel and site 2 on the surface of protein. 150 ns MD was performed starting from the structure with the optimal binding energy at the two sites in molecular docking, respectively. It was found that the protein fluctuated greatly when small molecule bound to site 2 at 0.1 MPa, and the protein fluctuation and solvent accessible surface area became smaller under high-pressure. The binding of small molecules made the protein structure more stable with increasing of α-helix and β-sheet, while high-pressure destroyed α-helix of protein. The binding energy of small molecules at site 1was stronger than that at site 2 under 0.1 MPa, with stronger van der Waals and hydrophobic interaction at site 1 while more hydrogen bonds were present at site 2. The binding energy of both sites weakened under high-pressure, especially at site 1, causing the binding force to be weaker at site 1 than that at site 2 under high-pressure."
https://openalex.org/W4200041212,"Introduction The safety and quality of patient care are basic guidelines in finding new and improved solutions in nursing. Important and influential factors shape the nurses’ work environment in hospitals. Purpose With the study, we intended to investigate whether the perception of nurses’ work environment is related to the safety culture and the quality of patient care and whether it differs according to nurses’ level of education. Methods of work The study with a quantitative research method was conducted at the six clinical departments of the University Medical Centre, Ljubljana in 2019. We used a survey questionnaire from the European survey Nurse forecasting in Europe (RN4CAST). Results 270 nurses were included in the study. The response rate was 54%. The study confirmed that there is a correlation between the assessment of the nurses’ work environment and the general assessment of patient safety (r = 0.36; p &lt;0.001), the general assessment of the quality of nursing care (r = 0.32; p &lt;0.001), the confidence in patient self-care at discharge (r = 0.29; p &lt;0.001) and the quality of patient care in the previous year (r = 0.27; p = 0.001). The results showed frequent verbal abuse of nurses, in 44.9% by patients and their relatives and in 35.4% by staff. Graduate nurses rated the work environment more negatively than healthcare technicians (p = 0.003). Discussion and conclusion We confirmed the correlation between the assessment of nurses’ work environment and patient safety and the quality of health care, and that employees’ education influences the assessment and perception of the work environment."
https://openalex.org/W4200116652,"International guidelines propose color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) as primary imaging techniques in the diagnosis of acute splanchnic vein thrombosis. However, their reliability in this context is poorly investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to validate CDUS and CT in the radiologic assessment of acute splanchnic vein thrombosis, using direct transjugular spleno-portography as gold standard.49 patients with non-malignant acute splanchnic vein thrombosis were included in a retrospective, multicenter analysis. The thrombosis' extent in five regions of the splanchnic venous system (right and left intrahepatic portal vein, main trunk of the portal vein, splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein) and the degree of thrombosis (patent, partial thrombosis, complete thrombosis) were assessed by portography, CDUS and CT in a blinded manner. Reliability of CDUS and CT with regard to portography as gold standard was analyzed by calculating Cohen's kappa.Results of CDUS and CT were consistent with portography in 76.6% and 78.4% of examinations, respectively. Cohen's kappa demonstrated that CDUS and CT delivered almost equally reliable results with regard to the portographic gold standard (k = 0.634 [p < 0.001] vs. k = 0.644 [p < 0.001]). In case of findings non-consistent with portography there was no clear trend to over- or underestimation of the degree of thrombosis in both CDUS (60.0% vs. 40.0%) and CT (59.5% vs. 40.5%).CDUS and CT are equally reliable tools in the radiologic assessment of non-malignant acute splanchnic vein thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W4200427942,"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a common condition in hospitalized patients, yet its epidemiology in the ICU remains poorly characterized.Retrospective cohort of patients admitted to the Nantes University Hospital ICU between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019, and coded for AWS using ICD-10 criteria. The objective of the study was to identify factors associated with complicated hospital stay defined as ICU length of stay ≥7 days or hospital mortality.Among 5,641 patients admitted to the ICU during the study period, 246 (4.4%) were coded as having AWS. Among them, 42 had exclusion criteria and 204 were included in the study. The three main reasons for ICU admission were sepsis (29.9%), altered consciousness (29.4%), and seizures (24%). At ICU admission, median Cushman's score was 6 [4-9] and median SOFA score was 3 [2-6]. Delirium tremens occurred in half the patients, seizures in one fifth and pneumonia in one third. Overall, 48% of patients developed complicated hospital stay, of whom 92.8% stayed in the ICU for ≥7 days, 36.7% received MV for ≥7 days, and 16.3% died during hospital stay. By multivariable analysis, two factors were associated with complicated hospital stay: a higher number of organ dysfunctions at ICU admission was associated with a higher risk of complicated hospital stay (OR, 1.18; 95CI, 1.05-1.32, P = 0.005), whereas ICU admission for seizures was associated with a lower risk of complicated hospital stay (OR, 0.14; 95%CI, 0.026-0.80; P = 0.026).AWS in ICU patients chiefly affects young adults and is often associated with additional factors such as sepsis, trauma, or surgery. Half the patients experienced an extended ICU stay or death during the hospital stay. The likelihood of developing complicated hospital stay relied on the reason for ICU admission and the number of organ dysfunctions at ICU admission."
https://openalex.org/W4200479245,"The unrelated protein families of the microbial formate-nitrite transporters (FNTs) and aquaporins (AQP) likely adapted the same protein fold through convergent evolution. FNTs facilitate weak acid anion/H+ cotransport, whereas AQP water channels strictly exclude charged substrates including protons. The FNT channel-like transduction pathway bears two lipophilic constriction sites that sandwich a highly conserved histidine residue. Because of lacking experiments, the function of these constrictions is unclear, and the protonation status of the central histidine during substrate transport remains a matter of debate. Here, we introduced constriction-widening mutations into the prototypical FNT from Escherichia coli, FocA, and assayed formate/H+ transport properties, water/solute permeability, and proton conductance. We found that enlargement of these constrictions concomitantly decreased formate/formic acid transport. In contrast to wildtype FocA, the mutants were unable to make use of a transmembrane proton gradient as a driving force. A construct in which both constrictions were eliminated exhibited water permeability, similar to AQPs, although accompanied by a proton conductance. Our data indicate that the lipophilic constrictions mainly act as barriers to isolate the central histidine from the aqueous bulk preventing protonation via proton wires. These results are supportive of an FNT transport model in which the central histidine is uncharged, and weak acid substrate anion protonation occurs in the vestibule regions of the transporter before passing the constrictions."
https://openalex.org/W4200487557,"Bacterial transporters are difficult to study using conventional electrophysiology because of their low transport rates and the small size of bacterial cells. Here, we applied solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology to derive kinetic parameters of sugar translocation by the Escherichia coli xylose permease (XylE), including functionally relevant mutants. Many aspects of the fucose permease (FucP) and lactose permease (LacY) have also been investigated, which allow for more comprehensive conclusions regarding the mechanism of sugar translocation by transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. In all three of these symporters, we observed sugar binding and transport in real time to determine KM, Vmax, KD, and kobs values for different sugar substrates. KD and kobs values were attainable because of a conserved sugar-induced electrogenic conformational transition within these transporters. We also analyzed interactions between the residues in the available X-ray sugar/H+ symporter structures obtained with different bound sugars. We found that different sugars induce different conformational states, possibly correlating with different charge displacements in the electrophysiological assay upon sugar binding. Finally, we found that mutations in XylE altered the kinetics of glucose binding and transport, as Q175 and L297 are necessary for uncoupling H+ and d-glucose translocation. Based on the rates for the electrogenic conformational transition upon sugar binding (>300 s-1) and for sugar translocation (2 s-1 - 30 s-1 for different substrates), we propose a multiple-step mechanism and postulate an energy profile for sugar translocation. We also suggest a mechanism by which d-glucose can act as an inhibitor for XylE."

Moench] production is severely affected by anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum sublineolum Henn. New sources of anthracnose resistance should be identified to introgress novel genes into susceptible varieties in resistance breeding programs. The objective of this study was to determine genome-wide association of Diversity Arrays Technology Sequencing (DArTseq) based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers and anthracnose resistance genes in diverse sorghum populations for resistance breeding. Three hundred sixty-six sorghum populations were assessed for anthracnose resistance in three seasons in western Ethiopia using artificial inoculation. Data on anthracnose severity and the relative area under the disease progress curve were computed. Furthermore, the test populations were genotyped using SNP markers with DArTseq protocol. Population structure analysis and genome-wide association mapping were undertaken based on 11,643 SNPs with <10% missing data. The evaluated population was grouped into eight distinct genetic clusters. A total of eight significant (P < 0.001) marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected, explaining 4.86-15.9% of the phenotypic variation for anthracnose resistance. Out of which the four markers were above the cutoff point. The significant MTAs in the assessed sorghum population are useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in anthracnose resistance breeding programs and for gene and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping."
https://openalex.org/W4200053735,"Background Hepatitis B infection is a major health concern in Myanmar. Hepatitis B birth dose vaccination to prevent mother-to-child transmission is not universal, especially in births outside of health care facilities. Little is documented about delivery of immunization programs in rural Myanmar or in conflict-affected regions. To address this gap, this study describes the implementation of a novel community delivered neonatal hepatitis B immunization program in rural Karenni State, Myanmar. Methods A mixed-methods study assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of hepatitis B birth dose immunization program. 1000 pregnant women were screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection using point of care testing. Neonates of HBV positive mothers were immunized with a three dose HBV vaccine schedule at birth, 1, and 6 months of age. HBV testing was completed for children at 9 months to assess for infection. Descriptive statistics were collected including demographic data of mothers, neonatal vaccination schedule completion, and child HBV positivity at 9 months. Qualitative data examining barriers to implementation were collected through semi-structured interviews, participant-observation, and analysis of program documents. Themes were codified and mapped onto the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Results 46 pregnant women tested HBV positive leading to 40 live births. 39 women-child dyads were followed until the 9-month age mark. With the exception of two neonates who received their birth dose past 24 hours, all children received their vaccines on time. None of the 39 children tested positive for HBV at nine months. Themes regarding barriers included adaptability of the program to the rural setting, friction with other stakeholders and not meeting all needs of the community. Identified strengths included good communication and leadership within the implementing ethnic health organization. Conclusion A community delivered neonatal HBV vaccination program by ethnic health organizations is feasible and effective in rural Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W4200156182,"A network of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is involved in the activation of (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a plant hormone that regulates plant defense responses as well as plant growth and development. In the absence of JA-Ile, inhibitory protein jasmonate-ZIM-domain (JAZ) represses JA-related transcription factors, including a master regulator, MYC. In contrast, when JA-Ile accumulates in response to environmental stresses, PPI occurs between JAZ and the F-box protein COI1, which triggers JAZ degradation, resulting in derepressed MYC that can interact with the transcriptional mediator MED25 and upregulate JA-Ile-related gene expression. Activated JA signaling is eventually suppressed through the catabolism of JA-Ile and feedback suppression by JAZ splice variants containing a cryptic MYC-interacting domain (CMID). However, the detailed structural basis of some PPIs involved in JA-Ile signaling remains unclear. Herein, we analyzed PPI between MYC3 and MED25, focusing on the key interactions that activate the JA-Ile signaling pathway. Biochemical assays revealed that a short binding domain of MED25 (CMIDM) is responsible for the interaction with MYC, and that a bipartite interaction is critical for the formation of a stable complex. We also show the mode of interaction between MED25 and MYC is closely related to that of CMID and MYC. In addition, quantitative analyses on the binding of MYC3-JAZs and MYC3-MED25 revealed the order of binding affinity as JAZJas < MED25CMIDM < JAZCMID, suggesting a mechanism for how the transcriptional machinery causes activation and negative feedback regulation during jasmonate signaling. These results further illuminate the transcriptional machinery responsible for JA-Ile signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4200327585,"In HIV, the polyprotein precursor Gag orchestrates the formation of the viral capsid. In the current view of this viral assembly, Gag forms low-order oligomers that bind to the viral genomic RNA triggering the formation of high-ordered ribonucleoprotein complexes. However, this assembly model was established using biochemical or imaging methods that do not describe the cellular location hosting Gag-gRNA complex nor distinguish gRNA packaging in single particles. Here, we studied the intracellular localization of these complexes by electron microscopy and monitored the distances between the two partners by morphometric analysis of gold beads specifically labeling Gag and gRNA. We found that formation of these viral clusters occurred shortly after the nuclear export of the gRNA. During their transport to the plasma membrane, the distance between Gag and gRNA decreases together with an increase of gRNA packaging. Point mutations in the zinc finger patterns of the nucleocapsid domain of Gag caused an increase in the distance between Gag and gRNA as well as a sharp decrease of gRNA packaged into virions. Finally, we show that removal of stem loop 1 of the 5'-untranslated region does not interfere with gRNA packaging, whereas combined with the removal of stem loop 3 is sufficient to decrease but not abolish Gag-gRNA cluster formation and gRNA packaging. In conclusion, this morphometric analysis of Gag-gRNA cluster formation sheds new light on HIV-1 assembly that can be used to describe at nanoscale resolution other viral assembly steps involving RNA or protein-protein interactions."

In the current study we have employed streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic transgenic Ins1Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP and GluCreERT2;Rosa26-eYFP mice, to evaluate the impact of sustained Ac3IV treatment on pancreatic islet cell morphology and transdifferentiation. Twice-daily administration of Ac3IV (25 nmol/kg bw) to STZ-diabetic Ins1Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice for 12 days increased pancreatic insulin (p<0.01) and significantly reversed the detrimental effects of STZ on pancreatic islet morphology. Such benefits were coupled with increased (p<0.01) beta-cell proliferation and decreased (p<0.05) beta-cell apoptosis. In terms of islet cell lineage tracing, induction of diabetes increased (p<0.001) beta- to alpha-cell differentiation in Ins1Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, with Ac3IV partially reversing (p<0.05) such transition events. Comparable benefits of Ac3IV on pancreatic islet architecture were observed in STZ-diabetic GluCreERT2;ROSA26-eYFP transgenic mice. In this model, Ac3IV provoked improvements in islet morphology which were linked to increased (p<0.05-p<0.01) transition of alpha- to beta-cells. Ac3IV also increased (p<0.05-p<0.01) CK-19 co-expression with insulin in pancreatic ductal and islet cells. Blood glucose levels were unchanged by Ac3IV in both models, reflecting the severity of diabetes induced. Taken together these data indicate that activation of islet receptors for V1a and V1b positively modulates alpha- and beta-cell turnover and endocrine cell lineage transition events to preserve beta-cell identity and islet architecture."
https://openalex.org/W4200597326,"Previous studies targeting inter-individual differences in pain processing in migraine mainly focused on the perception of pain. Our main aim was to disentangle pain anticipation and perception using a classical fear conditioning task, and investigate how migraine frequency and pre-scan cortisol-to-dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) ratio as an index of neurobiological stress response would relate to neural activation in these two phases. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data of 23 participants (18 females; mean age: 27.61± 5.36) with episodic migraine without aura were analysed. We found that migraine frequency was significantly associated with pain anticipation in brain regions comprising the midcingulate and caudate, whereas pre-scan cortisol-to DHEA-S ratio was related to pain perception in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Both results suggest exaggerated preparatory responses to pain or more general to stressors, which may contribute to the allostatic load caused by stressors and migraine attacks on the brain."

The different contra-sound effects between noise and music stimuli on N1m responses of auditory-evoked fields and those on psychophysical response were examined in 12 and 15 subjects, respectively. In the magnetoencephalographic study, the stimulus to elicit the N1m response was a tone burst of 500 ms duration at a frequency of 250 Hz, presented at a level of 70 dB, and white noise filtered with high-pass filter at 2000 Hz and music stimuli filtered with high-pass filter at 2000 Hz were used as contralateral noise. The contralateral stimuli (noise or music) were presented in 10 dB steps from 80 dB to 30 dB. Subjects were instructed to focus their attention to the left ear and to press the response button each time they heard burst stimuli presented to the left ear. In the psychophysical study, the effects of contralateral sound presentation on the response time for detection of the probe sound of a 250 Hz tone burst presented at a level of 70 dB were examined for the same contra-noise and contra-music used in the magnetoencephalographic study. The amplitude reduction and latency delay of N1m caused by contra-music stimuli were significantly larger than those by contra-noise stimuli in bilateral hemisphere, even for low level of contra-music near the psychophysical threshold. Moreover, this larger suppressive effect induced by contra-music effects was also observed psychophysically; i.e., the change in response time for detection of the probe sound was significantly longer by adding contralateral music stimuli than by adding contra-noise stimuli. Regarding differences in effect between contra-music and contra-noise, differences in the degree of saliency may be responsible for their different abilities to disturb auditory attention to the probe sound, but further investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W4200234615,"Research on geographic differences in health focuses largely on children less than five years; little is known about adolescents-and even less regarding younger adolescents-a vulnerable group at a critical stage of the life course. Africa's rapid population growth and urbanization rates, coupled with stagnant rates of undernutrition, further indicate the need for country-specific data on rural-urban health disparities to inform development policies. This study examined rural-urban disparities in body mass index-for-age-and-sex (BAZ) and height-for-age-and-sex z-scores (HAZ) among younger adolescents in Tanzania. Participants were randomly selected adolescents aged 10-14 years (N = 1,125) residing in Kilosa (rural) and Moshi (urban) districts of Tanzania. Individual and household-level data were collected using surveys and anthropometric data was collected on all adolescents. Age, sex, household living conditions, and assets were self-reported. BAZ and HAZ were calculated using the WHO reference guide. The prevalence of undernutrition was 10.9% among rural and 5.1% among urban adolescents (p<0.001). Similarly, stunting prevalence was greater in rural (64.5%) than urban (3.1%) adolescents (p<0.001). After adjusting for covariates, rural residence was significantly and inversely associated with BAZ (B = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.52, -0.70, p = 0.01), as well as with HAZ (B = -1.79, 95% CI: -2.03, -1.54, p<0.001). Self-identified males had lower BAZ (B = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.34, -0.11, p<0.001) and HAZ (B = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.35, -0.09, p = 0.001) than self-identified female adolescents. Rural-urban disparities in nutritional status were significant and gendered. Findings confirm place of residence as a key determinant of BAZ and HAZ among younger adolescents in Tanzania. Targeted gender-sensitive interventions are needed to limit growth faltering and improve health outcomes in rural settings."
https://openalex.org/W4200242692,"Strabismus is one of the most common visual disorders in children, with a reported prevalence of 2.48% in preschoolers. Additionally, up to 89.9% of preschool children with strabismus do not have normal stereopsis. Whether this lack of normal stereopsis affects the motor competency of preschool children with strabismus is unknown. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency Second Edition short form (BOT-2 SF) can be a useful tool for screening; however, its sufficiency as a diagnostic tool for children with various disorders is controversial.The aims of this study were thus to examine motor competency in preschool children with strabismus by using the BOT-2 and to evaluate the usefulness of the BOT-2 SF to identify those at risk for motor competency issues.Forty preschool children (aged 5-7 years) with strabismus were recruited, all of whom had abnormal stereopsis. The BOT-2 complete form (CF) was administered to all children. The BOT-2 CF was administered to all children. The scores of the BOT-2 SF were extracted from the relevant items of the BOT-2 CF for further analysis.The prevalence of children with strabismus who had below average performance in the composites of ""Fine Manual Control"", ""Manual Coordination"",""Body Coordination"", and ""Strength and Agility"" were 15%, 70%, 32.5%, and 5%, respectively, on the BOT-2 CF. Compared with these results, the sensitivity of the BOT-2 SF was 33.33% (95% CI = 7.49%-70.07%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI = 88.78%-100%).Preschool children with strabismus had a high prevalence of impaired motor competency, especially in fine motor competency. The BOT-2 SF was not as sensitive in identifying motor difficulties in preschool children with strabismus. Therefore, the BOT-2 CF is recommended for evaluating motor proficiency in preschool children with strabismus."
https://openalex.org/W4200340671,"The mean square displacement (MSD) is an important statistical measure on a stochastic process or a trajectory. In this paper we find an approximation to the mean square displacement for a model of cell motion. The model is a discrete-time jump process which approximates a force-based model for cell motion. In cell motion, the mean square displacement not only gives a measure of overall drift, but it is also an indicator of mode of transport. The key to finding the approximation is to find the mean square displacement for a subset of the state space and use it as an approximation for the entire state space. We give some intuition as to why this is an unexpectedly good approximation. A lower bound and upper bound for the mean square displacement are also given. We show that, although the upper bound is far from the computed mean square displacement, in rare cases the large displacements are approached."
https://openalex.org/W4200365738,"Local and regional trade networks in small-scale fisheries are important for food security and livelihoods across the world. Such networks consist of both economic flows and social relationships, which connect different production regions to different types of fish demand. The structure of such trade networks, and the actions that take place within them (e.g., people fishing, buying, selling), can influence the capacity of small-scale fisheries to provide sufficient fish in a changing social and ecological context. In this study, we aim to understand the importance of networks between different types of traders that access spatially-distinct fish stocks for the availability and variability of fish provision. We deployed a mixed-methods approach, combining agent-based modelling, network analysis and qualitative data from a small-scale fishery in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The empirical data allowed us to investigate the trade processes that occur within trade networks; and the generation of distinct, empirically-informed network structures. Formalized in an agent-based model, these network structures enable analysis of how different trade networks affect the dynamics of fish provision and the exploitation level of fish stocks. Model results reveal how trade strategies based on social relationships and species diversification can lead to spillover effects between fish species and fishing regions. We found that the proportion of different trader types and their spatial connectivity have the potential to increase fish provision. However, they can also increase overexploitation depending on the specific connectivity patterns and trader types. Moreover, increasing connectivity generally leads to positive outcomes for some individual traders, but this does not necessarily imply better outcomes at the system level. Overall, our model provides an empirically-grounded, stylized representation of a fisheries trading system, and reveals important trade-offs that should be considered when evaluating the potential effect of future changes in regional trade networks."
https://openalex.org/W4200419561,"Citrus blackfly, Aleurocanthus woglumi Ashby (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is an important agricultural quarantine pest, causing substantial economic losses to citrus and many other cultivated crops. Aleurocanthus woglumi is found in tropical and subtropical regions but is presently unknown in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. We used CLIMEX to model the potential distribution of A. woglumi under an historical climate scenario (centred on 1995), including a spatially explicit irrigation scenario. We found that A. woglumi could potentially invade the Mediterranean Basin, and south-east Asia, including Australia. There is potential for it to invade most of sub-Saharan Africa. Irrigation is revealed as an important habitat factor affecting the potential distribution of A. woglumi, increasing its potential range by 53% in Asia. Under a future climate scenario for 2050, its potential distribution increased across all continents except Africa, where potential range expansion due to relaxation of cold stresses was limited, and was offset by range decrease due to lethal heat or dry stress. As global climates warm, Europe is likely to face a substantial increase in the area at risk of establishment by A. woglumi (almost doubling under the 2050 irrigation scenario). The biosecurity threat from A. woglumi is significant in current citrus production areas and poses a challenge to biosecurity managers and risk analysts."
https://openalex.org/W4200560019,"New Zealand's rate of suicide persistently exceeds the global average. The burden of suicide in New Zealand is disproportionately borne by youth, males and Māori (NZ indigenous people). While the demographic characteristics of suicide decedents are established, there is a need to identify potential points of contact with health services where preventative action could take place. This paper aims to determine if suicide deaths in New Zealand were likely to be preceded by contact with health services, and the type and time frame in which these contacts took place. This study utilised a whole-of-population-cohort of all individuals age 15 years and over, who were alive on March 5th 2013, followed up to December 2015. Associations between the odds of suicide, demographic factors, area-based deprivation, and the timing of last contact with primary, secondary, and tertiary services were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Contact with a health service in the 6 Months prior to death was associated with the highest odds of suicide. Over half of the suicide decedent population (59.4%) had contacted primary health services during this period. Large proportions of the suicide decedent population contacted secondary and tertiary services in the 6 Months prior to death, 46.5% and 30.4% respectively. Contact with primary, secondary and tertiary services in the prior 6 Months, were associated with an increased odds of suicide of 2.51 times [95% CI 2.19-2.88], 4.45 times [95% CI 3.69-4.66] and 6.57 times [95% CI 5.84-7.38], respectively, compared to those who had no health services contact."
https://openalex.org/W3118272877,"We study a self-reflexive DSGE model with heterogeneous households, aimed at characterising the impact of economic recessions on the different strata of the society. Our framework allows to analyse the combined effect of income inequalities and confidence feedback mediated by heterogeneous social networks. By varying the parameters of the model, we find different crisis typologies: loss of confidence may propagate mostly within high income households, or mostly within low income households, with a rather sharp transition between the two. We find that crises are more severe for segregated networks (where confidence feedback is essentially mediated between agents of the same social class), for which cascading contagion effects are stronger. For the same reason, larger income inequalities tend to reduce, in our model, the probability of global crises. Finally, we are able to reproduce a perhaps counter-intuitive empirical finding: in countries with higher Gini coefficients, the consumption of the lowest income households tends to drop less than that of the highest incomes in crisis times."
https://openalex.org/W4200134833,"There is evidence to suggest that people with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) can have altered body representations and spatial cognition. One way of studying these cognitive functions is through manual straight ahead (MSA) pointing, in which participants are required to point straight ahead of their perceived body midline without visual feedback of the hand. We therefore compared endpoint errors from MSA pointing between people with CRPS (n = 17) and matched controls (n = 18), and examined the effect of the arm used (Side of Body; affected/non-dominant, non-affected/dominant). For all participants, pointing errors were biased towards the hand being used. We found moderate evidence of no difference between Groups on endpoint errors, and moderate evidence of no interaction with Side of Body. The differences in variability between Groups were non-significant/inconclusive. Correlational analyses showed no evidence of a relationship between MSA endpoint errors and clinical parameters (e.g. CRPS severity, duration, pain) or questionnaire measures (e.g. body representation, ""neglect-like symptoms"", upper limb disability). This study is consistent with earlier findings of no difference between people with CRPS and controls on MSA endpoint errors, and is the first to provide statistical evidence of similar performance of these two groups. Our results do not support a relationship between clinical or self-reported measures (e.g. ""neglect-like symptoms"") and any directional biases in MSA. Our findings may have implications for understanding neurocognitive changes in CRPS."
https://openalex.org/W4200270113,"Recognition of human autophagy-related 8 (hATG8) proteins by autophagy receptors represents a critical step within this cellular quality control system. Autophagy impairment is known to be a pathogenic mechanism in the motor neuron disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Overlapping but specific roles of hATG8 proteins belonging to the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies are incompletely understood, and binding selectivity is typically overlooked. We previously showed that an ALS-associated variant of the SQSTM1/p62 (p62) autophagy receptor bearing an L341V mutation within its ATG8-interacting motif (AIM) impairs recognition of LC3B in vitro, yielding an autophagy-deficient phenotype. Improvements in understanding of hATG8 recognition by AIMs now distinguish LC3-interaction and GABARAP-interaction motifs and predict the effects of L341V substitution may extend beyond loss of function to biasing AIM binding preference. Through biophysical analyses, we confirm impaired binding of the L341V-AIM mutant to LC3A, LC3B, GABARAP, and GABARAPL1. In contrast, p62 AIM interactions with LC3C and GABARAPL2 are unaffected by this mutation. Isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR investigations provided insights into the entropy-driven GABARAPL2/p62 interaction and how the L341V mutation may be tolerated. Competition binding demonstrated reduced association of the L341V-AIM with one hATG8 manifests as a relative increase in association with alternate hATG8s, indicating effective reprogramming of hATG8 selectivity. These data highlight how a single AIM peptide might compete for binding with different hATG8s and suggest that the L341V-AIM mutation may be neomorphic, representative of a disease mechanism that likely extends into other human disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4200327036,"Research suggests that a jumping-to-conclusions (JTC) bias, excessive intuition, and reduced analysis in information processing may favor suboptimal decision-making, both in non-clinical and mentally disordered individuals. The temporal relationship between processing modes and JTC bias, however, remains unexplored. Therefore, using an experience sampling methodology (ESM) approach, this study examines the temporal associations between intuitive/analytical information processing, JTC bias, and delusions in non-clinical individuals and patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, we examine whether a high use of intuitive and/or a low use of analytical processing predicts subsequent JTC bias and paranoid conviction. In a smartphone-based ESM study, participants will be prompted four times per day over three consecutive days to answer questionnaires designed to measure JTC bias, paranoid conviction, and preceding everyday-life intuition/analysis. Our hierarchical data will be analyzed using multilevel modelling for hypothesis testing. Results will further elucidate the role of aberrant human reasoning, particularly intuition, in (non-)clinical delusions and delusion-like experiences, and also inform general information processing models."
