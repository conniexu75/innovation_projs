https://openalex.org/W2008026660,"To generate the most diverse phylogenetic dataset for the flaviviruses to date, we determined the genomic sequences and phylogenetic relationships of 14 flaviviruses, of which 10 are primarily associated with Culex spp. mosquitoes. We analyze these data, in conjunction with a comprehensive collection of flavivirus genomes, to characterize flavivirus evolutionary and biogeographic history in unprecedented detail and breadth. Based on the presumed introduction of yellow fever virus into the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade, we extrapolated a timescale for a relevant subset of flaviviruses whose evolutionary history, shows that different Culex-spp. associated flaviviruses have been introduced from the Old World to the New World on at least five separate occasions, with 2 different sets of factors likely to have contributed to the dispersal of the different viruses. We also discuss the significance of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in a central region of the polyprotein open reading frame in some mosquito-associated flaviviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2026584286,"Purpose Assess prevalence of myopia and identify associated risk factors in urban school children. Methods This was a cross-sectional study screening children for sub-normal vision and refractive errors in Delhi. Vision was tested by trained health workers using ETDRS charts. Risk factor questionnaire was filled for children with vision <6/9.5, wearing spectacles and for a subset (10%) of randomly selected children with normal vision. All children with vision <6/9.5 underwent cycloplegic refraction. The prevalence of myopia <-0.5 diopters was assessed. Association of risk factors and prevalence of myopia was analyzed for children with myopia and randomly selected non myopic children and adjusted odds ratio values for all risk factors were estimated. Results A total number of 9884 children were screened with mean age of 11.6 + 2.2 years and 66.8% boys. Prevalence of myopia was 13.1% with only 320 children (24.7%) wearing appropriate spectacles. Mean myopic spherical error was -1.86 + 1.4 diopters. Prevalence of myopia was higher in private schools compared to government schools (p<0.001), in girls vs. boys (p = 0.004) and among older (> 11 years) children (p<0.001). There was a positive association of myopia with studying in private schools vs. government schools (p<0.001), positive family history (p< 0.001) and higher socio-economic status (p = 0.037). Positive association of presence of myopia was observed with children studying/reading > 5 hours per day (p < 0.001), watching television > 2 hours / day (p < 0.001) and with playing computer/video/mobile games (p < 0.001). An inverse association with outdoor activities/playing was observed with children playing > 2 hours in a day. Conclusion Myopia is a major health problem in Indian school children. It is important to identify modifiable risk factors associated with its development and try to develop cost effective intervention strategies."

Methods National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network (CCRN) funding and number of patients recruited to NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN) portfolio studies for each NHS Trusts were used as markers of research activity. Patient-level data for adult non-elective admissions were extracted from the English Hospital Episode Statistics (2005-10). Risk-adjusted mortality associations between Trust structures, research activity and, clinical outcomes were investigated. Results Low mortality Trusts received greater levels of funding and recruited more patients adjusted for size of Trust (n = 35, 2,349 £/bed [95% CI 1,855–2,843], 5.9 patients/bed [2.7–9.0]) than Trusts with expected (n = 63, 1,110 £/bed, [864–1,357] p<0.0001, 2.6 patients/bed [1.7–3.5] p<0.0169) or, high (n = 42, 930 £/bed [683–1,177] p = 0.0001, 1.8 patients/bed [1.4–2.1] p<0.0005) mortality rates. The most research active Trusts were those with more doctors, nurses, critical care beds, operating theatres and, made greater use of radiology. Multifactorial analysis demonstrated better survival in the top funding and patient recruitment tertiles (lowest vs. highest (odds ratio & 95% CI: funding 1.050 [1.033–1.068] p<0.0001, recruitment 1.069 [1.052–1.086] p<0.0001), middle vs. highest (funding 1.040 [1.024–1.055] p<0.0001, recruitment 1.085 [1.070–1.100] p<0.0001). Conclusions Research active Trusts appear to have key differences in composition than less research active Trusts. Research active Trusts had lower risk-adjusted mortality for acute admissions, which persisted after adjustment for staffing and other structural factors."

The cohort of Mayak Production Association (PA) workers in Russia offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of prolonged low dose rate external gamma exposures and exposure to plutonium in a working age population. We examined radiation effects on the risk of mortality from solid cancers excluding sites of primary plutonium deposition (lung, liver, and bone surface) among 25,757 workers who were first employed in 1948–1982. During the period 1948–2008, there were 1,825 deaths from cancers other than lung, liver and bone. Using colon dose as a representative external dose, a linear dose response model described the data well. The excess relative risk per Gray for external gamma exposure was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.07 – 0.26) when unadjusted for plutonium exposure and 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 – 0.21) when adjusted for plutonium dose and monitoring status. There was no significant effect modification by sex or attained age. Plutonium exposure was not significantly associated with the group of cancers analyzed after adjusting for monitoring status. Site-specific risks were uncertainly estimated but positive for 13 of the 15 sites evaluated with a statistically significant estimate only for esophageal cancer. Comparison with estimates based on the acute exposures in atomic bomb survivors suggests that the excess relative risk per Gray for prolonged external exposure in Mayak workers may be lower than that for acute exposure but, given the uncertainties, the possibility of equal effects cannot be dismissed."
https://openalex.org/W2113706113,"Across cultures, taller stature is linked to increased social status, but the potential reasons why this should be are unclear. One potential explanation is that taller individuals are more likely to win a dyadic confrontation with a competitor (i.e., they are more dominant), which leads to higher social rank. Although some previous studies have shown that perceptions of status or dominance are related to height, and are therefore consistent with such an explanation, there is surprisingly little research testing whether height actually has any influence on the behavioural outcomes in real-life social interactions. Here, we present three naturalistic observational studies demonstrating that height predicts interpersonal dominance during brief dyadic interactions. Study 1 investigated the likelihood of giving way in a narrow passage (N = 92); Study 2 investigated giving way in a busy shopping street, plus the likelihood of colliding with another individual (N = 1,108); and Study 3 investigated the likelihood of maintaining a linear path while walking, and potentially entering another individual’s personal space (N = 1,056). We conclude that human height is positively related to interpersonal dominance, and may well contribute to the widely observed positive association between height and social status."

https://openalex.org/W2102301864,"Synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents with different mechanisms of action have been introduced as more successful strategies to combat infections involving multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. In this study, we investigated synergistic antimicrobial activity of Camellia sinensis and Juglans regia which are commonly used plants with different antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial susceptibility of 350 Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains belonging to 10 different bacterial species, was tested against Camellia sinensis and Juglans regia extracts. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by agar dilution and microbroth dilution assays. Plant extracts were tested for synergistic antimicrobial activity with different antimicrobial agents by checkerboard titration, Etest/agar incorporation assays, and time kill kinetics. Extract treated and untreated bacteria were subjected to transmission electron microscopy to see the effect on bacterial cell morphology. Camellia sinensis extract showed higher antibacterial activity against MDR S. Typhi, alone and in combination with nalidixic acid, than to susceptible isolates.” We further explore anti-staphylococcal activity of Juglans regia that lead to the changes in bacterial cell morphology indicating the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria as possible target of action. The synergistic combination of Juglans regia and oxacillin reverted oxacillin resistance of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in vitro. This study provides novel information about antimicrobial and synergistic activity of Camellia sinensis and Juglans regia against MDR pathogens"
https://openalex.org/W2115294037,"Improved molecular diagnostic methods for detection drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains are required. Resistance to first- and second- line anti-tuberculous drugs has been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in particular genes. However, these SNPs can vary between MTB lineages therefore local data is required to describe different strain populations. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize 37 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) MTB isolates from Pakistan and investigated 40 genes associated with drug resistance. Rifampicin resistance was attributable to SNPs in the rpoB hot-spot region. Isoniazid resistance was most commonly associated with the katG codon 315 (92%) mutation followed by inhA S94A (8%) however, one strain did not have SNPs in katG, inhA or oxyR-ahpC. All strains were pyrazimamide resistant but only 43% had pncA SNPs. Ethambutol resistant strains predominantly had embB codon 306 (62%) mutations, but additional SNPs at embB codons 406, 378 and 328 were also present. Fluoroquinolone resistance was associated with gyrA 91–94 codons in 81% of strains; four strains had only gyrB mutations, while others did not have SNPs in either gyrA or gyrB. Streptomycin resistant strains had mutations in ribosomal RNA genes; rpsL codon 43 (42%); rrs 500 region (16%), and gidB (34%) while six strains did not have mutations in any of these genes. Amikacin/kanamycin/capreomycin resistance was associated with SNPs in rrs at nt1401 (78%) and nt1484 (3%), except in seven (19%) strains. We estimate that if only the common hot-spot region targets of current commercial assays were used, the concordance between phenotypic and genotypic testing for these XDR strains would vary between rifampicin (100%), isoniazid (92%), flouroquinolones (81%), aminoglycoside (78%) and ethambutol (62%); while pncA sequencing would provide genotypic resistance in less than half the isolates. This work highlights the importance of expanded targets for drug resistance detection in MTB isolates."

Here we report that increased levels of IFNβ were found in testes from mice deficient in MOV10L1, a germ cell-specific RNA helicase that plays a key role in limiting the propagation of retrotransposons including Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1). Additional experiments revealed that activation of LINE-1 retrotransposons increases the expression of IFNβ and of IFN-stimulated genes. Conversely, pretreatment of cells with IFN suppressed the replication of LINE-1. Furthermore, the efficacy of LINE-1 replication was increased in isogenic cell lines harboring inactivating mutations in diverse elements of the IFN signaling pathway. Knockdown of the IFN receptor chain IFNAR1 also stimulated LINE-1 propagation in vitro. Finally, a greater accumulation of LINE-1 was found in mice that lack IFNAR1 compared with wild type mice. We propose that LINE-1-induced IFN plays an important role in restricting LINE-1 propagation and discuss the putative role of IFN in preserving the genome stability.

https://openalex.org/W1983453266,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed for 136 indoor dust samples collected from Guizhou province, southwest of China. The ∑18PAHs concentrations ranged from 2.18 μg•g-1 to 14.20 μg•g-1 with the mean value of 6.78 μg•g-1. The highest Σ18PAHs concentration was found in dust samples from orefields, followed by city, town and village. Moreover, the mean concentration of Σ18PAHs in indoor dust was at least 10% higher than that of outdoors. The 4-6 rings PAHs, contributing more than 70% of ∑18PAHs, were the dominant species. PAHs ratios, principal component analysis with multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were applied to evaluate the possible sources. Two major origins of PAHs in indoor dust were identified as vehicle emissions and coal combustion. The mean incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) due to human exposure to indoor dust PAHs in city, town, village and orefield of Guizhou province, China was 6.14×10-6, 5.00×10-6, 3.08×10-6, 6.02×10-6 for children and 5.92×10-6, 4.83×10-6, 2.97×10-6, 5.81×10-6 for adults, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2016128192,"In collectivist cultures, families tend to be characterized by respect for parental authority and strong, interdependent ties. Do these aspects of collectivism exert countervailing pressures on mate choices and relationship quality? In the present research, we found that collectivism was associated with greater acceptance of parental influence over mate choice, thereby driving relationship commitment down (Studies 1 and 2), but collectivism was also associated with stronger family ties (referred to as family allocentrism), which drove commitment up (Study 2). Along similar lines, Study 1 found that collectivists’ greater acceptance of parental influence on mate choice contributed to their reduced relationship passion, whereas Study 2 found that their greater family allocentrism may have enhanced their passion. Study 2 also revealed that collectivists may have reported a smaller discrepancy between their own preferences for mates high in warmth and trustworthiness and their perception of their parents’ preferences for these qualities because of their stronger family allocentrism. However, their higher tolerance of parental influence may have also contributed to a smaller discrepancy in their mate preferences versus their perceptions of their parents’ preferences for qualities signifying status and resources. Implications for the roles of collectivism, parental influence, and family allocentrism in relationship quality and mate selection will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1985776518,"Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen of medical significance, using multiple virulence factors to cause disease. A prophylactic S. aureus 4-antigen (SA4Ag) vaccine comprising capsular polysaccharide (types 5 and 8) conjugates, clumping factor A (ClfA) and manganese transporter C (MntC) is under development. This study was designed to characterize S. aureus isolates recovered from infected patients and also to investigate approaches for examining expression of S. aureus vaccine candidates and the host response during human infection. Confirmation of antigen expression in different disease states is important to support the inclusion of these antigens in a prophylactic vaccine. Hospitalized patients with diagnosed S. aureus wound (27) or bloodstream (24) infections were enrolled. Invasive and nasal carriage S. aureus isolates were recovered and characterized for genotypic diversity. S. aureus antigen expression was evaluated directly by real-time, quantitative, reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and indirectly by serology using a competitive Luminex immunoassay. Study isolates were genotypically diverse and all had the genes encoding the antigens present in the SA4Ag vaccine. S. aureus nasal carriage was detected in 55% of patients, and in those subjects 64% of the carriage isolates matched the invasive strain. In swab samples with detectable S. aureus triosephosphate isomerase housekeeping gene expression, RNA transcripts encoding the S. aureus virulence factors ClfA, MntC, and capsule polysaccharide were detected by qRT-PCR. Antigen expression was indirectly confirmed by increases in antibody titer during the course of infection from acute to convalescent phase. Demonstration of bacterial transcript expression together with immunological response to the SA4Ag antigens in a clinically relevant patient population provides support for inclusion of these antigens in a prophylactic vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2050648080,"Soil acidification is the main problem in the current rice production. Here, the effects of low pH on the root growth, reactive oxygen species metabolism, plasma membrane functions, and the transcript levels of the related genes were investigated in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) in a hydroponic system at pH 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5. There were two hybrid rice cultivars in this trial, including Yongyou 12 (YY12, a japonica hybrid) and Zhongzheyou 1 (ZZY1, an indica hybrid). Higher H+ activity markedly decreased root length, the proportion of fine roots, and dry matter production, but induced a significant accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and led to serious lipid peroxidation in the roots of the two varieties. The transcript levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (Cu/Zn SOD1), copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 2 (Cu/Zn SOD2), catalase A (CATA) and catalase B (CATB) genes in YY12 and ZZY1 roots were significantly down-regulated after low pH exposure for two weeks. Meanwhile, a significant decrease was observed in the expression of the P-type Ca2+-ATPases in roots at pH 3.5. The activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT) and plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+-ATPase in the two varieties were dramatically inhibited by strong rhizosphere acidification. However, the expression levels of ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1) and PM H+-ATPase isoform 7 were up-regulated under H+ stress compared with the control. Significantly higher activities of APX and PM H+-ATPase could contribute to the adaptation of rice roots to low pH."
https://openalex.org/W2019316405,"Background Surgery is the only curative treatment in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM), but only 10–20% of patients are eligible. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) technology is of proven value in several indications, notably prostate cancer. Its intra-operative use in patients with CLM has not previously been studied. Preclinical work suggested the safety and feasibility of a new HIFU device capable of ablating volumes of up to 2cm x 2cm in a few seconds. Methods We conducted a prospective, single-centre phase I-IIa trial. HIFU was delivered immediately before scheduled hepatectomy. To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of rapidly ablating liver parenchyma, ablations were performed on healthy tissue within the areas scheduled for resection. Results In total, 30 ablations were carried out in 15 patients. These ablations were all generated within 40 seconds and on average measured 27.5mm x 21.0mm. The phase I study (n = 6) showed that use of the HIFU device was feasible and safe and did not damage neighbouring tissue. The phase IIa study (n = 9) showed both that the area of ablation could be precisely targeted on a previously implanted metallic mark (used to represent a major anatomical structure) and that ablations could be undertaken deliberately to avoid such a mark. Ablations were achieved with a precision of 1–2 mm. Conclusion HIFU was feasible, safe and effective in ablating areas of liver scheduled for resection. The next stage is a phase IIb study which will attempt ablation of small metastases with a 5 mm margin, again prior to planned resection. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.govNCT01489787"
https://openalex.org/W2073551094,"High temperature (HT, heat) stress is detrimental to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. Wild relatives of bread wheat may offer sources of HT stress tolerance genes because they grow in stressed habitats. Wheat chromosome translocation lines, produced by introgressing small segments of chromosome from wild relatives to bread wheat, were evaluated for tolerance to HT stress during the grain filling stage. Sixteen translocation lines and four wheat cultivars were grown at optimum temperature (OT) of 22/14°C (day/night). Ten days after anthesis, half of the plants were exposed to HT stress of 34/26°C for 16 d, and other half remained at OT. Results showed that HT stress decreased grain yield by 43% compared with OT. Decrease in individual grain weight (by 44%) was the main reason for yield decline at HT. High temperature stress had adverse effects on leaf chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm; and a significant decrease in Fv/Fm was associated with a decline in individual grain weight. Based on the heat response (heat susceptibility indices, HSIs) of physiological and yield traits to each other and to yield HSI, TA5594, TA5617, and TA5088 were highly tolerant and TA5637 and TA5640 were highly susceptible to HT stress. Our results suggest that change in Fv/Fm is a highly useful trait in screening genotypes for HT stress tolerance. This study showed that there is genetic variability among wheat chromosome translocation lines for HT stress tolerance at the grain filling stage and we suggest further screening of a larger set of translocation lines."
https://openalex.org/W2000350957,"Movement is a key mean for mobile species to cope with heterogeneous environments. While in herbivorous mammals large-scale migration has been widely investigated, fine-scale movement responses to local variations in resources and predation risk remain much less studied, especially in savannah environments. We developed a novel approach based on complementary movement metrics (residence time, frequency of visits and regularity of visits) to relate movement patterns of a savannah grazer, the blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, to fine-scale variations in food availability, predation risk and water availability in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Wildebeests spent more time in grazing lawns where the grass is of higher quality but shorter than in seep zones, where the grass is of lower quality but more abundant. Although the daily distances moved were longer during the wet season compared to the dry season, the daily net displacement was lower, and the residence time higher, indicating a more frequent occurrence of area-concentred searching. In contrast, during the late dry season the foraging sessions were more fragmented and wildebeests moved more frequently between foraging areas. Surprisingly, predation risk appeared to be the second factor, after water availability, influencing movement during the dry season, when resources are limiting and thus expected to influence movement more. Our approach, using complementary analyses of different movement metrics, provided an integrated view of changes in individual movement with varying environmental conditions and predation risk. It makes it possible to highlight the adaptive behavioral decisions made by wildebeest to cope with unpredictable environmental variations and provides insights for population conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2026315886,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (HTT). The primary neuropathology of HD has been attributed to the preferential degeneration of medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the striatum. Reports on striatal neurogenesis have been a subject of debate; nevertheless, it should be considered as an endogenous attempt to repair the brain. The subventricular zone (SVZ) might offer a close-by region to supply the degenerated striatum with new cells. Previously, we have demonstrated that R6/2 mice, a widely used preclinical model representing an early onset HD, showed reduced olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis but induced striatal migration of neuroblasts without affecting the proliferation of neural progenitor cell (NPCs) in the SVZ. The present study revisits these findings, using a clinically more relevant transgenic rat model of late onset HD (tgHD rats) carrying the human HTT gene with 51 CAG repeats and mimicking many of the neuropathological features of HD seen in patients. We demonstrate that cell proliferation is reduced in the SVZ and OB of tgHD rats compared to WT rats. In the OB of tgHD rats, although cell survival was reduced, the frequency of neuronal differentiation was not altered in the granule cell layer (GCL) compared to the WT rats. However, an increased frequency of dopamenergic neuronal differentiation was noticed in the glomerular layer (GLOM) of tgHD rats. Besides this, we observed a selective proliferation of neuroblasts in the adjacent striatum of tgHD rats. There was no evidence for neuronal maturation and survival of these striatal neuroblasts. Therefore, the functional role of these invading neuroblasts still needs to be determined, but they might offer an endogenous alternative for stem or neuronal cell transplantation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2031360665,"Background Codonopsis pilosula (Franch.) Nannf. is one of the most widely used medicinal plants. Although chemical and pharmacological studies have shown that codonopsis polysaccharides (CPPs) are bioactive compounds and that their composition is variable, their biosynthetic pathways remain largely unknown. Next-generation sequencing is an efficient and high-throughput technique that allows the identification of candidate genes involved in secondary metabolism. Principal Findings To identify the components involved in CPP biosynthesis, a transcriptome library, prepared using root and other tissues, was assembled with the help of Illumina sequencing. A total of 9.2 Gb of clean nucleotides was obtained comprising 91,175,044 clean reads, 102,125 contigs, and 45,511 unigenes. After aligning the sequences to the public protein databases, 76.1% of the unigenes were annotated. Among these annotated unigenes, 26,189 were assigned to Gene Ontology categories, 11,415 to Clusters of Orthologous Groups, and 18,848 to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Analysis of abundance of transcripts in the library showed that genes, including those encoding metallothionein, aquaporin, and cysteine protease that are related to stress responses, were in the top list. Among genes involved in the biosynthesis of CPP, those responsible for the synthesis of UDP-L-arabinose and UDP-xylose were highly expressed. Significance To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a public transcriptome dataset prepared from C. pilosula and an outline of the biosynthetic pathway of polysaccharides in a medicinal plant. Identified candidate genes involved in CPP biosynthesis provide understanding of the biosynthesis and regulation of CPP at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2021392273,"Introduction The aim of present study was to profile the glucose-dependent and glutamine- dependent metabolism in pancreatic cancer. Methods We performed Immunohistochemical staining of GLUT1, CAIX, BNIP3, p62, LC3, GLUD1, and GOT1. Based on the expression of metabolism-related proteins, the metabolic phenotypes of tumors were classified into two categories, including glucose- and glutamine-dependent metabolism. There were Warburg type, reverse Warburg type, mixed type, and null type in glucose-dependent metabolism, and canonical type, non-canonical type, mixed type, null type in glutamine-dependent metabolism. Results Longer overall survival was associated with high expression of BNIP3 in tumor (p = 0.010). Shorter overall survival was associated with high expression of GLUT1 in tumor (P = 0.002) and GOT1 in tumor (p = 0.030). Warburg type of glucose-dependent metabolism had a highest percentage of tumors with nerve infiltration (P = 0.0003), UICC stage (P = 0.0004), and activated autophagic status in tumor (P = 0.0167). Mixed type of glucose-dependent metabolism comprised the highest percentage of tumors with positive marginal status (P<0.0001), lymphatic invasion (P<0.0001), and activated autophagic status in stroma (P = 0.0002). Mixed type and Warburg type had a significant association with shorter overall survival (P = 0.018). Non-canonical type and mixed type of glutamine-dependent metabolism comprised the highest percentage of tumors with vascular invasion (p = 0.0073), highest percentage of activated autophagy in tumors (P = 0.0034). Moreover, these two types of glutamine-dependent metabolism were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (P<0.001). Further analysis suggested that most of tumors were dependent on both glucose- and glutamine-dependent metabolism. After dividing the tumors according to the number of metabolism, we found that the increasing numbers of metabolism subtypes inversely associated with survival outcome. Conclusion Warburg type, non-canonical type and mixed types of glucose- and glutamine-dependent metabolism comprised of more metabolically active, biologically aggressive and poor prognostic tumors. Moreover, the increasing subtypes and categories of the metabolism in each tumor significantly associated with poor prognosis."

Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) is an antifibrotic cytokine that antagonizes TGF-β1, and isolated studies have demonstrated that HA can both mediate and modulate BMP7 responses. In this study, we investigated whether BMP7 can modulate HA in a manner that leads to prevention/reversal of TGF-β1-driven myofibroblast differentiation in human lung fibroblasts. Results demonstrated that BMP7 prevented and reversed TGF-β1-driven myofibroblast differentiation through a novel mechanism. BMP7 promoted the dissolution and internalization of cell-surface HA into cytoplasmic endosomes. Endosomal HA co-localized with the HA-degrading enzymes, hyaluronidase-1 and hyaluronidase-2 (Hyal2). Moreover, BMP7 showed differential regulation of CD44 standard and variant isoform expression, when compared with TGF-β1. In particular, BMP7 increased membrane expression of CD44v7/8. Inhibiting CD44v7/8 as well as blocking Hyal2 and the Na+/H+ exchanger-1 at the cell-surface prevented BMP7-driven HA internalization and BMP7-mediated prevention/reversal of myofibroblast phenotype. In summary, a novel mechanism of TGF-β1 antagonism by BMP7 is shown and identifies alteration in HA as critical in mediating BMP7 responses.

Moreover, BMP7 showed differential regulation of CD44 standard and variant isoform expression, when compared with TGF-β1. In particular, BMP7 increased membrane expression of CD44v7/8. Inhibiting CD44v7/8 as well as blocking Hyal2 and the Na+/H+ exchanger-1 at the cell-surface prevented BMP7-driven HA internalization and BMP7-mediated prevention/reversal of myofibroblast phenotype. In summary, a novel mechanism of TGF-β1 antagonism by BMP7 is shown and identifies alteration in HA as critical in mediating BMP7 responses. In addition, we identify Hyal2 and CD44v7/8 as new potential targets for manipulation in prevention and reversal of fibrotic pathology. Background: Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) can prevent/reverse fibrosis, but mechanisms are unclear. Results: BMP7 prevents/reverses myofibroblast formation through cell-surface hyaluronan internalization into catalytic endosomes. Hyaluronidase-2 and variant CD44v7/8 mediate this process. Conclusion: Alterations in hyaluronan are critical in prevention/reversal of myofibroblast differentiation. Significance: A novel mechanism of BMP7 action is described and identifies CD44v7/8 and hyaluronidase-2 as potential targets in preventing fibrotic pathology. Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that demonstrates reduced expression in progressive renal diseases. Studies in animal models of renal disease, including ischemic reperfusion injury, unilateral urethral obstruction, nephrotoxin-induced glomerulonephritis, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy, have shown that BMP7 can both prevent and reverse renal fibrosis (1.Hruska K.A.

It is synthesized by three mammalian HA synthase isoenzymes (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3), and its breakdown is mediated by the hyaluronidase (Hyal) group of enzymes.

TGF-β1 stimulation directs HAS2-driven assembly of HA into pericellular coats, which promotes membrane redistribution of CD44. This results in its physical co-localization with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequent selective activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway necessary for myofibroblast formation (12.Simpson R.M. Wells A. Thomas D. Stephens P. Steadman R. Phillips A. Aging fibroblasts resist phenotypic maturation because of impaired hyaluronan-dependent CD44/epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.Am. J.

Numerous reports have indicated that HA assembly and its conformation within the pericellular matrix are crucial in determining its subsequent biological actions. For example, interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated formation of HA pericellular protrusions promotes fibroblast immune activation through fibroblast-monocyte interactions, whereas pericellular HA cable-like structures are shown to be anti-inflammatory and prevent monocyte-dependent inflammatory cytokine production (28.Meran S. Martin J. Luo D.D. Steadman R. Phillips A. Interleukin-1β induces hyaluronan and CD44-dependent cell protrusions that facilitate fibroblast-monocyte binding.Am. J.

Thus, it is clear that under specific biological contexts HA may also have the ability to function in the prevention of disease. There is some evidence that HA can both mediate and modulate BMP7 responses. In chondrocytes, BMP7-dependent Smad1 signaling was mediated through CD44-Smad1 interactions (30.Andhare R.A. Takahashi N. Knudson W. Knudson C.B. Hyaluronan promotes the chondrocyte response to BMP-7.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2009; 17: 906-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that pericellular HA augments BMP7 Smad signaling (31.Peterson R.S. Andhare R.A. Rousche K.T. Knudson W. Wang W. Grossfield J.B. Thomas R.O. Hollingsworth R.E. Knudson C.B. CD44 modulates Smad1 activation in the BMP-7 signaling pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In renal epithelial cells, BMP7 has also been shown to induce the formation of HA cables (32.Selbi W. de la Motte C. Hascall V. Phillips A. BMP-7 modulates hyaluronan-mediated proximal tubular cell-monocyte interaction.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, whether HA plays a specific role in BMP7-mediated antagonism of TGF-β1 actions is not known. In this work, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in which BMP7 reverses TGF-β1 induction of myofibroblast differentiation in human lung fibroblast cultures by internalizing pericellular HA into catalytic endosomes within the cytoplasm and preventing TGF-β1-driven pericellular HA accumulation. The CD44 variant isoform, CD44v7/8, and membrane-bound Hyal2 are both critical for this process of HA internalization and thus potentially present new targets for study and intervention in fibrosis. All reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) or Life Technologies and Invitrogen (Paisley, UK) unless otherwise stated. Reverse transcription reagents, siRNA transfection reagents, and quantitative PCR (QPCR) primers and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems (Cheshire, UK). Other reagents used were recombinant human BMP7 (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), and the selective NHE1 inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA; Sigma). Human lung fibroblasts (AG02262) were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and F12 containing 5 mm glucose, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries Ltd., Cumbernauld, UK). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, and fresh growth medium was added to the cells every 3 to 4 days until the cells were ready for experimentation. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h before use in all experiments, and all experiments were performed under serum-free conditions unless otherwise stated. All experiments were undertaken using cells at passage 6–10. Phenotypic differentiation of fibroblasts was induced by stimulation with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 72 h according to time course and dose-response experiments and according to our previous protocols (33.Meran S. Thomas D. Stephens P. Martin J. Bowen T. Phillips A. Steadman R. Involvement of hyaluronan in regulation of fibroblast phenotype.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25687-25697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Time course and dose-response experiments were also initially done to determine the optimum concentration and incubation times with BMP7. A dose of 400 ng/ml BMP7 was subsequently used in all experiments. Two experimental cell systems were utilized to determine effects of BMP7 and related alterations in HA on TGF-β1 responsiveness, a prevention model and a reversal model of fibrosis. For the prevention model, cells were either treated with TGF-β1 and BMP7 at the same time (prevention I) or cells were pretreated with BMP7 prior to stimulation with TGF-β1 (prevention II). For the reversal model, cells were first stimulated with TGF-β1 to induce differentiation and then subsequently treated with BMP7.

Briefly, conditioned cell culture medium was removed and transferred into Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes (soluble HA) and kept on ice. Cells were then incubated with trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes, and trypsin was deactivated by heating to 90 °C for 5 min (cell-surface HA) and then kept on ice. The cell pellet was resuspended in dilute (10% v/v) RIPA buffer and kept on ice for 10 min. The solution was centrifuged again, and the supernatant transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes (intracellular HA). Samples were then analyzed by Corgenix HA ELISA kits (Corgenix), according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-QPCR was used to assess α-SMA (ACTA2), CD44, Hyal1, Hyal2, HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 mRNA expressions. Primers and probes for these genes were commercially designed and purchased from Applied Biosystems. The cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and washed with PBS before lysis with TRI Reagent and RNA purification according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was done using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). This kit uses the random primer method for initiating cDNA synthesis. As a negative control, reverse transcription was done with sterile H2O replacing the RNA sample. QPCR was done using the ViiA7 real time QPCR system from Applied Biosystems in a final volume of 20 μl per sample as follows: 1 μl of reverse transcription product, 1 μl of target gene primers and probe, 10 μl of TaqMan Fast Universal PCR MasterMix, and 8 μl of sterile RNase-free water. Amplification was done using a cycle of 95 °C for 1 s and 60 °C for 20 s for 40 cycles. QPCR was simultaneously performed for ribosomal RNA (primers and probe commercially designed and purchased from Applied Biosystems) as a standard reference gene. For assessment of CD44 variant isoform expression, custom primer pairs were designed and purchased from Invitrogen. Primer pairs used are shown in Table 2.TABLE 2Forward and reverse primer pairs for CD44 standard and variant isoformsCD44sForward 5′-GCTACCAGAGACCAAGACACA-3′Reverse 5′-GCTCCACCTTCTTGACTCC-3′CD44v7Forward 5′-GAATCCCTGCTACCACAGCCTC-3′Reverse 5′-TCTCCCATCCTTCTTCCTGCTT-3′CD44v8Forward 5′-ATGTGTCTTGGTCTCGCGTT-3′Reverse 5′TCCCTGCTACCAATATGGACTC-3′CD44v3/7Forward 5′-TTATCTCCAGCACCACAGCCTC-3′Reverse 5′-TCTTGGTCTCCCATCCTTCTTC-3′CD44v7/8Forward 5′AGGAAGAAGGATGGATATGGACT-3′Reverse 5′-GTCTTGGTCTCGCGTTGTCA-3′ Open table in a new tab QPCR for custom primer pairs was done with the ViiA7 real time QPCR system from Applied Biosystems in a final volume of 20 μl per sample as follows: 1 μl of reverse transcription product; 0.6 μl of 10 μm target gene forward primer and 0.6 μl of 10 μm target gene reverse primer; 10 μl of Power SYBR Green Mastermix; and 7.8 μl of sterile RNase-free water. Amplification used a cycle of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles, followed by a melt-curve stage at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and a final step of 95 °C for 15 s. QPCR was simultaneously performed for GAPDH mRNA expression (custom primers designed and purchased from Applied Biosystems) as a standard reference gene. As a negative control, PCR was performed with sterile H2O replacing the cDNA sample. The comparative CT method was used for relative quantification of gene expression. The CT (threshold cycle where amplification is in the linear range of the amplification curve) for the standard reference gene (rRNA/GAPDH) was subtracted from the target gene CT to obtain the ΔCT. The mean ΔCT values for replicate samples were then calculated. The expression of the target gene in experimental samples relative to expression in control samples was then calculated using the following equation: 2−(ΔCT(1) − ΔCT(2)), where ΔCT(1) is the mean ΔCT calculated for the experimental samples, and ΔCT(2) is the mean ΔCT calculated for the control samples. Transient transfection of fibroblasts was done with specific siRNA nucleotides (Applied Biosystems) targeting Hyal1, Hyal2, or CD44v7/8. Transfection was done using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were grown to 70% confluence in antibiotic-free medium in either 35-mm dishes or 8-well Permanox chamber slides. Transfection reagent (2% v/v) was diluted in Opti-MEM reduced growth medium (GIBCO) and left to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. The specific siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted in Opti-MEM reduced growth medium to achieve a final concentration of 30 nm. The transfection agent and siRNA mixtures were then combined and incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The newly formed transfection complexes were subsequently added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h in serum-free medium before experimentation. As a control, cells were transfected with negative control siRNA (a scrambled sequence that bears no homology to the human genome) (Applied Biosystems). Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 8-well Permanox chamber slides. The culture medium was removed, and the cells washed with sterile PBS before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h before a further washing step with 0.1% (w/v) BSA in PBS. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in 0.1% BSA and PBS for 2 h at room temperature. When visualizing HA, biotinylated HA-binding protein (bHABP) was used in place of primary antibody. After a further washing step, slides were incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated and/or AlexaFluor 555-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Avidin-FITC was used in place of a secondary antibody when visualizing HA. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst solution. Cells were then mounted and analyzed by confocal and fluorescent microscopy. A co-localization scatter plot was used to quantify the level of co-localization present between distinct antibody stains in selected experiments. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-human α-SMA (Sigma); rat anti-human CD44 antibody (Merck Millipore; A020); mouse anti-human EGFR antibody (Merck Millipore); biotinylated bHABP (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan); mouse anti-human EEA1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Heidelberg, Germany); mouse anti-human Cav1 antibody (Sigma); rabbit anti-human Hyal1 antibody and rabbit anti-human Hyal2 antibody (gift from Dr. Robert Stern, Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco); mouse anti-human CD44v7/8 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Leicestershire, UK); and cholera toxin subunit B Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The following secondary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-rat AlexaFluor 555, goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488, goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488, goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 555 (Merck Millipore); and avidin-FITC (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Specific primer pairs were designed and purchased (Invitrogen) to target CD44v7 and CD44v8. Two primer sets were used for CD44v7 analysis as follows: set one forward 5′-TCAATGCTTCAGCTCCACCT-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTCCCATCCTTCTTCCTGCTT-3′; set two forward 5′-GAATCCCTGCTACCACAGCCTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAAAGCCAAGGCCAAGAGGGATGC-3′.

https://openalex.org/W2078271584,"Interspecific hybridization often induces epigenetic remodeling that leads to transposon activation, gene expression changes, and loss of imprinting. These genomic changes can be deleterious and contribute to postzygotic hybrid incompatibility. In Arabidopsis, loss of genomic imprinting of PHERES1 and presumed failure of Polycomb Repressive Complex contributes to seed inviability observed in A. thaliana X A. arenosa interspecific hybrids. We used this species pair to further analyze the relationship between parentally biased gene expression and postzygotic hybrid incompatibility using two A. thaliana accessions, Col-0 and C24, with differential seed survival. We found that parentally biased expression was perturbed to a similar degree in both A. thaliana hybrids for PHERES1, HDG3, and six other normally paternally expressed genes. We propose that early genome remodeling and loss of imprinting of seed development genes induces lethality in both compatible and incompatible hybrids."

Isolated patient-derived CD133+ LM cells expressed stem cell genes (NANOG, Oct4), circulating endothelial cell precursor proteins (CD90, CD146, c-Kit, VEGFR-2), and lymphatic endothelial proteins (podoplanin, VEGFR-3). Consistent with a progenitor cell identity, CD133+ LM cells were multipotent and could be differentiated into fat, bone, smooth muscle, and lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro. CD133+ cells were compared to CD133− cells isolated from LM fluids. CD133− LM cells had lower expression of stem cell genes, but expressed circulating endothelial precursor proteins and high levels of lymphatic endothelial proteins, VE-cadherin, CD31, podoplanin, VEGFR-3 and Prox1. CD133− LM cells were not multipotent, consistent with a differentiated lymphatic endothelial cell phenotype. In a mouse xenograft model, CD133+ LM cells differentiated into lymphatic endothelial cells that formed irregularly dilated lymphatic channels, phenocopying human LMs. In vivo, CD133+ LM cells acquired expression of differentiated lymphatic endothelial cell proteins, podoplanin, LYVE1, Prox1, and VEGFR-3, comparable to expression found in LM patient tissues. Taken together, these data identify a novel LM progenitor cell population that differentiates to form the abnormal lymphatic structures characteristic of these lesions, recapitulating the human LM phenotype. This LM progenitor cell population may contribute to the clinically refractory behavior of LMs."
https://openalex.org/W2086242930,"Background The sea slug Tritonia diomedea (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Nudibranchia), has a simple and highly accessible nervous system, making it useful for studying neuronal and synaptic mechanisms underlying behavior. Although many important contributions have been made using Tritonia, until now, a lack of genetic information has impeded exploration at the molecular level. Results We performed Illumina sequencing of central nervous system mRNAs from Tritonia, generating 133.1 million 100 base pair, paired-end reads. De novo reconstruction of the RNA-Seq data yielded a total of 185,546 contigs, which partitioned into 123,154 non-redundant gene clusters (unigenes). BLAST comparison with RefSeq and Swiss-Prot protein databases, as well as mRNA data from other invertebrates (gastropod molluscs: Aplysia californica, Lymnaea stagnalis and Biomphalaria glabrata; cnidarian: Nematostella vectensis) revealed that up to 76,292 unigenes in the Tritonia transcriptome have putative homologues in other databases, 18,246 of which are below a more stringent E-value cut-off of 1x10-6. In silico prediction of secreted proteins from the Tritonia transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) produced a database of 579 unique sequences of secreted proteins, which also exhibited markedly higher expression levels compared to other genes in the TSA. Conclusions Our efforts greatly expand the availability of gene sequences available for Tritonia diomedea. We were able to extract full length protein sequences for most queried genes, including those involved in electrical excitability, synaptic vesicle release and neurotransmission, thus confirming that the transcriptome will serve as a useful tool for probing the molecular correlates of behavior in this species. We also generated a neurosecretome database that will serve as a useful tool for probing peptidergic signalling systems in the Tritonia brain."
https://openalex.org/W1973709046,"Objective The association between pre-antiretroviral (ART) inflammation and immune activation and risk for incident tuberculosis (TB) after ART initiation among adults is uncertain. Design Nested case-control study (n = 332) within ACTG PEARLS trial of three ART regimens among 1571 HIV-infected, treatment-naïve adults in 9 countries. We compared cases (participants with incident TB diagnosed by 96 weeks) to a random sample of controls (participants who did not develop TB, stratified by country and treatment arm). Methods We measured pre-ART C-reactive protein (CRP), EndoCab IgM, ferritin, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), soluble CD14 (sCD14), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and CD4/DR+/38+ and CD8/DR+/38+ T cells. Markers were defined according to established cutoff definitions when available, 75th percentile of measured values when not, and detectable versus undetectable for LPS. Using logistic regression, we measured associations between biomarkers and incident TB, adjusting for age, sex, study site, treatment arm, baseline CD4 and log10 viral load. We assessed the discriminatory value of biomarkers using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results Seventy-seven persons (4.9%) developed incident TB during follow-up. Elevated baseline CRP (aOR 3.25, 95% CI: 1.55–6.81) and IP-10 (aOR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05–3.39), detectable plasma LPS (aOR 2.39, 95% CI: 1.13–5.06), and the established TB risk factors anemia and hypoalbuminemia were independently associated with incident TB. In ROC analysis, CRP, albumin, and LPS improved discrimination only modestly for TB risk when added to baseline routine patient characteristics including CD4 count, body mass index, and prior TB. Conclusion Incident TB occurs commonly after ART initiation. Although associated with higher post-ART TB risk, baseline CRP, IP-10, and LPS add limited value to routine patient characteristics in discriminating who develops active TB. Besides determining ideal cutoffs for these biomarkers, additional biomarkers should be sought that predict TB disease in ART initiators."
https://openalex.org/W2015786903,"The acute form of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT, also known as Sleeping sickness) caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense has been shown to have a wide spectrum of focus specific clinical presentation and severity in East and Southern Africa. Indeed HAT occurs in regions endemic for other tropical diseases, however data on how these co-morbidities might complicate the clinical picture and affect disease outcome remains largely scanty. We here describe the clinical presentation, presence of co-infections, and how the latter impact on HAT prognosis.We carried out a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 258 sleeping sickness patients reporting to Lwala hospital between 2005 and 2012. The mean patient age was 28.6 years with a significant number of cases below 18 years (p< 0.0001). About 93.4% of the cases were diagnosed as late stage (p< 0.0001). The case fatality rate was 10.5% with post treatment reactive encephalopathys reported in 7.9% of the cases, of whom 36.8% eventually died. Fever was significantly (p = 0.045) higher in patients under 18 years. Of the early stage patients, 26.7% and 6.7% presented with late stage signs of sleep disorder and mental confusion respectively. Among the co-infections, malaria was significantly more prevalent (28.9%; p< 0.0001) followed by urinary tract infections (4.2%). Co-infections were present in 14.3% of in-hospital deaths, 38.5% of which were recorded as Malaria. Malaria was significantly more common in patients under 18 years (45.5%; p< 0.02), and was reported in 60% of the fatal cases in this age group.We show a wide spectrum of sleeping sickness clinical presentation and disease outcome that was apparently not significantly influenced by concurrent infections. It would thus be interesting to determine the host and/or parasite factors that might be responsible for the observed diverse clinical presentation."
https://openalex.org/W1967161811,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of human skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) globally. Notably, 80% of all SSTIs are caused by S. aureus, of which ∼63% are abscesses and/or cellulitis. Although progress has been made, our knowledge of the host and pathogen factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of SSTIs is incomplete. To provide a more comprehensive view of this process, we monitored changes in the S. aureus transcriptome and selected host proinflammatory molecules during abscess formation and resolution in a rabbit skin infection model. Within the first 24 h, S. aureus transcripts involved in DNA repair, metabolite transport, and metabolism were up-regulated, suggesting an increase in the machinery encoding molecules involved in replication and cell division. There was also increased expression of genes encoding virulence factors, namely secreted toxins and fibronectin and/or fibrinogen-binding proteins. Of the host genes tested, we found that transcripts encoding IL-8, IL1β, oncostatin M-like, CCR1, CXCR1 (IL8RA), CCL4 (MIP-1β) and CCL3 (MIP1α)-like proteins were among the most highly up-regulated transcripts during S. aureus abscess formation. Our findings provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of S. aureus SSTIs, including a temporal component of the host response. These results serve as a springboard for future studies directed to better understand how/why mild or moderate SSTIs progress to invasive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2009039843,"Reverse genetic techniques harnessing mutational approaches are powerful tools that can provide substantial insight into gene function in plants. However, as compared to diploid species, reverse genetic analyses in polyploid plants such as bread wheat can present substantial challenges associated with high levels of sequence and functional similarity amongst homoeologous loci. We previously developed a high-throughput method to identify deletions of genes within a physically mutagenized wheat population. Here we describe our efforts to combine multiple homoeologous deletions of three candidate disease susceptibility genes (TaWRKY11, TaPFT1 and TaPLDß1). We were able to produce lines featuring homozygous deletions at two of the three homoeoloci for all genes, but this was dependent on the individual mutants used in crossing. Intriguingly, despite extensive efforts, viable lines possessing homozygous deletions at all three homoeoloci could not be produced for any of the candidate genes. To investigate deletion size as a possible reason for this phenomenon, we developed an amplicon sequencing approach based on synteny to Brachypodium distachyon to assess the size of the deletions removing one candidate gene (TaPFT1) in our mutants. These analyses revealed that genomic deletions removing the locus are relatively large, resulting in the loss of multiple additional genes. The implications of this work for the use of heavy ion mutagenesis for reverse genetic analyses in wheat are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031894582,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in thermoregulation in species living in cold environments, given heat can be generated from its chemical energy reserves. Here we investigate the existence of BAT in blubber in four species of delphinoid cetacean, the Pacific white-sided and bottlenose dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens and Tursiops truncates, and Dall’s and harbour porpoises, Phocoenoides dalli and Phocoena phocoena. Histology revealed adipocytes with small unilocular fat droplets and a large eosinophilic cytoplasm intermingled with connective tissue in the innermost layers of blubber. Chemistry revealed a brown adipocyte-specific mitochondrial protein, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), within these same adipocytes, but not those distributed elsewhere throughout the blubber. Western blot analysis of extracts from the inner blubber layer confirmed that the immunohistochemical positive reaction was specific to UCP1 and that this adipose tissue was BAT. To better understand the distribution of BAT throughout the entire cetacean body, cadavers were subjected to computed tomography (CT) scanning. Resulting imagery, coupled with histological corroboration of fine tissue structure, revealed adipocytes intermingled with connective tissue in the lowest layer of blubber were distributed within a thin, highly dense layer that extended the length of the body, with the exception of the rostrum, fin and fluke regions. As such, we describe BAT effectively enveloping the cetacean body. Our results suggest that delphinoid blubber could serve a role additional to those frequently attributed to it: simple insulation blanket, energy storage, hydrodynamic streamlining or contributor to positive buoyancy. We believe delphinoid BAT might also function like an electric blanket, enabling animals to frequent waters cooler than blubber as an insulator alone might otherwise allow an animal to withstand, or allow animals to maintain body temperature in cool waters during sustained periods of physical inactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2083406479,"Promise is one of the most powerful tools producing trust and facilitating cooperation, and sticking to the promise is deemed as a key social norm in social interactions. The present study explored the extent to which promise would influence investors’ decision-making in the trust game where promise had no predictive value regarding trustees’ reciprocation. In addition, we examined the neural underpinnings of the investors’ outcome processing related to the trustees’ promise keeping and promise breaking. Consistent with our hypothesis, behavioral results indicated that promise could effectively increase the investment frequency of investors. Electrophysiological results showed that, promise induced larger differentiated-FRN responses to the reward and non-reward discrepancy. Taken together, these results suggested that promise would promote cooperative behavior, while breach of promise would be regarded as a violation of the social norm, corroborating the vital role of non-enforceable commitment in social decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2140390341,"The degradation of natural forests to modified forests threatens subtropical and tropical biodiversity worldwide. Yet, species responses to forest modification vary considerably. Furthermore, effects of forest modification can differ, whether with respect to diversity components (taxonomic or phylogenetic) or to local (α-diversity) and regional (β-diversity) spatial scales. This real-world complexity has so far hampered our understanding of subtropical and tropical biodiversity patterns in human-modified forest landscapes. In a subtropical South African forest landscape, we studied the responses of three successive plant life stages (adult trees, saplings, seedlings) and of birds to five different types of forest modification distinguished by the degree of within-forest disturbance and forest loss. Responses of the two taxa differed markedly. Thus, the taxonomic α-diversity of birds was negatively correlated with the diversity of all plant life stages and, contrary to plant diversity, increased with forest disturbance. Conversely, forest disturbance reduced the phylogenetic α-diversity of all plant life stages but not that of birds. Forest loss neither affected taxonomic nor phylogenetic diversity of any taxon. On the regional scale, taxonomic but not phylogenetic β-diversity of both taxa was well predicted by variation in forest disturbance and forest loss. In contrast to adult trees, the phylogenetic diversity of saplings and seedlings showed signs of contemporary environmental filtering. In conclusion, forest modification in this subtropical landscape strongly shaped both local and regional biodiversity but with contrasting outcomes. Phylogenetic diversity of plants may be more threatened than that of mobile species such as birds. The reduced phylogenetic diversity of saplings and seedlings suggests losses in biodiversity that are not visible in adult trees, potentially indicating time-lags and contemporary shifts in forest regeneration. The different responses of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity to forest modifications imply that biodiversity conservation in this subtropical landscape requires the preservation of natural and modified forests."
https://openalex.org/W2024814551,"Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic disease with high fatality. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a promising vaccine candidate against EBOV. We recently showed that VLPs protect mice from lethal EBOV infection when given before or after viral infection. To elucidate pathways through which VLPs confer post-exposure protection, we investigated the role of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. We found that VLPs lead to accelerated induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver and spleen of wild type mice, but not in Ifnar-/- mice. Accordingly, EBOV infected Ifnar-/- mice, unlike wild type mice succumbed to death even after VLP treatment. The ISGs induced in wild type mice included anti-viral proteins and negative feedback factors known to restrict viral replication and excessive inflammatory responses. Importantly, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was much higher in WT mice without VLPs than mice treated with VLPs. In EBOV infected Ifnar-/- mice, however, uninhibited viral replication and elevated proinflammatory factor expression ensued, irrespective of VLP treatment, supporting the view that type I IFN signaling helps to limit viral replication and attenuate inflammatory responses. Further analyses showed that VLP protection requires the transcription factor, IRF8 known to amplify type I IFN signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages, the probable sites of initial EBOV infection. Together, this study indicates that VLPs afford post-exposure protection by promoting expeditious initiation of type I IFN signaling in the host."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of traumatic dental injury and its association with overjet, lip protection, sex, socioeconomic status, social capital and binge drinking among 12-year-old students. Research Design and Method A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 633 12-year-old students. Data were collected through a clinical exam and self-administered questionnaires. Socioeconomic status was determined based on mother’s schooling and household income. The Social Capital Questionnaire for Adolescent Students and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) were used to measure social capital and binge drinking, respectively. Results The prevalence of traumatic dental injury was 29.9% (176/588). Traumatic dental injury was more prevalent among male adolescents (p = 0.010), those with overjet greater than 5 mm (p < 0.001) and those with inadequate lip protection (p < 0.001). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, overjet [OR = 3.80 (95% CI: 2.235–6.466), p < 0.0001], inadequate lip protection [OR = 5.585 (95% CI: 3.654–8.535), p < 0.0001] and binge drinking [OR = 1.93 (95% CI: 1.21–3.06), p = 0.005] remained significantly associated with traumatic dental injury. Conclusions The present findings suggest that a high level of total social capital and trust are not associated with TDI in adolescents, unlike binge drinking. The effects of social and behavioral factors on TDI are not well elucidated. Therefore, further research involving other populations and a longitudinal design is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2091689682,"Resprouting multi-stemmed woody plants form an important component of the woody vegetation in many ecosystems, but a clear methodology for reliable measurement of their size and quick, non-destructive estimation of their woody biomass and carbon stock is lacking. Our goal was to find a minimum number of sprouts, i.e., the most easily obtainable, and sprout parameters that should be measured for accurate sprout biomass and carbon stock estimates. Using data for 5 common temperate woody species, we modelled carbon stock and sprout biomass as a function of an increasing number of sprouts in an interaction with different sprout parameters. The mean basal diameter of only two to five of the thickest sprouts and the basal diameter and DBH of the thickest sprouts per stump proved to be accurate estimators for the total sprout biomass of the individual resprouters and the populations of resprouters, respectively. Carbon stock estimates were strongly correlated with biomass estimates, but relative carbon content varied among species. Our study demonstrated that the size of the resprouters can be easily measured, and their biomass and carbon stock estimated; therefore, resprouters can be simply incorporated into studies of woody vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W1972325998,"Natural killer (NK) cells belong to the innate lymphoid cells. Their cytotoxic activity is regulated by the delicate balance between activating and inhibitory signals. NKp46 is a member of the primary activating receptors of NK cells. We previously reported that the NKp46 receptor is involved in the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Subsequently, we hypothesized that blocking this receptor could prevent or hinder disease development. To address this goal, we developed monoclonal antibodies for murine NKp46. One mAb, named NCR1.15, recognizes the mouse homologue protein of NKp46, named Ncr1, and was able to down-regulate the surface expression of NKp46 on primary murine NK cells following antibody injection in vivo. Additionally, NCR1.15 treatments were able to down-regulate cytotoxic activity mediated by NKp46, but not by other NK receptors. To test our primary assumption, we examined T1D development in two models, non-obese diabetic mice and low-dose streptozotocin. Our results show a significantly lower incidence of diabetic mice in the NCR1.15-treated group compared to control groups. This study directly demonstrates the involvement of NKp46 in T1D development and suggests a novel treatment strategy for early insulitis."
https://openalex.org/W2024251756,"In neuroexocytosis, SNAREs and Munc18-1 may consist of the minimal membrane fusion machinery. Consistent with this notion, we observed, using single molecule fluorescence assays, that Munc18-1 stimulates SNARE zippering and SNARE-dependent lipid mixing in the absence of a major Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), providing the structural basis for the conserved function of Sec1/Munc18 proteins in exocytosis. However, when full-length Syt1 is present, no enhancement of SNARE zippering and no acceleration of Ca2+-triggered content mixing by Munc18-1 are observed. Thus, our results show that Syt1 acts as an antagonist for Munc18-1 in SNARE zippering and fusion pore opening. Although the Sec1/Munc18 family may serve as part of the fusion machinery in other exocytotic pathways, Munc18-1 may have evolved to play a different role, such as regulating syntaxin-1a in neuroexocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2040871186,"Human-altered environments often challenge native species with a complex spatial distribution of resources. Hostile landscape features can inhibit animal movement (i.e., genetic exchange), while other landscape attributes facilitate gene flow. The genetic attributes of organisms inhabiting such complex environments can reveal the legacy of their movements through the landscape. Thus, by evaluating landscape attributes within the context of genetic connectivity of organisms within the landscape, we can elucidate how a species has coped with the enhanced complexity of human altered environments. In this research, we utilized genetic data from eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) in conjunction with spatially explicit habitat attribute data to evaluate the realized permeability of various landscape elements in a fragmented agricultural ecosystem. To accomplish this we 1) used logistic regression to evaluate whether land cover attributes were most often associated with the matrix between or habitat within genetically identified populations across the landscape, and 2) utilized spatially explicit habitat attribute data to predict genetically-derived Bayesian probabilities of population membership of individual chipmunks in an agricultural ecosystem. Consistency between the results of the two approaches with regard to facilitators and inhibitors of gene flow in the landscape indicate that this is a promising new way to utilize both landscape and genetic data to gain a deeper understanding of human-altered ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2002009109,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent progress in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment has been achieved due to a better understanding the molecular mechanisms of the disease and the identification of biomarkers that allow more specific cancer treatments. One of the best known examples of personalized therapy is the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, for the successful treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer patients selected based on the specific EGFR mutations. Therefore, the reliable detection of mutations is critical for the application of appropriate therapy. In this study, we tested a two-tiered mutation detection strategy using real-time PCR assays as a well-validated high-sensitivity method and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)-based EGFRmut+ assay as a second-tier standard-sensitivity method. One additional advantage of the applied MLPA method is that it allows the simultaneous detection of EGFR mutations and copy-number alterations (i.e., amplifications) in EGFR, MET and ERBB2. Our analysis showed high concordance between these two methods. With the use of this two-tier strategy, we reliably determined the frequency of EGFR mutations and EGFR, MET and ERBB2 amplifications in over 200 lung cancer samples. Additionally, taking advantage of simultaneous copy number and small mutation analyses, we showed a very strong correlation between EGFR mutations and EGFR amplifications and a mutual exclusiveness of EGFR mutations/amplifications with MET and ERBB2 amplifications. Our results proved the reliability and usefulness of the two-tiered EGFR testing strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2017392313,"The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality may differ by ethnicity, but its exact nature remains unclear among Koreans. The study aim was to prospectively examine the association between BMI and mortality in Korean.6166 residents (2636 men; 3530 women) of rural communities (Kangwha County, Republic of Korea) aged 55 and above were followed up for deaths from 1985-2008. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model.During the 23.8 years of follow-up (an average of 12.5 years in men and 15.7 years in women), 2174 men and 2372 women died. Men with BMI of 21.0-27.4 and women with BMI of 20.0-27.4 had a minimal risk for all-cause mortality. A lower BMI as well as a higher BMI increased the hazard ratio of death. For example, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios associated with BMI below 16, and with BMI of 27.5 and above, were 2.4 (95% CI = 1.6-3.5) and 1.5 (95% CI = 1.1-1.9) respectively, in men, compared to those with BMI of 23.0-24.9. This reverse J-curve association was maintained among never smokers, and among people with no known chronic diseases. Higher BMI increased vascular mortality, while lower BMI increased deaths from vascular diseases, cancers, and, especially, respiratory diseases. Except for cancers, these associations were generally weaker in women than in men.A reverse J-curve association between BMI and all-cause mortality may exist. BMI of 21-27.4 (rather than the range suggested by WHO of 18.5-23 for Asians) may be considered a normal range with acceptable risk in Koreans aged 55 and above, and may be used as cut points for interventions. More concern should be given to people with BMI above and below a BMI range with acceptable risk. Further studies are needed to determine ethnicity-specific associations."
https://openalex.org/W1991796497,"We recently identified the antioxidant protein Sestrin 2 (Sesn2) as a suppressor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (Pdgfrβ) signaling and Pdgfrβ signaling as an inducer of lung regeneration and injury repair. Here, we identified Sesn2 and the antioxidant gene inducer nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as positive regulators of proteasomal function. Inactivation of Sesn2 or Nrf2 induced reactive oxygen species-mediated proteasomal inhibition and Pdgfrβ accumulation. Using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic HeLa and mouse embryonic stem cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged Sesn2 at nearly endogenous levels, we also showed that Sesn2 physically interacts with 2-Cys peroxiredoxins and Nrf2 albeit under different reductive conditions. Overall, we characterized a novel, redox-sensitive Sesn2/Pdgfrβ suppressor pathway that negatively interferes with lung regeneration and is up-regulated in the emphysematous lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."

Using a single vesicle-vesicle content-mixing assay with reconstituted neuronal SNAREs, synaptotagmin-1, and complexin-1, we show that the neuronal SM protein Munc18a/nSec1 has no effect on the intrinsic kinetics of both spontaneous fusion and Ca2+-triggered fusion between vesicles that mimic synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane. However, wild type Munc18a reduced vesicle association ∼50% when the vesicles bearing the t-SNAREs syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 were preincubated with Munc18 for 30 min. Single molecule experiments with labeled SNAP-25 indicate that the reduction of vesicle association is a consequence of sequestration of syntaxin-1A by Munc18a and subsequent release of SNAP-25 (i.e. Munc18a captures syntaxin-1A via its high affinity interaction). Moreover, a phosphorylation mimic mutant of Munc18a with reduced affinity to syntaxin-1A results in less reduction of vesicle association. In summary, Munc18a does not directly affect fusion, although it has an effect on the t-SNARE complex, depending on the presence of other factors and experimental conditions.

Here we focus on the mechanism of action of Munc18a.

There is intensive debate as to whether Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, which are required components of all membrane trafficking pathways, play a role in facilitating or regulating SNARE complex assembly or if they are involved in the fusion process itself (10Carr C.M. Rizo J. At the junction of SNARE and SM protein function.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 488-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rizo J. Südhof T.C. The membrane fusion enigma: SNAREs, Sec1/Munc18 proteins, and their accomplices–guilty as charged?.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 28: 279-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Evidence that the neuronal SM protein Munc18a is involved in more than “just” facilitation or regulation comes primarily from Munc18a knock-out studies in mice (12Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Synaptic assembly of the brain in the absence of neurotransmitter secretion.Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) that resulted in complete loss of neurotransmitter release. However, Munc18a knockout also resulted in a 70% reduction in total syntaxin-1 protein level in brain lysates of the knock-out mice and reduced syntaxin-1 mRNA levels (13Bouwman J. Spijker S. Schut D. Wächtler B. Ylstra B. Smit A.B. Verhage M. Reduced expression of neuropeptide genes in a genome-wide screen of a secretion-deficient mouse.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the residual syntaxin-1 was correctly targeted to the synapse and formed SDS-resistant SNARE complex (14Toonen R. F.G. de Vries K.J. Zalm R. Südhof T.C. Verhage M. Munc18-1 stabilizes syntaxin 1, but is not essential for syntaxin 1 targeting and SNARE complex formation.J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1393-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), so the reduction in syntaxin-1 levels in the Munc18a knock-out mice may not explain the complete loss of neurotransmitter release. Moreover, amperometry of neuroendocrine cell exocytosis along with overexpression of Munc18a and selected mutants showed that Munc18a has an effect on the initial release rate (15Barclay J.W. Munc-18-1 regulates the initial release rate of exocytosis.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1084-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). So far, there is little evidence from reconstitution experiments that Munc18a plays a major role in fusion itself, although stimulatory effects by SM proteins on SNARE-dependent lipid mixing were observed using ensemble fluorescence assays (16Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. Sec1p directly stimulates SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in vitro.J.

Hammarlund M. Jorgensen E.M. Shen J. Syntaxin N-terminal peptide motif is an initiation factor for the assembly of the SNARE-Sec1/Munc18 membrane fusion complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22399-22406Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A stimulatory effect of Munc18a was also observed in conjunction with neuronal SNAREs using a single vesicle-vesicle lipid-mixing assay (19Diao J. Su Z. Lu X. Yoon T.-Y. Shin Y.-K. Ha T. Single-vesicle fusion assay reveals Munc18-1 binding to the SNARE core is sufficient for stimulating membrane fusion.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2010; 1: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, all of these experiments only used neuronal SNAREs in addition to Munc18a. Subsequent ensemble experiments that reconstituted neuronal SNAREs in liposomes along with neuron-specific proteins synaptotagmin-1 and complexin-1 showed only a relatively small increase of spontaneous (i.e. at zero Ca2+ concentration) lipid mixing and content mixing upon Munc18a inclusion when complexin-1 was present (see Fig. 3 (D and F) in Ref. 20Parisotto D. Pfau M. Scheutzow A. Wild K. Mayer M.P. Malsam J. Sinning I. Söllner T.H. An extended helical conformation in domain 3a of Munc18-1 provides a template for SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 9639-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments with a different subset of synaptic proteins showed that Munc18a acts in conjunction with NSF and αSNAP (soluble NSF adaptor protein), locking syntaxin-1A in a closed conformation and setting the stage for ternary trans-neuronal SNARE complex by the action of Munc13 and an approaching vesicle with synaptobrevin-2 (8Ma C. Su L. Seven A.B. Xu Y. Rizo J. Reconstitution of the vital functions of Munc18 and Munc13 in neurotransmitter release.Science. 2013; 339: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this reconstitution experiment, Munc18a played an essential role to facilitate trans-SNARE complex formation in conjunction with NSF, αSNAP, and Munc13. Although an important step toward understanding the mechanism of Munc18, this study did not provide direct evidence that Munc18a stimulates fusion itself, because the amount of ensemble lipid mixing was roughly the same for a minimal system consisting only of neuronal SNAREs, the C2AB fragment of synaptotagmin-1, and 0.5 μm Ca2+ as well as for the more complete system consisting of the same proteins plus NSF, αSNAP, Munc18a, and Munc13 (see Fig. 4D in Ref. 8Ma C. Su L. Seven A.B. Xu Y. Rizo J. Reconstitution of the vital functions of Munc18 and Munc13 in neurotransmitter release.Science. 2013; 339: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the ensemble lipid-mixing method used for this particular comparison may have masked an effect of Munc18a by opposing effects on the association of vesicles prior to fusion and fusion itself because ensemble fluorescence assays generally cannot distinguish between these two effects (21Cypionka A. Stein A. Hernandez J.M. Hippchen H. Jahn R. Walla P.J. Discrimination between docking and fusion of liposomes reconstituted with neuronal SNARE-proteins using FCS.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18575-18580Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The function of SM proteins may be similar or different in other systems. As a case in point, Wickner and co-workers (22Stroupe C. Hickey C.M. Mima J. Burfeind A.S. Wickner W. Minimal membrane docking requirements revealed by reconstitution of Rab GTPase-dependent membrane fusion from purified components.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17626-17633Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that in the yeast vacuolar fusion system, efficient fusion with reconstituted proteins requires the HOPS complex, which contains the SM protein Vps33. HOPS, with its SM subunit, appears to be involved primarily in tethering and in a proofreading mechanism, rather than fusion itself (23Zick M. Stroupe C. Orr A. Douville D. Wickner W.T.

SM proteins Sly1 and Vps33 co-assemble with Sec17 and SNARE complexes to oppose SNARE disassembly by Sec18.Elife. 2014; 3: e02272Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), because its function can be replaced by synthetically induced tethering of vacuolar vesicles (26Zick M. Wickner W. The tethering complex HOPS catalyzes assembly of the soluble SNARE Vam7 into fusogenic trans-SNARE complexes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 3746-3753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the HOPS tethering complex causes a much more significant increase in the rate of fusion that cannot be explained by a simple increase in the number of trans-SNARE complexes (27Zick M. Wickner W.T. A distinct tethering step is vital for vacuole membrane fusion.Elife. 2014; 3: e03251Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that it makes SNARE complexes more fusion-competent prior to fusion (e.g. by preventing transient antiparallel SNARE associations (28Weninger K. Bowen M.E. Chu S. Brunger A.T. Single-molecule studies of SNARE complex assembly reveal parallel and antiparallel configurations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14800-14805Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Munc18a interacts with neuronal SNARE proteins throughout the synaptic vesicle cycle in complexes involving syntaxin-1A and the ternary SNARE complex (syntaxin-1A·SNAP-25·synaptobrevin-2) (29Misura K.M.

Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. Munc18a controls SNARE assembly through its interaction with the syntaxin N-peptide.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Moreover, Munc18a co-localizes with syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 in fixed cultured neurons and forms nanoclusters in the plasma membrane (32Pertsinidis A. Mukherjee K. Sharma M. Pang Z.P. Park S.R. Zhang Y. Brunger A.T. Südhof T.C. Chu S. Ultrahigh-resolution imaging reveals formation of neuronal SNARE/Munc18 complexes in situ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E2812-E2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); knockdown of both syntaxin isoforms, syntaxin-1A and syntaxin-1B, disrupts the co-localization of Munc18a to SNAP-25. Munc18a tightly binds to syntaxin-1A in a “closed” conformation in which its Habc domain associates in cis with its SNARE domain (29Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I.

NMR analysis of the closed conformation of syntaxin-1.J. Biomol. NMR. 2008; 41: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which in turn hinders the SNARE complex assembly (31Burkhardt P.

Specificity and regulation of a synaptic vesicle docking complex.Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in neuroendocrine cells, transfection of syntaxin alone results in its mislocalization, whereas co-transfection of both Munc18a and syntaxin results in trafficking to the plasma membrane (37Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. Blockade of membrane transport and disassembly of the Golgi complex by expression of syntaxin 1A in neurosecretion-incompetent cells: prevention by rbSEC1.J.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, one function of Munc18a may be to stabilize or “chaperone” syntaxin, which also agrees with the aforementioned knock-out studies of Munc18a in mice that showed a reduced level of syntaxin-1 in the plasma membrane (13Bouwman J. Spijker S. Schut D. Wächtler B. Ylstra B. Smit A.B. Verhage M. Reduced expression of neuropeptide genes in a genome-wide screen of a secretion-deficient mouse.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Binding of Munc18a to the closed conformation of syntaxin-1A is not always required because rescue experiments in cultured syntaxin-1A-deficient neurons showed that the syntaxin-1A Habc domain is not required for evoked synaptic vesicle fusion, although it was required for spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion (39Zhou P. Pang Z.P. Yang X. Zhang Y. Rosenmund C. Bacaj T. Südhof T.C. Syntaxin-1 N-peptide and Habc-domain perform distinct essential functions in synaptic vesicle fusion.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal residues of syntaxin-1A are required for binding of the ternary SNARE complex to Munc18a and may thereby serve as a recruiting factor for Munc18a (18Rathore S.S. Bend E.G. Yu H. Hammarlund M. Jorgensen E.M. Shen J. Syntaxin N-terminal peptide motif is an initiation factor for the assembly of the SNARE-Sec1/Munc18 membrane fusion complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22399-22406Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because the Habc domain is needed for the closed conformation of syntaxin-1A and the tight interaction with Munc18a, this study suggests that the N-terminal and Habc domains mediate different functions in synaptic vesicle fusion. In this paper, we start from the observation that a minimal system consisting of neuronal SNAREs and the soluble C2AB fragment of synaptotagmin-1 exhibited the same amount of lipid mixing as a more complete reconstitution that also included Munc18a, NSF, αSNAP, and Munc13 (8Ma C. Su L. Seven A.B. Xu Y. Rizo J. Reconstitution of the vital functions of Munc18 and Munc13 in neurotransmitter release.Science. 2013; 339: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). At variance with that work, here we used full-length synaptotagmin-1 and included complexin-1, in a single vesicle-vesicle content-mixing assay. We recently used this assay to decipher the functions of complexin-1 (40Lai Y. Diao J. Cipriano D.J. Zhang Y. Pfuetzner R.A. Padolina M.S. Brunger A.T. Complexin inhibits spontaneous release and synchronizes Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion by distinct mechanisms.Elife. 2014; 3: e03756Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and found that it qualitatively reproduces effects observed in neuronal cultures for both spontaneous and Ca2+-triggered release for a variety of complexin-1 truncations and mutations, lending credence to this approach to investigate mechanistic questions. In the context of studying the potential effect of Munc18a in vesicle fusion, our single vesicle content-mixing assay enables us to distinguish between fusion and vesicle association (often called “docking,” but we prefer not to use this term because it has a different meaning during the life cycle of a synaptic vesicle (1Südhof T.C. Neurotransmitter release: the last millisecond in the life of a synaptic vesicle.Neuron. 2013; 80: 675-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar)). We investigated the effects of Munc18a on fusion and vesicle association between synaptic vesicle-mimicking vesicles (with reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1, referred to as SV vesicles) and plasma membrane-mimicking vesicles (with reconstituted syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25, referred to as PM vesicles) in the presence of complexin-1. We then used a single molecule assay to demonstrate that Munc18a is capable of sequestering syntaxin-1A from preformed t-SNARE complex. We also tested a double mutant that mimics phosphorylation of Munc18a(S306E/S313E) (41Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y.

To understand the molecular basis of the effect of Munc18a on vesicle association and fusion, we used purified proteins to demonstrate that Munc18a can interact specifically with the neuronal binary (syntaxin-1A·SNAP-25) SNARE complex (also referred to as t-SNARE complex) as well as the syntaxin-1A·SNAP-25·synaptobrevin-2 (ternary) SNARE complex. Full-length rat synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) was expressed in Escherichia coli from plasmid pJ414 (DNA 2.0, Menlo Park, CA) with a C-terminal decahistidine tag proceeded by a PreScission protease cleavage site to remove the tag and all cysteine residues changed to alanine except for the cysteine residue at position 277. Syt1 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by growing the cells to A600 of 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C and then induced at 20 °C for 12–16 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells from 6 liters of induced culture were harvested and suspended in 200 ml of synaptotagmin buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 600 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (w/v)) supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to 1 mm and two EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by three passes through the Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) at 15,000 p.s.i. Cell debris and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min in the same rotor. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 1 h. Membranes were washed by homogenization in 100 ml of synaptogamin buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 600 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol (w/v)) supplemented with two EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Membranes were harvested again by centrifugation in a Ti-45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 40,000 rpm for 1 h. The pellet was suspended in 100 ml of synaptotagmin buffer B supplemented with 2 EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets and snap frozen in two 50-ml aliquots in liquid nitrogen. One aliquot of membranes was solubilized in the presence of 1.5% dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) for 1 h at 4 °C. The extract was clarified by centrifugation in a Ti 45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 40,000 rpm for 35 min. The supernatant was bound to a 4-ml bed volume of Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated in synaptotagmin buffer A containing 1.5% dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace) by stirring at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were harvested by centrifugation and poured into a column, attached to an AKTA Prime FPLC system (GE Healthcare), and washed with 50 ml of synaptotagmin buffer A supplemented with 110 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) (Anatrace) and 10 mm imidazole and then eluted with synaptotagmin buffer A supplemented with 110 mm OG and 500 mm imidazole. Protein-containing fractions were combined and injected on a Superdex 200 (16/60) column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 110 mm OG, 10% glycerol (w/v) (synaptotagmin buffer B). Peak fractions were then combined, and 100 μg of prescission protease (GE Healthcare) was added to cleave the tag. Prescission protease-cleaved Syt1 was diluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 110 mm OG, 20 μm EGTA, 10% glycerol (w/v) (synaptotagmin buffer C) to bring the NaCl to 100 mm and then injected on a MonoS 5/50 column (GE Healthcare), washed with synaptotagmin buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl, and eluted with synaptotagmin buffer C containing 600 mm NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were dialyzed against synaptotagmin buffer C to lower the salt concentration and used for reconstitution into proteoliposomes. Full-length wild type complexin-1 (Cpx) was expressed in E. coli using BL21 (DE3) cells with a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag from plasmid pET28a (Novagen). Cells were grown in Luria Broth to an A600 between 0.6 and 0.8, and protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to 0.5 mm for 12–16 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm imidazole (complexin buffer A) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by passing them through the Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer (Avestin) at 15,000 p.s.i. three times. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a Ti-45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 35 min at 40,000 rpm. Supernatant was bound to a 4-ml bed volume of Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) in batch, stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were harvested by centrifugation and poured into a column, attached to an AKTA Prime system (GE Healthcare), and washed with 60 ml of complexin buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole and then eluted with complexin buffer A containing 450 mm imidazole. Protein-containing fractions were combined, and 100 units of thrombin were added. This was then dialyzed against 500 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm DTT (complexin buffer B) overnight at 4 °C. PMSF was added to 1 mm to quench the thrombin activity, and the mixture was injected onto a MonoQ column 5/50 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with complexin buffer B. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of complexin buffer B, and the protein eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in complexin buffer B from 50 to 500 mm NaCl over 30 column volumes. The protein-containing fractions were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm DTT overnight at 4 °C. The protein concentration was measured by absorbance at 280 nm, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Wild type Munc18-1a (referred to here as Munc18a) and Munc18a (S306E/S313E) were expressed in E. coli with an N-terminal, TEV protease-cleavable hexahistidine tag from plasmid pPROExHTa. Proteins were expressed by the addition of IPTG to late log phase cultures (A600 ∼0.6–0.8) to 0.5 mm at 20 °C for 16–18 h. Cell pellets from 6 liters of culture were resuspended in 200 ml of Munc18a lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), supplemented with 4 EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm PMSF and lysed by passing them three times through an Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer (Avestin) at 15"
https://openalex.org/W2021514192,"Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is associated with severe gastrointestinal disease. Upon entering the gastrointestinal tract, EHEC is exposed to a fluctuating environment and a myriad of other bacterial species. To establish an infection, EHEC strains have to modulate their gene expression according to the GI tract environment. In order to explore the interspecies interactions between EHEC and an human intestinal commensal, the global gene expression profile was determined of EHEC O103:H25 (EHEC NIPH-11060424) co-cultured with B. thetaiotaomicron (CCUG 10774) or grown in the presence of spent medium from B. thetaiotaomicron. Microarray analysis revealed that approximately 1% of the EHEC NIPH-11060424 genes were significantly up-regulated both in co-culture (30 genes) and in the presence of spent medium (44 genes), and that the affected genes differed between the two conditions. In co-culture, genes encoding structural components of the type three secretion system were among the most affected genes with an almost 4-fold up-regulation, while the most affected genes in spent medium were involved in chemotaxis and were more than 3-fold up-regulated. The operons for type three secretion system (TTSS) are located on the Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, and qPCR showed that genes of all five operons (LEE1-LEE5) were up-regulated. Moreover, an increased adherence to HeLa cells was observed in EHEC NIPH-11060424 exposed to B. thetaiotaomicron. Expression of stx2 genes, encoding the main virulence factor of EHEC, was down-regulated in both conditions (co-culture/spent medium). These results show that expression of EHEC genes involved in colonization and virulence is modulated in response to direct interspecies contact between cells, or to diffusible factors released from B. thetaiotaomicron. Such interspecies interactions could allow the pathogen to recognize its predilection site and modulate its behaviour accordingly, thus increasing the efficiency of colonization of the colon mucosa, facilitating its persistence and increasing its virulence potential."
https://openalex.org/W2085676437,"The present study investigated the effects of the ethanolic extract (ESa), fractions, and compounds isolated from Sinningia aggregata in male Swiss mice on carrageenan-induced paw edema, neutrophil migration, mechanical hyperalgesia, formalin-induced nociception, and lipopolysaccharide-induced fever. The ESa did not alter edema, neutrophil migration, or fever at any of the doses tested. However, the ESa reduced phase II of formalin-induced nociception and carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. The petroleum ether (PE) and ethyl acetate (EA) fractions and aggregatin D (AgD; isolated from the EA fraction) reduced formalin-induced nociception. Anthraquinones from the PE fraction were ineffective. AgD also inhibited carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Neither the ESa nor AgD altered thermal nociception or motor performance. Local administration of AgD also reduced hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan, bradykinin, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, prostaglandin E2, and dopamine but not hyperalgesia induced by forskolin or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The positive control dipyrone reduced the response induced by all of the stimuli. Additionally, glibenclamide abolished the analgesic effect of dipyrone but not the one induced by AgD. AgD did not change lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production by macrophages or the nociception induced by capsaicin, cinnamaldehyde, acidified saline, or menthol. These results suggest that the ESa has important antinociceptive activity, and this activity results at least partially from the presence of AgD. AgD reduced mechanical hyperalgesia induced by several inflammatory mediators through mechanisms that are different from classic analgesic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2017274998,"A lexicostatistical classification is proposed for 20 languages and dialects of the Lezgian group of the North Caucasian family, based on meticulously compiled 110-item wordlists, published as part of the Global Lexicostatistical Database project. The lexical data have been subsequently analyzed with the aid of the principal phylogenetic methods, both distance-based and character-based: Starling neighbor joining (StarlingNJ), Neighbor joining (NJ), Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Unweighted maximum parsimony (UMP). Cognation indexes within the input matrix were marked by two different algorithms: traditional etymological approach and phonetic similarity, i.e., the automatic method of consonant classes (Levenshtein distances). Due to certain reasons (first of all, high lexicographic quality of the wordlists and a consensus about the Lezgian phylogeny among Caucasologists), the Lezgian database is a perfect testing area for appraisal of phylogenetic methods. For the etymology-based input matrix, all the phylogenetic methods, with the possible exception of UMP, have yielded trees that are sufficiently compatible with each other to generate a consensus phylogenetic tree of the Lezgian lects. The obtained consensus tree agrees with the traditional expert classification as well as some of the previously proposed formal classifications of this linguistic group. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the UMP method has suggested the least plausible tree of all. In the case of the phonetic similarity-based input matrix, the distance-based methods (StarlingNJ, NJ, UPGMA) have produced the trees that are rather close to the consensus etymology-based tree and the traditional expert classification, whereas the character-based methods (Bayesian MCMC, UMP) have yielded less likely topologies."
https://openalex.org/W2316818383,"Repeated stimulus causes a specific suppression of neuronal responses, which is so-called as Stimulus-Specific Adaptation (SSA). This effect can be recovered when the stimulus changes. In the auditory system SSA is a well-known phenomenon that appears at different levels of the mammalian auditory pathway. In this study, we explored the effects of adaptation to a particular stimulus on the auditory tuning curves of anesthetized rats. We used two sequences and compared the responses of each tone combination in these two conditions. First sequence consists of different pure tone combinations that were presented randomly. In the second one, the same stimuli of the first sequence were presented in the context of an adapted stimulus (adapter) that occupied 80% of sequence probability. The population results demonstrated that the adaptation factor decreased the frequency response area and made a change in the tuning curve to shift it unevenly toward the higher thresholds of tones. The local field potentials and multi-unit activity responses have indicated that the neural activities strength of the adapted frequency has been suppressed as well as with lower suppression in neighboring frequencies. This aforementioned reduction changed the characteristic frequency of the tuning curve."
https://openalex.org/W1980910594,"Porcine β defensin 2 (pBD2) is a small, cationic and amphiphilic antimicrobial peptide. It has broad antimicrobial activities against bacteria and plays an important role in host defense. In order to enhance its antimicrobial activity and better understand the effect of positively charged residues on its activity, we substituted eight amino acid residues with arginine or lysine respectively. All mutants were cloned and expressed in BL21 (DE3) plysS and the mutant proteins were then purified. These mutant versions had higher positive charges but similar structural configurations compared to the wild-type pBD2. Moreover, these mutant proteins showed different antimicrobial activities against E. coli and S. aureus. The mutant I4R of pBD2 had the highest antimicrobial activity. In addition, all the mutants showed low hemolytic activities. Our results indicated that the positively charged residues were not the only factor that influenced antimicrobial activity, but other factors such as distribution of these residues on the surface of defensins might also contribute to their antimicrobial potency."
https://openalex.org/W2116727480,"Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is a key enzyme in the triacylglyceride synthesis pathway. Bovine DGAT1 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound protein associated with the regulation of fat content in milk and meat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of DGAT1 peptides corresponding to putative substrate binding sites with different types of model membranes. Whilst these peptides are predicted to be located in an extramembranous loop of the membrane-bound protein, their hydrophobic substrates are membrane-bound molecules. In this study, peptides corresponding to the binding sites of the two substrates involved in the reaction were examined in the presence of model membranes in order to probe potential interactions between them that might influence the subsequent binding of the substrates. Whilst the conformation of one of the peptides changed upon binding several types of micelles regardless of their surface charge, suggesting binding to hydrophobic domains, the other peptide bound strongly to negatively-charged model membranes. This binding was accompanied by a change in conformation, and produced leakage of the liposome-entrapped dye calcein. The different hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions observed suggest the peptides may be involved in the interactions of the enzyme with membrane surfaces, facilitating access of the catalytic histidine to the triacylglycerol substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1995299591,"Background Untreated smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients are the primary source of infection; however, a large number of TB cases have not been identified and are untreated in many sub-Saharan African countries, including Ethiopia. This study determined whether or not a community-based follow-up of chronic coughers improves detection of TB cases and the risk factors for death among such cases. Methods We conducted a census in six rural communities in Sidama, southern Ethiopia. Based on interview and sputum investigation, we identified 724 TB smear-negative chronic coughers, and did a cohort study of these chronic coughers and 1448 neighbourhood controls. For both chronic coughers and neighbourhood controls, we conducted a TB screening interview and performed sputum microscopy, as required, at 4, 7 and 10 months. Between September 2011 and June 2012, we followed chronic coughers and neighbourhood controls for 588 and 1,204 person-years of observation, respectively. Results Of the chronic coughers, 23 developed smear-positive TB (incidence rate = 3912/105 person-years) compared to three neighbourhood controls who developed smear-positive TB (incidence rate = 249/105 person-years). The male-to-female ratio of smear-positive TB was 1:1. We demonstrated that chronic coughers (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR], 13.5; 95% CI, 4.0–45.7) and the poor (aHR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1–5.8) were at high-risk for smear-positive TB. Among the study cohort, 15 chronic coughers and two neighbourhood controls died (aHR, 14.0; 95% CI, 3.2–62.4). Conclusion A community-based follow-up of chronic coughers is helpful in improving smear-positive TB case detection, it benefits socioeconomically disadvantaged people in particular; in rural settings, chronic coughers had a higher risk of death."
https://openalex.org/W2061882344,"Fabry disease is an X-linked inborn error of glycolipid metabolism caused by deficiency of the human lysosomal enzyme, α-galactosidase A (αGal), leading to strokes, myocardial infarctions, and terminal renal failure, often leading to death in the fourth or fifth decade of life. The enzyme is responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal α-galactoside linkages in various glycolipids. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been approved for the treatment of Fabry disease, but adverse reactions, including immune reactions, make it desirable to generate improved methods for ERT. One approach to circumvent these adverse reactions is the development of derivatives of the enzyme with more activity per mg. It was previously reported that carboxyl-terminal deletions of 2 to 10 amino acids led to increased activity of about 2 to 6-fold. However, this data was qualitative or semi-quantitative and relied on comparison of the amounts of mRNA present in Northern blots with αGal enzyme activity using a transient expression system in COS-1 cells. Here we follow up on this report by constructing and purifying mutant enzymes with deletions of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 C-terminal amino acids (Δ2, Δ4, Δ6, Δ8, Δ10) for unambiguous quantitative enzyme assays. The results reported here show that the kcat/Km approximately doubles with deletions of 2, 4, 6 and 10 amino acids (0.8 to 1.7-fold effect) while a deletion of 8 amino acids decreases the kcat/Km (7.2-fold effect). These results indicate that the mutated enzymes with increased activity constructed here would be expected to have a greater therapeutic effect on a per mg basis, and could therefore reduce the likelihood of adverse infusion related reactions in Fabry patients receiving ERT treatment. These results also illustrate the principle that in vitro mutagenesis can be used to generate αGal derivatives with improved enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2091007893,"Maintaining the integrity of the genome requires the high fidelity duplication of the genome and the ability of the cell to recognize and repair DNA lesions. The heterotrimeric single stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding complex Replication Protein A (RPA) is central to multiple DNA processes, which are coordinated by RPA through its ssDNA binding function and through multiple protein-protein interactions. Many RPA interacting proteins have been reported through large genetic and physical screens; however, the number of interactions that have been further characterized is limited. To gain a better understanding of how RPA functions in DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle regulation and to identify other potential functions of RPA, a yeast two hybrid screen was performed using the yeast 70 kDa subunit, Replication Factor A1 (Rfa1), as a bait protein. Analysis of 136 interaction candidates resulted in the identification of 37 potential interacting partners, including the cell cycle regulatory protein and DNA damage clamp loader Rad24. The Rfa1-Rad24 interaction is not dependent on ssDNA binding. However, this interaction appears affected by DNA damage. The regions of both Rfa1 and Rad24 important for this interaction were identified, and the region of Rad24 identified is distinct from the region reported to be important for its interaction with Rfc2 5. This suggests that Rad24-Rfc2-5 (Rad24-RFC) recruitment to DNA damage substrates by RPA occurs, at least partially, through an interaction between the N terminus of Rfa1 and the C terminus of Rad24. The predicted structure and location of the Rad24 C-terminus is consistent with a model in which RPA interacts with a damage substrate, loads Rad24-RFC at the 5’ junction, and then releases the Rad24-RFC complex to allow for proper loading and function of the DNA damage clamp."
