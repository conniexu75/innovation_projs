https://openalex.org/W1987677291,"The Hawthorne effect in experimental research is the unwanted effect of the experimental operations themselves. Following the Hawthorne studies, various explanations have been proposed to account for rising rates of production. Although in the Relay Assembly Test Room experiment the experimental operations may have produced other extraneous variables, a reexamination based on new and neglected evidence has yielded a new interpretation. The new variable, made more plausible because research in other contexts has shown it to have similar effects, is a combination of information feedback and financial reward. It is an example of the control of behavior by its consequences. Although several approaches may be taken to explain the effects of response-consequence contingencies, I have favored operant conditioning because it seems to account for progressive increases in response rate-the Hawthorne phenomenon. Generalizing from the particular situation at Hawthorne, I would define the Hawthorne effect as the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do. But the Hawthorne effect need not be viewed solely as a problem in conducting experiments. The phenomenon that created it should be studied in its own right, as Sommer (67) suggested with a different phenomenon in mind. The study of response-consequence contingencies might well be extended to the examination of motivation in industrial workers."

Organization can be achieved in two ways: In the first, dielectric matter is transported in direct response to the externally applied standing wave optical fields. In the second, the external optical fields induce interactions between dielectric objects that can also result in the creation of complex structures. In either case, these new ordered structures, whose existence depends on the presence of both light and polarizable matter, are referred to as optical matter."
https://openalex.org/W2068120723,"Extensive dating of the fossil corals associated with the Waimanalo shoreline on Oahu has shown that 120,000 years ago the ocean was approximately 7.6 meters above its present level. Corals grown during that time constitute a major portion of the subaerial reef-derived material on the island, with exposures ranging from about 10 meters to near sea level. This evidence corroborates the notion that 120,000 years before the present was the last time during which the sea stood significantly higher than it does today. The reported benches at 3.7, 1.5, and 0.6 meters, if not of Recent origin, could be features created by brief halts of the sea during rapid regression shortly after the Waimanalo high stand."
https://openalex.org/W2058659215,"Explanations for the causes of climatic changes and associated faunal and floral extinctions at the close of the Eocene Epoch have long been controversial because of, in part, uncertainties in correlation and dating of global events. New single-crystal laser fusion (SCLF) (40)Ar/(39)Ar dates on tephra from key magnetostratigraphic and fossilbearing sections necessitate significant revision in North American late Paleogene chronology. The Chadronian-Orellan North American Land Mammal ""Age"" boundary, as a result, is shifted from 32.4 to 34.0 Ma (million years ago), the Orellan-Whitneyan boundary is shifted from 30.8 to 32.0 Ma, and the Whitneyan-Arikareean boundary is now approximately 29.0 Ma. The new dates shift the correlation of Chron C12R from the Chadronian to within the Orellan-Whitneyan interval, the Chadronian becomes late Eocene in age, and the North American Oligocene is restricted to the Orellan, Whitneyan, and early Arikareean. The Eocene-Oligocene boundary, and its associated climate change and extinction events, as a result, correlates with the Chadronian-Orellan boundary, not the Duchesnean-Chadronian boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2044424054,"The takeover wave of the 1980s moved large enterprises toward specialization and away from the diversification of the 1960s. The easy availability of funds made acquisitions affordable, while the hands-off antitrust policy allowed mergers between two firms in the same industry. Hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts fostered the break up of conglomerates and the sell-off of divisions to buyers in the same industry; they helped speed the economy-wide move toward specialization. The poor performance of conglomerates indicates that this trend toward specialization is likely to make U.S. industry more competitive. Current state antitakeover laws are probably the result of intense lobbying by managers trying to entrench themselves; these laws do not promote competitiveness of U.S. industry. In contrast, the current accommodating federal antitrust stance encourages specialization."
https://openalex.org/W2013036835,The crew members on the last seven Apollo flights observed light flashes that are tentatively attributed to cosmic ray nuclei (atomic number â‰¥ 6) penetrating the head and eyes of the observers. Analyses of the event rates for all missions has revealed an anomalously low rate for transearth coast observations with respect to translunar coast observations.
https://openalex.org/W2054283592,"We have argued that aerosols are probably the principal agents by which pollutants may affect weather and climate. They are most likely to act by influencing the structure and distribution of clouds. On the local scale, the effects of pollutants on some aspects of weather are unmistakable. The effects of man-made pollutants on global climate are a matter of debate, but they may already be significant."

They provide an effective way of monitoring auroral activity on a worldwide basis and are likely to become one of the major tools in the effort to understand this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2048647452,A Nb(3)Sn superconductor has been fabricated in rods and tapes by the interaction of the tin contained in a copper-tin alloy with niobium which had been in contact with the alloy material. This conductor has lower alternating-current (60 hertz) losses than any presently available commercial products.
https://openalex.org/W1970566284,"The proportions of major oxides in the Allende carbonaceous chondrite after partial reduction are remarkably similar to those in possible mantle material of the earth. When heated, the Allende meteorite generates a sulfide melt (47 percent iron, 25 percent nickel, and 24 percent sulfur by weight), a ferrobasaltic melt, and olivine with or without pyroxene, over a wide pressure range (5 to 25 kilobars). The silicate melt contains more sodium and less titanium than lunar ferrobasalts. An aggregate of the Allende chondrite rich in calcium and aluminum produces silica-undersaturated, calcium-rich melt and spinel over a wide pressure and temperature range. From these studies, it is suggested that the earth's core contains significant amounts of both nickel and sulfur and that a 3 : 2 mixture of Allende bulk sample and calcium- and aluminum-rich aggregates is closer in major element abundances than either of these components to the average composition of the moon."

In test plots, population densities were as high as 32 pairs of pupae in an area of about 700 square meters."

https://openalex.org/W2035505824,"Observations of the growing margin of Pecten diegensis show that calcification can occur on an unstable substrate, although this initial shell material is quite disordered. Later growth on the inner surface of the disordered material soon becomes ordered, which suggests that the calcification process benefits from the stability of a mineralized substrate, but does not utilize the substrate as a physical or stereochemical template."
