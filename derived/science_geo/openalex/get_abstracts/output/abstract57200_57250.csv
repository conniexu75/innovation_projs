https://openalex.org/W2038723385,"After unilateral removal of the optic tectum in frogs, the cut optic tract regenerates to the remaining ipsilateral tectum. Although the orienting movementselicited by moving objects (food or threats) are now directed mirror-symmetrically to normal responses, these frogs correctly localize stationary objects as barriers. Apparently, thalamic and tectal visual mechanisms can operate independently."

The antigen designated Ir-1.1 seems to be present only on a subpopulation of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and spleen. It is absent on bone marrow cells.
https://openalex.org/W2057680670,The column of a standard gas chromatograph was replaced with in vivo frog olfactory sac. The wide range of relative retention times as measured across the olfactory mucosa for 15 different odorants supports the concept of a chromatographic separation along the mucosa as a mechanism for distinguishing different odorants.
https://openalex.org/W1609280109,"Abstract The effects of Ca2+, Mg2+, pH, temperature, and nucleotides (ATP or GTP) on the oxytocin-sensitive adenylate cyclase of frog bladder epithelial cells were studied. The site of the action of these parameters on the binding step, receptor-cyclase coupling, and the adenylate cyclase system as a whole was deduced from a comparison of their effects on basal, and oxytocin- and fluoride-sensitive activities and on the apparent Km of the system for oxytocin. Minute amounts of Ca2+ were found necessary for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by oxytocin. Elimination of Ca2+ by treatment with ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid led to inhibition of the response, which was completely restored by the addition of 10-6 m free Ca2+. Calcium concentrations higher than 5 x 10-5 m were inhibitory, with no change in the apparent Km for oxytocin. Basal activity remained unchanged throughout the range of Ca2+ concentrations tested. The measurement of oxytocin-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity as a function of the ATP concentration in the medium showed that the hormone increases both the maximum velocity of the adenylate cyclase and its affinity for ATP. When low ATP concentrations were used (between 10-6 and 2.5 x 10-4 m), the activation ratio (stimulated to basal activities) showed an optimum for 10-5 m ATP. When low GTP concentrations (10-8 to 10-6 m) were used, the magnitude of this optimum increased and moved toward the lowest concentrations. These results were taken as evidence for the existence of regulatory sites binding either GTP or ATP; the occupancy of these sites enhances the velocity of the adenylate cyclase reaction to a greater extent in the presence of oxytocin than under basal conditions. Oxytocin increases the affinity of the regulatory site for ATP or GTP. Lowering the pH of the incubation medium from 8.0 to 7.0 resulted in a loss of affinity for oxytocin, with no change either in maximum stimulation or fluoride-sensitive activity, suggesting an effect of pH primarily located at the hormone-binding step. Thermal denaturation at 43° for ½ to 30 min did not make it possible to dissociate the hormonal and fluoride stimulation processes. Magnesium experiments confirmed the existence of two actions of Mg2+ ions acting as cosubstrate with ATP and as a regulatory agent for the cyclase system. Effects of varying Mg2+ concentration on fluoride-sensitive activity must be interpreted with caution because of possible formation of poorly dissociated complexes between (F-, Mg2+, and HPO42-)."
https://openalex.org/W2012677463,"Release of melanophore stimulating hormone (MSH) from the vertebrate pars intermedia is under inhibitory control by the hypothalamus. Removal of the rat pituitary or the neurointermediate lobe of the frog (Rana pipiens) to in vitro incubation medium results in rapid uninhibited release of MSH. This secretion is inhibited by norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine, and the inhibition is antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. Isoproterenol stimulation of MSH secretion from isolated glands is blocked by pro-pranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. These results implicate dopaminergic or classical alpha-adrenergic receptors (or both) in inhibition of MSH release by catecholamines, and implicate beta-adrenergic receptors in stimulation of MSH release by the bioamines."
https://openalex.org/W2008834505,"The accumulation of cerebral 5-hydroxytryptophan after decarboxylase inhibition was decreased in rats maintained at arterial O(2) tensions below 60 mm-Hg. In contrast, brain lactate was stable above 40 mm-Hg and brain adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate were unchanged above 30 mm-Hg. There was a linear correlation of brain 5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation to cerebral venous O(2) tension. Cerebral tryptophan hydroxylase appears to have a poor affinity for oxygen and to be affected by slight hypoxia. The resultant decreases in monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism may explain the behavioral changes of mild oxygen deprivation."

https://openalex.org/W2015316024,"Intracellular molar Na(+) activity (a(Na)), measured with cation-selective glass microelectrodes, in epithelial cells of isolated bullfrog small intestine immersed at 26 degrees C in a sodium sulfate Ringer solution containing mannitol was 0.0144 +/- 0.0031 (average value plus or minus standard deviation). The corresponding K(+) activity (a(K)) was 0.0854 +/- 0.0060. Combination of these values with previous estimates of intracellular Na(+) and K(+) concentrations under identical conditions indicated that a substantial fraction of the cellular Na(+) is in an osmotically inactive state. When the cells were exposed to a Ringer solution in which 26 millimoles of mannitol per liter were replaced by 3-O-methyl glucose, highly significant decreases in a(K) and a(Na) were observed. The decrease in a(K) was proportionately larger than the corresponding decrease in a(Na)."
https://openalex.org/W1548800967,"Abstract The relative rates of phosphorylation, deamination, and cleavage of deoxyadenosine and adenosine were examined in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells; mouse, human, and sheep erythrocytes; and mouse brain, heart, kidney, and liver. Cleavage of deoxyadenosine was measured by the formation of adenine ribonucleotides and phosphorylation by the formation of adenine deoxyribonucleotides; deamination of deoxyadenosine was inhibited by coformycin. All of the tissues examined exhibited a low but measurable ability to cleave the glycosidic bond of deoxyadenosine. The deoxyadenosine kinase to cleavage ratio was greatest, 3.5 to 6, in erythrocytes, 2.1 for Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, and near unity for mouse tissues. In the absence of the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, deamination was the major route of deoxyadenosine metabolism in mouse brain, heart, kidney, and liver and in mouse and human erythrocytes, whereas phosphorylation and deamination were nearly equivalent in sheep erythrocytes. At low substrate concentrations (less than 150 µm) more adenosine was phosphorylated than deaminated in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579553111,"Abstract Uroporphyrinogen I synthetase (porphobilinogen deaminase) from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides was purified 700-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation, column chromatography, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme appeared as a single sharp protein band on analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein band corresponded to the enzymic activity. Electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and β-mercaptoethanol also revealed a single sharp band. The mobility of this band corresponded to a molecular weight of about 36,000 when compared with proteins of known molecular weight. Molecular weight determinations by means of gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and sucrose density gradient centrifugation gave values of 35,500 and 39,000, respectively. These data suggest that uroporphyrinogen I synthetase exists as a single polypeptide chain. No evidence for species larger than a molecular weight of 36,000 was found at any point during the studies. The purified enzyme is quite labile and may be somewhat stabilized by 25% glycerol and storage between pH 8 and 9. The enzyme is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated below pH 6. The purified enzyme is very sensitive to low ionic strengths or freezing. The pH optimum is 7.6 in both phosphate and Tris buffers. The enzyme is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, and iodine."

Humoral antibody was directed primarily against denatured DNA, although antibody to native DNA was also found. Persistent infection with lactate dehydrogenase virus significantly lowered antibodies both to nuclear antigen and to DNA in these mice.

Mice that received the tetranucleoside isogeneic IgG from birth to 5 months of age failed to make antibody to denatured DNA. In contrast, mice that were similarly treated with tetranucleoside bovine serum albumin or tetranucleoside free of carrier produced the same amount of antibody to denatured DNA as did untreated mice of this strain. Mice that were rendered tolerant to denatured DNA by tetranucleoside isogeneic IgG failed to develop the chronic membranous glomerulonephritis that characterizes the renal lesions in animals of this strain."
https://openalex.org/W1536096456,"Abstract The absorption, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectra have been measured on oxidized and reduced reaction center preparations from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides strain R-26 at 295 and 77° K. The spectra indicate that the 4 bacteriochlorophyll a and 2 bacteriopheophytin a molecules in the reaction center are contained in a single pigment complex. The absorption bands at 893, 804, and 760 in the red and near-infrared each resolve into two separate CD maxima at 77°K. The interaction is very strong between the pigment molecules and their orientations are not coplanar. Oxidation of the reaction center bleaches the 893-nm absorption band of a bacteriochlorophyll dimer and the two corresponding CD maxima disappear. The changes in the low temperature fluorescence and CD spectra suggest that the molecular orientation may change when the reaction center is oxidized."

Soluble concanavalin A consistently stimulates 80 to 90 percent of rabbit peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the morphologic changes associated with such transformation may be observed within 18 hours after stimulation. Approximately 80 percent of rabbit peripheral blood lymphocytes have demonstrable immunoglobulin markers. These and other observations suggest that most rabbit peripheral blood lymphocytes are T cells with surface immunoglobulins."
https://openalex.org/W1504370687,"Abstract The pigments in reaction center preparations from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides strain R-26 have been characterized. The absorption spectra and magnesium content of both intact preparations and organic extracts as well as thin layer chromatography of the extracts indicate that the pigment complex of the reaction center contains both bacteriopheophytin a and bacteriochlorophyll a. The functional unit of the reaction center contains 2 bacteriopheophytin a molecules and 4 bacteriochlorophyll a molecules. In dark-adapted preparations, the extinction coefficients for the three red and near infrared absorption maxima of the reaction center are: 1.6 x 105 m-1 cm-1 at 757 nm, 3.0 x 105 m-1 cm-1 at 803 nm, and 1.4 x 105 m-1 cm-1 at 865 nm."

https://openalex.org/W1586855044,"Abstract Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, grown in suspension cultures, could be cultivated for a period of time in serum-free medium, in which they stopped growing but remained viable. Their rate of protein synthesis was about ½ that of growing cells. Following serum addition protein synthetic rates in these cells rose to values characteristic of growing cells. These high rates were sustained and the cells went on to divide; thus stimulation of protein synthesis was the initial part of a growth response. Accompanying the increase in protein synthetic rate was a marked redistribution of ribosomes, with ribosomes in the inactive monomer pool entering the polyribosomes. The faster sedimenting polyribosomes increased to a greater extent than the slower sedimenting ones, suggesting that mRNAs became more completely loaded with ribosomes. During this process the pools of ribosomal sub-units remained constant. Rates of protein synthesis calculated as per polyribosomal ribosome increased; thus, both the rates of initiation of translation and the rates of peptide chain elongation were enhanced following serum addition. The role of increased RNA synthesis in serum stimulation of protein synthesis was investigated by testing the ability of cells previously treated with actinomycin, cordycepin, or 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine to respond to serum. The results are best interpreted as showing that in each case the mRNA pool was significantly diminished, but that cells stimulated with serum were able to translate it with about double the efficiency of serum-starved cells. The possible mechanisms by which serum growth factor or factors may regulate the efficiency of translation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563193514,"Abstract Initiation of division of density-inhibited 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by fresh serum brought about increased uptake of thymidine and deoxycytidine which coincided closely in time with initiation of DNA synthesis. This increase was specific, for transport of deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine and orthophosphate did not change at the time of DNA synthesis. Although similar increases occurred for thymidine and deoxycytidine, kinetic studies indicated that they were taken up by different transport systems. The increased transport of thymidine represented an increase in net uptake, since uptake was stimulated more than efflux. Increased thymidine uptake was not caused by increased rates of DNA synthesis, since inhibition of DNA synthesis did not prevent the transport increase. In addition, it did not require thymidine kinase, since 3T3 cells lacking this enzyme showed the transport increase. Kinetic studies revealed that the increase was accompanied by an increased Vmax with no change in Km, indicating activation and/or increased amount of the same rather than a new transport system. Uptake of thymidine at both the basal and stimulated levels occurred by facilitated diffusion below about 5 µm and by passive diffusion above this concentration. Increased uptake of thymidine was prevented by cycloheximide and further increased by actinomycin D, suggesting that the increase required newly made protein(s) whose synthesis might be controlled at the post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1517076196,"Abstract When chloroacetaldehyde is added to dioldehydrase and coenzyme B12, tritium exchange with the C-5' hydrogen of enzyme-bound coenzyme B12 occurs without chemical modification of chloroacetaldehyde. The reaction also leads to loss of enzyme activity and the conversion of the adenosyl moiety of the enzyme-bound coenzyme to 5'-deoxyadenosine. 5'-Deoxyadenosine formation is stoichiometric with enzyme inactivation. We tentatively conclude that an enzyme-bound intermediate occurs which consists of 5'-deoxyadenosine or closely related compound and an adduct between chloroacetaldehyde and the cobalamin. The chloroacetaldehyde-cobalamin adduct, unlike that derived from other substrates, is unstable and decomposes to as yet unidentified products. As a result of this decomposition 5'-deoxyadenosine accumulates. Chloroacetaldehyde labels the enzyme covalently in the presence or absence of coenzyme. One mole of chloroacetaldehyde is introduced per mole of enzyme. This process is much slower than the enzyme inactivation which occurs when chloroacetaldehyde is added to the enzyme-coenzyme complex and is therefore not the cause of inactivation. Addition of chloroacetaldehyde to dioldehydrase-coenzyme B12, brings about a spectral change which is far more rapid than enzyme inactivation. The resulting spectrum is very similar to that of cob(II)alamin and indicates that essentially all of the enzyme-bound coenzyme is converted to cob(II)alamin. Addition of N2O to dioldehydrase-coenzyme B12 leads to a 10 to 15% reduction in rate, but no coenzyme inactivation was found. Our data do not warrant the conclusion, reached by others, that N2O reacts with cob(I)alamin derived from the coenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1553607212,"Abstract The nuclease from Ustilago maydis liberates oligonucleotides from heat-denatured DNA with a preferential attack at deoxyguanosine residues during the early course of hydrolysis. However, after exhaustive digestion, a large proportion of mononucleotides are found to accumulate. Examination of partial digests of denatured T7 DNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation indicates that the DNA is reduced progressively to smaller fragments. Single stranded circular DNA from phage φX174 is refractory to hydrolysis by the enzyme. This finding suggests that the enzyme requires DNA ends for activity. When DNA radioactively labeled specifically at either the 3' end or the 5' end is digested with the nuclease, the label is liberated at a faster rate than the total nucleotide. The enzyme introduces single strand breaks into linear duplex DNA, but will not degrade circular duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1538991266,"Abstract The binding of [1,2-3H]dihydrotestosterone by cytoplasmic extracts of submandibular glands from normal male mice and from mice carrying the X-linked gene for testicular feminization (Tfm/Y) has been studied by density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration. Androgen binding in this tissue was found exclusively in the portion of the gland that is known to contain androgen-dependent elements. No binding was demonstrated in the glands of either genotype immediately after birth, but at 2 weeks of age and after high affinity binding of the hormone was found in the glands of both male and Tfm animals. At all ages studied, the apparent dissociation constant for this binding was similar in the two genotypes (around 10 nm), but the number of binding sites in Tfm animals at 6 and 12 weeks was 3-fold higher. This difference did not appear to be the result of differential degradation during the preparation of the extracts. The observation that normal and Tfm animals have identical binding parameters at 2 weeks of age suggests: (a) that the postnatal development of androgen binding in submandibular gland is not androgen-dependent; (b) that androgen binding develops prior to the onset of sexual dimorphism of the gland; and (c) that the later development of enhanced binding of androgen by submandibular gland cytoplasm of the adult Tfm mouse is not caused by the appearance of an altered androgen binding protein but is the result of the accumulation of a physiologically normal binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1543217034,"Abstract DNA-dependent RNA polymerases from Rana catesbeiana livers were solubilized and chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex. RNA polymerases I and II were separated and their reaction characteristics determined. The tadpole RNA polymerases exhibited an optimal Mn++:Mg++ activity ratio, a denatured-native template preference and partial subunit structure, similar to those of rat liver RNA polymerases. The increased activity of RNA polymerases in nuclei after thyroxine treatment of the tadpoles was apparent even after the enzymes were solubilized, chromatographed, and assayed on exogenous templates. Cycloheximide treatment of tadpoles injected with thyroxine had no effect on the increase in RNA polymerase activity. These results suggest that neither changes in endogenous template activity nor de novo synthesis of protein are involved in the increase of RNA polymerase activity. The Km for UTP of RNA polymerase II from thyroxine-treated tadpoles was found to be approximately one-half that obtained from control RNA polymerases. These findings are of significance in relation to the intracellular transport of thyroxine to the nucleus and the resulting molecular changes involved in differentiation during metamorphosis."

https://openalex.org/W1538488473,"Abstract Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase-dependent cleavage of coenzyme B12 took place in the presence of succinyl-CoA, one of the substrates of the enzyme, and in the presence of malonyl-CoA, a competitive inhibitor (Ki 0.12 mm). Other competitive inhibitors of the reaction, including acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, and CoA itself, did not replace malonyl-CoA in this cleavage reaction. With both succinyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, the cleavage of coenzyme was progressive with time, without evidence for an initial burst. The cleavage reaction did not depend on oxygen, since it occurred under anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions. The adenosyl derivative formed by the cleavage of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin in the presence of each of the CoA esters was identified chromatographically as 5'-deoxyadenosine. Malonyl-CoA did not appear to be chemically altered during the course of the reaction; experimental difficulties precluded a similar investigation of the fate of succinyl-CoA. These experiments have shown that under certain circumstances, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is able to cleave the carbon-cobalt bond of coenzyme B12 with the production of 5'-deoxyadenosine. The findings are consistent with the view that the currently proposed mechanism of coenzyme B12-dependent rearrangements, which involves cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond followed by abstraction of a substrate hydrogen atom to form 5'-deoxyadenosine, may be generally valid for all reactions of this class."

https://openalex.org/W1575002892,"Abstract During natural metamorphosis, concomitant, linear increases were found in tadpole liver for the activities of the five enzymes in the ornithine-urea cycle: carbamyl phosphate synthetase I, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase. Upon immersion in 2.6 x 10-8 m l-thyroxine for two weeks, the biochemical changes which occur during natural metamorphosis were simulated with an elevation of the same enzymes by factors of 8.0, 3.3, 2.4, 2.3, and 3.0, respectively. The lag period prior to the initial rise of each enzyme activity was about 4 days. On the basis of the rate of change of the leg to tail ratio, the thyroxine-exposed tadpoles had an earlier, steeper rise in the levels of each of the five enzymes than that observed during natural metamorphosis. Argininosuccinate synthetase had the lowest specific activity of the ornithine-urea cycle enzymes, even though the assay was improved by the inclusion of urease in the incubation mixture, yielding higher activities than earlier reported. Plotting one enzyme against each of the other ornithine-urea cycle enzymes gave straight lines with high correlation coefficients and similar slopes for both natural and thyroxine-induced metamorphosis. These results demonstrate the simultaneous, concerted response of both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial enzymes in the ornithine-urea cycle enzymes during thyroxine-induced metamorphosis."

When the peripheral L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, L-α-methyl-α-hydrazino-β-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (HMD) is administered prior to 5-hydroxytryptophan, the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in kidneys does not rise, that of the brain increases slightly, and that of the adrenal rises markedly. This indicates that although the adrenal gland is a peripheral organ, it does not respond in the typical manner to the antidecarboxylase action of HMD. These results suggest that HMD does not gain free access into the adrenal medulla and that a possible ""blood-adrenal barrier"" may exist to this compound."

In contrast to the parent strain 8081, which takes up very little folate, the uptake of folate by the mutant is a concentrative, saturable, and energy-dependent process. At low extracellular concentration (0.22 µm), folate which enters the cells is immediately metabolized, its uptake being rate limiting. Polyglutamates of reduced folate derivatives of unknown composition accumulate in the cells. At high extracellular concentration (80.8 µm), unaltered folate accumulates inside the cells and is slowly metabolized, mainly to N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. Folinic acid and amethopterin inhibit the uptake of folate, suggesting that all three compounds may be taken up by the same mechanism. An unknown substance which seemed to be responsible for cessation of folate uptake by 8081/S cells after about 30 min of incubation was formed and excreted into the medium by both 8081 and 8081/S."
