https://openalex.org/W2328393125,"Jian Yang and colleagues propose a method that integrates summary data from GWAS and eQTL studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with complex traits because of pleiotropy. They apply the method to five human complex traits and prioritize 126 genes for future functional studies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with human complex traits. However, the genes or functional DNA elements through which these variants exert their effects on the traits are often unknown. We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation."
https://openalex.org/W2332044667,"Commensal gut bacteria impact the host immune system and can influence disease processes in several organs, including the brain. However, it remains unclear whether the microbiota has an impact on the outcome of acute brain injury. Here we show that antibiotic-induced alterations in the intestinal flora reduce ischemic brain injury in mice, an effect transmissible by fecal transplants. Intestinal dysbiosis alters immune homeostasis in the small intestine, leading to an increase in regulatory T cells and a reduction in interleukin (IL)-17-positive γδ T cells through altered dendritic cell activity. Dysbiosis suppresses trafficking of effector T cells from the gut to the leptomeninges after stroke. Additionally, IL-10 and IL-17 are required for the neuroprotection afforded by intestinal dysbiosis. The findings reveal a previously unrecognized gut-brain axis and an impact of the intestinal flora and meningeal IL-17(+) γδ T cells on ischemic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2329818534,"The corticospinal tract (CST) is the most important motor system in humans, yet robust regeneration of this projection after spinal cord injury (SCI) has not been accomplished. In murine models of SCI, we report robust corticospinal axon regeneration, functional synapse formation and improved skilled forelimb function after grafting multipotent neural progenitor cells into sites of SCI. Corticospinal regeneration requires grafts to be driven toward caudalized (spinal cord), rather than rostralized, fates. Fully mature caudalized neural grafts also support corticospinal regeneration. Moreover, corticospinal axons can emerge from neural grafts and regenerate beyond the lesion, a process that is potentially related to the attenuation of the glial scar. Rat corticospinal axons also regenerate into human donor grafts of caudal spinal cord identity. Collectively, these findings indicate that spinal cord 'replacement' with homologous neural stem cells enables robust regeneration of the corticospinal projection within and beyond spinal cord lesion sites, achieving a major unmet goal of SCI research and offering new possibilities for clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W2305558625,"Protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50% complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition."

Here, we show in vivo and in vitro that members of two non-overlapping neocortical IN populations, expressing somatostatin (SOM) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), are active as populations rather than individually. We demonstrate a variety of synergistic mechanisms, involving population-specific local excitation, GABAergic disinhibition and excitation through electrical coupling, which likely underlie IN population co-activity. Firing of a few SOM or VIP INs recruits additional members within the cell type via GABAergic and cholinergic mechanisms, thereby amplifying the output of the population as a whole.

Neuronal activity in the neocortex is organized to form groups of simultaneously active (co-active) cells termed ensembles (Harris, 2005Harris K.D.

Yet, the function of only one IN subpopulation, parvalbumin-expressing INs (PVs), has been studied during ongoing activity (Hofer et al., 2011Hofer S.B. Ko H. Pichler B. Vogelstein J. Ros H. Zeng H.

It is important to study co-activity patterns of other INs during ongoing activity, as it reflects flow of information through the cortical circuit without sensory driven thalamocortical input and is therefore the optimal situation to assess “spontaneously” generated co-activity of INs. Furthermore, ongoing activity is thought to be involved in memory replay and intrinsic mental states (Ch’ng and Reid, 2010Ch’ng Y.H. Reid R.C.

However, it is unclear how interneurons coordinate their activity within subpopulations. It is particularly puzzling how mutually inhibitory interneuron populations manage to operate together while embedded within a highly interconnected network. Indeed, while it is firmly established that nearby PCs excite PVs and SOMs with population-specific synaptic dynamics (Beierlein et al., 2003Beierlein M. Gibson J.R. Connors B.W.

Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P.

Selective attention. Long-range and local circuits for top-down modulation of visual cortex processing.Science. 2014; 345: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the neocortex has several complementary and overlapping mechanisms that can promote coordinated firing within genetically defined interneuron populations. First, we demonstrate within-population co-activity of both SOMs and VIPs in vivo using two-photon calcium imaging. Second, we show that nearby PCs excite SOMs and VIPs with different synaptic dynamics and that VIPs and SOMs receive local excitation from separate subnetworks of PCs. We show that the specific pattern of electrical and inhibitory connectivity among VIPs, SOMs, and PVs can mediate population co-activity. Finally, we show that the firing of a small fraction of the SOM or VIP population is sufficient to recruit other neurons in the same cell class, thereby demonstrating a circuit mechanism of interneuron excitation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that neocortical interneuron populations have multiple specializations that can promote within-population co-activity. We first investigated spontaneous activity patterns of VIPs and SOMs by recording ongoing activity while mice were awake in a dark room. We used two-photon Ca2+ imaging through a thinned skull in primary visual cortex (V1) of VIP-cre::LSL-TOM and SOM-cre::LSL-TOM mice injected with AAV1-syn-GCAMP6s (Figure 1). Both VIPs and SOMs were co-active with their population members (Figures 1A, 1B, 1E, and 1F; Movies S1 and S2). Since activity of VIPs and SOMs is modulated by animal movement (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P. A cortical circuit for gain control by behavioral state.Cell. 2014; 156: 1139-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, Polack et al., 2013Polack P.O. Friedman J. Golshani P. Cellular mechanisms of brain state-dependent gain modulation in visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we divided the data into “stationary” and “locomotion” epochs measured by monitoring movement of the running disk the mice were on. During both epochs and across 11 movies from five animals (5–19 VIPs and 41–137 non-VIPs per movie), VIP pairs had higher pairwise correlation coefficients than non-VIP pairs or VIP/non-VIP pairs (Figures 1C and 1D, statistics in figure legends). To avoid potential systematic biases in the ΔF/F correlations, we repeated the analyses with binarized data (see Experimental Procedures) and obtained similar results (Figures 1C and 1D). We performed the same analyses on eight movies from four SOM-cre::LSL-TOM mice (4–12 SOMs and 39–75 non-SOMs per movie) and found that SOMs are also co-active together (Figures 1G and 1H). We further analyzed the movies with highest amounts of GCAMP-expressing and active INs by counting how many INs were active together in the same frame in binarized data. This analysis also indicated that VIPs and SOMs are more co-active than shuffled surrogate data or the other cells in the imaged region (Figure S1). Locomotion increased the pairwise correlations within both VIP (stationary R = 0.07 ± 0.01, locomotion R = 0.13 ± 0.03, p = 0.038) and SOM populations (stationary R = 0.13 ± 0.04, locomotion R = 0.22 ± 0.04, p = 0.005), consistent with increased neuronal activity during animal movement. Together, these data demonstrate that VIPs and SOMs tend to be active together with their population members during ongoing neuronal activity. Therefore, we next went on to study the underpinnings of within population co-activity in slices using electrophysiology. It has been suggested that VIPs and SOMs might receive unspecific excitatory input from surrounding PCs (Kerlin et al., 2010Kerlin A.M. Andermann M.L. Berezovskii V.K. Reid R.C. Broadly tuned response properties of diverse inhibitory neuron subtypes in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 67: 858-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) similarly to PVs (Hofer et al., 2011Hofer S.B. Ko H. Pichler B. Vogelstein J. Ros H. Zeng H. Lein E. Lesica N.A. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Differential connectivity and response dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To probe this directly, we used multi-cell patch clamp to assess connectivity parameters between nearby (intersomatic distances 20–100 μm) PCs and VIPs or SOMs in triple-transgenic VIP-cre::LSL-TOM::SOM-GFP(GIN) slices (see Experimental Procedures). PCs formed excitatory synapses onto VIPs and SOMs at similar rates, but synapses onto VIPs were depressing, while those onto SOMs were facilitating (Figure 2A). Additional recordings in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) also demonstrated a depressing synaptic PC → VIP connection (5/38 connections, 13%) suggesting that the organization of SOM versus VIP excitation dynamics is conserved across sensory cortices. The differences in excitatory input dynamics suggest that VIPs and SOMs will be active at different times during excitatory afferent drive of these circuits. To see whether these dynamics have an impact when the whole microcircuit is activated, we elicited network activation in slice by a broad optogenetic activation (Figure 2B). We expressed the excitatory opsin C1V1 under the CaMKIIα promoter (CaMKIIα-C1V1(E162T)-p2A-EYFP) to direct it mostly to PCs (Coultrap and Bayer, 2012Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U. CaMKII regulation in information processing and storage.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Packer et al., 2012Packer A.M. Peterka D.S. Hirtz J.J. Prakash R. Deisseroth K. Yuste R. Two-photon optogenetics of dendritic spines and neural circuits.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) in VIP-cre::LSL-TOM::SOM-GFP(GIN) animals. We then patched a VIP and a SOM (at 50–150 μm intersomatic distance) and activated the circuit with a continuous 0.5-s pulse of green light (Figure 2B). The light stimulus recruited sustained 22 ± 8 Hz firing in 50% of PCs recorded in the same preparations for calibration (Figure 2B). VIPs and SOMs were recruited in a highly stereotyped manner during optogenetic activation; VIPs tended to fire a single action potential (AP) in the beginning of the 0.5-s light pulse, followed by quiescence, while SOMs ramped up to an average firing rate of 26 ± 7 Hz during the pulse (Figure 2B). This broad activation of the local microcircuit includes axon terminals expressing C1V1; therefore, these results may be due to multiple complex network interactions among the excitatory and inhibitory cell types. To better characterize the cellular elements stimulated by light under these conditions, we also recorded from PVs in PV-cre::LSL-TOM animals and found that 65% (11/17) of PVs were recruited to a sustained firing at 46 ± 9 Hz by the light step. Thus, under this broad excitation of inhibitory as well as excitatory local circuit elements, activation of VIPs and SOMs was consistent with the PC → SOM and PC → VIP synaptic dynamics shown in Figure 2A. Several recent studies have identified VIPs as recipients of long-range excitatory input (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P.

However, it is unclear to what extent local PCs innervate VIPs. To address this, we assessed the extent to which VIPs, compared to SOMs, are innervated by nearby PCs, by tracing presynaptic neurons of VIPs and SOMs with rabies (see Experimental Procedures). Since similar experiments have been performed in V1 (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P.

Long-range and local circuits for top-down modulation of visual cortex processing.Science. 2014; 345: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), we did this in S1. This yielded tissue sections where SOM or VIP starter cells carry both nucleus-localized GFP and cytoplasmic mCherry, and cells presynaptic to these express only mCherry (Figure 2C). Most presynaptic cells (68%, 8,643/12,641 cells) had clear pyramidal morphology (Figure 2D), while 13% (1594/12641) were not pyramidal, i.e., likely INs with small, round bipolar or multipolar somata, and 19% (2,404/12,641) we were unable to reliably categorize based on soma morphology. These proportions were not significantly different between VIP-cre (PCs 65% ± 4%, INs 11% ± 2%, ambiguous 23% ± 3%) and SOM-cre brains (PCs 70% ± 6%, INs 13% ± 2%, ambiguous 18% ± 4%, p > 0.27 for each comparison). This is consistent with the much higher proportion of PCs than INs in cortex. We counted starter and presynaptic cells at the injection site across four VIP-cre and three SOM-cre brains and found that VIPs and SOMs get input from nearby cells to a similar extent (Figure 2E; VIPs: 93 ± 29 starters and 1,259 ± 409 presynaptic cells/brain; SOMs: 118 ± 14 starters and 2,535 ± 641 presynaptic cells/brain; p > 0.1). We annotated positions of labeled somata in the coronal sections and aligned these maps by the pial surface. The resulting average cell density heatmaps (Figures 2F, S2A, and S2B) indicate that both cell types receive input most heavily from L2/3. The layer differences in VIP and SOM starters were characteristic of their layer distribution (Figure S2C). These data show that in addition to the long-range inputs described previously, VIPs get excitatory synaptic input from nearby PCs to a similar extent as SOMs. This local excitation may thus be the most important driver of interneurons (Hofer et al., 2011Hofer S.B. Ko H. Pichler B. Vogelstein J. Ros H. Zeng H. Lein E. Lesica N.A. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Differential connectivity and response dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in visual cortex.Nat.

To assess differences in spontaneous excitatory input to VIPs and SOMs in the same preparation, we made simultaneous current-clamp recordings from them in slices from VIP-cre::LSL-TOM::SOM-GFP(GIN) animals. When recording from two VIPs and two SOMs simultaneously in current clamp, we sometimes observed spontaneous activations occurring simultaneously only in the SOMs, while the VIPs were instead hyperpolarized (Figure 3A). We quantified the occurrence of these events (defined as spontaneous depolarizing events exceeding 5 mV for at least 500 ms) and classified these as shared between two cells if they overlapped. The analyzed neuron pairs were recorded for 285–1,700 s (n = 36 recorded pairs; 12 from S1 and 24 from V1) and average event frequency per neuron was 0.0031 ± 0.0006 Hz (n = 26 cells). Out of 62 SOM activations recorded with another SOM, 55% were shared, while out of 91 SOM or VIP activations (all recordings contained one SOM and one VIP), only 8.8% were shared, and out of 25 VIP activations recorded with another VIP, 24% were shared (Figure 3B). Shared VIP activations were rare, probably since VIPs had an overall lower frequency of spontaneous activations (VIPs: 0.0017 ± 0.0008 Hz; SOMs: 0.0044 ± 0.0009 Hz). These data hint at a SOM-specific excitatory presynaptic population. To get more fine-grained information about population-specific excitation, we also analyzed shared voltage fluctuations in the resting membrane potential of simultaneously recorded SOMs and VIPs. We generated subthreshold membrane potential cross-correlograms for all cell pairs within and between interneuron classes recorded in slices from triple-transgenic mice (VIP-cre::LSL-TOM::SOM-GFP(GIN), VIP-cre::LSL-TOM::PV-GFP(G42) and PV-cre::LSL-TOM::SOM-GFP(GIN); Experimental Procedures; Figures 3C and S3A–S3C). All zero-offset correlation coefficients approached 0 at intersomatic distances above 150 μm (Figure 3D), suggesting that the correlation reflects shared synaptic inputs from nearby cells. We therefore used only neuron pairs closer than 150 μm for the following analyses (mean distances noted below). Correlation coefficients were not significantly different (p > 0.4) between SOM-SOM (0.054 ± 0.012, n = 13, intersomatic distance 57.4 ± 10.7 μm), VIP-PV (0.053 ± 0.016, n = 5, distance 56.9 ± 17.4 μm), and VIP-VIP pairs (0.041 ± 0.013, n = 11, distance 61.6 ± 11.9 μm). However VIP-SOM pairs had significantly lower correlations than all other pairs (0.014 ± 0.006, n = 18, p < 0.05, distance 61.8 ± 10.1 μm), supporting the notion that VIPs and SOMs are innervated by distinct sets of PCs. For comparison, we also measured cross-correlograms for PV-PV and PV-SOM pairs (Figures S3B and S3C). While PV-PV pairs had high zero-offset correlation coefficients (0.079 ± 0.029, n = 5), PV-SOM pairs had significantly lower correlations (0.016 ± 0.006, n = 18, p = 0.003; Figure S3C). In summary, membrane potential cross-correlations were high within populations and lowest across populations, with the exception of VIP-PV pairs. To directly assay common presynaptic partners of VIPs and SOMs, we used two-photon mapping (Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005Yoshimura Y. Callaway E.M.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder defined by severe developmental delay, movement disorders, profound speech impairment, and highly penetrant electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities and seizures (Williams et al., 2006Williams C.A.

The frequency, severity, and intractability of the seizures exact a heavy toll on the quality of life of individuals with AS and their caregivers (Thibert et al., 2013Thibert R.L. Larson A.M.

UBE3A encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, thereby targeting them for proteasomal degradation or otherwise altering their localization or function (Rotin and Kumar, 2009Rotin D.

Because mutations that selectively inhibit UBE3A ligase activity are sufficient to cause AS, improper ubiquitin substrate regulation likely contributes to the pathogenesis of the disorder (Cooper et al., 2004Cooper E.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 41208-41217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Unlike other cells, neurons express UBE3A exclusively from the maternal allele due to evolutionarily conserved, cell-type-specific epigenetic mechanisms that silence the paternal UBE3A allele (Rougeulle et al., 1997Rougeulle C.

Allelic specificity of Ube3a expression in the mouse brain during postnatal development.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 1874-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Accordingly, neurons are especially vulnerable to loss of maternal UBE3A. Previously, we utilized a maternal Ube3a-null (Ube3am−/p+) mouse model of AS (Jiang et al., 1998Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L. Mutation of the Angelman ubiquitin ligase in mice causes increased cytoplasmic p53 and deficits of contextual learning and long-term potentiation.Neuron. 1998; 21: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) to explore the neural basis of hyperexcitability phenotypes in the disorder. We discovered that severe reduction of inhibitory GABAergic input to layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons outweighs corresponding losses of excitatory glutamatergic input, possibly contributing to neocortical hyperexcitability. Recovery of inhibitory synaptic transmission following high-frequency stimulation is severely compromised and is associated with accumulations of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) at GABAergic presynaptic terminals onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Wallace et al., 2012Wallace M.L. Burette A.C. Weinberg R.J. Philpot B.D. Maternal loss of Ube3a produces an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance through neuron type-specific synaptic defects.Neuron. 2012; 74: 793-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Maternal Ube3a deficiency may thus disrupt presynaptic vesicle cycling in GABAergic neurons, possibly through the dysregulation of UBE3A substrates that directly or indirectly compromise clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Conversely, it is possible that loss of maternal Ube3a expression in glutamatergic neurons compromises the postsynaptic effects of GABA on L2/3 pyramidal neurons, thereby contributing to hyperexcitability within the microcircuit and throughout the brain. In support of this latter possibility, modulation of expression or activity levels of ARC or the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II-α subunit (CaMKII-α)—both of which are preferentially expressed by glutamatergic forebrain neurons—has been shown to rescue circuit hyperexcitability and seizures in Ube3am−/p+ mice (van Woerden et al., 2007van Woerden G.M. Harris K.D. Hojjati M.R. Gustin R.M. Qiu S. de Avila Freire R. Jiang Y.H. Elgersma Y. Weeber E.J.

Seizure-like activity in a juvenile Angelman syndrome mouse model is attenuated by reducing Arc expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, an immediate goal is to determine whether maternal Ube3a loss restricted to either GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons is sufficient to impair GABAergic inhibition onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons, thereby leading to broader circuit-level and behavioral manifestations of hyperexcitability. Here we utilize novel conditional Ube3a mouse models to identify the neurons and neural circuits underlying the pathogenesis of circuit hyperexcitability in AS. We focus on selective Ube3a loss from GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, which are largely responsible for orchestrating the balance between excitation and inhibition in cerebral circuits. Our results provide compelling evidence that GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, Ube3a loss is responsible for mediating the EEG abnormalities and seizures that affect individuals with AS. To enable genetic dissection of neuron-type-specific contributions to circuit hyperexcitability in AS, we generated a novel mouse with maternal inheritance of a floxed Ube3a allele (Ube3aFLOX/p+) (Figure S1). We first crossed Ube3aFLOX/p+ mice to a Gad2-Cre line in which Cre is expressed by almost all inhibitory GABAergic neurons throughout the brain (Taniguchi et al., 2011Taniguchi H. He M. Wu P. Kim S. Paik R. Sugino K. Kvitsiani D. Fu Y. Lu J. Lin Y. et al.A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 995-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). We immunohistochemically confirmed loss of UBE3A expression by GABAergic interneurons in adult Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice, including parvalbumin-expressing subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) (Figure 1A2). The density of these interneuron subtypes in V1 was normal (Figure S2A), indicating that GABAergic Ube3a loss does not grossly disrupt GABAergic neuronal architecture in the neocortex. Moreover, GABAergic Ube3a loss in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice proved to be selective, as UBE3A co-staining with the L2–4 glutamatergic neuron marker, Cux1 (Nieto et al., 2004Nieto M. Monuki E.S. Tang H. Imitola J. Haubst N. Khoury S.J. Cunningham J. Gotz M. Walsh C.A. Expression of Cux-1 and Cux-2 in the subventricular zone and upper layers II-IV of the cerebral cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 479: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), was intact (Figures 1A1 and 1A2). We then sought to determine if GABAergic neuron-specific loss of maternal Ube3a is sufficient to alter synaptic drive onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons, testing Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice for the same spectrum of synaptic defects that we had previously observed in V1 of AS model mice (Ube3am−/p+) (Wallace et al., 2012Wallace M.L. Burette A.C. Weinberg R.J. Philpot B.D. Maternal loss of Ube3a produces an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance through neuron type-specific synaptic defects.Neuron. 2012; 74: 793-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As expected, we found no difference in mEPSC amplitude or frequency onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre compared to Control mice (Figure S2B). We also observed normal mIPSC amplitude and frequency in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice (Figure 1C), indicating that spontaneous GABAergic synaptic transmission remains intact following GABAergic neuron-specific loss of maternal Ube3a. This was unexpected, in view of previous evidence that decreased mIPSC frequency is a core GABAergic synaptic defect onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in Ube3am−/p+ mice (Table 1) (Wallace et al., 2012Wallace M.L. Burette A.C. Weinberg R.J. Philpot B.D.

We were even more surprised to find that GABAergic Ube3a loss yields neither of two core deficits in electrically evoked inhibition observed in Ube3am−/p+ mice: decreased evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current (eIPSC) amplitude or blunted recovery of GABAergic synaptic responses following high-frequency stimulation (Table 1). By stimulating (150 μm inferior to the recorded neuron) at a range of intensities, we revealed that eIPSC response amplitudes in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice are equivalent to Control (Figure 1D), indicating that the strength of GABAergic inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons develops normally following GABAergic Ube3a loss. To test the recovery of GABAergic synaptic transmission following high-frequency stimulation, we applied a train of 800 stimuli at 30 Hz to deplete reserves of GABAergic vesicles, followed immediately by 0.33 Hz stimulation to allow for recovery (Figure 1E1). We recorded eIPSC amplitudes from L2/3 pyramidal neurons during both phases of this experiment, to gauge rates of GABAergic synaptic depletion and recovery. Depletion of eIPSC amplitude in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice was equivalent to Control (Figure 1E2), as was recovery (Figure 1E3). Although eIPSC paired-pulse ratio in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice was subtly decreased when stimulating with a 100 ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI), eIPSC paired-pulse with 33 ms ISI was normal (Figure S2C). Thus, short-term plasticity at this synapse is largely intact following GABAergic Ube3a loss, particularly in response to the stimulation frequency we used to deplete GABAergic synapses (Figure 1E2). Importantly, nervous system-wide deletion of Ube3aFLOX/p+ (Ube3aFLOX/p+::Nestin-Cre) produced a loss of Ube3a expression that was indistinguishable from Ube3a loss in Ube3am−/p+ mice (Figure S3); moreover, Ube3aFLOX/p+::Nestin-Cre mice closely phenocopied L2/3 GABAergic synaptic defects in Ube3am−/p+ mice (Table 1; Figure S4). Ube3aFLOX thus appears to be a viable conditional null allele, supporting the lack of phenotypic penetrance in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice as a genuine finding, rather than an artifact of residual Ube3a function following Gad2-Cre-mediated deletion. Collectively, these observations indicate that GABAergic Ube3a loss does not severely impair GABAergic synaptic drive onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons as results from Ube3a loss in all neurons (Table 1). To model glutamatergic Ube3a loss in a manner truly reciprocal to GABAergic Ube3a loss in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice, we crossed conditional Ube3a reinstatement mice (Ube3aSTOP/p+) to the same Gad2-Cre line. Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice constitute a conditional AS model in which expression of the maternal Ube3a allele is interrupted by targeted insertion of a floxed STOP cassette. Cre-mediated excision of the STOP cassette fully reinstates neuronal UBE3A expression in Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice (Silva-Santos et al., 2015Silva-Santos S. van Woerden G.M. Bruinsma C.F. Mientjes E. Jolfaei M.A. Distel B. Kushner S.A. Elgersma Y. Ube3a reinstatement identifies distinct developmental windows in a murine Angelman syndrome model.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Hence, when we crossed Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice to Gad2-Cre mice (Ube3aSTOP/p+::Gad2-Cre), we observed UBE3A reinstatement that was specific to GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex, leaving neighboring Cux1-expressing glutamatergic neurons devoid of UBE3A expression in L2/3 neocortex (Figure 2A). Thus, Ube3aSTOP/p+::Gad2-Cre mice are an appropriate model of glutamatergic Ube3a loss. To evaluate whether glutamatergic Ube3a loss in Ube3aSTOP/p+::Gad2-Cre mice could impair GABAergic synaptic drive onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons, we first needed to determine the extent to which Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice recapitulated key GABAergic synaptic defects. We found that Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice closely phenocopied Ube3am−/p+ and Ube3aFLOX/p+::Nestin-Cre mice with respect to reduced eIPSC amplitude (Figure 2C) and blunted recovery from inhibitory synaptic depletion (Figure 2D). However, Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice failed to exhibit mIPSC amplitude or frequency deficits despite our experimentation with near-physiological as well as increased intracellular chloride levels (Figures S5B and S5C). It is possible that Ube3aSTOP allele readthrough provided enough Ube3a expression, albeit very low (Silva-Santos et al., 2015Silva-Santos S. van Woerden G.M. Bruinsma C.F. Mientjes E.

Invest. 2015; 125: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), to selectively mitigate penetrance of the mIPSC deficit. Regardless of the underlying reason for this result, we were limited to evaluating only eIPSC amplitude and GABAergic synaptic recovery in Ube3aSTOP/p+::Gad2-Cre mice. Ube3aSTOP/p+::Gad2-Cre mice proved to be statistically indistinguishable from Ube3aSTOP/p+ (but also Control) mice on measures of eIPSC amplitude (Figure 2C), providing a clue that glutamatergic Ube3a loss diminishes L2/3 pyramidal neuron responses to evoked GABAergic neurotransmission. Similar to Ube3aSTOP/p+ and Control mice, Ube3aSTOP/p+::Gad2-Cre mice showed no impairment on measures of mEPSCs, eIPSC paired-pulse ratios, or inhibitory synaptic depletion dynamics (Figures S5A, S5D, S5E1, and S5E2). In contrast, the blunted recovery from GABAergic synaptic depletion that we observed in Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice was completely absent in Ube3aSTOP/p+::Gad2-Cre mice (Figure 2D). This result demonstrates that glutamatergic Ube3a loss, just like GABAergic Ube3a loss (Figure 1E), fails to impair GABAergic synaptic recovery from high-frequency stimulation. Selective manipulations of glutamatergic Ube3a expression in the neocortex should affect the penetrance of eIPSC amplitude deficits, assuming these deficits are secondary to an intrinsic loss of UBE3A function within L2/3 pyramidal neurons. We tested this assumption with several approaches. First, we crossed Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice to a NEX-Cre line (Ube3aSTOP/p+::NEX-Cre) in which Ube3a is selectively reinstated in glutamatergic neurons of the dorsal pallium, including Cux1-positive neurons of L2/3 neocortex (Figure 3A3). eIPSC amplitudes in Ube3aSTOP/p+::NEX-Cre mice were similar to Control (Figures 3B and 3C), supporting that this deficit in Ube3aSTOP/p+ mice is driven by glutamatergic, not GABAergic, Ube3a loss in L2/3 neocortex, in agreement with our findings from Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice (Figure 1D). To further demonstrate the neuron type specificity of this phenotype, we probed Ube3aFLOX/p+::NEX-Cre mice (Figure 3A4), observing that neocortical glutamatergic Ube3a deletion was sufficient to yield the eIPSC deficit (Figures 3D and 3E). Finally, to test the cell autonomy of the effect, we intracerebroventricularly delivered low titers of Cre-expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV-Cre) to neonatal Ube3aFLOX/p+ and Ube3am+/p+ control littermates (Figure S6A1). This produced a sparse mosaic of virally transduced neocortical neurons, including pyramidal neurons, which we identified by expression of a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter. We observed a total loss of UBE3A expression in over 80% of tdTomato-positive neurons in Ube3aFLOX/p+ mice by P12 (Figures S6A3 and S6A4). Conversely, almost all (>90%) tdTomato-positive neurons expressed UBE3A in Ube3am+/p+ littermates (Figures S6A2 and S6A4). We measured eIPSC amplitude in mice prepared in this manner at ∼P80, recording from tdTomato-positive L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Ube3aFLOX/p+::AAV-Cre or Ube3am+/p+::AAV-Cre), as well as neighboring non-transduced L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Ube3aFLOX/p+ or Ube3am+/p+) in V1 (Figure S6B1). We observed reduced eIPSC amplitude in response to a range of stimulation intensities in Ube3aFLOX/p+::AAV-Cre neurons compared to Ube3am+/p+::AAV-Cre, Ube3aFLOX/p+, or Ube3am+/p+ neurons (Figure S6B2 and S6B3). We therefore conclude that diminished eIPSC amplitude onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in AS mice is due to cell-autonomous consequences of Ube3a loss. Intriguingly, deficits in eIPSC amplitude in Ube3aFLOX/p+::NEX-Cre mice occurred in the absence of changes in either mIPSC amplitude or frequency (Figure 3F), indicating that synaptic GABAAR function may be normal following glutamatergic Ube3a deletion in the dorsal forebrain. This apparent phenotypic discrepancy may be explained by deficits in extrasynaptic, delta subunit-containing GABAARs (δ-GABAARs), which might only be revealed in instances of GABA spillover to extrasynaptic regions (for example, following strong electrical stimulation) (Wei et al., 2003Wei W. Zhang N. Peng Z. Houser C.R. Mody I. Perisynaptic localization of delta subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors and their activation by GABA spillover in the mouse dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10650-10661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because δ-GABAARs are the principal mediators of tonic inhibition onto pyramidal neurons in the neocortex (Brickley and Mody, 2012Brickley S.G. Mody I. Extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors: their function in the CNS and implications for disease.Neuron. 2012; 73: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we reasoned that glutamatergic Ube3a loss might selectively impair this mode of GABAergic transmission by L2/3 pyramidal neurons. To test this, we bath-applied a δ-GABAAR-selective concentration of THIP (Gaboxadol) to stimulate extrasynaptic GABAARs, followed by a saturating concentration of the competitive GABAAR antagonist, Gabazine (SR95531) (Figure 3G1). We recorded corresponding changes in holding current in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, finding that we could stimulate significantly less THIP/Gabazine-sensitive tonic current in Ube3aFLOX/p+::NEX-Cre mice relative to Control (Figure 3G2). This effect was not an artifact of decreased cell size, as capacitances between the two genotypes were equivalent (Control n = 30 cells, 64.06 ± 3 pF; Ube3aFLOX/p+::NEX-Cre n = 21 cells, 68.33 ± 4.71 pF; p = 0.43). Together, these observations support that glutamatergic Ube3a loss cell-autonomously impairs tonic GABAergic tone onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Converging lines of evidence implicate deficits in tonic inhibition in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. In particular, GABRD missense mutations that reduce δ-GABAAR-mediated currents are associated with generalized epilepsy in humans (Dibbens et al., 2004Dibbens L.M. Feng H.J. Richards M.C. Harkin L.A. Hodgson B.L. Scott D. Jenkins M. Petrou S. Sutherland G.R. Scheffer I.E. et al.GABRD encoding a protein for extra- or peri-synaptic GABAA receptors is a susceptibility locus for generalized epilepsies.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and Gabrd−/− mice are prone to seizures (Spigelman et al., 2002Spigelman I. Li Z. Banerjee P.K. Mihalek R.M. Homanics G.E. Olsen R.W. Behavior and physiology of mice lacking the GABAA-receptor delta subunit.Epilepsia. 2002; 43: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Maguire et al., 2005Maguire J.L. Stell B.M. Rafizadeh M. Mody I. Ovarian cycle-linked changes in GABA(A) receptors mediating tonic inhibition alter seizure susceptibility and anxiety.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that deficits owed to glutamatergic Ube3a loss, including impaired tonic δ-GABAAR-mediated inhibition onto pyramidal neurons, would correlate with enhanced seizure susceptibility. Latencies to seizure following an initial exposure to the putative GABAAR antagonist, flurothyl, provide a reliable index of seizure threshold in naive mice, and flurothyl seizures are highly penetrant regardless of genetic background (Krasowski, 2000Krasowski M.D. Differential modulatory actions of the volatile convulsant flurothyl and its anesthetic isomer at inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels.Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1168-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, Kadiyala et al., 2014Kadiyala S.B.

Segregation of seizure traits in C57 black mouse substrains using the repeated-flurothyl model.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e90506Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We therefore used flurothyl to test seizure susceptibility in congenic C57BL/6 Ube3aFLOX/p+::NEX-Cre mice (Figures 4A1 and 4B ). Surprisingly, we found that their latency to myoclonic and generalized seizure was similar to Control (Figure 4C). This finding indicates that decreased tonic GABAergic inhibition onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons does not confer vulnerability to seizures. Nor, in all likelihood, does any other physiological consequence of glutamatergic Ube3a loss in the dorsal telencephalon. In contrast, pan-cerebral GABAergic Ube3a loss on a congenic C57BL/6 background yielded a dramatic reduction in latency to myoclonus and generalized seizure, and even enhanced lethality to repeated (once daily) exposures to flurothyl, as evinced by experiments in Ube3aFLOX/p+::Gad2-Cre mice (Figures 4A2 and 4D). Notably, NEX-Cre does not mediate glutamatergic Ube3a deletion in ventral neuron populations, nor in the majority of dentate granule neurons (Figure 4A1) (Goebbels et al., 2006Goebbels S. Bormuth I.

https://openalex.org/W2303196319,"The cortical local field potential (LFP) is a common measure of population activity, but its relationship to synaptic activity in individual neurons is not fully established. This relationship has been typically studied during anesthesia and is obscured by shared slow fluctuations. Here, we used patch-clamp recordings in visual cortex of anesthetized and awake mice to measure intracellular activity; we then applied a simple method to reveal its coupling to the simultaneously recorded LFP. LFP predicted membrane potential as accurately as synaptic currents, indicating a major role for synaptic currents in the relationship between cortical LFP and intracellular activity. During anesthesia, cortical LFP predicted excitation far better than inhibition; during wakefulness, it predicted them equally well, and visual stimulation further enhanced predictions of inhibition. These findings reveal a central role for synaptic currents, and especially inhibition, in the relationship between the subthreshold activity of individual neurons and the cortical LFP during wakefulness."
https://openalex.org/W2306536993,"Multiple division cycles without growth are a characteristic feature of early embryogenesis. The female germline loads proteins and RNAs into oocytes to support these divisions, which lack many quality control mechanisms operating in somatic cells undergoing growth. Here, we describe a small RNA-Argonaute pathway that ensures early embryonic divisions in C. elegans by employing catalytic slicing activity to broadly tune, instead of silence, germline gene expression. Misregulation of one target, a kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase, underlies a major phenotype associated with pathway loss. Tuning of target transcript levels is guided by the density of homologous small RNAs, whose generation must ultimately be related to target sequence. Thus, the tuning action of a small RNA-catalytic Argonaute pathway generates oocytes capable of supporting embryogenesis. We speculate that the specialized nature of germline chromatin led to the emergence of small RNA-catalytic Argonaute pathways in the female germline as a post-transcriptional control layer to optimize oocyte composition."
https://openalex.org/W2307657136,"Under defined differentiation conditions, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be directed toward a mesendoderm (ME) or neuroectoderm (NE) fate, the first decision during hESC differentiation. Coupled with lineage-specific G1 lengthening, a divergent ciliation pattern emerged within the first 24 hr of induced lineage specification, and these changes heralded a neuroectoderm decision before any neural precursor markers were expressed. By day 2, increased ciliation in NE precursors induced autophagy that resulted in the inactivation of Nrf2 and thereby relieved transcriptional activation of OCT4 and NANOG. Nrf2 binds directly to upstream regions of these pluripotency genes to promote their expression and repress NE derivation. Nrf2 suppression was sufficient to rescue poorly neurogenic iPSC lines. Only after these events had been initiated did neural precursor markers get expressed at day 4. Thus, we have identified a primary cilium-autophagy-Nrf2 (PAN) control axis coupled to cell-cycle progression that directs hESCs toward NE."

Electric stimulation has been used for decades to map connectivity and function in the intact as well as the diseased brain. In recent years the focus has shifted to a newer method called optogenetics, in which neuronal activity is modulated through light-sensitive ion channels (opsins). This approach promises to solve three problems of electrical microstimulation that otherwise cannot be easily overcome. (1) Electrical microstimulation cannot be applied to subpopulations of neurons unless they are anatomically segregated. With optogenetics, the expression of opsins can be targeted to neuronal subpopulations (Cardin et al., 2010Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.-H. Moore C.I. Targeted optogenetic stimulation and recording of neurons in vivo using cell-type-specific expression of Channelrhodopsin-2.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) or astrocytes (Perea et al., 2014Perea G. Yang A. Boyden E.S. Sur M. Optogenetic astrocyte activation modulates response selectivity of visual cortex neurons in vivo.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) via genetic markers to gain selective control over these cells. (2) Electrical microstimulation theoretically can depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons, but the exact effect on each neuron in an area can be hard to predict (Ranck, 1975Ranck Jr., J.B. Which elements are excited in electrical stimulation of mammalian central nervous system: a review.Brain Res. 1975; 98: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). In optogenetics, depolarization versus hyperpolarization effects at first sight appear to depend primarily on the choice of the opsin. However, the precise effect of optogenetic stimulation also can be sometimes ambiguous, for example, due to network effects or compensatory mechanisms due to altered ion concentration following stimulation (Raimondo et al., 2012Raimondo J.V. Kay L. Ellender T.J. Akerman C.J. Optogenetic silencing strategies differ in their effects on inhibitory synaptic transmission.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). (3) Electrical microstimulation is known to drive neuronal circuits both ortho- and antidromically, potentially resulting in a mixture of circuit activation effects (Bishop et al., 1962Bishop P.O. Burke W. Davis R. Single-unit recording from antidromically activated optic radiation neurones.J. Physiol. 1962; 162: 432-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Optogenetics promises to solve this limitation via the targeted opsin expression as well as the positioning of the stimulating fiber. The expression of opsins, however, usually occurs along the entire cell membrane, which can result in stimulation of axons as well. Here we investigated how the two techniques, optogenetics and electrical microstimulation, compare in mapping the cell-specific projection systems from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the primary visual cortex (V1). Neurons in the mammalian LGN relay the output of retinal ganglion cells to V1. In primates, parvo cells comprise 80% of all LGN neurons and, therefore, constitute the largest neuron population in the LGN. They form the four primary dorsal LGN layers and relay medium-wavelength color information to V1 (Hubel and Wiesel, 1966Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N.

Harting J.K. Patterns of retinal terminations and laminar organization of the lateral geniculate nucleus of primates.J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 182: 517-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Intercalated to these bands are the konio layers (Hendry and Yoshioka, 1994Hendry S.H. Yoshioka T. A neurochemically distinct third channel in the macaque dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.Science. 1994; 264: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, Kaas et al., 1978Kaas J.H.

Even though the konio cell population also constitutes 10% of LGN neurons and, as such, is as large as the magno population (Hendry and Reid, 2000Hendry S.H. Reid R.C. The koniocellular pathway in primate vision.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 127-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), its precise function is still not fully understood. There have been reports that cells of the koniocellular system respond to short-wavelength visual stimuli (Martin et al., 1997Martin P.R. White A.J. Goodchild A.K. Wilder H.D. Sefton A.E.

The three projection streams (magno, parvo, and konio) are segregated from each other inside the LGN and on their way to V1 (Hendrickson et al., 1978Hendrickson A.E. Wilson J.R. Ogren M.P.

Konio cells can be further distinguished from the remaining LGN cells on a biochemical level, as they are the only ones that express the calcium-binding protein CamKIIα (Hendry and Yoshioka, 1994Hendry S.H.

Here we applied CamKIIα cell-targeted optogenetic channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) stimulation to LGN konio layers, and we simultaneously recorded electrophysiological responses across the laminae of V1 in four anesthetized monkeys. We compared the results obtained with optogenetics to electrical microstimulation of different LGN layers. We injected adeno-associated virus particles (AAV5) that contained a DNA construct coding for the light-sensitive ion channel ChR2 and the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) under the control of a CamKIIα promoter into the right LGNs of four male macaque monkeys. In post-mortem histological examination LGN sections were stained for parvalbumin, which revealed the prominent laminar organization of LGN, with parvalbumin-dense magno and parvo cell layers interleaved with parvalbumin-pale regions (Figure 1A). The inverse pattern was found for the eYFP labeling with high density in the parvalbumin-free intercalated layers (Figure 1B; Figures S1A–S1C). Further histological analysis of the overlap between CamKIIα and eYFP expression confirmed that the majority of cells that labeled positive for eYFP also were expressing CamKIIα (Figure S1D; Table S1) and, therefore, conformed with the definition of konio cells (Hendry and Yoshioka, 1994Hendry S.H. Yoshioka T. A neurochemically distinct third channel in the macaque dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.Science. 1994; 264: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Neurons expressing eYFP also were encountered outside the intercalated layers where they formed cellular bridges (Figure S1E), as described by Hendry and Yoshioka, 1994Hendry S.H. Yoshioka T. A neurochemically distinct third channel in the macaque dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.Science. 1994; 264: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar. However, in addition to the predominant expression of eYFP in CamKIIα-positive LGN neurons, we also encountered eYFP labeling in parvalbumin-positive cells located in the magno- and parvocellular layers of LGN (Figure S1F). This false-positive expression of the construct has been reported before in rodents as well as the primate cortex (Watakabe et al., 2015Watakabe A. Ohtsuka M. Kinoshita M. Takaji M. Isa K. Mizukami H. Ozawa K. Isa T. Yamamori T. Comparative analyses of adeno-associated viral vector serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9 in marmoset, mouse and macaque cerebral cortex.Neurosci. Res. 2015; 93: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and seems to be related to the promoter sequence. Histological analysis of V1 sections in all four monkeys revealed most prominently an unexpected retrograde-traveling mechanism of the AAV5 particles that was evident by eYFP-labeled pyramidal neurons in V1 layer 6, which project back to the LGN (Lund et al., 1975Lund J.S. Lund R.D. Hendrickson A.E. Bunt A.H. Fuchs A.F. The origin of efferent pathways from the primary visual cortex, area 17, of the macaque monkey as shown by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase.J. Comp. Neurol. 1975; 164: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The percentage of retrogradely labeled layer 6 CamKII cells, however, was low (<1%; see Figure S2 and Table S1), also under the consideration that only 13% of V1 layer 6 neurons project back to the LGN (Fitzpatrick et al., 1994Fitzpatrick D. Usrey W.M. Schofield B.R. Einstein G. The sublaminar organization of corticogeniculate neurons in layer 6 of macaque striate cortex.Vis. Neurosci. 1994; 11: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, we also found labeled cell somata in V1 layer 4B for which there is no clear explanation at the moment (Figure S3). In addition to the prominent eYFP labeling in LGN and the retrograde expression in V1, we encountered labeling in the retina, superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus, medial geniculate body (MGB), and extrastriate cortex (Figures S2D and S4). While the pulvinar labeling and MGB labeling are likely the result of spread of the injected construct, the retinal labeling confirms the retrograde-labeling mechanism (Figure S2E). Taken together, these results demonstrate predominant expression of CamKIIα-ChR2-eYFP in LGN konio layers and additional weak expression in several other connected areas of the early visual system. Of 270 LGN single units that were recorded in four monkeys during anesthesia, we found that 23% (61/270 single units) increased their firing rate with short latency (<5 ms) during optogenetic stimulation with 473-nm blue light (Figure S5A). Also, 24.8% responded to blue light at a longer latency, 12.2% showed a decrease in firing rates, and 40.4% were not responsive to optogenetic stimulation. To ensure that non-specific heating artifacts associated with the laser stimulation did not cause the observed activation of LGN neurons, we performed control experiments using an intensity-matched red light (650-nm) laser. Under this condition no modulation of LGN activity was observed (Figure S5B). During electrophysiological recordings, LGN neurons have traditionally been dubbed konio if they lacked the clear characteristics of parvo or magno neurons and were encountered in intercalated layers (Irvin et al., 1986Irvin G.E.

Binocular Visual Responses in the Primate Lateral Geniculate Nucleus.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 3190-3195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We tested the visual responsivity in 53 from our total pool of 61 optogenetically identified short-latency neurons. Of these, only 43% (23 from 53 tested cells) showed responses to visual stimulation (luminance-matched drifting gratings, achromatic gratings, and colored dots; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details and Table S2 for a complete list of all cells), while the remaining neurons showed no changes in firing rates during visual stimulation (Figure S5C). Across all neurons that responded to visual stimuli, no obvious homogeneous tuning, e.g., selectivity to blue visual stimuli, was observed, although a few blue-responsive neurons were contained in our sample. This observation is in line with the heterogeneous response profile that has been reported previously for the koniocellular population (Norton and Casagrande, 1982Norton T.T. Casagrande V.A. Laminar organization of receptive-field properties in lateral geniculate nucleus of bush baby (Galago crassicaudatus).J. Neurophysiol. 1982; 47: 715-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, we are not able to exclude that expression of ChR2 in parvalbumin-positive cells or retrograde expression of the construct as described above also might have contributed to the encountered visual response heterogeneity among the optogenetically identified LGN neurons. In a next step, we assessed how the selective activation of LGN konio layers with optogenetics would drive electrophysiological responses in downstream area V1. To this end, we inserted a 24-channel lamina-sampling electrode into V1 and compared the layer-resolved V1 activity, elicited by either visual or optogenetic konio LGN stimulation (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 2A). Based on the average local field potential (LFP) responses across stimulation trials, we calculated the current source-density (CSD) profiles for the visual flicker and optogenetic conditions to assess V1 laminar activation. CSD analysis reveals areas of incoming current (Mitzdorf, 1985Mitzdorf U. Current source-density method and application in cat cerebral cortex: investigation of evoked potentials and EEG phenomena.Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 37-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) that reflects, in our case, the excitatory input from the LGN. Figure 2B shows representative CSD profiles from one session in monkey CM023. The CSD profile obtained under the visual flicker condition confirms the previously reported initial sink in granular layer 4 that presumably reflects incoming currents from the magno- and parvocellular LGN layers (Maier et al., 2011Maier A.

A spatiotemporal profile of visual system activation revealed by current source density analysis in the awake macaque.Cereb. Cortex. 1998; 8: 575-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In contrast to the visual stimulation, the CSD profile from the optogenetic stimulation of LGN konio layers did not show any current flow in V1 layer 4 and instead revealed a selective initial sink in the V1 supra-granular layers. This electrophysiological finding matches prior anatomical reports that konio cells project mainly to layers 1–3 of V1 (Casagrande et al., 2007Casagrande V.A. Yazar F. Jones K.D. Ding Y.

A neurochemically distinct third channel in the macaque dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.Science. 1994; 264: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To quantify this effect across experiments, we calculated the mean activation strength for all electrode contacts sampling from granular versus supra-granular layers, respectively, and plotted them against each other across all sessions (Figure 2C, population data of three monkeys). The resulting scatterplot showed two distinct clusters as follows: optogenetic stimulation sessions lay typically above the diagonal, whereas visual flicker stimulation resulted in points below the diagonal. This confirmed across our experiments and monkeys that, under the optogenetic stimulation condition, the activity in the supra-granular layers was significantly higher than in the granular layers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.0048, n = 41 opto sessions). In contrast, under the flicker condition, the activity was significantly higher in the granular layers compared to the supra-granular layers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 3.5237 × 10−12; n = 213 flicker sessions). Overall, we measured significantly higher supra-granular/granular activation ratios (Figure 2D) during optogenetics (mean = 2.92) compared to visual flicker (mean = 0.53) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 1.2835 × 10−18; n = 213 flicker sessions and 41 opto sessions). Therefore, by demonstrating selective activation of V1 supra-granular layers caused by optogenetic stimulation of LGN konio neurons, we were able to functionally identify the LGN konio pathway to V1. Unlike for optogenetics, a frequent concern for electrical microstimulation is that its effect on activating neuronal connections is uncontrolled and therefore unspecific. We wondered how the results we achieved with optogenetics would compare to those obtained with electrical microstimulation. Electrical microstimulation appears attractive for LGN due to its layered organization into spatially segregated projection streams (Wilson, 1986Wilson J.R. Synaptic connections of relay and local circuit neurons in the monkey’s dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 66: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To this end, we applied 50–100 μA electrical currents through a microstimulation electrode positioned in one of the parvo layers of the LGN. The electrically evoked CSD profile showed an initial sink in V1 granular layer 4, as predicted by ana"

The paper examines different functions of Twitter and the information hubs that drive and sustain conversation about the event. Content analysis shows that the majority of tweets contain information about the typhoon or its damage, and disaster relief activities. There are differences in types of content between the most retweeted messages and posts that are original tweets. Original tweets are more likely to come from ordinary users, who are more likely to tweet emotions, messages of support, and political content compared with official sources and key information hubs that include news organizations, aid organization, and celebrities. Original tweets reveal use of the site beyond information to relief coordination and response."
https://openalex.org/W2331950914,"Chemotherapeutic insensitivity remains a major obstacle to treating osteosarcoma effectively. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in drug resistance. However, the effect of miR-138 on cisplatin chemoresistance in osteosarcoma has not been reported. We used real-time PCR to detect the expression of mature miR-138 in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration assays were used to observe changes to the osteosarcoma malignant phenotype. MiR-138 was downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines, and miR-138 overexpression negatively regulated osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We also verified that EZH2 is a direct target of miR-138. Furthermore, enhancing EZH2 expression reduced the inhibitory effects of miR-138 on osteosarcoma. Proliferation, apoptosis assays and caspase-3 activity assay confirmed that elevated miR-138 expression enhanced osteosarcoma cell chemosensitivity to cisplatin by targeting EZH2. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that miR-138 acts as a tumor suppressor by enhancing osteosarcoma cell chemosensitivity and supports its potential application for treating osteosarcoma in the future."

This study describes the differences between steer progeny of two influential Angus bulls with divergent genomic predictions for residual feed intake (RFI). Eight steer progeny of each sire were phenotyped for growth and feed intake from 8 mo. of age (average BW 254 kg, with a mean difference between sire groups of 4.8 kg) until slaughter at 14–16 mo. of age (average BW 534 kg, sire group difference of 28.8 kg). Terminal samples from pituitary gland, skeletal muscle, liver, adipose, and duodenum were collected from each steer for transcriptome sequencing. Gene expression networks were derived using partial correlation and information theory (PCIT), including differentially expressed (DE) genes, tissue specific (TS) genes, transcription factors (TF), and genes associated with RFI from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Relative to progeny of the high RFI sire, progeny of the low RFI sire had -0.56 kg/d finishing period RFI (P = 0.05), -1.08 finishing period feed conversion ratio (P = 0.01), +3.3 kg^0.75 finishing period metabolic mid-weight (MMW; P = 0.04), +28.8 kg final body weight (P = 0.01), -12.9 feed bunk visits per day (P = 0.02) with +0.60 min/visit duration (P = 0.01), and +0.0045 carcass specific gravity (weight in air/weight in air—weight in water, a predictor of carcass fat content; P = 0.03). RNA-seq identified 633 DE genes between sire groups among 17,016 expressed genes. PCIT analysis identified >115,000 significant co-expression correlations between genes and 25 TF hubs, i.e. controllers of clusters of DE, TS, and GWAS SNP genes. Pathway analysis suggests low RFI bull progeny possess heightened gut inflammation and reduced fat deposition. This multi-omics analysis shows how differences in RFI genomic breeding values can impact other traits and gene co-expression networks."

Their analyses identify genomic regions that may contribute to bat wing formation. Bats are the only mammals capable of powered flight, but little is known about the genetic determinants that shape their wings. Here we generated a genome for Miniopterus natalensis and performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (H3K27ac and H3K27me3) analyses on its developing forelimb and hindlimb autopods at sequential embryonic stages to decipher the molecular events that underlie bat wing development. Over 7,000 genes and several long noncoding RNAs, including Tbx5-as1 and Hottip, were differentially expressed between forelimb and hindlimb, and across different stages. ChIP-seq analysis identified thousands of regions that are differentially modified in forelimb and hindlimb. Comparative genomics found 2,796 bat-accelerated regions within H3K27ac peaks, several of which cluster near limb-associated genes. Pathway analyses highlighted multiple ribosomal proteins and known limb patterning signaling pathways as differentially regulated and implicated increased forelimb mesenchymal condensation in differential growth. In combination, our work outlines multiple genetic components that likely contribute to bat wing formation, providing insights into this morphological innovation."

This study was initiated to identify SNP markers for characters expressed from the seedling stage to plant maturity in spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes adapted to western Canada. Three doubled haploid populations with the winter cultivar 'Norstar' as a common parent were developed and genotyped with a 90K Illumina iSelect SNP assay and a 2,998.9 cM consensus map with 17,541 markers constructed. High heritability's reflected large differences among the parents and relatively low genotype by environment interactions for all characters considered. Significant QTL were detected for the 15 traits examined. However, different QTL for days to heading in controlled environments and the field provided a strong reminder that growth and development are being orchestrated by environmental cues and caution should be exercised when extrapolating conclusions from different experiments. A QTL on chromosome 6A for minimum final leaf number, which determines the rate of phenological development in the seedling stage, was closely linked to QTL for low-temperature tolerance, grain quality, and agronomic characters expressed up to the time of maturity. This suggests phenological development plays a critical role in programming subsequent outcomes for many traits. Transgressive segregation was observed for the lines in each population and QTL with additive effects were identified suggesting that genes for desirable traits could be stacked using Marker Assisted Selection. QTL were identified for characters that could be transferred between the largely isolated western Canadian spring and winter wheat gene pools demonstrating the opportunities offered by Marker Assisted Selection to act as bridges in the identification and transfer of useful genes among related genetic islands while minimizing the drag created by less desirable genes."
https://openalex.org/W2331931099,"The aim of the present large population-based cohort study is to explore the risk factors of age-related mortality in liver transplant recipients in Taiwan. Basic information and data on medical comorbidities for 2938 patients who received liver transplants between July 1, 1998, and December 31, 2012, were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database on the basis of ICD-9-codes. Mortality risks were analyzed after adjusting for preoperative comorbidities and compared among age cohorts. All patients were followed up until the study endpoint or death. This study finally included 2588 adults and 350 children [2068 (70.4%) male and 870 (29.6%) female patients]. The median age at transplantation was 52 (interquartile range, 43-58) years. Recipients were categorized into the following age cohorts: <20 (n = 350, 11.9%), 20-39 (n = 254, 8.6%), 40-59 (n = 1860, 63.3%), and ≥60 (n = 474, 16.1%) years. In the total population, 428 deaths occurred after liver transplantation, and the median follow-up period was 2.85 years (interquartile range, 1.2-5.5 years). Dialysis patients showed the highest risk of mortality irrespective of age. Further, the risk of death increased with an increase in the age at transplantation. Older liver transplant recipients (≥60 years), especially dialysis patients, have a higher mortality rate, possibly because they have more medical comorbidities. Our findings should make clinicians aware of the need for better risk stratification among elderly liver transplantation candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2330690137,"Live animal movements are a major transmission route for the spread of infectious agents such as Mycobacterium bovis, the main agent of bovine Tuberculosis (bTB). France became officially bTB-free in 2001, but M. bovis is still circulating in the cattle population, with about a hundred of outbreaks per year, most located in a few geographic areas. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of cattle movements in bTB spread in France between 2005 and 2014, using social network analysis and logistic regression models. At a global scale, the trade network was studied to assess the association between several centrality measures and bTB infection though a case-control analysis. The bTB infection status was associated with a higher in-degree (odds-ratio [OR] = 2.4 [1.1-5.4]) and with a higher ingoing contact chain (OR = 2.2 [1.0-4.7]). At a more local scale, a second case-control analysis was conducted to estimate the relative importance of cattle movements and spatial neighbourhood. Only direct purchase from infected herds was shown to be associated with bTB infection (OR = 2.9 [1.7-5.2]), spatial proximity to infected herds being the predominant risk factor, with decreasing ORs when distance increases. Indeed, the population attributable fraction was 12% [5%-18%] for cattle movements and 73% [68%-78%] for spatial neighbourhood. Based on these results, networks of potential effective contacts between herds were built and analysed for the three major spoligotypes reported in France. In these networks, the links representing cattle movements were associated with higher edge betweenness than those representing the spatial proximity between infected herds. They were often links connecting distinct communities and sometimes distinct geographical areas. Therefore, although their role was quantitatively lower than the one of spatial neighbourhood, cattle movements appear to have been essential in the French bTB dynamics between 2005 and 2014."
https://openalex.org/W2323658202,"Sleep restriction causes impaired cognitive performance that can result in adverse consequences in many occupational settings. Individuals may rely on self-perceived alertness to decide if they are able to adequately perform a task. It is therefore important to determine the relationship between an individual’s self-assessed alertness and their objective performance, and how this relationship depends on circadian phase, hours since awakening, and cumulative lost hours of sleep. Healthy young adults (aged 18–34) completed an inpatient schedule that included forced desynchrony of sleep/wake and circadian rhythms with twelve 42.85-hour “days” and either a 1:2 (n = 8) or 1:3.3 (n = 9) ratio of sleep-opportunity:enforced-wakefulness. We investigated whether subjective alertness (visual analog scale), circadian phase (melatonin), hours since awakening, and cumulative sleep loss could predict objective performance on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), an Addition/Calculation Test (ADD) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Mathematical models that allowed nonlinear interactions between explanatory variables were evaluated using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Subjective alertness was the single best predictor of PVT, ADD, and DSST performance. Subjective alertness alone, however, was not an accurate predictor of PVT performance. The best AIC scores for PVT and DSST were achieved when all explanatory variables were included in the model. The best AIC score for ADD was achieved with circadian phase and subjective alertness variables. We conclude that subjective alertness alone is a weak predictor of objective vigilant or cognitive performance. Predictions can, however, be improved by knowing an individual’s circadian phase, current wake duration, and cumulative sleep loss."
https://openalex.org/W2319251666,"Whereas the infant gut microbiome is the subject of intense study, relatively little is known regarding the nares microbiome in newborns and during early life. This study aimed to survey the typical composition and diversity of human anterior nare microflora for developing infants over time, and to explore how these correlate to their primary caregivers. Single nare swabs were collected at five time points over a one-year period for each subject from infant-caregiver pairs. Our study comprised of 50 infants (recruited at 2 weeks, post delivery) and their 50 primary caregivers. Applying the chaperonin-60 (cpn60) universal target (UT) amplicon as our molecular barcoding marker to census survey the microbial communities, we longitudinally surveyed infant nares microbiota at 5 time points over the course of the first year of life. The inter- and intra-subject diversity was catalogued and compared, both longitudinally and relative to their adult primary caregivers. Although within-subject variability over time and inter-subject variability were both observed, the assessment detected only one or two predominant genera for individual infant samples, belonging mainly to phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Consistent with previously observed microbial population dynamics in other body sites, the diversity of nares microflora increased over the first year of life and infants showed differential operational taxonomic units (OTUs) relative to their matched primary caregiver. The collected evidence also support that both temporal and seasonal changes occur with respect to carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPBs), which may influence host predisposition to infection. This pilot study surveying paired infant/caregiver nare microbiomes provides novel longitudinal diversity information that is pertinent to better understanding nare microbiome development in infants."
https://openalex.org/W910943789,"Aerodynamic ground effect in flapping-wing insect flight is of importance to comparative morphologies and of interest to the micro-air-vehicle (MAV) community. Recent studies, however, show apparently contradictory results of either some significant extra lift or power savings, or zero ground effect. Here we present a numerical study of fruitfly sized insect takeoff with a specific focus on the significance of leg thrust and wing kinematics. Flapping-wing takeoff is studied using numerical modelling and high performance computing. The aerodynamic forces are calculated using a three-dimensional Navier--Stokes solver based on a pseudo-spectral method with volume penalization. It is coupled with a flight dynamics solver that accounts for the body weight, inertia and the leg thrust, while only having two degrees of freedom: the vertical and the longitudinal horizontal displacement. The natural voluntary takeoff of a fruitfly is considered as reference. The parameters of the model are then varied to explore possible effects of interaction between the flapping-wing model and the ground plane. These modified takeoffs include cases with decreased leg thrust parameter, and/or with periodic wing kinematics, constant body pitch angle. The results show that the ground effect during natural voluntary takeoff is negligible. In the modified takeoffs, when the rate of climb is slow, the difference in the aerodynamic forces due to the interaction with the ground is up to 6%. Surprisingly, depending on the kinematics, the difference is either positive or negative, in contrast to the intuition based on the helicopter theory, which suggests positive excess lift. This effect is attributed to unsteady wing-wake interactions. A similar effect is found during hovering."
https://openalex.org/W2319263628,"The plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play key roles in plant defenses against pathogens and several WRKY transcription factors have been shown to have a role in SA/JA crosstalk. In a previous study, overexpression of the poplar WRKY gene PtrWRKY89 enhanced resistance to pathogens in transgenic poplars. In this study, the promoter of PtrWRKY89 (ProPtrWRKY89) was isolated and used to drive GUS reporter gene. High GUS activity was observed in old leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis containing ProPtrWRKY89-GUS construct and GUS expression was extremely induced by SA solution and SA+MeJA mixture but not by MeJA treatment. Subcellular localization and transactivation assays showed that PtrWRKY89 acted as a transcription activator in the nucleus. Constitutive expression of PtrWRKY89 in Arabidopsis resulted in more susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae and Botrytis cinerea compared to wild-type plants. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed that marker genes of SA and JA pathways were down-regulated in transgenic Arabidopsis after pathogen inoculations. Overall, our results indicated that PtrWRKY89 modulates a cross talk in resistance to P. syringe and B. cinerea by negatively regulating both SA and JA pathways in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2328155623,"A complete neurobiological understanding of speech motor control requires determination of the relationship between simultaneously recorded neural activity and the kinematics of the lips, jaw, tongue, and larynx. Many speech articulators are internal to the vocal tract, and therefore simultaneously tracking the kinematics of all articulators is nontrivial—especially in the context of human electrophysiology recordings. Here, we describe a noninvasive, multi-modal imaging system to monitor vocal tract kinematics, demonstrate this system in six speakers during production of nine American English vowels, and provide new analysis of such data. Classification and regression analysis revealed considerable variability in the articulator-to-acoustic relationship across speakers. Non-negative matrix factorization extracted basis sets capturing vocal tract shapes allowing for higher vowel classification accuracy than traditional methods. Statistical speech synthesis generated speech from vocal tract measurements, and we demonstrate perceptual identification. We demonstrate the capacity to predict lip kinematics from ventral sensorimotor cortical activity. These results demonstrate a multi-modal system to non-invasively monitor articulator kinematics during speech production, describe novel analytic methods for relating kinematic data to speech acoustics, and provide the first decoding of speech kinematics from electrocorticography. These advances will be critical for understanding the cortical basis of speech production and the creation of vocal prosthetics."
https://openalex.org/W2331024971,"Artonin E is a prenylated flavonoid isolated from the stem bark of Artocarpus elasticus Reinw.(Moraceae). This study aimed to investigate the apoptotic mechanisms induced by artonin E in a metastatic human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 in vitro. MTT assay, clonogenic assay, acridine orange and propidium iodide double staining, cell cycle and annexin V analyses were performed to explore the mode of artonin E-induced cell death at different time points. DNA laddering, activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9, multi-parametric cytotoxicity-3 analysis by high-content screening, measurement of reactive oxygen species generation, and Western blot were employed to study the pathways involved in the apoptosis. MTT results showed that artonin E inhibited the growth of SKOV-3 cells, with IC50 values of 6.5±0.5 μg/mL after 72 h treatment, and showed less toxicity toward a normal human ovarian cell line T1074, with IC50 value of 32.5±0.5 μg/mL. Results showed that artonin E induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the S phase. This compound also promoted the activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9. Further investigation into the depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c revealed that artonin E treatment induced apoptosis via regulation of the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. The expression levels of survivin and HSP70 proteins were also down regulated in SKOV-3 cells treated with artonin E. We propose that artonin E induced an antiproliferative effect that led to S phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through dysregulation of mitochondrial pathways, particularly the pro- and anti-apoptosis signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2312618349,"This study evaluated the setup uncertainties for brain sites when using BrainLAB's ExacTrac X-ray 6D system for daily pretreatment to determine the optimal planning target volume (PTV) margin. Between August 2012 and April 2015, 28 patients with brain tumors were treated by daily image-guided radiotherapy using the BrainLAB ExacTrac 6D image guidance system of the Novalis-Tx linear accelerator. DUONTM (Orfit Industries, Wijnegem, Belgium) masks were used to fix the head. The radiotherapy was fractionated into 27-33 treatments. In total, 844 image verifications were performed for 28 patients and used for the analysis. The setup corrections along with the systematic and random errors were analyzed for six degrees of freedom in the translational (lateral, longitudinal, and vertical) and rotational (pitch, roll, and yaw) dimensions. Optimal PTV margins were calculated based on van Herk et al.'s [margin recipe = 2.5∑ + 0.7σ - 3 mm] and Stroom et al.'s [margin recipe = 2∑ + 0.7σ] formulas. The systematic errors (∑) were 0.72, 1.57, and 0.97 mm in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical translational dimensions, respectively, and 0.72°, 0.87°, and 0.83° in the pitch, roll, and yaw rotational dimensions, respectively. The random errors (σ) were 0.31, 0.46, and 0.54 mm in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical rotational dimensions, respectively, and 0.28°, 0.24°, and 0.31° in the pitch, roll, and yaw rotational dimensions, respectively. According to van Herk et al.'s and Stroom et al.'s recipes, the recommended lateral PTV margins were 0.97 and 1.66 mm, respectively; the longitudinal margins were 1.26 and 3.47 mm, respectively; and the vertical margins were 0.21 and 2.31 mm, respectively. Therefore, daily setup verifications using the BrainLAB ExacTrac 6D image guide system are very useful for evaluating the setup uncertainties and determining the setup margin."
https://openalex.org/W2326434216,"Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti) is mainly distributed in the upstream regions of the Yangtze River and its tributaries in China. This species is indigenous and commercially important. However, in recent years, wild populations and aquacultures have faced the serious challenges of germplasm variation loss and an increased susceptibility to a range of pathogens. Currently, the genetics and immune mechanisms of S. prenanti are unknown, partly due to a lack of genome and transcriptome information. Here, we sought to identify genes related to immune functions and to identify molecular markers to study the function of these genes and for trait mapping. To this end, the transcriptome from spleen tissues of S. prenanti was analyzed and sequenced. Using paired-end reads from the Illumina Hiseq2500 platform, 48,517 transcripts were isolated from the spleen transcriptome. These transcripts could be clustered into 37,785 unigenes with an N50 length of 2,539 bp. The majority of the unigenes (35,653, 94.4%) were successfully annotated using non-redundant nucleotide sequence analysis (nt), and the non-redundant protein (nr), Swiss-Prot, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. KEGG pathway assignment identified more than 500 immune-related genes. Furthermore, 7,545 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs), 857,535 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 53,481 insertion/deletion (InDels) were detected from the transcriptome. This is the first reported high-throughput transcriptome analysis of S. prenanti, and it provides valuable genetic resources for the investigation of immune mechanisms, conservation of germplasm, and molecular marker-assisted breeding of S. prenanti."
https://openalex.org/W2327350779,"Exotic plant invasions and chronic high levels of herbivory are two of the major biotic stressors impacting temperate forest ecosystems in eastern North America, and the two problems are often linked. We used a 4-ha deer exclosure maintained since 1991 to examine the influence of a generalist herbivore, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), on the abundance of four exotic invasive (Rosa multiflora, Berberis thunbergii, Rubus phoenicolasius and Microstegium vimineum) and one native (Cynoglossum virginianum) plant species, within a 25.6-ha mature temperate forest dynamics plot in Virginia, USA. We identified significant predictors of the abundance of each focal species using generalized linear models incorporating 10 environmental and landscape variables. After controlling for those predictors, we applied our models to a 4-ha deer exclusion site and a 4-ha reference site, both embedded within the larger plot, to test the role of deer on the abundance of the focal species. Slope, edge effects and soil pH were the most frequent predictors of the abundance of the focal species on the larger plot. The abundance of C. virginianum, known to be deer-dispersed, was significantly lower in the exclosure. Similar patterns were detected for B. thunbergii, R. phoenicolasius and M. vimineum, whereas R. multiflora was more abundant within the exclosure. Our results indicate that chronic high deer density facilitates increased abundances of several exotic invasive plant species, with the notable exception of R. multiflora. We infer that the invasion of many exotic plant species that are browse-tolerant to white-tailed deer could be limited by reducing deer populations."
https://openalex.org/W2319002931,"The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are genetic conditions in which there is progressive axonal degeneration in the corticospinal tract. Autosomal dominant mutations, including nonsense, frameshift and missense changes, in the gene encoding the microtubule severing ATPase spastin are the most common cause of HSP in North America and northern Europe. In this study we report quantitative gait analysis using a motorized treadmill system, carried out on mice knocked-in for a disease-associated mutation affecting a critical residue in the Walker A motif of the spastin ATPase domain. At 4 months and at one year of age homozygous mutant mice had a number of abnormal gait parameters, including in stride length and stride duration, compared to heterozygous and wild-type littermates. Gait parameters in heterozygous animals did not differ from wild-type littermates. We conclude that quantitative gait analysis using the DigiGait system sensitively detects motor abnormalities in a hereditary spastic paraplegia model, and would be a useful method for analyzing the effects of pharmacological treatments for HSP."
https://openalex.org/W2333374095,"Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase in eukaryotes that consists of a catalytic subunit A and a regulatory subunit B. Previous studies in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa had suggested that the catalytic subunit of calcineurin might be an essential protein. We generated N. crassa strains expressing the A (cna-1) and B (cnb-1) subunit genes under the regulation of Ptcu-1, a copper-responsive promoter. In these strains, addition of bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), a copper chelator, results in induction of cna-1 and cnb-1, while excess Cu2+ represses gene expression. Through analysis of these strains under repressing and inducing conditions, we found that the calcineurin is required for normal growth, asexual development and female fertility in N. crassa. Moreover, we isolated and analyzed cnb-1 mutant alleles generated by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), with the results further supporting roles for calcineurin in growth and fertility in N. crassa. We demonstrated a direct interaction between the CNA-1 and CNB-1 proteins using an assay system developed to study protein-protein interactions in N. crassa."
https://openalex.org/W2335654271,"The TRIB1 gene has been associated with multiple malignancies, plasma triglycerides and coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite the clinical significance of this pseudo-kinase, there is little information on the regulation of TRIB1. Previous studies reported TRIB1 mRNA to be unstable, hinting that TRIB1 might be subject to post-transcriptional regulation. This work explores TRIB1 regulation, focusing on its post-transcriptional aspects. In 3 distinct model systems (HEK293T, HeLa and arterial smooth muscle cells) TRIB1 was undetectable as assessed by western blot. Using recombinant TRIB1 as a proxy, we demonstrate TRIB1 to be highly unstable at the protein and RNA levels. By contrast, recombinant TRIB1 was stable in cellular extracts. Blocking proteasome function led to increased protein steady state levels but failed to rescue protein instability, demonstrating that the 2 processes are uncoupled. Unlike as shown for TRIB2, CUL1 and TRCPβ did not play a role in mediating TRIB1 instability although TRCPβ suppression increased TRIB1 expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that protein instability is independent of TRIB1 subcellular localization. Following the identification of TRIB1 nuclear localization signal, a cytosolic form was engineered. Despite being confined to the cytosol, TRIB1 remained unstable, suggesting that instability occurs at a stage that precedes its nuclear translocation and downstream nuclear function. These results uncover possible avenues of intervention to regulate TRIB1 function by identifying two distinct regulatory axes that control TRIB1 at the post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2314469115,"Duck populations are considered to be a reservoir of Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 in some agricultural production systems, as they are able to shed the virus for several days without clinical signs. Countries endemically affected with HPAI in Asia are characterised by production systems where ducks are fed on post-harvest spilled rice. During this scavenging process it is common for ducks to come into contact with other duck flocks or wild birds, thereby providing opportunities for virus spread. Effective risk management for HPAI has been significantly compromised by a limited understanding of management of moving duck flocks in these countries, despite of a small number of recent investigations. Here, for the first time, we described the management of moving duck flocks and the structure of the moving duck flock network in quantitative terms so that factors influencing the risk of HPAIV transmission can be identified. By following moving duck flock farmers over a period of 6 months in Java, Indonesia, we were able to describe the movement of flocks and to characterise the network of various types of actors associated with the production system. We used these data to estimate the basic reproductive number for HPAI virus spread. Our results suggest that focussing HPAI prevention measures on duck flocks alone will not be sufficient. Instead, the role of transporters of moving duck flocks, hatcheries and rice paddy owners, in the spread of the HPAI virus needs to be recognised."

Therefore, we determined the prevalence of MAP in patients with CD and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and its association with clinical course.Blood and intestinal biopsies were taken from 69 CD, 32 ITB patients and 41 patients with haemorrhoidal bleed who served as controls. qPCR targeting of MAP-specific IS900 gene was used to detect the presence of MAP DNA. qPCR results were further validated by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the presence of MAP antigen in biopsy specimens. CD and ITB patients were followed-up for disease course and response to therapy.The frequency of MAP-specific DNA in biopsies by qPCR was significantly higher in CD patients (23.2%, p = 0.03) as compared to controls (7.3%). No significant difference in intestinal MAP presence was observed between ITB patients (12.5%, p = 0.6) and controls (7.3%). MAP presence in blood of CD patients was 10.1% as compared to 4.9% in controls while no patients with ITB were found to be positive (p = 0.1). Using IHC for detection of MAP antigen, the prevalence of MAP in CD was 2.9%, 12.5% in ITB patients and 2.4% in controls. However, long-term follow-up of the patients revealed no significant associations between clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes with MAP positivity.We report significantly high prevalence of MAP in intestinal biopsies of CD patients. However, the presence of MAP does not affect the disease course and treatment outcomes in either CD or ITB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2313163279,"Background From April 6th 2015, all small shops in the UK were required to cover up tobacco products at point of sale (POS) to protect children from exposure. As part of a larger 5-year study to measure the impact of the legislation in Scotland, an audit was conducted to assess level and nature of compliance with the ban immediately following its introduction. Materials and Methods A discreet observational audit was conducted 7–14 days post implementation which took measures of physical changes made to cover products, server/assistant practices, tobacco signage and advertising, and communication of price information. The audit was conducted in all small retail outlets (n = 83) selling tobacco in four communities in Scotland selected to represent different levels of urbanisation and social deprivation. Data were analysed descriptively. Results Compliance with the legislation was high, with 98% of shops removing tobacco from permanent display and non-compliance was restricted almost entirely to minor contraventions. The refurbishment of shops with new or adapted tobacco storage units resulted in the removal of nearly all commercial brand messages and images from POS, dropping from 51% to 4%. The majority of shops stored their tobacco in public-facing storage units (81%). Most shops also displayed at least one generic tobacco message (88%). Conclusions Compliance with Scottish prohibitions on display of tobacco products in small retail outlets was high immediately after the legislation implementation date. However, although tobacco branding is no longer visible in retail outlets, tobacco storage units with generic tobacco messages are still prominent. This points towards a need to monitor how the space vacated by tobacco products is utilised and to better understand how the continuing presence of tobacco storage units influences people’s awareness and understanding of tobacco and smoking. Countries with existing POS bans and who are considering such bans should pay particular attention to regulations regarding the use of generic signage and where within the retail setting tobacco stocks can be stored."
https://openalex.org/W2323655682,"Understanding the mechanisms of uterine contractions during pregnancy is especially important in predicting the onset of labor and thus in forecasting preterm deliveries. Preterm birth can cause serious health problems in newborns, as well as large financial burdens to society. Various techniques such as electromyography (EMG) and magnetomyography (MMG) have been developed to quantify uterine contractions. However, no widely accepted method to predict labor based on electromagnetic measurement is available. Therefore, developing a biophysical model of EMG and MMG could help better understand uterine contractions, interpret real measurements, and detect labor. In this work, we propose a multiscale realistic model of uterine contractions during pregnancy. At the cellular level, building on bifurcation theory, we apply generalized FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations that produces both plateau-type and bursting-type action potentials. At the tissue level, we introduce a random fiber orientation model applicable to an arbitrary uterine shape. We also develop an analytical expression for the propagation speed of transmembrane potential. At the organ level, a realistic volume conductor geometry model is provided based on magnetic resonance images of a pregnant woman. To simulate the measurements from the SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA) device, we propose a sensor array model. Our model is able to reproduce the characteristics of action potentials. Additionally, we investigate the sensitivity of MMG to model configuration aspects such as volume geometry, fiber orientation, and pacemaker location. Our numerical results show that fiber orientation and pacemaker location are the key aspects that greatly affect the MMG as measured by the SARA device. We conclude that sphere is appropriate as an approximation of the volume geometry. The initial step towards validating the model against real MMG measurement is also presented. Our results show that the model is flexible to mimic the limited-propagation magnetic signature during the emergence and decay of a uterine contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2321459344,"Objective Tissue destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is predominantly mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby generating protein fragments. Previous studies have revealed that these fragments include MMP-mediated collagen type I, II, and III degradation, citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin and MMP degraded C-reactive protein. We evaluated if biomarkers measuring serum levels of specific sequences of the mentioned fragments would provide further information of diagnostic and/or prognostic processes in early arthritis. Methods Ninety-two early arthritis patients (arthritis duration<1 year, DMARD naïve) were enrolled. Patients either fulfilled the ACR/EULAR2010 criteria for RA (n = 60) or had unclassified arthritis (UA) (n = 32). Patients fulfilling the RA criteria after 2 years follow-up were classified into non-erosive (n = 25), or erosive disease (n = 13). Concentrations of the biomarkers: C1M, C2M, C3M, VICM and CRPM were measured in baseline serum. Results C1M, C3M and CRPM were able to discriminate between the UA and RA baseline diagnosis in 92 patients with an AUROC of 0.64 (95%CI 0.517 to 0.762), 0.73 (95%CI 0.622 to 0.838) and 0.68 (95%CI 0.570 to 0.795). C2M showed a potential for discrimination between non-erosive and erosive disease in 38 patients with an AUROC of 0.75 (95%CI 0.597 to 0.910). All of the applied biomarkers correlated with one or more of the disease activity parameters: DAS28, ESR, CRP, SJC66, TJC68 and/or HAQ. Conclusion This is the first study evaluating the applied biomarkers at this early stage of arthritis. C1M, C3M, CRPM might be the best diagnostic marker, whereas high levels of C2M indicated progression of disease at follow-up in early RA patients."

The P1/capsid region is related to the Sabin 2 strain, but sequences within the 5'-untranslated region and downstream of the P1 region were derived from recombination with other members of Human Enterovirus Species C (HEV-C). The two known attenuating mutations had reverted to wild-type (A481G in the 5'-UTR and Ile143Thr in VP1). The VDPV isolate had lost the temperature sensitive phenotype and had accumulated amino acid substitutions in neutralizing antigenic (NAg) sites 3a and 3b. The date of the initiating OPV dose, estimated from the number of synonymous substitutions in the capsid region, was approximately 8.5 years before seawater sampling, a finding consistent with a long time of virus replication and possible transmission among several individuals. Although no closely related type 2 VDPVs were detected in Brazil or elsewhere, this VDPV was found in an area with a mobile population, where conditions may favor both viral infection and spread. Environmental surveillance serves as an important tool for sensitive and early detection of circulating poliovirus in the final stages of global polio eradication."
https://openalex.org/W2324777811,"A recurring methodological problem in the evaluation of the predictive validity of selection methods is that the values of the criterion variable are available for selected applicants only. This so-called range restriction problem causes biased population estimates. Correction methods for direct and indirect range restriction scenarios have widely studied for continuous criterion variables but not for dichotomous ones. The few existing approaches are inapplicable because they do not consider the unknown base rate of success. Hence, there is a lack of scientific research on suitable correction methods and the systematic analysis of their accuracies in the cases of a naturally or artificially dichotomous criterion. We aim to overcome this deficiency by viewing the range restriction problem as a missing data mechanism. We used multiple imputation by chained equations to generate complete criterion data before estimating the predictive validity and the base rate of success. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the accuracy of the proposed correction in dependence of selection ratio, predictive validity, and base rate of success in an experimental design. In addition, we compared our proposed missing data approach with Thorndike's well-known correction formulas that have only been used in the case of continuous criterion variables so far. The results show that the missing data approach is more accurate in estimating the predictive validity than Thorndike's correction formulas. The accuracy of our proposed correction increases as the selection ratio and the correlation between predictor and criterion increase. Furthermore, the missing data approach provides a valid estimate of the unknown base rate of success. On the basis of our findings, we argue for the use of multiple imputation by chained equations in the evaluation of the predictive validity of selection methods when the criterion is dichotomous."
https://openalex.org/W2327530354,"Introduction Patients suffering from acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) with a decreased level of consciousness have been shown to have an improved clinical outcome if treated with an intracranial pressure (ICP) guided therapy. By using intracranial microdialysis (MD) to monitor cerebral metabolism in combination with serum samples of biomarkers indicating brain tissue injury, S100B and Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE), additional information might be provided. The aim of this study was to evaluate biomarkers in serum and MD parameters in patients with ABM. Methods From a prior study on patients (n = 52) with a confirmed ABM and impaired consciousness (GCS ≤ 9, or GCS = 10 combined with lumbar spinal opening pressure > 400 mmH2O), a subgroup of patients (n = 21) monitored with intracerebral MD and biomarkers was included in the present study. All patients were treated in the NICU with intracranial pressure (ICP) guided therapy. Serum biomarkers were obtained at admission and every 12 hours. The MD parameters glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glycerol were analyzed. Outcome was assessed at 12–55 months after discharge from hospital. Mann-Whitney U-Test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test were applied. Results The included patients had a mean GCS of 8 (range, 3–10) on admission and increased ICP (>20 mmHg) was observed in 62% (n = 13/21) of the patients. Patients with a lactate:pyruvate ratio (LPR) >40 (n = 9/21, 43%) had significantly higher peak levels of serum NSE (p = 0.03), with similar, although non-significant observations made in patients with high levels of glycerol (>500 μmol/L, p = 0.11) and those with a metabolic crisis (Glucose <0.8 mmol/L, LPR >25, p = 0.09). No associations between serum S100B and MD parameters were found. Furthermore, median MD glucose levels decreased significantly between day 1 (0–24h) and day 3 (48–72h) after admission to the NICU (p = 0.0001). No correlation between MD parameters or biomarkers and outcome was found. Conclusion In this observational cohort study, we were able to show that cerebral metabolism is frequently affected in patients with ABM. Furthermore, patients with high LPR (LPR>40) had significantly higher levels of NSE, suggesting ongoing deterioration in compromised cerebral tissue. However, the potential clinical impact of MD and biomarker monitoring in ABM patients will need to be further elaborated in larger clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2332980189,"Background Insecticide resistance in the housefly, Musca domestica, has been investigated for more than 60 years. It will enter a new era after the recent publication of the housefly genome and the development of multiple next generation sequencing technologies. The genetic background of the xenobiotic response can now be investigated in greater detail. Here, we investigate the 454-pyrosequencing transcriptome of the spinosad-resistant 791spin strain in relation to the housefly genome with focus on P450 genes. Results The de novo assembly of clean reads gave 35,834 contigs consisting of 21,780 sequences of the spinosad resistant strain. The 3,648 sequences were annotated with an enzyme code EC number and were mapped to 124 KEGG pathways with metabolic processes as most highly represented pathway. One hundred and twenty contigs were annotated as P450s covering 44 different P450 genes of housefly. Eight differentially expressed P450s genes were identified and investigated for SNPs, CpG islands and common regulatory motifs in promoter and coding regions. Functional annotation clustering of metabolic related genes and motif analysis of P450s revealed their association with epigenetic, transcription and gene expression related functions. The sequence variation analysis resulted in 12 SNPs and eight of them found in cyp6d1. There is variation in location, size and frequency of CpG islands and specific motifs were also identified in these P450s. Moreover, identified motifs were associated to GO terms and transcription factors using bioinformatic tools. Conclusion Transcriptome data of a spinosad resistant strain provide together with genome data fundamental support for future research to understand evolution of resistance in houseflies. Here, we report for the first time the SNPs, CpG islands and common regulatory motifs in differentially expressed P450s. Taken together our findings will serve as a stepping stone to advance understanding of the mechanism and role of P450s in xenobiotic detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W2314216850,"Objectives Kyrgyzstan is one of the 27 high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) burden countries listed by the WHO. In 2012, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) started a drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) project in Kara Suu District. A qualitative study was undertaken to understand the perception of TB and DR-TB in order to improve the effectiveness and acceptance of the MSF intervention and to support advocacy strategies for an ambulatory model of care. Methods This paper reports findings from 63 interviews with patients, caregivers, health care providers and members of communities. Data was analysed using a qualitative content analysis. Validation was ensured by triangulation and a ‘thick’ description of the research context, and by presenting deviant cases. Results Findings show that the general population interprets TB as the ‘lungs having a cold’ or as a ‘family disease’ rather than as an infectious illness. From their perspective, individuals facing poor living conditions are more likely to get TB than wealthier people. Vulnerable groups such as drug and alcohol users, homeless persons, ethnic minorities and young women face barriers in accessing health care. As also reported in other publications, TB is highly stigmatised and possible side effects of the long treatment course are seen as unbearable; therefore, people only turn to public health care quite late. Most patients prefer ambulatory treatment because of the much needed emotional support from their social environment, which positively impacts treatment concordance. Health care providers favour inpatient treatment only for a better monitoring of side effects. Health staff increasingly acknowledges the central role they play in supporting DR-TB patients, and the importance of assuming a more empathic attitude. Conclusions Health promotion activities should aim at improving knowledge on TB and DR-TB, reducing stigma, and fostering the inclusion of vulnerable populations. Health seeking delays and adherence problems will be countered by further implementation of shortened treatment regimens. An ambulatory model of care is proposed when convenient for the patient; hospitalisation is favoured only when seen as more appropriate for the respective individual."

The objective of this study is to identify non-invasive biomarkers that closely parallel renal pathology in LN. Previous reports have demonstrated that serum Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP-4) was increased in diabetic nephropathy in both animal models and patients. We proceeded to assess if IGFBP4 could be associated with LN. We performed ELISA using the serum of 86 patients with LN. Normal healthy adults (N = 23) and patients with other glomerular diseases (N = 20) served as controls. Compared to the healthy controls or other glomerular disease controls, serum IGFBP-4 levels were significantly higher in the patients with LN. Serum IGFBP-4 did not correlate well with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI), renal SLEDAI or proteinuria, but it did correlate with estimated glomerular filtration rate (R = 0.609, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, in 18 patients with proliferative LN whose blood samples were obtained at the time of renal biopsy, serum IGFBP-4 levels correlated strongly with the chronicity index of renal pathology (R = 0.713, P < 0.001).

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify factors associated with GLP-1RA initiation in primary care.Mean age (SD) of GLP-1RA users was 57.8 (11.8) years (males: 55.5%) and the average BMI was 36.1 (6.7) kg/m2. 22.8% were in diabetologist care and 12.0% had private health insurance. In multivariate regression, choice of GLP-1RA therapy instead of a different glucose-lowering drug class was associated with obesity (odds ratio: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.34-2.10), private health insurance (2.42; 1.89-3.09), younger age (0.94; 0.93-0.95 per year), male sex (0.85; 0.73-0.99), diabetologist care (2.11; 1.73-2.57), and geographic practice location (East vs. West-Germany; 1.25; 1.05-1.49). Among co-medication, angiotensin II antagonists (increased) and non-steroidal antirheumatic agents (decreased) were related to GLP-1RA prescriptions (both p<0.001).Consistent with German guidelines, GLP-1RA is mainly prescribed preferentially in T2D patients who are obese. GLP-1RA drugs were more frequently used than other options in privately health insured patients and in patients seeing a diabetologist."
https://openalex.org/W2306932694,"Endothelial dysfunction is considered to be an early event in atherosclerosis and plays a pivotal role in the development, progression and clinical complications of atherosclerosis. Previous studies have shown the beneficial effects of combined inhibition of thromboxane synthase and antagonism of thromboxane receptors by BM-573 on atherosclerosis; however our knowledge about the beneficial effects of BM-573 on endothelial function and increased blood pressure related to early stage of atherosclerosis is limited. In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term (3 μM, 1 hour) and chronic (10 mg/L, 8 weeks) treatments with BM-573 on vasodilatory function, nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, oxidative stress and systolic blood pressure in 15 weeks old apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-KO) mice. ApoE-KO mice showed a reduced endothelium-derived relaxation. In addition, NO bioavailability was reduced and oxidative stress and blood pressure were increased in ApoE-KO mice versus wild-type mice. BM-573 treatments were able to improve the relaxation profile in ApoE-KO mice. Short-term effects of BM-573 were mainly mediated by an increased phosphorylation of both eNOS and Akt, whereas BM-573 in vivo treatment also reduced oxidative stress and restored NO bioavailability. In addition, chronic administration of BM-573 reduced systolic blood pressure in ApoE-KO mice. In conclusion, pharmacological modulation of TxA2 biosynthesis and biological activities by dual TP antagonism/TxAS inhibition with BM-573, already known to prevent plaque formation, has the potential to correct vasodilatory dysfunction at the early stages of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2327895535,"Efficiency and fidelity are the key obstacles for genome editing toolboxes. In the present study, a PCR-based tandem repeat assisted genome editing (TRAGE) method with high efficiency and fidelity was developed. The design of TRAGE is based on the mechanism of repair of spontaneous double-strand breakage (DSB) via replication fork reactivation. First, cat-sacB cassette flanked by tandem repeat sequence was integrated into target site in chromosome assisted by Red enzymes. Then, for the excision of the cat-sacB cassette, only subculturing is needed. The developed method was successfully applied for seamlessly deleting, substituting and inserting targeted genes using PCR products. The effects of different manipulations including sucrose addition time, subculture times in LB with sucrose and stages of inoculation on the efficiency were investigated. With our recommended procedure, seamless excision of cat-sacB cassette can be realized in 48 h efficiently. We believe that the developed method has great potential for seamless genome editing in E. coli."

Inclusion. Type 2 diabetes/DN; Baseline creatinine clearance >30 mL/min; proteinuria ≥1.0 g/day; Age ≥30 years; BP <150/95 mm Hg; intolerant of/at maximum RAASi dose. Protocol. 3-wk screening; Baseline randomization; Urine and blood measures at months 1, 2, 4, and Month 6 study completion. Urine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and osteoprotegerin were measured in a subset. Primary outcome. Natural log of urine protein/creatinine (ln U P:Cr) ratio at Month 6 vs Baseline.30 patients completed the study. The 15% decline in U P: Cr in minocycline patients (6 month P:Cr ÷ Baseline P:Cr, 0.85 vs. 0.92) was not significant (p = 0.27). Creatinine clearance did not differ in the 2 groups. Urine IL-6:Cr (p = 0.03) and osteoprotegerin/Cr (p = 0.046) decrements were significant. Minocycline modified the relationship between urine IL-6 and proteinuria, suggesting a protective biological effect.Although the decline in U P:Cr in minocycline patients was not statistically significant, the significant differences in urine IL-6 and osteoprotegerin suggest that minocycline may confer cytoprotection in patients with DN, providing a rationale for further study.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01779089."
https://openalex.org/W2316969714,"Telecentric optical computed tomography (optical-CT) is a state-of-the-art method for visualizing and quantifying 3-dimensional dose distributions in radiochromic dosimeters. In this work a prototype telecentric system (DFOS—Duke Fresnel Optical-CT Scanner) is evaluated which incorporates two substantial design changes: the use of Fresnel lenses (reducing lens costs from $10-30K t0 $1-3K) and the use of a ‘solid tank’ (which reduces noise, and the volume of refractively matched fluid from 1ltr to 10cc). The efficacy of DFOS was evaluated by direct comparison against commissioned scanners in our lab. Measured dose distributions from all systems were compared against the predicted dose distributions from a commissioned treatment planning system (TPS). Three treatment plans were investigated including a simple four-field box treatment, a multiple small field delivery, and a complex IMRT treatment. Dosimeters were imaged within 2h post irradiation, using consistent scanning techniques (360 projections acquired at 1 degree intervals, reconstruction at 2mm). DFOS efficacy was evaluated through inspection of dose line-profiles, and 2D and 3D dose and gamma maps. DFOS/TPS gamma pass rates with 3%/3mm dose difference/distance-to-agreement criteria ranged from 89.3% to 92.2%, compared to from 95.6% to 99.0% obtained with the commissioned system. The 3D gamma pass rate between the commissioned system and DFOS was 98.2%. The typical noise rates in DFOS reconstructions were up to 3%, compared to under 2% for the commissioned system. In conclusion, while the introduction of a solid tank proved advantageous with regards to cost and convenience, further work is required to improve the image quality and dose reconstruction accuracy of the new DFOS optical-CT system."
