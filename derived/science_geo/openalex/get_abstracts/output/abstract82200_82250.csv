https://openalex.org/W1501072984,"Human platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and III are two major integral membrane components that have been identified as sites mediating thrombin-induced aggregation. For purposes of our study, glycoproteins IIb and III were solubilized by extracting platelet plasma membranes with a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and were separated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, employing Triton X-100-containing column buffers with or without urea or guanidine hydrochloride. The physical properties of the purified glycoproteins were: for glycoprotein IIb, Rs = 61 A, s20.w = 4.7, f/f0 = 1.7, Mr = 125,000 (hydrodynamic values), Mr = 136,000 (sodium dodecyl sulfate gels); for glycoprotein III, Rs = 67 A, s20,w = 3.2 f/f0 = 2.1, Mr = 93,000 (hydrodynamic values), Mr = 95,000 (sodium dodecyl sulfate gels). Although the amino acid compositions of the two glycoproteins were similar, antibodies raised against glycoprotein IIb did not crossreact with glycoprotein III. If divalent cations were not chelated in the Triton extract, glycoproteins IIb and III coeluted during gel filtration chromatography (apparent Stokes radius of 71 A) and co-sedimented on sucrose gradients (apparent s20.w of 8.6), from which Mr = 265,000 was calculated. Glycoproteins IIb and III were coprecipitated by an antibody monospecific for glycoprotein IIb. The two glycoproteins dissociated into monomers when EDTA was added to Triton lysates. Readdition of Ca2+ caused them to reassociate into a complex with physical properties similar to those of the complex in the original Triton lysate. The data show that glycoproteins IIb and III are a heterodimer complex, that complex formation depends upon the presence of Ca2+, and that chelation of Ca2+ causes dissociation into monomeric glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2155722817,"The two yeast mating-type alleles MATa and MATα each produce two mRNAs that are transcribed in opposite and diverging directions from central promoters. Silent copies of MATa (HMRa) and MATα (HMLα) contain identical DNA sequences throughout the transcribed region, yet are not transcribed, except in sir− strains. Since SIR represses not only transcription from a silent copy but also its ability to act as a recipient in a mating-type interconversion, we have investigated whether it might act by regulating the entire chromatin structure of a silent locus. We have therefore compared the profile of DNAase I and micrococcal nuclease cleavage at HMLα with MATα and HMRa with MATa in sir− and SIR+ strains. We find that SIR is necessary for the maintenance of a different chromatin structure at HM loci from their active counterparts at MAT. One particularly striking change that SIR induces provides a simple explanation for one of its biological properties: control of directionality of switching. SIR causes the disappearance of a DNAase I-hypersensitive site at Y-Z boundary (found at MAT or HM sir−) that is coincident with a double-strand cleavage possibly created by HO in the initiation of a mating-type switch."
https://openalex.org/W1574901107,"Rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase is rapidly inactivated at pH 8.0 by incubation with low concentrations of oxidized glutathione, Coenzyme A glutathione mixed disulfide, and oxidized Coenzyme A. The inactivation is first order in disulfide concentration over the concentration ranges examined (50-200 microM), and is approximately 8-fold slower at pH 7.0 than at pH 8.0. The substrates ATP and fructose 6-phosphate protect against inactivation while effector molecules such as AMP, cAMP, and citrate do not. The oxidation of the enzyme by disulfides is fully reversible. The equilibrium constant for the reaction Ered + GSSG in equilibrium Eox + GSH at pH 8.0 is 7.1 in the absence of substrates and 2.5 in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP. For comparison, the equilibrium constant for the reaction CoASH + GSSG in equilibrium CoASSG + GSH was found to be 3.1 at pH 8.0. These equilibrium constants for thiol/disulfide exchange are such that modulation of phosphofructokinase activity by thiol/disulfide exchange in vivo is feasible. The ability of the thiol/disulfide ratio in vivo to modulate the activity of the fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-diphosphate futile cycle is discussed. The possibility is considered that modulation of the thiol/disulfide ratio in vivo may serve as a third messenger in response to cAMP levels, and that the activity of key enzymes of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis may be regulated in response to changing thiol/disulfide ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1565489899,"Hen oviduct membranes are shown to catalyze the following enzyme reaction: GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6(GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-6)GlcNAc-Asn + UDP-GlcNAc leads to GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6(GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-4)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-6)GlcNAc-Asn + UDP. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction has been named UDP-GlcNAc:glycopeptide beta 4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GlcNAc-transferase III) to distinguish it from two other GlcNAc-transferases (I and II) present in hen oviduct and previously described in several mammalian tissues. GlcNAc-transferases I and II, respectively, attach GlcNAc in beta 1-2 linkage to the Man alpha 1-3 and Man alpha 1-6 arms of Asn-linked oligosaccharide cores. A specific assay for GlcNAc-transferase III was devised by using concanavalin A/Sepharose columns to separate the product of transferase III from other interfering radioactive glycopeptides formed in the reaction. The specific activity of GlcNAc-transferase III in hen oviduct membranes is about 5 nmol/mg of protein/h. Substrate specificity studies have shown that GlcNAc-transferase III requires both terminal beta 1-2-linked GlcNAc residues in its substrate for maximal activity. Removal of the GlcNAc residue on the Man alpha 1-6 arm reduces activity by at least 85% and removal of both GlcNAc residues reduces activity by at least 93%. Two large scale preparations of product were subjected to high resolution proton NMR spectroscopy to establish the incorporation by the enzyme of a GlcNAc in beta 1-4 linkage to the beta-linked Man. This GlcNAc residue is called a GlcNAc and appears to play important control functions in the synthesis of complex N-glycosyl oligosaccharides. Several enzymes in the biosynthetic scheme are unable to act on glycopeptide substrates containing a bisecting GlcNAc residue."
https://openalex.org/W1481421581,"The plasma membrane ATPase of plant cells has been postulated to operate as an electrogenic proton pump which derives the co-transport of nutrients with protons and which possibly catalyzes K+ transport (Poole, R. J. (1978) Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 29, 437-460). In addition, the enzyme seems to determine cell growth after hormonal stimulation by acidifying the external medium (Marre, E. (1979) Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 30, 273-288). In order to substantiate this important physiological role, the ATPase from oat root plasma membranes has been solubilized with a zwitterionic detergent and partially purified. A polypeptide of 93,000 daltons was enriched in the course of the purification. The enzyme was completely specific for ATP as substrate and it was inhibited by vanadate, diethylstilbestrol, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but not by oligomycin or ouabain. The ATPase activity was stimulated by K+ but this occurred only at acidic pH and the effect was less than 100%. After reconstitution of proteoliposomes by a freeze-thaw-sonication procedure, proton transport driven by ATP was demonstrated by the quenching of acridine dye fluorescence. Proton transport occurred in the absence of K+ and its electrogenic nature was demonstrated by the requirement for permeant ions (nitrate or K+ with valinomycin). It is suggested that the enzyme is an electrogenic proton pump, somewhat stimulated by K+, but not involved in the transport of this cation."

https://openalex.org/W1982871169,"A stoichiometric interaction of RecA protein with single-stranded DNA promotes homologous pairing of the single strand with duplex DNA and subsequent polar formation of a heteroduplex joint. Escherichia coli single-strand-binding (SSB) protein augments these reactions. Electron microscopic observations suggest structural bases for these interactions. Without triphosphates or DNA, RecA protein forms short linear filaments. With added circular single-stranded DNA, it forms extended circular filaments as well as collapsed and aggregated complexes of protein and DNA. The extended circular filaments are stiff and regular in appearance, contrasting with the convoluted structure formed by SSB protein and single-stranded DNA. Together, these two proteins form mixed filaments, which mostly resemble the extended structures containing RecA protein; moreover, SSB protein accelerates formation of extended filaments more than 50-fold, increasing the yield of these structures at the expense of heterogeneous aggregates. Other observations further define the interactions of RecA protein with partially single-stranded DNA, and the effects of ATPyS on the tendency of RecA protein to form polymeric structures even in the absence of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2101383627,"The chromatin structure adjacent to the Drosophila glue protein gene Sgs4 changes drastically when the gene is active. In nuclei from embryos or tissue culture cells in which Sgs4 is inactive, there are three DNAase 1-hypersensitive sites 3′ to the gene, but none near its 5′ end. In the nuclei of late third instar salivary glands, Sgs4 is actively transcribed, and a complex of five DNAase 1-hypersensitive sites appears 5′ to the gene. Two of the sites are near the point of transcription initiation, at −70 and +30. The others are much farther from the gene at −330, −405 and −480 and are affected by small deletions: one deletion reduces expression about 50-fold and removes sequences corresponding to the -330 hypersensitive site; another makes no Sgs4 RNA and removes sequences corresponding to two hypersensitive sites, −405 and −480. Thus the hypersensitive sites, or DNA sequences within 50 bp of them, seem to be required for normal gene expression. Distinct changes are seen in the chromatin from salivary glands of these mutant strains. The first strain is simply missing the −330 hypersensitive site, while the second is missing all of the tissue-specific 5′ sites, even though sequences corresponding to three of them remain. This suggests that hierarchical interactions among the regions 5′ to Sgs4 are required for its full expression. A sequence of 14 bp at the most prominent hypersensitive site (-405) is closely related to sequences 5′ to several other eucaryotic genes."
https://openalex.org/W1485382032,"This study asks whether nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication are supplied by distinct and separately regulated precursor pools. Using improved methodology for extraction and quantitation of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools from HeLa cells, we have confirmed and extended earlier findings of Bogenhagen and Clayton ((1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2938-2944). The four mitochondrial dNTP pools actually expanded following treatment with antimetabolites, even while total cellular pools of dTTP and dGTP are being severely depleted. Ribonucleoside triphosphates also accumulate in mitochondria after antimetabolite treatment. This confirms the idea of distinct regulatory mechanisms affecting precursor supplies for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial dNTP pools are larger, in relation to the cellular complement of mitochondrial DNA than are the whole cell pools in relation to the chromosomal DNA complement. Also, of the four dNTPs, the most sensitive to antimetabolite depletion is dGTP. This indicates that dGTP depletion may be more significant than previously realized as an element of the cytotoxic effects of methotrexate and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine."
https://openalex.org/W1565885119,"Extramitochondrial pools of mitochondrial precursor polypeptides can be detected in yeast spheroplasts which had been pulse-labeled for 3 min in the absence of inhibitors or for 10 min in the presence of an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. In either case, these precursors can be post-translationally converted to the mature forms during a subsequent chase. Post-translational maturation of the precursor to F1-ATPase beta-subunit is accompanied by uptake of the polypeptide into mitochondria. Pools of precursor polypeptides are also found in pulse-labeled intact yeast cells, the pool sizes depending on the metabolic status of the cells. For example, if the rate of protein synthesis is lowered by cycloheximide, the precursor pool size decreases. This indicates that living yeast cells can, and apparently do, import polypeptides into mitochondria post-translationally."
https://openalex.org/W2084084483,"A protein from mitotic cells of Ustilago maydis was purified on the basis of its ability to reanneal complementary single strands of DNA. The protein catalyzed the uptake of linear single strands by super-helical DNA, but only in reactions with homologous combinations of single-strand fragments and super-helical DNA from phages phi X174 and fd. No reaction occurred with heterologous combinations. The protein also efficiently paired circular single strands and linear duplex DNA molecules. The product was a joint molecule in which the circular single strand displaced one strand of the duplex. Efficient pairing depended upon ATP, and ATPase activity was found associated with the purified protein. ATP-dependent reannealing of complementary single strands was not detectable in the rec1 mutant of Ustilago, which is deranged in meiotic recombination, as complete tetrads are rare, and is defective in radiation-induced mitotic gene conversion."

https://openalex.org/W2034869266,"A low intake of dietary cadmium induces specific dose-dependent functional and biochemical changes in the cardiovascular tissues of rats. Maximum changes occur when the cadmium intake is 10 to 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. The changes reflect the accumulation of ""critical"" concentrations of cadmium in the cardiovascular tissues. The biologic activity of cadmium is demonstrated for intakes that approach those of the average American adult exposed to the usual environmental concentrations of the element but not to industrial concentrations. The sensitivity of the cardiovascular system to low doses of cadmium could not be anticipated by extrapolation from data on exposure to high concentrations of cadmium. The data support the hypothesis that ingested or inhaled environmental cadmium may contribute to essential hypertension in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1597088653,The methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) are integral membrane proteins that undergo reversible methylation during adaptation of bacterial cells to environmental attractants and repellents. The numerous methylated forms of each MCP are seen as a pattern of multiple bands on polyacrylamide gels. We have characterized the methylation sites in MCPI by analyzing methyl-accepting tryptic peptides. At least two different tryptic peptides accept methyl esters; one methyl-accepting peptide contains methionine and lysine and may be methylated a maximum of four times. The second methyl-accepting tryptic peptide contains arginine and may be methylated twice. Base-catalyzed demethylations of tryptic peptides and analysis of the charge differences between the different methylated forms of MCPI show that MCPI molecules may be methylated a total of six times. The two methyl esters on the methyl-accepting arginine peptide appear to be preferentially methylated in most of the forms of MCPI in attractant-stimulated cells. The ability to acquire six methylations on MCPI allows the bacterial cells to adapt to a broad range of attractant and repellent concentrations.
https://openalex.org/W1540688842,"Excision of the lambda prophage from the chromosome of its Escherichia coli host requires the products of the two viral genes int and xis. This paper reports a purification of the lambda xis gene product using a complementation assay in which functional Xis must be added to purified Int and an E. coli-derived host factor extract. Excisive recombination between a left (attL) and right (attR) prophage attachment site cloned on the same plasmid DNA substrate occurred efficiently under these conditions. Purified Int and Xis together could not carry out excision in vitro unless an extract derived from the E. coli host was added; purified integration host factor satisfied this requirement. Xis appears to have a molecular weight of 8800 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It possesses no detectable endonuclease or topoisomerase activities, does not appear to bind DNA to filters, and does not increase the ability of Int to bind DNA. The addition of Xis not only stimulated excisive recombination in vitro but also inhibited integrative recombination. Xis protected Int protein from heat inactivation, suggesting a possible interaction between the two proteins. In light of these observations, possible roles for Xis in recombination are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1481643814,"The ATP analogue 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) was used to study nucleotide site stoichiometry and interactions in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. The TNP absorption spectrum in the visible region undergoes a specific change upon binding of the nucleotide to SR ATPase. Equilibrium binding was therefore measured by differential spectrophotometry. In parallel experiments, TNP-[gamma-32P]ATP binding was measured directly by radioisotope distribution. The maximum number of nucleotide sites was estimated to be 8 nmol/mg of protein in SR vesicles. These binding sites can be separated into two distinct groups of different affinity. Accordingly, 10-100 microM ATP displaces a maximum of only 4 nmol of TNP-ATP/mg of protein from high affinity sites which are considered to be specific for enzyme catalysis. Free TNP-ATP in aqueous solution yields a weak fluorescence signal which is slightly increased upon binding of the analogue to SR ATPase. However, a pronounced fluorescence enhancement and a spectral change are observed when ATP is added in concentrations permitting partial occupancy of the specific sites by TNP-ATP. This effect is strictly dependent on ATP utilization by the SR ATPase, inasmuch as it requires Ca2+, and it is not produced by adenyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate. The fluorescence enhancement is reversible upon exhaustion of added ATP. It is concluded that TNP-ATP acts as a reporter of an ATPase conformational change following enzyme phosphorylation of the catalytic site by ATP, and that the observed conformational change is operative in the mechanism of calcium site translocation for active transport. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the bound analogue to the phosphorylation reaction is likely to be related to nucleotide regulation of enzyme turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1481883988,"CD spectroscopy on the double-stranded strictly alternating dinucleotide polymer (dT-dG)n . (dC-dA)n partially modified by N-acetoxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene suggests a left-handed conformation in concentrated NaCl solutions. Modification of the (dT-dG)n . (dC-dA)n polymer with acetylaminofluorene is required to promote formation of the left-handed helix since high salt concentrations and several other ionic conditions, which cause a similar transition for (dG-dC)n . (dG-dC)n, are ineffective. Furthermore, substitution of dC with 5-methyl dC in (dT-dG)n . (dC-dA)n does not facilitate formation of a left-handed helix, also in contrast to results found for (dG-dC)n . (dG-dC)n. A 62-base pair tract of almost perfectly alternating (dT-dG)n . (dC-dA)n from the 3'-side of the mouse kappa immunoglobulin gene modified with acetylaminofluorene undergoes the salt-induced transition to a left-handed helix when studied within a 140-base pair restriction fragment. High NaCl concentrations alone will not cause the transition for this 62-base pair tract in this fragment nor in the recombinant plasmid pRW777, which contains this fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1975997388,"Phage lambda gene Q encodes a positive regulator of phage late gene expression. We show that purified Q gene protein functions as a transcription antiterminator in vitro. It acts at the terminator for lambda 6S RNA, a small constitutive transcript that precedes the late genes, thus opening transcription into the entire late gene region. It is active in a purified transcription system consisting otherwise of only RNA polymerase, L factor and DNA containing the region encoding the 6S RNA. Q protein thus acts directly on the transcription complex to alter its response to transcription terminators."

https://openalex.org/W139279275,"The chromaffin granule ATPase mediates an inwardly directed transport of H+ against concentration gradients, thereby forming and maintaining an electrochemical transmembrane H+ gradient. The kinetics of this ATPase, its activity modulation by changes in electrochemical H+ gradients, and the stoichiometry between H+ transport and ATP hydrolysis were studied in intact bovine chromaffin granules, resealed chromaffin granule ghosts, and highly purified fragmented chromaffin granule membranes. In fragmented membranes the H+ ATPase has a KM for ATP of 69 microM, a maximum of activity at pH 7.3, and a Vmax of 111 nmol/min/mg of protein at 20 degrees C. Trimethyl tin inhibits the ATPase at much lower concentrations than dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, whereas oligomycin, reserpine, and other inhibitors were without effect. In intact chromaffin granules, the ATPase activity was stimulated up to 300% by collapsing the H+ transmembrane gradients. H+/ATP stoichiometry was measured in resealed chromaffin ghosts devoid of ATP and catecholamines under conditions where no net pH changes occur upon ATP hydrolysis. After addition of ATP, the rates of H+ accumulation in the ghosts and ATP hydrolysis were both linear for about 60-100 s, and the ratio of H+ to ATP was 1.71. These data indicate that the H+ ATPase of chromaffin granules has both kinetic similarities and dissimilarities with other known H+ ATPases. The regulation by changes in H+ gradients and the fixed H+/ATP ratio of this ATPase is further evidence of its primary role in establishing electrogenic H+ translocation and H+ gradients in chromaffin granules."

https://openalex.org/W1604255127,"The purification of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from bovine brain has been reported (Gospodarowicz, D., Bialecki, H., and Greenburg G. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 3736-3743). Further studies have shown that bovine brain fibroblast growth factor is composed of three fragments derived by limited proteolysis from myelin basic protein (Westall, F. C., Lennon, V. A., and Gospodarowicz, D. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 4675-4678). Two of these fragments (FGF-1 and -2) had a high specific mitogenic activity. In the presence study, we have used isoelectric focusing to purify brain FGF to homogeneity. The principal active components of brain FGF preparations partially purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 can be recovered in high yield from isoelectric focusing in sucrose. These components have a pI of 9.6 and 9.54, respectively. Their electrophoretic mobility, amino acid composition, and biological properties are identical with those previously reported for FGF-1 and -2."
https://openalex.org/W1577586137,"We have purified the phage lambda transcriptional activator protein cII. The procedure described allows cII to be obtained in both high purity and yield, and thus allows detailed physical and chemical analysis. We demonstrate that cII in solution is a tetrameric protein and that it undergoes specific processing at its NH2-terminal end. In addition, the protein is characterized as to its molar extinction coefficient, molecular weight, amino acid composition, isoelectric point, alpha-helical content, and antigenic capability."
https://openalex.org/W1707136818,"The ATPase of the plasma membrane isolated from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe catalyses a medium Pi in equilibrium H2O exchange in the presence of Mg2+ and in the absence of ATP and ADP. (formula, see text) The Pi in the E.Pi species tumbles in the active site so that each of its oxygens has an equal probability of exchange with water. The partition coefficient (Pc = k2/k2 + k-1) is 0.45. The total rate of oxygen exchange, Vex, representing the rate of incorporation of water oxygens occurring during hydrolysis of E--P into E.Pi (Vex = k-2[E--P]) is dependent on the [Pi] with an apparent Km of 177 mM, reflecting the very low affinity of the enzyme for Pi. The maximal exchange rate is 6.7 micrograms atoms of oxygen X min-1 X mg-1 of protein. The individual kinetic constants are evaluated: k2 = 3.4 X 10(3) min-1, k-2 = 5.50 X 10(5) min-1 and k-1 = 4.11 X 10(3) min-1. Under conditions of uncoupled transport, the hydrolysis of E--P is exergonic as [E.Pi]/[E--P] = k-2/k2 = 164. During hydrolysis of ATP, the rate of medium Pi in equilibrium H2O exchange activity as well as the extent of phosphorylation of the enzyme from Pi are markedly stimulated: 7.9 and 5.3 times, respectively, whereas the Pc is not modified. These data are most simply interpretated by the existence of two isomeric forms of the enzyme; one is specific for binding ATP and the other for binding Pi. The Pc for intermediate Pi in equilibrium H2O exchange, when the E--P species is formed from cleavage of [gamma-18O]ATP, is the same as for medium exchange, indicating that the same exchange pathway operates under both conditions. Varying the [ATP] had very little effect on the Pc, indicating little or no cooperativity between different catalytic sites under the conditions used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1598194566,"Pre-incubation of the plasma membrane [H+]-ATPase of Neurospora crassa with the sulfhydryl reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), leads to a marked inhibition of ATPase activity. Loss of activity depends upon preincubation pH and follows pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to NEM concentration. MgATP, the physiological substrate for ATPase activity, protects against NEM inactivation with an average dissociation constant of 1.5 mM at 0 degrees C. This value agrees well with the measured Km for MgATP hydrolysis (1.3 mM at 30 degrees C and 0.9 mM at 15 degrees C). MgADP also protects against NEM inhibition with an average KD of 0.18 mM at 0 degrees C; MgADP is a competitive inhibitor of enzyme activity, with a Ki of 0.08 mM at 30 degrees C and 0.09 mM at 15 degrees C. Free ATP and ADP, as well as other Mg nucleotides (MgGTP, MgCTP, and MgUTP) which are hydrolyzed at much slower rates than MgATP, exert smaller protective effects. These results suggest that nucleotides protect against NEM inhibition by binding to the catalytic site of the ATPase. NEM can therefore be used as a probe to study the nature of enzyme-ligand interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2064512733,"The mutability of DNA varies enormously from one base pair to another. Part of this variation is due to the specificity of the reaction between mutagen and base, but much of the variation is due to unknown causes. A genetic system developed by Miller and colleagues1 allows the mutation frequencies of a large number of different base pairs in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli to be compared. For example, Coulondre and Miller2 found that the sites most readily mutated by UV light are almost 100 times more often mutated than the least susceptible sites. A recently completed study3 of mutagenesis with neocarzinostatin (NCS) in the lacI gene has prompted us to re-examine some previous studies2,4,5 of mutagenesis in this gene. Our analysis, reported here, suggests that the mutations induced by certain mutagens fall into two classes: mutations in one class are clearly distributed non-randomly, that is, they are very common at some sites and significantly less common at others; mutations in the second class, however, occur at low frequency and appear to be randomly distributed. Both classes of mutations seem to occur only at damaged bases."
https://openalex.org/W1503174275,"Calmodulin from Neurospora crassa has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Equilibrium gel filtration experiments suggest that its Ca-binding properties are indistinguishable from those of vertebrate calmodulins. The isoelectric point of 4.04 and electrophoretic behavior under nondenaturing conditions indicate that N. crassa calmodulin is slightly less acidic than its vertebrate counterpart. The amino acid composition is typical of plant calmodulins with the exception that trimethyllysine is absent and that the content of Ser is unusually high. The tryptic peptide map of N. crassa calmodulin reveals an important number of point mutations as compared to vertebrate calmodulin. Differences in primary structure may explain why N. crassa calmodulin is less potent in the activation of myosin light chain kinase than calmodulins from higher organisms. The far UV circular dichroic spectra of the Ca-, Mg-, and metal-free forms of N. crassa calmodulin are similar to those of vertebrate calmodulin; in contrast, the near UV circular dichroic spectra are very different, apparently due to the differences in Tyr content. The single Tyr residue of N. crassa calmodulin, presumably located in position 138, undergoes an inversion of optical chirality upon addition of Ca2+, but not of Mg2+, to the metal-free protein."
https://openalex.org/W1600684795,"An antibody prepared against highly purified rabbit muscle Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum has been observed to cross-react with proteins in human platelet membrane vesicles. The antibody specifically precipitated Ca2+-ATPase activity from solubilized human platelet membranes and recognized two platelet polypeptides denatured in sodium dodecyl sulfate with Mr = 107,000 and 101,000. Ca2+-ATPase activity from Brij 78-solubilized platelet membranes was purified up to 10-fold. The purified preparation consisted mainly of two polypeptides with Mr approximately 100,000, and 40,000. The lower molecular weight protein appeared unrelated to Ca2+-ATPase activity. The Ca2+-ATPase in human platelet membrane vesicles exhibited negative cooperativity with respect to the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. The apparent Km for Ca2+ activation of ATPase activity was 0.1 microM. Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of platelet vesicles by [gamma-32P]ATP at 0 degrees C yielded a maximum of 0.2-0.4 nmol of PO4/mg of protein that was labile at pH 7.0 and 20 degrees C. This result suggests that only about 2-4% of the total protein in platelet membrane vesicles is the Ca2+-ATPase, which agrees with an estimate based on the specific activity of the Ca2+-ATPase in platelet membranes (20-50 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein at 30 degrees C). Calmodulin resulted in only a 1.6-fold stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity even after extensive washing of membranes with a calcium chelator or chlorpromazine. It is concluded that human platelets contain a Ca2+-ATPase immunochemically related to the Ca2+ pump from rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum and that the enzymatic characteristics and molecular weight of the platelet ATPase are quite similar to those of the muscle ATPase."

The component of pI 4.7, purified to or near homogeneity by isoelectric focusing shows a single peak of activity (Mr = 12,000) in gel chromatography and a single protein band of apparent Mr = 15,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Maximal restimulation of DNA synthesis initiation on serum-deprived 3T3 fibroblasts is achieved at 1-2 ng/ml; activity with rat glial cells (C6-3D) is less pronounced than with 3T3 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1599365448,"The relationship between calcium exchange across the membrane of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and phosphoenzyme (EP) was examined in calcium transport reactions using a limited amount of ATP as substrate. Rapid calcium influx and efflux (approximately 385 nmol.(mg.min)-1), measured in reactions in which ATP concentration fell from 20 microM, was accompanied by a shift in the equilibrium between an ADP-sensitive EP and an ADP-insensitive EP toward the former. Rapid exchange between ATP and ADP (approximately 1500 nmol.(mg.min)-1) was also observed under conditions where no significant incorporation of Pi into ATP took place, suggesting that ATP in equilibrium ADP exchange can occur without Cao in equilibrium Cai exchange. Ca2+ permeability during the calcium transport reaction was estimated in reactions carried out with acetylphosphate, which produces a hydrolytic product that does not participate in the backward reaction of the calcium pump. Under conditions where the calcium content exceeded 43 nmol.mg-1, a level that may reflect the binding of calcium ions to sites inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the rate constant for Ca2+ efflux was 0.33 min-1. These data allow the rate of passive Ca2+ efflux to be estimated as approximately 17 nmol.(mg.min)-1 at the time when calcium content was maximal and a rapid Cao in equilibrium Cai was observed. It is concluded that the majority of the rapid Ca2+ efflux is mediated by partial backward reactions of the calcium pump ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1527924822,"ATP-dependent calcium sequestration by rat liver microsomes has been analyzed by steady state isotope exchange. Liver microsomes display high affinity for Ca2+; the half-maximal concentration of free Ca2+ is 0.10 microM, and intravesicular steady state concentrations of 7-8 mM Ca2+ are achieved under optimal conditions. The uptake system displays multiphasic kinetics with respect to both Mg-ATP and free Mg2+, suggesting that microsomal preparations contain two distinct Ca2+-sequestering systems. Measurement of the kinetics of Ca2+ sequestration permits independent assessment of the activity of the calcium active transport system(s) and of the permeability of the membrane to Ca2+ backflux. Addition of ionophore A-23187 to microsomes renders them more permeable, and this is reflected in a more rapid equilibration of isotope. Conversely, low levels of free Ca2+ lead to a decreased rate of active transport, and this is reflected in a lower initial rate of isotope exchange. This system should be useful for investigating the mechanisms by which hormones, hepatotoxins, and other agents influence Ca2+ fluxes in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2041073996,"The nature of the binding of a high mobility group protein (HMG 17) to native and H1-H5-depleted chicken erythrocyte chromatin was studied, as a function of ionic strength, using circular dichroism and thermal denaturation techniques. The circular dichroism properties of the HMG 17-reconstituted whole chromatin and H1-H5-depleted chromatin demonstrated that a condensation of chromatin structure occurred upon HMG 17 binding at low ionic strength (1 mM Na phosphate, 0.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.0). Thermal denaturation profiles confirmed this change in the structure of chromatin induced by HMG 17. Thermal denaturation profiles were resolved into three-component transitions. In general, a shift in the temperature of maximum dh/dT for each transition (Tm) was observed for all transitions upon HMG 17 binding. DNA melting in the first transition, originating from linker regions of whole chromatin, was nearly totally depleted and was distributed mainly into the highest melting transition. The same trends were also observed in H1-H5-depleted chromatin. These results indicate that the binding sites of HMG 17 are situated in the linker regions immediately adjacent to the core. The nature of the interaction of HMG 17 at higher ionic strength (50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na phosphate, 0.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) with whole chromatin and H1-H5-depleted chromatin was found to be different but a decrease in [theta] values was found in both chromatins. These observations suggest that HMG 17 does not loosen chromatin structure but produces an overall stabilization and condensation of structure. The implications of these results to the currently accepted models of transcriptionally active chromatin are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1550408820,"6-Phosphogluconate activates phosphofructokinase in extracts of rat liver by decreasing both the apparent S0.5 for fructose 6-phosphate and the degree of cooperative binding of fructose 6-phosphate. There is no effect on the maximum velocity. Enzyme activity is a hyperbolic function of the concentration of 6-phosphogluconate, and the apparent Km is 60 microM. Thus, a substantial activation of the enzyme is achieved with a physiological concentration of 6-phosphogluconate (40 microM). Activation of phosphofructokinase by 6-phosphogluconate is influenced by a low molecular weight factor(s) in liver extracts. Part of the influence may be attributed to fructose 2,6-bisphosphate which, in some conditions, acts synergistically with 6-phosphogluconate to activate phosphofructokinase. In the presence of a mixture of ATP, ADP, and AMP at physiological concentrations, the effects of 6-phosphogluconate (40 and 200 microM) and a saturating concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (400 nM) are more nearly additive. This result suggests that 6-phosphogluconate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate act at different sites on the enzyme and that 6-phosphogluconate may contribute to the physiological regulation of hepatic phosphofructokinase. Regulation of phosphofructokinase by 6-phosphogluconate may provide a means by which the disposition of glucose 6-phosphate between the oxidative branch of the hexosemonophosphate pathway and glycolysis can be coordinated, an effect which may be important during hepatic lipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1525621807,"The functional unit of arom polyenzyme conjugate of Neurospora crassa was determined by analysis of radiation inactivation of each of the five activities in the conjugate. The functional targets for all five enzymes were in close agreement with the value of 300,000 obtained by conventional hydrodynamic procedure for the native dimeric structure. These data indicate that at least 95% of the functional enzyme system in crude extracts exists in a dimeric form and that both polypeptide chains of the homodimer are required for full activity of each of the five enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1594032915,"Hydrolysis of highly enriched [gamma-18O]ATP in unlabeled water by acto-heavy meromyosin at low actin concentration was found to be heterogeneous in that significant amounts of both the species containing 0 or 3 18O-labeled oxygens/phosphate were formed. Detailed quantitative comparison with theoretical distributions over a wide range of actin concentrations, however, indicated that the pathway which catalyzed ATP hydrolysis with a low extent of exchange only made a significant contribution at a low actin concentration and did not represent a major fraction of the total hydrolysis seen at higher actin concentrations. This low exchange component was also detected in the dependence on actin of the steady state ATPase. At low actin the steady state ATPase rate increased more rapidly as a function of actin concentration than predicted by the Km and Vmax for actin activation observed at moderate to high actin levels. This extra ATP hydrolysis at low actin correlates with that predicted for the low exchange pathway both with respect to the fraction of the ATP hydrolyzed and to its dependence on the actin concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1545939286,"Duck erythrocytes were incubated with the thiol-containing acetate analog 2-mercaptoacetate. The high mobility group proteins and histones were then extracted from the cell nuclei and the resultant protein mixtures subsequently were fractionated to their individual components by established procedures of selective trichloracetic acid precipitation and ion exchange and gel exclusion chromatography. The protein mixtures and the proteins derived from them were then subjected to mercury-affinity chromatography on organomercurial agarose columns, and it was found that significant amounts of all of the high mobility group proteins and core histones were bound by the columns. Furthermore, chymotryptic digestion of histone H4 from mercaptoacetate-treated cells and subsequent mercury-affinity chromatography revealed that the only peptides which bound to the column were the NH2-terminal peptides, the ones containing the lysines known to be the normal sites of in vivo acetylation. Carboxymethylation of mercaptoacetate-treated H4 with iodo[3H) acetate acid yielded 3H-labeled H4 and subsequent chymotryptic digestion showed that the only radioactive peptides were again those containing the lysines known to be the normal sites of enzymatic acetylation. These results and other biochemical evidence strongly indicate that the proteins of the histone and high mobility group classes which are known to be subject to postsynthetic acetyl transfer reactions can undergo postsynthetic mercaptoacetylation in vivo and that the sites of such modification are the same as those for normal acetylation. The phenomenon of mercaptoacetylation of chromosomal proteins affords a means for the selective recovery of newly modified protein molecules and their associated chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1566053834,"Conditions have been established which have led to the isolation of mononucleosomes which contain the high mobility group (HMG) proteins, in particular HMG 14, from mature chicken erythrocyte nuclei after extended micrococcal nuclease digestion. This selective enhancement of HMG-containing mononucleosomes appears to be due to their preferential solubilization at a time when other mononucleosomes, i.e. those containing H5 and H1 which represent the bulk of the mononucleosomes, were no longer soluble. Isolation of early mononucleosomes and subsequent analysis of these mononucleosomes after DNase I digestion showed that the DNA of these early mononucleosomes was more accessible to DNase I and that those mononucleosomes which contained HMG 14 were more soluble when the DNA became extensively degraded by DNase I. The resulting pattern of single-stranded DNA fragments suggests that the NH2 termini of the core histones no longer bind strongly to the nucleosomal DNA of the early mononucleosomes, and thus enhance the rate of DNase I digestion, while the presence of HMG 14 increased the solubility of these mononucleosomes. These two properties are probably the basis for the increased DNase I sensitivity of the transcriptionally active chromatin."
