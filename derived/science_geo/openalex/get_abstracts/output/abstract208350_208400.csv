https://openalex.org/W1994362757,"Deoxyribonucleic acid contains sequences complementary to homologous amino-acid transfer ribonucleic acid molecules which serve as the translating device between polyribonucleotides and proteins. This implies that the RNA molecules have their primary origin in DNA. From the amount of DNA participating, one would infer that more than 20 complementary sequences exist per genome, a conclusion consistent with a degenerate code. The fact that complex formation occurs most readily with homologous RNA suggests that, while the language remains universal, each dictionary is uniquely identifiable with its own genome."
https://openalex.org/W2345635555,"Evidence has been presented, in a preliminary communication from this laboratory (I), and by Schogt, Begemann, and Koster (2), to substantiate the previously postulated existence (3, 4) of nonphosphatide plasmalogens. This evidence was based mainly on observations made with unsaponifiable fractions obtained after treatment of neutral lipid with alkali. In our preliminary communication (I), for example, the neutral lipid of the digestive gland of the starfish (Asterius forbesi) was saponified. Fatty aldehyde was found to be released from the unsaponifiable fraction by mild acid treatment, and was detected with fuchsin. The color reaction used by Norton (5) to detect a&vinyl ethers’ of the phosphatide series (phosphatide plasmalogens) * Supported by grants from the American Heart Association and the Massachusetts Heart Association. 1 Since the discovery of the nature of the aldehydogenic linkage in the plasmalogens (6,7), these compounds have been referred to by many authors as &vinyl ethers of glycerol. This terminology could conceivably cause confusion in that the carbon atoms of the glycerol moiety are often referred to as LY, 8, and (Y’ in assignments of positions of attachment of various entities to the glycerol backbone."

https://openalex.org/W1979540059,"SOME ascitic tumour cells are coated with a mucopolysaccharide stainable by the Hale reaction1. Experiments were carried out to characterize more specifically the chemical nature of this cell coating and to study the dynamics of cell coat formation. Cells of ascitic mammary carcinoma TA3 were used in vitro. Experiments were carried out to determine whether some proteases and mucinases remove the cell coating, and, after removal, regeneration of the cell coating occurs."

This pattern consists of exaggerated sleep spindles, which are of higher voltage and more continuously present than in normal persons, and it correlates specifically with mental retardation and not with epilepsy or cerebral palsy."

https://openalex.org/W1992098312,"The cells of two hamster ependymomas, originally induced by intracerebral inoculation with simian virus 40 in newborn animals, have been serially cultured in vitro. None of the virus was detected in cell-free culture fluids or cell lysates. All cells retained their neoplastic potential when newborn hamsters were inoculated. Data suggest that viral nucleic acid is permanently present in some tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W4237877951,"ECTROMELIA, a highly infectious disease of mice, is caused by a pox virus closely related to the causal agents of variola and vaccinia. The disease is frequently found in laboratory mice, and its existence poses a difficult problem for those responsible for the supply of laboratory animals. It therefore seems worth while to record certain preliminary observations which may bear on the epidemiology of the disease."

Lever pressing was suppressed in the presence of a flashing light by (i) pairing the light with a brief electric shock (""anxiety"") and (ii) punishing the lever-pressing behavior with electric shocks."
https://openalex.org/W2087511789,The response to the second antigen of a sequence of two related antigens appears to consist of two qualitatively different antibody populations. Antibodies specific for the second antigen are of primary-response quality while the antibodies which cross-react with the first antigen are of secondary-response quality.

However, it caused substantial restoration of dieldrin- and DDT-susceptibility in Anopheles by increasing the frequency of homozygous susceptible phenotypes from 10 to 83 percent."

https://openalex.org/W1999131168,"IT is well known that the infusion of 0.1–1.0 µg/min adrenaline into the brachial artery in man results in an immediate transient increase in flow of blood in the forearm followed by a fall to below the resting level. Allen, Barcroft and Edholm1 showed that this biphasic response was not due to dilatation of muscle vessels followed by constriction of skin vessels. Finding that after dibenyline, adrenaline produces only a sustained vasodilatation, Ginsburg and Cobbold2 suggested that the action of adrenaline when given alone was due to an initial stimulation of inhibitory (β) receptors followed by stronger stimulation of excitatory (α) receptors. The action of adrenaline after dibenyline resembles that of iso-propylnoradrenaline. Recently we have found that after dichloroisopropylnoradrenaline, adrenaline causes only sustained vasoconstriction. and under these conditions resembles noradrenaline3."

https://openalex.org/W2047038733,"QUANTITATIVE hæmagglutination methods1 based on the enumeration of free or unagglutinated cells have given valuable information on the reactions of the antigens and antibodies of several blood-group systems2. These methods have had limited application, however, because of the tedium associated with visual counting techniques. To eliminate this objectionable feature, several investigators3 have used the model A Coulter electronic counter to measure hæmagglutination in terms of the numbers of total particles, that is, aggregates and free cells, present in an agglutinated sample. The degree of hæmagglutination is then generally expressed as the percentage reduction in the unagglutinated total cell count."

Compact primordial chick embryo cells show a sequence to RNA production as differentiation begins: First in the nucleus, then in the perinuclear area, then in the cytoplasm. RNA increases in the cytoplasm with cell growth and continues as the cells merge to form an epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W1986142018,"YAM (Dioscorea rotundata) is widely consumed in Ghana and other parts of West Africa and in some regions forms a staple of the diet. Toxic principles have been isolated from some species of yam, and it is widely known among farmers that the consumption of particular forms of yam may prove fatal1. Other species of yam when eaten in large quantities are said to lead to stupefaction2. It seemed desirable, therefore, to examine more closely the nutritional properties of those species of yam consumed commonly in Ghana."

https://openalex.org/W1964143781,"THE process by which acetylcholine causes muscle to contract presumably includes an action of acetylcholine on a definite site. The exact nature of this site, whether it is a small molecule, or a protein or enzyme, or a membrane, is still unknown. Although it is still inexactly defined, this substance or structure has acquired the presumably synonymous names ‘cholinergic receptor’ and ‘acetylcholine receptor’1,2. This communication offers evidence that the receptor structure of smooth muscle includes a chemical grouping capable of being acetylated, and that this acetylation process is a part of the chain of events that leads to contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1989327202,"SUMMERS1 in Southern Rhodesia has examined the distribution of prehistoric sites (that is, containing traces of ancient man), and the historic routes followed by invaders and pioneers since 1823, and concluded that there was throughout the whole prehistoric and historic periods “a marked aversion to Mopane woodland” (that is, deciduous woodland dominated by Colosphermum mopane and now occurring especially in the Zambezi and Limpopo valleys). He suggests that this aversion was because of the presence of the tsetse Glossina morsitans in mopane areas."

https://openalex.org/W1992960091,I HAVE read with interest the recent communication of Salminen1 on the effect of hydrogen ions on tho differential rates of migration of sodium and potassium ions. I believe this may relate to an experiment which I have performed demonstrating a differential effect of external magnetic fields on the concentration of those ions across a semipermeable membrane.
