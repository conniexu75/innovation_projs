https://openalex.org/W4241777701,"THERE are so many examples of the adaptation of an animal to its environment which at first sight would appear to find their simplest explanation in the supposition that the effects of the environment have become inherited, that theories of this kind have continued to retain a following in spite of the lack of clear experimental evidence in their support. This following has been composed mainly of naturalists; experimentalists and geneticists have recently tended to adopt an attitude similar to that expressed by Dobzhansky1, who writes: “This question has been discussed almost ad nauseam in the old biological literature … so that we may refrain from the discussion of it altogether”. In dismissing the matter so cavalierly, Dobzhansky was explicitly referring to “direct adaptation”, that is, the hypothesis that when the environment produces an alteration in the development of an animal, it simultaneously causes a change in its hereditary qualities such that the developmental alteration tends to be inherited. It has been usual, indeed, to consider this suggestion as the only possible alternative to the opposed view that environmental effects have no hereditary consequences, the phenomena of adaptation being solely due to the natural selection of chance variants."

https://openalex.org/W1986839035,"MICRO-INJECTION of certain strategic substances into the axon of the squid (Loligo pealii) has been carried out in order to study further the correlations between observed electrical activity of the nerve and possible neuro-chemical events. A micro-pipette with a long shaftlet having a lumen at the tip not more than 5 µ in diameter can be readily inserted into the giant axon between a pair of external electrodes. At will, it can be placed at the site of one electrode. These manœuvres can be accomplished without damage to excitation of, or propagation in, the fibre. The present communication is confined to reporting the blocking action of eserine and prostigmine, stilbamidine and curare, injected in aqueous solutions (usually containing 0.2 per cent phenol red, which colours the injection site an orange-yellow). Total fluid injected varied from about 10−4 mm.3 to 10 or 12 mm.3, usually, however, being of the order of 0.5–5 mm.3."

https://openalex.org/W1969909210,"Stokstad and Jukes1 reported that diets supplemented with aureomycin hydro chloride have a growth-stimulating effect. Since then, many reports have confirmed that a number of antibiotics may act as growth stimulants in pigs and poultry. It was of interest to see if nisim2, the antibiotic produced by Str. lactis, had a similar effect. The nisin used was not concentrated or purified, but was obtained by growing the cultures of Str. lactis in skim milk, when 100–200 units/ml. (c. 50 units = 1 µgm.) is always produced."

https://openalex.org/W2049262359,"IT has been known for some time that di-iso-fluorophosphonate and similar drugs, which are anti-cholinesterases in nature, in toxic doses produce syndromes resembling certain psychoses, and that in schizophrenics they aggravate signs and symptoms1. Conversely, it was thought that cholinesterase and other drugs counteracting acetylcholine should reduce the manifestations of schizophrenia, and they have done so, on injection into the cerebral ventricles of man2."

https://openalex.org/W2049339605,"I HAVE observed a case in which the young of one polychsete annelid, Arabella—probably A. iricolor (Montagu), the cosmopolitan species which is common to the Woods Hole area—parasitizes another polychaete, namely, Diopatra cuprea (Bosc). On August 24, I recovered fifty-three complete worms of the genus Arabella, and the parts of approximately ten others from one adult Diopatra. The segment from which the parasites were recovered was approximately one and a half inches in length. The Arabella ranged in size from small worms of approximately thirty segments without eyes or setse to large worms with four eyes (arranged in the transverse row typical for the genus) and with numerous segments (up to approximately 180), some of which contained setae. The largest parasite was approximately 5 cm. in length, as compared with the adult Arabella, which ranged in size from 50 cm. to 60 cm. in length1. The larger parasitic Arabella appeared to lie free in the cœlom, whereas the smaller ones were held in place by the small parietal blood vessels in the body-wall of Diopatra."

Our main conclusion, that a fibre repeat of 5.3–5.4 A. is in better agreement with the original Lotmar–Picken diagram than the value 5.65 A. given by Lotmar and Picken, was stated correctly and was deduced from the χ-values of the reflexions on the first layer line."

https://openalex.org/W2075536682,"IT has been found that very low concentrations (0.5 µgm./ml.) of methylene blue inhibit the growth in vitro of Bact. tularense. This inhibition is of the same order of magnitude as that caused by the most potent antibiotics1. The dye had, however, no effect in vivo; doses of 0.5 gm. each, applied intraperitoneally for three successive days, did not protect mice infected even with low doses (1–10 LD50) of the bacterium."

https://openalex.org/W2068503148,"IN the midbrain of the chicken embryo a close relationship has been demonstrated between aerobic glycolysis and cell division1, from which it can be inferred that growth is dependent on aerobic glycolysis. The rate of aerobic glycolysis has been measured in the retina of the chicken embryo by similar methods and the daily averages plotted (see accompanying graph). The rate of growth of the retina has not been measured directly, but the assumption has been made that it is approximately equal to the rate of growth of the eye. This has been measured in terms of its diameter, the rate of growth on any one day being expressed as the difference in the logarithmic value (in mm. to the base 10) on that day and the day preceding. Rates of growth so determined are plotted in the graph."

https://openalex.org/W1978451736,HUMAN serum is generally used as an antigen for the preparation of anti-human serum in precipitin tests. The use of human plasma does not seem to have had sufficient trials for this purpose. Johnson and Rawson1 concluded that plasma of some wild animals was unsatisfactory in the preparation of precipitin serum. We have not found any reference to human plasma being used as antigen in the literature available to us.
