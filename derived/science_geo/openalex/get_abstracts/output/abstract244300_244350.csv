Jones1 reported an unusually high nitrogen level (5.355 p.p.m., representing 50.8 pounds/acre/annum, 56.9 kg/hectare−1 per annum) and a high ratio of NH4–N to NO3–N (approximately 40 : 1) in Samaru (latitude 11.11° N, longitude 7.38° E) rainwater. Because an annual addition of nitrogen in such quantities to soils generally deficient in available nitrogen would be of great agricultural significance, we decided to check these figures. During 1969 rainwater was collected in open containers and analysed for NH4–N and NO3–N by steam distillation methods, as soon as possible after each shower. Table 1 gives the results on a monthly basis. For the whole year, the total addition of mineral nitrogen was found to be just over 4.5 kg/hectare−1 (4 pounds/acre). This figure is supported by additional data from an independent study for the 4 months from June to September, (i) At Samaru at this time the mean air concentration of NH3–N was 2.2 µm−3 (mean of 17 determinations; range 1.1–4.2 µm−3) and the mean rainwater NH4–N concentration was 0.18 p.p.m. The washout factor (personal communication from A. C. Chamberlain), w=(mg N+/l. of rainwater)/(mg N+/kg of air), of 80 calculated from these figures accords well with other values calculated from the literature2,3, (ii) Analyses of rainwater collected monthly at other stations in northern Nigeria revealed very similar total mineral nitrogen additions to that found for Samaru (Table 2)."

Its existence has, however, been disputed2,6. Attempts to find ways of making silica polywater, other than by the methods of Deryagin, have failed3."
https://openalex.org/W1964355415,"PROJECTING from the plane of the galaxy are three loops of nonthermal radio emission. Loop I, originally called the North Polar Spur, is 113° in diameter1 and is centred on lII = 330°; bII = 19.5°. The Cetus Arc, now called Loop II, is 92° in diameter2 and is centred at lII = 100; bII = −30°. Loop III is 71° in diameter3 and is centred near the north celestial pole at lII = 124°; bII = 11.5°. It was proposed in ref. 1 that Loop I is the remnant of a supernova close to the Sun, as the radio emission is non-thermal and seems to come from a shell source. If the radio loops are supernova remnants, then we would expect to observe filamentary nebulosity surrounding their radio ridges, as is observed in well known supernova remnants such as the Cygnus Loop."

https://openalex.org/W2051156105,"CHOMSKY1 asserted that, in the sentence “Learning that John had won the race surprised him”, the pronoun him cannot refer to John. Broadbent2 has cited evidence that English speakers do not reject this possibility when presented with the sentence in isolation. It seemed to me, however, that dealing with sentences in isolation is so very artificial as to be possibly misleading; though it is doubtless convenient for some purposes. In. general we perceive and understand sentences in the context of either longer passages or past experience (for example, in considering the sentence cited, we know that most winners of races are well aware that they have won without being told). The following paragraph was therefore constructed: “John is a very happy man this morning; though he was thoroughly miserable last night. He got home convinced that he had come second in the race and that Bill had won it. In fact, he was so sour about it that he could hardly bring himself to listen to the report on the radio. Learning that John had won the race surprised him. It delighted him, too.”"

https://openalex.org/W2010729084,"SJOGREN has reported that there is an annular negative gravity anomaly surrounding a small positive anomaly over the central basin of Mare Orientale (paper given at the NATO Advanced Study Institute on the Moon and Planets, Newcastle, April 1970). I should like to point out that outside this negative ring, there is a positive ring and perhaps further alternating rings. This outer positive ring contains as much apparent surface mass as the inner negative ring. The integrated mass anomaly associated with the Orientale region is very nearly equal to the central positive anomaly."

The import of this example2 is that there exists a hypothesis of higher likelihood than any statistical hypothesis one cares to contemplate, namely the determinist hypothesis which asserts that what was observed happened because there was no alternative, and hence has a likelihood of 1. Indeed, if the sample space is supposed continuous, this hypothesis has an infinite likelihood ratio in its favour."
