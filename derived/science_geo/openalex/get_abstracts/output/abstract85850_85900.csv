https://openalex.org/W2007331929,"A 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor macromolecule was detected in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes from normal humans. This macromolecule was found to be present in monocytes but absent from normal resting peripheral B and T lymphocytes. However, it was present in established lines of malignant B, T, and non-B, non-T human lymphocytes, as well as in T and B lymphocytes obtained from normal humans and activated in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1592463355,"Methods are described for the convenient preparation of aconitase from beef heart mitochondria in its inactive [3Fe-4S] form and largely in its active [4Fe-4S] form. Inactive aconitase can be activated anaerobically by various reducing agents without addition of iron. Under these conditions, maximally 70-80% of the activity attainable in the presence of added iron can be reached. It is concluded that during activation without added iron, [4Fe-4S] clusters are built from [3Fe-4S] clusters at the expense of a fraction of the 3Fe clusters present. This explains the approximately 75% maximal activation observed and concomitant loss of approximately 25% of total clusters as quantitated by EPR. Time course plots of aconitase activation appear to be second order but are not amenable to simple kinetic analysis because of the requirements of both reduction and Fe2+ for activation. Activation of aconitase with 59Fe leads to rapid (minutes) incorporation of 1 iron atom/cluster, which on subsequent inactivation is readily lost again. With longer incubation times (hour), 59Fe is found in more than a single site/cluster. It is concluded that, in analogy to cluster loss during activation in absence of added iron, the appearance of 59Fe in more than one cluster site can be due to complete breakdown and rebuilding of clusters. However, exchange into intact clusters cannot be ruled out. Ferric iron can be bound nonspecifically to active and inactive aconitase but can be readily removed by chelating agents. Sulfide is not required for activation of aconitase in keeping with the proposal that inactive aconitase, as isolated, contains a [3Fe-4S] cluster. It is demonstrated that oxidation initiates the inactivation of aconitase with concomitant release of iron and formation of 3Fe clusters as determined by EPR."
https://openalex.org/W1597332117,"Activation of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (G/F) of adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotides or by Al3+, Mg2+, and F-stabilizes the protein to thermal denaturation or to inactivation by LiBr, guanidine HCl, or urea. Such activation allows the resolution of the active 45,000-Da alpha subunit from the 35,000-Da beta subunit by a high performance gel filtration procedure. Separation of the active alpha subunit has allowed definitive evaluation of the subunit dissociation model for the activation of G/F. The resolved alpha subunit is sufficient to reconstitute the adenylate cyclase activity of the cyc-S49 cell mutant. The alpha subunit alone is also sufficient to activate a preparation of the catalyst of adenylate cyclase that had been resolved from all other identified components of the enzyme system. The resolved alpha subunit displays hydrodynamic properties characteristic of activated G/F. The alpha subunit contains a high affinity guanine nucleotide-binding site. Activation of G/F by guanine nucleotides or by Al3+ + Mg2+ + F- allows resolution of the activated alpha subunit. Reversal of the activated state of the resolved alpha subunit occurs only slowly. Addition of beta subunit enhances the rate of deactivation. Deactivation of the activated alpha subunit by the beta subunit changes the S20,w for G/F activity from 2.0 to 4.0 (in Lubrol), consistent with a formation of the alpha X beta heterodimer. These data, taken in aggregate, constitute proof for the proposed mechanism of activation of G/F by non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP and by Al3+, Mg2+, and F-. They are analogous to data obtained for transducin, the GTP-binding regulatory protein from vertebrate rod outer segment discs, and for the putative inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase (the substrate for islet-activating protein). The model provides several powerful tests for study of mechanisms of hormonal regulation of adenylate cyclase in membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2094413071,"Viruses have been found to induce inflammatory demyelinating lesions in central nervous system (CNS) tissue of both animal and man, either by natural infections or after vaccination1,2. At least two different pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed for these changes, a cytopathic viral infection of oligodendroglia cells with subsequent cell death, and a host immune reaction against virus and brain antigens. We now report the occurrence of cell-mediated immune reactions against basic myelin proteins in the course of coronavirus infections in Lewis rats. Infection of rats with the murine coronavirus JHM leads to demyelinating encephalomyelitis developing several weeks to months post-infection3–7. Lymphocytes from these diseased Lewis rats can be restimulated with basic myelin protein (BMP) and adoptive transfer of these cells leads to lesions resembling those of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in recipients, which can be accompanied by a mild clinical disease. This model demonstrates that a virus infection in CNS tissue is capable of initiating an autoimmune response which may be of pathogenic importance."

https://openalex.org/W1595771065,"The stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (G/F) of adenylate cyclase is activated by exposure to guanine nucleotide analogs or to Al3+ + F-. Activated G/F can reconstitute adenylate cyclase activity when mixed with the catalytic moiety of the enzyme system in the absence of an effective free concentration of stimulatory ligand. Activation is explained by dissociation of the alpha (45,000-Da) and beta (35,000-Da) subunits of G/F. The beta subunit of G/F facilitates reversal of the activated state of the regulatory protein. This phenomenon, which has been exploited as an assay for the resolved beta subunit, has the following properties. 1) Addition of the resolved beta subunit to fluoride-activated G/F increases the initial rate of deactivation from a t 1/2 of 10 min to less than 0.5 min. 2) The enhancement of the rate of deactivation is a saturable process with a K 1/2 value of 60 ng/ml (approximately 2 nM). 3) G/F does not display beta subunit activity unless the alpha subunit has been inactivated or the subunits have been resolved. beta Subunit activity is measurable in detergent extracts of rabbit liver membranes or plasma membranes from S49 cell clones. The activity in such extracts is similar to that found with purified G/F, in that incubation at 30 degrees C in the presence of Mg2+ is required for its expression. However, cyc-, UNC, and H21a (S49 cell mutants with deficient or altered G/F activity) have amounts of beta subunit activity similar to that found in wild type S49 cells. Furthermore, the amount of beta subunit activity exceeds by 5- to 10-fold the amount expected based on the quantity of G/F in wild type extracts. All of the beta subunit activity in detergent extracts of liver membranes can be purified as a 35,000-Da polypeptide that is indistinguishable from the beta subunit of G/F. The beta subunit activity in extracts of cyc- membranes is expressed after incubation with guanine nucleotide analogs, implying association of the beta subunit with a GTP-binding protein. By analysis of the chromatographic behavior of G/F and the recently identified 41,000/35,000-Da heterodimeric substrate for the islet-activating protein from Bordetella pertussis, we have identified the 41,000-Da subunit of the substrate for islet-activating protein as the GTP-binding protein with which the majority of the beta subunit activity associates. These data have direct bearing on the mechanisms of hormonal activation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1480001548,"The insulin receptor purified from human placenta by sequential affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin- and insulin-Sepharose to near homogeneity retained tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. This purified insulin receptor kinase specifically catalyzed the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into not only the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor but also histone H2B, a synthetic peptide which is sequentially similar to the site of tyrosine phosphorylation in pp60src (a gene product of the Rous sarcoma virus) and antibodies to pp60src present in the sera obtained from three rabbits bearing tumors induced by the Rous sarcoma virus. In each case, phosphorylation occurred exclusively on tyrosine residues. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of these substrates 3- to 5-fold. Kinetic analysis using the synthetic peptide indicated that insulin acted by increasing the Vmax of peptide phosphorylation from about 3.1 to 9.5 nmol X mg-1 of protein X min-1, whereas the value of the Km for the peptide, about 1.5 mM, was not significantly changed. This kinase acted weakly on casein, alpha-S-casein, actin, and a tyrosine-containing peptide analogue of a serine-containing peptide used commonly as a substrate for the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. These data show that the insulin receptor kinase displays specificity toward exogenous substrates similar to the substrate specificity observed for pp60src and the protein kinase activity associated with the receptor for epidermal growth factor. The data suggest that the catalytic sites of these three tyrosine kinases are similar and that insulin activates its receptor kinase by increasing the Vmax."
https://openalex.org/W1578114531,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalase activity in crude extracts obtained from wild type cells was activated about 3-fold by preincubation with cAMP and ATP. The inactive trehalase fractionated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography was activated by the addition of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase fraction from wild type cells in the presence of cAMP and ATP. Using the crude extract obtained from bcy1 mutant cells which were deficient in the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the stimulation of trehalase activity was observed in the absence of cAMP. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase of CYR3 mutant cells which had a high Ka value for cAMP in the phosphorylation reaction required a high cAMP concentration for activation of trehalase. Increased activation of partially purified inactive trehalase (Mr = 320,000) was observed to correlate with increased phosphorylation of a protein (Mr = 80,000) identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The assay results using various mutants altered in cAMP metabolism indicated that the activation and phosphorylation of inactive trehalase fractions depended on the cAMP concentration accumulated in mutant cells. Inactivation and dephosphorylation of active trehalase fractions were observed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase or crude cell extracts. The results indicated that the conversion of inactive form of trehalase to the active form is regulated by cAMP through cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1544860062,"It has been shown by spectroscopic (Kent, T. A., Dreyer, J-L., Kennedy, M.C., Huynh, B.H., Emptage, M.H., Beinert, H., and Munck, E. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 1096-1100) and chemical (Kennedy, M.C., Emptage, M.H., Dryer, J-L., and Beinert, H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11098-11105) methods that interconversion of [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters underlies activation and inactivation of aconitase. Since Fe-S clusters can assume different oxidation states, a number of different species of the enzyme can be expected to exist. Observations on activation-inactivation, as well as light absorption and EPR spectra, can be interpreted in terms of four species: [3Fe-4S]1+, the oxidized inactive enzyme as obtained on aerobic preparation from mitochondria; [3Fe-4S]0, the reduced inactive form as obtained on reduction in the presence of EDTA; [4Fe-4S]2+, the oxidized active form as obtained on reductive activation; and [4Fe-4S]1+, the reduced active form prepared by photoreduction of active aconitase. The light absorption spectra of each species are presented. Oxidized inactive aconitase shows EPR spectra typical of oxidized 3Fe clusters (g = 2.01), and reduced active enzyme shows spectra typical of reduced ferredoxins (g1,2,3 = 2.06, 1.93, 1.86). The EPR spectrum of the latter is drastically changed (g1,2,3 = 2.04, 1.85, 1.78) on addition of substrate. The active enzyme can be quantitatively converted to inactive enzyme by titration with ferricyanide in the presence of substrate. The correlation of EPR and optical spectra with enzymatic activity observed during titration demonstrates further that active aconitase requires an intact [4Fe-4S] cluster. A model of aconitase incorporating the four cluster species is presented, and explanations for some previous conflicting data concerning aconitase are offered."
https://openalex.org/W2042454817,"A striking paradox of the rapid eye movement periods of active sleep, which are typically characterized by the exacerbation of somatomotor atonia, is the occurrence of muscle twitches and jerks. The purpose of this study was to examine the specific motoneuron membrane potential processes responsible for these myoclonic patterns of activity. In lumbar motoneurons, examined intracellularly in the cat prepared for long-term study, these processes consisted of recurrent depolarizing membrane potential shifts and spontaneous action potentials that were either full-sized or of partial amplitude. In addition, the invasion of antidromically induced spikes into the soma was often blocked. Hyperpolarizing potentials were evident in the intervals between spontaneous spikes. Hyperpolarization was also observed immediately before depolarization and spike activity, in contrast to the gradual depolarization of the motoneuron membrane potential that always occurred during wakefulness. Thus, during rapid eye movement periods, in conjunction with muscle twitches and jerks, a strong excitatory input is superimposed on a background of inhibitory input. The unique patterns of membrane potential change that arise thus seem to result from the simultaneous coactivation of excitatory and inhibitory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1491480041,"Actions of maitotoxin, the most potent marine toxin known obtained from toxic dinoflagellate, Gambier-discus toxicus, were studied using clonal rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), rat liver mitochondria and liposomes. Maitotoxin induced a profound release of norepinephrine and dopamine from PC12 cells and the molar ratio of norepinephrine to dopamine was almost the same as that stored in the cells. This releasing action was apparent at a concentration of 5 X 10(-10) g/ml or more, the releasing rate increased with an increase in the concentration of applied maitotoxin and attained maximum at about 10(-6) g/ml. The [3H]norepinephrine release induced by maitotoxin was abolished in the absence of external Ca2+ and increased with increasing concentration of external Ca2+ up to 10 mM. The release gradually decreased as the external Na+ concentrations were reduced from 130 to 20 mM, but maitotoxin is still able to induce a profound release in the absence of external Na+. The releasing action of maitotoxin was markedly suppressed by various Ca2+ channel blockers, such as Mn2+, verapamil, and nicardipine, and by a local anesthetic, tetracaine. The inhibitory actions of Ca2+ channel blockers were antagonized by external Ca2+ and became less obvious in the higher Ca2+ concentration range. Maitotoxin did not exhibit any ionophoretic activities on rat mitochondrial and liposomal membranes. These results suggest that maitotoxin has the ability to activate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels of PC12 cells."

Monospecific polyclonal anti-human ASGP-R antibodies as well as anti-rat ASGP-R antibodies specifically inhibit binding of 125I-asialoorosomucoid to human hepatoma Hep G2 ASGP-R. These anti-ASGP-R antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate the 46,000-Da polypeptide from hepatoma cells labeled biosynthetically with 35S-amino acid. The receptor is initially synthesized as a 40,000-Da precursor which is converted to the mature 46,000-Da species with a t1/2 of approximately 45 min. The precursor species is sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and becomes resistant coincident with the appearance of the mature 46,000-Da receptor. In addition, the receptor synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin is approximately 34,000 Da. The newly synthesized ASGP-R reaches the cell surface after 45-60 min, where only the mature 46,000-Da species is present. In Hep G2 cells, the ASGP-R has a mean lifetime of approximately 30 h, a value which is unaltered during maximal rates of receptor-mediated endocytosis of ASGP."

https://openalex.org/W2078479559,"Sodium fluoride, guanylimidodiphosphate, and the D1 dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 elicited a greater activation of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of caudate nucleus in schizophrenic than in nonschizophrenic subjects used as controls. Similarly, a greater activation of adenylate cyclase by sodium fluoride was observed in the nucleus accumbens of schizophrenics. These findings suggest that the coupling of dopamine D1 recognition sites with adenylate cyclase is more efficient in the brain of the schizophrenic, presumably because of an increased affinity of the G/F protein for guanosine 5'-triphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1533252604,"The DNA polymerase induced after infection of Escherichia coli by bacteriophage T7 can exist in two forms. One distinguishing property of Form I, the elimination of nicks in double-stranded DNA templates, strongly suggests that this form of the polymerase catalyzes limited DNA synthesis at nicks, resulting in displacement of the downstream strand. In this paper, we document this reaction by a detailed characterization of the DNA product. DNA synthesis on circular, duplex DNA templates containing a single site-specific nick results in circular molecules bearing duplex branches. Analysis of newly synthesized DNA excised from the product shows that the majority of the branches are less than 500 base pairs in length and that they arise from a limited number of sites. The branches have fully base-paired termini but are attached by two noncomplementary DNA strands that have a combined length of less than 30 nucleotides. The product molecules are topologically constrained as a result of the duplex branch. DNA sequence analysis has provided an unequivocal structure of one such product molecule. We conclude that strand displacement synthesis catalyzed by Form I of T7 DNA polymerase is terminated by a template-switching reaction. We propose two distinct models for template-switching that we call primer relocation and rotational strand exchange. Strand displacement synthesis catalyzed by Form I of T7 DNA polymerase effectively converts T7 DNA circles that are held together by hydrogen bonds in their 160-nucleotide-long terminal redundancy to T7-length linear molecules. We suggest that strand displacement synthesis catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase is essential in vivo to the processing of a T7 DNA concatemer to mature T7 genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1570624812,"The binding of [3H]cGMP to purified beef lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cG kinase) was examined using two methods of membrane filtration which avoided loss of bound [3H]cGMP. The enzyme bound 1.6-2.0 mol of [3H]cGMP/mol of monomer. If the kinase was saturated with [3H]cGMP and then excess unlabeled cGMP was added, [3H]cGMP dissociated from the enzyme as two approximately equal components (Sites 1 and 2). When 8-bromo-cGMP or cIMP was added to the [3H]cGMP-binding reaction at a concentration sufficient to competitively inhibit binding by greater than 50%, the relative amount of the slower or faster component, respectively, of [3H]cGMP dissociation decreased during the cGMP chase. The data indicated that the cG kinase, like its cAMP-dependent protein kinase homologue, possesses two highly conserved intrachain cyclic nucleotide-binding sites which have different dissociation rates and analog specificity. The Ka of the kinase for cGMP was about 20-fold lower using histone instead of heptapeptide as substrate. Aging of the enzyme caused conversion to a higher Ka form of the kinase and an apparent increase in the Site 1 cGMP dissociation rate. Using fresh enzyme and heptapeptide as substrate, Site 1 occupation occurred at lower concentrations of cGMP than did Site 2 occupation, and was associated with an increase in protein kinase activity. However, kinase activity appeared to correlate better with total cGMP binding than with binding to either of the two sites, and the activation by cGMP exhibited positive cooperativity (n = 1.57). It is suggested that both intrachain sites are involved in protein kinase activation. E2 + 4 cGMP in equilibrium E2 . cGMP4 The cG kinase could be photoaffinity-labeled using 8-azido-[32P]cAMP.

The 90-kDa protein, tightly complexed with platelet actin, can be eluted from DNase I-agarose by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The platelet 90-kDa protein is immunologically related to rabbit macrophage gelsolin. The 90-kDa protein-actin complex was purified from platelet extracts using DEAE-Sephacel, Sephadex G-200, and hydroxyapatite and is stable in EGTA and 0.8 M KCl. The purified complex will modulate the assembly of fluorescently labeled 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole-actin in the presence of both Ca2+ and EGTA. In addition, the complex affects the low shear viscosity of F-actin solutions in the presence of both Ca2+ and EGTA. Finally, the complex increases the critical concentration for actin assembly about 4-fold. The results are consistent with a strong preferential binding to or capping of the barbed end of actin filaments by the complex in either Ca2+ or EGTA."
https://openalex.org/W1480135811,"In HTG2 hamster cells infected with the replication-defective Gazdar murine sarcoma virus only immature virus particles are formed, with the uncleaved gag precursor Pr65 as the only major protein in the virion. We have investigated the structure of these particles by using in situ cross-linking followed by chemical and enzymatic cleavages of Pr65 to localize sites of lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. Lipid-protein cross-links were localized within a 10-kDa fragment in the p15 region of Pr65. Homotypic protein-protein cross-links between Pr65 units were localized within the p15 regions and also within the p10 regions of Pr65. Similar data for processed gag proteins in Rauscher murine leukemia virus, a prototype of a mature C-type virus, suggest that these interactions of the gag precursor are not altered during maturation. To identify the sites of cross-linking within Pr65, we have developed a two-dimensional peptide mapping technique that is based on nearest neighbor analysis of fragments released by cyanogen bromide treatment of partial cleavage products in gel slices. In conjunction with cross-linking, the peptide mapping technique is a powerful means for localizing specific interactions on a polypeptide backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1596637835,"To assess the possibility that hydrolysis of the platelet surface thrombin substrate, glycoprotein V, is a necessary step in thrombin-induced platelet activation, thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycoprotein V was correlated with thrombin-induced platelet activation. Hydrolysis of tritium-labeled glycoprotein V on washed human platelets was measured by the appearance of a labeled supernatant fragment, and platelet activation was measured as secretion of ATP. Hydrolysis of glycoprotein V was linear with respect to both thrombin concentration and time of incubation. The extent of platelet activation was correlated with the rate of hydrolysis but not with the amount hydrolyzed. Maximum platelet activation could be obtained with thrombin treatments resulting in hydrolysis of as little as 4% of glycoprotein V per min. Glycoprotein V was partially removed from platelets by pretreatment with either platelet calcium-dependent protease or chymotrypsin. The rate of thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the remaining glycoprotein V from these pretreated platelets was as little as 1.5% the rate from control platelets, but there was no impairment of the extent of platelet activation. Thus, these protease-pretreated platelets compared with control platelets showed a different correlation of glycoprotein V hydrolysis with platelet activation. Glycoprotein V was also partially removed by pretreatment of prostacyclin-inhibited platelets with thrombin. After removal of thrombin and prostacyclin, these platelets were desensitized to subsequent activation by thrombin. Incubation of desensitized platelets with nonsaturating levels of thrombin led to less than 25% of the activation seen with control platelets but to a slightly greater hydrolysis of glycoprotein V. Thus, the desensitization to thrombin was not due to loss of ability of the activating thrombin to hydrolyze glycoprotein V. These results do not exclude a role for glycoprotein V as a component of the platelet thrombin receptor, but they indicate that there is no simple relationship between thrombin-induced hydrolysis of glycoprotein V and platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W2076782591,"Recently, we reported that adrenaline can stimulate the secretion of immunoreactive β-endorphin in the rat1. This response is mediated by β-adrenoceptors and requires circulating adrenaline concentrations which are known to occur during stress1–3. We therefore studied whether catecholamines are implicated in the stress-induced secretion of immunoreactive β-endorphin from the pituitary gland. We report here that in rat the β-adrenoceptor antagonist (−)propranolol reduces or abolishes the rapid increase of immunoreactive β-endorphin levels during some stress stimuli (footshock, passive avoidance, restraint) but not during others (ether, formalin, laparotomy). The propranolol-sensitive response is largely prevented by extirpation of the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland but is unaffected by dexamethasone, which inhibits peptide secretion from the corticotroph cells of the anterior lobe. These results suggest that catecholamines activate the release of immunoreactive β-endorphin from the intermediate lobe but not from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland during certain stress conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1655897070,"During net nucleoside triphosphate synthesis by chloroplast ATP synthase the extent of water oxygen incorporation into each nucleoside triphosphate released increases with decrease in ADP, GDP or IDP concentration. Likewise, during net ATP hydrolysis by the Mg2+-activated chloroplast ATPase, the extent of water oxygen incorporation into each Pi released increases as the ATP, GTP, or ITP concentration is decreased. However, the concentration ranges in which substrate modulation occurs differs with each nucleotide. Modulation of oxygen exchange during synthesis and hydrolysis of adenine nucleotides, as measured by variation in the extent of water oxygen incorporation into products, occurs below 250 microM. In contrast, guanosine and inosine nucleotides alter the extent of exchange at higher and much wider concentration ranges. Activation of the chloroplast ATPase by either heat or trypsin results in similar catalytic behavior as monitored by ATP modulation of oxygen exchanges during hydrolysis in the presence of Mg2+. More exchange capacity is evident with octylglucoside-activated enzyme at all ATP concentrations. High levels of tentoxin were also found to alter the catalytic exchange parameters resulting in continued water oxygen exchange into Pi released during hydrolysis at high ATP concentrations. Little or no oxygen exchange accompanies ATP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+. The [18O]Pi species formed from highly gamma-18O-labeled ATP at lower ATP concentrations gives a distribution as expected if only one catalytic pathway is operative at a given ATP concentration. This and other results support the concept of catalytic cooperativity between alternating sites as explanation for the modulation of oxygen exchange by nucleotide concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1532275854,"The cysteine residues of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II from porcine heart have been probed using alkylation with iodoacetic acid. Alkylation of the dissociated catalytic subunit resulted in loss of activity that was concomitant with the alkylation of both cysteine residues, Cys 199 and Cys 343. In contrast, no loss of activity was observed following alkylation of the holoenzyme. Isolation of the C-subunit following dissociation of the alkylated holoenzyme with cAMP revealed that Cys 343 was fully alkylated whereas Cys 199 was completely protected from chemical modification. These results establish that Cys 343 is not essential for enzymatic activity and, furthermore, indicate that aggregation of the C- and R-subunits selectively protects Cys 199. Alkylation of the R-subunit was also characterized both in the presence and absence of C-subunit. Cysteines 97, 124, and 326 were alkylated in R2 both in the presence and absence of cAMP. Of these 3 residues only Cys 97 was protected from alkylation in the holoenzyme. In the presence of high concentrations of iodoacetic acid, partial alkylation of the remaining 3 cysteine residues was observed, and this labeling was eliminated by cAMP suggesting that cAMP results in a general tightening of the protein conformation rather than the selective protection of any single cysteine residue."

The studies reported here show that the centers remain coupled in the one- and two-electron-reduced states of SiR. Exchange-coupling is also observed for the turnover complex, SiR X NO; this species can be prepared by reacting fully reduced SiR, which can function as a nitrite reductase, with nitrite. The coupling is also maintained in the presence of certain chaotropic agents. In SiR X NO, the exchange interactions between the S = 1/2 Fe(II) X siroheme X NO and the iron-sulfur cluster induce paramagnetism at the iron sites of the [4Fe-4S] cluster which is formally in the (diamagnetic) 2+ oxidation state. Analysis of the Mossbauer spectra shows that the iron sites of the cluster are equivalent in pairs, which are distinguishable by positive and negative magnetic hyperfine coupling constants. This study has revealed that the Mossbauer parameters of the siroheme, an Fe X isobacteriochlorin, are very similar to those observed for other hemes. The data obtained for the reduced forms of uncomplexed enzyme show that the siroheme iron is Fe(II), that it is paramagnetic, and possibly in the S = 1 intermediate spin state."
https://openalex.org/W1602084887,"Mossbauer studies of the hemoprotein subunit (SiR) of E. coli sulfite reductase have shown that the siroheme and the [4Fe-4S] cluster are exchange-coupled. Here we report Mossbauer studies of SiR complexed with either CO or CN- and of SiR in the presence of the chaotropic agent dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The spectra of one-electron-reduced SiR X CN show that all five iron atoms reside in a diamagnetic environment; the ferroheme X CN complex is low spin and the [4Fe-4S] cluster is in the 2+ oxidation state. Titration with ferricyanide affords a CN- complex of oxidized SiR in which the siroheme iron is low spin ferric, with the cluster remaining in the 2+ state. At low temperatures, paramagnetic hyperfine interactions are observed for the iron sites of the cluster, suggesting that it is exchange-coupled to the heme iron. Reduction of one-electron-reduced SiR X CN and SiR X CO yields complexes with = 1.94-type EPR signals showing that the second electron is accommodated by the iron-sulfur cluster. The fully reduced complexes yield well resolved Mossbauer spectra which were analyzed in the spin Hamiltonian formalism. The analysis shows that the cluster subsites are equivalent in pairs, one pair having properties reminiscent of ferric sites whereas the other pair has features more typical of ferrous sites. The Mossbauer spectra of oxidized SiR kept in 60% (v/v) Me2SO are virtually identical with those observed for SiR in standard buffer, implying that the coupling is maintained in the presence of the chaotrope. Fully reduced SiR displays an EPR signal with g values of g = 2.53, 2.29, and 2.07. In 60% Me2SO, this signal vanishes and a g = 1.94 signal develops; this transition is accompanied by a change in the spin state of the heme iron from S = 1 (or 2) to S = O."
https://openalex.org/W1508578483,"Formate dehydrogenase from Methanobacterium formicicum was examined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Although oxidized enzyme yielded no EPR signals over the temperature range 8-200 K, dithionite reduction resulted in generation of two paramagnetic components. The first, a nearly isotropic signal visible at temperatures below 200 K with g1 = 2.018, g2 = 2.003, and g3 = 1.994, exhibited nuclear hyperfine interaction with two equivalent protons (A1 = 0.45, A2 = 0.6, and A3 = 0.55 milliTeslas). EPR spectra of partially reduced 95Mo-enriched formate dehydrogenase exhibited additional 3-4 milliTeslas splittings, due to spin interaction with the 95Mo nucleus. Thus, this signal is due to a Mo center. This is the first reported example of a Mo center with gav greater than 2.0 in a biological system. The second species, a rhombic signal visible below 40 K with g values of g1 = 2.0465, g2 = 1.9482, and g3 = 1.9111 showed no hyperfine coupling and was assigned to reduced Fe/S. Both paramagnetic species could be detected in samples of M. formicicum whole cells anaerobically reduced with sodium formate. The Mo(V) signal was altered following addition of cyanide (g1 = 1.996, g2 = 1.988, and g3 = 1.980). Growth of bacteria in the presence of 1 mM WO4(2-) resulted in abolition of the Mo(V) EPR signal and formate dehydrogenase activity. Em, 7.7 was -330 mV for Mo(VI)/Mo(V) and -470 mV for Mo(V)/Mo(IV)."

https://openalex.org/W1590583683,"Cytochrome c synthetase has been solubilized from yeast mitochondria using Triton X-100 and fractionated with ammonium sulfate. Use of this partially purified enzyme has permitted us to isolate a quantity of iso-1-cytochrome c formed from 125I-labeled apocytochrome c and hemin in the presence of a NADPH-generating system. Visible absorption spectra (pH 8.0 or 5.0) including alpha, beta, and Soret bands and their molar absorption coefficients of this enzymatically synthesized cytochrome c in the oxidized and reduced states are the same, within experimental error, as those of native cytochrome c. Pyridine ferrohemochrome (pH 13) of the synthesized species also exhibits the same alpha and beta bands as those of iso-l-cytochrome c and similar to those reported for heme peptides of cytochrome c. If only one or no thioether bond were formed between the two vinyl side groups of heme and the cysteine residues of apocytochrome c, all these alpha and beta bands would have shifted to red (Pettigrew, G. W., Leaver, J. L., Meyer, T. E., and Ryle, T. E. (1975) Biochem J. 147, 291-302). Thus, two thioether bonds appear to be formed to link heme to apocytochrome c by cytochrome c synthetase, completing information of the three-dimensional structure of cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1540879490,"The reconstitution of the tetrameric enzyme yeast phosphoglycerate mutase after denaturation in guanidine hydrochloride has been studied. Denaturation is almost completely reversible at enzyme concentrations greater than 10 micrograms/ml. Cross-linking by glutaraldehyde has been used to monitor the reassociation of the subunits; the kinetics of this process has been analyzed in terms of a model involving an equilibrium between monomer and dimer followed by a bimolecular association of two dimers to give a tetramer. Reactivation is found to parallel the appearance of tetramer. Structural changes during reconstitution have been measured by circular dichroism and fluorescence. Both methods reveal complex kinetics indicating the rapid formation of structured monomers (half-time less than 10 s), followed by slow subunit association. For comparison, preliminary reconstitution experiments were performed on the dimeric phosphoglycerate mutase from rabbit muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2035089895,"In vitro binding studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple opiate receptor types. An additional site in the rat brain (termed the lambda site) is distinct from the established types by its selectivity for 4,5-epoxymorphinans (such as naloxone and morphine). While the lambda site displays a high affinity for naloxone in vivo and in vitro in fresh brain membrane homogenates, these sites rapidly convert in vitro to a state of low affinity. The regional distribution of the lambda site in the brain is strikingly different from that of the classic opiate receptor types."
https://openalex.org/W1599674510,"Analysis of glucagon and deshistidine glucagon binding to isolated canine hepatocytes and to hepatocyte membrane vesicles (formed by budding of hepatocytes in hypotonic medium) reveals two separate populations of hormone binding sites. Mathematical modeling further shows that the high affinity population represents 1% of the total in all four cases. Although calculated dissociation constants for hormone binding range from 0.2 to 400 nM, whether considering glucagon or deshistidine glucagon binding, or binding to the high affinity or low affinity receptor populations, receptor affinity increases 2- to 100-fold in the environment of the membrane vesicle; concomitant with this alteration in receptor affinity, receptor selectivity for the structure of the native hormone decreases 1.5- to 40-fold in hepatocyte-derived vesicles. Consideration of receptor affinity in relation to receptor number suggests that hepatocyte glucagon binding is distributed about equally between high and low affinity receptor populations at typical portal hormone levels. Nevertheless, consideration of receptor binding in relation to biological activity suggests that the activity of glucagon in inhibiting carbohydrate flux into glycogen is attributable to occupancy of the high affinity receptor population."

The 3' end points of the RNA, as shown by oligonucleotide analysis and S1 nuclease-mapping data, are clustered in the lac control region, within 70 nucleotides beyond the end of the repressor protein coding sequence. DNA fragments from this region, when inserted between the E. coli gal operon promoter and galactokinase (galK) gene, effect an 80% reduction in downstream galK expression. These results are indicative that sequences at the gene end function in vivo to terminate lacI gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1573095642,"Under steady state photophosphorylating conditions, each ATP synthase complex from spinach thylakoids contains, at a catalytic site, about one tightly bound ATP molecule that is rapidly labeled from medium 32Pi. The level of this bound [32P]ATP is markedly reduced upon de-energization of the spinach thylakoids. The reduction is biphasic, a rapid phase in which the [32P] ATP/synthase complex drops about 2-fold within 10 s, followed by a slow phase, kobs = 0.01/min. A decrease in the concentration of medium 32Pi to well below its apparent Km for photophosphorylation is required to decrease the amount of tightly bound ATP/synthase found just after de-energization and before the rapid phase of bound ATP disappearance. The [32P]ATP that remains bound after the rapid phase appears to be mostly at a catalytic site as demonstrated by a continued exchange of the oxygens of the bound ATP with water oxygens. This bound [32P]ATP does not exchange with medium Pi and is not removed by the presence of unlabeled ATP. The levels of tightly bound ADP and ATP arising from medium ADP were measured by a novel method based on use of [beta-32P]ADP. After photophosphorylation and within minutes after the rapid phase of bound ATP loss, the measured ratio of bound ADP to ATP was about 1.4 and the sum of bound ADP plus ATP was about 1/synthase. This ratio is smaller than that found about 1 h after de-energization. Hence, while ATP bound at catalytic sites disappears, bound ADP appears. The results suggest that during and after de-energization the bound ATP disappears from the catalytic site by hydrolysis to bound ADP and Pi with subsequent preferential release of Pi. These and related observations can be accommodated by the binding change mechanism for ATP synthase with participation of alternating catalytic sites and are consistent with a deactivated state arising from occupancy of one catalytic site on the synthase complex by an inhibitory ADP without presence of Pi."
https://openalex.org/W2025951860,"We have postulated that an excitatory postsynaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) may open voltage-sensitive K+ (‘M’) channels1, in an appropriate depolarizing range, and that this could alter the e.p.s.p. waveform. Consequently, the fast e.p.s.p. in neurones of sympathetic ganglia, elicited by a nicotinic action of acetylcholine (ACh)2, could be followed by a hyperpolarization, produced by the opening of M channels during the depolarizing e.p.s.p. and their subsequent slow closure (time constant∼150 ms)1. This introduces the concept that transmitter-induced p.s.ps may trigger voltage-sensitive conductances other than those initiating action potentials, and that in the present case this could produce a true post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization. (Some hyperpolarizations other than inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps) have been reported to follow e.p.s.ps3,4.) We show here that this is so."
https://openalex.org/W1558640221,"The activation energy (EA) and solvent-deuterium kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD) of human skin fibroblast collagenase were studied on the homologous human type I, II, and III collagens in both native and denatured states. Values for EA on human type I and II collagens in solution were 47,000 and 61,000 cal, respectively. The Arrhenius plot for type III collagen, unlike that for the other types, was characterized by a break in EA at approximately 26 degrees C. At temperatures below this point, EA was 42,500 cal; at higher temperatures, EA fell to 29,500 cal. This latter value, intermediate between type I collagen monomers and denatured random gelatin alpha chains, appears to result from a further opening in the already loosened helix of the type III collagen molecule in the region of the 3/4:1/4 collagenase cleavage site. The EA of trypsin on native human type III collagen was also measured and found to be 70,000 cal. This high value calls into question the role of serine proteases in the physiologic degradation of this substrate; a much higher energy expenditure was required for trypsin to cleave type III collagen than for the fibroblast collagenase. Reaction velocity on human collagen types I-III in solution was slowed 15-35% (kH/kD = 1.2-1.5) by the substitution of deuterium for hydrogen in the solvent buffer. This value was far lower than that observed following the aggregation of solution monomers into insoluble fibrils (kH/kD = 9). Denaturation of triple helical monomers into random gelatin alpha chains eliminated any slowing by deuterium, and kH/kD was 1.0 in all cases. Since the same peptide bond hydrolysis accompanies the cleavage of all these forms of the collagen substrate, it would appear that the role of water at the rate-limiting step of collagen degradation may not reside in the hydrolysis of a peptide bond per se, but rather may reflect the difficulty in transporting water molecules to the site of such catalysis, especially following fibril aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1575670084,Photolabile derivatives of D-Ala2-Leu5-enkephalin were prepared by synthetic procedures in which a 2-nitro-4-azidophenyl group is linked to the terminal carboxyl group of the enkephalin by means of an ethylenediamine or ethylenediamine beta-alanine spacer. These peptides bind to opiate receptors with nanomolar affinities and inhibit electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens and adenylate cyclase activity of NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cell membranes. Both inhibitions are reversed by the opiate antagonist naloxone. Photolysis of the ligands bound to rat brain membranes results in the loss of approximately 50% of the receptor sites. This decrease in receptor number is blocked by naloxone and requires light. A photolabile [3H]enkephalin derivative labels an equivalent number of sites under similar irradiation conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1617411819,"We report results of experiments designed to characterize the Type 1 and Type 3 copper sites in Rhus laccase depleted of Type 2 copper (T2D). Use of the Lowry method for determining protein concentration yielded the value 5620 +/- 570 M-1 cm-1 for the extinction of the 615-nm absorption band of this protein. Anaerobic reductive titrations with Ru(NH)3)6(2)+ and Cr(II)aq ions established the presence of three electron-accepting centers, which are reduced in a complex manner. Treatment of T2D laccase with a 70-fold excess of H2O2 induced a new shoulder at 330 nm (delta epsilon = 660 M-1 cm-1), as well as intensity perturbations at 280 and 615 nm. Comparison of difference spectra show that this 330-nm band derives from a Type 3 copper-bound peroxide and not from a reoxidized Type 3 site. Dioxygen reoxidation of ascorbate-reduced T2D laccase produced new difference bands at 330 nm (delta epsilon = 770 M-1 cm-1) and 270 nm (delta epsilon = 13,000 M-1 cm-1), the former assigned to a bound peroxide which is a dioxygen reduction intermediate. In the corresponding epr spectrum of this material new Cu(II) g parallel features (A parallel approximately 130 G) indicative of an isolated copper ion and a triplet signal near 3,400 G were observed, originating from the Type 3 sites of separate T2D laccase molecules. Reoxidation by ferricyanide or by dioxygen as mediated by iron hexacyanide did not produce these changes. Thus the magnetism of the reoxidized Type 3 site in T2D laccase can be perturbed as a consequence of aerobic turnover. The suggestion is advanced that there are presently three forms of T2D laccase, possibly metastable conformational isotypes, accounting for the apparently contradictory reports on the properties of this protein."

Additions of 25-500 microM triethyltin to red cell ghosts resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of ghost proteins. When added to partially purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases from red cell ghosts or bovine brain, stimulation of the phosphorylation of calf thymus histone was observed. The enhancement of kinase activity was due to release of catalytic subunits from the intact protein kinase. Brief exposure of the partially purified enzymes to triethyltin, followed by DE52 chromatography, resulted in elution profiles for regulatory and catalytic subunits that were similar to the profile resulting after cyclic AMP activation. Triethyltin interacts with both regulatory and catalytic subunits. When it was added to the partially purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases from human red cell ghosts or bovine brain, noncompetitive inhibition of cyclic AMP binding to the regulatory subunit of the enzyme was observed. It interacted with the catalytic subunit to produce slow inhibition of catalytic activity. The inhibition was non-competitive with respect to both histone and ATP. When intact red cells were subjected to brief exposure with triethyltin, enhanced phosphorylation of certain membrane proteins occurred, suggesting that the activation of the cyclic AMP protein kinases by triethyltin may be physiologically significant."

https://openalex.org/W1605001968,"Solution measurements of the overall shape, secondary structure, and tryptophan fluorescence of Euglena gracilis ferricytochrome c558 at neutral pH and 25 degrees C indicate that the conformation of the native protein is very comparable to that of horse heart ferricytochrome c550. The increased susceptibility of the Euglena ferricytochrome c to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride at neutral pH relative to the horse protein can be accounted for by the differences in their amino acid sequences. The kinetics of refolding of acid and guanidine denatured Euglena ferricytochrome c are similar to those observed with the horse protein with respect to the numbers of kinetic phases detected and to the fractional reaction associated with each phase. The time constants of the kinetic phases observed in the refolding of guanidine denatured Euglena ferricytochrome c are those predicted from the midpoint of the denaturation transition measured at equilibrium. Thus, the absence of one thioether bridge linking the heme with the polypeptide chain in Euglena cytochrome c does not appear to significantly perturb either the acquisition or the stability of the native conformation. The enhanced flexibility of the heme in denatured Euglena ferricytochrome c likely contributes to the extensive quenching of its tryptophan fluorescence and to its polymerization in acid media containing concentrated salt."
