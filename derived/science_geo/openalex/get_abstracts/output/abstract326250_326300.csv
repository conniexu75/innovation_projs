https://openalex.org/W2088101847,"The case is made that the spin-liquid state of a Mott insulator, hypothesized to exist by Anderson and identified by him as the correct context for discussing high-temperature superconductors, occurs in these materials and exhibits the principles of fractional quantization identified in the fractional quantum Hall effect. The most important of these is that particles carrying a fraction of an elementary quantum number, in this case spin, attract one another by a powerful gauge force, which can lead to a new kind of superconductivity. The temperature scale for the superconductivity is set by an energy gap in the spin-wave spectrum, which is also the fundamental measure of how ""liquid"" the spins are."
https://openalex.org/W2067721483,"Observations at Thule, Greenland, that made use of direct light from the moon on 2,3, 4,5, and 7 February 1988 revealed nighttime chlorine dioxide (OClO) abundances that were less than those obtained in Antarctica by about a factor of 5, but that exceeded model predictions based on homogeneous (gas-phase) photochemistry by about a factor of 10. The observed time scale for the formation of OClO after sunset strongly supports the current understanding of the diurnal chemistry of OClO. These data suggest that heterogeneous (surface) reactions due to polar stratospheric clouds can occur in the Arctic, providing a mechanism for possible Arctic ozone depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1999249193,"In order to test photochemical theories linking chlorofluorocarbon derivatives to ozone(O(3)) depletion at high latitudes in the springtime, several related atmospheric species, including O(3), chlorine monoxide(ClO), and bromine monoxide (BrO) were measured in the lower stratosphere with instruments mounted on the NASA ER-2 aircraft on 13 February 1988. The flight path from Moffett Field, California (37 degrees N, 121 degrees W), to Great Slave Lake, Canada (61 degrees N, 115 degrees W), extended to the center of the polar jet associated with but outside of the Arctic vortex, in which the abundance of O(3) was twice its mid-latitude value, whereas BrO levels were 5 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) between 18 and 21 kilometers, and 2.4 pptv below that altitude. The ClO mixing ratio was as much as 65 pptv at 60 degrees N latitude at an altitude of 20 kilometers, and was enhanced over mid-latitude values by a factor of 3 to 5 at altitudes above 18 kilometers and by as much as a factor of 40 at altitudes below 17 kilometers. Levels of ClO and O(3) were highly correlated on all measured distance scales, and both showed an abrupt change in character at 54 degrees N latitude. The enhancement of ClO abundance north of 54 degrees N was most likely caused by low nitrogen dioxide levels in the flight path."
https://openalex.org/W2061610049,"Estimates can be made of unseen mass (in the form of cometary nuclei) at the heliocentric distances between 3 x 10(3) and 2 x 10(4) astronomical units(AU) under the assumptions (i) that the Oort cloud is a rarefied halo surrounding the core (dense, inner cometary cloud) and (ii) that the mass and albedo of comet Halley is typical for comets both in the core and the Oort cloud populations. The mass appears to be approximately 0.03 solar masses, with angular momentum of the order of 10(52) to 10(53) g-cm(2)/s. This mass is of the order of the total mass of the planetary system before the loss of volatiles. This leads to an estimate of a mass M(o) approximately 100 M( plus sign in circle) (where M( plus sign in circle) is the mass of Earth) concentrated in the Oort cloud (r > 2 x 10(4) AU) with an angular momentum that may exceed the present angular momentum of the whole planetary system by one order of magnitude. The present angular momentum of the Oort cloud appears to be of the same order as the total angular momentum of the planetary system before the loss of volatiles."
https://openalex.org/W2002268653,"Scattered sunlight and direct light from the moon was used in two wavelength ranges to measure the total column abundances of stratospheric ozone(O(3)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) at Thule, Greenland (76.5 degrees N), during the period from 29 January to 16 February 1988. The observed O(3) column varied between about 325 and 400 Dobson units, and the lower values were observed when the center of the Arctic polar vortex was closest to Thule. This gradient probably indicates that O(3) levels decrease due to dynamical processes near the center of the Arctic vortex and should be considered in attempts to derive trends in O(3) levels. The observed NO(2) levels were also lowest in the center of the Arctic vortex and were sometimes as low as 5 x 10(14) molecules per square centimeter, which is even less than comparable values measured during Antarctic spring, suggesting that significant heterogeneous photochemistry takes place during the Arctic winter as it does in the Antarctic."
