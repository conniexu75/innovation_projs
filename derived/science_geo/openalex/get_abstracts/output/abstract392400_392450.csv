https://openalex.org/W2163404991,"Genomic stability is critical for the clinical use of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. We performed high-resolution SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) analysis on 186 pluripotent and 119 nonpluripotent samples. We report a higher frequency of subchromosomal copy number variations in pluripotent samples compared to nonpluripotent samples, with variations enriched in specific genomic regions. The distribution of these variations differed between hESCs and hiPSCs, characterized by large numbers of duplications found in a few hESC samples and moderate numbers of deletions distributed across many hiPSC samples. For hiPSCs, the reprogramming process was associated with deletions of tumor-suppressor genes, whereas time in culture was associated with duplications of oncogenic genes. We also observed duplications that arose during a differentiation protocol. Our results illustrate the dynamic nature of genomic abnormalities in pluripotent stem cells and the need for frequent genomic monitoring to assure phenotypic stability and clinical safety."
https://openalex.org/W1995168386,"The majority of research on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has focused on their cellular toxicities. Stem cells generally have been thought to maintain low levels of ROS as a protection against these processes. However, recent studies suggest that ROS can also play roles as second messengers, activating normal cellular processes. Here, we investigated ROS function in primary brain-derived neural progenitors. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that proliferative, self-renewing multipotent neural progenitors with the phenotypic characteristics of neural stem cells (NSC) maintained a high ROS status and were highly responsive to ROS stimulation. ROS-mediated enhancements in self-renewal and neurogenesis were dependent on PI3K/Akt signaling. Pharmacological or genetic manipulations that diminished cellular ROS levels also interfered with normal NSC and/or multipotent progenitor function both in vitro and in vivo. This study has identified a redox-mediated regulatory mechanism of NSC function that may have significant implications for brain injury, disease, and repair."

https://openalex.org/W2151522898,"Despite rapid progress in characterizing transcription factor-driven reprogramming of somatic cells to an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) state, many mechanistic questions still remain. To gain insight into the earliest events in the reprogramming process, we systematically analyzed the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that occur during early factor induction after discrete numbers of divisions. We observed rapid, genome-wide changes in the euchromatic histone modification, H3K4me2, at more than a thousand loci including large subsets of pluripotency-related or developmentally regulated gene promoters and enhancers. In contrast, patterns of the repressive H3K27me3 modification remained largely unchanged except for focused depletion specifically at positions where H3K4 methylation is gained. These chromatin regulatory events precede transcriptional changes within the corresponding loci. Our data provide evidence for an early, organized, and population-wide epigenetic response to ectopic reprogramming factors that clarify the temporal order through which somatic identity is reset during reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2114693507,"A young and energetic pulsar powers the well-known Crab Nebula. Here we describe two separate gamma-ray (photon energy >100 MeV) flares from this source detected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The first flare occurred in February 2009 and lasted approximately 16 days. The second flare was detected in September 2010 and lasted approximately 4 days. During these outbursts the gamma-ray flux from the nebula increased by factors of four and six, respectively. The brevity of the flares implies that the gamma rays were emitted via synchrotron radiation from PeV (10^15 eV) electrons in a region smaller than 1.4 10^-2 pc. These are the highest energy particles that can be associated with a discrete astronomical source, and they pose challenges to particle acceleration theory."
https://openalex.org/W2166001339,"Multimorbidity is a common problem in the elderly that is significantly associated with higher mortality, increased disability and functional decline. Information about interactions of chronic diseases can help to facilitate diagnosis, amend prevention and enhance the patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to increase the knowledge of specific processes of multimorbidity in an unselected elderly population by identifying patterns of statistically significantly associated comorbidity.Multimorbidity patterns were identified by exploratory tetrachoric factor analysis based on claims data of 63,104 males and 86,176 females in the age group 65+. Analyses were based on 46 diagnosis groups incorporating all ICD-10 diagnoses of chronic diseases with a prevalence ≥ 1%. Both genders were analyzed separately. Persons were assigned to multimorbidity patterns if they had at least three diagnosis groups with a factor loading of 0.25 on the corresponding pattern.Three multimorbidity patterns were found: 1) cardiovascular/metabolic disorders [prevalence female: 30%; male: 39%], 2) anxiety/depression/somatoform disorders and pain [34%; 22%], and 3) neuropsychiatric disorders [6%; 0.8%]. The sampling adequacy was meritorious (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure: 0.85 and 0.84, respectively) and the factors explained a large part of the variance (cumulative percent: 78% and 75%, respectively). The patterns were largely age-dependent and overlapped in a sizeable part of the population. Altogether 50% of female and 48% of male persons were assigned to at least one of the three multimorbidity patterns.This study shows that statistically significant co-occurrence of chronic diseases can be subsumed in three prevalent multimorbidity patterns if accounting for the fact that different multimorbidity patterns share some diagnosis groups, influence each other and overlap in a large part of the population. In recognizing the full complexity of multimorbidity we might improve our ability to predict needs and achieve possible benefits for elderly patients who suffer from multimorbidity."

https://openalex.org/W1995701551,"Specific bone marrow (BM) niches are critical for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function during both normal hematopoiesis and in stem cell transplantation therapy. We demonstrate that the guidance molecule Robo4 functions to specifically anchor HSCs to BM niches. Robo4-deficient HSCs displayed poor localization to BM niches and drastically reduced long-term reconstitution capability while retaining multilineage potential. Cxcr4, a critical regulator of HSC location, is upregulated in Robo4(-/-) HSCs to compensate for Robo4 loss. Robo4 deletion led to altered HSC mobilization efficiency, revealing that inhibition of both Cxcr4- and Robo4-mediated niche interactions are necessary for efficient HSC mobilization. Surprisingly, we found that WT HSCs express very low levels of Cxcr4 and respond poorly to Cxcr4 manipulation relative to other hematopoietic cells. We conclude that Robo4 cooperates with Cxcr4 to endow HSCs with competitive access to limited stem cell niches, and we propose Robo4 as a therapeutic target in HSC transplantation therapy."

We and another group previously showed that Ang1 and Tie2 form distinct signaling complexes at cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. We further demonstrated that the former up-regulates Notch ligand delta-like 4 (Dll4) only in the presence of cell-cell contacts. Because Dll4/Notch signal restricts sprouting angiogenesis and promotes vascular stabilization, we investigated the mechanism of how the Ang1/Tie2 signal induces Dll4 expression to clarify the role of the Dll4/Notch signal in Ang1/Tie2 signal-mediated vascular quiescence. Under confluent endothelial cells, the basal Notch signal was observed. Ang1, moreover, induced Dll4 expression and production of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Ang1 stimulated transcriptional activity of β-catenin through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Correspondingly, the GSK3β inhibitor up-regulated Dll4, whereas depletion of β-catenin by siRNA blocked Ang1-induced Dll4 expression, indicating the indispensability of β-catenin in Ang1-mediated up-regulation of Dll4. In addition, Dll4 expression by the GSK3β inhibitor was only observed in confluent cells, and was impeded by DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor, implying requirement of the Notch signal in β-catenin-dependent Dll4 expression. Consistently, we found that either Ang1 or NICD up-regulates Dll4 through the RBP-J binding site within intron 3 of the DLL4 gene and that β-catenin forms a complex with NICD/RBP-J to enhance Dll4 expression.

Ang1/Tie2 signaling also plays an important role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis, as opposed to its function in quiescent vasculature (7Asahara T. Chen D. Takahashi T. Fujikawa K.

Ang1 induces trans-association of Tie2 in the presence of cell-cell contacts, whereas Tie2 is anchored to the cell-substratum contacts through extracellular matrix-bound Ang1 in the isolated endothelial cells. Trans-associated Tie2 and extracellular matrix-anchored Tie2 stimulate AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways preferable for vascular quiescence and angiogenesis, respectively. angiopoietin-1 delta-like 4 vascular endothelial growth factor Notch intracellular domain glycogen synthase kinase 3β angiopoietin-2 cartilage oligomeric matrix protein N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester human umbilical vein endothelial cells constitutively active mutant of β-catenin constitutively active mutant of AKT. By performing DNA microarray analyses, we have revealed that trans-associated Tie2, but not extracellular matrix-anchored Tie2, regulates the expression of genes involved in vascular quiescence, which include Krüppel-like factor 2, delta-like 4 (Dll4), TIS11d, and connexin-40 (10Fukuhara S.

We have extended the studies on Ang1-mediated vascular quiescence and have shown that Ang1-induced Krüppel-like factor 2 expression occurs through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway-mediated activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2, and counteracts vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated inflammatory responses (12Sako K.

Notch signaling is an evolutionally conserved pathway involved in cell fate specification during embryonic and postnatal development, and plays crucial roles in multiple aspects of vascular development such as arterial venous cell fate determination and tip/stalk cell specification during sprouting angiogenesis (13Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar, 14Gridley T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Phng L.K.

Delta/Serrate/Lag2 ligands bind to Notch family receptors in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner, leading to cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD cleaved from Notch enters into the nucleus, associates with transcription factor RBP-J, and regulates the expression of Hes (Hairy/Enhancer of Slit) and Hey (Hes related with YRPW, also known as HesR, HRT and HERP) family of transcriptional repressors (16Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). During the tip-stalk cell communication during sprouting angiogenesis, the Dll4/Notch signal is well characterized (17Hellström M. Phng L.K. Hofmann J.J. Wallgard E. Coultas L. Lindblom P. Alva J.

The stalk cells subsequently lose their responsiveness to VEGF through down-regulation of VEGF receptors such as VEGFR2 and Neuropilin-1 (22Williams C.K. Li J.L. Murga M. Harris A.L. Tosato G. Blood. 2006; 107: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), thereby maintaining a quiescent and stabilized phenotype. Similarly, Dll4/Notch signaling is reported to be involved in tumor angiogenesis. In tumor vasculature, tumor-derived VEGF induces Dll4 expression in endothelial cells, which acts as a negative regulator of tumor angiogenesis, but is required for formation of functional vascular network (23Li J.L.

Indeed, blockade of Dll4/Notch signaling in tumor vasculature inhibits tumor growth by promoting non-productive angiogenesis associated with excessive sprouting from tumor vessels. The effect of Dll4/Notch signaling on tumor vasculature is reminiscent of that of Ang1/Tie2 signaling. Ang1/Tie2 signaling is also capable of inducing normalization of tumor vasculature by reducing excessive endothelial sprouting and promoting pericyte coverage (26Augustin H.G. Koh G.Y. Thurston G.

It has been reported that conditional deletion of RBP-J, the key transcription factor downstream of the Notch receptor, induces spontaneous angiogenesis in quiescent adult vasculature (31Dou G.R.

Similarly, Tie2 is activated in the endothelium of quiescent adult vasculature, and is believed to be involved in the maintenance of vascular quiescence (6Wong A.L. Haroon Z.A. Werner S.

Furthermore, both Ang1/Tie2 and Dll4/Notch signaling promote recruitment of mural cells to the vessel wall and induce deposition of basement membrane proteins around the vessels, both of which are important for vascular stabilization (26Augustin H.G.

Besides the role for the Dll4/Notch signal in the tip-stalk communication, the Dll4/Notch signal appears to function in mature blood vessels with tight interendothelial cell-cell contacts. Functional similarity between the Ang1/Tie2 signal and Dll4/Notch signal and our previous data that Ang1 induced Dll4 expression prompted us to test our hypothesis that the Ang1/Tie2 signal may promote vascular stabilization through the Dll4/Notch signal and to investigate how Dll4 is induced by Ang1/Tie2 signaling. In this study, we found that Ang1 induces activation of β-catenin through PI3K/AKT pathway-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and that the stabilized β-catenin subsequently enhances Notch signal-induced Dll4 expression by forming a complex with NICD/RBP-J on the Dll4 intron3 enhancer, thereby potentiating the Dll4/Notch signal leading to vascular stabilization.

Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from Kurabo, and maintained in HuMedia-MvG with a growth additive set. The cells were placed on collagen-coated plates at densities of 2,000 and 40,000 cells/cm2, and cultured overnight to obtain sparse and confluent cell cultures, respectively. HUVECs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

As a control, siRNA duplexes with irrelevant sequences were used. Then, the cells were harvested, re-plated on collagen-coated plates, and cultured for an additional 24 h before experiments. HUVECs were infected with adenovirus vectors at the appropriate multiplicity of infection. Forty-eight h after infection, the cells were used for experiments. The DNA, including intron 3 of the human DLL4 gene, was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA extracted from HUVECs as a template and the following primer set: 5′-gtgagtagctcgctccgc-3′ and 5′-ctgagggggcagagggtc-3′. The amplified DNA was cloned into pGL3 Promoter vector (Promega Corporation) to construct the Dll4-Int3-Luc reporter plasmid. To generate the Dll4-Int3mut-Luc reporter plasmid, the RBP-J binding site was mutated using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the Dll4-Int3-Luc plasmid as a template. To construct the p3xFLAG-NICD plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged NICD, a DNA fragment encoding the Notch1 intracellular domain was excised from the pcDNA-FLAG-Notch1-ICD vector, a gift from M. Kurabayashi (Gunma University), and subcloned into p3xFLAG-CMV10 vector (Sigma). A cDNA encoding human Foxc2 was amplified by PCR using human heart cDNAs as a template, and cloned into pERed-NLS vector, a gift from M. Matsuda (40Aoki K. Nakamura T. Fujikawa K. Matsuda M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), namely pERed-NLS-Foxc2 plasmid. A 3.7-kb fragment of the mouse Dll4 promoter (−3631/+76) cloned in the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega Corporation) has already been reported (41Seo S. Fujita H. Nakano A. Kang M. Duarte A. Kume T. Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid encoding the constitutively active form of β-catenin (CA-βCat) in which Ser37 is replaced with Ala, was kindly provided by J. S. Gutkind (National Institute of Health). Other vectors are purchased as follows: pRL-SV40 and pRL-TK from Promega Corporation and TOPflash reporter plasmid from Millipore Corporation. Recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding LacZ and the constitutively active form of AKT (CA-AKT) were kindly provided by M. Matsuda (Kyoto University) and Y. Fujio (Osaka University), respectively. Endothelial cells placed on collagen-coated plates under either sparse or confluent culture conditions were starved in medium 199 containing 1% BSA for 12 h, and stimulated with either 400 ng/ml of COMP-Ang1 or 10 μm SB216763 as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, total RNA was purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out using the QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) as described (12Sako K. Fukuhara S. Minami T. Hamakubo T. Song H. Kodama T. Fukamizu A. Gutkind J.S. Koh G.Y. Mochizuki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5592-5601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 100 ng of total RNA was transcribed for 10 min at 50 °C, followed by a denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. Fluorescence data were collected and analyzed using Mastercycler ep realplex (Eppendorf). The primers used for amplification were as follows: human Dll4, 5′-tccaactgcccttcaatttcac-3′ and 5′-ctggatggcgatcttgctga-3′; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-atggggaaggtgaaggtcg-3′ and 5′-ggggtcattgatggcaacaata-3′. For normalization, expression of human GAPDH was determined in parallel as an endogenous control. Confluent and sparse HUVECs plated on a collagen-coated dish were starved in medium 199 containing 1% BSA for 12 h, and stimulated as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as precleared cell lysate. To detect the Dll4 protein expression and the NICD production, the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-Dll4 and anti-NICD antibodies. To evaluate phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β, aliquots of cell lysate were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-AKT and anti-phospho-GSK3β antibodies, respectively. The total contents of AKT and GSK3β in each cell lysate were also assayed in a parallel run using corresponding antibodies. To detect interaction between NICD and β-catenin, NICD was immunoprecipitated with anti-NICD antibody from the precleared lysates. Immunoprecipitated NICD and aliquots of cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-β-catenin and anti-NICD antibodies, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was performed as described previously (42Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs plated on a collagen-coated dish were transfected with different expression vectors, together with reporter plasmids as described in the figure legends. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with empty vector. The cells were harvested, and re-plated on the collagen-coated 24-well plate in confluent culture conditions. Luciferase activity was assayed 48 h after the transfection. To examine the effect of COMP-Ang1, the cells were starved and stimulated as described in the figure legends. The cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega Corporation), and luciferase activities in cell extract were determined using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega Corporation). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using the EZ ChIPTM kit (Millipore Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent HUVECs plated on collagen-coated dishes were starved in medium 199 containing 1% BSA for 12 h, and stimulated with 400 ng/ml of COMP-Ang1 for 30 min. After stimulation, genomic DNA and protein were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde (1% final concentration) directly to culture medium, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT). The cells were then harvested, lysed, and sonicated to generate 0.3–1.0-kb DNA fragments. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was incubated with anti-RBP-J, anti-NICD, anti-β-catenin, and control antibodies for immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitated and input DNA were used as a template for PCR amplification. PCR amplifications were carried out using the primers specific for intron 3 of the human Dll4 gene (5′-gacgcttagcttggcctggagctg-3′ and 5′-tgtaaaatacaggaaggggcccgtcag-3′). PCR sensitivity was evaluated with serial dilutions of input DNA collected after sonication. Amplified DNA was separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Endothelial cell tube formation assay was performed according to the method of Davis and co-workers (43Koh W. Stratman A.N. Sacharidou A. Davis G.E. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 443: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). HUVECs were suspended in 2.5 mg/ml of collagen type I matrices (Nitta Gelatin) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in medium 199 containing reduced serum supplement, bFGF at 40 ng/ml, and ascorbic acid at 50 μg/ml. During the incubation, the cells were stimulated with or without COMP-Ang1 in the presence or absence of 20 μm DAPT. The cultures were fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at RT, and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 12 h at 4 °C. To detect extracellular deposition of collagen type IV, the cultures were stained with anti-collagen type IV antibody for 12 h at 4 °C, and visualized with Alexa 488-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG. To visualize filamentous actin, the cultures were subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at RT, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for 12 h at 4 °C. Fluorescence images of Alexa 488 and rhodamine were recorded with a FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus Corporation) with a ×20 water immersion objective lens. To quantify the extracellular deposition of collagen type IV, fluorescence intensity of Alexa 488 within the areas of the rhodamine-marked tube structures was determined using FluoView software (Olympus Corporation). Data were expressed as average pixel intensity in the areas of tube structures. The values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance or unpaired t test. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We previously found that Dll4 expression was up-regulated in confluent HUVECs stimulated with Ang1 by the microarray analyses (10Fukuhara S. Sako K. Minami T. Noda K. Kim H.Z. Kodama T. Shibuya M. Takakura N. Koh G.Y. Mochizuki N. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2008; 10: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To first confirm whether Dll4 expression is increased by Ang1 in the HUVECs with cell-cell contacts, HUVECs were stimulated with COMP-Ang1, a potent Ang1 variant, under either confluent or sparse culture conditions. Before the stimulation, Dll4 mRNA was ∼4 times higher in confluent HUVECs than in the sparse cells, indicating that the basal Notch signal is present in the HUVECs with cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1A). COMP-Ang1 significantly increased Dll4 mRNA in the confluent HUVECs, which peaked at 1 h after the stimulation and immediately declined to the basal level by 2 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, DLL4 mRNA levels were increased by stimulation with COMP-Ang1 in human aortic endothelial cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells under confluent culture conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). However, in the sparse HUVECs, DLL4 mRNA was not affected by the stimulation with COMP-Ang1 (Fig. 1A). Consistently, Dll4 in the confluent HUVECs was higher than that in the sparse cells, and was increased in response to COMP-Ang1 (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, COMP-Ang1 did not induce Dll4 in the sparse cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Dll4 was induced by native Ang1 as well as COMP-Ang1, but not by Ang2, an antagonist for Tie2 (Fig. 1, E and F). These results suggest that Dll4 up-regulation by Ang1 depends on the cell-cell contacts that allow activation of Notch signaling, and is dependent on the specific signal downstream of the trans-associated Tie2 by Ang1.

KDR plays a critical role in the proliferation of endothelial cells by controlling VEGF-induced phospholipase Cγ-protein kinase C (PLCγ-PKC) signaling. The function of Flt1, however, remains to be clarified. Recent evidence has indicated that Flt1 regulates the VEGF-triggered migration of endothelial cells and macrophages. Here, we show that RACK1, a ubiquitously expressed scaffolding protein, functions as an important regulator of this process. We found that RACK1 (receptor for activated protein kinase C 1) binds to Flt1 in vitro. When the endogenous expression of RACK1 was attenuated by RNA interference, the VEGF-driven migration was remarkably suppressed whereas the proliferation was unaffected in a stable Flt1-expressing cell line, AG1-G1-Flt1. Further, we demonstrated that the VEGF/Flt-mediated migration of AG1-G1-Flt1 cells occurred mainly via the activation of the PI3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Rac1 pathways, and that RACK1 plays a crucial regulatory role in promoting PI3K/Akt-Rac1 activation.

Angiogenesis is a critical and complicated process in embryonic vascular development, wound healing, and organ regeneration as well as in multiple pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and tumor growth (1Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). A number of molecules including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β have been implicated in angiogenesis. Among known angiogenic factors, VEGF has emerged as a central regulator of vascular development during embryogenesis as well as the formation of blood vessels from the newborn to adult stages (1Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar, 2Coultas L. Chawengsaksophak K. Rossant J.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The VEGF family, consisting of VEGF-A (or simply VEGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D and placenta growth factor (PlGF), directly initiate angiogenic signals by interacting with their receptors (3Shibuya M. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 5Lohela M. Bry M. Tammela T. Alitalo K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). VEGF executes various cellular functions largely by binding to 2 homologous tyrosine kinase receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt1 or VEGFR1), and kinase domain receptor/fetal liver kinase 1 (KDR 2The abbreviations used are: KDR, kinase domain receptor; RACK, receptor for activated protein kinase C; BCIP, 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate; NBT, nitroblue tetrazolium./Flk1 or VEGFR2). Both receptors contain 7 extracellular immunoglobin-like regions, 1 short transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine-kinase domain that is divided by a kinase-insert sequence (6Shibuya M. Yamaguchi S. Yamane A. Ikeda T. Tojo A. Matsushime H. Sato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar, 7Terman B.I. Carrion M.E. Kovacs E. Rasmussen B.A. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1677-1683PubMed Google Scholar). Flt1 has high affinity for VEGF (Kd = 2∼10 pm), but weak kinase activity (10-fold less than that of KDR) (8Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies have suggested that the 2 receptors are essential for embryonic development: Flt1-null mutant mice (Flt1−/−) died at E8.5–9.0 due to the excess growth and disorganization of blood vessels, whereas KDR/Flk1−/− mice also died at E-8.5, but due to a lack of blood vessels (9Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 10Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these studies demonstrate that the 2 receptors utilize distinct signaling cascades to regulate different biological functions. Interestingly, we previously showed that Flt1 tyrosine kinase domain-deficient mice (Flt1 TK−/−) were healthy and had normal blood vessel networks, and thus, the function of Flt1 early in embryogenesis is most likely the trapping of VEGF to reduce its local concentration (11Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). VEGF launches receptor-relayed signaling events by binding to the second and third IgG-like domains of Flt1 and KDR, respectively (12Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Tyr(Y)-1175 on KDR leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC)γ, which in turn promotes the intracellular mobilization of calcium and activates a crucial protein kinase C-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (PKC-Raf-MAPK) cascade, the latter regulating endothelial cell proliferation (14Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi T.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Tyr(Y)-1169 on Flt1 also provides a binding site for PLCγ and activates a PLCγ-MAPK cascade (17Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, both receptors appear to activate the PI3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway (18Lee T.H. Seng S. Sekine M. Hinton C. Fu Y. Avraham H.K. Avraham S. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e186Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Suzuma K. Naruse K. Suzuma I. Takahara N. Ueki K. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40725-40731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting weak signals for VEGF-deprived cell growth and survival, Flt1 is also involved in regulating cell movement in both endothelial cells and macrophage-lineage cells. Loss of Flt1 expression in endothelial cells led to a decrease in sprout formation and cell migration, which resulted in reduced vascular branching (20Kearney J.B. Kappas N.C. Ellerstrom C. DiPaola F.W. Bautch V.L. Blood. 2004; 103: 4527-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). VEGF induces the migration and activation of macrophage-lineage cells into tumor tissue or inflamed areas by binding to Flt1 (11Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8211-8221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Flt1 plays a key role in regulating VEGF-induced cell migration and cell growth, however, the precise signaling pathway under Flt1 remains to be characterized. RACK1 (receptor for activated protein kinase C 1), a 36-kDa protein containing 7 internal Trp-Asp 40 (WD40) repeats, is homologous to the G protein β subunit and expressed ubiquitously in both human and animal tissues (25McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). RACK1 was originally cloned as an anchoring protein for PKCs, and can stabilize the active form of PKC, and permit its translocation to different sites within the cell (26Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 27Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21395-21398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have implied that RACK1 can associate with a variety of signaling molecules, including members of the Src family, the integrin β subunit, PDE45, and IGF-1 receptors, to regulate cell cycle, survival, adhesion, and migration (25McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Such reports imply that RACK1 may function as a scaffolding protein to mediate protein-protein interaction and facilitate tight regulation of cellular function as well as control the cross-talk in different signaling cascades. Here, we provide evidence that RACK1 plays a regulatory role in VEGF-Flt1-dependent cell migration through direct interaction with Flt1. When the endogenous expression of RACK1 was attenuated by RNA interference (RNAi) in a stable Flt1-expressing cell line, the VEGF-induced migration was remarkably suppressed whereas the proliferation was not affected. Moreover, the activation of PI3K/Akt and small-GTPase Rac1 signaling pathways was clearly inhibited by the RACK1-silencing. Our study indicates a new possible mechanism of VEGF-Flt1-induced migration. The recombinant human-VEGF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The anti-RACK1 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from BD transduction laboratories (San Diego, CA). The antibodies against Akt, phospho-Akt, MAPK, phospho-MAPK, PLCγ, and phospho-PLCγ were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-Flt1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Technology (Santa Cruz, CA). The Rac1 activation assay Biochem kit TM was bought from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). The protein G-Sepharose TM 4 Fast Flow was from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). The BD BioCoatTM Angiogenesis System-Endothelial Cell Migration 24-well Plate was obtained from BD Bioscience (Bedford, MA). The AP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The FuGENE® 6 Transfection Reagent was purchased from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). The LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX reagent was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The GAL4-based MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system II (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used for the yeast two-hybrid assays. The plasmid vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424 encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the GAL4-activating domain, respectively, were used to express hybrid proteins. A mixture of embryonic and adult human brain cDNA libraries (both from Clontech) in the GAL4-activating domain vector pACT2 was screened using the intracellular domain of Flt1 (Flt1-IC) cloned into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9 as bait in the PJ69–4A yeast system. DNAs from positive clones were isolated, and the GAL4-activating domain plasmids were recovered in Escherichia coli strain HB101, and sequenced. The DNA-binding domain or GAL4-activating domain was assayed for selection of drop-out leucine, tryptophan, adenine, and histidine and for galactosidase activity on nitrocellulose filters as described in the Clontech manual. AG1-G1-Flt1 cells were established from a human angioma with the permission of the Ethics Committee for scientific research at the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo (28Ishizaki H. Tsunoda T. Wada S. Yamauchi M. Shibuya M. Tahara H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 5841-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, an adult benign angioma was excised surgically, and the pEF1α-SV40 large T antigen plasmid was introduced into the cells. An SV40 large T-positive AG1-G1 cell was isolated, and then pBCMGS-Neo-Flt1 carrying the full-length Flt1 cDNA (29Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), or the empty vector pBCMGS-Neo was transfected into AG1-G1 cells. A single cell clone expressing Flt1 was isolated and designated as AG1-G1-Flt1. The AG1-G1-Neo and AG1-G1-Flt1 cells were maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; JRH biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and 200 μg/ml of G-418 at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All the DNA plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells using the FuGENE® 6 Transfection Reagent according to instructions. The following stealth siRNAs designed based on the human RACK1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number GNB2L1) were obtained from Invitrogen. The sequences of the two RACK1 siRNAs used in this study are: si1, GCCUCUCGAGAUAAGACCAUCAUCA and si2, GGAACCUGGCUAACUGCAAGCUGAA. AG1-G1-Neo and AG-G1-Flt1 cells were transfected with the RACK1 siRNAs or negative control siRNA using the LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The effect of suppression on RACK1 expression was assessed 60 h post-transfection. Cellular protein extracts were prepared by washing cells with cold PBS and then scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysate was briefly centrifuged for 10 min to remove the insoluble debris. The lysate (20–40 μg each) was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were soaked in blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h, and incubated with the primary antibody overnight. The membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min and visualized using a 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) detection system (Promega, Madison, WI). For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysate was incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was then added, and the mixture was further incubated for 1 h. The agarose beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblotting. The cell migration assay was carried out using a BioCoatTM Angiogenesis System-Endothelial Cell Migration 24-well plate (BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA). Briefly, the cells were trypsinized and suspended at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in F-12 medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cell suspension (100 μl) was loaded into each of the upper wells, and fresh F-12 medium (0.5% FBS) containing VEGF (100 ng/ml) was placed in the lower wells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 23 h, and the cells were fixed and stained with 4 μg/ml of Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells on the top of the filter were removed by wiping with a cotton swab, and chemotaxis was quantified with an immunofluorescence microscope by counting cells that had migrated to the bottom of the filter. The activation of Rac1 was analyzed by using a Rac1 activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) according to the instructions recommended by the manufacturer. The Rac1 activation assay was a direct pull-down experiment performed to measure the binding of GTP-bound Rac1 to a GST-fused form of the p21-binding domain of PAK (GST-PAK-PBD) fixed onto glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in sample buffer. The samples were measured by Western blotting. Trypsinized cells (0.5 × 104) were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The medium was replaced with fresh F-12 medium containing 0.5% FBS and 100 ng/ml of VEGF, and the plates were incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). They were then stained with Sulforhodamine B (SRB) in 1% acetic acid for 20 min, and the plates were washed and dried overnight. The dye was solubilized by adding 100 μl of 10 mm Tris base to each well at room temperature for 20 min, and the absorbance (A) at 540 nm was measured using a Asys Hitech Microplate Reader (Biochrom UK). Following fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, cells treated under different experimental conditions were further permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, then incubated with the primary antibody for 60 min. They were washed with PBS and incubated with the immunofluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 30 min. For the visualization of F-actin, cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Finally, the coverslips were washed thoroughly with PBS and mounted on glass slides. Images were captured and analyzed with a Radiance 2000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). To obtain a model for clarifying the function and signaling under Flt1, we generated a stable Flt1-expressing human cell line, called AG1-G1-Flt1, by introducing Flt1 cDNA into a benign angioma cell line. As shown in Fig. 1A, the Flt1 level in AG1-G1-Flt cells was ∼1000-fold that in AG1-G1-Neo cells, whereas KDR expression was suppressed to an undetectable level. Next, we performed a migration assay using AG1-G1-Neo and AG1-G1-Flt1 cells to assess the effect of Flt1 on the VEGF-induced cell migration. As shown in Fig. 1B, VEGF treatment remarkably increased the migration of AG1-G1-Flt1 cells about 3-fold, whereas the number of migrating AG1-G1-Neo cells was not altered even in the presence of VEGF. These results provide evidence that Flt1 mediates VEGF-driven cell migration. A two-hybrid screening assay to identify the partner of Flt1 uncovered RACK1, a ubiquitously expressed scaffolding protein, which bound Flt1-IC (the truncated intracellular domain of Flt1) as bait. To determine whether the interaction of Flt1 with RACK1 occurs in mammalian cells, several tag-conjugated constructs including FLAG-RACK1, FLAG-Flt1-IC, and Myc-Flt1-IC were individually expressed or co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Schematic diagrams of these constructs and their normal expression patterns are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The lysates extracted from HEK293T cells expressing the constructs described above were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments with the FLAG antibody, the results of which showed that Flt1-IC and RACK1 can bind to each other (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). Next, the association was examined using immunofluorescence microscopy. Myc-Flt1-IC co-localized with endogenous RACK1 expressed at the periphery of the cytosol (Fig. 2D). These findings provide evidence that RACK1 can interact with Flt1 within the cell. Additionally, the lysates from AG1-G1-Neo and AG1-G1-Flt1 cells exposed to VEGF were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flt1 or anti-RACK1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, although the endogenous RACK1 constitutively associated with Flt1 in the absence of VEGF, the amount of the Flt1-RACK1 complex increased ∼3-fold following stimulation with VEGF. However the interaction was undetected in the AG1-G1-Neo control cell line in which Flt1 is not expressed (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. S2). On the other hand, our results also showed that the p85 subunit of PI3K did not bind to either Flt1 or RACK1 at detectable levels (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these results indicate that Flt1 can interact with RACK1 directly, and VEGF promotes the formation of a complex between the two proteins, whereas PI3K is not involved. The finding that Flt1 interacts with RACK1 raises the possibility that the multifunctional RACK1 protein is involved in the VEGF/Flt1-mediated cellular functions. We therefore employed RNA interference to investigate the role of RACK1. Two siRNAs (Invitrogen) designed based on the human RACK1 gene showed a very strong suppressing effect with about a 90% reduction in RACK1 expression (Fig. 3A, upper panel). However, the expression and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Flt1 were not affected significantly under the conditions (Fig. 3A, middle panel). These observations imply that RACK1 does not affect the upstream events of the VEGF-Flt1 signaling pathway. We next examined the effect of RACK1-silencing on VEGF/Flt1-mediated cell migration. As compared with control AG1-G1-Neo cells which showed no obvious increase in migration after VEGF treatment, the VEGF-induced migration of AG1-G1-Flt1 cells was remarkably suppressed by RACK1-silencing (Fig. 3B). These results clearly implied that RACK1 plays an important role in the VEGF/Flt1-triggered signaling. To evaluate the role of RACK1 in VEGF/Flt1-triggered cell proliferation, the effect of RACK1-silencing on the VEGF-induced growth of AG1-G1-Neo and AG1-G1-Flt1 cells was analyzed. Indeed, even after 72 h, VEGF did not significantly promote proliferation in either cell line (Fig. 4). Certainly, RACK1-silencing did not specifically affect Flt1-mediated proliferation. The growth of AG1-G1-Neo cells unaffected in their response to VEGF is easily understood given the deficiency of the two receptors, whereas the similar effect obtained in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells suggests that Flt1-mediated signaling does not or only very weakly promotes cell growth. The slight inhibitory effect on growth in the two cell lines following RACK-silencing may be due to the intrinsic regulatory role of RACK1 in cell proliferation but independent of the Flt1-relayed signals. Thus, these results indicate that RACK1 plays a more critical role in Flt1-related cell migration than cell proliferation. VEGF launches a crucial signal via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as PLCγ-PKC-MAPK pathway to control cell behavior including the migration and survival of endothelial cells (19Suzuma K.

Cancer. 2006; 119: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In our model, Akt was activated by VEGF treatment in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells, and the phosphorylation was slightly stronger on stimulation with 100 ng/ml or 200 ng/ml than 50 ng/ml of the growth factor for 5 min (Fig. 5A). This phenotype did not occur in the control AG1-G1-Neo cells. Meanwhile, in a time-course experiment, the phosphorylation of Akt peaked at 5∼10 min and remained high for over 30 min after exposure to VEGF (Fig. 5B). These results clearly show that VEGF activates the PI3K/Akt pathway via Flt1. Next, the potential role of RACK1 in this Flt1-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt cascade was examined. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, RACK1-silencing in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells led to a remarkable decrease in Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that RACK1 plays an important role in the downstream signaling of VEGF-Flt1 by regulating activation of Akt. Previous studies revealed that the phosphorylation of 1169-Tyr of Flt1 corresponding to 1175-Tyr of KDR relays a signal to PLCγ and MAPK, leading to the proliferation of endothelial cells (15Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 16Sakurai Y. Ohgimoto K. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

VEGF induced modest phosphorylation of PLCγ at 5 min in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells, however, RACK1-silencing did not affect this phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Moreover, the vigorous constitutive activation of MAPK was observed in both AG1-G1-Neo and AG1-G1-Flt1 cells (Fig. 6A, middle panel). We consider that the establishment of immortalized cell lines with T-antigen most likely resulted in this constitutive activation. Therefore, we could not draw a conclusion about the importance of RACK1 in the VEGF-Flt1-MAPK activation pathway. Several kinase inhibitors including wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), U0126 (MAPK inhibitor) and SU5416 (VEGFR kinase inhibitor) were used to clarify which of these signaling molecules is involved in regulating the VEGF-induced cell migration. As shown in Fig. 6B, VEGF increased the migration of AG1-G1-Flt1 cells, and this effect was significantly blocked in the presence of wortmannin and SU5416. In contrast, no suppressive effect was observed on treatment with U0126. These results suggest that the Flt1-PI3K signaling pathway is involved in VEGF-triggered cell migration whereas MAPK is not. More recently, several groups have demonstrated that small-GTPase Rac1 participates in VEGF-driven endothelial cell migration by regulating the actin reorganization, lamellipodial structures, and focal adhesions (33Del Valle-Pérez B. Martinez V.G. Lacasa-Salavert C. Figueras A. Shapiro S.S. Takafuta T. Casanovas O. Capellà G. Ventura F. Viñals F. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the activation of Rac1 is essential for VEGF-induced AG1-G1-Flt1 migration and the potential role of RACK1 in this process, we measured the effect of RACK1-silencing on the Flt1-related activation of Rac1. As shown in Fig. 7A, Rac1 was activated at 3 min after VEGF treatment in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells, and RACK1-silencing intensively suppressed this VEGF-driven activation of Rac1. Because the activated Rac1 induces broad membrane ruffling (35Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar), we further assessed the effect of RACK1-silencing on VEGF-triggered ruffling. As shown in Fig. 7B, stimulation with VEGF increased the membrane ruffling (62%) in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells compared with that in untreated cells (24.4%). RACK-silencing remarkably reduced the VEGF-dependent ruffling (35%). These results indicate that RACK1 plays a regulatory role in VEGF-induced Rac1 activation and membrane ruffling. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the downstream signaling pathway of Flt1. By using a two-hybrid approach, we found that RACK1, an important scaffolding protein, can directly interact with Flt1. Inhibition of the endogenous expression of RACK1 suppressed the VEGF-dependent activation of Akt and Rac1, resulting in decreased cell migration in a stable Flt1-expressing cell line where KDR was undetectable. The cellular function and intracellular signaling of Flt1 remain unclear. Indeed, the lack of an experimental model has severely impeded research in this area. Recently, we generated a cell line, AG1-G1-Flt1, which stably expresses human Flt1. The Flt1 expression level in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells is comparable to that in primary vascular endot"

Calcineurin-NFAT signaling triggers lineage commitment in embryonic stem cells Src is a key player downstream of the NFAT and Erk1/2 pathways Src-mediated signaling promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition Calcineurin-NFAT signaling is required for early embryonic lineage development During early mouse development, lineage specification begins at embryonic day 2.5 (E2.5) in 8-cell embryos. The first lineage decision leads to the establishment of the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm at the blastocyst stage. The second lineage decision gives rise to the epiblast and the primitive endoderm when the latter delaminates from the ICM (Rossant, 2007Rossant J. Stem cells and lineage development in the mammalian blastocyst.Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 2007; 19: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Rossant et al., 2003Rossant J. Chazaud C. Yamanaka Y.

The epiblast contains pluripotent cells that generate the three germ layers as well as germ cells. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the preimplantation blastocyst, have the potential to differentiate into all cell types of an organism and to grow indefinitely in culture (Martin, 1981Martin G.R.

Mouse ESCs can be maintained in an undifferentiated self-renewal state in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and either bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) or serum without feeder cells (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L.

Withdrawal of LIF results in extensive ESC differentiation with downregulation of the pluripotency-associated core transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Kim et al., 2008Kim J. Chu J. Shen X.

Recently, maintaining ESCs at a ground state of self-renewal in the absence of LIF and serum was reported via two inhibitors (2i) of fibroblast growth factor/extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (Fgf/Erk1/2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L.

Despite these major advances, the molecular basis for ESCs to transit from the state of self-renewal to early differentiation has not been fully elucidated. The Fgf/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway is considered important for the formation of the first two extraembryonic lineages (trophectoderm and primitive endoderm) in early murine development and for ESC differentiation in vitro (Chazaud et al., 2006Chazaud C.

We were interested in the question of whether there are additional signaling pathways critical for the early lineage specification and, if so, how they may be integrated to orchestrate early development. To address this question, we employed the piggyBac (PB) transposon, which randomly inserts into a host genome and disrupts gene function (Ding et al., 2005Ding S. Wu X. Li G. Han M. Zhuang Y. Xu T. Efficient transposition of the piggyBac (PB) transposon in mammalian cells and mice.Cell. 2005; 122: 473-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and then selected transfected ESC colonies with undifferentiated ESC morphology after LIF withdrawal. One gene that was identified through this approach was Cnb1, also known as Ppp3r1, which encodes calcium binding B (CnB), a subunit of calcineurin. Calcineurin is a Ca2+ influx-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase composed of the CnA and CnB subunits (Crabtree, 1999Crabtree G.R. Generic signals and specific outcomes: signaling through Ca2+, calcineurin, and NF-AT.Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, Crabtree and Schreiber, 2009Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. SnapShot: Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT signaling.Cell. 2009; 138: 210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Three genes (Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb, and Ppp3cc) encode three members of the catalytic CnA subunit, whereas two members of the regulatory CnB unit of calcineurin are products of two genes (Ppp3r1 and Ppp3r2). Calcineurin dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell, the products of four NFATc genes, NFATc1-c4) to promote translocation of NFAT to the nucleus, where NFAT and its usual partner AP1 (Fos/Jun, substrates of Erk1/2) bind target promoters to control the expression of genes with diverse functions. Although NFAT proteins were first recognized for their central role in T lymphocyte activation, they have since been demonstrated to orchestrate diverse developmental programs, including nervous, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, and muscular-skeletal development, as well as to maintain the quiescent state of stem cells in skin (Chin et al., 1998Chin E.R.

However, the expression and function of calcineurin-NFAT signaling in ESCs, as well as in early embryonic development at the peri-implantation stage, have remained unnoticed, possibly because of genetic redundancy among family members of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. The advent of pharmacologic inhibitors of NFAT translocation has greatly facilitated our understanding of the functions of calcineurin-NFAT signaling. The specificity of these inhibitors for calcineurin, and potentially NFAT, was established based upon the nearly identical phenotypes observed for Cnb1 null mice, NFATc3/c4 double null mice, and embryos of mothers given the inhibitor at E7.5 to E8.5 (Crabtree and Olson, 2002Crabtree G.R.

Here, utilizing the inhibitors and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that calcineurin-NFAT signaling is both necessary and sufficient to trigger lineage commitment through the upregulation of Src expression to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mouse ESCs. A PB plasmid (PGK-Neo) and a PBase expression plasmid (Act-PBase) were coelectroporated into ESCs and transfectants were selected with G418 in the presence of LIF and serum, as described (Ding et al., 2005Ding S. Wu X. Li G. Han M. Zhuang Y. Xu T. Efficient transposition of the piggyBac (PB) transposon in mammalian cells and mice.Cell. 2005; 122: 473-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Approximately 1000 G418-resistant colonies were obtained from each 10 cm dish. Colonies that maintained an undifferentiated morphology in the absence of LIF after several passages in culture were expanded. Integration sites were analyzed with inverse PCR. Among these sites, genes were identified that potentially associate with the Ras-MAPK, Akt, and calcineurin signaling pathways, such as Grb10, Ptpn21, Inpp4b, and Ppp3r1 (Table S1 available online). We were particularly interested in the Ppp3r1 gene (Figure S1A), because it encodes the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, and the role of calcineurin-NFAT signaling in ESCs has not been reported. The disruption of Ppp3r1 expression by PB insertion and its role in the prevention of ESCs from LIF withdrawal-induced differentiation were validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the levels of expression of Ppp3r1 and other marker genes in both control and Ppp3r1-disrupted ESCs (Figure S1B). Subsequently, to determine the function of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, we treated ESCs with cyclosporine A (CsA), a specific inhibitor of calcineurin (Clipstone and Crabtree, 1992Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Identification of calcineurin as a key signalling enzyme in T-lymphocyte activation.Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar), and examined cell morphology and the expression of the marker genes in the presence and absence of LIF. As expected, the removal of LIF resulted in extensively differentiated cell morphology, increased transcript levels for various lineage markers (including Fgf5, Cdx2, Dab2, Nestin, T, and Mixl1), and downregulation of pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Nanog, and Rex1 (Figures 1A and 1B ). Moreover, at the protein level, nuclear staining of Nanog was dramatically reduced after LIF withdrawal (Figure 1C). All these LIF withdrawal-induced changes were efficiently abolished by CsA treatment (Figures 1A–1C), although CsA-treated ESCs displayed a relatively reduced growth rate (Figure S1C). In contrast, CsA did not affect the LIF withdrawal-induced reduction in the level of phosphorylated Stat3, although it did block the LIF withdrawal-induced decrease in total Stat3 protein levels (Figure S1D). The inhibitory effect of CsA on calcineurin-NFAT signaling under such conditions was verified by a reporter assay (Figure S1E). Furthermore, FK506 (the unrelated calcineurin inhibitor) and the NFAT-selective inhibitory peptide VIVIT (Yu et al., 2007Yu H. van Berkel T.J. Biessen E.A. Therapeutic potential of VIVIT, a selective peptide inhibitor of nuclear factor of activated T cells, in cardiovascular disorders.Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2007; 25: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) significantly attenuated ESC differentiation induced by LIF removal (Figures S1F–S1I). A similar effect was also observed when RNA interference (RNAi) targeting Ppp3r1 was introduced (Figure 1D; Figure S1J), suggesting that the attenuation was calcineurin-NFAT signaling dependent. In addition, CsA could block neural differentiation of ESC-derived epiblast stem cells as well as ESC differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) and during embryoid body (EB) formation (Figures S1K–S1N). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that calcineurin-NFAT signaling is crucial for ESC differentiation in response to various differentiation stimuli. We next sought to determine whether, in the absence of LIF, CsA could maintain ESCs in an undifferentiated state indefinitely. After 40 days, ESCs cultured under such conditions displayed an undifferentiated morphology. After withdrawal of CsA, they retained a normal differentiation potential and formed EBs with differentiated cells expressing markers of all three germ layers (Figures 1E and 1F). Teratomas exhibiting cells of the three germ layers were also detected when these cells were injected into nude mice (Figure 1G). Finally, the ESCs re-entered embryonic development in the chimeric mice (Figure 1H) when CsA-expanded ESCs carrying a histone 2B-GFP gene were injected into mouse blastocysts. Therefore, the inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway can sustain ESC properties for a long period in the absence of LIF. Finally, we cultured CsA-treated ESCs in the serum-free condition in the absence of LIF (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Similar to 2i, CsA or CsA plus the GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR) could maintain the expression of Oct4 and Nanog as well as a compact undifferentiated morphology (Figures S1O and S1P). Moreover, the combination of CsA and CHIR could sustain a cell growth rate comparable to that observed with 2i treatment (Figure S1Q). We then examined the expression patterns of calcineurin and NFAT in mouse ESCs and their progeny. The transcriptional levels of the calcineurin subunits increased when ESCs were induced into differentiation by LIF withdrawal (Figure 2A ). Published microarray data (Ivanova et al., 2006Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J. DeCoste C. Schafer X. Lun Y. Lemischka I.R. Dissecting self-renewal in stem cells with RNA interference.Nature. 2006; 442: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) showed low NFATc1/c2 expression and abundant NFATc3/c4 expression in mouse ESCs (Figure 2B). Results from our western blot analysis indicated that the steady-state level of NFATc4 proteins increased markedly after ESC differentiation, whereas the NFATc3 level remained consistently high (Figure 2C). The specificity of NFATc3 and NFATc4 antibodies was verified by RNAi-specific expression knockdown (Figures S2A and S2B). Notably, NFATc3 was primarily found in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated ESCs but moved to the nucleus after LIF withdrawal (Figure 2D), indicative of NFATc3 activation upon ESC differentiation. In line with this observation, the activity of a luciferase reporter containing three tandem copies of the murine Il2 promoter element, a prototypical NFAT:AP-1 composite (Macián et al., 2000Macián F. García-Rodríguez C. Rao A. Gene expression elicited by NFAT in the presence or absence of cooperative recruitment of Fos and Jun.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4783-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was significantly upregulated after the removal of LIF (Figure 2E). In later experiments of this study, we primarily focused on NFATc3 because of its high expression level in ESCs and rapid activation upon differentiation. To address whether calcineurin-NFAT signaling acts as a permissive signal or if its activation is sufficient to initiate ESC differentiation, we overexpressed constitutively active forms of calcineurin (ΔCnA) or NFATc1-4 (CA-NFATc1-4) in ESCs. Strikingly, in the presence of LIF, forced expression of CA-NFATc1-4 rapidly induced the differentiated cell morphology (Figure 3A ), substantially reduced the mRNA levels of pluripotency genes (Oct4, Nanog, and Rex1), and enhanced the expression of differentiation markers, especially those of the trophectoderm (Cdx2, Hand1) and the primitive endoderm (Gata6, Ihh) (Figure 3B); ΔCnA induced relatively weaker differentiation than did CA-NFATc1-4 (Figures 3C). After injecting ESCs overexpressing CA-NFATc3 into immunodeficient mice, teratomas containing regional hemorrhages were subsequently detected (Figure 3D), suggesting the existence of trophoblastic cell types in the tumor. RT-PCR analysis showed that levels of trophoblast and primitive endoderm markers were markedly higher in teratomas derived from CA-NFATc3-expressing cells than from control cells (Figure 3E). Therefore, the activation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling is sufficient to induce ESCs into early differentiated lineages. To identify the downstream molecules regulated by calcineurin-NFAT signaling, we examined the expression of a repertoire of genes while calcineurin-NFAT signaling was either activated or inhibited. We uncovered 306 candidate targets, including molecules involved in cell migration and focal adhesions (Figures S3A and S3B; Table S2). To find direct NFAT targets, the promoter sequences of these candidate genes were examined for binding sites of NFAT and AP-1, the common cofactor of NFAT (Macián et al., 2001Macián F. López-Rodríguez C. Rao A. Partners in transcription: NFAT and AP-1.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, Sanna et al., 2005Sanna B. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S.

Biol. 2005; 25: 865-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The consensus NFAT and AP-1 binding sites were found upstream of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src (also known as c-Src) gene, and these elements were well conserved (Figure S3C). AP1 is required for Src expression (Jiao et al., 2008Jiao X. Katiyar S. Liu M. Mueller S.C. Lisanti M.P. Li A. Pestell T.G. Wu K. Ju X. Li Z. et al.Disruption of c-Jun reduces cellular migration and invasion through inhibition of c-Src and hyperactivation of ROCK II kinase.Mol. Biol.

Commun. 2004; 325: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas the involvement of NFAT in Src expression has not been reported. The results of qRT-PCR analysis showed that the tetracycline (Tc)-inducible expression of a constitutively active NFATc3 significantly elevated Src transcript levels in an induction-time-dependent manner (Figure 4A ), and the transient overexpression of CA-NFATc3 also increased Src protein levels (Figure 4B). Moreover, the transient expression of ΔCnA or CA-NFATc1-4 substantially upregulated Src transcript levels (Figure S3D), comparable to the effect of activated Ras (Figure S3E). Strikingly, the activation of Src expression and kinase activity by LIF withdrawal was completely abolished by CsA treatment (Figure 4C; Figure S3F), indicating a regulatory role for calcineurin-NFAT signaling in endogenous Src expression. To test whether NFAT directly regulates Src expression, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were conducted with a Src oligo probe (containing the NFAT consensus sequence from the Src promoter), an Il2 control probe, and nuclear extracts from ESCs overexpressing CA-NFATc3 (Figure 4D). NFATc3-containing DNA-protein complexes were identified by the appearance of a super-shifted band when NFATc3 antibody was included in the incubation mixture, which was identical to the super-shifted band observed with the control Il2 probe. To test the functional significance of the NFAT binding site for Src expression, we performed luciferase reporter assays and verified critical roles for NFAT and AP-1 binding sites in Src transcription in response to NFATc3 (Figure 4E). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed an enrichment of NFATc3 at the Src gene, but not at the Cdx2 regulatory region during ESC differentiation induced by either LIF withdrawal or CA-NFATc3 overexpression (Figure 4F). These observations revealed that endogenous NFATc3 or ectopically expressed NFATc3 binds to the Src regulatory sequence in differentiating ESCs but not in undifferentiated ESCs. We next examined whether Src could initiate ESC differentiation. Transient expression of a sustained active form of Src (Src F) (Brábek et al., 2004Brábek J. Constancio S.S. Shin N.Y. Pozzi A. Weaver A.M. Hanks S.K. CAS promotes invasiveness of Src-transformed cells.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7406-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) resulted in the rapid appearance of the differentiated cell morphology (Figure 5A ) with the simultaneous downregulation of pluripotency markers and the activation of differentiation genes. Markers robustly activated by Src F included trophectoderm markers (Cdx2, Hand1, Prl2c2, and Psx1) followed by primitive endoderm lineage markers, such as Gata6 (Figure 5B), which is similar to the expression pattern induced by activated NFAT. To determine whether Src is essential for NFATc3- or LIF withdrawal-initiated ESC differentiation, PP2 (Hamadi et al., 2009Hamadi A. Deramaudt T.B. Takeda K. Rondé P. Src activation and translocation from focal adhesions to membrane ruffles contribute to formation of new adhesion sites.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 324-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a specific Src inhibitor, was used. Strikingly, PP2 efficiently abolished ESC differentiation induced by CA-NFATc3 overexpression or LIF withdrawal, as determined by cell morphology and marker expression (Figures 5C–5F). Interestingly, CsA and PP2 combined treatment sustained a faster cell growth rate than CsA treatment alone (Figure S1C). In addition to PP2, SKI-1, another Src inhibitor, also abrogated LIF withdrawal-induced differentiation (Figures S4A and S4B). Specifically, the knockdown of Src by specific RNAi also markedly attenuated NFATc3- or LIF withdrawal-induced differentiation (Figure 5G; Figure S4D), whereas the depletion of another Src family kinase, Lck, did not block differentiation (Figures S4C and S4D). Our results indicate that Src, like NFAT, is both necessary and sufficient for ESC differentiation. Src is closely associated with EMT, and many EMT inducers (Tgfβ, Fgf family members, Ras-Erk1/2) also induce ESC differentiation (Guarino, 2010Guarino M. Src signaling in cancer invasion.J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 223: 14-26PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether EMT was an essential step for ESC differentiation. In addition to the induction of ESC differentiation, Src F overexpression led to the rapid appearance of typical EMT characteristics (Mandal et al., 2008Mandal M. Myers J.N. Lippman S.M. Johnson F.M. Williams M.D. Rayala S. Ohshiro K. Rosenthal D.I. Weber R.S. Gallick G.E. El-Naggar A.K.

Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6829) Google Scholar), including the activation of EMT markers such as Igf2, SIP1, Ncad, and Snai1, as well as upregulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are critical components of EMT (Figure 6A ; Cavallaro and Christofori, 2004Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Cell adhesion and signalling by cadherins and Ig-CAMs in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The redistribution of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker, was also observed from the membrane to the cytoplasm in Src F-expressing cells (Figure 6B). As upstream activators of Src, both NFAT and Ras also increased expression of the EMT markers (Figures S5A and S5B). Furthermore, E-cadherin redistribution was observed upon either overexpressing active NFATc3 or withdrawing LIF (Figures S5C and S5D). To define the relationship between EMT and ESC lineage commitment, the kinetics of gene expression were examined. After active NFATc3 induction, the elevation of EMT genes (on day 1) occurred prior to the activation of lineage markers (on day 1.5) and the downregulation of pluripotency genes (on day 3) (Figure 6C), suggesting that the EMT process precedes ESC differentiation. Furthermore, the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001, known to prevent EMT (Tan et al., 2010Tan T.K. Zheng G. Hsu T.T. Wang Y. Lee V.W. Tian X. Wang Y. Cao Q. Wang Y. Harris D.C.

The nucleus has long been known to produce superoxide (O2⨪); however, the mechanisms that control this function remain largely unknown. We have characterized molecular features of a nuclear superoxide-producing system in the mouse liver. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we investigated whether several NADPH oxidases (NOX1, 2, and 4) and known activators of NOX (Rac1, Rac2, p22phox, and p47phox) contribute to nuclear O2⨪ production in isolated hepatic nuclei. Our findings demonstrate that NOX4 most significantly contributes to hepatic nuclear O2⨪ production that utilizes NADPH as an electron donor. Although NOX4 protein immunolocalized to both nuclear membranes and intranuclear inclusions, fluorescent detection of NADPH-dependent nuclear O2⨪ predominantly localized to the perinuclear space. Interestingly, NADP+ and G6P also induced nuclear O2⨪ production, suggesting that intranuclear glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) can control NOX4 activity through nuclear NADPH production. Using G6PD mutant mice and G6PD shRNA, we confirmed that reductions in nuclear G6PD enzyme decrease the ability of hepatic nuclei to generate O2⨪ in response to NADP+ and G6P. NOX4 and G6PD protein were also observed in overlapping microdomains within the nucleus. These findings provide new insights on the metabolic pathways for substrate regulation of nuclear O2⨪ production by NOX4.

Understanding the regulatory pathways that control cellular ROS at specific sites in the cell is vital to determining their function in cell signaling (1Chen K. Kirber M.T. Xiao H. Yang Y. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Important for the regulation of redox signaling is the controlled production of ROS at specific intracellular sites such as mitochondria and endosomes. ROS production and transport at these locations are tightly regulated and linked to effector redox signals (2Li Q. Harraz M.M. Zhou W. Zhang L.N. Ding W. Zhang Y. Eggleston T. Yeaman C. Banfi B.

Another, much less studied, site of ROS production is the nucleus. Despite the fact that NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production by the nucleus was discovered over three decades ago (7Yusa T. Crapo J.D. Freeman B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 798: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Patton S.E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. Mol.

Cederbaum A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the regulation and function of nuclear O2⨪ remain largely uncharacterized. Over the years, several enzymes including cytochrome P450 and many others have been suggested as candidate sources of nuclear O2⨪. More recently, endothelial nuclei disrupted by sonication (11Kuroda J. Nakagawa K. Yamasaki T. Nakamura K. Takeya R. Kuribayashi F. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Igarashi K. Shibata Y. Sueishi K. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and endothelial nuclear protein extracts (12Pendyala S. Gorshkova I.A. Usatyuk P.V. He D. Pennathur A. Lambeth J.D. Thannickal V.J. Natarajan V. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 747-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have both been shown to produce ROS that is, at least in part, NOX4-dependent. NOX4 has been localized in nuclei of vascular smooth muscle cells, but its subnuclear localization (such as within specific nuclear membranes) remains unclear (13Lyle A.N. Deshpande N.N. Taniyama Y. Seidel-Rogol B. Pounkova L. Du P. Papaharalambus C. Lassègue B. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Nuclear NOX4 has also been implicated in DNA damage resulting from both hemangioendothelioma formation (14Gordillo G. Fang H. Park H. Roy S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 12: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and hepatitis C infection (15de Mochel N.S. Seronello S. Wang S.H. Ito C. Zheng J.X. Liang T.J. Lambeth J.D. Choi J. Hepatology. 2010; 52: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, NOX4 is not the only NOX localized to nuclei, because nuclear NOX1 and NOX2 have also been described (16Chamulitrat W. Schmidt R. Tomakidi P. Stremmel W. Chunglok W. Kawahara T. Rokutan K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6045-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Van Buul J.D. Fernandez-Borja M. Anthony E.C. Hordijk P.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The γ-isoform of the p47phox homolog NOXO1 (utilized by NOX1) has been shown to localize strongly in nuclei (18Ueyama T. Lekstrom K. Tsujibe S. Saito N. Leto T.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A great deal remains to be learned about which NOX isoforms and associated subunits participate in nuclear ROS production. Nuclei of distinct cell types may utilize different NOX isoforms or splice isoforms (19Goyal P. Weissmann N. Rose F. Grimminger F. Schäfers H.J. Seeger W. Hänze J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and associated subunits to produce nuclear ROS. The NOXs (NOX1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and Duox 1 and 2) are transmembrane proteins that produce superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide. NOX1–4 appear to require association with p22phox for processing and activity, whereas NOX1–3 require additional cytosolic proteins such as p47phox, p67phox, Rac1 or 2, NOXO1, and/or NOXA1 for activation (13Lyle A.N. Deshpande N.N. Taniyama Y. Seidel-Rogol B. Pounkova L. Du P. Papaharalambus C. Lassègue B. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 20Nauseef W.M. J.

Although regulatory components of most of the NOXs are less well understood than those for the phagocytic NOX2, there is general agreement that Rac1, rather than Rac2, is the primary Rac used by nonphagocytic NOXs that are dependent on Rac. Some studies suggest that NOX4 uses p47phox, whereas others suggest it is independent of this subunit (21Opitz N. Drummond G.R. Selemidis S. Meurer S. Schmidt H.H. Free Radic. Biol.

Although unexplored to date, NOX4 may also be regulated by the local availability of its substrate NADPH. Other unresolved questions include whether NOX4 utilizes NADPH or NADH as a substrate to produce O2⨪ (11Kuroda J. Nakagawa K. Yamasaki T. Nakamura K. Takeya R. Kuribayashi F. Imajoh-Ohmi S.

All of these as yet unanswered questions have resulted in numerous interesting, although often apparently contradictory, findings about NOX4 regulation in the nucleus. In the present study, we evaluated the biologic components required for NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production by murine hepatic nuclei. Hepatic nuclei demonstrated an absolute requirement for NADPH, not NADH, as an electron donor for the production of O2⨪. Although these findings differ from previous studies demonstrating NADH dependence of NOX4 in endothelial nuclei (11Kuroda J. Nakagawa K. Yamasaki T. Nakamura K. Takeya R. Kuribayashi F. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Igarashi K. Shibata Y. Sueishi K. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we demonstrate, using in vivo NOX4-shRNA-mediated knockdown, that NOX4 is indeed the primary NADPH-dependent O2⨪ producing enzyme in hepatic nuclei. NOX4-dependent hepatic nuclear O2⨪ appears to be produced directionally into the perinuclear space of the nuclear envelope. Using mutant mice and shRNA knockdown, we also demonstrate that nuclear glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) serves as a major source of NADPH utilized by hepatic nuclear NOX4. These novel findings define a new metabolic pathway for regulating nuclear NOX4 through availability of its substrate. All of the animal studies were performed in accordance with University of Iowa policies and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. For all experiments not involving genetically defined strains, B6SJLF1/j female mice were used at the age of 6–10 weeks.

Rac1flx/flx conditional KO mice, Rac2 KO mice, and AlbCre-Rac1flx/flx/Rac2 KO mice, all on a BL6 background, were a kind gift from Dr. David A. Williams. NOX1, NOX1/2, and AlbCre-Rac1flx/flx/Rac2 KO mice and p22phox mutant mice were bred onto a BL6 background for at least eight generations. NOX2 KO mice and p47phox mutant mice were inbred on a BL6 background for at least 12 generations by the Jackson Laboratories. As controls for all knock-out and mutant mice, age-matched wild-type BL6 mice or littermates were used. The mice were euthanized in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved standard protocols by carbon dioxide gas. The liver was immediately dissected, and hepatic nuclei were purified using a sucrose gradient protocol described previously by our laboratory (40Zwacka R.M. Zhang Y. Zhou W. Halldorson J. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The liver was placed in 2 ml of ice-cold nuclear homogenization buffer (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.74 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) and homogenized in a Wheaton 7-ml Dounce tissue grinder. Cushion buffer (the same as homogenization buffer, except containing 2.2 m sucrose) was added to the homogenized tissue to a final volume of 11 ml. This mixture was gently layered over 1 ml of cushion buffer in a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube, and then the tube was topped off with homogenization buffer. The sample was centrifuged at 104,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was gently resuspended in 0.1 ml of nuclear storage buffer (composed of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT). Isolated nuclei were either used for experiments immediately or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. In the latter case, the nuclei were thawed rapidly at 37 °C just before experiments and then kept on ice until use. The nuclei were quantitated by A260 and/or protein concentration to normalize quantities used in experiments. EPR was performed in the University of Iowa EPR Core Facility using a Bruker EPR spectrometer. Spin trapping experiments were done using 50 mm 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) at 25 °C unless otherwise specified. All of the EPR experiments were done in PBS, pH 7.4, with the metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (final concentration, 0.1 mm). When NADPH or NADH was added to nuclei, the samples were incubated for exactly 5 min at 22 °C prior to starting the EPR scans, unless otherwise indicated in the text. EPR parameters were as follows: center field, 3480 G; sweep width, 80 G; frequency, 9.78 GHz; power, 20.3 milliwatt; receiver gain, 5.02 × 104; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1 G; conversion time, 20.48 ms; time constant, 81.92 ms; sweep time, 20.972 s; number of scans, 15; resolution, 1024 points. EPR spectra were quantitated by measurement of peak-to-peak height of the second DMPO-OH line based on double integration and comparison with double-integrated 3-carboxyl proxyl standard spectra (41Venkataraman S. Martin S.M. Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For knockdown of G6PD, we produced five recombinant adenoviral vectors that expressed five independent shRNAs against mouse G6PD. The design of these shRNA sequences (Table 1) followed the principles described previously by Boudreau et al. (42Boudreau R.L. Monteys A.M. Davidson B.L. RNA. 2008; 14: 1834-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses expressing these shRNAs were produced and amplified using standard procedures (43Anderson R.D. Haskell R.E. Xia H. Roessler B.J. Davidson B.L. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). After screening each of the shRNAs in TIB-73 cells (an immortalized mouse hepatocyte cell line) for knockdown of G6PD protein, we selected viruses 4 and 5 (named Ad.shG6PD4 and Ad.shG6PD5) for further in vivo experiments. For knockdown of NOX4, we used a previously characterized recombinant adenoviral vector expressing shRNA against mouse NOX4 (Ad.shNOX4) (44Peterson J.R. Burmeister M.A. Tian X. Zhou Y. Guruju M.R.

For Western blotting of whole cells in culture, the lysates were prepared in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and Western blotted using standard protocols. All of the secondary antibodies were conjugated to infrared dyes, and imaging was performed using an Odyssey infrared detection system. Primary rabbit antibody against NOX4 was generated and characterized as reported previously (46Anilkumar N. Weber R. Zhang M. Brewer A. Shah A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and was used at a 1:2000 dilution. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories (catalog number A300-404A) and was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Antibodies against mtHSP70 (mitochondrial marker, ab53098) and GRP78Bip (lumenal endoplasmic reticulum marker, ab53068) were purchased from Abcam and were used at 1:300 dilution. To facilitate colocalization of NOX4 with G6PD in hepatic nuclei, it was necessary to generate an anti-NOX4 antibody in a species other than rabbit. We generated a chicken anti-mouse NOX4 antibody using an epitope that spans amino acids 214–274 of mouse NOX4. This region of NOX4 has no homology to other mouse NOX proteins. This sequence was cloned into Invitrogen pET151 vector to produce an amino-terminal His-V5-tagged fusion protein. We purified the fusion protein using a nickel FPLC column (GE Healthcare) followed by a second purification on a cobalt spin column (Thermo). This purified protein was sent to Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory (Canadensis, PA) and injected into chickens for polyclonal antibody production. Total IgY was purified from egg yolk; the anti-NOX4 antibody was then affinity-purified on an affinity column harboring the NOX4 fusion protein. For immunofluorescent detection of G6PD, a rabbit anti-G6PD primary antibody from Bethyl Laboratories was used (catalog number IHC-00007). The nuclei were incubated for 15 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in nuclear storage buffer and then diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 25% glycerol. The nuclei were then spun onto a glass slide using a Cytospin (1000 RPM, 3 min), and then the slides were washed twice in PBS. The slides were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min followed by three 5-min washes in PBS. The slides were incubated with blocking buffer (10% goat serum, 10% donkey serum, 2.4% BSA in PBS) for 20 min. The antibodies were diluted (affinity-purified chicken anti-NOX4 at 1:10; rabbit anti-G6PD at 1:50) in blocking buffer and applied to slides for 1 h. This was followed by three 5-min washes in blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken antibody and AlexaFluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody) were diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer and applied to the specimens for 1 h in the dark. This was followed by three 5-min washes in PBS, one wash in 0.01% Triton X-100, and one rinse in H2O. DAPI-containing antifadent (Vectashield H-1200; Vector Labs) was applied, and the slides were coverslipped immediately. The slides were imaged on a Leica spinning disk microscope. Fluorescent detection of O2⨪ production by isolated nuclei was performed using dihydroethidium (DHE), which reacts specifically with O2⨪ to form 2-hydroxyethidine (excitation/emission = 396/579 nm) and nonspecifically with numerous reactive oxygen species to form ethidium (excitation/emission = 510/580 nm) (47Robinson K.M. Janes M.S. Pehar M. Monette J.S. Ross M.F. Hagen T.M. Murphy M.P. Beckman J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15038-15043Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 48Zhao H. Joseph J.

Intact, unfixed nuclei suspended in PBS containing DHE and NADPH were quickly pipetted directly onto slides and were imaged with a Bio-Rad Radience 2100MP confocal multiphoton microscope 10 min after initiating the reaction for detection of 2-hydroxyethidine or with a Texas Red filter in a Leica spinning disk microscope for detection of ethidium. Isolated nuclei were fixed in a solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer. The samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min and washed. They were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentrations, embedded in resin, and sectioned. The sections were evaluated using a Jeol JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope. Immunogold labeling for NOX4 was performed on nuclei cytospun onto glass slides and prestained with rabbit anti-NOX4 antibody, FITC-conjugated secondary antibody, and 10 nm-gold labeled anti-FITC tertiary antibody. This protocol allowed for immunofluorescence microscopy to be performed prior to TEM sample preparation. The nuclei were then directly embedded into Epon on the glass slide and sectioned for TEM. Using a sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation protocol, we isolated highly pure mouse liver nuclei that retained both membrane layers of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1A). These preparations were devoid of mitochondrial contamination, as evidenced both by electron microscopy (Fig. 1A) and by Western blotting for the mitochondrial-specific marker mtHSP70 (Fig. 1B). Similar studies were performed using the lumenal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker GRP78Bip. As anticipated, because the ER lumen is contiguous with the lumen of the nuclear envelope, GRP78Bip was observed in isolated nuclei (Fig. 1B). Nuclei treated with NADPH (0.1 mm) produced significant ROS, as determined by EPR using DMPO spin trapping (Fig. 1C), in agreement with early findings (8Patton S.E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 18: 588-593PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous studies have suggested that NADH is the preferred substrate for nuclear ROS production in umbilical vein endothelial nuclei (11Kuroda J. Nakagawa K. Yamasaki T. Nakamura K. Takeya R. Kuribayashi F. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Igarashi K. Shibata Y. Sueishi K. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we found that NADH could not serve as a substrate for hepatic nuclear ROS production (Fig. 1D). Thus, hepatic nuclear ROS production specifically requires NADPH. To determine whether the DMPO-OH EPR signal generated by isolated nuclei in the presence of NADPH resulted from O2⨪, we performed several studies with O2⨪ scavengers. We observed that the addition of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) at 3000 units/ml removed more than half of the NADPH-dependent ROS produced by intact isolated hepatic nuclei (Fig. 1D). Therefore, O2⨪ accounts for at least half of the ROS signal. However, the fact that almost half of the DMPO-OH signal remained after SOD1 addition suggested several possibilities. One possible explanation of this finding is that O2⨪ is not the only ROS produced in our nuclei and detectable as DMPO-OH (for example, it is conceivable that hydroxyl radicals are formed without O2⨪ as an intermediate). However, the nucleus is a very complex double-membrane-bound structure, and SOD1 is a membrane-impermeable enzyme. Thus, an alternative explanation could be that SOD1 has access to only some of the O2⨪ molecules made by the nuclei, with the remaining O2⨪ unavailable to SOD1 at intact compartmentalized locations. To test for the possibility of compartmentalization of O2⨪ production by nuclei, we analyzed the ability of the membrane-permeable superoxide scavengers Tiron and MnTBAP to decrease the DMPO-OH EPR signal.

The MST1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated upon apoptotic stimulation, which in turn activates its downstream targets, JNK/p38, histone H2B and FOXO. It has been reported that overexpression of MST1 initiates apoptosis by activating p53. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying MST1-p53 signaling during apoptosis are unclear. Here, we report that MST1 promotes genotoxic agent-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. We found that MST1 increases p53 acetylation and transactivation by inhibiting the deacetylation of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and its interaction with p53 and that Sirt1 can be phosphorylated by MST1 leading to the inhibition of Sirt1 activity. Collectively, these findings define a novel regulatory mechanism involving the phosphorylation of Sirt1 by MST1 kinase which leads to p53 activation, with implications for our understanding of signaling mechanisms during DNA damage-induced apoptosis."

The mechanism for the cell type-dependent survival function of ATF5 is unknown. We report here that the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2 is a downstream target of ATF5 that mediates the prosurvival function of ATF5 in C6 glioma cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. ATF5 binds to an ATF5-specific regulatory element that is downstream of and adjacent to the negative regulatory element in the BCL-2 P2 promoter, stimulating BCL-2 expression. Highlighting the critical role of BCL-2 in ATF5-dependent cancer cell survival, expression of BCL-2 blocks death of C6 and MCF-7 cells induced by dominant-negative ATF5, and depletion of BCL-2 impairs ATF5-promoted cell survival. Moreover, we found that BCL-2 expression is not regulated by ATF5 in non-transformed rat astrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human breast epithelial cells, where expression of BCL-2 but not ATF5 is required for cell survival. These findings identify BCL-2 as an essential mediator for the cancer-specific cell survival function of ATF5 in glioblastoma and breast cancer cells and provide direct evidence that the cell type-specific function of ATF5 derives from differential regulation of downstream targets by ATF5 in different types of cells."

Here we investigated the upstream mechanisms of ERK/GEF-H1 activation. Surprisingly, TNF-α-induced ERK and RhoA stimulation in tubular cells were prevented by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition or silencing. TNF-α also enhanced phosphorylation of the EGFR. EGF treatment mimicked the effects of TNF-α, as it elicited potent, ERK-dependent GEF-H1 and RhoA activation. Moreover, EGF-induced RhoA activation was prevented by GEF-H1 silencing, indicating that GEF-H1 is a key downstream effector of the EGFR. The TNF-α-elicited EGFR, ERK, and RhoA stimulation were mediated by the TNF-α convertase enzyme (TACE) that can release EGFR ligands. Further, EGFR transactivation also required the tyrosine kinase Src, as Src inhibition prevented TNF-α-induced activation of the EGFR/ERK/GEF-H1/RhoA pathway. Importantly, a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and electric cell substrate impedance-sensing (ECIS) measurements revealed that TNF-α stimulated cell growth in an EGFR-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W1973154344,"Cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) is responsible for the bulk of the uptake of cationic amino acids in most mammalian cells. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to down-regulation of the cell surface CAT-1. To examine the mechanisms of PKC-induced down-regulation of CAT-1, a functional mutant of CAT-1 (CAT-1-HA-GFP) was generated in which a hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope tag was introduced into the second extracellular loop and GFP was attached to the carboxyl terminus. CAT-1-HA-GFP was stably expressed in porcine aorthic endothelial and human epithelial kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Using the HA antibody internalization assay we have demonstrated that PKC-dependent endocytosis was strongly inhibited by siRNA depletion of clathrin heavy chain, indicating that CAT-1-HA-GFP internalization requires clathrin-coated pits. Internalized CAT-1-HA-GFP was accumulated in early, recycling, and late endosomes. PKC activation also resulted in ubiquitination of CAT-1. CAT-1 ubiquitination and endocytosis in phorbol ester-stimulated porcine aorthic endothelial and HEK293 cells were inhibited by siRNA knockdown of NEDD4-2 and NEDD4-1 E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. In contrast, ubiquitination and endocytosis of the dopamine transporter was dependent on NEDD4-2 in all cell types tested. Altogether, our data suggest that ubiquitination mediated by NEDD4-2 or NEDD4-1 leading to clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the common mode of regulation of various transporter proteins by PKC."
https://openalex.org/W2015830320,"The B-DNA major and minor groove dimensions are crucial for DNA-protein interactions. It has long been thought that the groove dimensions depend on the DNA sequence, however this relationship has remained elusive. Here, our aim is to elucidate how the DNA sequence intrinsically shapes the grooves.The present study is based on the analysis of datasets of free and protein-bound DNA crystal structures, and from a compilation of NMR (31)P chemical shifts measured on free DNA in solution on a broad range of representative sequences. The (31)P chemical shifts can be interpreted in terms of the BI↔BII backbone conformations and dynamics. The grooves width and depth of free and protein-bound DNA are found to be clearly related to the BI/BII backbone conformational states. The DNA propensity to undergo BI↔BII backbone transitions is highly sequence-dependent and can be quantified at the dinucleotide level. This dual relationship, between DNA sequence and backbone behavior on one hand, and backbone behavior and groove dimensions on the other hand, allows to decipher the link between DNA sequence and groove dimensions. It also firmly establishes that proteins take advantage of the intrinsic DNA groove properties.The study provides a general framework explaining how the DNA sequence shapes the groove dimensions in free and protein-bound DNA, with far-reaching implications for DNA-protein indirect readout in both specific and non specific interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1997124000,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease characterized by the presence of anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies in the patient sera. We recently reported that these autoantibodies are able to bind AQP4 when organized in the supramolecular structure called the orthogonal array of particles (OAP). To map the antigenic determinants, we produced a series of AQP4 mutants based on multiple alignment sequence analysis between AQP4 and other OAP-forming AQPs. Mutations were introduced in the three extracellular loops (A, C, and E), and the binding capacity of NMO sera was tested on AQP4 mutants. Results indicate that one group of sera was able to recognize a limited portion of loop C containing the amino acid sequence 146GVT(T/M)V150. A second group of sera was characterized by a predominant role of loop A. Deletion of four AQP4-specific amino acids (61G(S/T)E(N/K)64) in loop A substantially affected the binding of this group of sera. However, the binding capacity was further reduced when amino acids in loop A were mutated together with those in loop E or when those in loop C were mutated in combination with loop E. Finally, a series of AQP0 mutants were produced in which the extracellular loops were progressively changed to make them identical to AQP4. Results showed that none of the mutants was able to reproduce in AQP0 the NMO-IgG epitopes, indicating that the extracellular loop sequence by itself was not sufficient to determine the rearrangement required to create the epitopes. Although our data highlight the complexity of the disease, this study identifies key immunodominant epitopes and provides direct evidence that the transition from AQP4 tetramers to AQP4-OAPs involves conformational changes of the extracellular loops. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease characterized by the presence of anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies in the patient sera. We recently reported that these autoantibodies are able to bind AQP4 when organized in the supramolecular structure called the orthogonal array of particles (OAP). To map the antigenic determinants, we produced a series of AQP4 mutants based on multiple alignment sequence analysis between AQP4 and other OAP-forming AQPs. Mutations were introduced in the three extracellular loops (A, C, and E), and the binding capacity of NMO sera was tested on AQP4 mutants. Results indicate that one group of sera was able to recognize a limited portion of loop C containing the amino acid sequence 146GVT(T/M)V150. A second group of sera was characterized by a predominant role of loop A. Deletion of four AQP4-specific amino acids (61G(S/T)E(N/K)64) in loop A substantially affected the binding of this group of sera. However, the binding capacity was further reduced when amino acids in loop A were mutated together with those in loop E or when those in loop C were mutated in combination with loop E. Finally, a series of AQP0 mutants were produced in which the extracellular loops were progressively changed to make them identical to AQP4. Results showed that none of the mutants was able to reproduce in AQP0 the NMO-IgG epitopes, indicating that the extracellular loop sequence by itself was not sufficient to determine the rearrangement required to create the epitopes. Although our data highlight the complexity of the disease, this study identifies key immunodominant epitopes and provides direct evidence that the transition from AQP4 tetramers to AQP4-OAPs involves conformational changes of the extracellular loops.

Autoantibodies against AQP4 (IgG) are found in about 75% of NMO patients, together with other autoantibodies for other proteins, including anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, anti-myelin basic protein, anti-S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100β), anti-cleavage polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF-73), and anti-RING finger protein 141 (RNF-141) (2Lennon V.A.

Anti-AQP4 IgG may act through the activation of multiple potentially neuropathogenic mechanisms contributing to injury to astrocytes and to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. These mechanisms include AQP4 internalization, an alteration of water and glutamate homeostasis, activation of antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and complement activation (14Saikali P.

The exact causes of the NMO pathogenesis are still unknown, but many hypotheses have been advanced. Bacterial or viral infections are believed to damage AQP4-expressing tissues and subsequently activate the autoimmune disease or that infection and autoimmunity may damage the blood-brain barrier and allow B and T cells to access the central nervous system (CNS).One of the most intriguing questions regarding the pathogenesis of NMO is as follows. Why aren't all the AQP4-expressing tissues damaged in the NMO? Only the optic nerves, the spinal cord, and to a lesser extent the brain are mostly affected. The answer might lie in the molecular structure of the NMO-IgG epitope whose identification might lead to new insight into the pathogenic mechanism of the NMO IgG and contribute to the development of a specific therapy.Until now, there are very few studies on this topic. A computational study predicts a conformational B cell epitope targeting the exposed AQP4 extracellular loops (13Graber D.J. Levy M. Kerr D. Wade W.F. J. Neuroinflammation. 2008; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The recent human AQP4 crystal structure (18Ho J.D. Yeh R. Sandstrom A. Chorny I. Harries W.E. Robbins R.A. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7437-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) confirms this prediction and indicates that the flexibility of loop C is the most important structural characteristic of AQP4 that could have an important role in the NMO phatogenesis.We have recently shown that the NMO-IgG selectively recognizes AQP4 only when organized in the plasma membrane to form supramolecular structures of AQP4 aggregates, called orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs). NMO-IgGs are able to bind cells transfected with the OAP-forming M23 isoform of AQP4 but do not bind cells expressing only the M1 isoform, which is unable to form OAPs by itself (19Nicchia G.P. Mastrototaro M. Rossi A. Pisani F. Tortorella C. Ruggieri M. Lia A. Trojano M. Frigeri A. Svelto M. Glia. 2009; 57: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Rossi A. Pisani F. Nicchia G.P. Svelto M. Frigeri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4562-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NMO-IgGs are not able to bind the other two known OAP-forming AQPs such as the lens-aquaporin 0 (AQP0) and the insect AQPcic (19Nicchia G.P. Mastrototaro M. Rossi A. Pisani F. Tortorella C. Ruggieri M. Lia A. Trojano M. Frigeri A. Svelto M. Glia. 2009; 57: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Le Cahérec F. Bron P. Verbavatz J.M. Garret A. Morel G. Cavalier A. Bonnec G. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the epitope for NMO-IgG is specific for AQP4-OAPs.The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular structure of the NMO-IgG epitope by generating a series of AQP4 mutants based on multiple alignment sequence analysis between AQP4 and other OAPs forming AQPs (AQP0 and AQPcic). Eleven NMO IgG sera were tested for their capability to bind these mutants. These sera recognized both human and rat AQP4.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used sera collected from Italian patients diagnosed with NMO. Eleven NMO sera were previously identified to recognize AQP4 in both brain tissue and transfected cells, and with these sera we performed this study. Using fluorescently tagged AQP4, we confirmed that the epitope was generated when AQP4-M23 organizes in OAPs. Indeed, if the fluorescent tag was added to the N terminus of M23-AQP4, the OAPs assembly was affected, and none of the 11 sera was able to bind AQP4, although if the fluorescent tag was added to the C terminus of M23-AQP4, then OAP formation was not affected, and all the sera were able to recognize AQP4. It is likely that the NMO binding involves new interactions occurring between the extracellular loops of the AQP4 tetramers when they assemble in a supramolecular organization. This suggests that OAPs formation, which occurs by lateral interaction between tetramers (22Hiroaki Y. Tani K. Kamegawa A. Gyobu N. Nishikawa K. Suzuki H. Walz T. Sasaki S. Mitsuoka K. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), determines new extracellular surface interactions that involve the loops A, C, and E (Fig. 6).Here, we used mutagenesis to identify which portions of the extracellular loops were involved in binding the NMO-IgG. The study was conducted with the rat AQP4 sequence with the idea that the information obtained would be useful for the generation of a suitable animal model of the NMO. However, some results were verified using the human AQP4 mutants.From the immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation results, we can conclude that a group of sera (NMO-2) was able to recognize a specific portion of loop C (CA). This G146–150 region corresponds to the tip of the loop C. Because all the other mutants did not significantly affect the binding capacity of the NMO-2 group, it suggests that the NMO-2 epitope is generated by pair associations, among tetramers, of loop C (see Fig. 6).The second group of sera (NMO-1) was characterized by a predominant role of loop A. The deletion of the four AQP4-specific amino acids (Δ61–64) substantially affected the binding of this group of sera (see Table 2). However, the increased reduction in binding when the deletion of loop A is combined with loop E and the reduction found when loop Cb and loop E are mutated simultaneously suggest that the binding epitope for this group of sera is generated and/or stabilized by interaction of the extracellular loop (see Fig. 6). This epitope could be conformational as the extracellular AQP4 tetramer surface area of 35 × 30 Å2 is compatible with a conformational epitope formed by the contribution of different extracellular loops (13Graber D.J. Levy M. Kerr D. Wade W.F. J. Neuroinflammation. 2008; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The group 3, which included only two sera, was characterized by a generic reduction of the binding capacity in all the mutants that we have generated. This may be linked to the poor specificity of the sera or to an intermediate situation between group 1 and 2, but because of the scarcity of the sera, additional studies are warranted.Two papers related to this topic have been published. Marnetto et al. (23Marnetto F. Hellias B. Granieri L. Frau J. Patanella A.K. Nytrova P. Sala A. Capobianco M. Gilli F. Bertolotto A. J. Neuroimmunol. 2009; 217: 74-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), based on Western blot results, suggested that the AQP4 epitope could be linear and localized in the M1 isoform, even though this conclusion is based on the use of anti-AQP4 antibodies recognizing the C terminus of AQP4 protein, which is common between M1 and M23 isoforms. In another recent study (24Tani T. Sakimura K. Tsujita M. Nakada T. Tanaka M. Nishizawa M. Tanaka K. J. Neuroimmunol. 2009; 211: 110-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), AQP4 mutants were generated based on the selective binding of the NMO sera to the human and not to the mouse form of AQP4. Using this strategy, the authors found that the major epitope of NMO-IgG is located at loop E of human AQP4. This is only partially in agreement with our results, which demonstrate that the E loop is involved with the other loops only in one category of sera. These differences may be linked to different polyclonal autoantibodies produced by Italian compared with Japanese patients or to an incomplete analysis of the complementary role of the three external loops. In support of this last possibility, the authors were not able to explain why a single amino acid substitution (A228E) in the mouse AQP4 (introducing the same amino acid of the human form) determined the recognition of their NMO sera, whereas the reciprocal human mutant E228A did not show any decrease in staining as to mouse AQP4 level. This may be explained by the involvement of other loops in the formation of the conformational epitope. Moreover, it is important to note that all our sera displayed cross-reactivity with rat and mouse AQP4.Our data demonstrate a role of the three extracellular loops in the formation of the NMO-IgG epitope. How these loops associate and generate the epitopes for the A and B groups of sera can only be speculated at this moment. The crystal structure obtained by Ho et al. (18Ho J.D. Yeh R. Sandstrom A. Chorny I. Harries W.E. Robbins R.A. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7437-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) does not provide sufficient resolution to identify amino acids involved in lateral and/or superficial interactions. From electron crystallography of double-layered, two-dimensional crystals, Hiroaki et al. (22Hiroaki Y. Tani K. Kamegawa A. Gyobu N. Nishikawa K. Suzuki H. Walz T. Sasaki S. Mitsuoka K. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) reported a superficial interaction that involves the Gly157 of the C loop with Trp231 at the end of the E loop, which generates from two adjacent tetramers that may be engaged in the NMO-IgG epitope. We tested this hypothesis using a W231E mutant and found no effect on the interaction with the NMO sera (data not shown), indicating that this interaction is not involved in the epitope formation and, because Gly157 is conserved among other AQPs, probably it is not essential in the OAP formation.To obtain additional information on the generation of these conformational epitopes, a series of AQP0 mutants was produced in which the extracellular loops were progressively mutated to make them identical to AQP4. None of the mutants was able to reproduce in AQP0 the NMO-IgG epitopes, indicating that the extracellular loops sequence per se is not sufficient to determine the rearrangement required to create the epitopes. One possibility to explain this result could be that the AQP0 tetramers are not sufficiently close to each other to generate OAPs of the same type as those generated by AQP4 tetramers, which are necessary to allow the interaction between loops of different tetramers. This possibility is corroborated by the analysis of two-dimensional AQP0 crystals in which the tetramers have basically no direct lateral interaction due to the presence of lipids that bridge all the contacts between tetramers (25Harries W.E. Akhavan D. Miercke L.J. Khademi S. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AQP4 crystallography data (22Hiroaki Y. Tani K. Kamegawa A. Gyobu N. Nishikawa K. Suzuki H. Walz T. Sasaki S. Mitsuoka K. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and mutational studies (26Crane J.M. Van Hoek A.N. Skach W.R. Verkman A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) point to the important contribution of amino acids in the transmembrane segments and in the N terminus in the lateral interaction between tetramers necessary for AQP4-OAPs formation.Our result provides strong evidence that the NMO-IgG epitope is not linear or within the monomer or the tetramer of AQP4. The epitope complexity could be one of the reasons why, to date, there are no NMO animal models using a linear peptide injection. Graber et al. (13Graber D.J. Levy M. Kerr D. Wade W.F. J. Neuroinflammation. 2008; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have recently tried to create an NMO animal model by injecting AQP4 linear peptides of the loop E (206–231) and C (272–291). These animals possessed high antibody titers able to bind the M1 and M23 isoforms, but they failed to induce any specific NMO symptoms.The NMO-IgG epitope complexity may also explain why the disease affects some tissues but not others. Classically, NMO targets the optic nerves, the spinal cord, and to a lesser extent the brain. However, AQP4 is expressed also in other tissues such as kidney and skeletal muscle, tissues that do not appear to be affected in NMO patients. An explanation of why the primary target of NMO-IgG is the optic nerve can be related to its more permissive blood-brain barrier to serum proteins. However, it is also possible that tissue-specific structural differences in OAPs may also be involved.In conclusion our data indicate that the NMO-IgG autoantibodies have a polyclonal origin and that the three AQP4 extracellular loops (A, C, and E) participate in the formation of the NMO-IgG epitope. These three loops likely change their conformation when AQP4 arrange into OAPs and create at least two different epitopes. The first is generated from the specific sequence present in AQP4 A loop (61–64), and the second by the involvement of the more superficial part of the C loop (CA) of adjacent tetramers.This study identifies key immunodominant epitopes and provides crucial information to produce an efficient NMO disease model for the development of therapy for NMO. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the transition from AQP4 tetramers to AQP4-OAPs involves conformational changes of the extracellular loops that, together with lateral interaction, may contribute to formation and/or stabilization of OAPs.

Interestingly, NMO-IgGs are not able to bind the other two known OAP-forming AQPs such as the lens-aquaporin 0 (AQP0) and the insect AQPcic (19Nicchia G.P. Mastrototaro M. Rossi A. Pisani F.

Eleven NMO IgG sera were tested for their capability to bind these mutants. These sera recognized both human and rat AQP4."
https://openalex.org/W2147533489,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human γ-herpesvirus associated with several human malignancies. The replication and transcription activator (RTA) is necessary and sufficient for the switch from KSHV latency to lytic replication. Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing β-interferon (TRIF, also called TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 (TICAM-1)) is a signaling adaptor molecule that is critically involved in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and TLR-4 signaling pathways for type I interferon (IFN) production, a key component of innate immunity against microbial infection. In this report, we find a new mechanism by which RTA blocks innate immunity by targeting cellular TRIF. RTA specifically degrades TRIF by shortening the half-life of TRIF protein. This RTA-mediated degradation is at least partially mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway because proteasome inhibitors as well as knockdown of cellular ubiquitin expression alleviate the degradation. RTA may not directly interact with TRIF and may activate TRIF degradation indirectly through an unknown mediator(s). RTA targets multiple regions of TRIF and may use its ubiquitin ligase domain for the degradation. In addition, physiological levels of TRIF protein are down-regulated during KSHV lytic replication when RTA is expressed. Finally, RTA down-regulates double-stranded RNA-initiated activation of TLR-3 pathway, in the absence of degradation of IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7). Taken together, these data suggest that KSHV employs a novel mechanism to block the innate immunity by degrading TRIF protein. This work may contribute to our understandings on how KSHV evades host immunity for its survival in vivo.

As with other herpesviruses, KSHV goes through both latency and lytic replication cycles. The expression of the KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA) is necessary and sufficient for the switch from latency to lytic replication (4West J.T. Wood C.

RTA also interacts with other factors to modulate its transcription potential, such as with cellular recombination signal sequence-binding protein-Jκ (RBP-Jκ) (14Liang Y. Chang J. Lynch S.J. Lukac D.M. Ganem D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15Liang Y. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2006; 80: 9697-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RTA also modulates cellular activities through protein degradation. The proteasome is a multicomponent macromolecule that is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and works as a cellular machinery for degradation of proteins (17Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu Rev Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The proteasome degradation is usually ubiquitin-dependent involving ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and ubiquitin ligase E3 (17Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu Rev Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 18Ciechanover A.

RTA was first documented as an E3 ligase for degradation of a cellular interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two more cellular proteins, K-RBP and Hey, both are repressors of KSHV lytic replication and have been identified as targets for degradation by RTA with the same pathway (21Gould F. Harrison S.M. Hewitt E.W. Whitehouse A. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 6727-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Yang Z. Yan Z. Wood C. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3590-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The host innate immune system is essential for the initial detection of invading viruses and subsequent activation of adaptive immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors. TLRs are able to recognize molecular patterns unique to pathogens and activate host innate immunity against the pathogen (23Kawai T. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 24Takeda K. Akira S. Coligan J.E. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2007Google Scholar). One of the major products from TLR activation is the production of type I interferons (IFN). IFN is a key component to mount a proper and robust immune response to a viral infection (25Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 26Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF), also called TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule-1(TICAM-1), is an adaptor protein that is involved in the signaling transduction during the activation of some TLRs, leading to activation of NF-κB and type I IFN (27Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 28Yamamoto M. Sato S.

TLR-3 and TLR-4 seem to be dependent on TRIF for their downstream cascades (27Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). Because TRIF is critically involved in TLR and IFN production, it would be a natural strategy for viruses to nullify TRIF for their own benefit. Vaccinia virus encodes two genes to differentially affect TRIF signaling (30Stack J. Haga I.R. Schröder M. Bartlett N.W. Maloney G. Reading P.C. Fitzgerald K.A. Smith G.L. Bowie A.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 31Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Also, hepatitis C virus encodes a viral protease that cleaves TRIF (32Li K. Foy E. Ferreon J.C. Nakamura M. Ferreon A.C. Ikeda M. Ray S.C. Gale Jr., M. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2992-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same viral protease also digests another gene critically involved in IFN production (33Li X.D. Sun L. Seth R.B. Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17717-17722Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). IFN inhibits the KSHV replication in vitro (34Krug L.T. Pozharskaya V.P. Yu Y. Inoue N. Offermann M.K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8359-8371Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Monini P. Carlini F. Stürzl M. Rimessi P. Superti F. Franco M. Melucci-Vigo G. Cafaro A. Goletti D. Sgadari C. Butto' S.

TLR-4 has been identified as an important molecule against KSHV infection, and KSHV has developed a mechanism to rapid suppression of TLR-4 expression (37Lagos D. Vart R.J. Gratrix F. Westrop S.J. Emuss V. Wong P.P. Robey R. Imami N. Bower M. Gotch F. Boshoff C. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 470-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Also, murine γ-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is another herpesvirus with significant similarities to KSHV. Activation of the TLR-3/TLR-4 pathway potently inhibits the replication of MHV68 in vivo (38Doyle S. Vaidya S. O'Connell R. Dadgostar H. Dempsey P. Wu T. Rao G. Sun R. Haberland M. Modlin R. Cheng G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). At the same time, KSHVs have a segment genomic DNA and protein product (K8.1) that induce the production of IFNs (39Sanchez D.J. Miranda Jr., D. Arumugaswami V. Hwang S. Singer A.E. Senaati A. Shahangian A. Song M.J. Sun R. Cheng G. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2208-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40Perry S.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11105-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). KSHV infects many cell types, including B lymphocytes and dendritic cells (41Rappocciolo G. Hensler H.R. Jais M. Reinhart T.A. Pegu A. Jenkins F.J. Rinaldo C.R. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4793-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Rappocciolo G. Jenkins F.J. Hensler H.R. Piazza P. Jais M. Borowski L. Watkins S.C.

Lett. 2007; 113: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These cells express multiple TLRs, and dendritic cells are potent IFN producers. Thus, a successful counteraction of IFN activation may be a necessity for the survival of KSHV in vivo. KSHV encodes several genes to counteract the innate IFN response. IRF-7 was first cloned in the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency (45Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and is a master gene for IFN production (46Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). KSHV employs two mechanisms to nullify the function of IRF-7; RTA mediates IRF-7 degradation in certain cell lines (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and ORF45 blocks the activation of IRF-7 to impair IFN production (47Zhu F.X. King S.M. Smith E.J. Levy D.E. Yuan Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is able to block the activation of TBK1-mediated activation of IRF-3 (48Cloutier N. Flamand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7208-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). KSHV encodes several viral homologs of the IRF family of transcription factors (vIRF). vIRF1, vIRF2, and vIRF3 are all able to block the production of IFNs by functioning as dominant negative versions of cellular IRFs (4West J.T. Wood C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5150-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Dourmishev L.A. Dourmishev A.L. Palmeri D. Schwartz R.A. Lukac D.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 175-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KSHV ORF10 is also able to block the IFN signaling in KSHV-infected cells (49Bisson S.A. Page A.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 5056-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have found a cell line in which IRF-7 could not be degraded by RTA. However, IFN production was still inhibited by RTA as reported previously (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We have examined the mechanism of this IRF-7 degradation-independent IFN inhibition and found that RTA degrades cellular TRIF protein, an upstream adaptor protein involved in IFN production. This report provides another mechanism by which KSHV nullifies host innate immunity. Expression plasmids of KSHV RTA and its mutant (RTA-K152E), EBV RTA, IRF-7, pcDNA3.1-Myc-TRIF, and p56-luc (561-pGL3 luciferase reporter construct) are as described previously (45Zhang L. Pagano J.S.

Ubiquitin-expressing plasmid was a gift from Dr. Clinton Jones. The mutagenesis to generate a mutant with deletion (amino acids 318–514; TRIF-Del) was done by the use of PCR site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). The TRIF-N (amino acids 1–514) and TRIF-C (amino acids 318–712) were done with the use of PCR and cloned into 3×-FLAG vector (Sigma). The expression clones were all sequenced to verify the validity of the clones. IRF-7 antibody was as described previously (45Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell.

The antibodies for Myc (SC-40), IRF-1 (SC-497), ubiquitin (SC-9133), and GAPDH (SC-47724) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TRIF antibody was from Cell Signaling (catalog number 4596). siRNA to ubiquitin (siUb) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-29513), and siLuc was from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon (D-002050-01-05). 293T is a human fibroblast line. WT11(clone 9) is a TLR-3-expressing cell line (56Sarkar S.N. Smith H.L. Rowe T.M. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

Both cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubation. 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was used to maintain the TLR-3 expression in WT11 cells. IB4 is a KSHV-negative but EBV-positive cell line. BCBL1 is a KSHV-positive primary effusion lymphoma line. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS. Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used for the transfection of 293T or WT11-9 cell lines following the manufacturer's recommendation. Proteasome inhibitors were as follows; lactacystin (80052-806) was from VWR International and used at the 1–10 μm range, and MG132 (HPK-116) was purchased from Assay Designs and used at 1–10 mm. For lactacystin and MG132 treatment, cells were transfected, and medium were removed 4–6 h after transfection. Fresh medium plus proper concentrations of drugs were added. Cells were collected 12–24 h later. Poly(I-C) (double-stranded RNA) was purchased from InvivoGen (tlrl-pic) and used at 10 μg/ml. Luciferase assays were performed using the assay kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's recommendation. β-Galactosidase assays were also performed for transfection efficiency. Data were averaged from the triplicates. Protein biosynthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, was purchased from Sigma (C4859) and used at 50–100 μg/ml. Cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes, and transfected cells were split 4–6 h after transfection into a 6-well plate. On the next day, the cells were treated with cycloheximide for the indicated period, and cell lysates were made and used for Western blot analysis.

Sometimes, gradient temperatures were performed for RPA when difficulties in RPA were encountered (60Zhang L. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 14: 73-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GAPDH probe was from United States Biochemicals, Inc. The probe for IFN-β was a gift from Dr. Ganes Sen. RTA has been shown to degrade cellular IRF-7 for the blockage of IFN production (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We have examined whether RTA could degrade IRF-7 extensively and found that RTA was unable to degrade IRF-7 in the cell line we used (293T) (Fig. 1A). Because RTA blocks the production of IFN, this particular line is therefore very useful to examine the role of IRF-7 in RTA-mediated IFN production. IRF-7 was transfected with or without RTA, and the cells were infected by Sendai virus. As shown in Fig. 1B, endogenous IFN-β production was greatly enhanced with IRF-7 expression. However, with the expression of KSHV RTA, the IFN production was drastically reduced. The use of IFN-β as a marker for type I IFN production is well established and appreciated in the field. Because in our experimental system there was no apparent IRF-7 degradation, even after the 6-h Sendai infection (Fig. 1A and data not shown), the data suggest that KSHV RTA has an additional mechanism(s), other than degradation of IRF-7, for the blockage of IFN production. The data in Fig. 1 suggested that RTA blocks transcription of IFN by targeting a different protein involved in the innate immune response. We thus examined several intermediates involved in IFN induction for putative RTA targets, such as TRIF and RIG-I. 293T cells were co-transfected with target gene and RTA expression plasmids, and 1 day later, the cell lysates were used to examine the target gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that TRIF protein was reduced in the presence of RTA. This reduction seems to be specific for KSHV RTA as EBV RTA (E-RTA) could not reduce the expression of TRIF at the level expressed (Fig. 2B). EBV RTA and KSHV RTA have significant homologies, and both viruses are γ-herpesvirus. We further examined whether TRIF RNA levels were reduced when RTA was present. The semiquantitative RT-PCR results indicated that TRIF RNA was not obviously affected by RTA expression (data not shown). Thus, the data suggest that RTA may reduce TRIF protein expression to block IFN production. To test whether RTA can alter TRIF protein stability, 293T cells were transfected with TRIF, with or without RTA expression plasmid. 1 day later, cells were treated with cycloheximide for blockage of protein synthesis. Cell lysates were made at various time points after the drug treatment. As shown in Fig. 3, the TRIF protein was quite stable at 7 h after treatment. However, the half-life of TRIF was reduced in the presence of RTA (Fig. 3B). The half-life of IRF-1 protein was also examined and was short as expected (61Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These results indicated that RTA reduced TRIF expression by altering protein stability. To determine the region of RTA to promote the degradation of TRIF, an RTA mutant (RTA-K152E) was used. This mutant cannot induce the lytic replication of KSHV (50Zhang J. Wang J. Wood C. Xu D. Zhang L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5640-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 62Papugani A. Coleman T. Jones C. Zhang L. Virus Res. 2008; 131: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and fails to induce the degradation of K-RBP (22Yang Z. Yan Z. Wood C. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3590-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of TRIF was significantly reduced in cells transfected with RTA; however, TRIF expression was partially restored in the cells transfected with RTA-K152E. The region (amino acids 118–207; Cys/His-rich domain) was shown to be the putative domain as E3 ligase for IRF-7 and other proteins (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 22Yang Z. Yan Z. Wood C. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3590-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutation (K152E) is within the putative E3 ligase domain. To narrow down the region(s) of TRIF for RTA-mediated degradation, we have made several mutants as shown in Fig. 5A. The TRIF-Del was made to remove the majority of the TIR domain in TRIF. The TIR domain is a signature and used for interaction with other proteins in TLR signaling. The deletion mutant was transfected into 293T cells, and whether RTA degrades the TRIF mutant was examined. As shown in Fig. 5B, the TIR deletion TRIF was degraded by RTA. Next, we made mutants containing the N or C terminus of TRIF and the TIR domain. As shown in Fig. 5C, both TRIF-N and TRIF-C were degraded in the presence of RTA. However, the RTA-K152E mutant marginally degraded the proteins. The RTA mutant also failed to degrade TRIF-Del (data not shown). These data suggest that the RTA targets multiple regions of TRIF for degradation. RTA has been shown to degrade several proteins through the proteasome pathway (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 22Yang Z. Yan Z. Wood C. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3590-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To address whether TRIF is also degraded through the proteasome, we first used the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. As shown in Fig. 6A, lactacystin partially restored the expression of TRIF. Another proteasome inhibitor, MG132, also partially restored the TRIF protein expression (data not shown). Second, we used siUb to knock down the endogenous ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 6B, siUb could partially restore the expression of TRIF, but siRNA for luciferase (siLuc) failed to do so. The expression of ubiquitin was reduced in the presence of siUb (Fig. 6B). Finally, whether ubiquitin could be added to the TRIF molecule and increase its molecular weight was examined. However, we could not detect any slowly migrating, high molecular weight TRIF present under our experimental conditions (data not shown). It is possible that the TRIF molecule might be too large, and the addition of limited ubiquitin molecule might not be as obvious for observation. We then tested whether the ubiquitination could be observed in the TRIF-C as it is relatively small in molecular weight. As shown in Fig. 6C, in the presence of RTA, a slowly migrating, high molecular weight smear of TRIF-C, was observed (Fig. 6C, lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, increased levels of TRIF-C smears were observable when ubiquitin-expressing plasmid was co-transfected (lanes 3 and 4). The expression of ubiquitin was confirmed (data not shown). These data provided evidence that RTA, at least partially, promoted TRIF degradation via the proteasome pathway. To examine whether RTA could degrade TRIF under physiological conditions, we induced the lytic replication process in the KSHV latently infected BCBL cell line. RTA is not expressed during the viral latency, but it is a key mediator for the lytic replication. When KSHV-positive BCBL1 cells were treated with sodium butyrate, the expression of RTA was significantly increased (Fig. 7A). In addition, a simultaneous down-regulation of endogenous TRIF expression was observed. The same lysates were also used for the detection of IRF-7, and the expression of IRF-7 was increased with the sodium butyrate treatment, which is in a agreement with a previous report (63Poole L.J. Yu Y. Kim P.S. Zheng Q.Z. Pevsner J. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3395-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 64Zhang L. Wu L. Hong K. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12393-12401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we tested whether TRIF was degraded in KSHV-negative cell lines. IB4 is an EBV-transformed cell line with no KSHV. With the sodium butyrate treatment, no degradation of TRIF was observed (Fig. 7B). The induction of lytic replication by sodium butyrate is not 100%. However, endogenous TRIF is apparently low as we had to concentrate the cell lysates for the detection of endogenous TRIF. A slight induction of RTA might be sufficient to degrade endogenous TRIF. All these results suggest that the reduction of TRIF is specifically associated with the induction of KSHV RTA under physiological conditions. Recently, it has been shown that Sendai infection activates the RIG-I pathway for IFN induction (65Rehwinkel J. Tan C.P. Goubau D. Schulz O. Pichlmair A. Bier K. Robb N. Vreede F. Barclay W. Fodor E. Reis e Sousa C. Cell. 2010; 140: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the IFN blockage observed in Fig. 1 may not be related to TRIF degradation completely. We thus examined whether RTA could block a signaling pathway that absolutely requires TRIF. TRIF is absolutely required for TLR-3 signaling (27Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). It is well established that p56 is a good target and a marker of TLR-3 activation (56Sarkar S.N. Smith H.L. Rowe T.M. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4393-4396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 66Sarkar S.N. Peters K.L. Elco C.P. Sakamoto S. Pal S. Sen G.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 67Sen G.C. Sarkar S.N. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether the activation of p56 promoter by TLR-3 is affected by RTA expression. 293T cells were transfected with RTA- and TLR-3-expressing plasmids, and transfected cells were treated with or without synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). As shown in Fig. 8A, p56 promoter reporter was activated in response to TLR-3 and dsRNA (columns 2 and 3). However, in the presence of RTA, the activation was drastically reduced (columns 5 and 6). In addition to 293T cells, we also used the TLR-3-expressing cells (WT11) (56Sarkar S.N. Smith H.L. Rowe T.M. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4393-4396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8B, RTA reduced the dsRNA-mediated activation of the p56 promoter reporter. All these data suggested that RTA reduced TLR-3 signaling activities. Of note, in our 293T cells, IRF-7 was not degraded by RTA (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the blockage of TLR-3 signaling may be related to potential TRIF degradation. IFN is important to control KSHV infection, and a successful counteraction of IFN signaling may be a necessity for the survival of KSHV in vivo. It is thus not surprising that KSHV encodes several genes to counteract the innate IFN system. IRF-7 is targeted by at least two KSHV proteins (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 47Zhu F.X. King S.M. Smith E.J. Levy D.E. Yuan Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Latency-associated nuclear antigen is able to block the activation of IFN through IRF-3 (48Cloutier N. Flamand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7208-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). KSHV IRF homologs (vIRF1, vIRF2, and vIRF3) are able to block the production of IFNs by functioning as dominant negative versions of cellular IRFs. ORF10 blocks the IFN signaling in KSHV-infected cells (49Bisson S.A. Page A.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 5056-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein degradation has been shown to be important for antiviral responses (for a review, see Ref. 68Viswanathan K. Früh K. DeFilippis V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that RTA could block the IFN production without degradation of IRF-7 (Fig. 1). To address the possible mechanism behind this IRF-7 degradation-independent phenomenon, we find that RTA targets TRIF for the blockage of IFN production. First, we show that RTA reduces the expression of TRIF, and the reduction is likely to be specific to KSHV RTA as EBV RTA failed to reduce the expression of TRIF (Fig. 2). Second, RTA affects the stability of TRIF as its half-life is getting shorter in the presence of RTA (Fig. 3). In addition, RT-PCR results indicated that TRIF RNA was not affected by RTA (data not shown). Third, this RTA-mediated degradation of TRIF seemed to be present under physiological conditions as induction of lytic replication, and thus of the RTA expression, reduces the expression of endogenous TRIF protein (Fig. 7). Fourth and finally, the reduction of TRIF may be responsible for the blockage of TLR-3-mediated activation of p56 promoter in an IRF-7 degradation-independent manner (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). This RTA-mediated degradation of TRIF is apparently through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. First, RTA has been shown to be an E3 ligase for the degradation of IRF-7, Hey1, and K-RBP. We have found that RTA-K152E mutant lost some activity in degrading TRIF (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). The same mutant failed to degrade K-RBP (22Yang Z. Yan Z. Wood C. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3590-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Also, the mutation is located in the Cys/His-rich region (amino acids 118–207), the putative E3 ligase domain (20Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. Immunity. 2005; 22: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 22Yang Z. Yan Z. Wood C. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3590-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin and MG132) partially restore the TRIF protein expression (Fig. 6A and data not shown). Knockdown of ubiquitin increases the TRIF expression (Fig. 6B). RTA enhances high molecular weight smear formation in TRIF-C protein, and the smear is likely to be ubiquitin as the overexpression of ubiquitin enhances the formation (Fig. 6C). All these data suggest that RTA degrades TRIF, at least partially, through ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. TRIF is a cytoplasmic protein and mainly localized to the cell membrane (69McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2010; 22: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and KSHV RTA is a nuclear protein. We have failed to show that RTA is directly interacting with TRIF in co-immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown). In addition, we have done the immunostaining of the two proteins together in a cell and found that the two proteins were localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, and no obvious co-localization was observed (data not shown). Thus, under our experimental conditions, we failed to obtain convincing evidence that the two proteins physically interact with each other directly. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the two proteins may interact under some specific conditions/times. Based on our data, we propose that the RTA-mediated degradation of TRIF is through an indirect mechanism in which RTA activates an unknown cellular mediator(s) that facilitates the degradation of TRIF. Our results here suggest another novel pathway for KSHV to evade the host innate immunity. Specifically, TLR-4 has been identified as an important molecule against KSHV infection recently, and KSHV has developed a mechanism for rapid suppression of TLR-4 expression (37Lagos D. Vart R.J. Gratrix F. Westrop S.J. Emuss V. Wong P.P. Robey R. Imami N. Bower M. Gotch F. Boshoff C. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 470-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TLR-4 activation would lead to activation of TRIF, which further leads to the induction of type I IFNs. Therefore, this RTA-mediated degradation of TRIF may be used by KSHV to escape TLR-4-mediated innate immunity. Finally, the degradation of TRIF was observed in KSHV-infected cells under physiological concentrations (Fig. 7). Therefore, this phenomenon might naturally occur in individuals who have KSHV infection in vivo. The suppression of TLR-4 expression as well as TRIF degradation collectively suggest that the TLR-4 pathway is a critical one to control KSHV infection, and the virus employs two mechanisms to block TLR-4 activation. It is known that KSHV infects B cells, where the majority of TLRs are present (70Gregory S.M. West J.A. Dillon P.J. Hilscher C. Dittmer D.P. Damania B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11725-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, TRIF is an unexpectedly multifunctional adaptor protein, mediating activation of several transcription factors including NF-κB, a key mediator for pro-inflammatory cytokines (71O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). Additionally, TRIF may trigger apoptosis, and thus, degradation of TRIF may alleviate the potential apoptosis process. It is tempting to speculate that the RTA-mediated TRIF degradation may not be limited to the blockage of IFNs, but also other cellular activities for the benefits of KSHV in vivo. We thank Drs. Ganes Sen, Katherine Fitzgerald, and Clinton Jones for providing reagents for the study and the University of Nebraska – Lincoln Microscopy Facility for technical assistance."

IntroductionCandida albicans is a dimorphic human pathogenic fungus, which causes superficial as well as systemic infections most frequently in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or long term catheterization (1Jong A.Y. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Chen S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4536-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite currently applied antifungal therapies, both mortality and morbidity mediated by C. albicans are still unacceptably high (2Alonso-Valle H. Acha O. García-Palomo J.D. Fariñas-Alvarez C.

Therefore, new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are needed to prevent fungal spreading and tissue damage. The identification of novel yeast virulence factors that contribute to pathogenicity is necessary for approaching new strategies to fight and interfere with Candida infections. In this study, we aimed to identify surface proteins that are central for C. albicans innate immune escape.The human complement system forms the first defense line of innate immunity. Upon infection, microbes are immediately attacked by this highly efficient human immune system (5Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 6Zipfel P.F. Würzner R. Skerka C. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Complement can be activated via three major pathways. The classical pathway (CP) 2The abbreviations used are: CPclassical pathwayLPlectin pathwayCCPcomplement control proteinC4BPC4b-binding proteinDPBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salineNHSnormal human serumHi-NHSheat-inactivated normal human serumITCisothermal titration calorimetry. is mainly induced by antibodies bound to target structures or by C-reactive protein, and the lectin pathway (LP) is activated by binding of mannose-binding lectin or ficolins to mannan-containing structures on surfaces (7Mihlan M. Stippa S. Józsi M. Zipfel P.F. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1630-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Garred P. Honoré C. Ma Y.J. Munthe-Fog L. Hummelshøj T. Mol.

The alternative pathway is initiated spontaneously and continuously by randomly generated C3b, and activated C3b can bind directly to any surface and initiate an amplification loop of the alternative pathway (10Zipfel P.F. Mihlan M. Skerka C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 598: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Zipfel P.F. Heinen S. Józsi M. Skerka C. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Progression of the complement cascade is controlled by fluid phase inhibitors, which are distributed in plasma and body fluid, or surface-bound inhibitors. These inhibitors include C4BP, a 570-kDa plasma glycoprotein, which is the major fluid phase CP and LP inhibitor (12Blom A.M. Nandakumar K.S. Holmdahl R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2009; 68: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as well as Factor H and FHL-1 (Factor H-like protein 1), which are the major fluid phase alternative pathway inhibitors (13Friese M.A. Hellwage J.

The CP/LP inhibitor C4BP is formed by one β-chain and seven identical α-chains, all of which are composed of complement control protein (CCP) domains. The α-chain consists of eight CCPs, and the β-chain consists of three CCPs (18Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp.

C4BP regulates complement by binding to C4b via the N terminus of each α-chain (20Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27136-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), thereby making C4b susceptible to degradation by the plasma serine protease Factor I and by accelerating the decay of the CP/LP C3-convertase C4bC2b (21Blom A.M.

Immunol. 1985; 135: 440-444PubMed Google Scholar). C4BP also inhibits the activity of the alternative pathway C3-convertase in a fluid phase and acts as a cofactor in Factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b (23Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Microbial pathogens mimic human surfaces; acquire complement inhibitors, including C4BP, Factor H, and FHL-1, to their surface; and utilize the attached human regulators for complement evasion (6Zipfel P.F.

These kinds of microbial pathogens include fungi, like C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus (24Meri T. Blom A.M. Hartmann A. Lenk D. Meri S. Zipfel P.F. Infect.

As a surface protein, Pra1 binds human plasma proteins Factor H, FHL-1, and plasminogen. Released to a supernatant, soluble Pra1 binds back to the fungal surface (25Luo S. Poltermann S. Kunert A.

Via binding to C4BP, Pra1 controls the classical and lectin pathway complement attack, such as C3b and C4b surface deposition, as well as C4b cleavage, thereby favoring C. albicans infection.DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we identify Candida Pra1 as the first fungal C4BP-binding protein, localize the Pra1 binding domains within C4BP, and show that bound C4BP maintains complement-inhibitory activity, such as C4b cleavage, as well as C3b and C4b surface deposition. Thus, Pra1, by acquiring human complement inhibitor C4BP to C. albicans surface, controls the classical pathway of complement and favors fungal infection. The identification of this additional novel function makes the fungal virulence factor Candida Pra1 an attractive candidate for immune intervention.C4BP acquisition is a general immune evasion strategy and is used by many pathogens. Pra1 is the first fungal C4BP-binding protein identified from C. albicans. Candida Pra1 binds both plasma-purified and recombinant C4BP (Fig. 1, A and B). Pra1-C4BP interaction is an exothermic reaction and has an affinity (Ka) of 1.90E5 ± 3.04E4 m−1 as determined by ITC (Fig. 2). Pra1-C4BP interaction is ionic in nature and is affected by NaCl (Fig. 3). This type of interaction is similar to the Pra1-Factor H interaction (25Luo S. Poltermann S. Kunert A. Rupp S. Zipfel P.F. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 47: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but different from that of the streptococcal M protein-C4BP interaction, which is hydrophobic in nature (30Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar). C4BP binds Candida Pra1 via domains CCP4, CCP7, and CCP8. Thus, C4BP attached to Candida Pra1 still has the complement interaction domains (i.e. CCP1 to CCP3) are accessible and expose the functional regions to the outside (20Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27136-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). ITC data identify multiple binding sites (n = 2.5 ± 0.07) within C4BP for Pra1. ELISAs with various purified recombinant deletion constructs of the α chain of C4BP revealed three separated interaction sites, which were located to CCP4, CCP7, and CCP8. Thus, the difference between the ELISA and the ITC data indicates that some binding sites are hidden and not accessible for Pra1 in the intact C4BP protein. C4BP-Pra1 interaction shows a rather similar attachment to other microbial proteins. The ubiquitous surface proteins A1 (Usp A1) and Usp A2 of Moraxella catarrhalis bind C4BP via domains CCP2 and CCP7 (51Nordström T. Blom A.M. Forsgren A. Riesbeck K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4598-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia coli K1 and Haemophilus influenzae (38Hallström T. Jarva H. Riesbeck K. Blom A.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6359-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) binds C4BP via domains CCP3 and CCP8 (52Prasadarao N.V. Blom A.M. Villoutreix B.O. Linsangan L.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6352-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, streptococcal M protein (30Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar) and N. gonorrhoeae porins (53Jarva H. Ngampasutadol J. Ram S. Rice P.A. Villoutreix B.O. Blom A.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) bind to C4BP via the N-terminal CCP1. Filamentous hemagglutinin of Bordetella pertussis (54Berggård K. Johnsson E. Mooi F.R. Lindahl G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) binds to C4BP via CCP1 and CCP2. Similarly, both yeast and hyphae forms of intact C. albicans bind to C4BP mainly via CCP1 and CCP2 (24Meri T. Blom A.M. Hartmann A. Lenk D. Meri S. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6633-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This difference between C4BP binding to Pra1 and to intact C. albicans cells indicates the existence of an additional C4BP ligand(s) at the surface of C. albicans.Candida Pra1 binds both C4BP and Factor H. The acquired human inhibitors have a functional relevance. At physiological levels, both C4BP and Factor H bind at the same time to Pra1, and Factor H binding is not affected upon increasing C4BP levels. However, at non-physiological C4BP levels, Factor H binding was only mildly affected by C4BP binding. This weak inhibitory effect of C4BP is explained by steric effects due to the large size of the C4BP protein of 550 kDa. Thus, C4BP and Factor H bind simultaneously to Candida Pra1, and the two human inhibitors bind to distinct sites within the Candida Pra1 protein at the physiological conditions.The Pra1-overexpressing C. albicans strain binds C4BP more efficiently (about 2-fold) as compared with wild type strain CAI4 (Fig. 7). Furthermore, a Pra1 knock-out mutant shows reduced (∼22%) but not a complete lack of C4BP binding (Fig. 8). These results show that Pra1 at the yeast surface binds C4BP and also suggest the existence of additional C4BP-binding proteins at the C. albicans surface. C. albicans utilizes surface Pra1 to acquire human complement inhibitor C4BP. Bound C4BP maintains complement-inhibitory activity and acts as a cofactor for Factor I-mediated cleavage of C4b (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9). This C4b inactivation will inhibit formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase (C4bC2b) at the fungal surface and consequently blocks further progression of the complement cascade, generation of proinflammatory products, and C4b and C3b surface opsonization (Fig. 9). The lower number of C4b/C3b on the fungal surface reduces adhesion to and uptake of the C. albicans by human macrophages (supplemental Fig. S2). There is a clear correlation between the number of deposited C4b/C3b molecules on the fungal surface and better adhesion and phagocytosis.At present, the domain structure of Candida Pra1 is not known. So far, a collagen-like motive was identified in the Pra1 sequence, which may be involved in the anchoring, attaching, and colonization of C. albicans onto the extracellular matrices (50Sepúlveda P. Murgui A. López-Ribot J.L. Casanova M. Timoneda J. Martínez J.P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2173-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the binding sites for the various human complement inhibitors have not been mapped in this fungal protein.Candida Pra1 is an effective fungal virulence factor that is present on the surface of the pathogen and that is also secreted. Pra1 displays multiple biological roles at these different locations. As a yeast surface protein, Pra1 binds several human complement inhibitors, including the classical pathway inhibitor C4BP and the alternative pathway regulators Factor H and FHL-1, as well as plasminogen. The Pra1-bound human regulators are functionally active, inhibit complement activation at the fungal surface, and degrade extracellular matrix components (25Luo S. Poltermann S. Kunert A. Rupp S. Zipfel P.F. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 47: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As a secreted protein, Pra1 complexes C3 in solution, blocks cleavage of C3 by a C3 convertase, and thus inhibits further complement activation and immune effector functions (55Luo S. Hartmann A. Dahse H.M. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, secreted Pra1 enhances Factor H-mediated complement control in the fluid phase (25Luo S. Poltermann S. Kunert A. Rupp S. Zipfel P.F. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 47: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This effect on cofactor activity is specific for the alternative pathway but is not observed for the classical pathway (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, secreted Pra1 can bind back to the surface of C. albicans, which can replenish surface function of Pra1. Secreted Pra1 binds to human CR3-expressing cells like neutrophils and monocytes. The addition of Pra1 to co-cultures of C. albicans and human neutrophils blocks CR3-mediated uptake of the pathogen and enhances fungal survival (43Soloviev D.A. Fonzi W.A. Sentandreu R. Pluskota E. Forsyth C.B. Yadav S. Plow E.F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2038-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 56Agarwal V. Asmat T.M. Luo S. Jensch I. Zipfel P.F. Hammerschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23486-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, by binding to the integrin receptor CR3, Pra1 may act as a decoy to block CR3 signaling or CR3-mediated fungal uptake.In summary, Candida Pra1 harbors multiple functions to control human immune responses and provides an example of the multiple and complex immune escape reactions that are all mediated by one single fungal virulence factor. A detailed understanding of these multiple roles of Pra1 could also allow the creation of new strategies to interfere with and fight against C. albicans infection. IntroductionCandida albicans is a dimorphic human pathogenic fungus, which causes superficial as well as systemic infections most frequently in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or long term catheterization (1Jong A.Y. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Chen S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4536-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite currently applied antifungal therapies, both mortality and morbidity mediated by C. albicans are still unacceptably high (2Alonso-Valle H. Acha O. García-Palomo J.D. Fariñas-Alvarez C. Fernández-Mazarrasa C. Fariñas M.C. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2003; 22: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Gudlaugsson O. Gillespie S. Lee K. Vande Berg J. Hu J.

Therefore, new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are needed to prevent fungal spreading and tissue damage. The identification of novel yeast virulence factors that contribute to pathogenicity is necessary for approaching new strategies to fight and interfere with Candida infections. In this study, we aimed to identify surface proteins that are central for C. albicans innate immune escape.The human complement system forms the first defense line of innate immunity. Upon infection, microbes are immediately attacked by this highly efficient human immune system (5Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 6Zipfel P.F. Würzner R. Skerka C. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Complement can be activated via three major pathways. The classical pathway (CP) 2The abbreviations used are: CPclassical pathwayLPlectin pathwayCCPcomplement control proteinC4BPC4b-binding proteinDPBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salineNHSnormal human serumHi-NHSheat-inactivated normal human serumITCisothermal titration calorimetry. is mainly induced by antibodies bound to target structures or by C-reactive protein, and the lectin pathway (LP) is activated by binding of mannose-binding lectin or ficolins to mannan-containing structures on surfaces (7Mihlan M. Stippa S. Józsi M. Zipfel P.F. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1630-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Garred P. Honoré C. Ma Y.J. Munthe-Fog L. Hummelshøj T. Mol.

The alternative pathway is initiated spontaneously and continuously by randomly generated C3b, and activated C3b can bind directly to any surface and initiate an amplification loop of the alternative pathway (10Zipfel P.F. Mihlan M. Skerka C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 598: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Zipfel P.F. Heinen S. Józsi M. Skerka C. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Progression of the complement cascade is controlled by fluid phase inhibitors, which are distributed in plasma and body fluid, or surface-bound inhibitors. These inhibitors include C4BP, a 570-kDa plasma glycoprotein, which is the major fluid phase CP and LP inhibitor (12Blom A.M. Nandakumar K.S. Holmdahl R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2009; 68: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as well as Factor H and FHL-1 (Factor H-like protein 1), which are the major fluid phase alternative pathway inhibitors (13Friese M.A. Hellwage J.

The CP/LP inhibitor C4BP is formed by one β-chain and seven identical α-chains, all of which are composed of complement control protein (CCP) domains. The α-chain consists of eight CCPs, and the β-chain consists of three CCPs (18Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp.

C4BP regulates complement by binding to C4b via the N terminus of each α-chain (20Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27136-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), thereby making C4b susceptible to degradation by the plasma serine protease Factor I and by accelerating the decay of the CP/LP C3-convertase C4bC2b (21Blom A.M.

Immunol. 1985; 135: 440-444PubMed Google Scholar). C4BP also inhibits the activity of the alternative pathway C3-convertase in a fluid phase and acts as a cofactor in Factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b (23Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Microbial pathogens mimic human surfaces; acquire complement inhibitors, including C4BP, Factor H, and FHL-1, to their surface; and utilize the attached human regulators for complement evasion (6Zipfel P.F.

https://openalex.org/W2068775831,"Neurotensin (NT) is a gastrointestinal neuropeptide that modulates intestinal inflammation and healing by binding to its high-affinity receptor NTR1. The dual role of NT in inflammation and healing is demonstrated in models of colitis induced by Clostridium difficile toxin A and dextran sulfate sodium, respectively, and involves NF-κB-dependent IL-8 expression and EGF receptor-mediated MAPK activation in human colonocytes. However, the detailed signaling pathways involved in these responses remain to be elucidated. We report here that NT/NTR1 coupling in human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells activates tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. NT also rapidly induces Src tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas pretreatment of cells with the Src inhibitor PP2 before NT exposure decreases NT-induced IGF-1R phosphorylation. In addition, inhibition of IGF-1R activation by either its specific antagonist AG1024 or siRNA against IGF-1 significantly reduces NT-induced IL-8 expression and NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression. Pretreatment with AG1024 also inhibits Akt activation and apoptosis induced by NT. Silencing of Akt expression by siRNA also substantially attenuates NT-induced IL-8 promoter activity and NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression. This is the first report to indicate that NT transactivates IGF-1R and that this response is linked to Akt phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, contributing to both pro-inflammatory and tissue repair signaling pathways in response to NT in colonic epithelial cells. We propose that IGF-1R activation represents a previously unrecognized key pathway involved in the mechanisms by which NT and NTR1 modulate colonic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070093704,"D-type cyclins regulate cellular outcomes in part through cyclin-dependent, kinase-independent mechanisms that modify transcription factor action, and recent in vivo studies showed that cyclin D1 associates with a large number of transcriptional regulators in cells of the retina and breast. Given the frequency of cyclin D1 alterations in cancer, it is imperative to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which cyclin D1 controls key transcription factor networks in human disease. Prostate cancer was used as a paradigm because this tumor type is reliant at all stages of the disease on androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and cyclin D1 has been shown to negatively modulate AR-dependent expression of prostate-specific antigen (KLK3/PSA). Strategies were employed to control cyclin D1 expression under conditions of hormone depletion, and the effect of cyclin D1 on subsequent androgen-dependent gene expression was determined using unbiased gene expression profiling. Modulating cyclin D1 conferred widespread effects on androgen signaling and revealed cyclin D1 to be a selective effector of hormone action. A subset of androgen-induced target genes, known to be directly regulated by AR, was strongly suppressed by cyclin D1. Analyses of AR occupancy at target gene regulatory loci of clinical relevance demonstrated that cyclin D1 limits AR residence after hormone stimulation. Together, these findings reveal a new function for cyclin D1 in controlling hormone-dependent transcriptional outcomes and demonstrate a pervasive role for cyclin D1 in regulating transcription factor dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2059271361,"Mast cells are critical effector cells in the pathophysiology of allergic asthma and other IgE-mediated diseases. The Tec family of tyrosine kinases Itk and Btk serve as critical signal amplifiers downstream of antigen receptors. Although both kinases are expressed and activated in mast cells following FcεRI stimulation, their individual contributions are not clear. To determine whether these kinases play unique and/or complementary roles in FcεRI signaling and mast cell function, we generated Itk and Btk double knock-out mice. Analyses of these mice show decreased mast cell granularity and impaired passive systemic anaphylaxis responses. This impaired response is accompanied by a significant elevation in serum IgE in Itk/Btk double knock-out mice. In vitro analyses of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) indicated that Itk/Btk double knock-out BMMCs are defective in degranulation and cytokine secretion responses downstream to FcεRI activation. These responses were accompanied by a significant reduction in PLCγ2 phosphorylation and severely impaired calcium responses in these cells. This defect also results in altered NFAT1 nuclear localization in double knock-out BMMCs. Network analysis suggests that although they may share substrates, Itk plays both positive and negative roles, while Btk primarily plays a positive role in mast cell FcεRI-induced cytokine secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2080990756,"Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive congenital neuropathy that results from abnormal development and progressive degeneration of the sensory and autonomic nervous system. The mutation observed in almost all FD patients is a point mutation at position 6 of intron 20 of the IKBKAP gene; this gene encodes the IκB kinase complex-associated protein (IKAP). The mutation results in a tissue-specific splicing defect: Exon 20 is skipped, leading to reduced IKAP protein expression. Here we show that phosphatidylserine (PS), an FDA-approved food supplement, increased IKAP mRNA levels in cells derived from FD patients. Long-term treatment with PS led to a significant increase in IKAP protein levels in these cells. A conjugate of PS and an omega-3 fatty acid also increased IKAP mRNA levels. Furthermore, PS treatment released FD cells from cell cycle arrest and up-regulated a significant number of genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Our results suggest that PS has potential for use as a therapeutic agent for FD. Understanding its mechanism of action may reveal the mechanism underlying the FD disease."
https://openalex.org/W1969164288,"Recent studies have shown that embryonic stem (ES) cells globally express most genes in the genome at the mRNA level; however, it is unclear whether this global expression is propagated to the protein level. Cell surface proteins could perform critical functions in ES cells, so determining whether ES cells globally express cell surface proteins would have significant implications for ES cell biology.The surface proteins of mouse ES cells were purified by biotin labeling and subjected to proteomics analysis. About 1000 transmembrane or secreted cell surface proteins were identified. These proteins covered a large variety if functional categories including signal transduction, adhesion and transporting. More over, mES cells promiscuously expressed a wide variety of tissue specific surface proteins. And many surface proteins were expressed heterogeneously on mES cells. We also find that human ES cells express a wide variety of tissue specific surface proteins.Our results indicate that global gene expression is not simply a result of leaky gene expression, which could be attributed to the loose chromatin structure of ES cells; it is also propagated to the functional level. ES cells may use diverse surface proteins to receive signals from the diverse extracellular stimuli that initiate differentiation. Moreover, the promiscuous expression of tissue specific surface proteins illuminate new insights into the strategies of cell surface marker screening."

The expression of CCN1 becomes abnormally reduced during the hyperoxic and ischemic phases of ROP modeled in the mouse eye with oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Lentivirus-mediated re-expression of CCN1 enhanced physiological adaptation of the retinal vasculature to hyperoxia and reduced pathological angiogenesis following ischemia. Remarkably, injection into the vitreous of OIR mice of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) engineered to express CCN1 harnessed ischemia-induced neovessel outgrowth without adversely affecting the physiological adaptation of retinal vessels to hyperoxia. In vitro exposure of HSCs to recombinant CCN1 induced integrin-dependent cell adhesion, migration, and expression of specific endothelial cell markers as well as many components of the Wnt signaling pathway including Wnt ligands, their receptors, inhibitors, and downstream targets.

https://openalex.org/W1972701357,"Better drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of African sleeping sickness. We tested a series of promising anticancer agents belonging to the 4-substituted 4-hydroxycyclohexa-2,5-dienones class (""quinols"") and identified several with potent trypanocidal activity (EC(50) < 100 nM). In mammalian cells, quinols are proposed to inhibit the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system, which is absent from trypanosomes. Studies with the prototypical 4-benzothiazole-substituted quinol, PMX464, established that PMX464 is rapidly cytocidal, similar to the arsenical drug, melarsen oxide. Cell lysis by PMX464 was accelerated by addition of sublethal concentrations of glucose oxidase implicating oxidant defenses in the mechanism of action. Whole cells treated with PMX464 showed a loss of trypanothione (T(SH)(2)), a unique dithiol in trypanosomes, and tryparedoxin peroxidase (TryP), a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin similar to mammalian thioredoxin peroxidase. Enzyme assays revealed that T(SH)(2), TryP, and a glutathione peroxidase-like tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidase were inhibited in time- and concentration-dependent manners. The inhibitory activities of various quinol analogues against these targets showed a good correlation with growth inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei. The monothiols glutathione and L-cysteine bound in a 2:1 ratio with PMX464 with K(d) values of 6 and 27 μM, respectively, whereas T(SH)(2) bound more tightly in a 1:1 ratio with a K(d) value of 430 nM. Overexpression of trypanothione synthetase in T. brucei decreased sensitivity to PMX464 indicating that the key metabolite T(SH)(2) is a target for quinols. Thus, the quinol pharmacophore represents a novel lead structure for the development of a new drug against African sleeping sickness."

This study reports the prevalence of childhood trauma and examines its association with psychological distress among injecting drug users from mainland China.The study was conducted in three government-operated drug rehabilitation facilities in Shanghai, China in 2007. The Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form (ETISR-SF) was used to evaluate 4 types (general, emotional, physical and sexual) and severity of childhood trauma, and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) to evaluate psychological distress.Among 341 injecting drug users who completed the study, about 80% reported one or more types of childhood trauma, specifically 53% general trauma, 56% physical abuse, 36% emotional abuse and 26% sexual abuse. Compared to female injecting drug users, males reported significantly higher scores of general trauma and physical abuse, but lower sexual abuse scores. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that greater physical and emotional abuse in childhood predict greater current psychopathological distress among these injecting drug users in China.The results reveal a high prevalence of childhood trauma among injecting drug users in China, and it is comparable to other similar studies in Western countries. It is important to consider the role of childhood trauma in the prevention and treatment of substance abuse."
https://openalex.org/W2093223987,"Archaea are important to the carbon and nitrogen cycles, but it remains uncertain how rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO(2)]) will influence the structure and function of soil archaeal communities.We measured abundances of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA and amoA genes, phylogenies of archaeal 16S rRNA and amoA genes, concentrations of KCl-extractable soil ammonium and nitrite, and potential ammonia oxidation rates in rhizosphere soil samples from maize and soybean exposed to ambient (∼385 ppm) and elevated (550 ppm) [CO(2)] in a replicated and field-based study. There was no influence of elevated [CO(2)] on copy numbers of archaeal or bacterial 16S rRNA or amoA genes, archaeal community composition, KCl-extractable soil ammonium or nitrite, or potential ammonia oxidation rates for samples from maize, a model C(4) plant. Phylogenetic evidence indicated decreased relative abundance of crenarchaeal sequences in the rhizosphere of soybean, a model leguminous-C(3) plant, at elevated [CO(2)], whereas quantitative PCR data indicated no changes in the absolute abundance of archaea. There were no changes in potential ammonia oxidation rates at elevated [CO(2)] for soybean. Ammonia oxidation rates were lower in the rhizosphere of maize than soybean, likely because of lower soil pH and/or abundance of archaea. KCl-extractable ammonium and nitrite concentrations were lower at elevated than ambient [CO(2)] for soybean.Plant-driven shifts in soil biogeochemical processes in response to elevated [CO(2)] affected archaeal community composition, but not copy numbers of archaeal genes, in the rhizosphere of soybean. The lack of a treatment effect for maize is consistent with the fact that the photosynthesis and productivity of maize are not stimulated by elevated [CO(2)] in the absence of drought."

Host cell responses to intracellular CagA have been linked exclusively to signaling motifs in the C terminus of the CagA protein. Little is known about the functional role of the remaining CagA protein. Using transgenic expression of CagA mutants in epithelial cells, we were able to identify a novel CagA inhibitory domain at the N terminus consisting of the first 200 amino acids. This domain localizes to cell-cell contacts and increases the rate and strength of cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells. Thus, it compensates for the loss of cell-cell adhesion induced by the C terminus of the CagA protein. Consistent with its stabilizing role on cell-cell adhesion, the CagA N terminus domain reduces the CagA-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity in the nucleus. Furthermore, it inhibits apical surface constriction and cell elongations, host cell phenotypes induced by the C terminus in polarized epithelia.

Helicobacter pylori infection is a well established risk factor for gastric cancer.

Therefore, we asked the question how the N terminus of CagA affects host cell physiology, both dependent and independent of signaling motifs in the CagA C terminus. In this manuscript we present data showing that CagA consists of two independent domains at the N and C termini of the protein, respectively, with which the protein tethers to structures at the plasma membrane of host cells. The first 200 AA of the N terminus of CagA act as an inhibitory domain of host cell responses evoked by the CagA C terminus: (i) it increases the rate and strength of newly formed cell-cell contacts, (ii) it decreases cell elongation and constriction of the apical membrane induced by the C terminus, and (iii) it reduces TCF/β-catenin transcriptional activity mediated by the C terminus of CagA. Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described before (27Nelson W.J. Veshnock P.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For MDCK II cells to polarize, 5 × 105 cells were plated on Transwell filters (12-mm well, 0.4-μm pore size; Corning) and incubated for 2 days before transfection experiments. The gastric cell line NCI-N87 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in recommended culture conditions. Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of plasmid cDNA according to the manufacturer's manual. Inducible expression of CagA and CagA mutants in MDCK II cell lines was generated via the Tet-On® advanced inducible gene expression system (Clontech). For induction of protein expression, 3 μg/ml doxycycline was added to cell culture medium 24 h prior to experiments. For CagA cloning, we modified the pTRE-tight vector from Clontech as follows. The multiple cloning site was replaced by enhanced GFP from Clontech vector pEGFP at the N terminus and the SBP/CBP tag from vector pCTAP (Stratagene) at the C terminus. CagA constructs were generated by PCR from previously published pEGFP-CagA WT plasmid (H. pylori strain G27 (25Bagnoli F. Buti L. Tompkins L. Covacci A. Amieva M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

CagA mutants 200–1216, 400–1216, and Δ200–800 were cloned by replacing the SBP/CBP tag with a CagA 800–1216 PCR product via NotI/XbaI. Respective CagA PCR products 200–800, 400–800, 1–200, and 27–800 were cloned in-frame between GFP and CagA 800–1216 via SalI/NotI. For co-expression experiments, CagA 871–1216 was cloned by replacing the SBP/CBP tag with a respective PCR product via NotI/XbaI. For RFP tagging of CagA 871–1216 and CagA 200–1216, enhanced GFP was replaced by monomeric RFP (28Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl.

In a second step, GFP-CagA WT was cloned via BamHI/NotI into the above-mentioned modified pTRE-tight vector and therefore includes in addition an N-terminal Myc tag. For CagA EPISA C, a chemically synthesized cDNA fragment encoding for AA 943–1055 with both EPIYA C motifs mutated to EPISA C was inserted into CagA ΔPar1 via AscI/XbaI. CagA ΔPar1 was cloned by replacing AA 943–1027 with an AscI restriction site in CagA WT. Because of technical requirements, synthesis of the EPISA C fragment required a change in codon usage (from Canis familaris) optimized by GENEius software (Eurofins) (supplemental Fig. S1). For confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and were permeabilized in PBS + 3% bovine serum albumin + 1% saponin + 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with antibodies against ZO-1 (ms, mc, 1:200), Alexa Fluor 594- or 647-coupled phalloidin (Invitrogen) and anti-β-catenin (ms, mc, 1:200; BD Bioscience). Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 and 647) were purchased from Invitrogen. The samples were imaged with a confocal microscope (Leica SP5), and z-stacks were projected onto three-dimensional reconstructions by using Volocity 4.1 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The figures were assembled with Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems). MDCK II cells stably expressing CagA mutants (1 × 108 cells in two 150-mm dishes) were washed three times with PBS before transfer into detergent free homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 90 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm sucrose, proteinase inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2 from Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were mechanically broken via Branson sonifier 250 at 4 °C (duty cycle, 50%; output control at Microtiplimit, level 1 for 15 s; pause, 1 min; level 2 for 10 s). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter Type 100 Ti rotor, supernatant was removed, and pellet was resuspended in equal volumes of homogenization buffer. Respective protein samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (final concentration, 50 mm) for 10 min and separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After transfer to Immobilon-FL 0.45-m polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore), the proteins were blocked with LI-COR blocking buffer (Li-Cor, Germany) in PBS (1:1) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (1:30,000) were diluted in T-PBS (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were scanned with Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor) at 680- and 800-nm wavelengths, and the amount of protein per lane was determined with Odyssey software 1.2. Primary antibody against CagA (rabbit, polyclonal, 1:3000) was made against recombinant GST-CagA1–877 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli (30Tan S. Tompkins L.S. Amieva M.R. PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e1000407Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Anti-E-cadherin (ms, mc, 1:3000) was purchased from BD Bioscience, anti-actin (ms, mc, 1:1000) was from Sigma-Aldrich, and anti-Mek-1 (clone H-8, ms, mc, 1:1000) was from Santa Cruz. Alexa-Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse was purchased from Invitrogen, and anti-rabbit IRDye 800 was from Rockland Immunochemicals. Polarized MDCK II cells were transiently transfected with CagA and CagA mutant plasmids. To measure apical surface area, we stained epithelial cells with antibodies against ZO-1 and identified transfected cells via GFP fluorescence signal. Confocal optical sections from random fields were collapsed into single projections. Apical surface areas of individual cells were determined as the area confined by ZO-1 and measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For the cell elongation assay, CagA or CagA mutant transfected cells were evaluated for cellular protrusion formation. Protrusions extending the diameter of the main cell body were counted as positive for cell elongation. CagA-expressing cells were evaluated independent of their expression level, and the numbers of cells were counted as indicated in the figure legends. The assay was performed as described before (31Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In brief, MDCK II cell lines stably expressing CagA or CagA mutants were grown at low density, and expression was induced 24 h before the experiment. The cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended as single-cell suspensions at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Twenty-microliter drops of cell suspension were pipetted onto inside surface of six-well cell culture dish lids, and the wells were filled with 2 ml of medium each to prevent evaporation. At 4 h, the lid was inverted, and the drops were spread onto a glass slide. For trituration, the drops were first pipetted 10 times through a 20-μl pipette. At each time point, three drops were photographed, and the numbers and sizes of clusters were determined. NCI-N87 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and grown to 60% confluence. The cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of Topflash, 100 ng of Fopflash (kindly provided by W. J. Nelson, Stanford University), 100 ng of pTeton-Advanced (Clontech), and 300 ng of CagA WT or CagA 200–1216 cDNA, respectively. CagA expression was activated using 3 μg/ml doxycycline. After 24 h, the cells were harvested in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was determined in a dual channel luminometer according to manufacturer's protocol for a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The results were normalized for transfection efficiency by co-transfection of 6.25 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid (kindly provided by W. J. Nelson, Stanford University). The mean values and S.E. were calculated from at least three independent experiments. For statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance, Student's t test, Tukey's multiple comparison test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used as indicated in figure legends (R project for statistical computing, R version 2.8.1 for Mac OS X, GNU Project, and GraphPad Prism, Graph Pad Software). Because CagA targeting to the membrane is important for host signaling (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M.

The CagA sequence was derived from the H. pylori strain G27, and CagA mutants were expressed in MDCK II cells as a model for polarized epithelial cells (25Bagnoli F. Buti L. Tompkins L. Covacci A.

Science. 2003; 300: 1430-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). All of the CagA constructs were tagged with GFP at the N terminus of CagA and transiently or stably expressed in a doxycycline-inducible gene expression system. By the addition of doxycycline to the growth medium, CagA expression is turned on within hours. It has been reported that CagA derived from the H. pylori NCTC11637 strain interacts with the plasma membrane via the EPIYA motifs of CagA in undifferentiated epithelial gastric cancer cells. A cagA deletion mutant lacking the EPIYA motifs in the C terminus did not co-localize with the membrane compartment in AGS cells (26Higashi H. Yokoyama K. Fujii Y. Ren S. Yuasa H. Saadat I. Murata-Kamiya N. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23130-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the EPIYA motif containing the C terminus is sufficient for this interaction. In our study, a CagA mutant containing the EPIYA motifs (CagA 800–1216) localized in the cytoplasm when transiently transfected in polarized MDCK II cells (Fig. 2A). This confirms the finding in a previous study using a CagA 871–1216 mutant derived from the same H. pylori strain G27 (25Bagnoli F. Buti L. Tompkins L. Covacci A. Amieva M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16339-16344Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because a cytoplasmic immunofluorescence signal could mask co-localization with the membrane compartment, we analyzed the distribution of CagA 800–1216 between membrane and cytoplasm in a biochemical membrane pelleting assay using MDCK II cells stably expressing CagA and CagA mutants under the control of a doxycycline-inducible gene expression system. In this assay, the cells were broken mechanically in a buffer without detergents to preserve lipid membrane particles. This was followed by high speed ultracentrifugation, which pellets particles and separates them from the soluble content of the cytoplasm. A marker for plasma membrane, E-cadherin, is localized in the pellet fraction, whereas a marker for cytoplasmic proteins, Mek-1, is in the supernatant (Fig. 2B). Approximately two-thirds of the CagA 800–1216 mutant protein were detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2B), indicating an indirect or direct interaction of this part with the membrane compartment. These data suggest that the EPIYA-containing C terminus interacts with membrane fractions but is not sufficient for a complete membrane association in epithelial cells. To determine which other parts of CagA are necessary for a complete co-localization with the membrane compartment, we tested CagA mutants varying in length at the C terminus. A CagA mutant consisting of AA 400–1216 (CagA 400–1216) was similar to CagA 800–1216 in its subcellular localization (Fig. 2A). In contrast, an extended CagA mutant AA 200–1216 (CagA 200–1216) localized exclusively to the membrane compartment as assessed by immunofluorescence with a strong localization to the apical membrane compartment in polarized epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). In the membrane pelleting assay, CagA 200–1216 localized completely with the membrane fraction, confirming the immunofluorescence result (Fig. 2B). The ability of CagA 200–1216 to localize to the membrane is not dependent on the CagA segment 200–400 alone, because a CagA 200–800 fragment is distributed similarly to CagA 800–1216 throughout the cytoplasm when assessed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2A). The high speed centrifugation step revealed that ∼46% of the mutant protein associated with the membrane compartment (Fig. 2B). To show that the cellular localization of the CagA C-terminal mutant proteins is independent of cell lines, we expressed the CagA fragments transiently in the gastric epithelial cell line NCI-N87. Both analyzed constructs, CagA 800–1216 and CagA 200–1216, behaved similarly in regard to their cellular distribution in these cells as shown for MDCK II cells (Fig. 2C). A previous report demonstrated that a N terminus fragment of CagA (AA 1–877) interacts with the C terminus fragment (AA 871–1216) when transiently expressed in trans in epithelial cells. Thus, the C-terminal part (AA 871–1216) is directed from the cytoplasm to the membrane compartment (25Bagnoli F. Buti L. Tompkins L. Covacci A. Amieva M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16339-16344Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore we asked whether the CagA fragments AA 200–800 and AA 871–1216 are able to interact with each other. The localization of RFP-CagA 871–1216 in transiently transfected polarized MDCK II cells is similar to GFP-CagA 800–1216 (compare Figs. 3A and 2A). When ectopically expressed in the same cell, the mutant proteins GFP-CagA 200–800 and RFP-CagA 871–1216 co-localized with each other primarily at the membrane compartment (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that CagA 200–800 and the EPIYA motifs containing C terminus of CagA (871–1216) interact with each other, forming a domain that targets the CagA protein directly or indirectly to the membrane compartment. It has been published that the N terminus of CagA (CagA 1–877) interacts with the plasma membrane independent of the CagA C terminus (25Bagnoli F. Buti L. Tompkins L. Covacci A. Amieva M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16339-16344Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because CagA 200–800 located only partially to the membrane compartment (Fig. 2, A and B), we analyzed the first 200 AA of the N terminus in regard to its capacity to co-localize with the membrane compartment. Transient expression of a CagA 1–200 fragment in polarized MDCK II cells reveals that this fragment is sufficient to co-localize with the membrane compartment (Fig. 4A). The cellular distribution was again confirmed using NCl-N87 cells (Fig. 4A). The ability of the N terminus of CagA to co-localize with the plasma membrane in epithelial cells is confined to the first 200 AA. CagA mutants shorter than 200 AA (CagA 1–150) or a mutant lacking the first 26 AA (CagA 27–225) were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). When expressed in nonpolarized subconfluent MDCK II cells, CagA 1–200 was enriched at sites of cell-cell contacts co-localizing with β-catenin, a protein important for the formation of cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 5A). CagA 1–200 was excluded from membrane sites not engaged in cell-cell contacts (see arrowhead in Fig. 5B). Interestingly, in nonpolarized subconfluent cells, the C terminus fragment CagA 200–1216 distributes along the entire membrane compartment including membrane sites not engaged in cell-cell contacts (see arrowhead in Fig. 5C). This diverse distribution pattern of the N-terminal and C-terminal domain at the membrane suggests that they may interact with different membrane substructures. After identifying two distinct membrane-targeting domains, we asked whether they would interfere with each other's role in host cell responses. Once CagA is intracellular in host cells, it causes cell elongation (14Hatakeyama M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Churin Y. Al-Ghoul L. Kepp O.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16339-16344Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) showed that in polarized epithelial cells CagA-expressing host cells exhibit an elongated morphology with a constriction of the apical surface area. To analyze the effects of both membrane-targeting domains on cell elongation, we counted the number of CagA expressing cells with cellular protrusions extending the diameter of the cell body in transiently transfected polarized MDCK II cells (Fig. 6A). Host cells expressing CagA WT (1–1216) developed cellular protrusions in 24.7 ± 4% of transfected cells (Fig. 6B). However, the formation of cellular protrusions was significantly increased to 48.2 ± 1.3% in CagA 200–1216 expressing cells. The number of CagA 800–1216-induced cellular protrusions was similar to CagA 200–1216 (46 ± 3.3%). CagA 1–200 had no effect on cell elongation (Fig. 6B). The decrease of cell elongation in CagA WT compared with CagA 200–1216 expressing cells suggests that CagA 1–200 exerts an inhibitory effect on cell signaling mediated by the C terminus of CagA. CagA 1–200 does not exert its inhibitory effect by acting directly on CagA 200–1216. When co-expressed as two separate mutants in the same cell, CagA 1–200 does not inhibit CagA 200–1216-induced cell elongation (45.3 ± 2.3%) (Fig. 6B). However, covalent binding to the signaling motifs in the C terminus is required for the inhibitory effect. CagA 1–200, when fused to CagA 800–1216 (CagA Δ200–800), tethers the CagA C terminus to the cell membrane (compare supplemental Fig. S2A and Fig. 2A). Epithelial cells expressing CagA Δ200–800 elongated significantly less compared with CagA 800–1216 but similar to CagA WT (24.4 ± 5.8%) (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of CagA 1–200 is due to membrane targeting of the C-terminal signaling motifs to an alternative membrane substructure. Because the deletion of larger parts of a protein could cause conformational changes, we analyzed the much shorter deletion mutants of CagA (CagA 27–1216). The"

https://openalex.org/W2045407687,"Identifying transcription factor binding sites genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based technology is becoming an increasingly important tool in addressing developmental questions. However, technical problems associated with factor abundance and suitable ChIP reagents are common obstacles to these studies in many biological systems. We have used two completely different, widely applicable methods to determine by ChIP the genome-wide binding sites of the master myogenic regulatory transcription factor HLH-1 (CeMyoD) in C. elegans embryos. The two approaches, ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip, yield strongly overlapping results revealing that HLH-1 preferentially binds to promoter regions of genes enriched for E-box sequences (CANNTG), known binding sites for this well-studied class of transcription factors. HLH-1 binding sites were enriched upstream of genes known to be expressed in muscle, consistent with its role as a direct transcriptional regulator. HLH-1 binding was also detected at numerous sites unassociated with muscle gene expression, as has been previously described for its mouse homolog MyoD. These binding sites may reflect several additional functions for HLH-1, including its interactions with one or more co-factors to activate (or repress) gene expression or a role in chromatin organization distinct from direct transcriptional regulation of target genes. Our results also provide a comparison of ChIP methodologies that can overcome limitations commonly encountered in these types of studies while highlighting the complications of assigning in vivo functions to identified target sites."
https://openalex.org/W2085774878,"Prion diseases occur following the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a disease related, protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). In these studies, a cell painting technique was used to introduce PrPC to prion-infected neuronal cell lines (ScGT1, ScN2a, or SMB cells). The addition of PrPC resulted in increased PrPSc formation that was preceded by an increase in the cholesterol content of cell membranes and increased activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). In contrast, although PrPC lacking one of the two acyl chains from its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (PrPC-G-lyso-PI) bound readily to cells, it did not alter the amount of cholesterol in cell membranes, was not found within detergent-resistant membranes (lipid rafts), and did not activate cPLA2. It remained within cells for longer than PrPC with a conventional GPI anchor and was not converted to PrPSc. Moreover, the addition of high amounts of PrPC-G-lyso-PI displaced cPLA2 from PrPSc-containing lipid rafts, reduced the activation of cPLA2, and reduced PrPSc formation in all three cell lines. In addition, ScGT1 cells treated with PrPC-G-lyso-PI did not transmit infection following intracerebral injection to mice. We propose that that the chemical composition of the GPI anchor attached to PrPC modified the local membrane microenvironments that control cell signaling, the fate of PrPC, and hence PrPSc formation.

The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which are also known as prion diseases, are invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in human(s). A key event in these diseases is the conversion of a normal host protein, designated PrPC, 3The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular prion protein; cPLA2, cytoplasmic phospholipase A2; PI, phosphatidylinositol; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IPG, inositolphosphoglycan. into a disease-associated isoform (PrPSc), which represents the major component of infectious scrapie prions (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5194) Google Scholar). This process involves a portion of PrPC that is mostly α-helix being refolded into a β-pleated sheet in the PrPSc molecule (2Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). PrPSc acts as a template that facilitates the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. The conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is accompanied by changes in biological and biochemical properties, including an increased resistance to proteases (3Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A.

For example, antibody studies suggest that PrPC conversion occurs at the cell surface (7Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), a recent study showed that cells producing anchorless PrPC were resistant to scrapie infection (15McNally K.L. Ward A.E. Priola S.A. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 4469-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies employed genetic methods that removed the entire GPI anchor rather than specific modifications of GPI anchors. The GPI anchor targets PrPC to detergent-resistant membrane microdomains that are commonly called lipid rafts and which are necessary for efficient PrPSc formation (12Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Many GPI-anchored molecules transfer between cell membranes, a process called cell painting (16Legler D.F. Doucey M.A. Schneider P. Chapatte L. Bender F.C. Bron C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Medof M.E. Nagarajan S. Tykocinski M.L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The transfer of PrPC between cells in vitro (18Liu T. Li R. Pan T. Liu D. Petersen R.B. Wong B.S. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47671-47678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) showed that cell painting could be used to introduce PrPC with different GPI anchors to recipient cells. In this study, we report the effects of modification of the GPI anchor attached to PrPC on PrPSc formation using a combination of a cell painting technique and PrPC that had been digested by phospholipase A2 (PrPC-G-lyso-PI) or phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PrPC-IPG) (Fig. 1). Prion-infected ScN2a, ScGT1, and SMB cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 2% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To determine the effect of PrPC preparations on PrPSc formation, ScN2a, SMB, or ScGT1 cells were plated in six-well plates at 105 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of test preparations, with daily changes of media, for 7 days. Cells were washed twice in PBS, and extracts were collected. Spent medium was collected and concentrated by centrifugation with a 10-kDa filter (Vivaspin, Sartorius) to examine whether PrPSc was released into culture supernatants. The survival of cells was determined by the addition of 25 μm thiazolyl blue tetrazolium for 3 h and reported as a percentage of untreated cells. Treated ScGT1 cells were detached and counted, washed twice with PBS, frozen, and thawed. Membranes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, washed twice, and homogenized in sterile 0.9% (w/v) saline at 2.5 × 106 cell equivalents/ml. C57/BL mice under halothane anesthesia were injected intracerebrally with 30 μl (7.5 × 104 cell equivalents) of this homogenate. Mice were monitored for clinical signs of scrapie until reaching a predefined clinical end point. All animal work was conducted according to local and national guidelines. Cortical neurons were prepared from the brains of mouse embryos (day 15.5) derived from PrP null mice as described (11Bate C. Salmona M. Diomede L. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14983-14990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and plated at 106 cells/well in six-well plates precoated with poly-l-lysine. Neurons were grown in neurobasal medium containing B27 components (PAA) for 10 days. Neurons were incubated with PrPC preparations for different time periods and washed three times with PBS, and extracts were prepared. In some assays, cells were pulsed with PrPC for 2 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in fresh culture medium for between 24 and 96 h. The amount of PrPC expressed at the cell surface was determined by treating cells with 0.2 units of phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C/106 cells for 1 h at 37 °C, and the amount of PrPC released into the supernatant was measured by ELISA. Treated cells were homogenized in an extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% SDS) at 106 cells/ml, and nuclei and large fragments were removed by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min). Mixed protease inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, aprotinin, leupeptin, bestatin, pepstatin A, and E-46) (Sigma) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture including PP1, PP2A, microcystin LR, cantharidin, and p-bromotetramisole (Sigma) were added to extracts where appropriate. To determine the amount of PrPSc produced, cell extracts/supernatants were digested with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and tested in a PrP ELISA. Cells were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and mixed protease inhibitors at 106 cells/ml. Nuclei and large fragments were removed by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min). The postnuclear supernatant was incubated on ice for 60 min and centrifuged (16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The soluble material contained the normal cell membrane (detergent-resistant membranes). Pellets were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% SDS and mixed protease inhibitors, centrifuged again (16,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant containing the lipid raft constituents was collected. Cultured neurons were harvested with a Teflon scraper and homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 106 cells/ml. Nuclei and membrane fragments were removed by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min). Membranes were washed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and suspended in an ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (as above). 5–40% sucrose solutions were prepared and layered to produce a gradient. Membranes were added and centrifuged (50,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C). Fractions were collected from the bottom of gradients. PrPC was isolated from GT1 neuronal cell membranes that had been homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and mixed protease inhibitors using an affinity column loaded with mAb ICSM35 (d.gen, Inc.). Bound PrPC was digested with 0.2 units/ml phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C extracted from Bacillus cereus (Sigma) to generate PrPC-IPG, or 100 units/ml bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (Sigma) to generate PrPC-G-lyso-PI at 37 °C for 1 h. Digested PrPC preparations were eluted using glycine-HCl, neutralized with 1 m Tris, and isolated via reverse phase chromatography on C18 columns (Waters). Proteins were eluted using a gradient of acetonitrile in water and 0.1% TFA as shown in supplemental Fig. 1A. PrP containing fractions were pooled, desalted, and concentrated. For bioassays, samples were diluted in culture medium and solubilized by sonication. GPIs were isolated from PrPC by digestion with 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 24 h. The released GPIs were extracted with water-saturated butan-1-ol, washed with water, lyophilized, and stored in ethanol at 20 μm. GPIs were examined by high performance thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates and probed with mAb 5AB3-11 that binds to phosphatidylinositol as described (19Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22017-22026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The amount of PrP in samples was measured by ELISA as described (20Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. BMC Biol. 2008; 6: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Maxisorb Immunoplates (Nunc) were coated with mAb ICSM18 (d.gen, Inc.) and blocked with 5% milk powder. Samples were applied and detected with biotinylated mAb ICSM35 (d.gen, Inc.), followed by extravidin-alkaline phosphatase and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm, and the amount of PrP in samples was calculated by reference to a standard curve of recombinant murine PrP (Prionics). The activation of cPLA2 is accompanied by phosphorylation of the serine 505 residue, which creates a unique epitope, and the amount of activated cPLA2 in samples was measured by ELISA as described (20Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. BMC Biol. 2008; 6: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Maxisorb immunoplates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml of mouse mAb anti-cPLA2 (clone CH-7 (Upstate)). Samples were incubated for 1 h, and the amount of activated cPLA2 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antiphospho-cPLA2 (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), extravidin-alkaline phosphatase, and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Samples were expressed as “units of activated cPLA2,” where 100 units was the amount of activated cPLA2 in extracts from 106 untreated cells. To measure cPLA2 protein immunoplates were coated with mAb CH-7, and samples were applied as above. Bound cPLA2 was detected using a goat polyclonal anti-cPLA2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by biotinylated anti-goat IgG, extravidin-alkaline phosphatase, and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Treated cells were solubilized in ice cold 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA 106 cells/ml for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min), and the supernatant was incubated with mAbs to PrP (ICSM35), cPLA2 (CH-7), or isotype controls for 30 min at 4 °C on rollers. Magnetic microbeads containing protein G were added (10 μl/ml) (Miltenyi Biotech) for 30 min, and protein G bound antibody complexes were isolated using a μMACS magnetic system (Miltenyi Biotech.) at 4 °C. To determine PrPSc levels, isolated beads were predigested with 1 μg/ml proteinase K. Samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and separated by PAGE on a 15% gel. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by semi-dry blotting. Membranes were blocked using 10% milk powder. PrP was detected by incubation with mAb ICSM18 (d.gen, Inc.), β-actin by mAb clone AC-74 (Sigma), and cPLA2 by mAb CH-7, followed by a secondary anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase. Bound antibody was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein concentrations were measured using a micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and the amount of cholesterol was measured using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen). The assay was performed after digestion with cholesterol esterase to determine the amount of esterified cholesterol within samples. Comparison of treatment effects was carried out using one-way and two-way analysis of variance. For all statistical tests, significance was set at the 1% level. Control and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C- or PLA2-digested PrPC preparations were isolated by reverse phase chromatography on C18 columns. Mock-treated PrPC containing an intact GPI anchor (PrPC-GPI) was eluted between 68 and 74% acetonitrile, PrPC-G-lyso-PI was eluted between 30 and 36% acetonitrile, whereas PrPC-IPG did not bind (supplemental Fig. 1A). Immunoblots showed that digestion with PLA2 or phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C did not affect the protein or glycan components of PrPC (supplemental Fig. 1B). However, the GPI anchor isolated from PrPC-G-lyso-PI and PrPC-IPG had differed to that isolated from PrPC-GPI (supplemental Fig. 1C). The daily addition of PrPC-GPI increased the amount of PrPSc in ScN2a cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The increased PrPSc formation did not affect the survival of ScN2a cells, for example the addition of 10 ng PrPC-GPI increased PrPSc formation without affecting cell survival (97% cell survival ± 9 compared with 100% ± 7, n = 12, p = 0.7). Immunoblots confirmed ELISA data and showed that the addition of PrPC-GPI increased the PrPSc content of ScN2a cells without affecting the amount of β-actin (Fig. 2B). This effect of PrPC-GPI was not cell-line specific; the daily addition of 10 ng of PrPC-GPI also increased the PrPSc content of ScGT1 and SMB cells (Table 1). The amount of PrPSc in these cells was not altered by the addition of 10 ng PrPC-IPG and was reduced following the addition of 10 ng PrPC-G-lyso-PI. Supernatants were collected to determine whether extracellular PrPSc had been formed during these experiments. The daily addition of 10 ng PrPC-GPI increased the amount of extracellular PrPSc released from ScN2a cells (1.8 ng of PrPSc ± 0.67 compared with 0.38 ng ± 0.29, n = 28, p < 0.05). The addition of 10 ng PrPC-IPG had no affect (0.41 ng of PrPSc ± 0.34 compared with 0.38 ng ± 0.29, n = 28, p = 0.7), and no PrPSc was detected in the supernatants of ScN2a cells incubated with 10 ng PrPC-G-lyso-PI (<0.05 ng of PrPSc).TABLE 1PrPC-G-lyso-PI inhibited the conversion of PrPC to PrPScTreatmentPrPSc (ng/106 cells)ScN2a cellsScGT1 cellsSMB cellsNone1.3 ± 0.49.6 ± 1.45.8 ± 1.2PrPC-GPI8.7 ± 2.319.4 ± 3.115.4 ± 3.3PrPC-IPG1.1 ± 0.48.6 ± 2.25.2 ± 1.3PrPC-G-lyso-PI0.6 ± 0.33.8 ± 1.61.6 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab The inhibitory effect of PrPC-G-lyso-PI on PrPSc formation was studied further. We report that PrPC-G-lyso-PI reduced the PrPSc content of ScN2a cells (Fig. 3A), SMB cells (Fig. 3B), and ScGT1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Immunoblots confirmed that PrPC-G-lyso-PI reduced the PrPSc content of ScGT1 cells without affecting the amount of β-actin (Fig. 3D). The addition of 25 ng PrPC-G-lyso-PI did not affect the survival of ScGT1 cells (101% cell survival ± 9 compared with 100 ± 7, n = 12, p = 0.6). PrPC-G-lyso-PI also reduced the infectivity of ScGT1 cells. Groups of mice were injected intra-cerebrally with homogenates from ScGT1 cells treated for 7 days with 25 ng of PrPC-G-lyso-PI or with a vehicle control. The mean incubation period of mice given the control homogenate was 164 days ± 4 (incubation period ± S.D., n = 13). None of the six mice inoculated with homogenates from cells treated with PrPC-G-lyso-PI had died by day 600, indicating that treatment with PrPC-G-lyso-PI reduced infectivity. The amount of cellular cholesterol affects the formation of PrPSc (11Bate C. Salmona M. Diomede L. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14983-14990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the addition of 10 ng PrPC-GPI, but not PrPC-G-lyso-PI, for 12 h increased the amount of cholesterol in ScN2a cell membranes (Fig. 4A) and reduced the amount of cholesterol esters (Fig. 4B) suggesting that the increase in cholesterol was partially derived from the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters. Pretreatment of cells with 100 μm diethylumbelliferyl phosphate, which inhibits the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters (21Gocze P.M. Freeman D.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2972-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), reduced both the PrPC-GPI-induced increase in cholesterol (613 ng/106 cells ± 38 compared with 727 ± 51, n = 12, p < 0.01), and prevented the reduction in cholesterol esters (Fig. 4B). The addition of 100 μm diethylumbelliferyl phosphate also reduced PrPSc production in ScN2a cells incubated with 10 ng of PrPC-GPI (3.8 ng PrPSc ± 1.4 compared with 8.7 ± 2.3, n = 12, p < 0.01), indicating that the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters provides cholesterol to facilitate PrPSc formation. Cortical neurons derived from PrP null mice were incubated with 10 ng of PrPC to determine the effect of the GPI anchor on the targeting of PrPC. PrPC-GPI and PrPC-G-lyso-PI bound rapidly to cortical neurons, whereas PrPC-IPG did not (Table 2). Although PrPC-GPI was mostly found within detergent-resistant membranes, PrPC-G-lyso-PI was detergent soluble (Table 2). Acylation of the GPI anchor also affected the expression of PrPC at the cell surface; the amount of PrPC-G-lyso-PI at the surface of these cells after 2 h was higher than the amount of PrPC-GPI (8.3 ng PrPC ± 0.8 compared with 3.7 ng ± 0.5, n = 12, p < 0.01). Cortical neurons from PrP null mice were incubated for 2 h with 10 ng of PrPC preparations, and membrane constituents were separated on sucrose density gradients. Although most of the PrPC-GPI was found in low density membranes, PrPC-G-lyso-PI was found in different fractions (Fig. 5A). The targeting of proteins to lipid rafts can affect their trafficking within cells and hence their fate. After PrP null neurons were pulsed with 10 ng PrPC-GPI or PrPC-G-lyso-PI for 2 h PrPC-GPI was rapidly cleared from neurons and was absent after 48 h, whereas PrPC-G-lyso-PI remained in neurons for up to 96 h (Fig. 5B).TABLE 2Acylation of the GPI anchor altered the targeting of PrPC to specific membranesPrPC (ng/106 cells)PrPC-GPIPrPC-IPGPrPC-G-lyso-PITotal9.4 ± 0.9<0.059.2 ± 1.3DRM8.2 ± 0.9<0.052.3 ± 0.4DSM1.1 ± 0.2<0.057.4 ± 1.1Cell surface3.7 ± 0.5<0.058.3 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab As PLA2 is involved in prion formation (22Bate C. Reid S. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36405-36411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the effects of PrPC-G-lyso-PI on cPLA2 were studied. The addition of 25 ng of PrPC-G-lyso-PI for 3 h reduced the amount of activated cPLA2 in ScN2a cells (55 units ± 16 compared with 100 ± 12, n = 12, p < 0.01), ScGT1 cells (38 units ± 14 compared with 100 ± 12, n = 12, p < 0.01), or SMB cells (48 units ± 15 compared with 100 ± 12, n = 15, p < 0.01). Upon activation, cPLA2 migrates to specific membranes utilizing a Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain (23Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradients showed that 3 h after the addition of 25 ng of PrPC-G-lyso-PI to ScN2a cells, a proportion of cPLA2 had relocated (Fig. 6A). Prior studies showed that cPLA2 was found within PrPSc-containing lipid rafts (20Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. BMC Biol. 2008; 6: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We report that pretreatment of ScN2a cells with 25 ng of PrPC-G-lyso-PI for 3 h did not affect the amount of PrPSc precipitated by ICSM35 (Fig. 6B) but reduced the amount of co-precipitated cPLA2 (Fig. 6C), indicating that PrPC-G-lyso-PI caused the dissociation of some cPLA2 from PrP-containing membranes. Conversely, an mAb to cPLA2 (CH-7) precipitated similar amounts of cPLA2 from extracts from control cells and cells incubated with 25 ng of PrPC-G-lyso-PI (Fig. 6E). However, it precipitated less PrPSc from ScN2a cells treated with 25 ng of PrPC-G-lyso-PI than from control cells (1.6 ng of PrPSc ± 1.2 compared with 5.2 ng ± 1.4, n = 9, p < 0.01) and (Fig. 6D). These studies were conducted on cells 3 h after the addition of PrPC-G-lyso-PI and before any differences in the PrPSc content of cells were observed. A cell painting technique was used to demonstrate the effect of the GPI anchor on the targeting of PrPC to specific membranes, cell activation, and on the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. While treating prion-infected cells with PrPC increased PrPSc formation, this effect was lost after the removal of acyl chains from the GPI anchor attached to PrPC. Moreover, the addition of high amounts of PrPC-G-lyso-PI altered membrane domains surrounding PrPSc, reducing the activation of cPLA2, PrPSc formation, and infectivity. The addition of PrPC-IPG did not affect PrPSc formation in cells, a surprising observation considering of a report that transgenic mice producing anchorless PrPC produced large amounts of PrPSc (14Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, the PrPSc produced in those mice was extracellular, and cells producing anchorless PrPC are resistant to scrapie infection (15McNally K.L. Ward A.E. Priola S.A. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 4469-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that PrPC-IPG contains the glycan component of the GPI anchor, whereas the transgenic mice produced PrPC lacking the whole GPI anchor. Although PrPC-G-lyso-PI was readily taken up by cells, we found no evidence that it was converted to PrPSc. Once incorporated into recipient cells, the effects and fate of PrPC-GPI and PrPC-G-lyso-PI were different. Prion formation is dependent upon the amount of cholesterol in cell membranes and whereas the addition of PrPC-GPI increased the amount of cholesterol in membranes, consistent with reports that GPI anchors contain mostly saturated fatty acids, which help to solubilize cholesterol (24Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), the addition of PrPC-G-lyso-PI had no effect. The increase in cholesterol following the addition of PrPC-GPI was reduced by an inhibitor of cholesterol esterase, showing that it was partly derived from the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters. This release of this cholesterol was also necessary for the PrPC-GPI induced PrPSc formation. The amount of cholesterol in cell membranes is important for the formation and function of lipid rafts (25Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). Although both detergent resistance assays and sucrose density gradients showed that PrPC-GPI was found within lipid rafts, most of the PrPC-G-lyso-PI molecules were found within non-raft membranes. The presence of a GPI anchor targets PrPC to cholesterol-dense lipid rafts (12Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 26Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), which is essential for PrPC to PrPSc conversion (11Bate C. Salmona M. Diomede L. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14983-14990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thus, the targeting of PrPC-G-lyso-PI to non-raft membranes suggested that it limited interactions between raft-associated PrPSc and PrPC-G-lyso-PI. PrPC interacts with other membrane molecules, including glycosaminoglycans (27Warner R.G. Hundt C. Weiss S. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18421-18430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the laminin receptor precursor (28Rieger R. Edenhofer F. Lasmézas C.I. Weiss S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (29Parkyn C.J. Vermeulen E.G. Mootoosamy R.C. Sunyach C. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Moestrup S. Liu Q. Bu G. Jen A. Morris R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), or glypican-1 (30Taylor D.R. Whitehouse I.J. Hooper N.M. PLoS. Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The targeting of PrPC-G-lyso-PI to the normal cell membrane may reduce interactions with these proteins, or facilitate interactions with other proteins that alter its trafficking. Differences in the composition of the GPI anchor affect the trafficking of proteins (31Rajendran L. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1099-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Thus, greater amounts of PrPC-G-lyso-PI than PrPC-GPI were expressed at the cell surface, and although PrPC-GPI was rapidly removed from these cells, PrPC-G-lyso-PI remained in neurons for longer. One explanation of these results is that PrPC-G-lyso-PI targets a different membrane domain to PrPC-GPI and consequently most of the PrPC-G-lyso-PI molecules traffic via a pathway that is physically segregated from PrPSc. Although these theories explain why PrPC-G-lyso-PI was not readily converted to PrPSc, a more refined hypothesis is required to explain why the addition of high amounts of PrPC-G-lyso-PI reduced PrPSc production and infectivity. One possibility is that PrPC-G-lyso-PI competed with endogenous PrPC for endocytic partner proteins and consequently altered the trafficking of endogenous PrPC and hence PrPSc formation. Another possibility is that PrPC binds to PrPSc and modifies lipid rafts. The composition and hence function of lipid rafts is dynamic and controlled by an induced fit model (32Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Because PrPC-G-lyso-PI did not sequester cholesterol, the membrane surrounding a complex between PrPSc and PrPC-G-lyso-PI would contain less cholesterol than membranes formed following the interaction between PrPSc and PrPC-GPI. Thus, the binding of PrPC-G-lyso-PI to PrPSc may reduce the cholesterol content of local membranes to a level below that required for the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. This hypothesis is consistent with observations that formation of PrPSc was affected by the lipid composition of membranes (33Graham J.F. Agarwal S. Kurian D. Kirby L. Pinheiro T.J. Gill A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9868-9880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that lipids were essential co-factors in prion formation (34Wang F. Wang X. Yuan C.G. Ma J. Science. 2010; 327: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that PrPC-G-lyso-PI is converted to PrPSc-G-lyso-PI, which in turn acts as an inefficient template for PrPC to PrPSc conversion (35Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. Biochem. J. 2010; 428: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are enriched with signaling molecules, which suggests that they act as domains in which the GPI anchors attached to PrPC interact with cell signaling pathways (36Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5207) Google Scholar). The activation of PLA2 is required for PrPSc formation (22Bate C. Reid S. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36405-36411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and in prion-infected cells, cPLA2 co-localized with PrPSc-containing lipid rafts (20Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. BMC Biol. 2008; 6: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Such observations suggest that PrPC-GPI binds to PrPSc in cholesterol-dense lipid rafts, where it activates cPLA2 and facilitates the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. The addition of PrPC-G-lyso-PI reduced activation of cPLA2 in prion-infected cell lines. Notably, the addition of PrPC-G-lyso-PI reduced the amount of cPLA2 within PrPSc-containing lipid rafts. We propose that the binding of PrPC-G-lyso-PI to PrPSc changed the composition of the underlying membrane so that it no longer captured cPLA2. Upon activation, cPLA2 migrated to intracellular membranes utilizing a Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain (23Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the targeting of cPLA2 to membranes containing their endogenous substrates can regulate cell signaling. Thus, the targeting of cPLA2 to specific membranes is essential for the formation of second messengers such as platelet-activating factor that facilitate PrPSc formation (22Bate C. Reid S. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36405-36411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that the addition of PrPC-G-lyso-PI to prion-infected cells altered the location of cPLA2. More specifically, it caused the dissociation of cPLA2 from PrPSc, reduced activation of cPLA2 and hindered the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. The activation of cPLA2 is essential to the maintenance of the Golgi network (37de Figueiredo P. Drecktrah D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Strang M. Brown W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8642-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is involved in the trafficking of a GFP-tagged PrPC (38Magalhães A.C. Silva J.A. Lee K.S. Martins V.R. Prado V.F. Ferguson S.S. Gomez M.V. Brentani R.R. Prado M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33311-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, altering the GPI anchor attached to PrPC may reduce the activation of cPLA2 and alter the trafficking of PrPC away from specific sites conducive to prion formation. In conclusion, we showed that the addition of PrPC-G-lyso-PI reduced the activation of cPLA2 and PrPSc formation in prion-infected cells. We propose that the chemical composition of the GPI anchor is a factor that targets PrPC to sites conducive to conversion to PrPSc. Moreover, these results raise the possibility that drugs, which alter the structure of the PrPC-GPI anchor, may provide novel treatments for prion diseases.

Here, we demonstrate that the growth factor midkine interacts with LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) at high affinity (Kd value, 2.7 nm) not only at the cell surface but also within the secretory pathway during biosynthesis. The latter premature ligand-receptor interaction resulted in aggregate formation and consequently suppressed midkine secretion and LRP1 maturation. We utilized an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval signal and an LRP1 fragment, which strongly bound to midkine and the LRP1-specialized chaperone receptor-associated protein (RAP), to construct an ER trapper. The ER trapper efficiently trapped midkine and RAP and mimicked the premature ligand-receptor interaction, i.e. suppressed maturation of the ligand and receptor. The ER trapper also diminished the inhibitory function of LRP1 on platelet-derived growth factor-mediated cell migration. Complementary to these results, an increased expression of RAP was closely associated with midkine expression in human colorectal carcinomas (33 of 39 cases examined). Our results suggest that the premature ligand-receptor interaction plays a role in protein production within the secretory pathway.

Our results suggest that the premature ligand-receptor interaction plays a role in protein production within the secretory pathway. Protein production within the secretory pathway is tightly regulated by complex but organized processes, which include folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumAPPamyloid precursor proteinLRP1LDL receptor-related protein 1MKmidkinemLRPmini-LRPRAPreceptor-associated protein. glycosylation, and vesicular transport to the cell surface through the ER and Golgi apparatus. Although these processes play important roles in quality control and maturation of proteins, it is not fully understood how production of proteins in the secretory pathway is regulated. This regulation mechanism is also important to understand some diseases, as disorganized production of growth factors can be causative events in some pathological conditions, such as cancer (1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1992; 117: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A fundamental question yet to be carefully addressed is whether a ligand and its receptor come into contact during their biosyntheses. To address this, we focused on two molecules in the present study, the growth factor midkine (MK) and its receptor low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). endoplasmic reticulum amyloid precursor protein LDL receptor-related protein 1 midkine mini-LRP receptor-associated protein. MK is a heparin-binding growth factor, which was originally discovered as the product of a retinoic acid-responsive gene (2Kadomatsu K. Tomomura M. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1312-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 3Tomomura M. Kadomatsu K. Matsubara S. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10765-10770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MK and pleiotrophin/heparin-binding growth-associated molecule form a family distinct from other heparin-binding growth factor families (4Rauvala H. Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Kaksonen M. Kinnunen T.

MK plays important biological roles mainly in four areas, i.e. cancer, inflammation, neuro- and myocardioprotection, and hypertension. To date, the biological functions in which MK has been implicated are all attributable to the secreted form of MK, and thus exogenous MK reverses phenotypes observed in MK-deficient mice. For example, MK-deficient mice are more resistant to vascular restenosis and hypertension associated with chronic kidney disease, whereas exogenous MK promotes these pathogeneses (7Horiba M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamura E. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Hayashi K. Yuzawa Y. Matsuo S. Kuzuya M. Kaname T. Hirai M. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Clin.

It is noteworthy that not only MK expression in carcinoma tissues but also the blood MK level is increased in cancer patients (9Tsutsui J. Kadomatsu K. Matsubara S. Nakagawara A. Hamanoue M. Takao S. Shimazu H. Ohi Y. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1281-1285PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ikematsu S. Yano A. Aridome K. Kikuchi M. Kumai H. Nagano H. Okamoto K. Oda M. Sakuma S. Aikou T. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Both the MK expression level and MK blood level are closely related to clinical outcome (11Nakagawara A. Milbrandt J. Muramatsu T. Deuel T.F. Zhao H. Cnaan A. Brodeur G.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1792-1797PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mashour G.A. Ratner N. Khan G.A. Wang H.L. Martuza R.L. Kurtz A.

Cancer. 2003; 88: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MK expression knockdown leads to tumor growth suppression (14Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar, 15Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Goto T. Muramatsu T. Cancer. 2006; 107: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the MK secreted by cancer cells plays a critical role in cancer progression. LRP1 is a large endocytosis receptor belonging to the LDL receptor family (16Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Because LRP1 recognizes many different ligands, the physiological roles of LRP1 govern a diverse array of biological functions, including metabolism of lipoproteins and proteinases, cellular entry of viruses and toxins, activation of lysosomal enzymes, and neurotransmission. Disruption of the LRP1 gene is embryonic-lethal, supporting the fundamental role of LRP1 in development (17Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a specialized ER chaperone for members of the LDL receptor family (18Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 19Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Maturation of LRP1 is severely impaired in RAP-deficient mice, supporting an important role of RAP in the biosynthesis of LRP1 (20Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). LRP1 is a receptor for MK and is required for MK-mediated cell survival (21Muramatsu H. Zou K. Sakaguchi N. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Shibata Y. Muramatsu T. Hirai M. Inui T. Kimura T. Saito H. McCormick L.M. Bu G. Kadomatsu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6788-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because MK and LRP1 are produced simultaneously in most cancer cell lines, this ligand and receptor are produced in the same secretory pathway. Therefore, this is a good model to investigate the regulatory mechanism of protein production in an autocrine secretory pathway. Here, we developed a new method, ER trapping, which simultaneously suppressed MK secretion and LRP1 maturation. Utilizing this and other techniques, we found that MK interacted with LRP1 not only on the cell surface but also in the secretory pathway during their biosyntheses. We named the latter interaction the premature ligand-receptor interaction. We found that the premature ligand-receptor interaction plays a negative regulatory role in the production of MK and LRP1 within the secretory pathway. Avoiding this premature interaction may allow cancer cells to overproduce a growth factor and may be a strategy of those cells for survival and expansion. CHO K1 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. TGW cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO-mini-LRP (mLRP)-I, -mLRP-II, -mLRP-III, -mLRP-IV, and -mLRP-IVm cells and a series of mLRP expression vectors were generated as described previously (23Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P.

The expression vector for mouse RAP tagged with the FLAG epitope at the C terminus was constructed in pIRES-EGFP (Clontech). The expression vector for human MK was constructed in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To generate an ER expression vector (ER-TRAP) for a peptide that contained SLRP2N-EGF (25Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I.

Anti-HA and -FLAG antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively. Anti-calnexin and anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)-100) antibodies were from Stressgen and Cell Signaling, respectively. Radioiodination of MK was performed as described previously (22Shibata Y.

The specific activity obtained was ∼5 × 107 cpm/μg. For chemical cross-linking, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium (PBS+) as well as 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA), and supplied with 5 ml of ice-cold DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then incubated with 125I-labeled MK (2 × 107 cpm) at 4 °C for 2 h by gentle rotation. After washing with PBS-BSA three times and PBS+ once, 5 ml of PBS+ was added. The cross-linking was begun by adding the water-soluble (BS3; Pierce) or -insoluble (DSS; Pierce) cross-linker at a final concentration of 0.27 mm and incubating at 4 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with detaching buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mm PMSF). Cells were scraped in 500 μl of detaching buffer, collected by centrifuge, and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6% CHAPS, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mm PMSF). For in vitro cross-linking, 10 μl of protein solution dialyzed against appropriate buffers was mixed with 2 μl of 125I-labeled MK (∼10 ng) and was incubated at 20 °C for 1 h. Cross-linking was started by adding 0.2 μl of 20 mm DSS or BS3 and incubating at 4 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 4.5 μl of Laemmli 4 × sample buffer. Cells grown in a 10-cm dish were lysed with 0.5 ml of 1% Triton in PBS+ and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant (0.3 ml) was layered on a stepwise sucrose gradient (60% 0.5 ml, 25% 1 ml, 20% 1 ml, 10% 1 ml, and 5% 1 ml in 0.1% Triton in PBS+) in a centrifuge tube (326819 tube; Beckman) and centrifuged at 130,000 × g at 17 °C for 19 h (SW50.1 rotor; Beckman). Fractionation was performed by collecting 7 drops/fraction from the bottom of the tube. After the first immunoprecipitation, the immunoprecipitates were suspended in 100 μl of 1% SDS in the lysis buffer, boiled for 3 min, and diluted with 1 ml of the lysis buffer. This solution was then subjected to the second immunoprecipitation. The expression vector for MK-TRAP-Fc was generated in pFUSE-Fc (Invivogen) and transfected into HEK293T cells. After 5 days, the conditioned media were collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. A 24-ml aliquot of the supernatants was loaded onto protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and washed with 30 ml of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The bound fraction was eluted with 3.6 ml of 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 3.0) and neutralized immediately with 0.4 ml of 1.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). The purified protein was desalted with PD-10 (GE Healthcare) and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 device (MWCO 3000; Millipore). A 100-μl aliquot of MK-TRAP-Fc solution was immobilized on a 96-well assay plate by incubating overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS, and varying concentrations of AP-MK were applied. After 90 min at room temperature, unbound AP-MK was washed out by washing five times with HBHA buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA in Hanks' balanced salt solution). Bound AP-MK was estimated by enzymatic assay using p-nitrophenylphosphate as a substrate. The procedures and sources of sample collection under informed consent were as described previously (26Ye C. Qi M. Fan Q.W. Ito K. Akiyama S. Kasai Y. Matsuyama M. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from colorectal tissues with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). cDNA was obtained using a SuperScript III cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with a TaqMan probe and ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemotaxicells (8-μm pore; Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) were coated, unless otherwise indicated, on the underside surface with 1 μg/ml collagen I in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Harvested cells were washed with 10% FBS/DMEM once and 0.4% FBS/DMEM once, then suspended at 4 × 105 cells/ml in 0.4% FBS/DMEM. Collagen I-coated chambers were inserted into wells of a 24-well plate, where each well contained 600 μl of 0.2% BSA and 0.4% FBS/DMEM with or without 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB, and preincubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells (100 μl) were added to each insert and incubated for 4 h in a CO2 incubator. Migrating cells were counted at 200 × magnification for five fields/chamber. Experiments were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate for each condition, with the numbers of migrating cells being presented as the average ± S.E. SW620 cells were transfected with siRNA (siGENOME; Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates, and then the medium was switched to 0.5% FBS/F12-K. Viable cells were estimated with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (DOJINDO). LRP1 consists of two heterodimeric subunits that are produced through furin-mediated processing in the trans-Golgi (Fig. 1A). The larger chain (α chain) is extracellular and contains four ligand-binding domains (clusters of ligand-binding repeats). The shorter chain (β chain) contains the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. LRP1 was previously identified as a protein bound to the MK-affinity column (21Muramatsu H. Zou K. Sakaguchi N. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To clarify the physical association between these two molecules on the cell surface, here we used several membrane-bound mLRP constructs (Fig. 1A) (23Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Li Y. Osaka H. FitzGerald D.J. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference between mLRP-IV and mLRP-IVm is that the latter contains a mutation in the intracellular domain. Each mLRP protein carries an HA tag near its N terminus. Each construct was transfected into LRP1-deficient CHO cells. Cells were then incubated with 125I-labeled MK and treated with a water-insoluble chemical cross-linker, DSS. As shown in Fig. 1B, a discrete cross-linked band appeared in wild-type CHO cells (K1) but not in LRP1-deficient CHO cells (LRP1−/−). Notably, mLRP-II, -IV, and -IVm-expressing cells showed two cross-linked bands. The upper one represents the unprocessed protein that contains both α and β chains, whereas the lower band is the processed α chain. Because a small fraction of the unprocessed protein is localized on the cell surface, 3G. Bu, unpublished data. the cross-linked pattern shown in Fig. 1B suggests that MK binds to the cell surface α chain containing either the second or fourth ligand-binding domains. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody confirmed that the cross-linked bands indeed contained the HA-tagged α chain of each mLRP (Fig. 1C). A water-soluble cross-linker, BS3, showed the same results (data not shown). Therefore, these data collectively suggest that MK specifically binds to cell surface LRP1. These data were also consistent with our previous finding in experiments using soluble LRP1 fragments: the N-terminal halves of the second and fourth ligand-binding domains in the LRP1 moiety show the highest affinity to MK (27Chen S. Bu G. Takei Y. Sakamoto K. Ikematsu S. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We further performed Scatchard plot analysis to reveal the affinity between MK and the N-terminal half of the second ligand-binding domain of LRP1 (formerly designated MK-TRAP; Fig. 1A). Indeed, MK and MK-TRAP showed a high affinity with a Kd value of 2.7 nm (Fig. 1, D and E). We next investigated the role of LRP1 in MK production in the secretory pathway by comparing LRP1-deficient and mLRP-IV-expressing cells. In mLRP-IV-expressing cells, co-expression of MK and the LRP1 chaperone RAP enhanced MK secretion into the medium compared with MK expression alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6, Medium, MK). In contrast, the effect of RAP on MK secretion was not seen in LRP1-deficient cells (LRP1−/−) (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3, Medium, MK). MK retention in the cell appeared to be reduced by co-expression with RAP (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6, Cells, MK). Furthermore, translocation of mLRP-IV to the cell surface of MK-expressing cells was significantly reduced compared with that in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). This phenomenon was also restored by co-expression of RAP (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 9). When MK was co-expressed with GFP in mLRP-IV-expressing cells, the intracellular MK was densely stained in nearly detaching, round-shaped cells (Fig. 2B, top row, arrowhead), whereas MK staining became faint by RAP expression (Fig. 2B, middle row, arrowheads). Intracellular localization of MK overlapped that of mLRP-IV (Fig. 2B, bottom row). Together, these results suggest that LRP1 is essential for intracellular retention of MK during biosynthesis: this retention is probably due to intracellular interaction between MK and LRP1. Because MK was originally discovered as a retinoic acid-responsive gene product (2Kadomatsu K. Tomomura M. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1312-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), we next investigated endogenous MK protein production using this reagent. Retinoic acid induced MK mRNA expression and consequently intracellular MK protein production in TGW cells, a neuroblastoma cell line (Fig. 2C, RNA and Cell). However, surprisingly, it did not enhance MK protein secretion (Fig. 2C, Medium). After retinoic acid treatment, LRP1 was detected not only on the cell surface (Fig. 2D, arrows), but also as a densely stained intracellular body in nearly detaching, round-shaped cells (Fig. 2D, arrowheads). MK was similarly stained in round cells (Fig. 2D), with a pattern reminiscent of MK staining in CHO-mLRP-IV cells (Fig. 2B). The detaching, round-shaped cells were thought to be in a state of anoikis, cell death triggered by detachment from the matrix (28Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). We then tested the effect of RAP on retinoic acid-induced cell death. This chaperone was expected to relieve the ligand-receptor aggregation, based on the results of Fig. 2, A and B. Indeed, RAP overexpression significantly reduced cell death (Fig. 2E). We next examined the effect of MK expression on LRP1 maturation. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling revealed that the unprocessed (immature) mLRP-IV appeared first (Fig. 3A, open arrow), and then the processed (mature) mLRP-IV (α and β chains) increased after 60–90-min chase (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3, asterisks). This profile indicates that the furin-mediated cleavage of immature LRP1 gives rise to mature LRP1, which is consequently presented on the cell surface. A forced expression of MK strongly suppressed LRP1 maturation (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6). However, if RAP was co-expressed with MK, LRP1 maturation was restored (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–12). It is known that LRP1 aggregates are formed via intermolecular disulfide bonds and appear at the top of the separation gel under nonreducing conditions (29Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22374-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, the aggregates increased in cells expressing MK alone but decreased in cells co-expressing MK and RAP (Fig. 3A, Nonreducing). Taken together, these data suggest that the intracellular MK-LRP1 interaction affects LRP1 maturation. We next addressed the question of whether or not both MK and LRP1 were involved in aggregate formation. In a sucrose density gradient segregation of cellular proteins, bands at the top of the separation gel and smears underneath were detected in void fractions that contained higher molecular mass proteins under a nonreducing condition (Fig. 3B, fractions 1–5). It has previously been shown that the unprocessed and processed mLRP-IV bands migrate separately under a nonreducing condition (29Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22374-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and in the present study these bands were detected in fractions 5–11 (open arrow and asterisk, respectively). MK was detected in the first fraction in addition to the later fractions under the reducing condition, suggesting that MK was also a component of the aggregates (Fig. 3B). To examine the MK-LRP association, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP). When pulse-chase-labeled proteins were precipitated with anti-HA antibody (namely, mLRP-IV was precipitated), the unprocessed and processed mLRP-IV were detected at the 90-min chase (open arrow and asterisks, respectively in Fig. 3C, lane 6). In contrast, anti-MK antibody co-precipitated the unprocessed mLRP-IV but not the processed one at the 90-min chase (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Importantly, when RAP was co-expressed with MK, the MK-mLRP association was strongly suppressed (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). Fig. 3, B and C, suggests that MK and immature LRP1 formed a complex during biosynthesis. To confirm the MK-immature LRP association further, pulse-chase-labeled proteins were sequentially immunoprecipitated by two different antibodies. Fig. 3D shows that RAP formed a complex with immature mLRP-IV but not mature mLRP-IV (Fig. 3D, lane 2). Similarly, the general ER chaperone calnexin as well as MK alone was associated with immature mLRP-IV (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4). As shown in Fig. 1E, the N-terminal half of the second ligand-binding domain of LRP1 (MK-TRAP) has a high affinity for MK. MK-TRAP traps extracellular MK, blocks MK binding to cell surface LRP1, and consequently suppresses MK function (27Chen S. Bu G. Takei Y. Sakamoto K. Ikematsu S. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We next utilized this fragment to investigate the biological role of the immature ligand-receptor interaction during biosynthesis. To this end, MK-TRAP was connected with an ER-retrieval signal found in RAP (the amino acid sequence is HNEL), so that MK-TRAP was retained in the ER. We named this construct ER-TRAP (Fig. 1A). Because RAP also shows high affinity for the LRP fragment corresponding to MK-TRAP (25Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), ER-TRAP was expected to trap both MK and RAP in the ER, leading to the suppression of MK secretion and LRP1 maturation. As shown in Fig. 4A, MK-TRAP could be detected in both the cell and the medium, whereas ER-TRAP was only detected in the cell, indicating that ER-TRAP was properly produced as expected. Immunoprecipitation revealed that ER-TRAP bound to both MK and RAP (Fig. 4B). ER-TRAP almost completely trapped MK in the cell, leading to cessation of MK secretion, whereas RAP reversed this phenomenon (Fig. 4C). ER-TRAP also significantly suppressed endogenous MK secretion in the osteosarcoma cell line, UMR106 (data not shown). We next examined the effect of ER-TRAP on endogenous LRP1 production. NIH3T3 cells are known to express endogenous LRP1 but not MK. ER-TRAP strongly suppressed the cell surface LRP1 production, as estimated by immunoprecipitation after cell surface biotinylation (Fig. 4D). To evaluate the biological significance of this phenomenon, we next examined PDGF-mediated migration because LRP1 is known to suppress PDGF receptor β function, as revealed by a study in which vascular smooth muscle cell-specific knock-out of LRP1 induced increased phosphorylation of PDGF receptor β and enhanced atherosclerosis (30Boucher P. Gotthardt M. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Herz J. Science. 2003; 300: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Although PDGF-BB did not significantly induce migration of NIH3T3 cells when administered alone, it did so in the presence of coated collagen I (Fig. 4E). ER-TRAP-transfected cells showed significantly enhanced migration compared with vector-transfected cells, whereas no difference was observed in collagen I-mediated migration (Fig. 4E). Moreover, PDGF receptor β phosphorylation in response to exogenous PDGF-BB was induced to a larger extent in ER-TRAP-transfected cells compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that reduction of cell surface LRP1 reverses LRP1-mediated suppression of PDGF receptor β function. Human carcinomas frequently overproduce MK, and serum MK levels are elevated in cancer patients (9Tsutsui J. Kadomatsu K. Matsubara S. Nakagawara A. Hamanoue M. Takao S. Shimazu H. Ohi Y.

Based on our findings, we hypothesized that a mechanism preventing MK-LRP1 intracellular aggregation is involved in carcinogenesis. We examined the protein expression of MK and RAP in human colorectal carcinomas and corresponding adjacent normal tissues. In most of the cases examined (33 of 39), MK and RAP were strongly expressed in carcinoma tissues (Fig. 5, A left, and B). As controls for MK (a ligand of LRP1) and RAP (an ER chaperone), apolipoprotein E (apoE) and calnexin, respectively, were also examined. These control molecules did not show any difference of expression between carcinoma and adja"
https://openalex.org/W2033148119,"Lombricine kinase is a member of the phosphagen kinase family and a homolog of creatine and arginine kinases, enzymes responsible for buffering cellular ATP levels. Structures of lombricine kinase from the marine worm Urechis caupo were determined by x-ray crystallography. One form was crystallized as a nucleotide complex, and the other was substrate-free. The two structures are similar to each other and more similar to the substrate-free forms of homologs than to the substrate-bound forms of the other phosphagen kinases. Active site specificity loop 309-317, which is disordered in substrate-free structures of homologs and is known from the NMR of arginine kinase to be inherently dynamic, is resolved in both lombricine kinase structures, providing an improved basis for understanding the loop dynamics. Phosphagen kinases undergo a segmented closing on substrate binding, but the lombricine kinase ADP complex is in the open form more typical of substrate-free homologs. Through a comparison with prior complexes of intermediate structure, a correlation was revealed between the overall enzyme conformation and the substrate interactions of His(178). Comparative modeling provides a rationale for the more relaxed specificity of these kinases, of which the natural substrates are among the largest of the phosphagen substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2044318308,"The accurate decoding of the genetic information by the ribosome relies on the communication between the decoding center of the ribosome, where the tRNA anticodon interacts with the codon, and the GTPase center of EF-Tu, where GTP hydrolysis takes place. In the A/T state of decoding, the tRNA undergoes a large conformational change that results in a more open, distorted tRNA structure. Here we use a real-time transient fluorescence quenching approach to monitor the timing and the extent of the tRNA distortion upon reading cognate or near-cognate codons. The tRNA is distorted upon codon recognition and remains in that conformation until the tRNA is released from EF-Tu, although the extent of distortion gradually changes upon transition from the pre- to the post-hydrolysis steps of decoding. The timing and extent of the rearrangement is similar on cognate and near-cognate codons, suggesting that the tRNA distortion alone does not provide a specific switch for the preferential activation of GTP hydrolysis on the cognate codon. Thus, although the tRNA plays an active role in signal transmission between the decoding and GTPase centers, other regulators of signaling must be involved.

Proteins are synthesized from aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) 2The abbreviation used is: aa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNA. that are delivered to the ribosome in ternary complexes with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The ribosome selects aa-tRNAs according to the sequence of codons in the mRNA template and rejects the bulk of aa-tRNAs with anticodons that do not match the given codon in each round of elongation. Correct base pairing between the mRNA codon and the anticodon of the tRNA on the 30S subunit of the ribosome provides a signal that is then transmitted to the GTPase center of EF-Tu on the 50S subunit and results in the activation of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu. Mismatches in the codon-anticodon complex impair GTPase activation, thereby allowing the ribosome to reject incorrect ternary complexes prior to GTP hydrolysis. Deciphering the mechanism and the specificity of signal transmission between the decoding center and the GTPase center of EF-Tu is one of the central questions in understanding the fidelity of translation. aminoacyl-tRNA. Decoding entails a number of elemental steps. Initial binding of the ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA to the ribosome takes place codon-independently, mainly through contacts of EF-Tu with ribosomal protein L7/12, and is followed by rapid and reversible codon reading (Fig. 1A; reviewed in Refs. 1Rodnina M.V.

The formation of the fully complementary codon-anticodon duplex induces local and global conformational changes at the decoding center of the ribosome, which lock the aa-tRNA in the codon-bound state and activate EF-Tu for rapid GTP hydrolysis (5Gromadski K.B.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3800-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Binding of near-cognate ternary complexes that entail single mismatches between codon and anticodon does not induce these structural rearrangements or rapid GTP hydrolysis, explaining why initial tRNA selection is more accurate than can be accounted for by the energetic differences between fully matched and mismatched codon-anticodon pairs alone. Hydrolysis of GTP and dissociation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) leads to a conformational rearrangement of EF-Tu, which is followed by the release of aa-tRNA from EF-Tu·GDP and the dissociation of the factor from the ribosome (9Kothe U. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12767-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Aa-tRNA is then either accommodated in the peptidyl transferase center or rejected in a proofreading mechanism. Following codon recognition and prior to the release from EF-Tu, the aa-tRNA is bound in the so-called A/T state in which it transiently assumes a conformation that is more open or distorted compared with the unbound tRNA (10Schuette J.C.

The important role of the tRNA distortion is to pull EF-Tu into its productive, GTPase-activated conformation (12Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C. Gao Y.G. Murphy 4th, F.V. Weir J.R.

It is attractive to speculate that the tRNA distortion might be a key regulator of signaling between the decoding site and the GTP binding site of EF-Tu. Mismatches in the codon-anticodon complex might impair or abrogate the tRNA distortion; as a result, the GTPase conformation of EF-Tu would not be induced; hence the slow GTP hydrolysis in a near-cognate complex. In fact, the physical properties of the tRNA body are important for accurate decoding (16Cochella L. Green R. Science. 2005; 308: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 17Schultz D.W.

Here we compare the formation of the transient distorted tRNA intermediate upon reading cognate or near-cognate codons. We took advantage of a rearrangement in the D stem of aa-tRNA resulting in the ∼5 Å displacements in the distorted tRNA in the A/T state on a cognate codon (12Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C.

A fluorescence reporter group, proflavin, inserted at positions 16/17 in the D loop produces a fluorescent signal upon codon recognition (20Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The effect can be explained by partial unstacking of proflavin from the neighboring guanines at positions 15 and 18 (20Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which releases the fluorophore from static quenching (21Wintermeyer W. Zachau H.G. Eur. J.

Titrations with fluorescence quencher were done in buffer A containing KI (suprapur grade, Merck) as indicated and KCl, keeping the concentration of KI + KCl constant at 150 mm. Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 7 mm MgCl2) was used for the preparation of initiation and ternary complexes. Ribosomes, EF-Tu, and fMet-tRNAfMet from Escherichia coli were prepared as described (5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol.

The mRNAs (28 nucleotides long) with a UUC (cognate) or CUC (near-cognate) codon following the AUG start codon were purchased from Microsynth. The preparation of proflavin-labeled yeast tRNAPhe proceeds in two steps: reduction of the dihydroU base at position 16/17 in the D loop by borohydride treatment followed by the attachment of proflavin (21Wintermeyer W. Zachau H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). tRNAPhe (10 A260 units/ml in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) was mixed with NaBH4 solution (100 mg in 1 ml of KOH). After incubation for 30 min at 0 °C in the dark, the reaction was stopped by the addition of acetic acid to pH 4–5, and the tRNA was precipitated with cold ethanol and 0.3 m potassium acetate (pH 4.5). Ethanol precipitation was repeated 3–4 times to remove traces of borohydride. Proflavin labeling was carried out by adding borohydride-treated tRNAPhe to 3 mm proflavin in 0.1 m sodium acetate pH 4.3. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9) to pH 7.5. Free dye was removed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Incorporation of proflavin was quantified photometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and 460 nm. For fully labeled tRNA, the A460:A260 ratio is 0.055. Initiation complexes were formed in buffer B by incubating ribosomes (1 μm), mRNA (3 μm), f[3H]Met-tRNAfMet (1.5 μm), IF1, IF2, IF3 (1.5 μm each), and GTP (1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C, and purified by centrifugation through a 1.1 m sucrose cushion in buffer B (400 μl) for 2 h at 259,000 × g in a Beckmann Optima Max-XP ultracentrifuge at 4 °C. After centrifugation, pellets were dissolved in buffer B, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf) was prepared by incubating EF-Tu (wild-type or H84A mutant) (50 μm), GTP (1 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (3 mm), pyruvate kinase (0.05 mg/ml), tRNAPhe(Prf) (25 μm), CTP (1 mm), ATP (3 mm), [14C]phenylalanine (40 μm), nucleotidyl-terminal transferase and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (0.5% v/v each) in buffer B containing 20 mm MgCl2 and purified by gel filtration on 2× Superdex 75 HR columns (GE Healthcare) in buffer B. Ternary complex and initiation complexes were adjusted to buffer A immediately before the experiments. Fluorescence stopped-flow experiments were performed using a SX-20MV apparatus (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK), monitoring proflavin fluorescence. Excitation was at 463 nm and the fluorescence was measured after passing a 500-nm cutoff filter (KV 500, Schott). Time courses were measured at pseudo-first-order conditions in excess of initiation complexes (1 μm) over ternary complexes (0.2 μm) and were evaluated by fitting an exponential function, F = F∞ + A × exp(−kapp×t). If necessary, additional exponential terms were included. The differential amplitudes obtained at different KI concentrations were fitted according to the Stern-Volmer equation in the form of Equation 1, A0−A=A0×(1−1/(1+KSV×[KI]))(Eq. 1) to yield Stern-Volmer constants, KSV, for collisional quenching. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Fluorolog-3 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrofluorimeter. Excitation was at 463 nm and the emission was measured at 502 nm; the KSV values were calculated as described (25Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 57-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Calculations were performed using TableCurve (Jandel Scientific) or Prism (Graphpad Software). Modeling of reaction intermediates was performed in Scientist (Micromath) based on the following kinetic scheme in Equation 2, IC+TC⇄k−1k1A⇄k−2k2B→k3C→k4Dk7↘→k5EF(Eq. 2) where ternary complex (TC) and initiation complex (IC) form the initial binding complex A, which is converted to codon recognition complex B. C represents the state after GTPase activation and GTP hydrolysis, D the state after phosphate release from EF-Tu, and E the state after accommodation of the aa-tRNA into the A site. F represents the proofreading pathway, in which aa-tRNA is rejected from the ribosome. For the cognate ternary complex, the following rate constants were used: k1 = 140 μm−1 s−1 and k−1 = 85 s−1 for initial binding, k2 = 190 s−1 and k−2 = 0.23 s−1 for codon recognition, k3 = 260 s−1 for GTPase activation and GTP hydrolysis and k5 = 23 s−1 for the accommodation and peptide bond formation (5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The rate of Pi release (k4 = 10 s−1, data not shown) was measured for the present conditions as described (9Kothe U. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12767-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the near-cognate ternary complexes, k1 = 140 μm−1 s−1, k−1 = 85 s−1, k2 = 190 s−1, k−2 = 80 s−1, and k3 = 0.1 s−1 were used (Ref. 5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar and data not shown). The k5 and k7 values for the accommodation and rejection of the near-cognate tRNA could not be determined at HiFi conditions, because the GTPase activation is strongly rate limiting. Because the efficiency of proofreading is essentially the same in HiFi (5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and the buffer with 10 mm Mg2+ (8Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3800-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the values from the latter work were used, k5 = 0.1 s−1 and k7 = 6 s−1. The concentration of IC and TC used for modeling were the same as in the biochemical experiments, 1 μm and 0.2 μm, respectively. To assess the extent of tRNA distortion at the D loop, the binding of the ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf) to the ribosome was followed in a stopped-flow apparatus, monitoring proflavin fluorescence in the presence of increasing concentrations of the fluorescence quencher KI, while keeping the ionic strength constant. Changes of proflavin fluorescence report the transient formation of several intermediates of decoding (20Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). If the fluorescence in all intermediates were quenched to the same extent, then the relative amplitudes of the various kinetic steps would be expected to be the same in the presence or the absence of the quencher (Fig. 1B). Alternatively, if the fluorescence of a certain intermediate would be quenched more than that of other states, this would indicate a higher exposure of the fluorophore and hence a more open tRNA conformation in that intermediate. To determine the quenching constant of an intermediate, the time courses obtained in the presence of various concentrations of KI (denoted as I) are subtracted from the one obtained without quencher (I0). The resulting differential curves (I0 − I) can be deconvoluted into exponential terms which are characterized by the apparent rate constants (kapp) and amplitudes (A0 − A) of the respective steps. To determine the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, KSV, which depends on the accessibility of the fluorophore for the quencher and, therefore, is a measure for the “openness” of the tRNA, the differential amplitudes of each step were plotted against the concentration of KI, and the plots were evaluated according to the Stern-Volmer relationship (Equation 1 in “Experimental Procedures”). The transient fluorescence quenching approach is particularly suitable for the analysis of transient intermediates in rapid, forward-committed reactions, such as the EF-Tu-dependent aa-tRNA binding to the A site. Other advantages of the transient quenching approach are the possibilities (i) to isolate a distorted tRNA intermediate from the coexisting ensemble of states that are not distorted as the reaction proceeds and (ii) to selectively monitor those tRNAs that bind to the ribosome, because only those contribute to fluorescence changes. We first monitored the changes of the tRNA conformation that take place upon reading a cognate codon. The ternary complex, EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf), was mixed with the ribosomal initiation complex, 70S·mRNA· fMet-tRNAfMet exposing a cognate UUC codon in the A site and the changes in Prf fluorescence were monitored (Fig. 2A). As observed previously, the proflavin fluorescence transiently increased during the time course of the reaction. According to our previous detailed step assignment, the fluorescence increase reflects all steps starting from ternary complex binding to the ribosome up to GTPase activation (5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The decrease in fluorescence coincides with Pi release from EF-Tu following GTP hydrolysis, the release of the aa-tRNA from EF-Tu, and the subsequent accommodation of the aa-tRNA in the A site (Fig. 1A). When the stopped-flow experiments were carried out in the presence of KI, the fluorescence of Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf) in both initial and final states was decreased due to quenching. In comparison, the fluorescence of the transient intermediate was decreased to a larger extent, indicating a higher accessibility of the fluorophore for the quencher and thus a more open tRNA intermediate (the scenario depicted in the right panel of Fig. 1B). Notably, at the highest KI concentration used, the transient fluorescence increase was no longer observed, indicating complete quenching and suggesting that the majority of the aa-tRNA assumes the distorted, more open state during the decoding of a cognate codon (see amplitudes in Table 1).TABLE 1Distortion of Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf) upon decoding of cognate and near-cognate codonsStateCognateNear-cognateKSVA0 − AKSVA0 − Am−1m−1No ribosomeaKSV in the absence of ribosomes was measured for the ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf) at steady-state conditions (25); the calculation of the transient differential amplitudes A0 − A is not applicable (n.a.).

Open table in a new tab The differential curves could be accurately evaluated with a two-exponential function, accounting for the distortion of the tRNA and the relaxation back into the undistorted conformation (Fig. 2B). The KSV values determined from the amplitudes of the distortion and relaxation steps (Fig. 2C) were in the range of 11–17 m−1, much higher than the value of 5 m−1 obtained for the tRNA free in solution or in the ternary complex with EF-Tu·GTP (Table 1). Given that all individual rate constants are known (5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 27Gromadski K.B. Daviter T. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the elemental step (Fig. 1A) can be identified at which tRNA changes the conformation (Fig. 2D). The formation of the distorted intermediate proceeds with the same rate as codon recognition, about 30 s−1 at the ligand concentrations used. The distorted intermediate accumulates through the early steps of decoding, i.e. codon recognition, GTPase activation, and GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 1A). The tRNA relaxation takes place at the same rate, about 10 s−1, as the steps following GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 1A), which in the following are collectively denoted as the “late steps” of decoding, in contrast to the “early steps” at which the distorted tRNA intermediate is formed. Thus, the tRNA is distorted upon codon recognition and remains in an open conformation through the pre- and post-hydrolysis steps (Fig. 1A) until it is released from EF-Tu. On the other hand, the difference in the degree of tRNA distortion at the early and late states (KSV values of 11 versus 17 m−1) may suggest that the structural details of the conformational rearrangement gradually change upon transition from the early to the late steps of decoding (Fig. 2C and Table 1). When analogous experiments were carried out with ribosome complexes exposing a near-cognate CUC codon, a fluorescence increase of Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf) was observed followed by a very slow decrease (Fig. 3A). Previous analysis suggested that most of the amplitude of the fluorescence increase is due to the formation of the codon-recognition complex (Ref. 5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar and below). Subsequent GTPase activation is impaired and GTP hydrolysis proceeds with a rate of about 0.1 s−1, which is rate-limiting for the following steps of accommodation and proofreading that are observed as a fluorescence decrease (Fig. 3A). Because of slow GTPase activation, the codon-recognition complex accumulates as a high-fluorescence intermediate, and the addition of KI predominantly decreases the fluorescence of that intermediate (Fig. 3B). As determined from the KI dependence of the differential amplitudes (Fig. 3C), the KSV values of the early and late steps are 14 m−1 (Table 1), which indicates the formation of an open tRNA intermediate also when the codon-anticodon complex contains a mismatch. Thus, upon reading a near-cognate codon, tRNA is distorted at the same step (upon codon recognition) and to an extent similar to that on a cognate codon. Kinetic modeling based on the known kinetic constants (5Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) suggests that 53% of the ribosome-bound tRNA is in the codon-recognition complex (Fig. 3D), which is in excellent agreement with the 56% fluorescence amplitude of the intermediate that is strongly quenched by KI (Table 1). From the distribution of the decoding intermediates, about 25% of aa-tRNA remains in the initial binding complex throughout the reaction (Fig. 3D), which may reduce the overall KSV value observed for an ensemble represented by a mixture of states. Therefore, the true value of KSV of either early or late steps is likely to be even higher than 14 m−1. This would suggest tha"

It still remains open to investigation whether postoperative fever has a bearing on prognosis in patients with lymph node negative breast cancers.We performed a retrospective study of 883 female unilateral patients with lymph node negative breast cancer. Fever was defined as an oral temperature ≥38 in one week postoperation. Survival curves were performed with Kaplan-Meier method, and annual relapse hazard was estimated by hazard function.The fever patients were older than those without fever (P<0.0001). Hypertensive patients had a propensity for fever after surgery (P = 0.011). A statistically significant difference was yielded in the incidence of fever among HR+/ERBB2-, ERBB2+, HR-/ERBB2- subgroups (P = 0.012). In the univariate survival analysis, we observed postoperative fever patients were more likely to recur than those without fever (P = 0.0027). The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that postoperative fever (P = 0.044, RR = 1.89, 95%CI 1.02-3.52) as well as the HR/ERBB2 subgroups (P = 0.013, HR = 1.60, 95%CI 1.09-2.31) was an independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival.Postoperative fever may contribute to relapse in node negative breast cancer patients, which suggests that changes in host milieu related to fever might accelerate the growth of micro-metastatic foci. It may be more precise to integrate both tumor- and host-related factors for the evaluation of relapse risk."
https://openalex.org/W2119545416,"Background Increasing attention is being paid to variations in the use of prescription drugs because their role in health care has grown to the point where their use can be considered a proxy for health system performance. Studies have shown that prescription drug use varies across regions in the US, UK, and Canada by more than would be predicted based on age and health status alone. In this paper, we explore the determinants of variations in the use of prescription drugs, drawing on health services theories of access to care. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using population-based administrative health care data for British Columbia (BC), Canada. We used logistic and hierarchical regressions to analyze the effects of individual- and area-level determinants of use of prescriptions overall and rates of purchase of prescriptions from five therapeutic categories representing a range of indications: antihypertensives, statins, acid reducing drugs, opioid drugs, and antidepressants. To indicate the relative scale of regional variations and the importance of individual- and area-level variables in explaining them, we computed standardized rates of utilization for 49 local health areas in BC. Results We found that characteristics of individuals and the areas in which they live affect likelihood of prescription drug purchase. Individual-level factors influenced prescription drug purchases in ways generally consistent with behavioral models of health services use. Contextual variables exerted influences that differed by type of drug studied. Population health, education levels, and ethnic composition of local areas were associated with significant differences in the likelihood of purchasing medications. Relatively modest regional variations remained after both individual-level and area-level determinants were taken into account. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that individual- and area-level factors should be considered when studying variations in the use of prescription drugs. Some sources of such variations, including individual- and area-level socioeconomic status, warrant further investigation and possible intervention to address inequities."

Physiol. 2005; 142: 432-437Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that apoa2 may perform functions during embryonic gastrulation. The previous data indicate that yolk lipids are taken up by the fish YSL, where they are assembled into lipoproteins for releasing into the perisyncytial space (13Poupard G. André M. Durliat M. Ballagny C. Boeuf G. Babin P.J. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 300: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein gene expression and lipoprotein secretion by teleost fish YSL indicate that this extraembryonic temporary structure could be the functional counterpart of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) of higher vertebrates. This investigation of the YSL provides information for understanding detailed AVE function. Embryonic gastrulation generates the three primary germ layers including ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm during vertebrate development. The morphogenetic movements of gastrulation have been well described (14Montero J.A. Heisenberg C.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 620-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the epiboly is the first morphogenetic movement of teleost gastrulation. Prior to epiboly, the zebrafish embryo undergoes meroblastic cleavage to generate a blastoderm cap on top of a single large yolk cell (15Kimmel C.B. Law R.D. Dev. Biol. 1985; 108: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The blastoderm consists of a superficial cell layer known as the enveloping layer (EVL), and a deep cell layer (DEL). Then, blastomeres at the boundary with the yolk cell collapse to release their nuclei into the yolk cell to form the YSL (15Kimmel C.B. Law R.D. Dev. Biol. 1985; 108: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Trinkaus J.P. J. Exp. Zool. 1993; 265: 258-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). YSL formation usually begins after the 512-cell stage and is completed by the end of the 1000 cell phase during zebrafish embryonic development (15Kimmel C.B. Law R.D. Dev.

External YSN (eYSN) form a marginal band of YSN located in front of the enveloping cell layer. During YSL organization, some of the eYSNs move toward the vegetal pole (epiboly movements), whereas others recede from the marginal zone and undergo convergence and extension (CE) movements (18D'Amico L.A.

By contrast, internal YSN (iYSN) are located below the blastoderm and EVL and primarily undergo CE movements (18D'Amico L.A. Cooper M.S. Dev.

In contrast, there is little data to show that nuclear division plays a role in YSN patterning to modulate gastrula movements during embryonic development. In the present study, we show that the zebrafish apoa2 gene expresses high levels in the ventral portion of YSL, regulates YSN division, modulates the spatial organization of nuclei in YSL and then regulates the embryonic patterning in zebrafish. Disruption of apoa2 induces severe defects in embryonic gastrulation. In addition, we also show that apoA-II is required for nuclear division in human HeLa cells. Our data present a novel finding that apoA-II plays an essential role in nuclear division in YSL for embryonic patterning in zebrafish and in human cells for proliferation. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were raised and maintained according to standard procedures (27Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). M. Westerfield, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Embryos were raised at 28.5 °C and staged as described (28Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). Zebrafish apoa2 (LOC: 570408) was searched for and identified from the NCBI core nucleotide program. We designed coding region primers for PCR cloning according to XM_693887 for apoa2 (sense-primer: CACTTTTTGTACACTTACTAACAAT and antisense-primer: AAATACATGGTTGAGGGAGT). The resultant PCR products were ligated into pGem-T easy vector, and cDNA sequences were confirmed. The relevant sequences were analyzed for multiple sequence alignments using DNAMAN6.0. Different percentages of amino acid identity were recorded after individual sequence comparisons. A phylogeny tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequences using DNAMAN6.0. apoa2 antisense RNA probe was synthesized from its cDNA with a digoxygenin RNA labeling kit (Roche) corresponding to the entire coding sequence region (426 bp) of the apoa2 gene, using SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). Whole-mount in situ hybridization was carried out as previously described (29Thisse C. Thisse B. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). In brief, embryos were permeabilized with proteinase K (10 μg/ml, Promega) and hybridized overnight at 65 °C with the DIG-labeled antisense probes. After several washes at high stringent temperature, NBT/BCIP (Roche) staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Injection into the yolk of zebrafish embryos was performed at the 1-cell or 1k-cell stage. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were purchased from Gene Tools (Philomath). These MOs were designed complementary to the 5′ sequence near the translational initiation site of apoa2 (apoa2 MOs) with the sequences: apoa2 MO1, 5′- GAATGAGAGCGAATGTCAGCTTCAT-3′ (targets 5′ sequence spanning the start codon); and apoa2 MO2, 5′-TGTTAGTAAGTGTACAAAAAGTGAG-3′ (directed against the sequence 5′ of the UTR to the start codon). Sequences were as follows: standard control MO, 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. Capped apoa2 mRNA was synthesized from its cDNA subcloned in the pcDNA3.1(+) vector using mMACHINE T7 Ultra Kit (Ambion). SYTOX Green, which acts to specifically label nuclei, was injected into yolk at 1k-cell stage, at 50 μm, as described (21Wilkins S.J. Yoong S. Verkade H. Mizoguchi T. Plowman S.J. Hancock J.F. Kikuchi Y. Heath J.K. Perkins A.C. Dev. Biol. 2008; 314: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Zebrafish embryos were collected and fixed overnight in 4% PFA (in PBS), washed twice in PBS and once in ultrapure water for 5 min, permeabilized in acetone at −20 °C for 7 min, and then washed once in ultrapure water and twice in PBS for 5 min. The embryos were treated with 3% BSA in PBS for 30 min and then soaked in anti F-actin antibody or anti α-tubulin antibody (Millipore) overnight at 4 °C. The embryos were washed for 2 h with frequent changes of PBS and treated with secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:800 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) for 1 h. Embryos were rinsed twice in PBS for 5 min and stained with DAPI (1:5000; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). HeLa cell staining: The cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% PFA (in PBS), washed three times with PBS for 5 min, incubated with 3% BSA and 0.5% Triton in PBS for 20 min, and washed once in PBS for 5 min. The cells were incubated with anti-H3pS10 antibody (Millipore cat. 06-570), α-tubulin (Millipore cat.04-1117) antibody diluted 1:1000, or γ-tubulin antibody diluted 1:5000 (Sigma T6557) in 3% BSA in PBST for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in PBST with 3% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times with PBS. Total RNAs of 100 embryos at different stages, including 4-cell, sphere, 30% epiboly, shield, tail-bud, and 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) were isolated. The total volume for each reaction was 20 μl using the PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa DRR014A). All resultant cDNAs were used as templates for PCR with ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). One pair of primers (apoa2 sense: CTTGCACTCCAAGTGTCAGTG, apoa2 antisense: TGAAAATACATGGTTGAGGGA) were synthesized (Invitrogen) used to express levels during embryogenesis. As a positive control for RT-PCR analysis, actin primers (β-actin sense: TGTGGCCCTGGACTTCGAGCAG and β-actin antisense: TAGAAGCACTTCCTGTGGACGA) were designed to amplify a 474-bp fragment (GenBankTM accession number BC045846.1). A series of PCR reactions were performed with β-actin primers to determine the template concentration and to provide a quantitative internal control for PCR reaction efficiency under the same reaction conditions as apoa2. Six mutants of zebrafish apoa2 were designed on the basis of conserved domain analysis and generated by PCR. The C-terminal deletion mutants included MC77, MC46, and MC36, which were missing 64, 95, and 105 amino acids, respectively. The N-terminal deletion mutants comprised MN20, MN47, and MN79, which were missing 19, 46, and 78 amino acids, respectively. Capped apoa2 mutant mRNA was synthesized as described above. Embryos were injected and imaged at bud stage for analysis of convergence and extension as described (30Weiser D.C. Row R.H. Kimelman D. Development. 2009; 136: 2375-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The density of the plasma was adjusted to 1.3 g/ml with KBr, and normal saline (density is 1.006 g/ml) was layered over the adjusted plasma to form a discontinuous NaCl/KBr density gradient. The tubes loaded with sample and gradient were placed in a P40ST rotor of Toshiba ultracentrifuge (model: CP70MX). The tubes were centrifuged at 350,000 rpm for 3.5 h at 10 °C. The HDL layer was collected. The purity was evaluated by Western blotting using anti-apoAI polyclonal antibody (DiaSorin), and the quantity was measured by nephelometer-Dimension XPand (Dade Behring, Germany). 1 mg of protein of HDL was delipidated and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band of apoAII was cut and electroeluted for 5 h in a dialysis bag. The protein in the dialysis bag was re-dialyzed in PBS buffer. The dialyzed apoAII was lyophilized and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 m guanidinium chloride, and then dialyzed in PBS before use. HeLa cells were treated with colchicine (Sigma) at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells in suspension were centrifuged for 8 min at 800 × g, and the supernatant was removed. The prewarmed hypotonic solution was added. The cell pellet was resuspended by pipetting up and down with a Pasteur pipette and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. 10 to 15 drops of methacarn (∼0.5 ml) were added to the cell suspension from a Pasteur pipette and mixed. The cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was aspirated. Methacarn was added, and the cells were resuspended with a pipette and left for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was aspirated. 1% paraformaldehyde was added to cell pellets to form a somewhat cloudy suspension. 15–20 μl of the fixed cells were dropped onto slides from a height of ∼37.5 cm and allowed to air dry. The slides were washed 5 min in PBS and stained with DAPI. Zebrafish embryos were harvested at the sphere stage and were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, washed one time in PBS for 5 min, then incubated in acetone at −20 °C for 5 min and washed three times in PBS for 5 min each wash. 100 μg/ml RNase I were added to the zebrafish embryos, incubated 1 h at 37 °C, and washed two times in PBS for 5 min each. The embryos were incubated in protease K (0.1 μg/ml) for 1 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS for 5 min each. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed three times in PBS for 5 min each. Embryos were passed through a dehydrating series of 70, 80, and 100% ethanol for 5 min each. Embryos were denatured for 10 min in 70% formamide/2× SSC (pH 7.0), 72 °C. Embryos were passed through a dehydrating series of 70, 80, and 100% ethanol for 5 min each. The Cy3-labeled (GGGTTA)7 oligomer probe (Invitrogen) was added to the pretreated embryos and hybridized for at least 16 h at 37 °C. The embryos were washed three times in 30% formamide in 2× SSC, then five changes of 2× SSC, all at 45 °C, and then counterstained with DAPI. HeLa cells were plated onto chamber slides in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS in BD FalconTM 24-well Multiwell Plate. When cell confluency reached ∼30%, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and the plates were returned to the 37 °C incubator. After 2 days, the serum-free medium was removed, and fresh DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, HDL, apoA-II, or lipids from HDL was added. The cells were allowed to grow for 6 h. Cellular proliferation activity was visualized by anti-Histone H3 pS10 antibody staining. To address apoA-II function in embryonic development, we cloned apoa2 cDNA from zebrafish embryos and found that apoa2 was highly conserved with other fish (data not shown). To analyze the spatiotemporal expression of apoa2 in detail during embryonic development, in situ, hybridization was performed from the 4-cell stage to 48 hpf embryos using an antisense RNA probe (Fig. 1, A–K). Apoa2 mRNA of maternal origin was detected at the 4-cell stage (Fig. 1A), and apoa2 zygotic transcripts mainly accumulated in YSL (Fig. 1, C–E). During epiboly, the apoa2 transcripts were present in the ventral side (Fig. 1, D and F). The expression pattern of apoa2 is similar to apoa1 and apoE, which is associated with lipoprotein synthesis and secretion (9Zhou L. Wang Y. Yao B. Li C.J. Ji G.D. Gui J.F. Comparative Biochem. Physiol. 2005; 142: 432-437Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). During the hatching period, apoa2 exclusively showed high levels in YSL (Fig. 1, J and K). RT-PCR confirmed the temporal expression pattern of apoa2 (Fig. 1L) in zebrafish embryos. Apoa2 mRNA was maternal loaded and showed increased levels with the progression of embryonic development after the shield stage, suggesting that zygotic transcription of apoa2 is initiated at shield stage. To examine the function of apoa2 during zebrafish development, we used two different antisense morpholino oligonucleotides complementary to the translational initiation site of zebrafish apoa2 mRNA, apoa2 MO1 and apoa2 MO2, to knockdown its function in zebrafish embryos. The morpholino oligonucleotides efficiently blocked the expression of zebrafish apoa2-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused protein in zebrafish embryos (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting they were able to inhibit the production of endogenous apoA-II protein in zebrafish embryos. Injection of control MO (ctl MO), apoa2 MO1, MO2, or co-injection with MO1 and MO2 into embryos at the 1-cell stage was performed. Through real-time observation, we found that embryos injected with apoa2 MO1 or apoa2 MO2 at the 1-cell stage showed similar developmental defects at the gastrulation stage. Embryos injected with apoa2 MO appeared similar to uninjected embryos or embryos injected with a standard ctl MO until the 30% epiboly stage (4.6 hpf). After that stage, the blastoderm and blastoderm margin in the majority of apoa2 MO-injected embryos became irregular compared with control embryos (Fig. 2, A–D). In almost half of the defective embryos, it was difficult to identify the formation of the shield, and thus, the dorsal-ventral orientation of the embryo. The embryos failed to progress through epiboly and were lethal because of the great contractile force of the blastoderm margin (Fig. 2, A, C, and D). In many of the apoa2 MO-treated embryos, the aforesaid defects did not induce death of embryos, and such defects were defined as the “survival” phenotype. The survival embryos injected with apoa2 MOs were able to develop further and displayed embryonic defects. Many embryos were mildly defective, underwent epiboly, and showed a longer animal-vegetal (AV) axis than control (Fig. 2H). The rest of the embryos were severely defective, did not completely cover the yolk cell by the end of the gastrula period, and showed a mildly longer AV axis (Fig. 2I). We were able to reliably rescue apoa2 morphants by co-injection of capped mRNA of zebrafish apoa2 that did not contain the MO binding sites or purified native human HDL (purity>95%, contains 0.8 mg/ml apoA-II) (Fig. 2, E and F). Most rescued embryos survived to 24 hpf, and only a small fraction of embryos underwent yolk lysis. However, some rescued embryos demonstrated various developmental abnormalities (data not shown). Injection of apoa2-capped RNA or HDL alone resulted in identical abnormalities, suggesting these are the result of ectopic apoa2 overexpression rather than partial rescue. Taken together, these results demonstrate that apoa2 MOs can specifically hinder the activity of endogenous apoa2 resulting in specific phenotypes. Apoa2 is specifically expressed in the YSL. We tested whether knockdown of apoa2 exclusively in the YSL was sufficient to result in epiboly failure by co-injecting apoa2 or ctl MO with rhodamine dextran (RD) into the yolk cell at the 1k-cell stage. Embryos whose blastoderm did not contain RD were scored for phenotype analysis. Epiboly defects were consistently observed in embryos in which RD was restricted to the yolk (Fig. 2, D and J), and less than 50% of such embryos survived to 24 hpf. Thus, loss of apoa2 within the yolk cell is sufficient to block epiboly. These results suggest that the normal expression of apoa2 in YSL is required for embryonic development. Most of the survival embryos with the knockdown of apoa2 function could epiboly, but the movement was delayed or failed to cover the yolk cell at the end of gastrulation; thus we were concerned about whether there were defects in cell movement during embryonic morphogenesis. We used a Kaede-mediated photoconversion strategy to test the ability of anterior migration of axial cells and dorsal convergence of lateral cells, respectively. Dorsal migration of lateral cells in apoa2 MO1-injected embryos was reduced (Fig. 3, C–D′ and E), and anterior movement of axial cells showed no significant difference compared with ctrl MO embryos (Fig. 3, A–B′). Then the embryos which displayed “mild” phenotype as described (Fig. 2H) were examined by the expression of marker genes in embryos with knockdown apoa2 by whole-mount in situ hybridization (supplemental Fig. S2, A–N). apoa2 MO embryos exhibited longer notochord marked with no tail (ntl), slightly wider neural plate marked with distal-less homeobox gene 3 (dlx3), and normal position of prechordal plate assessed by hatching gland 1 (hgg1), in comparison to control embryos (supplemental Fig. S2, A–F). Alteration of the expression pattern of dlx3 revealed that inhibition of apoa2 expression induced reduction for convergence of neuroectoderm. Myogenic differentiation 1 (myoD) and paraxial protocadherin (papc) expression in paraxial and lateral mesoderm appeared to be mediolaterally expanded in the embryos lacking apoa2 (supplemental Fig. S2, G–J). The altered expression of forkhead box D3 (foxD3) indicated that convergence of neural crest was interfered in embryos with loss of apoa2 (supplemental Fig. S2, K and L). The paraxial distribution of SRY-box containing gene 17 (sox17) labeling progenitors of endoderm cells were disturbed with injection to apoa2 MO1 embryos (supplemental Fig. S2N) compared with control embryos (supplemental Fig. S2M), suggesting that the normal movement of endodermal cells was impaired with knockdown of apoa2. Together, the results indicate that apoa2 affected cell convergence movement during the gastrula period. Convergence and extension are key steps for dorsoventral (DV) patterning during embryonic gastrulation (21Wilkins S.J. Yoong S. Verkade H. Mizoguchi T. Plowman S.J. Hancock J.F. Kikuchi Y. Heath J.K. Perkins A.C. Dev. Biol. 2008; 314: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether apoa2 also functioned in DV patterning, we examined the expression of a variety of DV marker genes in embryos, which were injected with apoa2 MO1 at the 1-cell stage and exhibited the “survival” phenotype (Fig. 2B), by whole-mount in situ hybridization (supplemental Fig. S2, O–V). In apoa2 MO embryos, the expression of floating head (flh) and goosecoid (gsc) displayed no significant changes (supplemental Fig. S2, O–R). The expression of GATA-binding protein 2 (gata2) and even-skipped-like 1 (eve1) was also not visibly altered (supplemental Fig. S2, S–V). These results show that impairment of endogenous apoa2 mRNA activity does not apparently affect the dorsoventral differentiation. The proper organization of YSL has been shown to be essential for initiation and progression of epiboly in teleosts (21Wilkins S.J. Yoong S. Verkade H. Mizoguchi T. Plowman S.J. Hancock J.F.

Therefore, the expression of the YSL-specific gene mtx2 (21Wilkins S.J. Yoong"

Although large aggregates of proteinase K-resistant PrP (PrPres) are infectious, the precise relationships between aggregation state and infectivity remain to be established. In this study, we have fractionated detergent lysates from prion-infected cultured cells by differential ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration and have characterized a previously unnoticed PrP species. This abnormal form is resistant to proteinase K digestion but, in contrast to typical aggregated PrPres, remains in the soluble fraction at intermediate centrifugal forces and is not retained by filters of 300-kDa cutoff. Cell-based assay and inoculation to animals demonstrate that these entities are infectious. The finding that cell-derived small infectious PrPres aggregates can be recovered in the absence of strong in vitro denaturating treatments now gives a biological basis for investigating the role of small PrP aggregates in the pathogenicity and/or the multiplication cycle of prions.

Prion diseases are caused by the misfolding of the endogenously expressed PrP protein, and the most widely accepted model of prion multiplication is that abnormally folded PrP recruits and converts the host PrP into new abnormal forms (1Prusiner S.B.

Historically, abnormal PrP was operationally defined as insoluble and resistant to protease digestion (4Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B.

Although normal PrP protein is soluble in detergents and sensitive to proteinase K (PK) digestion, part of PrP in infected tissues is PK-resistant and recovered in the pellets of centrifuged samples. These large PrPres aggregates are infectious (5Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12277-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether infectivity is entirely congruent with these species (6Aguzzi A. Sigurdson C.

Here, we investigated the diversity of infectious abnormal PrP species in a cell line and in neuronal primary cultures infected with a sheep scrapie agent. Although we obtained no evidence for the presence of PK-sensitive infectivity, we identified a previously unnoticed abnormal PrP species. Solubility and ultrafiltration assays indicate that these PK-resistant PrP entities are small aggregates. These species are infectious and may explain the perplexing presence of infectivity in brain samples devoid of detectable large aggregates of PrPres. Rov cells (the Rov9 clone) were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (17Vilette D.

To induce the expression of ovine PrP, 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the culture medium. Primary neuronal cultures were established from transgenic mice expressing the ovine PrP (tg338) or the human PrP on a mouse PrP0/0 background, as described (18Cronier S. Laude H. Peyrin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12271-12276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were extracted from 5- to 7-day-old mice by enzymatic and mechanical dissociation and were plated at a density of 2,500 cells/mm2 in plastic culture wells coated with 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in DMEM-GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, penicillin and streptomycin, N2 and B27 supplements (Invitrogen). The medium was complemented weekly with 1 mg/ml glucose and 10 μm antimitotics uridine and fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunofluorescence analysis, CGNs were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and analyzed 13–20 days later. Cultures were prefixed by adding 1 volume of paraformaldehyde (4% w/v in PBS) to the culture medium. Ten minutes later, the cells were subjected to a second round of fixation by adding 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and stained for microtubule-associated protein 2 with mAb HM-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and for β-tubulin III with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Bound antibodies were visualized with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probe), and coverslips were mounted on slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) containing DAPI. Ovine transgenic mice (tg338 line) are transgenic for the ovine PrP on a mouse PrP0/0 background (19Le Dur A. Béringue V. Andréoletti O. Reine F. Laï T.L. Baron T. Bratberg B. Vilotte J.L.

At the terminal stage, brains were homogenized at 10% (w/v) in 5% sterile glucose using a high speed homogenizer (TeSeE Precess 48 system), and infectious inoculum was heated at 70 °C for 20 min. Persistently infected Rov cultures were obtained by exposing uninfected cells to 0.5% infectious brain homogenate for a few days. The resulting cultures were grown for 1–2 months and used to prepare cell lysates. Mock-infected Rov cultures were grown and processed in parallel. CGNs (at day 3 after plating) were infected by diluting the 10% infectious homogenate 1,000-fold in cell culture medium. Cell cultures were rinsed with cold PBS and solubilized for 10 min at 4 °C in Triton-DOC lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation (425 × g, 1 min), and cellular proteins in the postnuclear supernatants were quantified by bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Digestion with PK (recombinant grade; Roche Applied Science) was performed for 2 h at 37 °C with a mass ratio of 4 μg of PK/mg of cellular proteins, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of Pefabloc (Sigma-Aldrich) to 4 mm. Small volumes of 10% brain homogenates were solubilized in Triton-DOC lysis buffer and processed as cell lysates for detection of PrPres. PK-digested samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 10,000–20,000 × g, and pellets were analyzed by Western blotting. Lysates (the equivalent of 250 μg of proteins) from infected Rov cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 μg of PK, and digestion was stopped with Pefabloc. Mock-treated lysates were incubated with Pefabloc and no PK. Proteins were precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol, resuspended in PBS, and used to inoculate Rov cells. Preparative isolation of the soluble and insoluble fractions was carried out with three different infected Rov cultures with similar results. Typically, 35 ml of PK-digested cell lysates (1 mg/ml) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (gav) for 1 h at 4 °C in polyallomer tubes in a SW32 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was removed, and 4 volumes of methanol were added to precipitate proteins. The insoluble pellet was dried at room temperature, transferred with 400 μl of PBS into a microtube, and stored at −20 °C. The methanol-precipitated supernatant fraction was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g in 50-ml tubes, and pelleted material was air-died and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS and transferred into a microtube. Pellets from both fractions were sonicated for a total of 6 min at power 9 with a Cup-Horn apparatus to help dissolution and stored at −20 °C until used for immunoblotting, guanidine denaturation assays, cell-based assay, and bioassay in mice. In some experiments, the supernatant obtained after a 1-h centrifugation at 100,000 × g was transferred to a new clean tube and subjected to a second centrifugation at 100,000 × g. In some experiments, analytical PK-digested samples were centrifuged in 1.5-ml microtubes either in a TLA-110 rotor (Beckman) or in a microcentrifuge. Rotors with different sedimentation pathlengths have distinct efficiencies to pellet a given particle, and these can be compared using their k factors. At 100,000 × g, k factors of SW32 and TLA-110 rotors are 262 and 50, respectively, indicating that the TLA-110 is about 5-fold more efficient than SW32 to pellet a given particle. Therefore, centrifugation at 20,000 × g or 100,000 × g with TLA-110 corresponds to 100,000 × g or 500,000 × g, respectively, with the SW32 rotor. Pellets and methanol-precipitated supernatants were resuspended in small volumes of PBS without sonication and analyzed by immunoblotting and in the cell-based assay. Insoluble and soluble fractions in PBS were mixed with a noninfected cell lysate to achieve a final protein concentration of 870 μg/ml. Aliquots (30 μl) were mixed with the same volume of H2O or GdnHCl to achieve GdnHCl final concentrations of 1, 1.5, and 2 m and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After methanol precipitation, the samples were digested with 0.1 μg of PK for 2 h at 37 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE before transfer to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). The Western blots were stained for PrP with Sha31 mAb (21Féraudet C. Morel N. Simon S. Volland H. Frobert Y. Créminon C. Vilette D. Lehmann S. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11247-11258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Filters were developed using an ECL Plus reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare) and visualized with a Bio-Rad VersaDoc imaging system. The signals were quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The total and the soluble fractions of PK-digested infected Rov cell lysates were ultrafiltrated as follows. We used filters with cutoffs of 0.2 μm, 1,000 kDa, 300 kDa (Vivaspin 500; Sartorius), and 100-kDa (Microcon; Millipore). Before use, the filters were rinsed with the lysis buffer to remove the preservatives. For each filter, 350 μg of PK-digested lysates (1 mg/ml) were loaded. The ultrafiltration was performed at 5,000 rpm, at room temperature for 15 min in a microcentrifuge. The volumes of the collected filtrates were the same as the loaded volumes. The retentates were recovered by the addition of 350 μl of the lysis buffer. The filtrates and retentates were either methanol-precipitated or subjected to centrifugation (10,000 × g, 1 h) to generate soluble and insoluble fractions. Purified βS36 antibody (22Morel N. Simon S. Frobert Y. Volland H. Mourton-Gilles C. Negro A. Sorgato M.C. Créminon C. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30143-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and BSA were coupled to Dynabeads M-270 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Lysate from infected Rov cells (1 mg/ml) was PK-digested and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g in the SW32 rotor. Supernatant (1.1 ml) was incubated with 5.5 mg of βS36- or BSA-coupled Dynabeads for 2 h, at room temperature. A fraction of the supernatant (100 μl) and the equivalent amount of magnetic beads were analyzed by Western blotting. The remainder (1 ml) was methanol-precipitated, resuspended with sonication in 300 μl of PBS, and used in the cell-based assay. Uninfected Rov cells were seeded in 6-well plates in the presence of doxycycline. When confluent, the cultures were exposed to 3 ml of culture medium containing 2, 8, or 32 μl of the insoluble or soluble preparative fractions. In parallel, 32 μl of each fraction was used to inoculate Rov cells in the absence of doxycycline. For cell-based assay of immunodepleted supernatants, from 30 to 300 μl were tested. Infection was allowed to proceed for 3–4 weeks at the end of which the cultures were solubilized. In each assay, 3 ml of culture medium containing serial 10-fold dilutions of the PG127 10% infectious brain homogenate was inoculated in parallel to Rov cells. Cell lysates (500 μg of proteins) were PK-digested and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h, and pellets were analyzed for insoluble PrPres by Western blotting. Insoluble and soluble preparative fractions (4 μl each, corresponding to 350 μg of cellular proteins digested with PK) were diluted to 200 μl with 10% brain homogenate from a healthy sheep, and 20 μl was inoculated intracerebrally into six tg338 mice. Mice were then clinically monitored until the occurrence of scrapie clinical signs, at which time they were euthanized. The sheep prion agent used here was selected because it multiplies stably, efficiently, and apparently faithfully in previously described Rov and MovS cell lines (23Vilette D. Vet. Res. 2008; 39: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and in cultured primary neurons (18Cronier S. Laude H. Peyrin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12271-12276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, infectivity levels can be quantified either through bioassay in tg338 transgenic mice expressing the ovine PrP protein (20Vilotte J.L. Soulier S. Essalmani R. Stinnakre M.G. Vaiman D. Lepourry L. Da Silva J.C. Besnard N. Dawson M. Buschmann A. Groschup M. Petit S. Madelaine M.F. Rakatobe S. Le Dur A. Vilette D. Laude H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5977-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or through a cell-based assay. Previous studies reported the presence of abnormal, yet PK-sensitive, forms of PrP in infected tissues and cultured cells from various species (11Pastrana M.A. Sajnani G. Onisko B. Castilla J. Morales R. Soto C. Requena J.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15710-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat.

J. 2007; 401: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Tzaban S. Friedlander G. Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Yedidia Y. Shaked G. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12868-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these particular abnormal PrPs are infectious. To clarify this issue in our model, chronically infected Rov cultures were solubilized in nondenaturing detergents. Cell lysates were subjected to PK digestion (2 h at 37 °C, with 4 μg of PK/mg of cellular proteins) or left untreated, and the samples were precipitated with methanol. Infectivity in the resuspended materials was quantified through a Rov cell-based assay. In this assay, Rov cultures inoculated with increasing infectivity accumulate dose-dependent amounts of PrPres (Fig. 1A). Uninfected Rov cells were exposed to mock- and PK-digested infected Rov extracts, and the inoculated cultures were analyzed 3 weeks later for the presence of PrPres. We found that Rov cells inoculated with mock- or PK-digested samples had accumulated similar amounts of PrPres, indicating that infectivity in the two inocula was similar (PrPres amounts in cultures inoculated with mock-treated lysates was 19.5% ± 22% (mean ± S.E., n = 6) above those in cultures inoculated with PK-treated lysates; see a representative Western blot analysis in Fig. 1B). We thus concluded that the vast majority of infectivity propagated in Rov cells is resistant to PK digestion and that PK-sensitive infectivity, if any, is marginal. Fig. 1C illustrates the PrPres species recovered in nondenaturing detergent lysates of chronically infected Rov cells. Immunoblot analysis of methanol-precipitated, PK-digested samples reveals the presence of PrPres in lysates from infected cultures (lane 5). We reasoned that small PrPres aggregates, if present, might remain in the supernatant after centrifugation of PK-digested lysates. PK-digested lysates were subjected to a standard centrifugation step (e.g. 10,000–20,000 × g for 1 h in a microcentrifuge). Western blot analysis of pellets revealed the presence of PrPres (lane 1), consistent with the known insolubility of large PrPres aggregates. Strikingly, a PrPres signal was consistently observed when material from methanol-precipitated supernatant was analyzed (lane 3). No PrPres was observed in either fraction when uninfected cultures were analyzed (lanes 2, 4, and 6). To characterize the PrPres species in the supernatant and pellet fractions, large volumes of infected cell lysates were digested with PK and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a SW32 rotor to generate soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) fractions. Soluble material was recovered by methanol precipitation and resuspended in PBS by sonication along with the original insoluble pellet. Immunoblot analysis of the supernatant and pellet fractions showed that PrPres was still present in 100,000 × g supernatants (Fig. 1D). Importantly, this PrPres species quantitatively remained in the soluble fraction when the supernatant was submitted to a second 100,000 × g centrifugation step (Fig. 1E). Quantification through Western blot analysis of various amounts of the two fractions indicated that PrPres in the supernatant represents 12% ± 8% of total PrPres (mean ± S.D., four determinations from three different infected cultures). To test for the presence of infectivity in the soluble fraction, we first used the Rov cell-based assay. Uninfected Rov cells were exposed to increasing equivalent amounts of the soluble and insoluble fractions and analyzed 3 weeks later for the presence of PrPres. Although no PrPres was observed in control cells not expressing ovine PrP, the dose-dependent presence of PrPres in Rov cells challenged with the 100,000 × g supernatant demonstrated that the supernatant was infectious (Fig. 2A). After quantification of PrPres levels in the cultures exposed to the different amounts of the soluble and insoluble fractions, we estimated that 18.5% ± 5% of infectivity was soluble (mean ± S.D., four determinations from three experiments). To investigate the physical support for infectivity, we sought to deplete PrPres from the infectious supernatants by immunoprecipitation with βS36, a monoclonal antibody that specifically immunoprecipitates PrPres aggregates (22Morel N. Simon S. Frobert Y. Volland H. Mourton-Gilles C. Negro A. Sorgato M.C. Créminon C. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30143-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). βS36- but not BSA-coupled magnetic beads removed most (85%, n = 2) of the PrPres in the 100,000 × g supernatants (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, ∼90% (n = 2) of infectivity was also removed from the immunodepleted supernatants, as assessed by Rov cell-based assay (Fig. 2C). Soluble and insoluble fractions were also inoculated into tg338 transgenic mice highly susceptible to the ovine prion strain used in this study (19Le Dur A. Béringue V. Andréoletti O. Reine F. Laï T.L. Baron T. Bratberg B. Vilotte J.L. Sarradin P. Benestad S.L. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16031-16036Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). All of the inoculated mice died with typical neurological symptoms and accumulated abnormal PrP in their brains (data not shown). Mice inoculated with the pellet and supernatant fractions died 74 days ± 4 days (n = 5) and 73 days ± 4 days (n = 4) after inoculation, respectively. Mice inoculated with fractions from uninfected cultures remained clinically healthy and were killed at 110 days. These similar incubation periods correspond to infectious titers within the same order of magnitude and confirm that the 100,000 × g supernatants are infectious. Altogether, our data show that PK-resistant PrP recovered in a detergent-soluble fraction is infectious. We then asked whether PrPres in the soluble fraction could be a by-product generated during PK digestion of insoluble PrPres. To explore this possibility, analytical volumes (<1 ml) of lysates were centrifuged before PK digestion. The soluble fractions were then PK-digested and analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 3A shows that the PrPres species can also be detected in the supernatants of non-PK-digested cell lysates, indicating that PK digestion is not required to generate this PrPres species. To examine whether PrPres species in the soluble and insoluble fractions differ in their PK resistance, cell lysates from infected cells were digested with increasing amounts of PK before isolation of the soluble and insoluble fractions. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3B) revealed that PrPres in the supernatant is as PK-resistant as insoluble PrPres. To study the structural stability of PrPres in the soluble and insoluble fractions, we performed guanidine denaturation assays. Both fractions were incubated with increasing amounts of GdnHCl and then digested with PK. Immunoblot analysis indicated that PrPres species in the soluble and insoluble fractions have similar stabilities to denaturation by GdnHCl (Fig. 3C). The ovine prion agent used here can also be propagated in tg338-derived neuronal primary cultures (18Cronier S. Laude H. Peyrin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12271-12276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cultured CGNs from either tg338 (CGNov) (Fig. 4A) or transgenic mice expressing a heterologous PrP (human PrP, CGNhu, used as nonpermissive, negative controls) were infected 3 days after plating. The cells were solubilized and analyzed 7, 14, or 21 days after infection. A marked, time-dependent accumulation of PrPres was observed in CGNov, demonstrating active prion multiplication in the primary neuronal cultures derived from tg338 mice (Fig. 4B). Analysis of supernatant and pellet fractions from PK-digested CGNov lysates revealed that 12.5% ± 4% of the total PrPres was in the soluble fraction (mean ± S.D. of five determinations from two different infected CGNov cultures) (Fig. 4C). Lastly, brain homogenates from tg338 mice, either healthy or at the terminal stage, were solubilized in the Triton-DOC lysis buffer, subjected to PK digestion, and centrifuged. Analysis of the supernatant and pellet fractions showed that PrPres was also present in the soluble fraction of infected brain tissue (Fig. 4D). As a first step to investigate the reasons for apparent solubility of PrPres (small size or low density), we tested whether PrPres in the soluble fraction would be pelleted if centrifuged at a higher speed. To apply higher centrifugation forces, we used a TLA-110 rotor (Beckmann). Because its k factor is about 5-fold less than that of SW32, TLA-110 is about 5-fold more efficient to pellet a given particle (see “Experimental Procedures”), e.g. 20,000 × g supernatants in the TLA-110 are equivalent to 100,000 × g supernatants in SW32. Although normal PrP from uninfected cells remained in the supernatants (Fig. 5A, right panel), data in Fig. 5A, left panel, show that the vast majority (∼95%, n = 2) of the PrPres in the soluble fraction is pelleted when g force was increased to 100,000 × g in the TLA-110 rotor (equivalent to 500,000 × g with SW32). We also performed ultracentrifugation of the soluble fraction through a 10% sucrose cushion. As expected for small aggregates, PrPres did not float in the sucrose and were found in the pellet (Fig. 5B). Cell-based assays showed that infectivity in the 100,000 × g supernatants (Sup100K) was 10-fold lower to that in Sup20K (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that infectious PrPres species in the SW32 100,000 × g supernatants are not fully soluble. We then subjected PK-digested cell lysates to ultrafiltration, a convenient alternative to sucrose gradient for separating large PrPres aggregates from other filterable molecules (24Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.M. Yang S.L. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Riesner D. Kellings K. Post K. Wille H. Serban H. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PrPres species in the retained (retentates) and nonretained (filtrates) fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Data in Fig. 6A show that although most of PrPres was retained, approximately 10% of total PrPres passed through 300-kDa but not through 100-kDa filters. Before ultrafiltration, insoluble PrPres is the major (∼90%, Fig. 1) PK-resistant species. This was dramatically different in the filtrates from 1,000-kDa and 300-kDa membranes (Fig. 6B), indicating that PrPres in the soluble fraction passed much more readily through these filters than did insoluble PrPres. To confirm that the former quantitatively crosses filters of low molecular mass cutoff, PrPres from the soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation and then submitted to ultrafiltration through a range of different filters. As expected, PrPres was not retained by 1,000- and 300-kDa filters as it was exclusively detected in the corresponding filtrates (Fig. 6C). In contrast, 100-kDa pore size fully retained PrPres. The above data indicate that the infectious PrPres recovered in the detergent-soluble fraction are small aggregates. After longstanding controversies, there is now a wide agreement that prion infectivity is associated with abnormally folded PrP. Historically, abnormal PrP has been operationally defined as PK-resistant and insoluble (26Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4096) Google Scholar), and a wealth of studies indicates that fractions containing large insoluble PrPres aggregates are infectious. However, it does not imply that infectivity is exclusively associated with large aggregates of PrPres or that they are the more efficient species to promote infection. A number of studies reported successful disaggregation of at least part of prion infectivity by chemical and/or physical treatments. Early experiments showed that sonication of large PrPres aggregates (known as prion rods) in detergent and phospholipids can solubilize PrPres and infectivity (27Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Denaturation by chaotropic salts and subsequent renaturation also led to infectivity recovery in low density fractions after sucrose gradients (28Manousis T. Verghese-Nikolakaki S. Keyes P. Sachsamanoglou M. Dawson M. Papadopoulos O. Sklaviadis T.K. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and disruption of prion rods by sonication in detergents liberated infectivity in 100,000 × g supernatants (25Riesner D. Kellings K. Post K. Wille H. Serban H. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, small PrP aggregates, isolated after physical disruption of detergent-extracted aggregates of PrPres, were shown to be more infectious than large ones (29Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A.G. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Nature. 2005; 437: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), presumably by providing an increased number of multiplication-competent seeds. Although this study added strong support for small PrP aggregates as more active species to initiate infection, firm evidence for the presence of small PrPres aggregates in infected tissues or cells was lacking. Thus, the biological significance of the aforementioned experimental treatments remained an open question. An important outcome of our study is to show that small infectious PrPres aggregates can be recovered from infected cells after a standard nondenaturing solubilization step in the absence of further treatments. Importantly, these small infectious PrPres aggregates were also observed in the absence of PK digestion, indicating that they were not derived from PK proteolysis of the large aggregates. They were conveniently separated from large PrPres aggregates by a solubility assay and/or by ultrafiltration through low molecular weight cutoff filters. Two lines of evidence indicate that the PrPres species in the detergent-soluble 100,000 × g supernatants are small PrP aggregates. First, and in contrast to normal PrP, these small PrPres species are eventually pelleted after ultracentrifugation at higher centrifugal forces. Second, they are immunoprecipitated by βS36, a mAb directed against aggregated PrP from infected tissue and not recognizing normal PrP (22Morel N. Simon S. Frobert Y. Volland H. Mourton-Gilles C. Negro A. Sorgato M.C. Créminon C. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30143-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, further purification will be required to determine their molecular composition. The population of small PrPres aggregates, which represents roughly 10% of the total PrPres in infected Rov cells, is also observed in infected primary cultures of neurons and in brain tissue of infected mice, suggesting that it is produced by a wide variety of infected cells. An important issue is whether these small PrPres aggregates are more infectious than the large ones, as shown for small aggregates generated in vitro (29Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A.G. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Nature. 2005; 437: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Studies are now ongoing to address precisely this question. Another interesting point will be to determine whether the formation of small and large PrPres aggregates is due to different metabolic pathways. Alternatively, small aggregates could be metabolic intermediates in the formation of larger deposits. They could also be a cell-mediated catabolic product of large aggregates, contributing to an efficient transmission of infection during cell divisions (2Weissmann C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). So far, and in contrast to yeast in which hsp104-dependent fragmentation is required for prion maintenance during successive cell divisions (30Romanova N.V. Chernoff Y.O. Protein Pept. Lett. 2009; 16: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), no such activity has been identified for mammalian prions. The discovery of small infectious PrPres aggregates further documents the diversity of abnormal PrP extracted from infected cells and tissues. Other small PrP aggregates have been detected and isolated in infected cells and tissues (11Pastrana M.A. Sajnani G. Onisko B. Castilla J. Morales R. Soto C. Requena J.R.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12868-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast to the small infectious PrPres aggregates described here, the previously described small PrP aggregates are sensitive to PK digestion, and no evidence indicates that they can transmit disease (31Cronier S. Gros N. Tattum M.H. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Wadsworth J.D. Biochem. J. 2008; 416: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Deleault A.M. Deleault N.R. Harris B.T. Rees J.R. Supattapone S. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 2642-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Small infectious PrPres aggregates, such as those described here, might give a molecular basis for the perplexing presence of infectivity in soluble preparations of infected hamster brain (33Berardi V.A. Cardone F. Valanzano A. Lu M. Pocchiari M. Transfusion. 2006; 46: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also, in a very recent study (10Tixador P. Herzog L. Reine F. Jaumain E. Chapuis J. Le Dur A. Laude H. Béringue V. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000859Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), density gradients were used to fractionate detergent-solubilized brain homogenate from tg338 mice infected with the ovine prion agent (PG127) used here. Strikingly, fractions of low density, well separated from the bulk of large PrPres aggregates in heavier fractions, contained high levels of infectivity. The molecular basis of infectivity in the light fractions, not addressed in Tixador's study, may involve the small PrPres aggregates characterized in our work. Several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson, Alzheimer, Huntington, and prion diseases, are characterized by the misfolding and the aggregation of specific proteins (34Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Although early hypotheses considered the large insoluble aggregates as the only toxic entities, an important emerging view is that small soluble prefibrillar assemblies may be more efficient biological entities to promote cell death (35Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 36Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). The toxic entities responsible for prion-mediated neuronal cell death and the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear (37Harrison C.F. Barnham K.J. Hill A.F. J.

https://openalex.org/W2086337230,"It is well documented that protein kinase A (PKA) acts as a negative regulator of M phase promoting factor (MPF) by phosphorylating cell division cycle 25 homolog B (Cdc25B) in mammals. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we identified PKA phosphorylation sites in vitro by LC-MS/MS analysis, including Ser(149), Ser(229), and Ser(321) of Cdc25B, and explored the role of Ser(149) in G(2)/M transition of fertilized mouse eggs. The results showed that the overexpressed Cdc25B-S149A mutant initiated efficient MPF activation by direct dephosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr(15), resulting in triggering mitosis prior to Cdc25B-WT. Conversely, overexpression of the phosphomimic Cdc25B-S149D mutant showed no significant difference in comparison with the control groups. Furthermore, we found that Cdc25B-Ser(149) was phosphorylated at G(1) and S phases, whereas dephosphorylated at G(2) and M phases, and the phosphorylation of Cdc25B-Ser(149) was modulated by PKA in vivo. In addition, we examined endogenous and exogenous Cdc25B, which were expressed mostly in the cytoplasm at the G(1) and S phases and translocated to the nucleus at the G(2) phase. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that Ser(149) may be another potential PKA phosphorylation target of Cdc25B in G(2)/M transition of fertilized mouse eggs and Cdc25B as a direct downstream substrate of PKA in mammals, which plays important roles in the regulation of early development of mouse embryos."

However, little is known about the regulation of the two other p53-family members, p63 and p73, by nitrogen oxides. We report here an up-regulation of p73 by NO in p53-null K-562 leukemia cells. Chemical NO prodrugs or macrophage iNOS activity induced an accumulation of the TAp73α isoform in these cells, whereas macrophages from iNOS−/− mice did not. NO also up-regulated TAp73 mRNA expression, suggesting a transcriptional regulation. The checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 can regulate TAp73 induction after DNA damage. We show that these kinases were rapidly phosphorylated upon NO treatment. Genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 impaired NO-mediated accumulation of TAp73α. Because NO is known to block DNA synthesis through ribonucleotide reductase inhibition, the up-regulation of TAp73α might be caused by DNA damage induced by an arrest of DNA replication forks. In support of this hypothesis, DNA replication inhibitors such as hydroxyurea and aphidicolin similarly enhanced TAp73α expression and Chk1 phosphorylation. Moreover, inhibition of Chk1 also prevented TAp73α accumulation in response to replication inhibitors. The knockdown of TAp73 with siRNA sensitized K-562 cells to apoptosis induced by a nitrosative (NO) or oxidative (H2O2) injury. Therefore, TAp73α has an unusual cytoprotective role in K-562 cells, contrasting with its pro-apoptotic functions in many other cell models.

In conclusion, NO up-regulates several p53 family members displaying pro- and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a complex network of interactions and cross-regulations between NO production and p53-related proteins. NO is a free radical implicated in numerous physiological functions. In cancer biology, both positive and negative actions of NO have been reported. For example, NO was found to promote tumor growth angiogenesis, and metastasis on the one hand and to induce apoptotic cell death or tumor cytostasis on the other hand (1Jenkins D.C. Charles I.G.

NO not only reacts directly on target molecules but also exerts its effects through derived species with a higher degree of oxidation and generated from NO interaction with O2 (e.g. N2O3, •NO2) or superoxide anion (ONOO−). Those reactive nitrogen species can act as potent nitrosating, nitrating, or oxidizing agents. Given this complex chemistry, the biological outcome of NO is directed by its concentration, the cellular redox environment, and different target susceptibilities. High fluxes of NO are generated by inducible NO synthase (iNOS), 3The abbreviations used are: iNOSinducible NO synthaseTAtransactivation domainSNAPS-nitrosothiol S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamineDETA-NO(Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]dia-zen-1-ium-1,2-diolateBSOl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximineH2DCFDA2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluoresceine diacetateJC-15,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodideROSreactive oxygen speciesRnrribonucleotide reductaseΔΨmmitochondrial membrane potential. transcriptionally induced in immune cells such as macrophages by cytokines and bacterial products (e.g. IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide).

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a key player in the DNA damage response and the onset of apoptosis. NO has been shown to activate p53 at high concentrations, which also promote genotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects (3Thomas D.D. Ridnour L.A. Isenberg J.S. Flores-Santana W. Switzer C.H. Donzelli S.

Because p53 is a transcription factor regulating the expression of several genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, activation of p53 by NO can be considered as a regulatory mechanism preventing the emergence of NO-induced DNA mutations and, hence, tumorigenesis. Augmentation of mutation rates in p53-deficient cells exposed to high NO doses and repression of iNOS gene transcription by p53 in a negative feedback loop are occurrences that strongly support a major role for p53 in the control of NO-induced genotoxicity (7Forrester K.

The p53 family members have a similar structural organization comprising an NH2-terminal transactivation domain (TA), a central DNA binding domain, and a COOH-terminal oligomerization domain (12Bénard J. Douc-Rasy S. Ahomadegbe J.C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Deyoung M.P. Ellisen L.W.

In p63 and p73, an additional sterile-α motif and a transcription inhibitory domain may follow the oligomerization domain. Sequence homology among the three members is limited to 25–40% identity between TA and oligomerization domain regions but increases to 60–80% amino acid identity within the DNA binding domain. These structural similarities enable physical and functional interactions between the p53-family proteins. All three p53-family members are expressed as a variety of isoforms, resulting from the usage of two distinct promoters (P1 and P2) and mRNA differential splicing at the 5′- and 3′-ends. There is now no doubt that p73 and p63 are, like p53, involved in tumor suppression (16Tomasini R. Tsuchihara K. Wilhelm M. Fujitani M. Rufini A. Cheung C.C. Khan F. Itie-Youten A. Wakeham A.

However, the p73 and p63 homologues have additional important functions. For instance, in mice p73 and p63 are crucial to proper neural and epithelial development, respectively, whereas the embryonic development of p53-null mice is almost normal (19Yang A. Walker N.

The human p73 gene generates two groups of isoforms, one with a complete TA domain comprising nine COOH-terminal splice variants (named TAp73α, β, γ, ..) and the other encompassing at least six other proteins exhibiting a truncated TA domain, produced either from the P1 promoter and NH2-terminal splicing (e.g. ΔEx2p73, ΔEx2/3p73) or from the P2 promoter within intron 3 (ΔNp73). COOH-terminal splice variants such as ΔNp73α and ΔNp73β also exist within the group lacking an entire TA domain. TAp73 isoforms can induce the transcription of an overlapping subset of p53 target genes such as CDKN1A, GADD45, Bax, PUMA, and SFN, but specific targets have been also identified (22Harms K.

Growth suppression or induction of apoptosis can be accomplished by TAp73 isoforms in cooperation with p53 (24Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T.

Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that p73 is required for apoptosis induction in response to DNA damage by chemotherapeutic drugs, and these findings can explain the relative effectiveness of anti-cancer agents in p53-defective tumor cells (27Müller M. Schleithoff E.S. Stremmel W. Melino G. Krammer P.H. Schilling T. Drug Resist. Updat. 2006; 9: 288-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in the p73 gene are rare in cancer patients. On the contrary, up-regulation of p73 was frequently observed. In particular, deregulated expression of isoforms containing a truncated TA domain, especially ΔNp73, has been demonstrated in several human cancers (27Müller M. Schleithoff E.S. Stremmel W. Melino G. Krammer P.H. Schilling T. Drug Resist. Updat. 2006; 9: 288-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Domínguez G. García J.M. Peña C. Silva J. García V. Martínez L. Maximiano C.

Oncol. 2006; 24: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). p73 isoforms lacking the TA domain are transactivation-deficient and do not induce growth suppression or cell death. They behave as dominant-negative proteins by competing with p53 and TAp73 variants at specific DNA binding sequences on promoters and by forming heteroduplexes with TAp73 and TAp63 proteins. The antiapoptotic role of ΔNp73 is crucial during mouse neural development, but it can also confer survival advantages and chemotherapeutic drug resistance in tumors by several mechanisms (27Müller M.

The oncogenic properties of NH2-terminal-truncated p73 isoforms may help to understand the absence of mutations and overexpression of p73 in tumors. Because ΔNp73 expression is transcriptionally activated by p53 and TAp73, it is implicated in a feedback mechanism that attenuates p53 and TAp73 transcriptional functions, including the p53-dependent DNA damage response, as demonstrated in a recent study using ΔNp73−/− mice (30Wilhelm M.T. Rufini A. Wetzel M.K. Tsuchihara K. Inoue S. Tomasini R. Itie-Youten A. Wakeham A. Arsenian-Henriksson M. Melino G. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of TAp73 activation by genotoxic agents and γ-irradiation have been investigated and have led to the identification of a variety of transcriptional and post-translational regulatory pathways (Refs. 13Deyoung M.P. Ellisen L.W. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5169-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 14Vilgelm A. El-Rifai W. Zaika A. Drug Resist. Updat. 2008; 11: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and references therein). Among others, phosphorylation of TAp73 by the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, the JNK and p38 MAP kinases (the latter via c-Abl-mediated activation), or the Chk1 checkpoint kinase stabilizes the protein and increases its transcriptional activity, especially toward pro-apoptotic target genes. The ATM serine-protein kinase activated by DNA damage lies upstream in the pathways leading to TAp73 activation by c-Abl and Chk1. TAp73 activity is also regulated by protein degradation. Indeed, the E3 ubiquitin ligases Itch and MDM2 have opposite effects on p73 half-life. Itch-dependent ubiquitination of p73 targets it to proteasomal degradation, whereas physical association of p73 with MDM2 enhances its stability but inhibits its transcriptional activity. Contrasting with p53 regulation, augmentation of p73 mRNA levels is an important aspect of p73 activation in response to DNA damage. The E2F1 transcription factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation binds to E2F sites within the P1 promoter of the p73 gene and activates the transcriptional expression of TAp73α and TAp73β isoforms in response to oncogenic stress. Phosphorylation of E2F1 by the Chk1/Chk2 checkpoint kinases can increase E2F-1 levels and, as a consequence, transcription of TAp73 isoforms (31Urist M. Tanaka T. Poyurovsky M.V. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several important players acting in the regulatory network controlling p73 activity have been previously shown to be involved in NO-dependent p53 activation. For instance, ATM/ATR DNA damage sensors, the stress-responsive p38 MAP kinase, and MDM2 have been implicated in p53 regulation by NO (32Wang X. Michael D. de Murcia G. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15697-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Kim S.J. Hwang S.G. Shin D.Y. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol.

There is, thus, a possibility that those events that activate p53 could also increase p73 transcriptional activity. A number of studies have accumulated that describe the interplay between p53 and nitrogen oxides. However, more than 10 years after the discovery of the other two p53-related proteins and to the best of our knowledge, the potential regulation of p73 or p63 by NO has not been thoroughly investigated. In this report, we started to address this question by examining the effect of genotoxic, high concentrations of NO on TAp73 expression in a p53-deficient human leukemia cell line. Two NO-generating compounds were used. The S-nitrosothiol S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) was synthesized according to Field et al. (35Field L. Dilts R.V. Ravichandran R. Lenhert P.G. Carnahan G.E. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; 1157: 249-250Crossref Google Scholar). Depending on the reductive power of its environment, SNAP decomposition generates either the •NO radical or a nitrosating species. It is a powerful nitrosating agent via transnitrosation reactions. (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]dia-zen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NO) was obtained from Cayman chemicals. DETA-NO decomposition gives rise mostly to the free radical •NO. Hydroxyurea, resveratrol, 4-propoxyphenol, aphidicolin, adriamycin® (doxorubicin), caffeine, UCN-01, 3-methyladenine, l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO), propidium iodide, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella enteritidis, and paraquat (methyl viologen) were purchased from Sigma. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluoresceine diacetate (H2DCFDA), S-ethyl-isothiourea, FITC-annexin V, and gemcitabine were obtained, respectively, from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Merck/Calbiochem, BD Pharmingen, and Lilly France. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) was also obtained from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes. Primary antibodies to p73 (IMG-246, Imgenex, and A300-126A, Bethyl Laboratories), Chk1, NQO1, and Crk-L (sc-8408, sc-32793, and sc-319 respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Chk1 and phospho-Chk2 (2348 and 2661 respectively, Cell Signaling), β-actin and α-tubulin (A 5316 and T 9026, Sigma) were used for immunoblotting. Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (A 8924, Sigma) or anti-rabbit (sc-2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) IgG as well as fluorescent Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated anti-mouse (A 21057, Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) or IRDye 800CW-conjugated anti-rabbit (926–32211, LI-COR Biosciences) IgG were used for detection. The human leukemia cell line K-562 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES and antibiotics. Cultures were grown in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 6-well culture plates at 0.75 × 106 cells per well in 5 ml of culture medium and allowed to recover for 24 h. They were then treated from 30 min to 48 h with NO prodrugs or DNA synthesis inhibitors and finally harvested for protein or RNA extraction. In some experiments caffeine, 3-methyladenine, UCN-01, or Chir-124 were added 30 min before other treatments. For GSH depletion, tumor cells were incubated for 18 h with 100 μm BSO, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium, as described previously (36Petit J.F. Nicaise M. Lepoivre M. Guissani A. Lemaire G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were then processed normally for subsequent treatments. Peritoneal macrophages elicited by the intraperitoneal injection of thioglycolate broth were obtained from C57Bl/6 mice and stimulated as previously described (37Guittet O. Tebbi A. Cottet M.H. Vésin F. Lepoivre M. Nitric. Oxide. 2008; 19: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also employed macrophages isolated from genetically iNOS-deficient mice (38MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar) kindly given by Dr. Charles-Henry Cottart from the Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France). Briefly, macrophages were seeded into 6-well culture plates at a density of 0.3 to 2 × 106 cells/well. Induction of iNOS expression was performed by stimulation for 24 h with mouse IFN-γ and LPS. After elimination of nonadherent peritoneal cells, K-562 cells were added at a concentration of 2 × 106 per well in 5 ml of fresh culture medium containing LPS to maintain iNOS expression. Cocultures were incubated for up to 48 h. Tumor cells were then gently harvested and processed for immunoblotting. Culture supernatant was recovered for nitrite assay with Griess reagent (37Guittet O. Tebbi A. Cottet M.H. Vésin F. Lepoivre M. Nitric. Oxide. 2008; 19: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Crude cell extracts were prepared in a 50 mm Tris.HCl lysis buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors including 1 mm Pefabloc (Merck/Calbiochem). The soluble proteins (usually 30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking of the membrane with 5% skimmed milk, incubation with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washings, and chemiluminescent detection of the antigens were performed as described in Guittet et al. (37Guittet O. Tebbi A. Cottet M.H. Vésin F. Lepoivre M. Nitric. Oxide. 2008; 19: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To ameliorate the quantification of the immunoblots, we also used the two-color infrared imaging system from LI-COR Biosciences. In these experiments, membranes were blocked with 2.5% skimmed milk or 5% BSA (A3059, Sigma) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween). After overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies and four washings in PBS/Tween, membranes were incubated for 1 h with fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies. They were then washed four times in PBS/Tween and twice in PBS. The infrared fluorescent signals at 680 and 800 nm were recorded and quantified with an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR Biosciences). Expression of up to three loading controls (Crk-L, β-actin, and α-tubulin) was also analyzed in each experiment. The signal intensity for each band of interest in a treated sample was first normalized relative to the untreated sample. Then, to take into account variations in protein loading and transfer onto the membrane, the mean of all normalized loading control signals was calculated and used to divide the normalized signal intensity for each antigen. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A quantity of 2 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed on a Light Cycler 2.0 apparatus (Roche Applied Science) using the LightCycler® FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). Each PCR cycle consisted of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 67 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C. Results were normalized to β-actin RNA levels. The following pairs of oligonucleotides were used: TAp73, 5′-GGCTGCGACGGCTGCAGAGC-3′/5′-GCTCAGCAGATTGAACTGGGCCATG-3′; β-actin, 5′-ACGAGTCCGGCCCCTCCATC-3′/5′-TGGGGGATGCTCGCTCCAAC-3′; ΔNp73, 5′-CAAACGGCCCGCATGTTCCC-3′/5′-TGGTCCATGGTGCTGCTCAGC-3′; and p21CDKN1A, as described by Guittet et al. (37Guittet O. Tebbi A. Cottet M.H. Vésin F. Lepoivre M. Nitric. Oxide. 2008; 19: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). K-562 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA using a Nucleofector kit V and a Nucleofector II device (all from Lonza) set to program T-016 according to the manufacturer's protocol. We used validated siRNA targeted to p53 and TAp73 mRNA (37Guittet O. Tebbi A. Cottet M.H. Vésin F. Lepoivre M. Nitric. Oxide. 2008; 19: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as well as a siRNA targeted to Chk1 (stealth siRNA HSS101855, Invitrogen), a siRNA against p63, and a scrambled siRNA control (both from Dharmacon). Depletion of TAp73 mRNA and inhibition of protein expression were maximal at 24 h and decreased thereafter. Therefore, transfected cells were used 24 h after nucleofection. FITC-Annexin V (BD Pharmingen) was used to detect apoptosis by flow cytometry. Briefly, 1 × 106 K-562 cells were transfected with siRNA as described above. After 24 h of recovery, half of these cells were treated by 0.5 mm DETA-NO for 24 h. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, washed twice in cold PBS, and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 100 μl of a binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Cells were then stained with 5 μl of FITC-annexin V and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, 400 μl of binding buffer were added, and the cells were subjected to FACS analysis within 1 h. At least 10,000 events were acquired by a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the CellQuestTM program. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by scoring for annexin V-positive cells. Variation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using the JC-1 lipophilic cationic fluorescent dye. K-562 cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of JC-1 solution (10 μg/ml in PBS) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were analyzed immediately with a FACScan flow cytometer. The green and red fluorescence signals were detected at 530 nm (FL1 channel) and 575 nm (FL2 channel) for JC-1 monomers and aggregates, respectively. We counted 10,000 cells for each sample in acquisition and analyzed them using CellQuestTM software. ΔΨm variations are indicated by fluctuations in the ratio of red to green fluorescence, which is dependent only on the membrane potential. Mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in this ratio. The lipophilic fluorogen H2DCFDA is retained in viable cells and converted intracellularly to a fluorescent fluorescein derivative after oxidation by ROS. K-562 cells previously transfected with siRNA and treated for 24 h with 0.1 mm H2O2 or 6 μg/ml paraquat were harvested, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES containing 10 μm H2DCFDA. After dye loading for 1 h at room temperature, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in prewarmed complete culture medium, and incubated for 30 min in a humidified incubator at 37 °C to allow oxidation of the dye. The green fluorescence intensity of the cells was analyzed immediately by a FACScan flow cytometer. NO has been reported to activate p53 in various cellular mod"
https://openalex.org/W2025538350,"Visual saliency is the perceptual quality that makes some items in visual scenes stand out from their immediate contexts. Visual saliency plays important roles in natural vision in that saliency can direct eye movements, deploy attention, and facilitate tasks like object detection and scene understanding. A central unsolved issue is: What features should be encoded in the early visual cortex for detecting salient features in natural scenes? To explore this important issue, we propose a hypothesis that visual saliency is based on efficient encoding of the probability distributions (PDs) of visual variables in specific contexts in natural scenes, referred to as context-mediated PDs in natural scenes. In this concept, computational units in the model of the early visual system do not act as feature detectors but rather as estimators of the context-mediated PDs of a full range of visual variables in natural scenes, which directly give rise to a measure of visual saliency of any input stimulus. To test this hypothesis, we developed a model of the context-mediated PDs in natural scenes using a modified algorithm for independent component analysis (ICA) and derived a measure of visual saliency based on these PDs estimated from a set of natural scenes. We demonstrated that visual saliency based on the context-mediated PDs in natural scenes effectively predicts human gaze in free-viewing of both static and dynamic natural scenes. This study suggests that the computation based on the context-mediated PDs of visual variables in natural scenes may underlie the neural mechanism in the early visual cortex for detecting salient features in natural scenes."

https://openalex.org/W1986125141,"Recently, an exact binomial test called SGoF (Sequential Goodness-of-Fit) has been introduced as a new method for handling high dimensional testing problems. SGoF looks for statistical significance when comparing the amount of null hypotheses individually rejected at level γ = 0.05 with the expected amount under the intersection null, and then proceeds to declare a number of effects accordingly. SGoF detects an increasing proportion of true effects with the number of tests, unlike other methods for which the opposite is true. It is worth mentioning that the choice γ = 0.05 is not essential to the SGoF procedure, and more power may be reached at other values of γ depending on the situation. In this paper we enhance the possibilities of SGoF by letting the γ vary on the whole interval (0,1). In this way, we introduce the 'SGoFicance Trace' (from SGoF's significance trace), a graphical complement to SGoF which can help to make decisions in multiple-testing problems. A script has been written for the computation in R of the SGoFicance Trace. This script is available from the web site http://webs.uvigo.es/acraaj/SGoFicance.htm."

https://openalex.org/W2068042031,"Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is a major cause of hospitalization for children in China, while the etiological diagnosis of ALRI remains a challenge. This study was performed to evaluate the utility of the blind Nasotracheal aspiration (NTA) in the pathogen detection in ALRI through an evaluation of the test's specificity.A hospital-based study of children ≤3 years was carried out from March 2006 through March 2007 in Suzhou University Affiliated Children's Hospital, including 379 cases with ALRI from the respiratory wards, and 394 controls receiving elective surgery. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and NTA specimens were taken on admission. S. pneumoniae was isolated from 10.3% of NTA samples from ALRI children, H. influenzae from 15.3%, and M. catarrhalis from 4.7%. The false positive rate--the strains from NTA in control group children--was 8.4% (95% CI: 5.8%-11.4%) for S. pneumoniae, 27.2% (95% CI: 22.7-31.5%) for H. influenzae, and 22.1% (95% CI: 18.0%-26.2%) for M. catarrhalis. The agreement between NPS and NTA in the control group was over 70%.The blind NTA test is not a useful test for etiologic diagnosis of ALRI."
