https://openalex.org/W2149615364,"The potent lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) regulates diverse physiological processes by binding to 5 specific GPCRs, although it also has intracellular targets. Here, we demonstrate that S1P, produced in the mitochondria mainly by sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), binds with high affinity and specificity to prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a highly conserved protein that regulates mitochondrial assembly and function. In contrast, S1P did not bind to the closely related protein PHB1, which forms large, multimeric complexes with PHB2. In mitochondria from SphK2-null mice, a new aberrant band of cytochrome-c oxidase was detected by blue native PAGE, and interaction between subunit IV of cytochrome-c oxidase and PHB2 was greatly reduced. Moreover, depletion of SphK2 or PHB2 led to a dysfunction in mitochondrial respiration through cytochrome-c oxidase. Our data point to a new action of S1P in mitochondria and suggest that interaction of S1P with homomeric PHB2 is important for cytochrome-c oxidase assembly and mitochondrial respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2143500009,"Amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases generates several biologically active products, including amyloid-β (Aβ) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). AICD regulates transcription of several neuronal genes, especially the Aβ-degrading enzyme, neprilysin (NEP). APP exists in several alternatively spliced isoforms, APP695, APP751, and APP770. We have examined whether each isoform can contribute to AICD generation and hence up-regulation of NEP expression. Using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells stably expressing each of the APP isoforms, we observed that only APP695 up-regulated nuclear AICD levels (9-fold) and NEP expression (6-fold). Increased NEP expression was abolished by a β- or γ-secretase inhibitor but not an α-secretase inhibitor. This correlated with a marked increase in both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in APP695 cells as compared with APP751 or APP770 cells. Similar phenomena were observed in Neuro2a but not HEK293 cells. SH-SY5Y cells expressing the Swedish mutant of APP695 also showed an increase in Aβ levels and NEP expression as compared with wild-type APP695 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that AICD was associated with the NEP promoter in APP695, Neuro2a, and APPSwe cells but not APP751 nor APP770 cells where AICD was replaced by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). AICD occupancy of the NEP promoter was replaced by HDAC1 after treatment of the APP695 cells with a β- but not an α-secretase inhibitor. The increased AICD and NEP levels were significantly reduced in cholesterol-depleted APP695 cells. In conclusion, Aβ and functional AICD appear to be preferentially synthesized through β-secretase action on APP695.

P-type ATPases usually pump small cations and the transport mechanism involved appears conserved throughout the family. How this mechanism is adapted to flip phospholipids remains to be established. P4-ATPases form heteromeric complexes with CDC50 proteins. Dissociation of the yeast P4-ATPase Drs2p from its binding partner Cdc50p disrupts catalytic activity (Lenoir, G., Williamson, P., Puts, C.

The human genome encodes 14 P4-ATPases while only three human CDC50 homologues have been identified. This implies that each human CDC50 protein interacts with multiple P4-ATPases or, alternatively, that some human P4-ATPases function without a CDC50 binding partner. Here we show that human CDC50 proteins each bind multiple class-1 P4-ATPases, and that in all cases examined, association with a CDC50 subunit is required for P4-ATPase export from the ER. Moreover, we find that phosphorylation of the catalytically important Asp residue in human P4-ATPases ATP8B1 and ATP8B2 is critically dependent on their CDC50 subunit.

A widely held concept is that lipid asymmetry is generated and maintained by ATP-fuelled translocases that catalyze unidirectional transport of phospholipids across the bilayer (10Devaux P.F.

A prime example is the aminophospholipid translocase in red blood cells that mediates a rapid transport of PS and PE from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane (12Seigneuret M.

Besides P4-ATPases, the superfamily of P-type pumps includes soft-transitional metal-transporting ATPases (P1), Ca2+-ATPases (P2A/B), Na+/K+-ATPases, and H+/K+-ATPases (P2C), and H+-ATPases (P3) (24Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Transport is accomplished by cycling changes between two main enzyme conformations, E1 and E2, during which the ATPase is transiently phosphorylated by ATP at an invariant aspartate residue (hence the designation P-type). This arrangement allows for a controlled opening and closing of cytoplasmic and exoplasmic pathways that give access to the cation-binding sites, which are buried inside the membrane-spanning region of the pump (25Kühlbrandt W.

Differences are largely confined to the cation-binding pocket, which consists of a congregation of glutamates and aspartates whose anionic carboxyl groups serve to neutralize the charge of the cations. In P4-ATPases, these anionic residues have been largely replaced by a mixture of hydrophobic and polar uncharged residues (16Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 31Lenoir G. Williamson P. Holthuis J.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Yet how the conserved mechanism of P-type ATPase-mediated cation transport is adapted in P4-ATPases to flip phospholipids is not understood. P4-ATPases form heteromeric complexes with members of the CDC50 protein family (32Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 18: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). CDC50 proteins consist of two membrane spans and a large exoplasmic loop, which is stabilized by one or more disulfide bonds. Mutation of CDC50 genes in yeast and Arabidopsis has been shown to phenocopy P4-ATPase mutations and disrupt aminophospholipid transport and asymmetry (18Poulsen L.R. López-Marqués R.L. McDowell S.C.

Presumably, this is because assembly of a P4-ATPase/CDC50 complex is a prerequisite for P4-ATPase export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)(18Poulsen L.R. López-Marqués R.L. McDowell S.C. Okkeri J.

Whereas these studies clearly demonstrate that CDC50 proteins are indispensable for proper intracellular targeting of P4-ATPases, they do not address whether CDC50 proteins also contribute to the transport properties of the complex. An intimate role for CDC50 proteins in P4-ATPase-catalyzed phospholipid transport can be inferred from our recent finding that dissociation of the yeast P4-ATPase Drs2p from its binding partner Cdc50p disrupts the ability of the enzyme to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate (39Lenoir G. Williamson P. Puts C.F. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17956-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Using a genetic reporter system, we also found that the affinity of Drs2p for Cdc50p fluctuates during the reaction cycle with the strongest interaction occurring at or near a point where the enzyme is loaded with phospholipid ligand (39Lenoir G. Williamson P. Puts C.F. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17956-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that CDC50 proteins play a critical role in the P4-ATPase transport reaction. Yeast contains three CDC50 homologues on five P4-ATPases (32Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3418-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) while Arabidopsis has five CDC50 homologues on 12 P4-ATPases (18Poulsen L.R.

Most strikingly, the human genome encodes only three CDC50 homologues on a total of 14 different P4-ATPases (40Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1741: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of one of the CDC50 homologues, CDC50C, is restricted to testis (41Katoh Y. Katoh M. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 12: 939-943PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that each human CDC50 protein interacts with multiple P4-ATPases or, alternatively, that some human P4-ATPases function alone. To gain further insight into the role of CDC50 proteins in P4-ATPase-catalyzed phospholipid transport, we here set out to systematically map physical and functional interactions between human class-1 P4-ATPase and CDC50 family members. HeLa and Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Colbe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. UPS-1 cells (a kind gift of K. Hanada, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) were grown in Ham's F12 Medium (Invitrogen, Leek, the Netherlands) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 at 32 °C. Sf9 insect cells were grown in InsectXpress Medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Lonza Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) at 27 °C. Commercially available cDNAs (RZPD, Berlin, Germany; Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan; NITE, Chiba, Japan; JCRB, Tokyo, Japan) were used as templates to PCR amplify and subclone the open reading frames of human ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, CDC50A, CDC50B, and macaque CDC50C into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). A full-length cDNA of ATP8A1 was kindly provided by L. Klomp (UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands). A triple HA (HA3) and polyhistidine (His8 or His10) tag or a HA3 and monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) tag was added to the C terminus of the P4-ATPases while a V5-tag was added to the C terminus of the CDC50 subunits by fusion PCR. Enzymatically inactive P4-ATPases with a single point mutation replacing the phosphorylatable aspartate residue were created by side-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) based on the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa and UPS-1 cells were transfected with the resulting plasmids using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) or Effectene (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer. To differentiate between cDNA and genomic DNA, primers were designed at distinct sites of the exon-exon boundaries (Table 1). P4-ATPase primers were all chosen in the C-terminal tail, which displays the highest sequence variation. CDC50B primers match sequences in the 3′-UTR around the single exon-exon boundary present in the transcript. HeLa and Caco-2 cells were grown confluent in 10 cm ø dishes. RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and RT-PCR was performed using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche Diagnostics BV, Almere, the Netherlands). To verify CDC50B primers, PCR was performed on genomic DNA of HeLa and Caco-2 cells by omitting the RT-step of the Titan One Tube RT-PCR protocol and starting with an extra 2 min at 94 °C.TABLE 1RT-PCR primer sequencesmRNAForward primer sequenceReverse primer sequenceATP8A15′-acatgttgaagtaccctgaat-3′5′-aaaagcagtcctcttgataacct-3′ATP8A25′-gtcactgcatcaacgccttgg-3′5′-ttgctatcccgcagcaccgcttt-3′ATP8B15′-gttgctgtgtgcttactacc-3′5′-tcagctgtccccggtgc-3′ATP8B25′-gggctcttcgacatgtttc-3′5′-gccaacccgccgcatgcagcg-3′ATP8B35′-agtatcccccacgaccttc-3′5′-tgggctcgaagctgcctc-3′ATP8B45′-gccttggataccagttactg-3′5′-gctaaagctgctcacggtg-3′CDC50A5′-atggcgatgaactataacg-3′5′-aatggtaatgtcagctgtattac-3′CDC50B5′-tgaggcccacaaattacctg-3′5′-ataaactggtaagatgatatcac-3′CDC50C5′-atggaggagagagcacagc-3′5′-gcactttgatttgtacagatga-3′ Open table in a new tab HeLa and UPS-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips to 50% confluency and transfected with different P4-ATPases and/or CDC50 expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Effectene (Qiagen).

HeLa cells were transfected with different combinations of P4-ATPase and CDC50 expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and grown for another 3 days. Prior to cell lysis, protein expression was induced for 10–16 h with 1 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS+ (PBS, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml apoprotein, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 157 μg/ml benzamidine), and solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h with 1% digitonin dissolved in PBS+. The extract was cleared of cell debris and insoluble material by two subsequent centrifugation steps (18,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C and 100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). In the presence of 0.2% BSA, the solubilized fraction was incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with anti-V5-agarose affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing, beads were incubated at 48 °C for 5 min with SDS/urea sample buffer containing protease inhibitors, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using rabbit anti-V5 (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-HA (Santa Cruz, Heerhugowaard, the Netherlands), and rabbit anti-ATP1A1 antibody (C356-M09, kindly provided by J. Koenderink, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Baculovirus stocks for heterologous expression of human ATP8B1, ATP8B1D454N, ATP8B2, ATP8B2D425N, and CDC50A were generated using the BAC-to-BAC system (Invitrogen). HA3/His10-tagged P4-ATPases and V5-tagged CDC50A were subcloned into pFastBacDual plasmids. Viral DNA was prepared following the BAC-to-BAC system manual. Viral stocks were prepared according to protocols obtained from R. Callaghan (Oxford University, UK). In brief, Sf9 cells were transfected with bacmid DNA using Cellfectin (Invitrogen). 5–7 days post-transfection, culture medium containing virus particles was harvested and subjected to a plaque assay to subclone obtained viral particles. The ensuing viral supernatants were amplified in three successive infection steps with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 to obtain a viral working stock for large-scale infections. Viral supernatants were stored protected from light at 4 °C. Sf9 cells were grown overnight and infected at a cell density of 3 × 106 cells/ml with the desired viral stocks (MOI = 10). After 1 h of incubation at 27 °C, cell suspension was diluted with InsectXpress supplemented with 5% FBS to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. 3 days post-infection, cells were controlled for signs of infection and harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing the cells with PBS, the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C. Sf9 cells expressing ATP8B1, ATP8B1D454N, ATP8B2, ATP8B2D425N, and/or CDC50A were lysed with four rounds of nitrogen cavitation (1500 psi, 20 min, on ice) in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors). Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C), and membranes were collected at 100,000 × g (1 h, 4 °C). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay (Perbio, Breda, the Netherlands). Proteins of interest were purified as previously described by Lenoir et al. (39Lenoir G. Williamson P. Puts C.F. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17956-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml of either DOPC/DOPA (9:1) or DOPC/DOPA/DOPS (7:1:2). Briefly, membranes were resuspended to 2 mg of membrane protein/ml in 5 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.5% digitonin, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors) and gently shaken at 4 °C for 2 h. Insoluble fraction was pelleted by a 100,000 × g spin (1 h, 4 °C). Under gentle agitation, detergent-solubilized material was incubated with 100 μl of pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) per mg of membrane protein for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were transferred to a column and washed with 40 volumes of washing buffer 1 (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% digitonin, 0.2 mg/ml lipids) and 30 volumes of washing buffer 2 (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 25 mm imidazole, 0.05% digitonin, 0.2 mg/ml lipids). Proteins were eluted in 5 fractions of 400 μl of elution buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% digitonin, 0.2 mg/ml lipids), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Purification fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting using mouse anti-HA (12CA5, Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibodies. The amount of affinity-purified P4-ATPase was estimated by silver staining using purified Ca2+-ATPase derived from rabbit muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum as a reference. 32P labeling of purified Ca2+-ATPase was carried out as previously described (39Lenoir G. Williamson P. Puts C.F. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17956-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified P4-ATPase/CDC50 protein complexes were preincubated with 1 mg/ml of desired lipid mixture at 4 °C for 1 h under gentle agitation. For [γ-32P]ATP labeling, ∼6 ng of affinity-purified P4-ATPase were incubated at 4 °C for 30 s with 0.2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 mCi/μmol) in 150 μl of phosphorylation buffer (50 mm MOPS/Tris pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% digitonin, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase) in the presence or absence of 200 μm orthovanadate. Dephosphorylation was initiated at 20 °C by addition of 5 mm ATP or ADP. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped by acid quenching with ice-cold 16% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) supplemented with 5 mm H3PO4. After a 30 min incubation on ice, protein precipitates were collected at 18,000 × g (25 min, 4 °C), washed with 800 μl of 7% TCA containing 0.5 mm H3PO4 and incubated on ice for 30 min. The TCA solution was carefully removed after two subsequent centrifugation steps of 18,000 × g (25 and 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (150 mm TrisHCl pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 16% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) by shaking at 25 °C for 30 min. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE following the method of Sarkadi (47Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gárdos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An Imaging Plate (Fujifilm, Steenbergen, the Netherlands) was exposed for 1–5 days to the Coomassie Blue R250-stained and dried SDS gels. Radioactive phosphorylation was detected by a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and quantified against known amounts of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were corrected for variations in protein precipitation by quantification of Coomassie Blue R250-stained pyruvate kinase. To systematically investigate interactions between human P4-ATPases and CDC50 proteins, we first analyzed their endogenous expression in human HeLa cervical carcinoma and Caco-2 intestinal carcinoma cells. For P4-ATPases we focused on the six members of the ATP8 or class-1 cluster, i.e. ATP8A1, ATP8A2, ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B3, and ATP8B4. RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of mRNA for all six ATPases in HeLa cells, and for all except ATP8B3 in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, both cell types contained mRNA for CDC50A, but lacked any detectable amount of mRNA for the other two CDC50 family members, CDC50B and CDC50C (Fig. 1B). This indicates that HeLa and Caco-2 cells each contain CDC50A as the only putative P4-ATPase interaction partner. ATP8B1 and its binding partner CDC50A are localized at the apical membrane of hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells (38Paulusma C.C. Folmer D.E. Ho-Mok K.S. de Waart D.R. Hilarius P.M.

We therefore analyzed the subcellular distribution of epitope-tagged versions of these proteins in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that HA-tagged ATP8B1, ATP8B2, and ATP8B4 localize primarily at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). HA-tagged ATP8A1, on the other hand, displayed a perinuclear staining and co-localized with the Golgi marker formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase (FTCD), indicating that this enzyme resides in the Golgi complex. When expressed at very high levels, these P4-ATPases also showed a nuclear-envelope and reticular staining that coincided with the ER marker protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; Fig. 2A, ATP8B4-HA-positive cell marked with an asterisk). When expressed at moderate levels, V5-tagged CDC50A and CDC50B each localized mainly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). In contrast, V5-tagged CDC50C was never found at the plasma membrane and localized exclusively in the ER and perinuclear region. To directly test for physical interactions between human class-1 P4-ATPases and CDC50 proteins, we next performed immunoprecipitation studies on HeLa cells transiently transfected with different combinations of HA-tagged P4-ATPase and V5-tagged CDC50 expression constructs. Expression of tagged protein was verified by immunoblot"
https://openalex.org/W2039010779,"Chlamydia trachomatis infections cause severe and irreversible damage that can lead to infertility and blindness in both males and females. Following infection of epithelial cells, Chlamydia induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Unconventionally, Chlamydiae use ROS to their advantage by activating caspase-1, which contributes to chlamydial growth. NLRX1, a member of the Nod-like receptor family that translocates to the mitochondria, can augment ROS production from the mitochondria following Shigella flexneri infections. However, in general, ROS can also be produced by membrane-bound NADPH oxidases. Given the importance of ROS-induced caspase-1 activation in growth of the chlamydial vacuole, we investigated the sources of ROS production in epithelial cells following infection with C. trachomatis. In this study, we provide evidence that basal levels of ROS are generated during chlamydial infection by NADPH oxidase, but ROS levels, regardless of their source, are enhanced by an NLRX1-dependent mechanism. Significantly, the presence of NLRX1 is required for optimal chlamydial growth."
https://openalex.org/W2058712031,"At the earliest stage of activation, human polymorphonuclear neutrophils release vesicles derived directly from the cell surface. These vesicles, called ectosomes (PMN-Ect), expose phosphatidylserine in the outer membrane leaflet. They inhibit the inflammatory response of human monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells to zymosan A (ZymA) and LPS and induce TGF-β1 release, suggesting a reprogramming toward a tolerogenic phenotype. The receptors and signaling pathways involved have not yet been defined. Here, we demonstrate that PMN-Ect interfered with ZymA activation of macrophages via inhibition of NFκB p65 phosphorylation and NFκB translocation. The MerTK (Mer receptor tyrosine kinase) and PI3K/Akt pathways played a key role in this immunomodulatory effect as shown using specific MerTK-blocking antibodies and PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. As a result, PMN-Ect reduced the transcription of many proinflammatory genes in ZymA-activated macrophages. In sum, PMN-Ect interacted with the macrophages by activation of the MerTK pathway responsible for down-modulation of the proinflammatory signals generated by ZymA."
https://openalex.org/W2098083113,"Acute inflammation in healthy individuals is self-limiting and has an active termination program. The mechanisms by which acute inflammation is resolved are of interest. In murine zymosan-induced peritonitis, we found that eosinophils are recruited to the inflamed loci during the resolution phase of acute inflammation. In vivo depletion of eosinophils caused a resolution deficit, namely impaired lymphatic drainage with reduced appearance of phagocytes carrying engulfed zymosan in the draining lymph node, and sustained numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in inflamed tissues. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based lipidomics of the resolving exudates revealed that locally activated eosinophils in the resolution phase produced proresolving mediators, including protectin D1 (PD1) from docosahexaenoic acid. The resolution deficit caused by eosinophil depletion was rescued by eosinophil restoration or the administration of PD1. Eosinophils deficient in 12/15-lipoxygenase could not rescue the resolution phenotype. The present results indicate that mouse eosinophils and eosinophil-derived lipid mediators, including PD1, have a role in promoting the resolution of acute inflammation, expanding the roles of eosinophils in host defense and resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2017470884,"Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing compounds selectively targeting mitochondria for the treatment of neoplasms. The critical role of mitochondria in cellular metabolism and respiration supports this therapeutic rationale. Dysfunction in the processes of energy production and metabolism contributes to attenuation of response to pro-apoptotic stimuli and increased ROS production both of which are implicated in the initiation and progression of most human cancers.A high-throughput MTT-based screen of over 10,000 drug-like small molecules for anti-proliferative activity identified the phosphonium salts TP187, 197 and 421 as having IC₅₀ concentrations in the submicromolar range. TP treatment induced cell cycle arrest independent of p53 status, as determined by analysis of DNA content in propidium iodide stained cells. In a mouse model of human breast cancer, TP-treated mice showed significantly decreased tumor growth compared to vehicle or paclitaxel treated mice. No toxicities or organ damage were observed following TP treatment. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections from TP187-treated tumors demonstrated a decrease in cellular proliferation and increased caspase-3 cleavage. The fluorescent properties of analog TP421 were exploited to assess subcellular uptake of TP compounds, demonstrating mitochondrial localization. Following mitochondrial uptake cells exhibited decreased oxygen consumption and concomittant increase in mitochondrial superoxide production. Proteomics analysis of results from a 600 target antibody microarray demonstrated that TP compounds significantly affected signaling pathways relevant to growth and proliferation.Through our continued interest in designing compounds targeting cancer-cell metabolism, the Warburg effect, and mitochondria we recently discovered a series of novel, small-molecule compounds containing a triphenylphosphine moiety that show remarkable activity in a panel of cancer cell lines as well as in a mouse model of human breast cancer. The mechanism of action includes mitochondrial localization causing decreased oxygen consumption, increased superoxide production and attenuated growth factor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2051478150,"Given the modulatory role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the immune system, we investigated the effect of NPY on the production of NO and IL-1β in microglia. Upon LPS stimulation, NPY treatment inhibited NO production as well as the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Pharmacological studies with a selective Y1 receptor agonist and selective antagonists for Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors demonstrated that inhibition of NO production and iNOS expression was mediated exclusively through Y1 receptor activation. Microglial cells stimulated with LPS and ATP responded with a massive release of IL-1β, as measured by ELISA. NPY inhibited this effect, suggesting that it can strongly impair the release of IL-1β. Furthermore, we observed that IL-1β stimulation induced NO production and that the use of a selective IL-1 receptor antagonist prevented NO production upon LPS stimulation. Moreover, NPY acting through Y1 receptor inhibited LPS-stimulated release of IL-1β, inhibiting NO synthesis. IL-1β activation of NF-κB was inhibited by NPY treatment, as observed by confocal microscopy and Western blotting analysis of nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit, leading to the decrease of NO synthesis. Our results showed that upon LPS challenge, microglial cells release IL-1β, promoting the production of NO through a NF-κB-dependent pathway. Also, NPY was able to strongly inhibit NO synthesis through Y1 receptor activation, which prevents IL-1β release and thus inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W1989630854,"Spider silks are spun from concentrated solutions of spidroin proteins. The appropriate timing of spidroin assembly into organized fibers must be highly regulated to avoid premature fiber formation. Chemical and physical signals presented to the silk proteins as they pass from the ampulle and through the tapered duct include changes in ionic environment and pH as well as the introduction of shear forces. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of spidroins from the major ampullate gland (MaSp-NTDs) for both Nephila and Latrodectus spiders associate noncovalently as homodimers. The MaSp-NTDs are highly pH-responsive and undergo a structural transition in the physiological pH range of the spider duct. Tryptophan fluorescence of the MaSp-NTDs reveals a change in conformation when pH is decreased, and the pH at which the transition occurs is determined by the amount and type of salt present. Size exclusion chromatography and pulldown assays both indicate that the lower pH conformation is associated with a significantly increased MaSp-NTD homodimer stability. By transducing the duct pH signal into specific protein-protein interactions, this conserved spidroin domain likely contributes significantly to the silk-spinning process. Based on these results, we propose a model of spider silk assembly dynamics as mediated through the MaSp-NTD. Spider silks are spun from concentrated solutions of spidroin proteins.

Based on these results, we propose a model of spider silk assembly dynamics as mediated through the MaSp-NTD. Spider silks are protein-based fibers with remarkable mechanical qualities. Perhaps even more impressive is the spinning process in which the spider silk proteins (spidroins) are assembled from a highly soluble storage state into a well ordered and insoluble fiber. Spiders can produce up to seven different types of silk each composed of different spidroin proteins and spun from distinct abdominal glands (1Lewis R.V. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3762-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Here, the spinning process of the major ampullate gland of Nephila spiders will be summarized as an example, but many of its features are common to other spider silks and are even analogous to moth and butterfly silks. Prior to spinning, the spidroins are stored in the gland at a very high concentration (∼300 g liter−1) that causes them to adopt a liquid crystalline arrangement (2Chen X. Knight D.P. Vollrath F. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 3Knight D.P. Vollrath F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 266: 519-523Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the stored spidroins is a mix of random coil and α-helices (4Hijirida D.H. Do K.G. Michal C. Wong S. Zax D. Jelinski L.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3442-3447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). When there is a demand for silk fiber, the spidroin solution is drawn down a long and tapered duct in which the proteins experience a gradual change in their chemical environment (5Knight D.P. Vollrath F. Naturwissenschaften. 2001; 88: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Along the length of the duct, Na+ drops from 3.1 mg g−1 dry weight in the ampulle (where the spidroins are stored) to 0.3 mg g−1 in the fiber, and K+ increases from 0.75 to 2.9 mg g−1 (6Chen X. Huang Y.F. Shao Z.Z. Huang Y. Zhou P. Knight D.P. Vollrath F. Chem. J. Chin. 2004; 25: 1160-1163Google Scholar). Phosphate concentration also increases at least 5-fold, whereas flow velocity and shear force increase (especially near the end) because of the tapered geometry of the duct (5Knight D.P. Vollrath F. Naturwissenschaften. 2001; 88: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Breslauer D.N. Lee L.P. Muller S.J. Biomacromolecules. 2009; 10: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Importantly, pH drops from 7.2 in the storage region to 6.3 in the first 0.5 mm of the duct and reaches an unknown value by the end of the ∼20-mm duct (8Dicko C. Vollrath F. Kenney J.M. Biomacromolecules. 2004; 5: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Collectively, these chemical and physical forces induce the spidroin molecules to align with the direction of flow, form β-sheets, and partition out of the aqueous phase to form a solid fiber (9Knight D.P. Knight M.M. Vollrath F. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2000; 27: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Lefèvre T. Boudreault S. Cloutier C. Pézolet M. Biomacromolecules. 2008; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fiber produced from the major ampullate gland is called dragline silk, and it is used in the main structural elements of an orb web and also as a hanging lifeline. Its primary protein constituents are major ampullate spidroins 1 and 2 (MaSp1 and MaSp2) (11Sponner A. Schlott B. Vollrath F. Unger E. Grosse F. Weisshart K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4727-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Xu M. Lewis R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These proteins are highly repetitive molecules having a 30–40-amino acid consensus sequence repeated ∼100 times in tandem (14Ayoub N.A. Garb J.E. Tinghitella R.M. Collin M.A. Hayashi C.Y. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e514Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Flanking this repeat array are short nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains (NTDs 2The abbreviations used are: NTDN-terminal domainCTDC-terminal domainMaSpmajor ampullate spidroinSECsize exclusion chromatographyNcN. clavipesLmL. mactansEaE. australis. and CTDs) of ∼155 and ∼100 amino acids, respectively (12Xu M.

Biomacromolecules. 2005; 6: 3152-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The CTDs are conserved, not just among major ampullate spidroins but among all fiber-forming spidroins, as are the N-terminal domains for all spidroins for which 5′ gene sequences are currently known (16Hu X. Vasanthavada K. Kohler K. McNary S. Moore A.M. Vierra C.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1986-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because these domains have been conserved over hundreds of millions of years of spider evolution, they likely confer an important function on spidroin proteins. In studies of recombinant partial spidroins, it has been clearly established that the CTDs of major ampullate spidroins (generically MaSp-CTDs) play a significant role in promoting and coordinating spidroin assembly (17Huemmerich D.

However, less is known about the contribution of MaSp-NTDs (generically referring to MaSp1 and MaSp2 of any species) to spidroin function. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of MaSp-NTD has led to predictions that its secondary structure consists mainly of five α-helices (15Motriuk-Smith D. Smith A. Hayashi C.Y. Lewis R.V. Biomacromolecules. 2005; 6: 3152-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is also predicted that a signal peptide is present on MaSp-NTD that directs secretion of the spidroin into the gland lumen and is likely proteolytically removed during secretion.

Nature. 2010; 465: 236-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) presented a crystal structure of an Euprosthenops MaSp-NTD dimer and biochemical data indicating the NTD undergoes pH-induced conformational change. In this study, we examine recombinant Nephila and Latrodectus MaSp-NTD proteins to further elucidate functionally relevant biochemical features. We show that MaSp-NTDs from Nephila and Latrodectus spiders also change conformation in response to the pH decrease that occurs in the silk gland and that this change is sensitive to the ionic environment. In addition, the conformational change leads to a stabilization of MaSp-NTD dimerization that likely has functional significance to the fiber-spinning process. Three MaSp N-terminal domains (MaSp1A-NTD and MaSp2-NTD from Nephila clavipes and MaSp1-NTD from L. mactans) were isolated from N. clavipes or Latrodectus mactans genomic DNA by PCR with homolog-specific primer sets. The forward primer for each homolog begins at the predicted signal peptide cleavage site such that the recombinant proteins will resemble mature, native MaSp-NTD. Each primer set included a stop codon at the end of the MaSp-NTD and a 5′ XmaI site and 3′ XhoI site for subsequent ligation into pGEX-6P-2 plasmid (GE Healthcare). BL21 cells harboring the plasmids were cultured, and protein expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Proteins were purified from sonication lysates by affinity to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), and affinity tags were removed by PreScission protease digestion. The purified MaSp-NTDs were eluted from the column and subsequently concentrated on a 10-kDa cutoff Amicon (Millipore) ultracentrifugal filtration device. After GST removal, vector-derived “GPLGSPGIPG” remained on the N-terminal end of the MaSp-NTDs (supplemental Fig. S1). The purified proteins were assayed by SDS-PAGE with staining by Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. Measurements were performed in a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technologies International model 814) using a 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvette. Protein sample was excited at 295 nm, and emission spectra were taken from 310 to 370 nm at 2-nm steps. For pH titrations, the MaSp-NTD protein was diluted to ∼3 μm into 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES buffer, 0.1 μm fluorescein, with 20, 100, or 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 or 5.0. Each titration began with a reading of the pH 7.5 buffer with protein in a constantly stirred cell. A volume (which varied between steps to give a constant 0.1 pH unit change per step) was removed, and an equal volume of pH 5.0 buffer with same protein and salt concentration was added to decrease pH but leave all other conditions unchanged. At each step, Trp fluorescence and fluorescein fluorescence readings were taken. This was repeated with increasing volumes of replacement until the pH reached 5.0. Fluorescein was used as a pH probe by monitoring the ratio of emission intensities at 508 nm when excited with 450 and 490 nm of light. Calibration was performed at 0.5 pH unit steps from pH 5.0 to 7.5 in the same buffer used for titrations and fitted to a sigmoidal regression. For readings other than the pH titrations, MaSp-NTD proteins were diluted into 1 ml of separate buffers prepared at 0.5 pH unit steps, mixed by pipetting, and read. The presence of fluorescein had no significant effect on MaSp-NTD Trp fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S2). Sephacryl S-100 (GE Healthcare) resin was packed into a 1.6-cm diameter by 27-cm height column with a total volume of 55 ml. The running buffers were 10 mm MES, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 or 5.5, with NaCl of 0, 100, 500, or 1000 mm. A molecular mass standard set consisting of vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa), RNase A (13.7 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa) was chromatographed under each buffer condition used. The MaSp-NTD samples were 200 μm protein in 100 μl of appropriate running buffer and were allowed to equilibrate with the buffer for 5 min prior to injection onto the column. The flow rate was 0.5 ml min−1, and fractions were collected every 1.5 ml. These fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm that the UV absorbing peaks were indeed MaSp-NTD protein. The molecular mass estimates of MaSp-NTD oligomers were calculated by regression on the buffer appropriate marker set. Measurements were performed on a Brookhaven Instruments 90Plus particle sizer and analyzed with accompanying software. Protein samples were at a concentration of 0.8 g liter−1 (53 μm) in 300 μl of buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm citrate, 20 mm NaCl, variable pH). Protein samples and buffers were all thoroughly filtered to remove dust. After measurement at 20 mm NaCl, concentrated NaCl was added to a final concentration of 100 mm, and measurements were performed again. Each sample was measured at a 90° angle for 3 min in triplicate. CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco J-810 CD spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. The quartz cuvette had a 1-mm path length and 300-μl internal volume. Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein was 20 μm in buffer with 10 mm NaH2PO4 at pH 7.0 or 5.5 with either 0 or 500 mm NaF. NaF was substituted for NaCl due to the lower UV absorbance. For each melt/anneal experiment, CD spectra from 260 to 190 nm were first recorded at 20 °C. The sample was heated at 5 °C min−1 to 90 °C and then cooled at the same rate down to 20 °C. All spectra presented are the average of three scans and are blanked against the appropriate buffer. MaSp-NTD proteins (Nc.MaSp1A-NTD, Nc.MaSp2-NTD, and Lm.MaSp1-NTD) were covalently coupled to Affi-Gel® 10 resin (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions at a protein density of 3.5 mg protein ml−1 of resin. BSA was coupled separately at 5.0 mg protein ml−1 resin. The protein-coupled resins were washed thoroughly with buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.0, to wash away any noncovalently bound proteins. Pulldowns were performed in 10 mm MES, 10 mm HEPES at varied pH (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, or 7.0) and varied NaCl (20, 100, or 200 mm) for a total of 15 conditions. In a total volume of 30 μl, 5 μl of resin bearing 17.5 μg of immobilized MaSp-NTD and 10 μg (22 μm) of free MaSp-NTD of the same type were present. This was incubated overnight at room temperature to allow free dimers to dissociate and permit dimerization with immobilized protein. Next, the volume was increased to 100 μl with binding buffer (matching the pH and salt concentration of that treatment), mixed gently, incubated for 30 s, centrifuged (2000 rpm, 15 s), and the supernatant was removed. This was repeated twice for a total of three washes. The washed resin was then resuspended in 80 μl of elution buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with 200 mm NaCl and 1% SDS) and incubated for 15 min with periodic agitation. The elution was removed from the resin and BCA assayed to determine the amount of MaSp-NTD pulled down. The pulldowns of free MaSp-NTD using immobilized MaSp-NTD were performed in triplicate. Pulldowns of free MaSp-NTD using immobilized BSA under all 15 conditions were also performed as a control, and mock pulldowns (no free MaSp-NTD) were performed for each resin to ensure no immobilized protein was released from the resin. SDS-PAGE of the eluted protein was performed to ensure that only MaSp-NTD protein was present in the elution. Pulldowns with an extended wash time course were initiated by overnight incubation of an appropriately scaled binding reaction at pH 5.5 with 20 mm NaCl to promote maximal binding (240 μl of resin bearing immobilized Nc.MaSp1A-NTD and 480 μg (22 μm) of free Nc.MaSp1A-NTD in 1.14 ml total volume). The resin was subsequently washed with pH 5.5 buffer three times to remove unbound protein and distributed into 48 tubes. Buffer (2 ml) at the appropriate pH containing 20 mm NaCl was added, and the resin was rotated for variable time periods before elution of remaining protein. We have cloned and overexpressed the NTDs of N. clavipes MaSp1A and MaSp2 (Nc.MaSp1A and Nc.MaSp2, respectively) and of L. mactans MaSp1 (Lm.MaSp1) as GST fusions in Escherichia coli (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1 for details). The two N. clavipes MaSp-NTDs were based on our previously isolated sequences (23Gaines 4th., W.A. Marcotte Jr., W.R. Insect Mol. Biol. 2008; 17: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and that of L. mactans on sequences isolated as part of this study. Interestingly, the L. mactans MaSp1-NTD differs by only a single conservative amino acid change (Leu to Ile) from MaSp1 locus 1 (L1) and locus 2 (L2) from Latrodectus hesperus (24Ayoub N.A. Hayashi C.Y. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MaSp-NTD proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography and subsequent removal of the affinity tag resulting in recombinant proteins with >95% homogeneity (Fig. 1). All three MaSp-NTDs examined in this paper have a single tryptophan residue at position 5 or 6 after the predicted signal peptide cleavage site (supplemental Fig. S1). This amino acid fluoresces when excited with light at 295 nm. The fluorescent emission varies in intensity and wavelength depending on the local environment surrounding the Trp side chain. If a Trp residue is solvent-exposed, it will emit fewer photons and at a longer (less energetic) wavelength compared with a Trp residue in a more hydrophobic context. Therefore, Trp fluorescence can be used as a sensor for local structural changes. We examined the Trp fluorescence of our recombinant Nc.MaSp1A-NTD under a variety of buffer conditions, with particular emphasis on those that are known to change along the major ampullate duct (pH, [Na+], [K+], phosphate). Trp fluorescence changes dramatically when the pH is titrated from 7.5 to 5.0 (Fig. 2A), decreasing in intensity and red-shifting indicating that the Trp residue becomes more solvent-exposed at lower pH. Trp fluorescence is unaffected by the 10 non-native amino acids at the N-terminal end of the MaSp1A-NTD as the spectra obtained are virtually identical when four different non-native amino acids are present (supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, the ionic strength of the buffer had an impact on the change in Trp fluorescence during the pH titration. High NaCl concentrations caused the Trp residue to remain buried at a more acidic pH compared with lower salt buffers (Fig. 2B) indicating that increased ionic strength stabilizes the more fluorescent conformation. Similar results were obtained for the Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein using a variety of buffer systems (MES/HEPES, phosphate, and Tris/citrate). The conformational change occurred in less than 1 min under all conditions as this was the amount of time between mixing the protein and taking the first reading, and no further conformational change was observed in any subsequent readings. As evidence that this conformational change is not specific to the Nc.MaSp1A-NTD, the Trp fluorescence spectra for both Nc.MaSp2-NTD and Lm.MaSp1-NTD, including the salt effect, are essentially the same as that for Nc.MaSp1A-NTD (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively). In addition to NaCl, we assessed Nc.MaSp1A-NTD Trp fluorescence in buffers containing KCl and sodium phosphate as well as mixtures of NaCl and KCl at various concentrations and pH. In all cases, the trends are similar to that observed with NaCl in that overall fluorescence decreases as pH is lowered and increased ionic strength shifts the pH at which the conformational change occurs toward more acidic values (supplemental Fig. S4A and data not shown). In contrast, MgCl2 and CaCl2 had a more potent effect on Trp fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S4A). Both divalent cations appear to have stabilized the more fluorescent conformation across the range of pH 7.0 to 6.0 with only a moderate decrease in Trp fluorescence at pH 5.5. Hedhammar et al. (19Hedhammar M. Rising A. Grip S. Martinez A.S. Nordling K. Casals C. Stark M. Johansson J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3407-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of Euprosthenops australis MaSp1 (Ea.MaSp1-NTD) elutes during size exclusion chromatography (SEC) at pH 7.4 and low ionic strength at a mass consistent with a homodimer. We wished to determine whether the three MaSp-NTDs under study here would behave similarly in a low ionic strength buffer and whether the pH and ionic strength effects we observed for Trp fluorescence would translate to alterations in the MaSp-NTD oligomeric state. When subjected to SEC in a low ionic strength buffer, pH 7.0, Nc.MaSp1A-NTD, Nc.MaSp2-NTD, and Lm.MaSp1-NTD all eluted at molecular masses consistent with homodimerization (estimated at 30.5, 27.8, and 33.5 kDa, respectively, where monomer molecular masses are 15.0, 14.9, and 14.0 kDa, respectively). Similarly, at pH 5.5 with no salt, Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein also eluted as a homodimer. To evaluate the effect of elevated salt concentrations, Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein was subjected to SEC in buffers containing 100, 500, or 1000 mm NaCl at pH 7.0 and 5.5. Under all conditions, the Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein eluted as a single peak, and oligomeric states larger than a dimer were never observed (supplemental Fig. S5). However, the estimated mass was either intermediate to monomer and dimer sizes (for moderate ionic strength buffers) or very close to monomer size (for high ionic strength buffers; Fig. 3). We interpret these intermediate molecular mass estimates to indicate that Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein is entering the column as a dimer but, upon experiencing a threshold amount of dilution, becomes monomeric and remains so for the remainder of the separation. For both pH 5.5 and 7.0, higher amounts of NaCl in the running buffer resulted in a more monomeric molecular mass estimate suggesting that increased NaCl destabilizes the self-interaction of MaSp-NTDs. However, much higher amounts of NaCl were required to shift the elution profile for Nc.MaSp1A-NTD toward monomer size at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.0 (e.g. the pH 5.5 with 1000 mm NaCl sample elutes similarly to the pH 7.0 with 100 mm NaCl sample). This could indicate the dimer association is stronger at pH 5.5. It is important to note that the elution profile of the molecular mass standards was determined under all eight buffer conditions and was unaffected by the changes in pH or ionic strength. Recently, Askarieh et al. (22Askarieh G. Hedhammar M. Nordling K. Saenz A. Casals C. Rising A. Johansson J. Knight S.D. Nature. 2010; 465: 236-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) reported that Ea.MaSp1-NTD aggregates into particles of about 800 nm diameter in a pH-dependent manner (∼pH 6). We performed dynamic light scattering measurements between pH 4.0 and 7.5 to determine whether Nc.MaSp1A-NTD and Lm.MaSp1-NTD behave similarly. Our results show that, unlike Ea.MaSp1-NTD, neither of the proteins aggregate into large assemblies at any pH or salt concentration tested (supplemental Fig. S6). To ensure that this lack of aggregation was not an experimental artifact, we also generated an Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein in which the 10 N-terminal non-native residues of our own constructs were replaced with the same four non-native residues (GSGN) present on Ea.MaSp1-NTD (Nc.MaSp1A-NTD-Mut). The change in non-native residues had no effect, and no large scale aggregation was observed (supplemental Fig. S6). Given the effects of pH and ionic strength on MaSp-NTD conformation and dimerization, it was of interest to probe the impact of these treatments on secondary structure. Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein was examined by CD spectroscopy in buffers at pH 5.5 and 7.0 with either low (0 mm) or high (500 mm NaF) salt. When samples were examined at 20 °C, the spectra were essentially identical for all buffer conditions and consistent with predominantly α-helical secondary structure. The samples were also heated to 90 °C and then cooled back to 20 °C. Under all conditions, Nc.MaSp1A-NTD protein was able to refold upon cooling and produced spectra essentially identical to the pre-melt spectra (supplemental Fig. S7). To further characterize the influence of pH and ionic strength on MaSp-NTD dimer stability, we performed pulldown experiments. MaSp-NTD proteins were covalently coupled to a resin under conditions that should favor a wide spacing of immobilized monomers (low protein concentration, 80 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) and used to capture free MaSp-NTDs of the same type from solution. The mixed free and resin-immobilized MaSp-NTD proteins were incubated overnight to ensure that dimers in free solution would have sufficient time to dissociate then dimerize with resin-immobilized monomers. The pulldowns were done under 15 different conditions that included five pH steps and three NaCl concentrations. At pH 7.0 or 6.5, almost no free MaSp-NTD protein is pulled down for all three NaCl conditions and for each of the three homologs tested (Fig. 4). Although dimers are expected to form at pH 7.0, because the association is not particularly strong, they dissociate during the wash steps and are therefore not present in the eluted protein fraction. In contrast, at pH 5.5 and 5.0 a significant fraction (ranging from 25 to 80%) of the free MaSp-NTD is pulled down for each salt condition and homolog type. Because the captured MaSp-NTD protein remains associated through two wash steps with agitation and very little MaSp-NTD protein is lost to the wash, we interpret this as an indication of stable dimer formation with resin-immobilized MaSp-NTD. The pulldown is specifically due to the MaSp-NTD dimer interaction because no free MaSp-NTD was pulled down under any conditions using resin-immobilized BSA as a control (Fig. 4). The depletion of free MaSp-NTD protein from the supernatant produced a reciprocal trend to that of the amount of protein pulled down (data not shown). Salt concentration also had an effect on the pulldown experiments. In higher salt conditions, it takes a lower pH before significant amounts of free MaSp-NTD are pulled down. These results are remarkably congruent with the Trp fluorescence titration and SEC results (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). By comparing the pulldown and Trp fluorescence results, it appears that stable dimers, as evidenced by efficient pulldown, occur only below pH values where the conformation has fully transitioned to the lower fluorescence (solvent-exposed) state. For example, at 100 mm NaCl, the Trp fluorescence completes its transition around pH 6.0 but significant pulldown does not occur until pH 5.5. Also in agreement with the Trp fluorescence data, divalent cations are more potent at disrupting pulldown than monovalent cations at equal concentrations of charges (supplemental Fig. S4B). Although 50 mm solutions of divalent cation salts do have higher ionic strength than 100 mm monovalent salts, this alone cannot explain their potency on MaSp-NTDs because they also elicit a greater effect than 200 mm NaCl (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Interestingly, resin-immobilized Nc.MaSp1A-NTD was able to pull down Nc.MaSp2-NTD to about the same degree that it pulls down Nc.MaSp1A-NTD suggesting that heterodimerization may be physiologically relevant (data not shown). To further demonstrate increased MaSp-NTD dimer stability at low pH, we performed pulldown experiments where resin with captured proteins was washed for various periods with buffer at pH of 5.5, 6.0, or 7.0 (supplemental Fig. S8). At pH 7.0 and 6.0, dimer half-life was ∼1 min (although perhaps much less at pH 7.0 given that dissociation was complete prior to the first time point tested) indicating a rapid dissociation rate due to weak dimer int"
https://openalex.org/W2155907554,"This study was undertaken to investigate the link between dietary fat content and intestinal levels of anorectic N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), including oleoylethanolamide (OEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and linoleoylethanolamide (LEA). Male rats were fed high-fat diets (HFDs) with variable percentages of fat [20-45% of total energy (E%)] for 1-7 d; afterward, the jejunums were isolated, and jejunal NAE levels were measured by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Enzyme activities and mRNA expression levels were measured for two synthesizing enzymes, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE1), and one degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). We found a dose-response relation between the quantity/percentage of dietary fat, irrespective of the energy density, and the reduction of intestinal levels of OEA, PEA, and LEA. The reductions were present after 1 d of 45E% HFD. LEA, the major NAE species, was shown to have an anorectic potency slightly less than that of OEA but higher than PEA. Regulation at the enzyme level seems not to explain the changes in NAE levels. The results suggest the presence of a fat sensor, mediating the reduced intestinal NAE levels. The intestinal NAE levels are reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to dietary fat intake, and this may contribute to the well-known hyperphagic effect of HFDs."

Accumulating lines of evidence have shown that prefibrillar intermediates of a-Syn, such as soluble oligomers or protofibrils, play a toxic role in degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and mature fibrils of a-Syn contribute toward this toxicity to a lesser extent (1Volles M.J.

Another possibility is that the impairment of the system to degrade Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn causes its accumulation. However, the process by which Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn is degraded or recycled remains unknown. This study focused on the metabolic fate of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn in cells. We report here that Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn undergoes dephosphorylation and degradation by the proteasome pathway. In addition, Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn is targeted to the proteasome pathway in a ubiquitin-independent manner. sporadic Parkinson disease cycloheximide α-synuclein okadaic acid 3-methyladenine.

Human ubiquitin cDNAs with or without a FLAG tag at the N terminus were generated by PCR (clone ID 3879581; Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL), and they were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ECACC 94030304) were maintained in a mixture of F-12 and Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The SH-SY5Y cell line stably expressing wild-type a-Syn (wt-aS/SH) was selected against with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). For transient transfection, 5 × 106 cells were transfected with 6 μg of cDNA using Nucleofector (Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector kit V; Lonza Cologne AG, Koln, Germany). The cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from Crl:CD (SD) rats as previously described (11Arawaka S. Wada M. Goto S. Karube H. Sakamoto M. Ren C.H. Koyama S. Nagasawa H. Kimura H. Kawanami T. Kurita K. Tajima K. Daimon M. Baba M. Kido T. Saino S. Goto K. Asao H. Kitanaka C. Takashita E. Hongo S. Nakamura T. Kayama T. Suzuki Y.

Briefly, neurons were isolated from the neocortex of embryonic day 18 rats and dissociated cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells on poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). Neurons were maintained in serum-free medium, which was composed of neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). At intervals of 2 days, half of the plating medium was renewed. At 21 days of culture, neurons were harvested for experiments (12Hirai Y. Fujita S.C. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For inhibition of the proteasome, at 16 h after plating wt-aS/SH cells onto 6-well plates, we checked the cells to be ∼80% confluent, and then the cells were further incubated in fresh medium containing either 10 nm okadaic acid (OA), 10 μm MG132, or 10 μm lactacystin for 4 h. As a vehicle control, cells were treated with the same concentration of DMSO, which was used for dissolving OA, MG132, and lactacystin, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 1.06 mm KH2PO4, 2.97 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 150 mm NaCl). In rat primary neuronal cultures, neurons were cultured for 21 days and then incubated in fresh medium containing either 10 nm OA, 10 μm MG132, or 10 μm lactacystin for 4 h. For inhibition of the autophagy-lysosome, at 16 h post-plating wt-aS/SH cells onto 6-well plates, we confirmed the cells to be around 50% confluent. The cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 10 mm 3-metyladenine (3-MA) or 100 μm chloroquine for up to 32 h. To assess protein half-lives in the cells, we performed experiments using the de novo protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX). At 16 h post-plating wt-aS/SH cells onto 6-well plates, we confirmed the cells to be ∼80% confluent. The cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 100 μm CHX for the indicated times. To test the effect of inhibition of the proteasome pathway or dephosphorylation on the half-lives of target proteins, we treated the cells with CHX plus either MG132 or OA. The 80% confluent wt-aS/SH cells were pre-incubated in fresh medium containing either DMSO, 10 μm MG132, or 10 nm OA for 6 h. After preincubation, CHX was added to a final concentration of 100 μm into medium. The cells were further incubated for the indicated times. For preparation of cell lysates, SH-SY5Y cells were suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mm EDTA, 1 × phosSTOP (Roche Diagnostic)) and kept on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, the resultant supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until required. In primary neuronal cultures, the cells were suspended in buffer A containing 1 μm OA, and then they were disrupted by passing through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. In the experiments for ubiquitinated proteins, the pellet from above (post-12,000 × g centrifugation step) was resuspended in the same aliquots of buffer A containing 8 m urea and was disrupted by brief sonication. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, the resultant supernatant was collected as the pellet fraction. The protein concentration was measured by the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm OA), and kept on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, the resultant supernatant was collected. The supernatants were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated with Protein G-agarose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were dissolved from the beads by heating in Laemmli's sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. For SDS-PAGE, protein samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were applied to a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed and then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab., Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was reacted with ECL (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) for the detection of β-actin, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2, and total a-Syn, including phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, or ECL plus (GE Healthcare) for the detection of other proteins. The membrane was then visualized using a CCD camera, VersaDog 5000 (Bio-Rad). Relative intensities of detected signals were quantified with Quantity one software (Bio-Rad). For detection of phosphorylated a-Syn, we added 50 mm NaF into TBS-T containing 5% milk or antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used (11Arawaka S. Wada M. Goto S. Karube H. Sakamoto M.

In experiments for estimating the protein half-lives, we quantified the relative band intensities of phosphorylated or total a-Syn by using protein standards. Recombinant non-phosphorylated a-Syn proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (14Karube H. Sakamoto M. Arawaka S. Hara S. Sato H. Ren C.H. Goto S. Koyama S. Wada M. Kawanami T. Kurita K. Kato T. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3693-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated a-Syn proteins were made by incubation of 100 μg of non-phosphorylated proteins in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP) containing 1,000 units of recombinant CK2 protein (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 16 h at 37 °C. A set of diluted non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated a-Syn proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE along with samples. After quantifying band intensities of samples with Quantity one software, they were plotted on a standard curve and corrected relative intensities. Statistical comparisons were made by unpaired Student's t test. Wt-aS/SH cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with methionine/cystine-free medium for 1 h. The cells were pulsed with methionine/cystine-free medium containing 100 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h, and subsequently chased with normal medium containing 1 mm methionine and cysteine for indicated times. After harvesting cells, immunoprecipitation using Syn-1 antibody or anti-Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn antibody was carried out. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12.5% gels and transferred to the PVDF membrane. Signals were detected by BAS-2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). Wt-aS/SH cells transfected with ubiquitin cDNA were plated on 4-chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) at 1 × 105 cells per well. After 2 days, the cells were incubated with medium containing either DMSO, 10 μm MG132, or 10 nm OA for 16 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and incubated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After blocking with 5% skim milk, they were labeled with anti-a-Syn monoclonal antibody (LB509, 1:250; Covance, Emeryville, CA) and anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (1:50) overnight at 4 °C. Then, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 37C°. The slides were analyzed with a LSM510 meta laser confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The metabolic fate of a phosphorylated protein is affected by dephosphorylation and/or degradation pathways, such as the proteasome or autophagy-lysosome pathway. Fujiwara et al. (7Fujiwara H.

This idea is supported by the findings showing that the protein phosphatase 2A/1 inhibitor, OA, increases the amount of phosphorylated a-Syn in PC12 cells (15Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S.

Karube H. Sakamoto M. Ren C.H. Koyama S. Nagasawa H. Kimura H. Kawanami T. Kurita K. Tajima K. Daimon M. Baba M. Kido T. Saino S. Goto K. Asao H. Kitanaka C. Takashita E. Hongo S. Nakamura T.

To compare the contribution of dephosphorylation to the metabolism of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn with that of degradation pathways, we first assessed the effect of OA on the metabolism of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn. In this study, we used a cell line (wt-aS/SH) stably expressing wild-type a-Syn, because it is difficult to detect Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn at endogenous levels in SH-SY5Y cells. As compared with the starting levels, the expression levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were increased 2.60 ± 0.43-fold at 2 h (mean ± S.D., p < 0.01, n = 4) and 5.53 ± 2.32-fold at 4 h (p = 0.03, n = 4) in the presence of 10 nm OA (Fig. 1). In contrast, the expression levels of total a-Syn, including non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, were constant at 0.92 ± 0.04-fold at 2 h (p = 0.125, n = 3) and 1.03 ± 0.23-fold at 4 h (p = 0.861, n = 3), when compared with starting levels (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the expression levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were moderately but significantly increased 1.82 ± 0.44-fold at 4 h in the presence of 0.1% DMSO (p = 0.014, n = 5) (Fig. 1). When the cells were incubated in medium containing 0.1% PBS for 4 h, the levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were constant (Fig. 1). The increased effect of OA on the levels of phosphorylated a-Syn was larger than that of DMSO at 4 h of post-treatment (5.53 ± 2.32-fold in OA versus 1.82 ± 0.44-fold in DMSO) (Fig. 1). We tested whether Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn was degraded by the proteasome pathway, because phosphorylation sometimes acts as a signal to target the proteins, such as IκBα (16Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) and β-catenin (17Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We treated wt-aS/SH cells with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, for 4 h. The expression levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were increased 5.07 ± 1.86-fold at 2 h (p = 0.022, n = 4) and 10.6 ± 5.46-fold at 4 h (p = 0.039, n = 4), as compared with the starting levels (Fig. 2). Treatment with another proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, also showed a 15.3 ± 8.24-fold increase in the levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn at 4 h (p = 0.04, n = 4) (Fig. 2). In contrast, the expression levels of total a-Syn were constant at 1.00 ± 0.08-fold in MG132 (p = 0.929, n = 4) and 1.00 ± 0.14-fold in lactacystin (p = 0.986, n = 4) at 4 h (Fig. 2). The increased effect of proteasome inhibitors on the levels of phosphorylated a-Syn was much larger than that of DMSO at 4 h post-treatment (15.3 ± 8.24-fold in lactacystin versus 1.82 ± 0.44-fold in DMSO) (Fig. 2). We next tested whether Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn was degraded by the autophagy-lysosome pathway. As compared with the starting levels, the expression levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were increased 2.05 ± 0.52-fold at 32 h in the presence of 10 mm 3-MA, which inhibits the formation of the autophagosome (p = 0.027, n = 3) (Fig. 3). The expression levels of total a-Syn were also increased 1.5 ± 0.06-fold at 32 h (p = 0.005, n = 3) (Fig. 3). Additionally, treatment with 100 μm of general lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine, showed that the expression levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were 6.52 ± 2.20-fold higher than the starting levels at 32 h (p = 0.049, n = 3) (Fig. 3). The expression levels of total a-Syn were found to be increased 1.39 ± 0.10-fold at 32 h (p = 0.022, n = 3) (Fig. 3). When the cells were treated with 0.1% PBS as a vehicle control, the levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated and total a-Syn were constant. Inhibition of the autophagy-lysosome pathway showed that the expression levels of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were elevated almost in parallel to those of total a-Syn by longer incubations than inhibition of the proteasome pathway. To elucidate the contribution of dephosphorylation and degradation pathways to the metabolism of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn, we determined the half-life of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn by using the de novo protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX, in wt-aS/SH cells. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the experiment using CHX showed that the amounts of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were rapidly decreased. Its estimated half-life (t½) was 54.9 ± 6.4 min. In contrast, the expression levels of total a-Syn were stable within the observation time of up to 240 min (Fig. 4, A and B). Because this finding suggested that Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn was rapidly processed by the specific pathway that differed from the non-phosphorylated form, we then focused on the role of dephosphorylation and degradation by the proteasome pathway. We treated wt-aS/SH cells with CHX plus either OA or MG132. To ensure that OA or MG132 exerts its inhibitory effect during the entire course of the experiment, we pre-treated the cells with the reagents until accumulation of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn was easily detectable. Under these conditions, treatment with OA suppressed the decrease in the amounts of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn (Fig. 4, A and B). The amounts of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were decreased to about 50% at 240 min in the presence of OA (Fig. 4, A and B). Treatment with MG132 remarkably blocked the decrease in the amounts of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn (Fig. 4, A and B). The amounts of Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn were almost constant in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 4, A and B). The amounts of total a-Syn did not change in the presence of OA or MG132 (Fig. 4, A and B). These data suggested that Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn underwent degradation mainly by the proteasome pathway rather than dephosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. We performed pulse-chase experiments after metabolic labeling. Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn was decreased between 4 and 6 h of the chase periods, while total a-Syn was almost stable in the chase period (Fig. 4C). This finding was consistent with the data from experiments using CHX. To exclude a possibility that the decrease in Ser-129-phosphorylated a-Syn was due to degradation of kinases, we examined whether treatment with CHX altered the expression levels of GRKs and CK2, which have been known to contribute to the Ser-129-phosphorylation of a-Syn (11Arawaka S.

The expression levels of ubiquitously expressing members of GRKs (GRK2, -3, -5, and -6) and CK2 α′-subunit were stable in the presence of CHX and in the presence of CHX plus either OA or MG132 during the observation times (Fig. 4D). We next assessed the metabolism of phosphorylation-mimic mutants (S129E and S129D) and phosphorylation-abolished mutant (S129A) of a-Syn. Each mutant cDNA was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells, and the cells were treated with lactacystin for 4 h. The expression levels of S129A mutant a-Syn were stable at 4 h, as compared with the starting levels (Fig. 5A). In phosphorylation-mimic mutants, the expression levels of S129E mutant a-Syn were significantly increased 1.39 ± 0.15-fold at 2 h (p = 0.014, n = 4) and 1.55 ± 0.23-fold at 4 h (p = 0.016, n = 4), as compared with the starting levels, whereas S129D mutant a-Syn did not alter the expression levels (Fig. 5A). In the experiments using CHX, S129A and S129D mutants were not decreased within 4 h (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, S129E mutant a-Syn showed a rapid decrease (Fig. 5B). Treat"

Moreover, we directly visualized the stoichiometry of mobile Orai1 channels in live cells using a new single molecule recording modality that combines single molecule tracking and brightness analysis. By alternating imaging and photobleaching pulses, we recorded trajectories of single, fluorescently labeled Orai1 channels, with each trajectory consisting of bright and dim segments, corresponding to higher and lower numbers of colocalized active GFP label. The according brightness values were used for global fitting and statistical analysis, yielding a tetrameric subunit composition of mobile Orai1 channels in resting cells.

By alternating imaging and photobleaching pulses, we recorded trajectories of single, fluorescently labeled Orai1 channels, with each trajectory consisting of bright and dim segments, corresponding to higher and lower numbers of colocalized active GFP label. The according brightness values were used for global fitting and statistical analysis, yielding a tetrameric subunit composition of mobile Orai1 channels in resting cells.

Entry of extracellular calcium is essential, e.g. for prolonged calcium signaling or for refilling the calcium stores. The best studied store-operated calcium current is the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) current in T-cells and mast cells, Icrac (2Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The key players in Icrac are STIM1 and Orai1. STIM1 is an ER membrane protein that senses the ER calcium concentration via a luminal EF-hand (3Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A.

As Orai1 has only four transmembrane domains and shows no known homology to other calcium channels, there soon have been speculations regarding the subunit stoichiometry of the channel. First, biochemical assays revealed the existence of Orai1 dimers; tetramers were found after the addition of a chemical cross-linking agent (12Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Feske S. Cruz-Guilloty F.

By introducing cysteines at specific sites in Orai1 subunits and applying disulfide cross-linking assays, it was concluded that Orai1 assembles as a tetramer or as a higher oligomer (13Zhou Y. Ramachandran S. Oh-Hora M. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4896-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A study employing electron microscopy reported a tetrameric stoichiometry of purified Orai1 proteins (14Maruyama Y. Ogura T. Mio K. Kato K. Kaneko T. Kiyonaka S. Mori Y. Sato C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13676-13685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Coexpression of preassembled tandem Orai1 multimers with a dominant-negative mutant revealed that functional pores are formed by tetrameric Orai1 assemblies (15Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). More detailed insights were obtained by direct single molecule imaging approaches (16Ji W. Xu P. Li Z.

Safrina O. Parker I. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2008; 456: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) reported Orai dimers in resting Xenopus laevis oocytes that associated to tetramers only upon coexpression of the STIM C terminus. The latter data were particularly interesting as they suggested a unique mechanism for the activator protein STIM to assemble the functional Orai tetramer. Due to the apparent discrepancy between the results of the two single molecule studies and their restriction to the analysis of immobile or immobilized proteins, we decided to design a more versatile approach, which allows for the determination of the subunit stoichiometry of mobile resting state Orai1. Our rationale was that mobile subfractions provide the cleanest pool of data, devoid of contributions, e.g. from potentially preassociated STIM1-Orai1 complexes or vesicles attached to the plasma membrane; moreover, resting state Orai1 is predominantly mobile (8Park C.Y. Hoover P.J. Mullins F.M. Bachhawat P. Covington E.D. Raunser S. Walz T. Garcia K.C. Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Cell. 2009; 136: 876-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), and mobility appears critical for the lateral redistribution upon store depletion. In this report, we describe the methodology and provide evidence that in mammalian cells mobile resting state Orai1 shows tetrameric assembly. Orai1 tandem repeat constructs were subcloned from pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen) via internal restriction sites BglII/SalI and BamHI/XbaI and cloned into ECFP and EYFP-C1 (Clontech). To generate the Orai1-mGFP-N1 construct, monomeric GFP (20Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) was amplified from pJB20-GPI-mGFP (21Schwarzenbacher M. Kaltenbrunner M. Brameshuber M. Hesch C. Paster W. Weghuber J.

The PCR product was digested with AgeI and NotI and cloned into the Orai1-YFP-N1 vector (7Muik M. Frischauf I. Derler I. Fahrner M. Bergsmann J. Eder P. Schindl R. Hesch C. Polzinger B. Fritsch R.

All resulting constructs were confirmed by sequencing. HEK-293 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 8.5% CO2 in DMEM (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (PAA). For FRET and electrophysiology experiments, cells were transferred to glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes 2 days before the experiments and transfected using TransFectin (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions on the day before the experiment. T24 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin (PAA), and grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. 70% confluent cells were harvested and transfected with 10 μg Orai1-mGFP-N1 plasmid DNA using the X-Cell electroporator (Bio-Rad) with following electroporation settings: 240 V, 950 μF, unlimited resistance, 4-mm gap cuvettes. Cells were plated into 100-mm culture dishes and grown for 48 h. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. Medium was changed every 3 days, and 15–20 days later, individual neomycin-resistant colonies were selected for further propagation. T24-Orai1-mGFP cells were passaged 1–2 days before experiments and seeded on glass slides, which have been coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at room temperature. For characterization of STIM1/Orai1 coupling, T24-cells were transfected using TransFectin according to the manufacturer's instructions 2 days before the experiments and seeded on glass slides 1 day before the experiment. FRET measurements were performed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200 M, Zeiss) equipped with a Nipkow disk confocal scanner according to Muik et al. (7Muik M. Frischauf I. Derler I. Fahrner M. Bergsmann J. Eder P. Schindl R. Hesch C. Polzinger B. Fritsch R. Kahr H. Madl J. Gruber H. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8014-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The light source was a multiline Ar+-laser combined with an acousto-optic tunable filter. The illumination time was 900 ms. Fluorescence emission was separated using a long pass filter (505 LP) and two emission filters for CFP and YFP and recorded on two cameras (CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics). The setup was controlled using MetaMorph 5 (Universal Imaging). Cells were transfected with CFP-Orai1-Orai1 and YFP-Orai1-Orai1 and optionally STIM1. For the measurements, the coverslips were mounted in a cell bath containing an extracellular buffer solution with 2 mm calcium. Stores were depleted using 2 μm thapsigargin (Sigma-Aldrich). All FRET experiments were performed at room temperature. FRET was evaluated using the normalized FRET method of Xia and Liu (22Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Briefly, FRET images were corrected for cross-talk and direct excitation. Calibration values were obtained from cells expressing only the CFP- or YFP-labeled constructs. Images were analyzed on a pixel per pixel basis using custom-made programs in Matlab as described in more detail in Ref. 7Muik M. Frischauf I. Derler I. Fahrner M. Bergsmann J. Eder P. Schindl R.

HEK-293 cells were transfected with CFP-STIM1 and either YFP-Orai1 or YFP-Orai1-Orai1-tandem repeat constructs. Measurements were carried out in paired comparison on the same day. Expression pattern and levels of the Orai1 constructs in HEK cells were examined carefully by confocal fluorescence microscopy and were not significantly different due to the linkage of two Orai1 proteins. For testing Orai1-mGFP functionality, HEK-293 cells were transfected with Orai1-mGFP and mCherry-STIM1. For store depletion, the internal pipette solution contained the following: 145 mm caesium methane sulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and pH was 7.2. To prevent store depletion, the internal pipette solution contained 100 nm free Ca2+ by additionally including 4.3 mm Ca2+. Extracellular solution consisted of the following: 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Wild-type T24 cells and T24 cells stably expressing Orai1-mGFP were compared using a whole-cell recording configuration under resting state conditions. The internal pipette solution included the following: 3.5 mm MgCl2, 145 mm caesium methane sulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 4.3 mm CaCl2. For blocking of Orai1 channels, 10 μm lanthan was added after 300 s of recording. For current measurements, voltage ramps were usually applied every 5 s from a holding potential of 0 mV, covering a range of −90 to 90 mV for 1 s. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature. Characterization experiments (see Fig. 2A) were performed on a home-built epifluorescence scanning microscope (23Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Sonnleitner A. Freudenthaler G. Jacak J. Höglinger O. Schindler H. Schütz G.J. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 5960-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) based on a commercial Axiovert 200 body (Zeiss). The samples were illuminated in total internal reflection configuration with the 488-nm line of an Ar+-laser (Innova, Coherent) via a 100× objective (numerical aperture, 1.45, α-Fluar, Zeiss). Fluorescence was imaged onto a back-illuminated CCD camera (NTE/CCD-1340/100-EMB, Roper Scientific). Single band filters for CFP, YFP, and GFP were used for the respective fluorophores (Chroma). T24 cells were transfected using YFP-Orai1 and CFP-STIM1. Expression of both constructs was checked prior to store-operated calcium entry activation. Stores were depleted using 30 μm 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ, Sigma-Aldrich) in Hanks' buffered saline solution without calcium and magnesium. During store depletion, the YFP channel was monitored. The same store depletion protocol was used for T24 cells stably expressing Orai1-mGFP. These experiments were performed at room temperature. Single molecule fluorescence and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed on a customized epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss). Samples were illuminated via a 100× objective (Plan-Apochromat; numerical aperture, 1.45; Zeiss) using the 488-nm line of an Ar+-ion laser (Stabilite 2017-AR, Spectra Physics) either in total internal reflection or conventional epifluorescence configuration. An acousto-optical modulator (model 1205C, Isomet) was used to control both illumination time and excitation power. The acousto-optical modulator was operated as outlined below (see Fig. 3A) for single molecule measurements. For FRAP analysis, an ∼3.5 × 3.3 μm2 region was bleached at high power for 600 ms. For brightness analysis, a region of ∼17 × 17 μm2 was bleached. We used two power levels, 5.2 kilowatts/cm2 at the object plane (high in Fig. 3A) and 180 watts/cm2 (low in Fig. 3A). The illumination time for imaging was set to 50 ms at low power. A fast-spinning diffuser disk was placed in the beam path to homogenize the illumination profile at the sample. Excitation light and fluorescence emission were separated using a GFP dichroic and emission filter (Semrock). Fluorescence signals were recorded on a back-illuminated liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD camera (Micro Max 1300-PB, Roper Scientific). The camera chip was operated in kinetics mode to achieve minimal delay times between consecutive images of tdel = 1 ms. Due to the kinetics mode the number of readout images per measuring sequence was limited. The region of interest in y direction was reduced to 50 pixels in the central part of the photobleached area, which allowed for acquiring of 23 images per sequence. The microscope was equipped with a temperature control system (POCmini, Zeiss) and a home-built temperature box. All single molecule fluorescence and FRAP experiments were performed at 37 °C. Data were analyzed using our algorithms implemented in Matlab (MathWorks). For FRAP analysis of the mobile fraction, the central part of the bleached region was evaluated by integrating all counts and normalizing to the prebleach image. The FRAP curve in the inset shown in Fig. 2C shows mean and S.D. from measurements on 11 T24-Orai1-mGFP cells. For diffusion analysis, the positions of single Orai1 pores r→ were determined with Matlab software as described previously (24Wieser S. Schütz G.J. Methods. 2008; 46: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mean square displacements were calculated for various time lags (tlag). The diffusion coefficient was determined from the slope of a linear regression of the first two data points in the plot according to Equation 1.MSD(tlag)=〈r→(tlag)2〉 =4⋅D⋅tlag+Coffset(Eq. 1) The negative offset of the linear regression is a consequence of the molecular motion during the illumination (24Wieser S. Schütz G.J. Methods. 2008; 46: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Goulian M. Simon S.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2188-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For brightness analysis, a 3 × 3 pixel square (i.e. 600 × 600 nm) was centered at the brightest pixel of a diffraction limited fluorescent spot (see Fig. 3D). The background was estimated from a 5 × 5 pixel ring surrounding this area. Continuous probability density functions were generated from the discrete data sets using a kernel smoothed density estimate (ksdensity, Matlab). The brightness of different numbers of colocalized copies of mGFP was approximated using Gaussian functions (26Schmidt T. Schutz G.J. Gruber H.J. Schindler H. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 4397-4401Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Mashanov G.I. Nobles M. Harmer S.C. Molloy J.E. Tinker A. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18557-18562Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a set of three linear combinations of n Gaussians was used to model the entire brightness distribution (where j = 1, 2, or 3),pj(B)dB=∑i=1Nαijσi2π⋅exp−12(B−μiσi)2dB(Eq. 2) where pj(B) denotes the probability for measuring the brightness (B) for data set j. N is the total number of Gaussians used for the respective function set to model the brightness distributions, i.e. the presumed number of mGFPs per Orai1 pore. Index (i) is used for indexing the individual Gaussians. For the global fit, the same means μi and widths σi were used to fit the three data sets, whereas the weights αij were allowed to vary throughout the distinct data sets. The sum of the weights αij was constrained to be 1 for each data set j. The three data sets were fitted globally using a least-square nonlinear fitting routine, yielding the fit parameters (μi, σi, αij; i = 1, … ,N; j = 1, 2, 3) according to the model used. The starting parameters were chosen from visual inspection of the individual brightness distributions. The stability of global fitting was tested by randomly varying all starting parameters in a reasonable range. The fits using 2- and 4-Gaussians were extremely stable, the results of the 3- and 5-Gaussian fits slightly varied depending on the starting parameters. The goodness of the fits was compared using the overall norm of the residuals (see Table 1).TABLE 1Comparison of fitting results using different modelsModelResnorm (×106)μ1/σ1 (counts)μ2/σ2 (counts)μ3/σ3 (counts)μ4/σ4 (counts)μ5/σ5 (counts)Data setWeights of Gaussians describing different numbers of active mGFPs per Orai1 pore123452-Gaussian26.10212/78515/14110.050.9520.080.9230.980.023-Gaussian5.89162/44257/68523/13310.000.080.9220.000.120.8830.380.600.014-Gaussian1.12156/38241/69412/96587/9210.000.090.320.5920.000.080.470.4530.270.700.04−0.015-Gaussian0.40157/40248/63389/62499/142597/6310.000.070.010.720.2020.000.070.030.860.0430.330.630.030.010.00 Open table in a new tab We used a nonparametric statistical test to estimate p values for the tetramer and dimer model (29Wieser S. Axmann M. Schütz G.J. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5988-6001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For this, we took the fit parameters determined for the three data sets as basis for a Monte Carlo simulation of the brightness distributions, assuming either a dimer or a tetramer model. The simulation results were compared with the original data by a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test. This algorithm was repeated 50 times. In an attempt to approach the dimer-to-tetramer transition of Orai1, which might occur in response to store depletion, we initially generated a covalently linked Orai1 homodimer and followed a potential alteration of FRET between CFP/YFP-labeled dimers upon stimulation of their coupling to STIM1 by thapsigargin. These tagged Orai1-homodimers, when co-expressed in HEK-293 cells together with STIM1, were functionally active as evaluated in electrophysiological experiments; experiments on the Orai1 homodimers or on their monomeric form led to the same store-operated current activation (Fig. 1, A and B). FRET as an indicator for association between Orai1 homodimers amounted already to robust values of 0.26 ± 0.04 (n = 6) at the resting state of the cell, which did not significantly change upon store depletion by thapsigargin (Fig. 1, C and D). Similar FRET values were also observed in the absence of coexpressed STIM1 (0.24 ± 0.03, n = 7, Fig. 1D, supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these experiments, a tetrameric state of Orai1 independent of the association with STIM1 seemed more likely than a dimeric resting state assembly. To assess the stoichiometry more directly, we established single molecule microscopy on mobile Orai1 proteins expressed in living mammalian cells. For this, subunits were labeled by fusing them to a monomeric variant of the GFP (Orai1-mGFP, (20Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar)). Because each Orai1 subunit is labeled with exactly one fluorophore, the brightness of a single Orai1-mGFP channel can be used as a direct measure of the number of subunits present in this assembly. For stoichiometry measurements, we used a human bladder carcinoma cell line (T24) as an expression system, which allowed for single molecule resolution with a much better signal to noise ratio than that observed in HEK-293 cells. We used overexpression of mGFP-labeled Orai1 to avoid a potential association with significant amounts of endogenous subunits, which would result in an underestimation of the stoichiometry. The store-dependent function of Orai1-mGFP was confirmed in HEK-293 cells coexpressing STIM1 (supplemental Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows experiments for the characterization of the Orai1 functionality in T24 cells. A possible influence of endogenous STIM1 was assessed by depleting the Ca2+ stores in the ER using BHQ. Store depletion of T24 cells expressing both STIM1 and Orai1 induced strong clustering of the latter within minutes (Fig. 2A), whereas no clustering was observed in cells overexpressing Orai1 alone. We conclude that the massive redistribution of Orai1 preceding store-operated calcium can be induced in the chosen cell system. Electrophysiological experiments in the stable T24-Orai1-mGFP cell line indicated only minor leak current densities under conditions to prevent ER store depletion (100 nm intracellular Ca2+, reversal potential ∼0 mV), which were not significantly different to those of control T24 cells over a time period of 300 s (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the typical Orai1 channel blocker La3+ did not alter basal leak current levels in both cell lines confirming the absence of Orai1 current activation. Thus, based on the lack of Orai1 clustering and current activation, we were fairly safe that under the conditions used for the subsequent stoichiometry experiments, the cells were in a resting state and the Orai1-mGFP channels in a silent state uncoupled from STIM1. We next attempted to address individual Orai1 channels, as they move in the plasma membrane of living T24 cells. In general, however, the high expression level precluded direct imaging of single channels as diffraction-limited spots (see Fig. 2A and Fig. 3C); we estimated a surface density of ∼100–500 channels per μm2. When we totally photobleached a rectangular area (size ∼ 3.5 × 3.3 μm2), the fluorescence signal recovered on a time scale of minutes, yielding a mobile fraction of 91 ± 9% (Fig. 2C, inset), which is in agreement with previously published literature (8Park C.Y. Hoover P.J. Mullins F.M. Bachhawat P. Covington E.D. Raunser S. Walz T. Garcia K.C. Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Cell. 2009; 136: 876-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Tracking of single molecules in living cells is preferentially performed under total internal reflection excitation, so that cytosolic fluorescent background can be substantially reduced (30Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In such a configuration, membrane-anchored fluorescent tracers would recover from the edges of the bleached region, whereas recovery from potential cytosolic populations would emerge uniformly over the whole area. However, at the onset of the recovery process, we frequently observed the sudden appearance of fluorescent spots all over the photobleached region, when we used total internal reflection excitation (supplemental Movie S1). In contrast, the same experiment performed under conventional epi-illumination yielded no detectable single molecule signals at the same recovery time of 100ms (supplemental Movie S2). We conclude that, consistent with previous literature (31Woodard G.E. Salido G.M. Rosado J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1323-C1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), also in T24 cells, a substantial fraction of Orai1-mGFP is located in cytosolic vesicles, which enter the depleted region of interest from the top, i.e. from the cytoplasm; when using standard epi-illumination, vesicles above the field of view are photobleached and thus do not contribute to the obtained postbleached images. In the following, we therefore performed all experiments under conventional epifluorescence excitation. After longer recovery times of 30–90 s, membrane-anchored molecules start to fill the photobleached region by lateral diffusion from the edges (supplemental Movie 3). At these settings, individual Orai1 spots were well resolvable and trackable in the i"

Two fungal iterative polyketide synthases (IPKSs), Rdc5, the highly reducing IPKS, and Rdc1, the nonreducing IPKS, are required for the biosynthesis of radicicol in Pochonia chlamydosporia. In this study, the complete reconstitution of Rdc5 and Rdc1 activities both in vitro and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae uncovered the earliest resorcylic acid lactone intermediate of the radicicol biosynthetic pathway, (R)-monocillin II. The enzymatic synthesis of (R)-monocillin II confirmed the exquisite timing of the Rdc5 enoyl reductase domain. Using precursor-directed biosynthesis, the chemical modularity of the dual IPKS system was determined. Rdc1 readily accepted an N-acetylcysteamine thioester mimic of the reduced pentaketide product of Rdc5 to synthesize (R)-monocillin II with four additional iterations of polyketide elongation, indicating the C2′ ketone group found in (R)-monocillin II is incorporated via the functions of Rdc1 instead of Rdc5. The involvement of the thioesterase domain in Rdc1 in macrolactonization was confirmed through both site-directed mutagenesis and domain deletion. The Rdc1 thioesterase domain was also shown to be tolerant of the opposite stereochemistry of the terminal hydroxyl nucleophile, demonstrated in the precursor-directed synthesis of the enantiomeric (S)-monocillin II.

Polyketides of fungal origin represent an important family of natural products that display a wide range of biological activities (1.Hoffmeister D. Keller N.P. Nat. Prod.

One structurally distinct group of fungal polyketides is the resorcylic acid lactones (RALs) 4The abbreviations used are: RALresorcylic acid lactoneIPKSiterative polyketide synthaseHRPKShighly reducing PKSNRPKSnonreducing PKSDHdehydrataseKRketoreductaseSNACN-acetylcysteamine thioesterACPacyl carrier proteinTEthioesteraseSATstarter unit:ACP transacylaseKSketosynthase.

Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A well known RAL is radicicol (1) (Fig. 1), which is a nanomolar (IC50 = 20 nm) inhibitor of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (5.Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D.

Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hsp90 chaperones the maturation of a wide range of oncogenic proteins (7.Workman P. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and is therefore an attractive target for anticancer drug development. Radicicol inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp90 via competitive binding to the ADP/ATP binding pocket, leading to the inactivation of Hsp90 chaperoning ability (8.Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Despite the highly potent activity, radicicol has not been developed as a drug due to its poor activity in vivo. Radicicol can be readily inactivated through attack at the strained C7′–C8′ epoxide, as well as facile Michael addition at C6′ facilitated by the conjugated dienone (9.Agatsuma T. Ogawa H. Akasaka K.

To overcome these limitations, chemically derived radicicol analogs that do not contain these labile moieties have been pursued (10.Yang Z.Q. Geng X. Solit D. Pratilas C.A. Rosen N. Danishefsky S.J.

These promising results suggest that the radicicol-based RAL scaffold remains an attractive starting point for development of Hsp90 inhibitors, and this prompted us to examine the biosynthesis of the compound in detail. resorcylic acid lactone iterative polyketide synthase highly reducing PKS nonreducing PKS dehydratase ketoreductase N-acetylcysteamine thioester acyl carrier protein thioesterase starter unit:ACP transacylase ketosynthase. Like other RALs studied to date, such as hypothemycin (2) (16.Reeves C.D. Hu Z. Reid R. Kealey J.T. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 2006; 72: 1793-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the carbon scaffold of radicicol is synthesized by the collaborative functions of two type I iterative polyketide synthases (IPKSs). IPKSs are megasynthases in which linearly juxtaposed catalytic domains function in an iterative and a highly programmed fashion (20.Cox R.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2007; 5: 2010-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Genetic knock-out experiments with two different radicicol-producing fungi, Pochonia chlamydosporia and Chaetomium chiversii (16.Reeves C.D. Hu Z. Reid R. Kealey J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.Wang S. Xu Y. Maine E.A. Wijeratne E.M. Espinosa-Artiles P. Gunatilaka A.A. Molnár I. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 1328-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), confirmed that a highly reducing PKS (HRPKS) and a nonreducing PKS (NRPKS) are required for the biosynthesis of radicicol. The domain structures and putative functions of the two P. chlamydosporia PKSs are shown in Fig. 1B. The HRPKS Rdc5 contains the following domains: ketosynthase (KS) that performs the decarboxylative condensation; malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase that selects the building block malonyl-CoA; and acyl carrier protein (ACP) that serves as the tether of the growing polyketide via its phosphopantetheinyl arm. It also has the complete ensemble of β-keto reductive domains, which include ketoreductase (KR); dehydratase (DH); and enoyl reductase (ER). A core domain is located between DH and ER domains, which is proposed to be composed of a pseudo methyltransferase and a structural KR domain (16.Reeves C.D. Hu Z. Reid R. Kealey J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20.Cox R.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2007; 5: 2010-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Via iterative condensation and different combinations of β-keto reduction, Rdc5 is proposed to synthesize the reduced portion of the radicicol scaffold. In place of the reductive domains, the NRPKS Rdc1 contains an N-terminal starter unit:ACP transacylase (SAT) (22.Crawford J.M. Dancy B.C. Hill E.A. Udwary D.W. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16728-16733Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) that transfers the completed reduced polyketide from Rdc5 to Rdc1, a product template (PT) domain (23.Crawford J.M. Thomas P.M. Scheerer J.R. Vagstad A.L. Kelleher N.L. Townsend C.A. Science. 2008; 320: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) putatively involved in the cyclization of the completed nonaketide to yield the resorcylate core, and a C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain (24.Korman T.P. Crawford J.M. Labonte J.W. Newman A.G. Wong J. Townsend C.A. Tsai S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6246-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that performs the macrolactonization to release the RAL product (Fig. 1B) (25.Wang M. Zhou H. Wirz M. Tang Y. Boddy C.N. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6288-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the assignment of Rdc5 and Rdc1 to synthesize the two chemically distinct portions of radicicol parallels the “bi-module” strategy employed by the hypothemycin (2) (16.Reeves C.D. Hu Z. Reid R. Kealey J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and zearalenone (4) (18.Kim Y.T. Lee Y.R. Jin J. Han K.H. Kim H. Kim J.C. Lee T. Yun S.H. Lee Y.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19.Gaffoor I. Trail F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 1793-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) biosynthetic pathways, the proposed rdc pathway shown in Fig. 1B contains several unique features not present in other RAL pathways. Four of these intriguing mechanisms, which are highlighted in Fig. 1B in shaded boxes, in turn lead to unique structural features of radicicol as follows. Structural feature I is the C2′–C6′ dienone. The three-dimensional structure of radicicol is largely determined by the trans-cis-dienone moiety and the adjacent C7′–C8′ epoxide (26.Moulin E. Zoete V. Barluenga S. Karplus M. Winssinger N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6999-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because the epoxide is probably produced by oxidation of a double bond, it is possible that the reduced portion of the radicicol frame may be derived from a trienone. This would then suggest that the ER domain in Rdc5 may not be active during the iterative process and may instead serve as a C5′–C6′ isomerase. Alternatively, the ER may function once at the tetraketide stage (Fig. 1B, box I) to afford the C5′–C6′ single bond and lead to the synthesis of (R)-monocillin II (6) as a possible intermediate to radicicol, which is then desaturated during post-PKS modifications to afford the trienone. Structural feature II is the C2′ ketone. This is a unique structural feature of radicicol compared with other RALs, which has been explored as a reactive handle for oxime formation (11.Ikuina Y. Amishiro N. Miyata M. Narumi H. Ogawa H. Akiyama T. Shiotsu Y. Akinaga S. Murakata C. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2534-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14.Barluenga S. Fontaine J.G. Wang C. Aouadi K. Chen R. Beebe K. Neckers L. Winssinger N. ChemBioChem. 2009; 10: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two possible pathways leading to the installation of the C2′ ketone of radicicol have been proposed (Fig. 1B, box II). In the first case, the ketone is synthesized by Rdc5 in the form of a β-keto group in a hexaketide intermediate, which is elongated by Rdc1 by three additional ketides (6 + 3 combination). This distribution of ketides between the two IPKSs is identical to that of some other RALs (17.Zhou H. Qiao K. Gao Z. Meehan M.J. Li J.W. Zhao X. Dorrestein P.C. Vederas J.C. Tang Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19.Gaffoor I. Trail F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 1793-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28.Zhou H. Zhan J. Watanabe K. Xie X. Tang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6249-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Rdc5 could synthesize a pentaketide, which is transferred by the SAT domain to Rdc1 followed by chain extension of four additional ketides (5 + 4 combination) to complete the nonaketide. The C2′ ketone would be synthesized by Rdc1 in this case. Structural feature III is the C10′ (R)-OH. The R-stereochemistry of the ester-forming, terminal hydroxyl group in radicicol differs from the S configuration present in hypothemycin (2) or zearalenone (4). Although the difference in stereochemistry between these structurally related RALs is most likely the result of the stereospecific β-keto reduction by the KR domain, it remains unknown if the macrolactonizing TE domain of Rdc1 has evolved to be stereoselective toward the terminal (R)-hydroxyl group (Fig. 1B, box III). Structural feature IV is C6-chlorination. One of the key tailoring steps in radicicol biosynthesis is chlorination of the resorcylate core by a putative chlorinase Rdc2 (Fig. 1B, box IV). Knock-out of the Rdc2 homolog (RadH) in C. chiversii resulted in the accumulation of the nonhalogenated version of radicicol, monocillin I (21.Wang S. Xu Y. Maine E.A. Wijeratne E.M. Espinosa-Artiles P. Gunatilaka A.A. Molnár I. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 1328-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rdc2 shares sequence homology to a variety of FAD-dependent halogenases found in bacteria (29.Neumann C.S. Fujimori D.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), fungi (21.Wang S. Xu Y. Maine E.A. Wijeratne E.M. Espinosa-Artiles P. Gunatilaka A.A. Molnár I. Chem.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5798-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Structure-activity relationship studies have revealed that the chlorine contributes to the potent activity of radicicol (32.Barluenga S. Fontaine J.G. Wang C. Aouadi K. Chen R. Beebe K. Neckers L. Winssinger N. ChemBioChem. 2009; 10: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The presence of halide may attenuate the electron density on the aromatic ring and stabilize the compound. The chlorination step has been proposed to take place immediately following the carbon scaffold synthesis; however, the function of Rdc2 has not been verified. Understanding the substrate specificity of Rdc2 may therefore lead to the synthesis of other chlorinated RALs. During the review of this study, an independent study verified the role of Rdc2 as the C6-chlorinase, which is also discussed here (33.Zeng J. Zhan J. ChemBioChem. 2010; 11: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Comprehensive understanding of these highlighted steps of the rdc pathway is therefore an important goal toward the synthesis of radicicol analogs. In this study, we express Rdc5 and Rdc1 using an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain and completely reconstitute the activities of the two IPKSs to demonstrate that (R)-monocillin II (6) is the initial IPKS product. Using a combination of heterologous pathway reconstitution, precursor-directed biosynthesis, and domain dissection, we provide insights into the unique functions of enzymes in the rdc pathway. P. chlamydosporia ATCC 16683 (previously Verticillium chlamydosporium var. catenulatum) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. P. chlamydosporia genomic DNA was prepared using the ZYMO (Orange, CA) ZR fungal/bacterial DNA kit according to the supplied protocols. Total RNA was isolated from P. chlamydosporia using ZYMO ZR Fungal/Bacterial RNA MiniPrep™ kit. The ImProm-II™ reverse transcription system kit was used for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The gene-specific primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) were used for cloning. DNA restriction enzymes were used as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). PCR was performed using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Sequences of PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Laragen, CA). E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used for protein expression. S. cerevisiae strain BJ5464-NpgA (MATα ura3-52 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1 pep4::HIS3 prb1 Δ1.6R can1 GAL) was used as expression host (34.Lee K.K. Da Silva N.A. Kealey J.T. Anal.

The synthetic strategies and procedures for (2E,6E,9R)-9-hydroxydeca-2,6-dienoyl-N-acetylcysteamine (7) and (2E,6E,9S)-9-hydroxydeca-2,6-dienoyl-N-acetylcysteamine (9) and standards are described in detail in the supplemental material. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on Varian Inova 500 MHz, 500 MHz (cold probe), 600 and 700 MHz (cryoprobe) instruments, and a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts/million (ppm) using the residual proton resonance of solvents as reference: CDCl3 δ 7.26, CD3OD δ 3.30, and CD3COCD3 δ 2.04. 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported relative to CDCl3 δ 77.0, CD3OD δ 49.0, and CD3COCD3 δ 29.9. LC-MS was conducted with a Shimadzu 2010 EV liquid chromatography mass spectrometer by using both positive and negative electrospray ionization and a Phenomenex Luna 5 μm 2.0 × 100 mm C18 reverse phase column. Samples were separated on a linear gradient of 5–95% CH3CN (v/v) in H2O supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) formic acid at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Chiral HPLC analysis was performed using a Lux 3 μm cellulose-1 column (4.60 × 250 mm, Phenomenex) with an isocratic condition of 25% isopropyl alcohol in n-hexane (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Genomic DNA from P. chlamydosporia was used as the template for PCR amplifications. The two exons of the rdc5 gene were amplified and ligated into the 2-μ-based yeast-E. coli shuttle vector YEpADH2p with URA3 marker to give pKJ61. The gene encoding Rdc1 was amplified and ligated into YEpADH2p with TRP1 marker to give pKJ91. An engineered FLAG tag expression vector was constructed by introducing DNA sequence 5′-CATATGGCTAGCGATTATAAGGATGATGATGATAAGACTAGTC-3′ into YEpADH2p with URA3 marker between the NdeI and SpeI sites. Both rdc5 and rdc1 genes were then amplified using primers pairs P7/P8 and P9/P10. The genes were digested by SpeI and SwaI and ligated into the FLAG tag expression vector to yield pZH223 and pZH232. Rdc1ΔTE gene was amplified by primer pair P1 and P11. The PCR product was ligated into YEpADH2p with TRP1 marker to give pZH228. The Ser-1889 to Ala mutation was introduced into pKJ91 by primer pair P12 and P13 to give pZH252 for Rdc1_S1889A. Total RNA was isolated from P. chlamydosporia grown for 3 days on potato dextrose agar plate. P14 was used as a primer for RT-PCR to amplify rdc2 cDNA, and P14 paired with P15 were used for regular PCR later. The sequenced rdc2 gene from RT-PCR showed variation compared with the predicted rdc2 CDS (HQ149729) (supplemental Fig. S4). The intron-free rdc2 was ligated into pET24a vector to give E. coli expression plasmid pZH200 or into YEpADH2p with LEU2 marker to yield pZH208. All the plasmids in this work are listed in supplemental Table S2. C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Rdc1ΔTE and Rdc1_S1889A were expressed and purified from S. cerevisiae strain BJ5464-NpgA harboring plasmid pZH228 and pZH252, respectively. C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Rdc2 was expressed and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) strain harboring pZH200 (see supplemental material). N-terminal FLAG-tagged Rdc1 and Rdc5 were expressed and purified from S. cerevisiae strain BJ5464-NpgA harboring plasmid pZH232 and pZH223, respectively. For 1 liter of yeast culture, the cells were grown at 25 °C in YPD media with 1% dextrose for 72 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (3500 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and lysed by sonication on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was loaded onto a gravity flow column containing 3 ml of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin and washed with 10 column volumes of TBS Buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Purified proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of TBS Buffer with 100 mg/ml FLAG peptide. Purified proteins were concentrated and buffer exchanged into Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) + 10% glycerol, concentrated, aliquoted, and flash-frozen. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad). For in vitro assays, 10 μm of Rdc1 and 10 μm of Rdc5 were incubated with 2 mm of NADPH and malonyl-CoA. In the assays for Rdc1, the chemically synthesized starter units were added to 2 mm final concentration. For halogenation assays with Rdc2, 1 mm RAL substrate was incubated with 50 μm Rdc2, 10 μm SsuE, 100 μm FAD, 2 mm NADPH, and 50 mm NaCl. SsuE was used as a FAD reductase, which is cloned and expressed as reported (36.Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26639-26646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All the reactions were quenched and extracted twice with 99% ethyl acetate, 1% acetic acid. The resultant organic extracts were evaporated to dryness, re-dissolved in methanol, and then analyzed by LC-MS. To purify 6 for structural analysis, S. cerevisiae harboring pKJ61 and pKJ91 plasmids was cultured in YPD liquid media (4 liters) for 4 days. The pH of culture supernatant was adjusted to 5.0 and then extracted three times with an equal volume of EtOAc. The resultant organic extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness, redissolved in methanol, and purified by reverse phase HPLC (XTerra Prep MS C18 5 μm, 19 × 50 mm) on a linear gradient of 5–95% CH3CN (v/v) over 15 min and 95% CH3CN (v/v) further for 15 min in H2O supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The eluent was extracted with EtOAc and dried in vacuo to give pure solid 6 (approximate yield of 15 mg/liter). To purify 8, S. cerevisiae/pKJ61 + pZH228 was cultured in YPD (20 liters) media for 4 days followed by the same purification steps as above. To produce 10, S. cerevisiae strain harboring pKJ91 were cultured in YPD media (400 ml) for 2 days. The cell culture was supplemented with 100 mg/liter (2E,6E,9S)-9-hydroxydeca-2,6-dienoyl-N-acetylcysteamine (9) and continued growing for another day. Compound 10 was purified as described above for 6 with an approximate yield of 1.3 mg/liter. S. cerevisiae/pKJ61 + pKJ91 + pZH208 was cultured in YPD media (4 liters) for 4 days, and 11 was purified to a final yield of 14.3 mg/liter. S. cerevisiae strain harboring pZH78 + pZH74 + pZH208 plasmids was cultured in YPD media (4 liters) for 7 days, and 14 was purified to a final yield of 9 mg/liter. Although the rdc gene cluster has been genetically verified in two different fungal hosts, the biochemical characterization of the key IPKSs has not been performed, and the earliest RAL intermediate has not been conclusively identified. As a starting point to study the unique features of the rdc pathway, we aimed to reconstitute the functions of Rdc5 and Rdc1 in vitro and in the heterologous host S. cerevisiae. To do so, yeast 2-μ expression plasmids encoding Rdc1 and Rdc5 under the ADH2 promoter were separately transformed into S. cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA. The use of this vacuolar protease-deficient yeast strain with genome-integrated NpgA (37.Mootz H.D. Schörgendorfer K. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 213: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar) enables heterologous expression of intact and phosphopantetheinylated PKSs (34.Lee K.K. Da Silva N.A. Kealey J.T. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 394: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both megasynthases were solubly expressed and were each purified to single band purity by using anti-FLAG affinity chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). When the purified Rdc5 and Rdc1 were incubated with 2 mm malonyl-CoA and NADPH, a major compound emerged with a mass of 316, which is identical to that of 6. The UV absorbance of the compound is characteristic of resorcylate chromophore with λmax at 217, 260, and 301 nm. To determine the structure of this RAL product, two plasmids harboring rdc1 and rdc5 with different auxotrophic selection markers were co-transformed into S. cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA. After 3 days of culturing in YPD media, both the culture broth and cell pellet were extracted with organic solvent and analyzed with LC-MS. Compared with BJ5464-NpgA expressing either Rdc1 or Rdc5 individually, the co-expression strain synthesized the identical m/z 316 compound as a predominant product at a titer of 15 mg/liter (Fig. 2). The new compound was then purified and analyzed by extensive NMR characterization. The 13C spectrum showed 18 carbon signals, indicative of a nonaketide backbone. One carbon signal at δ 196.5 ppm suggested the existence of an aliphatic ketone. Combining all spectroscopic information, we assigned the structure of this RAL as that of 6 (supplemental Table S3), which has been isolated from different radicicol-producing strains (21.Wang S.

Mycol. Res. 2009; 113: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To confirm the structure of 6 and especially to verify the R-stereochemistry of the lactone at C1, an authentic standard of 6 was chemically synthesized (supplemental Table S4). The UV pattern, retention time on chiral column, and all NMR data of 6 are all identical to that of the standard. The enzymatic synthesis of 6 by purified Rdc1 and Rdc5 conclusively indicates 6 is the first RAL compound in the rdc pathway and is the product directly offloaded from Rdc1 as shown in Fig. 1B. Interestingly, a fully reduced ketide unit at C5′–C6′ is found in 6 instead of the possible trienone structure, which indicates that the ER domain in Rdc5 is indeed functional and can completely reduce the β-keto of the tetraketide to a methylene following the actions of KR and DH. However, the ER domain is not active during the other reductive tailoring iterations, thereby giving rise to the enone at C2′–C4′ and the trans double bond at C7′–C8′ that eventually becomes epoxidized. The additional C5′–C6′ cis double bond present in radicicol must therefore be introduced by post-PKS processing. This is consistent with the genetic studies with C. chiversii, which suggested that C7′–C8′ epoxidation and C5′ hydroxylation may be catalyzed by a single P450 Rdc4 (RadP), although this has not been biochemically confirmed (21.Wang S.

https://openalex.org/W2112315287,"Proteases are a ubiquitous group of enzymes that play key roles in the life cycle of parasites, in the host-parasite relationship, and in the pathogenesis of parasitic diseases. Furthermore, proteases are targets for the development of new anti-parasitic therapy. Protozoan parasites like Leishmania predominantly express Clan CA cysteine proteases for key life cycle functions. It was therefore unexpected to find a high level of serine protease activity expressed by Leishmania donovani. Purification of this activity followed by mass spectrometry identified oligopeptidase B (OPB; Clan SC, family S9A) as the responsible enzyme. This was confirmed by gene knock-out of OPB, which resulted in the disappearance of the detected serine protease activity of Leishmania extracts. To delineate the specific role of OPB in parasite physiology, proteomic analysis was carried out on OPB(-/-) versus wild type parasites. Four protein species were significantly elevated in OPB(-/-) parasites, and all four were identified by mass spectrometry as enolase. This increased enolase was enzymatically inactive and associated with the parasite membrane. Aside from its classic role in carbohydrate metabolism, enolase was recently found to localize to membranes, where it binds host plasminogen and functions as a virulence factor for several pathogens. As expected, there was a striking alteration in macrophage responses to Leishmania when OPB was deleted. Whereas wild type parasites elicited little, if any, response from infected macrophages, OPB(-/-) parasites induced a massive up-regulation in gene transcription. Additionally, these OPB(-/-) parasites displayed decreased virulence in the murine footpad infection model."
https://openalex.org/W2078404121,"Chromosomal translocations targeting the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene result in MLL fusion proteins that are found in aggressive human acute leukemias. Disruption of MLL by such translocations leads to overexpression of Hox genes, resulting in a blockage of hematopoietic differentiation that ultimately leads to leukemia. Menin, which directly binds MLL, has been identified as an essential oncogenic co-factor required for the leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins. Here, we characterize the molecular basis of the MLL-menin interaction. Using (13)C-detected NMR experiments, we have mapped the residues within the intrinsically unstructured fragment of MLL that are required for binding to menin. Interestingly, we found that MLL interacts with menin with a nanomolar affinity (K(d) ∼ 10 nM) through two motifs, MBM1 and MBM2 (menin binding motifs 1 and 2). These motifs are located within the N-terminal 43-amino acid fragment of MLL, and the MBM1 represents a high affinity binding motif. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis of MBM1, we found that the hydrophobic residues Phe(9), Pro(10), and Pro(13) are most critical for binding. Furthermore, based on exchange-transferred nuclear Overhauser effect measurements, we established that MBM1 binds to menin in an extended conformation. In a series of competition experiments we showed that a peptide corresponding to MBM1 efficiently dissociates the menin-MLL complex. Altogether, our work establishes the molecular basis of the menin interaction with MLL and MLL fusion proteins and provides the necessary foundation for development of small molecule inhibitors targeting this interaction in leukemias with MLL translocations."

The Hsp90 and p23 molecular chaperones have been shown to associate with hTERT for the assembly of active telomerase. Here, we show that CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) physically associates with hTERT in the cytoplasm and regulates the cellular abundance of hTERT through a ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

One factor controlling the level of adiposity is the differentiation of cells into adipocytes.

IntroductionIn developed countries, obesity is a significant health problem that is becoming more prevalent. The increase in adiposity, or the percentage of total body mass comprised of lipid stores, correlates with the development of a variety of disorders including, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (1Janssen I. Katzmarzyk P.T. Ross R. Arch. Intern. Med. 2002; 162: 2074-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that in addition to being an energy storage depot, adipose tissue may contribute to disease by producing adipokines, chemokines, and other bioactive substances (2Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3610) Google Scholar). The level of adiposity is regulated by the amount of lipid taken into individual adipocytes and the number of adipocytes in the body. Adipocyte number is regulated by the differentiation of cells into adipocytes, and understanding this process is important for identifying novel methods for controlling obesity.Adipocyte differentiation requires expression of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) 2The abbreviations used are: PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor15d-PGJ(2)15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin (PG) J2PGprostaglandinCOXcyclooxygenase-2BisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolA-FABPadipocyte fatty acid-binding proteinpref-1preadipocyte factor-1C/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1LPLlipoprotein lipase. γ (3Rosen E.D.

When activated by its ligand, PPARγ functions as a transcription factor to induce numerous genes involved in adipogenesis. Identification of the endogenous ligand for PPARγ has been controversial, but treatment with the prostanoid 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin (PG) J2 (15d-PGJ2) has long been known to activate PPARγ and induce adipocyte differentiation following exogenous addition (5Forman B.M.

Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 is derived from nonenzymatic conversion of PGJ2, which in turn is formed from nonenzymatic dehydration of PGD2 (7Scher J.U. Pillinger M.H. Clin. Immunol. 2005; 114: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Shibata T. Kondo M. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10459-10466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PGD2 is formed by PGD2 synthases utilizing the substrate PGH2, which is synthesized by the prostaglandin G/H synthases, also known as cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 (9Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). PGD2 synthase expression has been shown to increase with the differentiation of adipocytes in vitro, and disruption of expression of the synthase limits the complete differentiation of these cells (10Fujimori K. Aritake K. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18458-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).There have been conflicting reports as to the significance of endogenous production of 15d-PGJ2 during adipocyte differentiation in vitro. One report has shown that despite an increase in COX-2 expression, the levels of 15d-PGJ2 detected in the medium of adipocyte cultures are not altered during differentiation (11Bell-Parikh L.C. Ide T. Lawson J.A. McNamara P. Reilly M. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In contrast, another report examining this same cell type does show an increase in 15d-PGJ2 production during differentiation, and this increase in 15d-PGJ2 is attenuated by COX inhibition (12Mazid M.A. Chowdhury A.A. Nagao K. Nishimura K. Jisaka M. Nagaya T. Yokota K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6885-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this report shows that COX inhibition reduces expression of adipocyte-specific genes, an effect that is reversed by the addition of exogenous 15d-PGJ2 (12Mazid M.A. Chowdhury A.A. Nagao K. Nishimura K. Jisaka M. Nagaya T. Yokota K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6885-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Administration of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib has also been shown to reduce adipose tissue mass development in mice without affecting the amount of diet consumed, although the PG responsible for these effects is not known (13Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Lu H.R. Gallacher D.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recently, COX-2 has been shown to contribute to the differentiation of brown adipocytes in mice, following cold or adrenergic stimulation (14Madsen L. Pedersen L.M. Lillefosse H.H. Fjaere E.

The current study utilized mice of different ages that were deficient in COX-2 to examine the role of COX-2-derived PGs as modulators of adipocyte differentiation in white adipose tissue.DISCUSSIONOur current report shows that in aged mice a significant reduction in total body mass and adiposity resulted from the deficiency of COX-2. The reduced adiposity in COX-2-deficient mice occurred without a reduction in food intake and was associated with increased metabolic activity as determined by oxygen consumption. These findings suggest that prostanoid synthesis dependent on the activity of COX-2 is important for in vivo regulation of adipose tissue levels. Although COX-2 is responsible for production of a variety of different prostanoids, those which have been shown to produce the greatest effects on adipocytes are the J-series PGs. Of the J-series PGs, 15d-PGJ2 is the most potent inducer of adipocyte differentiation in vitro, where exogenous addition to the culture converts fibroblasts into adipocytes (5Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar, 6Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 is formed from the spontaneous dehydration of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin PGJ2, which in turn is formed by nonenzymatic dehydration of PGD2 (31Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGD2 formation requires the activity of a PGD2 synthase utilizing PGH2, which is produced by the COX enzymes (9Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). Our current findings show that adipose tissue isolated from COX-2-deficient mice produced significantly lower levels of both PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2. However, PGD2 has been shown to not affect adipocyte differentiation at physiologic concentrations (32Casimir D.A. Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduced adiposity that we observe in COX-2-deficient mice may result from reduced adipocyte differentiation as a consequence of attenuated formation of 15d-PGJ2.A well described mechanism for the adipogenic effects of 15d-PGJ2 results from its activity as a ligand of PPARγ (5Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar, 6Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). Ligand activation of PPARγ induces the expression of genes characteristic of the adipocyte phenotype. A-FABP expression is increased by PPARγ ligand-induced maturation of adipocytes and is a well characterized marker of fully differentiated adipocytes (29Aubert J. Saint-Marc P. Belmonte N. Dani C. Négrel R. Ailhaud G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 160: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we compared the expression of A-FABP in epididymal adipose tissue from wild-type and COX-2-deficient mice. The expression level of A-FABP was significantly lower in adipose tissue from COX-2-deficient, as compared with wild-type controls. Although traditionally considered to function as a cytosolic protein, cultured adipocytes secrete significant levels of A-FABP into the medium (23Xu A. Wang Y. Xu J.Y. Stejskal D. Tam S. Zhang J. Wat N.M. Wong W.K. Lam K.S. Clin. Chem. 2006; 52: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also compared the levels of A-FABP in culture medium from explanted epididymal tissue of wild-type and COX-2-deficient mice. Adipose tissue that was deficient in COX-2 secreted significantly lower levels of A-FABP than COX-2 expressing tissue. A-FABP that is released from adipose tissue has been shown to be detected in the circulation (23Xu A. Wang Y. Xu J.Y. Stejskal D. Tam S. Zhang J. Wat N.M. Wong W.K. Lam K.S. Clin. Chem. 2006; 52: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Thus, in the current report, we compared serum levels of A-FABP between wild-type and COX-2-deficient mice. There was a significantly greater level of A-FABP in the serum of mice expressing COX-2. These findings suggest that the deficiency of COX-2 significantly attenuates adipose expression and secretion of A-FABP, thereby resulting in reduced levels in the circulation.The expression and activation of PPARγ is a key event in determining the adipocyte phenotype. PPARγ is the only known factor with the capacity to induce the differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes in the absence of forced expression of any other gene (34Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mature adipocytes the inactivation of PPARγ produces a regression of the differentiation process (35Tamori Y. Masugi J. Nishino N. Kasuga M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, increased expression of PPARγ is characteristic of differentiated adipocytes, whereas attenuated expression represents a pre-adipocyte phenotype. In the current report, we compared the levels of adipose tissue expression of PPARγ between COX-2 expressing and COX-2-deficient mice. As compared with wild-type controls, PPARγ mRNA expression was significantly attenuated in adipose tissue of COX-2-deficient mice. The expression of LPL is increased by PPARγ ligands and is an early marker of differentiated adipocytes (25Kageyama H. Hirano T. Okada K. Ebara T. Kageyama A. Murakami T. Shioda S. Adachi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, pref-1 expression decreases following adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ ligands are known to down-regulate resistin expression (26Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 27Hartman H.B. Hu X. Tyler K.X. Dalal C.K. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19754-19761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our current findings show that although the deficiency of COX-2 significantly reduces expression of LPL, the expression of pref-1 and resistin are significantly greater in adipose tissue from COX-2-deficient mice. These findings of increased expression of preadipocyte markers and attenuated expression of adipocyte markers further suggest that the deficiency of COX-2 results in attenuated adipose differentiation.In addition to the effects of 15d-PGJ2, other prostanoids may enhance adipocyte differentiation through mechanisms that are independent of PPARγ. The majority of prostanoids produce their biological effects through their respective G-protein-coupled receptors that alter the intracellular levels of cAMP. Of the G-protein-coupled prostanoid receptors, it is primarily the PGI2 receptor that has been shown to promote adipocyte differentiation (28Négrel R. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 383-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PGI2 receptor activation enhances differentiation of cultured preadipocytes, in part by increasing intracellular cAMP levels (36Vassaux G. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Négrel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11092-11097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increased cAMP induces expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which is an early step in the processes leading to adipocyte differentiation (29Aubert J. Saint-Marc P. Belmonte N. Dani C. Négrel R. Ailhaud G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 160: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Our current findings indicate that the deficiency of COX-2 did not affect adipose tissue production of PGI2, as determined by detection of the stable PGI2 metabolite 6-keto-PGF1α. Furthermore, we could identify no significant effect of COX-2 deficiency on mRNA expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Therefore, the reduced adiposity that we observed in COX-2-deficient mice is not associated with attenuated production of PGI2 or altered expression of adipogenic factors known to be induced by this prostanoid.In addition to promoting differentiation, prostanoids have also been shown to inhibit development of the adipocyte phenotype. PGE2 and PGF2α acting through their respective G-protein-coupled receptors have been shown to inhibit adipocyte differentiation, which suggests that reduced adiposity may result from increasing levels of these prostanoids (32Casimir D.A. Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tsuboi H. Sugimoto Y. Kainoh T. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The deficiency of COX-2 has the potential to alter the prostanoids being produced, as the result of a compensatory increase in COX-1 expression, or increased substrate availability for COX-1-dependent prostanoid synthesis (20Wang H. Ma W.G. Tejada L. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Das S.K. Dey S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10649-10658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Kirtikara K. Morham S.G. Raghow R. Laulederkind S.J. Kanekura T. Goorha S. Ballou L.R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Bosetti F. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, in the current report, we examined the effect of COX-2 deficiency on adipose tissue expression of COX-1 mRNA. The deficiency of COX-2 did not significantly affect mRNA expression of COX-1 in adipose tissue. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between wild-type and COX-2-deficient mice in the levels of PGE2 or PGF2α produced by adipose tissue. These findings suggest that the reduced adiposity that we observed in COX-2-deficient mice was not the result of increased COX-1-dependent production of PGE2 or PGF2α.Adipose tissue inflammation is considered a causative factor contributing to the development of a variety of diseases associated with obesity. The severity of adipose tissue inflammation resulting from macrophage infiltration correlates with the level of adiposity in both humans and mice (40Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7312) Google Scholar, 41Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Seo K. Yamashita H. Hosoya Y. Ohsugi M. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Sugiura S. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 710-721PubMed Google Scholar). These previous reports would suggest that our current finding of reduced adiposity in COX-2-deficient mice would be associated with attenuated adipose inflammation. However, 15d-PGJ2 has been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects (42Cuzzocrea S. Wayman N.S. Mazzon E. Dugo L. Di Paola R. Serraino I. Britti D. Chatterjee P.K. Caputi A.P. Thiemermann C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced production of 15d-PGJ2 resulting from COX-2 deficiency could be expected to increase adipose tissue inflammation. Thus, we compared the level of inflammatory markers expressed by adipose tissue from COX-2-deficient and wild-type mice. mRNA expression of the macrophage marker CD68 was significantly reduced in epididymal adipose tissue isolated from COX-2-deficient mice, as compared with wild-type controls. Immunohistochemistry detected abundant expression of Mac-3-positive cells within the adipose tissue of wild-type mice that was absent in COX-2-deficient adipose tissue. mRNA expression of the macrophage chemokine MCP-1 was also significantly reduced in adipose tissue from COX-2-deficient mice. These findings indicate that the attenuated adiposity that occurs in COX-2-deficient mice is associated with reduced macrophage recruitment and infiltration. Furthermore, the reduced adiposity that we observed in mice with attenuated production of 15d-PGJ2 suggests that any potential anti-inflammatory effects of this prostanoid do not significantly influence adipose inflammation.15d-PGJ2 has been shown to be synthesized in mice following induction of an inflammatory response (43Rajakariar R. Hilliard M. Lawrence T. Trivedi S. Colville-Nash P. Bellingan G. Fitzgerald D. Yaqoob M.M. Gilroy D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20979-20984Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similar production of 15d-PGJ2 by inflammatory cells within inflamed adipose tissue would have the potential to enhance adipocyte differentiation. Further studies are required to determine the importance of the influence on adipose inflammation by COX-2 as a potential mechanism in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation.Chronic inhibition of COX-2 has recently been shown to reduce macrophage-dependent adipose tissue inflammation in a rat model of obesity (44Hsieh P.S. Lu K.C. Chiang C.F. Chen C.H. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 40: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). COX-2 inhibition also increases adipose tissue expression of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin in a rat model of chronic inflammation (45Granado M. Martín A.I. Castillero E. López-Calderón A. Villanúa M.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 608: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our current findings show that as compared with wild-type controls, there is a significant increase in adiponectin mRNA expression in adipose tissue of COX-2-deficient mice. Adiponectin expression is known to be suppressed by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα (30Maeda N. Takahashi M. Funahashi T. Kihara S. Nishizawa H. Kishida K. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2094-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). In the current report, TNFα mRNA expression was significantly attenuated in adipose tissue from COX-2-deficient mice. Previous studies have shown that macrophages are responsible for the majority of TNFα produced by adipose tissue of mice (40Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7312) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enhanced gene expression of adiponectin that occurred in COX-2-deficient adipose tissue may result from reduced macrophage-dependent inflammation and attenuated production of TNFα.Aging is associated with an increase in systemic levels of inflammatory mediators, and in mice, aging has been shown to significantly increase the level of adipose tissue inflammation (46Brüünsgaard H. Pedersen B.K. Immunol. Allergy Clin. North Am. 2003; 23: 15-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 47Wu D. Ren Z. Pae M. Guo W. Cui X. Merrill A.H. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4829-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As compared with young mice, the adipose tissue of aged mice expresses a significantly greater level of COX-2 (47Wu D. Ren Z. Pae M. Guo W. Cui X. Merrill A.H. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4829-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our current studies did not identify a significant effect of COX-2 deficiency on body weight of mice at 2, 4, or 6 months of age. However, at 9 months of age, COX-2-deficient mice showed a reduction in total body weight and percent body fat, as compared with the wild-type controls. Furthermore, this effect on adiposity was similarly observed in mice that were either 11 or 12 months of age. Therefore, the contribution of COX-2 to increasing adiposity may primarily occur during the enhanced adipose tissue inflammation that is associated with aging.There are numerous reports of conflicting findings that describe the roles of the individual COX isoforms in regulating adipogenesis. In cultured adipocytes, nonselective COX inhibitors and COX-2-selective inhibitors are reported to decrease adipocyte differentiation, whereas COX-1-selective inhibition has been shown to not alter differentiation (12Mazid M.A. Chowdhury A.A. Nagao K. Nishimura K. Jisaka M. Nagaya T. Yokota K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6885-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 48Fajas L. Miard S. Briggs M.R. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1652-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The inhibition of either COX isoform has also been reported to enhance adipocyte differentiation (49Yan H. Kermouni A. Abdel-Hafez M. Lau D.C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 424-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, studies using antisense to attenuate endogenous COX-2 expression in cultured adipocytes suggest that COX-2 activity produces anti-adipogenic prostanoids, whereas pro-adipogenic prostanoids are derived from the activity of COX-1 (50Chu X. Nishimura K. Jisaka M. Nagaya T. Shono F. Yokota K. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2010; 91: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings conflict with some of the previous adipocyte culture studies that used pharmacological COX inhibition and with our current findings of reduced adiposity in COX-2-deficient mice. The basis for these divergent findings is not clear but may include complications resulting from comparing effects obtained with adipocyte cultures to those obtained from the mixed cell type population found in adipose tissue, particularly during inflammatory states.In contrast to some of the previous reports utilizing adipocyte cultures, our current in vivo findings suggest that COX-2 functions to increase adipose tissue differentiation. Our findings are supported by previous studies also suggesting that COX-2 contributes to increased adiposity in mice. In mice on a high fat and high sugar diet, the deficiency of COX-2 significantly reduces gonadal fat pad weight, although this same report did show increased weight in mice heterozygous for COX-2 (51Fain J.N. Ballou L.R. Bahouth S.W. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 65: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In a separate study of mice on a high-fat diet, chronic administration of the COX-2-selective inhibitor rofecoxib significantly reduces total body weight and adipose tissue weight, without affecting the amount of diet consumed (13Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Lu H.R. Gallacher D.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, these two reports indicate that the effect of COX-2 deficiency or COX-2 inhibition on reducing adiposity is observed after diet-induced weight gain (13Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Lu H.R. Gallacher D.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 51Fain J.N. Ballou L.R. Bahouth S.W. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 65: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our current findings did not identify an effect of COX-2 deficiency in mice at 6 months of age or younger, suggesting that the role of COX-2 in contributing to adiposity may occur primarily during the increase in body weight associated with aging. IntroductionIn developed countries, obesity is a significant health problem that is becoming more prevalent. The increase in adiposity, or the percentage of total body mass comprised of lipid stores, correlates with the development of a variety of disorders including, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (1Janssen I. Katzmarzyk P.T. Ross R. Arch. Intern. Med. 2002; 162: 2074-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that in addition to being an energy storage depot, adipose tissue may contribute to disease by producing adipokines, chemokines, and other bioactive substances (2Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3610) Google Scholar). The level of adiposity is regulated by the amount of lipid taken into individual adipocytes and the number of adipocytes in the body. Adipocyte number is regulated by the differentiation of cells into adipocytes, and understanding this process is important for identifying novel methods for controlling obesity.Adipocyte differentiation requires expression of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) 2The abbreviations used are: PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor15d-PGJ(2)15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin (PG) J2PGprostaglandinCOXcyclooxygenase-2BisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolA-FABPadipocyte fatty acid-binding proteinpref-1preadipocyte factor-1C/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1LPLlipoprotein lipase. γ (3Rosen E.D.

When activated by its ligand, PPARγ functions as a transcription factor to induce numerous genes involved in adipogenesis. Identification of the endogenous ligand for PPARγ has been controversial, but treatment with the prostanoid 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin (PG) J2 (15d-PGJ2) has long been known to activate PPARγ and induce adipocyte differentiation following exogenous addition (5Forman B.M.

Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 is derived from nonenzymatic conversion of PGJ2, which in turn is formed from nonenzymatic dehydration of PGD2 (7Scher J.U. Pillinger M.H. Clin. Immunol. 2005; 114: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Shibata T. Kondo M. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10459-10466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PGD2 is formed by PGD2 synthases utilizing the substrate PGH2, which is synthesized by the prostaglandin G/H synthases, also known as cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 (9Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). PGD2 synthase expression has been shown to increase with the differentiation of adipocytes in vitro, and disruption of expression of the synthase limits the complete differentiation of these cells (10Fujimori K. Aritake K. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18458-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).There have been conflicting reports as to the significance of endogenous production of 15d-PGJ2 during adipocyte differentiation in vitro. One report has shown that despite an increase in COX-2 expression, the levels of 15d-PGJ2 detected in the medium of adipocyte cultures are not altered during differentiation (11Bell-Parikh L.C. Ide T. Lawson J.A. McNamara P. Reilly M. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In contrast, another report examining this same cell type does show an increase in 15d-PGJ2 production during differentiation, and this increase in 15d-PGJ2 is attenuated by COX inhibition (12Mazid M.A. Chowdhury A.A. Nagao K. Nishimura K. Jisaka M. Nagaya T. Yokota K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6885-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this report shows that COX inhibition reduces expression of adipocyte-specific genes, an effect that is reversed by the addition of exogenous 15d-PGJ2 (12Mazid M.A. Chowdhury A.A. Nagao K. Nishimura K. Jisaka M. Nagaya T. Yokota K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6885-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Administration of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib has also been shown to reduce adipose tissue mass development in mice without affecting the amount of diet consumed, although the PG responsible for these effects is not known (13Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Lu H.R. Gallacher D.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recently, COX-2 has been shown to contribute to the differentiation of brown adipocytes in mice, following cold or adrenergic stimulation (14Madsen L. Pedersen L.M. Lillefosse H.H. Fjaere E.

The current study utilized mice of different ages that were deficient in COX-2 to examine the role of COX-2-derived PGs as modulators of adipocyte differentiation in white adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1970961537,"NIR (novel INHAT repressor) is a transcriptional co-repressor with inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) activity and has previously been shown to physically interact with and suppress p53 transcriptional activity and function. However, the mechanism by which NIR suppresses p53 is not completely understood. Using a proteomic approach, we have identified the Aurora kinase B as a novel binding partner of NIR. We show that Aurora B, NIR and p53 exist in a protein complex in which Aurora B binds to NIR, thus also indirectly associates with p53. Functionally, overexpression of Aurora B or NIR suppresses p53 transcriptional activity, and depletion of Aurora B or NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest, due to the up-regulation of p21 and Bax. We then demonstrate that Aurora B phosphorylates multiple sites in the p53 DNA-binding domain in vitro, and this phosphorylation probably also occurs in cells. Importantly, the Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation on Ser269 or Thr284 significantly compromises p53 transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results provide novel insight into NIR-mediated p53 suppression and also suggest an additional way for p53 regulation.

IntroductionThe tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that regulates various important biological processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence (1Kruse J.P. Gu W. Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar), and p53 mutations have been identified in over 50% of human cancers (3Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5744) Google Scholar, 4Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of p53 in unstressed cells is low; in response to DNA damage, the stability and activity of p53 is modulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation (5Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 6Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Activated p53 can induce the transcription of subsets of genes. Putative p53 target genes include the p21 and some proapoptotic genes, such as Bax, Puma, and NOXA (2Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 leads to G1 phase cell growth arrest (7el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). At least 20 phosphorylation sites have been reported for human p53; the majority of these sites are modified in response to DNA damage or stress, but some are phosphorylated under normal growth conditions. Most of the N-terminal-specific phosphorylation sites prevent MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and stabilize p53; in contrast, phosphorylation of p53 at its C-terminal and some N-terminal sites more often suppresses its function, in most cases by promoting its degradation, for example phosphorylation of Ser362/366 by inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (12Xia Y.

To date, little is known about phosphorylation in the p53 DBD.NIR (novel INHAT repressor) has been identified as a potent transcriptional co-repressor with inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) activity (14Hublitz P. Kunowska N. Mayer U.P. Müller J.M. Heyne K. Yin N. Fritzsche C. Poli C. Miguet L. Schupp I.W. van Grunsven L.A. Potiers N. van Dorsselaer A. Metzger E. Roemer K. Schüle R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2912-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a nuclear protein, NIR has been shown to directly bind to nucleosomes and core histones and prevent acetylation by histone acetyltransferases. Moreover, NIR also physically interacts with p53 and localizes to the promoter regions of some p53-targeted genes, thus suppressing p53 transcriptional activity and p53-dependent apoptosis (14Hublitz P. Kunowska N. Mayer U.P. Müller J.M. Heyne K. Yin N. Fritzsche C. Poli C. Miguet L. Schupp I.W. van Grunsven L.A. Potiers N. van Dorsselaer A. Metzger E. Roemer K. Schüle R.

Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Aurora B is regulated through autophosphorylation (20Yasui Y. Urano T. Kawajiri A. Nagata K. Tatsuka M.

It is well established that Aurora B is required for chromosome condensation, alignment, and cytokinesis (19Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Aurora B, NIR, and p53 exist in a protein complex in vivo. NIR functions to mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53 within this complex, therefore facilitating Aurora B-mediated p53 phosphorylation on multiple sites in the DBD and thus causes significantly impaired p53 transcriptional activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we aimed to better understand the mechanism underlying NIR-mediated suppression of p53, a key protein already known to interact with NIR. With this in mind, we performed tandem affinity purification using a two-step protocol and identified Aurora B as a novel NIR-interacting protein. We then showed that Aurora B exists in a complex with NIR and p53, in which NIR might mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53 (Fig. 2). In further studies, we provide several lines of evidence that p53 is functionally suppressed in this protein complex. First, overexpression of wild-type Aurora B or NIR suppresses p53 transcriptional activity and the induction of p21 and Bax in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). Second, depletion of Aurora B or NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest through induction of p53 key target genes, such as p21 and Bax (Fig. 3, C and D). Finally, Aurora B-mediated p53 suppression requires its kinase activity (Fig. 4, A and C). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Aurora B is able to directly phosphorylate p53 and that phosphorylation on Ser269 and Thr284 significantly compromised p53 activity (Figs. 4, D–G, and 5, A–D). Based on these results, we propose a model in which, under normal growth conditions and other specific conditions (e.g. in cells with spontaneous DNA damage or in B cells undergoing CSR), p53 is functionally suppressed within the Aurora B-NIR-p53 protein complex, mainly through constitutive phosphorylation within the DBD domain by Aurora B (Fig. 5E).Previous studies indicated that NIR binds to two regions of p53 and suppresses p53 function (14Hublitz P. Kunowska N. Mayer U.P. Müller J.M. Heyne K. Yin N. Fritzsche C. Poli C. Miguet L. Schupp I.W. van Grunsven L.A. Potiers N. van Dorsselaer A. Metzger E. Roemer K. Schüle R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2912-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results showed that NIR binds to the kinase domain of Aurora B and that both the N terminus (amino acids 1–250) and C terminus (amino acids 500–749) of NIR are involved in the interaction with Aurora B. Under normal growth conditions, depletion of NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C, and Fig. 3). We speculate that NIR mainly functions to mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53, leading to constitutive p53 phosphorylation and functional suppression. At present, it is unclear whether NIR play a direct role in regulating Aurora B kinase activity, and due to the poor expression of NIR fusion protein in bacteria, we are currently unable to address this question in in vitro assays.A functional connection between Aurora B and p53 has been documented previously. For example, overexpression of Aurora B kinase has been reported in colorectal (31Katayama H. Ota T. Jisaki F. Ueda Y. Tanaka T. Odashima S. Suzuki F. Terada Y. Tatsuka M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1160-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and prostate cancers (32Lee E.C. Frolov A. Li R. Ayala G. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4996-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and treatment of cells with Aurora B inhibitors induces p53-dependent apoptosis in human leukemia cells (33Ikezoe T. Yang J. Nishioka C. Yokoyama A. Int. J. Hematol. 2010; 91: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Aurora B suppresses p53 through direct phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have identified the Aurora B-mediated p53 phosphorylation sites in vitro and shown that these sites are also most likely phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, all three phosphorylation sites (Ser183, Ser269, Thr284) are located in the p53 DBD domain. Functional assays further defined that phosphorylation on Ser269 and Thr284 plays a major role in this p53-negative regulation (Fig. 5, A–D). Phosphorylation of these sites is unlikely to cause p53 degradation as depletion of Aurora B did not increase endogenous p53 protein levels (Fig. 3C) and the expression levels of WT p53 and its phosphomimetic mutants are similar (Fig. 5D). Previous structural studies indicated that Ser269 and Thr284 are located in the DBD core domain S10 strand and H2 helix region, respectively (34Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 35Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that phosphorylation at these sites affects p53 binding to some specific promoter regions of its target genes. In addition, although phosphorylation mimicking of either Ser269 or Thr284 is sufficient to abolish the induction of p21 and proapoptotic Bax protein (Fig. 5, A–D), it is unclear whether phosphorylation on Ser269 or Thr284 occurs simultaneously in vivo or exhibits some preference under certain conditions.It is noteworthy that, although the expression level of Aurora B protein peaks at the late G2 to M phase (16Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Aurora B is expressed at a basal level throughout the cell cycle (36Stewart S. Fang G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that in most of the cell population, Aurora B levels are comparable with the basal level of p53 and indispensable for p53 phosphorylation and suppression in the absence of DNA damage. Our results indicate that p53-NIR-Aurora B form a protein complex separate from MDM2 (Fig. 2A), and it is possible that upon DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and most “free” p53 can “escape” the suppression within this protein complex. Subsequently, the function of this free p53 is gradually down-regulated, partially through the phosphorylation by Aurora B. In favor of this notion, previous studies have reported slow kinetics of p53 phosphorylation after DNA damage, for example the phosphorylation of Ser366, Ser378, and Thr387 by Chk1/Chk2 (37Ou Y.H. Chung P.H. Sun T.P. Shieh S.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Double-stranded DNA breaks trigger p53-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis pathways. B cells undergoing CSR and somatic hypermutation have physiologic double-stranded DNA breaks, and suppression of p53 function is necessary to allow efficient rearrangement of antigen receptors and generation of neutralizing antibody responses (9Sale J.E. Neuberger M.S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Papavasiliou F.N. Schatz D.G.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 589-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The oncogene BCL6 has been shown to inhibit p53 function by suppressing its expression in germinal center B cells (38Phan R.T. Dalla-Favera R. Nature. 2004; 432: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, significant p53 protein levels can be observed in germinal center B cells (38Phan R.T. Dalla-Favera R. Nature. 2004; 432: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional factors independent of BCL6 may be required for further inhibition of p53 function and B cell terminal differentiation. Because NIR functions to suppress p53 and shows increased expression upon CD40L and IL-4 stimulation in normal B cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), NIR may be such a factor. In support of this, we have shown that NIR forms a complex with Aurora B and facilitates p53 protein phosphorylation and suppression. Additionally, B cells from EDI patients with defects in CSR fail to express NIR upon stimulation (15Jain A. Ma C.A. Lopez-Granados E. Means G. Brady W. Orange J.S. Liu S. Holland S. Derry J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because NIR-deficient mice are embryonic lethal, 3L. Wu, C. A. Ma, and A. Jain, unpublished observations. it will be important to make NIR-conditional knock-out mice and examine whether specific depletion of NIR expression in the B cell lineage impairs germinal center formation and the development of neutralizing antibody responses. IntroductionThe tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that regulates various important biological processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence (1Kruse J.P. Gu W. Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar), and p53 mutations have been identified in over 50% of human cancers (3Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5744) Google Scholar, 4Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of p53 in unstressed cells is low; in response to DNA damage, the stability and activity of p53 is modulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation (5Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 6Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Activated p53 can induce the transcription of subsets of genes. Putative p53 target genes include the p21 and some proapoptotic genes, such as Bax, Puma, and NOXA (2Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 leads to G1 phase cell growth arrest (7el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Suppression of p53 function in the germinal center (GC) is important for high rate B cell proliferation (8MacLennan I.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar).

Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). At least 20 phosphorylation sites have been reported for human p53; the majority of these sites are modified in response to DNA damage or stress, but some are phosphorylated under normal growth conditions. Most of the N-terminal-specific phosphorylation sites prevent MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and stabilize p53; in contrast, phosphorylation of p53 at its C-terminal and some N-terminal sites more often suppresses its function, in most cases by promoting its degradation, for example phosphorylation of Ser362/366 by inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (12Xia Y.

To date, little is known about phosphorylation in the p53 DBD.NIR (novel INHAT repressor) has been identified as a potent transcriptional co-repressor with inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) activity (14Hublitz P.

As a nuclear protein, NIR has been shown to directly bind to nucleosomes and core histones and prevent acetylation by histone acetyltransferases. Moreover, NIR also physically interacts with p53 and localizes to the promoter regions of some p53-targeted genes, thus suppressing p53 transcriptional activity and p53-dependent apoptosis (14Hublitz P.

Second, depletion of Aurora B or NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest through induction of p53 key target genes, such as p21 and Bax (Fig. 3, C and D). Finally, Aurora B-mediated p53 suppression requires its kinase activity (Fig. 4, A and C). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Aurora B is able to directly phosphorylate p53 and that phosphorylation on Ser269 and Thr284 significantly compromised p53 activity (Figs. 4, D–G, and 5, A–D). Based on these results, we propose a model in which, under normal growth conditions and other specific conditions (e.g. in cells with spontaneous DNA damage or in B cells undergoing CSR), p53 is functionally suppressed within the Aurora B-NIR-p53 protein complex, mainly through constitutive phosphorylation within the DBD domain by Aurora B (Fig. 5E).Previous studies indicated that NIR binds to two regions of p53 and suppresses p53 function (14Hublitz P. Kunowska N. Mayer U.P. Müller J.M. Heyne K. Yin N. Fritzsche C. Poli C. Miguet L. Schupp I.W. van Grunsven L.A. Potiers N. van Dorsselaer A. Metzger E. Roemer K. Schüle R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2912-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results showed that NIR binds to the kinase domain of Aurora B and that both the N terminus (amino acids 1–250) and C terminus (amino acids 500–749) of NIR are involved in the interaction with Aurora B. Under normal growth conditions, depletion of NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C, and Fig. 3). We speculate that NIR mainly functions to mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53, leading to constitutive p53 phosphorylation and functional suppression. At present, it is unclear whether NIR play a direct role in regulating Aurora B kinase activity, and due to the poor expression of NIR fusion protein in bacteria, we are currently unable to address this question in in vitro assays.A functional connection between Aurora B and p53 has been documented previously. For example, overexpression of Aurora B kinase has been reported in colorectal (31Katayama H. Ota T. Jisaki F. Ueda Y. Tanaka T. Odashima S. Suzuki F. Terada Y. Tatsuka M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1160-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and prostate cancers (32Lee E.C. Frolov A. Li R. Ayala G. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4996-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and treatment of cells with Aurora B inhibitors induces p53-dependent apoptosis in human leukemia cells (33Ikezoe T. Yang J. Nishioka C. Yokoyama A. Int. J. Hematol. 2010; 91: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Aurora B suppresses p53 through direct phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have identified the Aurora B-mediated p53 phosphorylation sites in vitro and shown that these sites are also most likely phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, all three phosphorylation sites (Ser183, Ser269, Thr284) are located in the p53 DBD domain. Functional assays further defined that phosphorylation on Ser269 and Thr284 plays a major role in this p53-negative regulation (Fig. 5, A–D). Phosphorylation of these sites is unlikely to cause p53 degradation as depletion of Aurora B did not increase endogenous p53 protein levels (Fig. 3C) and the expression levels of WT p53 and its phosphomimetic mutants are similar (Fig. 5D). Previous structural studies indicated that Ser269 and Thr284 are located in the DBD core domain S10 strand and H2 helix region, respectively (34Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 35Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that phosphorylation at these sites affects p53 binding to some specific promoter regions of its target genes. In addition, although phosphorylation mimicking of either Ser269 or Thr284 is sufficient to abolish the induction of p21 and proapoptotic Bax protein (Fig. 5, A–D), it is unclear whether phosphorylation on Ser269 or Thr284 occurs simultaneously in vivo or exhibits some preference under certain conditions.It is noteworthy that, although the expression level of Aurora B protein peaks at the late G2 to M phase (16Bischoff J.R.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Aurora B is expressed at a basal level throughout the cell cycle (36Stewart S. Fang G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that in most of the cell population, Aurora B levels are comparable with the basal level of p53 and indispensable for p53 phosphorylation and suppression in the absence of DNA damage. Our results indicate that p53-NIR-Aurora B form a protein complex separate from MDM2 (Fig. 2A), and it is possible that upon DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and most “free” p53 can “escape” the suppression within this protein complex. Subsequently, the function of this free p53 is gradually down-regulated, partially through the phosphorylation by Aurora B. In favor of this notion, previous studies have reported slow kinetics of p53 phosphorylation after DNA damage, for example the phosphorylation of Ser366, Ser378, and Thr387 by Chk1/Chk2 (37Ou Y.H. Chung P.H. Sun T.P. Shieh S.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Double-stranded DNA breaks trigger p53-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis pathways. B cells undergoing CSR and somatic hypermutation have physiologic double-stranded DNA breaks, and suppression of p53 function is necessary to allow efficient rearrangement of antigen receptors and generation of neutralizing antibody responses (9Sale J.E. Neuberger M.S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Papavasiliou F.N. Schatz D.G.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 589-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The oncogene BCL6 has been shown to inhibit p53 function by suppressing its expression in germinal center B cells (38Phan R.T. Dalla-Favera R. Nature. 2004; 432: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, significant p53 protein levels can be observed in germinal center B cells (38Phan R.T. Dalla-Favera R. Nature. 2004; 432: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional factors independent of BCL6 may be required for further inhibition of p53 function and B cell terminal differentiation. Because NIR functions to suppress p53 and shows increased expression upon CD40L and IL-4 stimulation in normal B cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), NIR may be such a factor. In support of this, we have shown that NIR forms a complex with Aurora B and facilitates p53 protein phosphorylation and suppression. Additionally, B cells from EDI patients with defects in CSR fail to express NIR upon stimulation (15Jain A. Ma C.A. Lopez-Granados E. Means G. Brady W. Orange J.S. Liu S. Holland S. Derry J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because NIR-deficient mice are embryonic lethal, 3L. Wu, C. A. Ma, and A. Jain, unpublished observations. it will be important to make NIR-conditional knock-out mice and examine whether specific depletion of NIR expression in the B cell lineage impairs germinal center formation and the development of neutralizing antibody responses. In this study, we aimed to better understand the mechanism underlying NIR-mediated suppression of p53, a key protein already known to interact with NIR. With this in mind, we performed tandem affinity purification using a two-step protocol and identified Aurora B as a novel NIR-interacting protein. We then showed that Aurora B exists in a complex with NIR and p53, in which NIR might mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53 (Fig. 2). In further studies, we provide several lines of evidence that p53 is functionally suppressed in this protein complex. First, overexpression of wild-type Aurora B or NIR suppresses p53 transcriptional activity and the induction of p21 and Bax in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). Second, depletion of Aurora B or NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest through induction of p53 key target genes, such as p21 and Bax (Fig. 3, C and D). Finally, Aurora B-mediated p53 suppression requires its kinase activity (Fig. 4, A and C).

https://openalex.org/W2011244916,"The MHC is central to the adaptive immune response. The human MHC class II is encoded by three different isotypes, HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP, each being highly polymorphic. In contrast to HLA-DR, the intracellular assembly and trafficking of HLA-DP molecules have not been studied extensively. However, different HLA-DP variants can be either protective or risk factors for infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis B), immune dysfunction (e.g. berylliosis), and autoimmunity (e.g. myasthenia gravis). Here, we establish a system to analyze the chaperone requirements for HLA-DP and to compare the assembly and trafficking of HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR directly. Unlike HLA-DR1, HLA-DQ5 and HLA-DP4 can form SDS-stable dimers supported by invariant chain (Ii) in the absence of HLA-DM. Uniquely, HLA-DP also forms dimers in the presence of HLA-DM alone. In model antigen-presenting cells, SDS-stable HLA-DP complexes are resistant to treatments that prevent formation of SDS-stable HLA-DR complexes.

The unexpected properties of HLA-DP molecules may help explain why they bind to a more restricted range of peptides than other human MHC class II proteins and frequently present viral peptides. MHC class II molecules play an important role in the immune system. They are essential in the defense against infection and are a main consideration in transplantation medicine. In addition to presenting antigenic peptides from predominantly extracellular sources to CD4+ T cells, MHC class II molecules also mediate the thymic selection of helper T cells. MHC class II molecules consist of an α and β chain and are transported to endosomal-lysosomal compartments by the invariant chain (Ii). 2The abbreviations used are: Iiinvariant chainAPCantigen-presenting cellERendoplasmic reticulum. The Ii is degraded until only a small fragment, dubbed CLIP, remains bound in the peptide-binding groove. Lysosomal pH and the class II-like molecule HLA-DM promote the exchange of the CLIP fragment for more stably binding antigenic peptides (1Hiltbold E.M. Roche P.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). invariant chain antigen-presenting cell endoplasmic reticulum. In humans, MHC class II molecules are encoded by three different loci, HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP, which display ∼70% similarity to each other. Polymorphism is a notable feature of MHC class II genes. For HLA-DR, most variability comes from DRB, with >700 known alleles at population level, whereas there are only three DRA variants. In contrast, both chains of HLA-DQ and -DP are polymorphic (2Robinson J. Waller M.J. Fail S.C. McWilliam H. Lopez R. Parham P. Marsh S.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D1013-D1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For HLA-DP, however, only a few alleles are prevalent, most notably the heterodimer DPA1*0103/DPB1*0401 (DP401) (3Castelli F.A. Buhot C. Sanson A. Zarour H. Pouvelle-Moratille S. Nonn C. Gahery-Ségard H. Guillet J.G. Ménez A. Georges B. Maillère B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6928-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Despite the essential function of MHC class II molecules in immune defense against pathogens, some alleles are frequently linked to immune diseases. For example, HLA-DR1 and DR4 predispose for rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus, whereas DR2 confers susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Similarly, DQ2 and DQ8 are linked to celiac disease (4Fernando M.M. Stevens C.R. Walsh E.C. De Jager P.L. Goyette P. Plenge R.M. Vyse T.J. Rioux J.D.

Immunol. 2006; 6: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The role of HLA-DP in immune dysfunction has been less well defined. However, DP0201 is a risk factor for the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis in the Japanese (6Horiki T. Inoko H. Moriuchi J. Ichikawa Y. Arimori S. Autoimmunity. 1994; 19: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and DP alleles with a glutamic acid at position 69 are associated with berylliosis, a hard metal lung disease (7Richeldi L. Sorrentino R. Saltini C. Science. 1993; 262: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Although presentation of intracellular antigens by MHC class II molecules is considered atypical, HLA-DP4 gene products frequently present viral peptides, for example from HIV envelope protein, rabies virus, and hepatitis B virus envelope protein (8Celis E. Larson J. Otvos Jr., L. Wunner W.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 305-310PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hammond S.A. Obah E. Stanhope P. Monell C.R. Strand M. Robbins F.M. Bias W.B. Karr R.W. Koenig S. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1470-1477PubMed Google Scholar). DR1 (DRA, DRB1*0101) was the first MHC class II molecule to be crystallized (10Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar), and HLA-DR is the most intensively studied MHC class II isotype. Efficient peptide presentation by HLA-DR is well recognized to depend on both Ii and DM. Indeed, biochemical studies suggested that HLA-DR alleles that bind inefficiently to the Ii CLIP fragment are more likely to induce an autoimmune response, for example in rheumatoid arthritis (11Patil N.S. Pashine A. Belmares M.P. Liu W. Kaneshiro B. Rabinowitz J. McConnell H. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7157-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Weak affinity of the Ii for DQ has also been associated with juvenile dermatomyositis (12Reed A.M. Collins E.J. Shock L.P. Klapper D.G. Frelinger J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6260-6265PubMed Google Scholar). Structural information has been obtained for some HLA-DQ molecules involved in autoimmune disease; for example, crystal structures of the DQ8-insulin peptide complex (13Lee K.H. Wucherpfennig K.W. Wiley D.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and the DQ2-gluten peptide complex have been solved (14Kim C.Y. Quarsten H. Bergseng E. Khosla C. Sollid L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4175-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Although SDS-stable DQ molecules have been visualized (15Ettinger R.A. Liu A.W. Nepom G.T. Kwok W.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6439-6445PubMed Google Scholar), and Ii supports assembly of the DQ-like H-2A protein in the mouse (16Germain R.N. Hendrix L.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the relative contributions of DM and Ii in the acquisition of stable DQαβ dimers have not been fully explored. The first crystal structure of an HLA-DP protein, HLA-DP2, has been recently published, in complex with a self-peptide from the DPα chain (17Dai S. Murphy G.A. Crawford F. Mack D.G. Falta M.T. Marrack P. Kappler J.W. Fontenot A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7425-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HLA-DP molecules bind a limited set of peptides (18Sidney J. Steen A. Moore C. Ngo S. Chung J. Peters B. Sette A. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 2492-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but the relative lack of molecular and biochemical studies on HLA-DP means that exactly how it acquires peptides is unclear. The organization and expression of the MHC, particularly of DP-like genes, vary greatly among mammals, making comparative study of DP function in model animals difficult. In mice, which lack functional DP paralogs, I-E and I-A are considered the operative homologs of DR and DQ, respectively. Unlike HLA-DQ and DR, HLA-DPB1 sequences from humans, macaques, and great apes group into distinct lineages, suggesting that DP evolution has occurred after speciation (19Bontrop R.E. Otting N. de Groot N.G. Doxiadis G.G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 167: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To overcome the limitations of animal models with respect to HLA-DP biochemistry, we have employed a human cell culture system to compare the assembly and trafficking of DP with DQ and DR directly. Notably, in an identical cellular environment, DR, DQ, and DP have different requirements for Ii and DM. Our results suggest that trafficking and peptide loading of different MHC class II molecules can be modulated by tuning the level of DM and Ii in APCs, and our data have implications for the role of HLA-DP in autoimmune disease. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and human melanoma MelJuso cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium or DMEM (Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm GlutaMAX, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Daudi cells (DPA1*010301, 020101 and DPB1*020102, 0802) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with the above supplements. MelJuso cells were typed by the National Health Service Blood and Transplant Unit (Newcastle, UK) to be homozygous for DPB1*1301. The mAbs 1B5 against DRα and HC10 against MHC class I, and the polyclonal antisera against DRβ, DQ, and DP were a gift from Prof. J. Neefjes (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The polyclonal DP serum predominantly recognizes the DPβ chain and only weakly recognizes the DPα chain when DPαβ are co-expressed. The mAb against the Ii (PIN.1) and mAbs HL40 (anti-DRβ/DPβ), HL37 (anti-DQβ), and KUL/05 (anti-class IIβ) were purchased from Abcam. The anti-DQ mAbs L2 and SPV-L3 were a kind gift from Prof. J. Robinson (Newcastle, UK). The DM constructs have been described previously (20van Lith M. Benham A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5430-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The Ii (short isoform) and DR1 constructs (DRA*0101 and DRB1*010101) were a kind gift of Prof. J. Neefjes (Netherlands Cancer Institute). The DQ and DP constructs in pCMV6 were obtained from Origene: DQA1*010202, DQB1*050101 (DQ5), DPA1*010301, DPB1*040101 (DP4), and DPB1*1701. The HLA-DPB cysteine to alanine mutants (C211A, C15A/C77A) were generated using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections were done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturers ‘ instructions. For Lipofectamine transfection, subconfluent cells in 6-cm dishes were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution and OptiMEM and transfected with 1 μg of DNA for 6 h in the presence of OptiMEM serum-free medium. After 6 h, the cells were washed and placed back in normal growth medium. For FuGENE HD transfections, the transfection mix was added to the medium. The cells were analyzed 24 h after transfection, and expression of all chains was confirmed by Western blotting. Where indicated, cells were incubated with leupeptin (15 μm), NH4Cl (20 mm), or vehicle control 1 h before transfection until lysis. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and were either left untreated, or were incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS to permeabilize the cells. After blocking in 0.2% BSA in PBS, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, washed in 0.2% BSA/PBS, and incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h (Alexa Fluor 488; Invitrogen). The nuclei were stained with DAPI before mounting the coverslips with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken on an Axio imager.M1 with OpenLab software. Cells and transfectants were lysed on ice with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A)). Postnuclear lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma/Amersham Biosciences) and antibodies for 1–2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the beads, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) at 150 mA for 2 h. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline Tween (TBST) with 8% milk, followed by incubation with primary antibody. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO), washed, and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film (Kodak). Protein markers were from Bio-Rad. Lysates were 1:1 diluted with 2 × reducing sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris-HCl- pH 6.8, bromphenol blue, 100 mm DTT). Half of the sample was left at room temperature, and half of the sample was boiled for 5 min, before analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. These experiments were repeated 2–5 times with reproducible results. We and other investigators have shown that different non-APCs can be reconstituted with a functional MHC class II compartment by transfection of HLA-DR molecules, the Ii and DM (20van Lith M. Benham A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5430-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Karlsson L. Péléraux A. Lindstedt R. Liljedahl M. Peterson P.A.

The advantages of this system are that folding, assembly, and trafficking of different MHC class II isotypes can be compared in the same cell line and that the contribution of individual proteins (Ii, DM, and class II αβ chains) can be examined in the absence of competing endogenous proteins. To assess whether the different MHC class II isotypes, HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP would all assemble in non-APCs, we transfected HeLa cells with different combinations of α, β, and Ii constructs. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1B5 (DR), HL37 (DQ), or HL40 (DP). 1B5 efficiently immunoprecipitated the DRα chain (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4) and co-immunoprecipitated DRβ and the Ii (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8 and lane 12, respectively). 1B5 did not aspecifically co-immunoprecipitate the DRβ chain or Ii (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 9, respectively). HL37 directly immunoprecipitated the DQβ chain (Fig. 1B, lane 2) and co-immunoprecipitated DQα and the Ii (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 6, respectively). HL37 did not immunoprecipitate DQα directly (Fig. 1B, lane 1), and association with the Ii was dependent on expression of both DQα and DQβ (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5 and 6). The mAb HL40 directly immunoprecipitated DPβ (Fig. 1C, lane 2) but did not aspecifically immunoprecipitate the Ii (Fig. 1C, lane 4). HL40 co-immunoprecipitated DPα and the Ii from DPαβ/Ii transfectants (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 5). We conclude that HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP could all be effectively reconstituted in HeLa cells. Previous studies have shown that endosomal-lysosomal deposition of HLA-DR is critically dependent on the Ii (23Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To determine whether HLA-DQ and -DP are equally dependent on the Ii for intracellular localization we used immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). HeLa cells were transfected with β chain only, or in combination with the α chain, Ii, or DM. The cells were fixed and either left unpermeabilized (−Tx, to demonstrate cell surface deposition), or were permeabilized (+Tx, to show intracellular distribution) before immunostaining with HL40 (DR and DP) or HL37 (DQ). Single β chains showed a typical ER staining (Fig. 2, A–C, +Tx) and were not detected at the plasma membrane (−Tx). When the α chain was co-transfected with the β chain, HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP were still localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2, A–C, +Tx); however, cell surface expression was observed on nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 2, A–C, −Tx). This indicates that a proportion of αβ dimers was able to reach the cell surface. Co-expression of the Ii with αβ dimers, however, resulted in a punctate staining indicative of endosomal-lysosomal localization (Fig. 2, A–C, +Tx), similar to that seen in professional APCs. Quantification of repeat experiments showed that of ∼70 cells counted, 80% (DP), 93% (DR), and 86% (DQ) of αβ+Ii+DM-expressing cells were positive for the appearance of endosomal-lysosomal structures, as expected from previous experiments with DM (20van Lith M. Benham A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5430-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). DP, DQ, and DR were all able to rescue the known “swollen endosomal-lysosomal vesicle” phenotype that arose when cells expressed Ii alone (supplemental Fig. 1) (24Arunachalam B. Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the presence of the Ii, MHC class II molecules were readily observed at the cell surface (Fig. 2, A–C, −Tx). Additional expression of DM did not change the intracellular and cell surface expression of MHC class II molecules (Fig. 2, right panels). Thus, MHC class II αβ dimers of all subtypes require the Ii to reach the endosomal-lysosomal system. Cell surface expression of HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP in the absence of the Ii is consistent with previous observations (23Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 25Elliott E.A. Drake J.R. Amigorena S. Elsemore J. Webster P. Mellman I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp.

Strubin M. Mach B. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1490-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The result is not likely to be an artifact of overexpression because expression levels were similar to or lower than those found in APCs (20van Lith M. Benham A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5430-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the β chain alone did not reach the cell surface. Thus, not only DR, but also DQ and DP interacted physically (Fig. 1) and functionally (Fig. 2) with Ii. The acquisition of a stable binding peptide results in a conformational change that renders HLA-DRαβ dimers resistant to dissociation in SDS-containing sample buffer at room temperature (28Gorga J.C. Horejsí V. Johnson D.R. Raghupathy R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16087-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the assembly of HLA-DR (DR1) with HLA-DQ (DQ5) and -DP (DP4), we made use of this well established SDS stability assay. We co-transfected MHC class II α and β chains with different combinations of Ii and DM. The expression levels of Ii and DM were confirmed by Western blotting (not shown). To analyze DP, DQ, and DR, lysates in SDS-containing sample buffer were left at room temperature or were boiled. As expected, formation of SDS-stable DRαβ dimers required expression of both the Ii and DM (using the anti-DRα mAb 1B5; Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Expression of either the Ii or DM alone was not sufficient to induce the formation of SDS-stable DR dimers (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 7 and 8; see also Fig. 5 in 20van Lith M. Benham A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5430-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Disulfide bonds in HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP. HeLa cells were transfected with different combinations of α, β, Ii, and DM. Lysates were analyzed by reducing (R, bottom panels) and nonreducing (NR, top panels) SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting (WB) with 1B5 (anti-DRα, A), anti-DRβ (B), anti-DQ (C), and anti-DP (D). The positions of monomeric α and β chains are indicated on the left. Note that that the polyclonal antisera against DQ and DP weakly detect the α chains (especially under nonreducing conditions). Bands 1 and 2 represent two oxidation states in monomeric DRβ and DPβ. Bands 3 and 4 represent likely disulfide-linked DPβ homodimers and disulfide-linked DPαβ heterodimers, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, the requirements for HLA-DQ to become SDS-stable were different from those for HLA-DR. Co-expression of the Ii alone resulted in SDS-stable DQαβ dimers (using a polyclonal anti-DQ serum) (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Additional expression of DM increased the amount of SDS-stable DQαβ dimers (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that DM promoted peptide loading of HLA-DQ. Co-expression of DM in the absence of the Ii resulted in a negligible amount of dimers (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8), probably because DQαβ did not intersect with lysosomal loading compartments without the Ii (Fig. 2B). To confirm that DQ could form SDS-stable dimers with co-expression of the Ii only, we used two additional anti-DQ mAbs, L2 and SPV-L3. Both L2 and SPV-L3 clearly detected DQ dimers when co-expressed with the Ii (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 7 and 8) but did not recognize DQαβ dimers when only α and β chains were expressed (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6). The blot was co-probed with HC10 (detecting MHC class I; cI.I) to confirm equal loading of the samples. In stark contrast to HLA-DR1 and -DQ5, HLA-DP4 was not dependent on either the Ii or DM to form SDS-stable dimers (using a polyclonal DP antiserum; Fig. 3D, lanes 1 and 2). Ii alone facilitated the formation of slightly more compact αβ dimers (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 2 and 4). DM alone also facilitated SDS-stable DP dimer formation (Fig. 3D, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that the targeting of DP to the lysosomal system was not required for its stability. Co-expression of Ii and DM further increased the amount of SDS-stable DP dimers (Fig. 3D, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, either Ii or DM alone may facilitate the transition of HLA-DP to a more compact dimer state. Note that the amount of monomeric DQ and DP detected before and after boiling remained similar, whereas the amount of DRα detected after boiling increased. This may be because the DP and DQ antibodies detect monomers less efficiently than 1B5. The DP serum also detected a background band at 50 kDa (*, Fig. 3D), the intensity of which varied between experiments. However, the presence of the background band did not influence the recovery of stable DPαβ dimers. As shown in Fig. 3E, when the background band was absent, stable DP dimers formed between the DPαβ chains alone, and these became more compact in the presence of Ii. This experiment also shows that DPβ chains alone did not form SDS-stable dimers. In addition, incubation of semipermeabilized HLA-DP transfectants with a specific DP-binding peptide resulted in an increased recovery of stable dimer, showing that DP molecules could be stabilized by peptide in this system (supplemental Fig. 2 and supplemental Experimental Procedures). To see whether the unusual stability of DP4 was shared by other DP molecules, we tested DPB1*1701, a beryllium disease-associated allele. This allele also gave SDS-stable dimers in the absence of the Ii and DM (Fig. 4A, lane 2). The amount of stable DPB1*1701 αβ dimers increased with co-expression of the Ii, further demonstrating that DP stability was unusual in that it did not require DM (Fig. 4A, lane 6). The observed stability of DPαβ might reflect epitope(s) specifically detected by the anti-DP serum. To examine whether a different antibody could detect SDS-stable DP dimers, we used the DP-reactive mAb KUL/05 (29Giacomini P. Tecce R. Nicotra M.R. Cohen B.B. Mazzilli M.C. Natali P.G. J. Immunogenet. 1989; 16: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). KUL/05 recognized DPβ monomers and DP dimers in DPαβ transfectants, demonstrating that the detection of DP stability was not an antibody-specific phenomenon (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). The amount of dimers increased when DPαβ was co-transfected with the Ii and DM, as expected (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). The DP dimers in transfectants were similar to those in MelJuso, a cell line that expresses MHC class II molecules endogenously (Fig. 4C, lanes 5–8). Note that the recognition of DP monomers decreased in cells expressing endogenous DP (Fig. 4C, lanes 7 and 8) but that both dimers and monomers could be detected by the DP antiserum after immunoprecipitation from MelJuso with the HL40 mAb (Fig. 4C, lanes 11 and 12). Taken together, these data demonstrate that a pool of HLA-DPαβ molecules, unlike HLA-DR1 and -DQ5, can assemble in the absence of the Ii and become SDS-stable without intersecting the lysosomal pathway. The differences in the SDS stability of DR, DQ, and DP could result from differences in the folding and intrinsic stability of the class II molecules. Having observed that oxidative protein folding is important for heterodimeric (and Ii-independent) assembly of DM (20van Lith M. Benham A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5430-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we compared the disulfide-dependent protein oxidation of HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP (Fig. 5). Lysates from HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP transfectants were analyzed by Western blotting after nonreducing SDS-PAGE to preserve intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. The “nonreducing” complexes observed in these experiments were obtained after boiling in sample buffer −DTT and are therefore not the same as those observed in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, which are obtained without boiling in sample buffer +DTT. All β chains migrated faster under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5, B–D), indicating the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. This was regardless of whether β was co-expressed with α chains or accessory proteins. In contrast, the α chains migrated similarly under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5, A, C, and D, compare R with NR), although note that the DQ and DP antisera only weakly recognized the α chains, especially under nonreducing conditions. The difference between α and β chains in migration under nonreducing conditions is explained by the presence of two long range disulfide bonds in β chains versus one in α chains, which makes the β proteins more compact under nonreducing/denaturing conditions. Despite these general similarities for DR, DQ, and DP, there are some marked differences. Unlike the DQβ monomers, the DRβ and DPβ monomers existed in two distinct oxidation states (Fig. 5, B–D, top panels, bands 1 and 2 for DR and DP). This may be explained by the presence of additional cysteine residues in DRβ and DPβ. The DRα chain also appeared as a doublet, but this did not reflect different oxidation states, as the pattern was essentially the same under reducing conditions (Fig. 5A, lanes 3–5). Rather, the DRα doublet is most likely due to two differently glycosylated pools (30Shackelford D.A. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 274-282PubMed Google Scholar), similar to that seen for DMα (20van Lith M. Benham A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5430-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The nonreducing gels also revealed differences in disulfide-linked complexes across the three MHC class II molecules. In contrast to DR and DP, DQ hardly formed any disulfide-linked complexes, which may reflect the absence of any unpaired cysteine residues in this molecule (Fig. 5C). The disulfide-linked DRα and DRβ dimers and higher molecular mass complexes gradually diminished with further reconstitution (Fig. 5, A and B, top panels). All dimers and high molecular mass complexes disappeared under reducing conditions (data not shown; see also Fig. 3, A–D, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). DPα and β formed complexes at ∼50 kDa (Fig. 5D): a lower one when DPβ was expressed alone (lane 2, band 3), and an additional higher one when DPα was co-expressed (lanes 3–5, band 4). Therefore, band 3 probably represented DPβ disulfide-linked dimers, whereas band 4 could represent DPαβ disulfide-linked dimers, as they were only present when DPα was co-expressed. The presence of band 4 in DPαβ transfectants (and in combination with Ii and DM) correlated with the requirements for the SDS stability of DP (Fig. 3D) and raised the possibility that a disulfide-bonded complex between DPαβ might be responsible for DP stability in the absence of the Ii. To exclude that disulfide-linked DPαβ dimers accounted for the SDS stability of DP in DPαβ transfectants, we made use of a single cysteine mutant of DPβ, C211A. In contrast to wild-type DPβ, this mutant did not generate band 4 when co-expressed with DPα (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4). This mutant, however, was still able to form SDS-stable dimers when DPα"

S., Okada, M., and Langenbach, R. (2009) Carcinogenesis 30, 1620-1627). Because keratinocyte proliferation is essential for skin tumor development, EP2-mediated signaling pathways that contribute to keratinocyte proliferation were investigated. A single topical application of the EP2 agonist, butaprost, dose-dependently increased keratinocyte replication via activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PKA signaling. Because GPCR-mediated activation of EGFR can involve the formation of a GPCR-β-arrestin-Src signaling complex, the possibility of a β-arrestin1-Src complex contributing to EP2-mediated signaling in keratinocytes was investigated. Butaprost induced β-arrestin1-Src complex formation and increased both Src and EGFR activation. A role for β-arrestin1 in EP2-mediated Src and EGFR activation was demonstrated by the observation that β-arrestin1 deficiency significantly reduced Src and EGFR activation. In agreement with a β-arrestin1-Src complex contributing to EGFR activation, Src and EGFR inhibition (PP2 and AG1478, respectively) indicated that Src was upstream of EGFR. Butaprost also induced the activation of Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3, and both β-arrestin1 deficiency and EGFR inhibition (AG1478 or gefitinib) decreased their activation. In addition to β-arrestin1-dependent EGFR activation, butaprost increased PKA activation, as measured by phospho-GSK3β (p-GSK3β) and p-cAMP-response element-binding protein formation. PKA inhibition (H89 or R(P)-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (R(P)-cAMPS)) decreased butaprost-induced cAMP-response element-binding protein and ERK activation but did not affect EGFR activation, whereas β-arrestin1 deficiency decreased EGFR activation but did not affect butaprost-induced PKA activation, thus indicating that they were independent EP2-mediated pathways. Therefore, the results indicate that EP2 contributed to mouse keratinocyte proliferation by G protein-independent, β-arrestin1-dependent activation of EGFR and G protein-dependent activation of PKA."

Mayo M.A. Maniloff J. Desselberger U. Ball L.A. (eds) Virus Taxonomy: Eighth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego2005Google Scholar). This variability has obscured for years the observation of commonalities in the evolutionary origin, basic design, and life cycle strategies of these viruses. Besides the well studied principles in capsid architecture (2Casjens S. Chiu W. Burnett R.M. Garcea R.L. Structural Biology of Viruses. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 38-79Google Scholar), it is becoming clear that there are basic components of viral structures, such as the capsid and connector proteins in the case of bacteriophages, which share a surprising degree of similarity, as well as common general mechanisms of the maturation leading to the infective virion (3Valpuesta J.M.

These three types of proteins must interact properly to yield a fully functional prohead with appropriate shape and size. Recent work suggests that the structure of these three basic components has been widely conserved across different bacteriophages. In particular, the fold of the shell protein was first described for the bacteriophage HK97 (12Hendrix R.W. Adv. Virus Res. 2005; 64: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Wikoff W.R.

The HK97-like fold includes two domains: the P-domain, consisting of a long α-helix and an elongated three-stranded β-sheet, and the A-domain, composed of two α-helices and an additional β-sheet. Different bacteriophages incorporate additional domains in the main shell protein fold, resulting in different assembly mechanisms. A major event in the maturation of dsDNA viruses is the packaging of the nucleic acid into the prohead. For this purpose, a complex machinery, consisting of the ATPases and pilot proteins, is assembled at the vertex of the prohead where the connector is located (3Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 107-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the DNA packaging, the prohead undergoes a number of structural transformations (5Steven A.C. Heymann J.B. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Conway J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11King J. Chiu W. Chiu W. Burnett R.M. Garcea R.L.

Biol. 2010; 20: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that can include expansion of the shell, in situ monomer rearrangements, release of the scaffolding proteins or incorporation of new components, such as accessory shell proteins or the virus tail, and chemical modifications such as cleavage or covalent cross-linking. The final outcome is a mature, infective virion. Virus assembly and maturation offer a unique opportunity to dissect two correlated aspects: first, how a limited set of components is able to assemble in a complex structure; and second, the molecular basis of the process leading to the acquisition of stability necessary to search for the proper host. The existence of three transformation mechanisms to acquire shell stability has been recently reviewed (20Parent K.N. Khayat R. Tu L.H. Suhanovsky M.M. Cortines J.R. Teschke C.M. Johnson J.E. Baker T.S. Structure. 2010; 18: 390-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The most common mechanism is the incorporation of accessory proteins that establish an additional set of contacts to reinforce those built by the main shell protein in the prohead. The contact sites for the accessory proteins are usually exposed after the rearrangement of the shell protein monomers during maturation, thus avoiding premature interactions leading to abortive assemblies. This mechanism applies to HSV-1 (21Trus B.L. Booy F.P. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. Homa F.L. Thomsen D.R. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and adenovirus (22Saban S.D. Silvestry M. Nemerow G.R. Stewart P.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12049-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), as well as to the bacteriophages, lambda (23Yang F. Forrer P. Dauter Z. Conway J.F. Cheng N. Cerritelli M.E. Steven A.C.

Nature. 2008; 451: 1130-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A second mechanism involves the generation of new interactions between neighboring subunits by using additional domains inserted within the primitive protein sequence. This strategy is employed by phages φ29 (15Morais M.C. Choi K.H. Koti J.S. Chipman P.R. Anderson D.L. Rossmann M.G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and P22, in which the presence of an inserted domain with a telokin Ig-like fold has been related to a direct assembly of the capsid from monomeric subunits instead of intermediate capsomeric subassemblies (20Parent K.N. Khayat R. Tu L.H. Suhanovsky M.M. Cortines J.R. Teschke C.M. Johnson J.E. Baker T.S. Structure. 2010; 18: 390-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The third mechanism, which appears to be unique to HK97, involves the formation of covalent intersubunit cross-linking, leading to extensive interlocking of the shell in a giant superstructure (26Conway J.F. Duda R.L. Cheng N. Hendrix R.W. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The maturation process in bacteriophage T7 is of particular interest because the virus does not have accessory proteins, inserted domains, or cross-linking between subunits. T7 infects Escherichia coli and belongs to the Podoviridae family. It has a 40-kb dsDNA, an icosahedral capsid with a triangulation number of T = 7, and a non-contractile tail (27Cerritelli M.E. Conway J.F. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Chiu W. Johnson J.E. Richards F.M. Eisenberg D.S. Kuriyan J. Advances in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2003: 301-323Google Scholar). The shell is made of 415 copies of protein gp10A. The prohead also contains a scaffolding protein (gp9) and a dodecameric connector (gp8) that attaches a core complex formed by proteins gp14, gp15, and gp16 to one of the 12 5-fold vertices (28Agirrezabala X. Martín-Benito J. Castón J.R. Miranda R. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The virus tail is added to this vertex in the mature virion. The packaging machinery is also located at this vertex, forming a portal by incorporating terminases that select, cleave, and push the DNA inside the viral head through the connector. More specifically, the T7 prohead interacts with terminase gp19 to package the complex built by the DNA and terminase gp18 after cutting the unit length DNA from the replicating concatemers (29Fujisawa H. Morita M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The maturation of T7 involves the disappearance of the scaffolding protein, major rearrangements of the core, the incorporation of the tail, and a dramatic transformation of the shell, which undergoes a radial expansion. The structure of the T7 prohead has been solved by three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 2The abbreviation used is: cryo-EMcryo-electron microscopy. at 2 nm resolution (27Cerritelli M.E. Conway J.F. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Chiu W. Johnson J.E. Richards F.M. Eisenberg D.S. Kuriyan J. Advances in Protein Chemistry.

Gómez-Puertas P. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Structure. 2007; 15: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), revealing that the main protein gp10A has an HK97-like fold. cryo-electron microscopy. Here, we perform the cryo-EM reconstruction of the mature capsid together with a quasi-atomic model of its shell to elucidate the molecular details of T7 maturation. Comparing the shell of the prohead and the mature head reveals that T7 follows a maturation scheme that involves a change in the shell diameter from 51 to 60 nm and a decrease in its thickness from 4.5 to 2.3 nm due to a major rearrangement of the subunit domains. These transformations are based on the tilting, rotation, and radial translation of gp10 monomers, resulting in a higher intermonomeric interacting surface. Our results suggest that T7 might represent one of the simplest primordial capsid maturation mechanisms. Mature T7 virions were purified from E. coli lysates of BL21 cells infected with wild type phage using sucrose gradient centrifugation as described elsewhere (28Agirrezabala X. Martín-Benito J.

Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The composition of the purified viral particles was validated by SDS-PAGE analysis in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. The viral DNA was released by incubation with 1 m NaClO4 at 37 °C during 16 h. The empty heads were further purified by 10–40% sucrose gradient centrifugation. The homogeneity and overall quality of the samples was tested by electron microscopy of negatively stained aliquots. The samples were finally dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m NaCl before cryo-electron microscopy. The samples were frozen in liquid ethane and transferred to an FEI TecnaiG2 FEG200 cryo-electron microscope. Image acquisition and processing were performed as described previously (30Agirrezabala X. Martín-Benito J. Valle M. González J.M. Valencia A. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More specifically, the micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film under low dose conditions at a nominal magnification of 50,000×, digitized in a Zeiss scanner (Photoscan TD, Z/I Imaging Corp.) using a 7-μm step, and sampled to 0.14 nm/pixel. A total of 5100 particles were used to compute mean intensities and variances and to remove linear background gradients. The three-dimensional reconstruction was performed using the software packages Bsoft (31Heymann J.B. Belnap D.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), Spider (32Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), and Xmipp (33Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Nat.

Icosahedral symmetry was imposed throughout the refinement process. The final resolution for the reconstruction of the mature capsid was 1.08 nm using the 0.5 Fourier shell correlation criterion and 0.9 nm for 0.3 Fourier shell correlation (supplemental Fig. S1). Automated B-factor determination and compensation were performed with the EM-BFACTOR program, with a value for Brestore of −5.29 nm2 (35Fernández J.J. Luque D. Castón J.R. Carrascosa J.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 164: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Segmentation of the individual subunits from the reconstructed density was performed manually using the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Chimera software (36Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28368) Google Scholar). The segmentation was improved iteratively (17Agirrezabala X. Velázquez-Muriel J.A. Gómez-Puertas P. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Structure. 2007; 15: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential was calculated with the Coulombic Surface Coloring option in Chimera. Protein-protein interaction areas were determined using the PISA package (37Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6839) Google Scholar). They were defined as one-half of the difference between the total accessible area in isolated monomers and that of the monomers assembled in the complex (38Gretes M. Lim D.C. de Castro L. Jensen S.E. Kang S.G. Lee K.J. Strynadka N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Residues were considered interacting if any of the atoms were within 0.4 nm of each other, employing the CCP4i package (39Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The interactions were cross-checked using Chimera with similar results. To obtain the structure of the gp10A monomer in the mature capsid of T7, we started with a sequence alignment against the protein gp5 in the mature capsid of HK97 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1OHG). Segment Leu100–Glu345 in gp10A was aligned to segment Leu133–Pro373 in gp5 with PSI-BLAST (40Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar). Given the low sequence similarity between the two segments, we improved the alignment in Chimera by considering secondary structure computed with PSIPRED version 2.6 (41McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar), using the alignment score weight of 20%. The resulting alignment conserved secondary structure and had the sequence identity of 14%. A comparative model was obtained with MODELLER (42Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar) using standard parameters. The model was fit rigidly into the cryo-EM electron density by maximizing the cross-correlation using Chimera. Residues Leu126–Pro147 in the E-loop of gp10A were removed because the corresponding density in the cryo-EM map could not be determined unambiguously. Next, flexible fitting was performed. The model α-helices were first moved manually into the corresponding areas of the cryo-EM map using Chimera. The fit was refined by the Flex-EM program (43Topf M. Lasker K. Webb B. Wolfson H. Chiu W. Sali A. Structure. 2008; 16: 295-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), keeping the helices and sheets as rigid bodies, and optimized with the conjugated gradients (CG) option. The resulting model was further improved in a second Flex-EM run, refining all atoms independently from each other using a molecular dynamics optimization. Only 2% of residues in the resulting model were outliers in the Ramachandran plot. Seven copies of this model were fit sequentially as rigid bodies into the cryo-EM density of the whole asymmetric unit. Subsequently, the previously deleted E-loop was added to each of the seven model copies followed by a simultaneous relaxation of the loop atoms in the cryo-EM map, using five steps of molecular dynamics with Flex-EM (see Fig. 2C). Finally, a complete model of the mature shell was then obtained by applying the icosahedral symmetry to the model of the asymmetric unit followed by a refinement of atomic positions with the URO program (44Navaza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Alvarez-Rúa C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that allowed us to retain the icosahedral symmetry during the refinement. The correlation coefficient between the complete model and the cryo-EM map is 0.70, whereas the local cross-correlation coefficient is 0.81. The new structure for gp10A in the prohead was generated from gp5 in the prohead II of HK97 (PDB ID 3E8K). The same approach used for the mature head was employed, and the new model was basically identical to that published before (17Agirrezabala X. Velázquez-Muriel J.A. Gómez-Puertas P. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Structure. 2007; 15: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but it presented some minor reassignments of residues for the secondary structure elements. In this new structure, the E-loops were modeled, first manually adjusted, and refined later with molecular dynamics. Visual inspection of the fitting showed that E-loops are in the electron density previously assigned to them (17Agirrezabala X. Velázquez-Muriel J.A. Gómez-Puertas P. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Structure. 2007; 15: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although we consider their fitting less reliable than in the mature capsid. All graphical representations were rendered using the UCSF Chimera software. An earlier study of T7 at 2 nm resolution using cryo-EM and three-dimensional reconstruction without imposing symmetry constraints revealed the overall changes undergone by the shell and the core-connector complex during the transformation of the prohead to the mature virus (28Agirrezabala X. Martín-Benito J. Castón J.R. Miranda R. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An improvement in the resolution to 1 nm by imposing icosahedral symmetry resulted in a quasi-atomic model of the prohead showing that the shell is formed by gp10A subunits arranged in an HK97-like conformation (17Agirrezabala X. Velázquez-Muriel J.A. Gómez-Puertas P. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Structure. 2007; 15: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have solved the structure of the mature capsid by a combination of single particle cryo-EM three-dimensional reconstruction using icosahedral symmetry and protein modeling. Then, we compared this structure with the T7 procapsid to learn about the molecular basis of this maturation process. Preliminary reconstructions from purified mature T7 virions showed that the presence of DNA inside the capsid did not allow us to define the precise boundaries between the inner shell face and the outermost DNA layer. Thus, to obtain an accurate segmentation of the shell electron density and subsequently perform molecular modeling, we first eliminated the DNA from the virions by treating the preparation with a solution of NaClO4 until total DNA ejection. After DNase treatment and further purification with sucrose gradient centrifugation, we obtained mature empty capsids composed of the main shell protein gp10A with only minor contents of gp10B and traces of the tail and core components (supplemental Fig. S2). The electron density map (Fig. 1) of the empty capsid obtained by cryo-EM and three-dimensional reconstruction (see “Experimental Procedures”) had a resolution of ∼1 nm and was fully consistent with those obtained previously at lower resolution (Fig. 1A). The shell had an overall diameter of 60 nm with an average thickness of 2.5 nm, with the outer face being more corrugated than the inner face (Fig. 1B). The outer surface of the shell was smoother than in the prohead, and the gp10A protein formed almost symmetrical hexamers (Fig. 1C), with noticeable pentamers at the capsid vertices (Fig. 1D). The asymmetric unit of the shell was segmented, and each of the seven copies of the protein gp10A was extracted manually. The segmentation was improved by an iterative alignment and averaging of the independent densities of the monomers. The resulting structures (Fig. 2A) showed that the mature subunit resembles that of the prohead shell, but important changes were also evident. The previously skewed hexamers of gp10A were more symmetric and more similar to the pentamers, which did not appear to have changed their 5-fold overall morphology. The structure of the monomer in the mature shell was similar for both the pentamer and the hexamer and was flatter than in the prohead, thus building a more extended capsomer. The observed similarity between the folds of the shell proteins gp10A in T7 and gp5 in HK97 was used to produce a quasi-atomic structure of the shell in the mature head of T7, as it was previously done for the prohead (17Agirrezabala X.

We used the coordinates of gp5 in the mature shell of HK97, solved by x-ray crystallography (13Wikoff W.R. Liljas L. Duda R.L. Tsuruta H. Hendrix R.W. Johnson J.E. Science. 2000; 289: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 45Helgstrand C. Wikoff W.R. Duda R.L. Hendrix R.W. Johnson J.E. Liljas L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), to build a comparative model for gp10A that was flexibly fitted into the cryo-EM density of gp10A obtained by segmentation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2B shows two views of the fitted model, with the A-domain (residues 210–300) in red, the P-domain (residues 100–119, 154–209, and 301–345) in yellow, and the E-loop (residues 120–153) in blue. An initial asymmetric shell unit was built using this model, after which the structure of each of the seven monomers was individually refined against its corresponding experimental density (Fig. 2C). The structural alignment of the seven different monomers showed a good overall fit, with the exception of the E-loop in the pentameric monomer, which showed a significant bend (∼30°) toward the interior of the capsid, as compared with the E-loop in the hexameric monomers. The model for the whole shell was obtained by applying icosahedral symmetry followed by global refinement. The final molecular structure reproduced well the features of the cryo-EM map, with an overall correlation coefficient of 0.70 for the fitting and a local correlation coefficient of 0.81 for the area corresponding to the modeled coordinates. The resulting model showed that the shell of the mature capsid contains extensive contacts between subunits, with the A-domain mostly involved in the interactions between monomers within capsomers and the P-domain mostly involved in the interfaces between the pentamers and the hexamers. The most significant difference between the structure of gp10A in the mature head with respect to the prohead was the bending of the A-domain relative to the P-domain by 22° (Fig. 3A), which makes them more parallel to the shell surface. A similar relative movement between the A- and P-domains has previously been found in the maturation of HK97 (46Gertsman I. Gan L. Guttman M. Lee K. Speir J.A. Duda R.L. Hendrix R.W. Komives E.A.

DLL4 regulates crucial processes in vascular growth, including endothelial cell (EC) sprouting and arterial specification. Its expression is increased by VEGF-A. In the present study, we show that VEGF-induced DLL4 expression depends on NOTCH activation. VEGF-induced DLL4 expression was prevented by the blockage of NOTCH signaling with γ-secretase or ADAM inhibitors in human cardiac microvascular ECs. Similar to VEGF-A, recombinant DLL4 itself stimulated NOTCH signaling and resulted in up-regulation of DLL4, suggesting a positive feed-forward mechanism. These effects were abrogated by NOTCH inhibitors but not by inhibition of VEGF signaling. NOTCH activation alone suffices to induce DLL4 expression as illustrated by the positive effect of NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD)-1 or -4 overexpression. To discriminate between NICD/RBP-Jκ and FOXC2-regulated DLL4 expression, DLL4 promoter activity was assessed in promoter deletion experiments. NICD induced promoter activity was dependent on RBP-Jκ site but independent of the FOXC2 binding site. Accordingly, constitutively active FOXC2 did not affect DLL4 expression. The notion that the positive feed-forward mechanism might propagate NOTCH activation to neighboring ECs was supported by our observation that DLL4-eGFP-transfected ECs induced DLL4 expression in nontransfected cells in their vicinity. In summary, our data provide evidence for a mechanism by which VEGF or ligand-induced NOTCH signaling up-regulates DLL4 through a positive feed-forward mechanism. By this mechanism, DLL4 could propagate its own expression and enable synchronization of NOTCH expression and signaling between ECs.

The notion that the positive feed-forward mechanism might propagate NOTCH activation to neighboring ECs was supported by our observation that DLL4-eGFP-transfected ECs induced DLL4 expression in nontransfected cells in their vicinity. In summary, our data provide evidence for a mechanism by which VEGF or ligand-induced NOTCH signaling up-regulates DLL4 through a positive feed-forward mechanism. By this mechanism, DLL4 could propagate its own expression and enable synchronization of NOTCH expression and signaling between ECs. IntroductionThe NOTCH family encompasses a fundamental signaling pathway involving four receptors (NOTCH-1, -2, -3, and -4) and, in vertebrates, five cognate ligands (DLL-1, -3, and -4, and JAGGED-1 and -2). Cell-cell contact is a prerequisite for NOTCH signaling as all members are membrane bound. The first activation step upon receptor-ligand interaction involves cleavage of the extracellular domain of the NOTCH receptor by ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease). Subsequently, the γ-secretase complex instigates a second proteolytic cleavage resulting in the release of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) 2The abbreviations used are: NICDNOTCH intracellular domainDLL4DELTA like-4 ligandFBEforkhead binding elementVEGFRVEGF receptorHCMvEChuman cardiac microvascular endothelial cellPAECporcine aortic endothelial cellqPCRquantitative PCRMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidANOVAanalysis of varianceNICDNOTCH intracellular domainECendothelial cellFOXCForkhead box C. into the cytoplasm. Next, the NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with the Recombinant signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBP-Jκ) CBF1/RBP-Jκ, Su(H), Lag1 (CSL) transcription factor to initiate the transcription of its downstream targets basic helix-loop-helix proteins HES (hairy/enhancer of split) and hairy related transcription factors (HRT, HEY, and HERP) (1Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar).Among the ligands, DLL4 is specifically expressed in the arterial endothelium and plays a major role during embryonic vascular development. Dll4 haploinsufficiency is embryonically lethal due to severe vascular abnormalities related to a loss of arterial and venous specification (2Gale N.W. Dominguez M.G. Noguera I. Pan L. Hughes V. Valenzuela D.M. Murphy A.J. Adams N.C. Lin H.C. Holash J. Thurston G. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15949-15954Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 3Iso T.

DLL4 overexpression on the other hand induces arterialization even in the venous compartment that typically lacks NOTCH expression (8Trindade A. Kumar S.R. Scehnet J.S. Lopes-da-Costa L. Becker J. Jiang W. Liu R. Gill P.S. Duarte A. Blood. 2008; 112: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).NOTCH signaling is important for the development of endothelial cell sprouting. In this process, VEGF induces the formation of new sprouts, whereas DLL4 signaling appears to reduce their formation (9Phng L.K. Gerhardt H. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 196-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 10Lobov I.B. Renard R.A. Papadopoulos N. Gale N.W. Thurston G. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3219-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Because DLL4 is up-regulated by VEGF (11Liu Z.J. Shirakawa T. Li Y. Soma A. Oka M. Dotto G.P. Fairman R.M. Velazquez O.C. Herlyn M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), this signaling pathway might serve as a negative feedback loop with respect to endothelial sprouting. This feedback could be bidirectional as NOTCH reduces VEGF responsiveness through down-regulation of VEGFR-2 (12Segarra M. Williams C.K. Sierra Mde L. Bernardo M. McCormick P.J. Maric D. Regino C. Choyke P. Tosato G. Blood. 2008; 112: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and subsequently suppresses the sprouting phenotype in the adjacent stalk cell, thus limiting the number of sprouts. Accordingly, loss of DLL4 function promotes excessive endothelial cell sprouting and endothelial cell migration (13Benedito R. Trindade A. Hirashima M. Henrique D. da Costa L.L. Rossant J. Gill P.S. Duarte A. BMC Dev. Biol. 2008; 8: 117Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). VEGF-A has also been reported to induce the activation of ADAM-10 and -17 (14Swendeman S. Mendelson K. Weskamp G. Horiuchi K. Deutsch U. Scherle P. Hooper A. Rafii S. Blobel C.P. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which are the proteases required for the first step in NOTCH activation. This interrelation between VEGF-A and NOTCH signaling suggests that VEGF not only induces the expression of DLL4 but also stimulates NOTCH signaling. However, alternative pathways have been suggested for VEGF-induced DLL4 expression. Up-regulation of DLL4 by VEGF has been considered the result of activated Forkhead box C (FOXC) transcription factors by a PI3K and ERK/MAPK-dependent pathway (15Hayashi H. Kume T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). FOXC2 has been shown to activate the DLL4 and HEY2 promoters, which both contain a forkhead binding element (FBE) (15Hayashi H. Kume T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Seo S. Fujita H. Nakano A. Kang M. Duarte A. Kume T. Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In particular, FOXC2 functionally interacts with RBP-Jκ and NICD to activate the HEY2 promoter (15Hayashi H. Kume T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly to HEY2, the DLL4 promoter presents with multiple RBP-Jκ binding sites (17Diez H. Fischer A. Winkler A. Hu C.J. Hatzopoulos A.K. Breier G. Gessler M. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), suggesting that NOTCH might regulate DLL4 expression as well. Altogether, these observations prompted us to speculate that NOTCH signaling could play a role in up-regulating the expression of its own ligand DLL4, which in turn would activate NOTCH signal transduction, thus creating a positive feed-forward signaling that propagates the activation to adjacent cells.In the present study, we show that in endothelial cells, VEGF-induced DLL4 up-regulation is NOTCH activation-dependent. VEGF positively affects DLL4 expression and NOTCH signaling mainly by activating VEGFR-2, whereas inhibition of NOTCH signaling abrogated VEGF-induced DLL4 expression. Consistently, immobilized recombinant DLL4 also induced endogenous DLL4 expression in a NOTCH-dependent manner unrelated to VEGF signaling, indicating a feed-forward mechanism downstream of NOTCH. The increase in DLL4, along with transactivation of the DLL4 promoter by NICD-1 and NICD-4 confirmed the role of NOTCH signaling in this process, further suggesting that NOTCH activation is sufficient for DLL4 induction. In this endothelial system, we found no evidence for FOXC2-dependent DLL4 expression by VEGF. Finally, we show that DLL4 transfected endothelial cells were able to increase DLL4 expression of surrounding cells providing a mechanism by which NOTCH signaling is distributed between communicating endothelial cells.DISCUSSIONThe VEGF and NOTCH signaling pathways and their intricate interactions are indispensable for regulating blood vessel formation. VEGF-A has been reported to modulate the expression of NOTCH members in arterial endothelial cells. VEGFR-2 acts as the main receptor in mediating VEGF signaling in vascular endothelial cells (22Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar) and likewise has been suggested to positively regulate NOTCH/DELTA expression (10Lobov I.B. Renard R.A. Papadopoulos N. Gale N.W.

Res. 2008; 75: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Also a reciprocal effect of NOTCH signaling on the expression of VEGFR-2 has been reported, i.e. a reduction in VEGFR-2 and an increase in VEGFR-1 expression with subsequent drop in VEGFA responsiveness (32Harrington L.S. Sainson R.C. Williams C.K. Taylor J.M. Shi W. Li J.L. Harris A.L. Microvasc. Res. 2008; 75: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Accordingly, we show that in primary adult HCMvECs, the expression of DLL4 is stimulated by the VEGFR-2 acting ligands VEGF-A165 and VEGF-E, and not by PlGF-2. Intriguingly, no other NOTCH ligands beside DLL4 were affected by VEGF-A-related endothelial signaling (data not shown) suggesting a selectivity of VEGF-A-related signaling in primary adult microvascular ECs. The essential role of VEGFR-2 was confirmed in porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing only one of the receptors and with a specific VEGFR-2 inhibitor. The presented data clearly show that up-regulation of DLL4 by VEGF-A is NOTCH signaling-dependent. VEGF-A failed to induce DLL4 expression when NOTCH signaling was inhibited, indicating the requirement of activated NOTCH for this process. In addition, NOTCH signaling alone was sufficient to induce DLL4 expression as shown by NICD-1 and NICD-4 overexpression. A comparable effect of VEGF-A-induced DLL4 expression was described for embryonic (33Lanner F. Sohl M. Farnebo F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (4Zhang G. Zhou J. Fan Q. Zheng Z. Zhang F. Liu X. Hu S. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).We show that both NICD-1 and NICD-4 were able to transactivate the DLL4 promoter. Previous reports (15Hayashi H. Kume T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Seo S. Fujita H. Nakano A. Kang M. Duarte A. Kume T. Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) indicated that the FOXC2 transcription factor can serve as a mediator for VEGF-A-induced DLL4 expression by interacting with a FBE located in the DLL4 promoter. Besides the FBE, multiple RBP-Jκ binding sites are present in the DLL4 promoter sequence, providing the potential molecular cues for NOTCH-induced expression. Indeed, NICD-1 effectively transactivated both the full-length DLL4 promoter and FBE-deleted DLL4 promoter sequences, providing evidence that the FOX transcription factor pathway does not mediate VEGF-induced NOTCH activation in the endothelium. Accordingly, overexpression of a constitutively active FOXC2 transcript did not increase DLL4 expression. The FBE lacking −2616, −1587, and −931 promoter constructs showed a transactivation profile that suggests dependence on the number of RBP-Jκ binding sites. As expected, both NICD-1 and -4 were unable to stimulate the −931 DLL4 promoter fragment that lacked any RBP-Jκ binding site. NICD-4 had a similar profile of transactivation as NICD-1 with respect to −2616 and −1587 fragments but, in accordance with previous studies, at lower levels (34Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This difference likely relates to the presence of a C-terminal autonomous transactivation domain in the NICD-1, which acts independently of RBP-Jκ. Such a transactivation domain sequence is absent in the NICD-4, and consequently, it requires RBP-Jκ to initiate transcription (35Kato H. Sakai T. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Shirayoshi Y. Hamada Y. Tsujimoto Y. Honjo T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduced induction capacity of NICD-4 is likely related to the number of RBP-Jκ that are present in the shortened −2616 and −1587 DLL4 promoter fragments. Accordingly, no effect was shown by NICD-4 for the −931 DLL4 promoter fragment that contained only one RBP-Jκ binding site, whereas NICD-1 could still effectively transactivate this promoter.NOTCH is typically activated by one its ligands, including membrane-bound DLL4. Therefore, similar to VEGF-A, NOTCH activation by surface-bound recombinant DLL4 induced DLL4 expression in HCMvECs. Inhibition of NOTCH signaling, but not of VEGF signaling, was sufficient to prevent this induction. These data indicate that activated NOTCH can induce DLL4 expression and transactivate the DLL4 promoter in absence of FOXC transcription factors and support the observation that NOTCH can induce DLL4 expression independently of FOXC2-mediated VEGF signaling. To our knowledge, these results show for the first time that DLL4 induces its own expression in endothelial cells, most likely through direct NICD-mediated transcriptional regulation. VEGF signaling also induced the up-regulation of HES-1 and RBP-Jκ transactivation, indicating that VEGF-A activates NOTCH signaling. This activation is likely not secondary to ligand overexpression, as NOTCH inhibition prevented the VEGF-A-induced expression of DLL4.The link between VEGF-A and NOTCH signaling most likely relates to VEGFR2 increased ADAM expression and activity. In a previous study, we showed that ADAM expression and protease activity (i.e. sheddase) in HUVECs and VEGFR-2/PAEC was increased upon VEGF-A165 stimulation (36Donners M.M. Wolfs I.M. Olieslagers S. Mohammadi-Motahhari Z. Tchaikovski V. Heeneman S. van Buul J.D. Caolo V. Molin D.G. Post M.J. Waltenberger J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2188-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). VEGF-A has also been reported to induce the expression of ADAM-10 and to enhance shedding of VEGFR-2 and its co-receptor NRP1 by activating ADAM-10 and ADAM-17, respectively (14Swendeman S. Mendelson K. Weskamp G. Horiuchi K. Deutsch U. Scherle P. Hooper A. Rafii S. Blobel C.P. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although this mechanism has been postulated to modulate VEGF-A signaling (14Swendeman S. Mendelson K. Weskamp G. Horiuchi K. Deutsch U. Scherle P. Hooper A. Rafii S. Blobel C.P. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), VEGF-A increased ADAM sheddase activity might potentiate NOTCH signaling as well. In line with our observations, Hainaud et al. (37Hainaud P. Contrerès J.O. Villemain A. Liu L.X. Plouët J. Tobelem G. Dupuy E. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8501-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) showed an accumulation of cleaved NOTCH-4 in VEGF-A-treated HUVECs with concomitant up-regulation of the ADAM and presinilin (part of the γ-secretase complex) expression.The involvement of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in NOTCH processing and signaling has been unequivocally established (38Brou C.

Chem. 2009; 284: 31018-31027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). ADAM-10 mutant mice phenotypically resemble Notch-1 null mutants and die at embryonic day 9.5, whereas Adam-17 mutants are viable (43Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among others Bozkulak and Weinmaster (41Bozkulak E.C. Weinmaster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5679-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) showed that NOTCH-1 is a substrate for both ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 and, although ADAM-10 was essentially required for ligand induced NOTCH-1 signaling, ADAM-17 mediated ligand independent signaling. The importance of ADAM in NOTCH signaling was also reflected by our experiments showing that inhibition of ADAM activity abrogated the VEGF-A induced expression of DLL4 and the NOTCH transcription factor HES-1. In addition, rDLL4-induced DLL4 expression was depressed by blockage of ADAM activity as well. Altogether, these data indicate that VEGF-A activates ADAM, which is required for NOTCH signaling activation.The ability of the activated NOTCH receptor to specifically induce the expression of its ligand would provide endothelial cells a mechanism by which NOTCH signaling is distributed and propagated between communicating cells with initially a limited amount of ligand. A comparable positive feed-forward mechanism has recently been described to regulate the interaction between endothelial and mural cells. JAGGED-1 ligand expressing endothelial cells induced NOTCH-3 signaling activation in mural cells (44Liu H. Kennard S. Lilly B. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), that in turn promote JAGGED-1 expression. In this way, mural cells can interact more efficiently with endothelial cells and can activate NOTCH signaling of neighboring cells, maintaining and distributing the signal to other mural cells. In the setting of membrane-bound ligands, the positive feed-forward mechanism is especially attractive to expand the signal to distant cells. The regulation of ligand expression by NOTCH receptors has already been described in Drosophila (45de Celis J.F. Bray S. Development. 1997; 124: 3241-3251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NOTCH signaling was found to increase the expression of DELTA and SERRATE through a positive feedback loop during the regulation of the dorsoventral boundary of the developing wing (45de Celis J.F. Bray S. Development. 1997; 124: 3241-3251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, in vertebrates, DELTA-like ligands are required during somitogenesis for the maintenance of somite borders and accumulate in a NOTCH-dependent manner (46Bettenhausen B. Hrabĕ de Angelis M. Simon D. Guénet J.L. Gossler A. Development. 1995; 121: 2407-2418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Hrabĕ de Angelis M. McIntyre 2nd, J. Gossler A.

Development. 1997; 124: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The expression pattern of DLL4 ligand in arteries and sprouting vessels affects spatial distribution of NOTCH signaling in endothelial cells. During sprouting, tip endothelial cells will express high DLL4 levels and low NOTCH activity, whereas their neighbor stalk cells will have high NOTCH activity but low DLL4 expression. However, a static situation in which a subpopulation of cells presents high level of DLL4 and low NOTCH signaling is unlikely. NOTCH signaling is in fact required for arterial specification, and lack or reduction of NOTCH signaling would cause loss of arterial identity. Here, we show, that in contrast to eGFP-transfected cells, DLL4-eGFP ECs were able to induce DLL4 expression of nontransfected surrounding ECs, through a feed-forward mechanism, that was NOTCH signaling-dependent. Coordinated activation of NOTCH signaling would produce a wave of DLL4 expression that provides periodic NOTCH signaling activation in each cell (9Phng L.K. Gerhardt H. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 196-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could be important to maintain an arterial phenotype along a blood vessel and for regulating spatial patterning of branching as well (9Phng L.K. Gerhardt H. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 196-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 49Gerhardt H. Organogenesis. 2008; 4: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).In summary, stimulation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF-A165 up-regulates DLL4 expression by activating NOTCH signaling in HCMvECs, independently of FOXC2. The NOTCH involvement in regulating DLL4 expression indicates the existence of a feed-forward mechanism by which NOTCH signaling can be propagated between adjacent endothelial cells. IntroductionThe NOTCH family encompasses a fundamental signaling pathway involving four receptors (NOTCH-1, -2, -3, and -4) and, in vertebrates, five cognate ligands (DLL-1, -3, and -4, and JAGGED-1 and -2).

Next, the NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with the Recombinant signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBP-Jκ) CBF1/RBP-Jκ, Su(H), Lag1 (CSL) transcription factor to initiate the transcription of its downstream targets basic helix-loop-helix proteins HES (hairy/enhancer of split) and hairy related transcription factors (HRT, HEY, and HERP) (1Iso T.

DLL4 overexpression on the other hand induces arterialization even in the venous compartment that typically lacks NOTCH expression (8Trindade A. Kumar S.R. Scehnet J.S. Lopes-da-Costa L. Becker J. Jiang W. Liu R. Gill P.S. Duarte A. Blood. 2008; 112: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).NOTCH signaling is important for the development of endothelial cell sprouting. In this process, VEGF induces the formation of new sprouts, whereas DLL4 signaling appears to reduce their formation (9Phng L.K. Gerhardt H. Dev.

Accordingly, loss of DLL4 function promotes excessive endothelial cell sprouting and endothelial cell migration (13Benedito R. Trindade A. Hirashima M. Henrique D. da Costa L.L. Rossant J. Gill P.S. Duarte A. BMC Dev. Biol. 2008; 8: 117Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). VEGF-A has also been reported to induce the activation of ADAM-10 and -17 (14Swendeman S. Mendelson K. Weskamp G. Horiuchi K. Deutsch U. Scherle P. Hooper A. Rafii S. Blobel C.P. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which are the proteases required for the first step in NOTCH activation. This interrelation between VEGF-A and NOTCH signaling suggests that VEGF not only induces the expression of DLL4 but also stimulates NOTCH signaling. However, alternative pathways have been suggested for VEGF-induced DLL4 expression. Up-regulation of DLL4 by VEGF has been considered the result of activated Forkhead box C (FOXC) transcription factors by a PI3K and ERK/MAPK-dependent pathway (15Hayashi H. Kume T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). FOXC2 has been shown to activate the DLL4 and HEY2 promoters, which both contain a forkhead binding element (FBE) (15Hayashi H. Kume T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Seo S. Fujita H. Nakano A. Kang M. Duarte A. Kume T. Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In particular, FOXC2 functionally interacts with RBP-Jκ and NICD to activate the HEY2 promoter (15Hayashi H. Kume T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly to HEY2, the DLL4 promoter presents with multiple RBP-Jκ binding sites (17Diez H. Fischer A. Winkler A. Hu C.J. Hatzopoulos A.K. Breier G. Gessler M. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), suggesting that NOTCH might regulate DLL4 expression as well. Altogether, these observations prompted us to speculate that NOTCH signaling could play a role in up-regulating the expression of its own ligand DLL4, which in turn would activate NOTCH signal transduction, thus creating a positive feed-forward signaling that propagates the activation to adjacent cells.In the present study, we show that in endothelial cells, VEGF-induced DLL4 up-regulation is NOTCH activation-dependent. VEGF positively affects DLL4 expression and NOTCH signaling mainly by activating VEGFR-2, whereas inhibition of NOTCH signaling abrogated VEGF-induced DLL4 expression. Consistently, immobilized recombinant DLL4 also induced endogenous DLL4 expression in a NOTCH-dependent manner unrelated to VEGF signaling, indicating a feed-forward mechanism downstream of NOTCH. The increase in DLL4, along with transactivation of the DLL4 promoter by NICD-1 and NICD-4 confirmed the role of NOTCH signaling in this process, further suggesting that NOTCH activation is sufficient for DLL4 induction. In this endothelial system, we found no evidence for FOXC2-dependent DLL4 expression by VEGF. Finally, we show that DLL4 transfected endothelial cells were able to increase DLL4 expression of surrounding cells providing a mechanism by which NOTCH signaling is distributed between communicating endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002569735,"Phagocytosis by macrophages is essential for host defense, i.e. preventing invasion of pathogens and foreign materials. Macrophages engulf immunoglobulin G (IgG)-opsonized particles through the action of the receptors for the Fc of IgG (FcγRs). Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is a classical lipid chemoattractant derived from arachidonic acid. Leukotriene B(4) receptor 1 (BLT1), a high affinity LTB(4) receptor, is expressed in a variety of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Although LTB(4) has been shown to enhance macrophage phagocytosis, few studies have investigated the intracellular mechanisms involved in this in detail. Furthermore, there have been no reports of the direct cross-talk between LTB(4)-BLT1 and IgG-FcγRs signaling. Here, we show that FcγRs-dependent phagocytosis was attenuated in BLT1-deficient macrophages as compared with wild-type (WT) cells. Moreover, cross-talk between LTB(4)-BLT1 and IgG-FcγRs signaling was identified at the level of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and Rac, downstream of Syk. In addition, the trimeric G(i) protein (G(i)) was found to be essential for BLT1-dependent phagocytosis. Surprisingly, we found that LTB(4)-BLT1 signaling restores phagocytosis in the absence of FcγRs signaling. These data indicate that LTB(4)-BLT1 signaling plays a pivotal role in macrophage phagocytosis and innate immunity."

The efficiency of a truncated, catalytic DNA polymerase ι core enzyme was determined for nucleoside triphosphate incorporation opposite O6-methylG, using steady-state kinetic analyses. The results presented here corroborate previous work from this laboratory using full-length pol ι, which showed that dTTP incorporation occurs with high efficiency opposite O6-methylG. Misincorporation of dTTP opposite O6-methylG occurred with ∼6-fold higher efficiency than incorporation of dCTP. Crystal structures of the truncated form of pol ι with O6-methylG as the template base and incoming dCTP or dTTP were solved and showed that O6-methylG is rotated into the syn conformation in the pol ι active site and that dTTP misincorporation by pol ι is the result of Hoogsteen base pairing with the adduct.

Protonation of the N3 atom of dCTP and bifurcation of the N3 hydrogen between the N7 and O6 atoms of O6-methylG allow base pairing of the lesion with dCTP.

Alkylating agents damage DNA by reacting with the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in DNA bases. Human exposure to alkylating agents arises from endogenous (e.g. food-derived nitrosamines) and exogenous (e.g. tobacco-specific nitrosoamines and chemotherapeutic agents including temozolomide and streptozotocin) sources (1Drabl⊘s F.

The shape of the Watson-Crick-like O6-methylG:T base pair fits in the active site of the DNA polymerase without distorting the DNA, thereby contributing to the incorporation of dTTP opposite the lesion (17Tan H.B. Swann P.F. Chance E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5335-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, the sequence context of O6-methylG has been shown to influence the extent of dTTP incorporation by DNA polymerases opposite the lesion (18Singer B. Chavez F. Goodman M.F. Essigmann J.M. Dosanjh M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8271-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Replicative DNA polymerases catalyze the misincorporation of dTTP opposite O6-alkylG with similar or even higher efficiency than incorporation of the correct dCTP (4Loechler E.L. Green C.L.

Similarly, the Y-family DNA polymerases η, ι, and κ all show poor nucleotide discrimination when bypassing O6-alkylG (5Choi J.Y. Chowdhury G. Zang H. Angel K.C. Vu C.C. Peterson L.A. Guengerich F.P.

The high potential for mutation from misincorporation of nucleotides opposite O6-methylG and the potential roles of Y-family DNA polymerases in bypassing the adduct in vivo motivated our structural analyses of pol ι and the O6-methylG lesion.

The increasing evidence that pol ι utilizes rotation of the purine template into a syn conformation led to a hypothesis that the increased efficiency of dTTP over dCTP incorporation opposite O6-methylG by pol ι arises from a more stable Hoogsteen base pairing of T opposite O6-methylG than C in the pol ι active site (24Pence M.G.

Here, we report that the crystal structure of pol ι, in complex with a template O6-methylG, demonstrates that the lesion adopts a syn conformation in the pol ι active site. Important differences in the hydrogen bonding and base positioning of dCTP or dTTP opposite O6-methylG contribute to the increased efficiency of dTTP misincorporation opposite O6-methylG by pol ι. The self-complementary 18-mer DNA oligonucleotides 5′-TCTXGGGTCCTAGGACC(ddC)-3′ (X: O6-methylG and ddC: dideoxy CMP), 5′-TCTXGGGTCCTAGGACCC-3′, and 5′-TCTGGGGTCCTAGGACCC-3′ were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and purified using reversed-phase HPLC by the manufacturer. The recombinant catalytic fragment of pol ι (amino acids 1–420) was expressed as an GST:pol ι or MBP:pol ι (gift from F. W. Perrino, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC) fusion protein (GST or MBP positioned at the N terminus of pol ι) with a PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) cut site (LEVLFQG) four (GST) or seven (MBP) residues from the pol ι N-terminal methionine. The PreScission Protease recognition sequence and pol ι coding sequence were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. The plasmid constructs were transfected into Escherichia coli BL21 Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for overexpression. Cells were grown at 37 °C to O.D.600 0.5. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were allowed to grow for 15 h at 17 °C. Cell extracts were prepared, and the GST-pol ι fusion protein was bound to a 1-ml GSTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The fusion protein was cleaved directly on the column by the addition of PreScission Protease (2 units/ml) and incubation at 4 °C for 12–48 h. An eluted fraction containing human pol ι was collected and concentrated using a Centriprep® centrifugal concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA; supplemental Fig. S1). A280 measurements (ϵ280 = 16,390 m−1 cm−1) (28Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar) indicated a yield of ∼10–30 mg of pol ι per 4-liter preparation. For primer extension and kinetic assays, the G- and O6-methylG-containing DNA oligonucleotides were 5′ [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and annealed before being added to reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 200 μm dNTPs, and the amount of pol ι indicated (in the figure legends). Incubations were done for 10 min at 37 °C, and reactions were quenched with 30 μl of C2H5OH. Samples were dried and resuspended in 6 μl of a 95% formamide/0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue/0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol dye solution. Extension products were separated on 8 m urea/23% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, visualized using a phosphorimaging system, and quantified using Quantity One™ software (Bio-Rad). For steady-state kinetic assays, the site-specific insertion procedure of Boosalis et al. (29Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. The reaction conditions were the same as for the primer extension assays except that the concentration of pol ι was 5 nm, and only single nucleoside triphosphates were used, either dCTP or dTTP. The amount of pol ι in the reactions yielded ≤20% extended product. Incubations were for 10 min at 37 °C, and reactions were processed as described above. All extended product bands were used to determine kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Relative insertion frequencies were calculated as (kcat/Km)incorrect/(kcat/Km)correct. The purified pol ι catalytic core was concentrated to ∼11 mg of protein/ml using a Centriprep® centrifugal concentrator. The pol ι was mixed at a 1:1.2 molar ratio with the 3′ dideoxyC-terminated O6-methylG-containing oligonucleotide. To study ternary complexes, MgCl2 and dCTP (or dTTP) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 20 mm, respectively. Crystals grew from solutions prepared as described by Nair et al. (25Nair D.T.

Crystal trays were incubated at 4 °C, and diffraction quality crystals appeared in 1–3 days. The crystals belonged to space group P6522 and had cell dimensions of a = b = 97.9 Å, c = 202.5 Å for dCTP-containing crystals and a = b = 97.9 Å, c = 202.7 Å for dTTP-containing crystals, with α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. For data collection, crystals were step-soaked for 5 min in mother liquor solutions containing 0–25% glycerol (w/v) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 1.54 Å using a Bruker Microstar microfocus rotating-anode x-ray generator with a Bruker Proteum PT135 CCD detector (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI) in the Vanderbilt Center for Structural Biology or on the 21-ID-D beam line at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Phases were calculated using molecular replacement with Phaser software, which generated a unique solution when pol ι (Protein Data Bank code 2ALZ) minus DNA was used as a search model (31McCoy A.J.

Electron density maps (calculated to 2.8 Å (dCTP) and 1.9 Å (dTTP)) showed clear density around the O6-methylG lesion and both incoming dCTP and dTTP. Models were built using COOT software and refined using REFMAC5 software using TLS refinement (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The refined model converged to an Rcryst = 21.5% and Rfree = 28.3% for the dCTP-containing complex and an Rcryst = 20.8% and Rfree = 24.1% for the dTTP-containing complex. Ramachandran plots for the refined models show good stereochemistry, with 90.0 (dCTP-containing) and 92.5% (dTTP-containing) of residues in the favored regions and 0.0 (dCTP-containing) and 0.0% (dTTP-containing) in the disallowed regions.

Human pol ι incorporated (the correct) dCTP opposite template G but preferentially misincorporated dTTP opposite template O6-methylG. The ability of the pol ι catalytic core to extend a primer annealed to a G- or O6-methylG-containing DNA template was determined in a primer extension experiment with a self-complementary 18-mer oligonucleotide used as both the primer and template in the reaction (self-annealing of the oligonucleotide generated 4-base overhangs at both ends of the duplex DNA) (Fig. 1A). The results of the primer extension reaction demonstrated that pol ι incorporated nucleotides opposite template G and extended the primer by one nucleotide using this substrate (Fig. 1B). The lack of further extension is consistent with the previously demonstrated low processivity of pol ι (5Choi J.Y. Chowdhury G. Zang H. Angel K.C. Vu C.C. Peterson L.A. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Pol ι incorporated a single nucleotide opposite O6-methylG but was unable to extend from the nascent O6-methylG base pair (Fig. 1B). The 19-mer product bands ran faster in the gel when G was the template base compared with the 19-mer product bands formed using O6-methylG. This result suggests that a different incoming nucleotide was incorporated opposite G than O6-methylG. Based on primer extension experiments performed in the presence of single nucleotides, it was determined that the 19-mer product bands had dCTP incorporated opposite G and dTTP misincorporated opposite O6-methylG (data not shown). Quantification of the primer extension data demonstrated that O6-methylG inhibited extension catalyzed by pol ι compared with that using template G (Fig. 1C). The results of the primer extension experiments using the pol ι catalytic fragment (amino acids 1–420) are consistent with previous results of primer extension opposite template G and O6-methylG using full-length pol ι (amino acids 1–715) (5Choi J.Y.

To quantify more precisely the results of the primer extension experiment, steady-state kinetic analyses were performed using the pol ι catalytic fragment (Table 1). Pol ι was more efficient at misincorporation of dTTP opposite O6-methylG than correct incorporation of dCTP. Steady-state kinetic analyses using full-length enzyme show that pol ι has a ∼10-fold higher efficiency for dTTP incorporation compared with dCTP incorporation opposite O6-methylG (5Choi J.Y.

The catalytic core of pol ι was similar to the full-length enzyme and maintained a high efficiency of dTTP misincorporation opposite O6-methylG; dTTP misincorporation efficiency was ∼6-fold higher than dCTP incorporation opposite O6-methylG (Table 1). The increased efficiency of dTTP misincorporation opposite O6-methylG is mainly due to a Km effect; no changes were observed in the kcat values for dCTP or dTTP incorporation (Table 1). Thus, the different efficiencies of dCTP or dTTP incorporation opposite O6-methylG might result from binding and positioning of the nucleotide differently in the pol ι active site.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation opposite G and O6-methylG by pol ιTemplatedNTPKmkcatkcat/Kmfincafinc was calculated as (kcat/Km)incorrect/(kcat/Km)correct.μms−1s−1 mm−1O6-MethylGC1200 ± 7000.03 ± 0.0072.5 × 10−21T140 ± 600.02 ± 0.0021.4 × 10−15.6GC90 ± 100.04 ± 0.0024.4 × 10−11T860 ± 3600.01 ± 0.0031.2 × 10−20.27a finc was calculated as (kcat/Km)incorrect/(kcat/Km)correct.

Nature. 2004; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, the high efficiency of pol ι for dTTP misincorporation opposite O6-methylG may be due to dCTP and dTTP base pairing in different modes with the Hoogsteen edge of O6-methylG. To test this hypothesis, the crystal structures of pol ι:O6-methylG ternary complexes were solved with incoming dTTP or dCTP (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 2). The structural data indicate that pol ι bound O6-methylG in a ternary complex with incoming dCTP or dTTP without major changes in the protein fold or the position of specific amino acid side chains around the active site. The structures of the pol ι:O6-methylG complex were similar, regardless of whether dCTP or dTTP was the incoming nucleotide and superimpose with a root mean square deviation value of 0.34 Å (Fig. 2C). Also, the structure of the pol ι:O6-methylG complex is similar to the pol ι:G ternary complex (2ALZ), and the structures superimpose with a root mean square deviation value of 0.42 Å (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the preference of pol ι for dTTP incorporation opposite O6-methylG does not result from major conformational changes in the protein, therefore suggesting that preferential dTTP incorporation occurs as a result of differences in the base pairing of dTTP and dCTP with O6-methylG.TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionPol ι:O6-methylG with dCTPPol ι:O6-methylG with dTTP Resolution (Å)aValues for outermost shells are given in parentheses.2.8 (2.85-2.80)1.9 (1.97-1.90) No. of measured reflections255,620723,837 No. of unique reflections14,30446,192 Completeness (%)96.8 (86.7)99.8 (98.9) Redundancy17.9 (3.8)15.7 (8.8) RmergebRmerge = Σ|I − 〈I〉|ΣI, where I is the integrated intensity of a given reflection.

https://openalex.org/W2010410788,"Changes in neuronal morphology underlying neuronal differentiation depend on rapid and sustained cytoskeleton rearrangements in the growing neurites. Whereas cell adhesion molecules are well established as regulators of neuronal differentiation, less is known about the signaling mechanisms by which they influence the cytoskeleton. Here we show that the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) associates with the active form of caspase-8 and that clustering of NCAM at the neuronal cell surface leads to activation of caspase-8 and -3 followed by the cleavage of the sub-membranous brain spectrin meshwork, but not of the actin or tubulin cytoskeleton. Inhibitors of caspase-8 and -3 specifically block the NCAM-dependent spectrin cleavage and abolish NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth. NCAM-dependent rearrangements of the membrane associated spectrin meshwork via caspase-8 dependent caspase-3 activation are thus indispensable for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2140574473,"Conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes transduce the abundance of signals mediated by phospholipid hydrolysis; however redundancy in regulatory mechanisms confounds dissecting the unique signaling properties of each of the eight isozymes constituting these two subgroups. Previously, we created a genetically encoded reporter (C kinase activity reporter (CKAR)) to visualize the rate, amplitude, and duration of agonist-evoked PKC signaling at specific locations within the cell. Here we designed a reporter, δCKAR, that specifically measures the activation signature of one PKC isozyme, PKC δ, in cells, revealing unique spatial and regulatory properties of this isozyme. Specifically, we show two mechanisms of activation: 1) agonist-stimulated activation at the plasma membrane (the site of most robust PKC δ signaling), Golgi, and mitochondria that is independent of Src and can be triggered by phorbol esters and 2) agonist-stimulated activation in the nucleus that requires Src kinase activation and cannot be triggered by phorbol esters. Translocation studies reveal that the G-protein-coupled receptor agonist UTP induces the translocation of PKC δ into the nucleus by a mechanism that depends on the C2 domain and requires Src kinase activity. However, translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus is not required for the Src-dependent regulation of nuclear activity; a construct of PKC δ prelocalized to the nucleus continues to be activated by UTP by a mechanism dependent on Src kinase activity. These data identify the nucleus as a signaling hub for PKC δ that is driven by receptor-mediated signaling pathways (but not phorbol esters) and differs from signaling at plasma membrane and Golgi in that it is controlled by Src family kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2072437147,"TRPC6 is a cation channel in the plasma membrane that plays a role in Ca(2+) entry following the stimulation of a G(q)-protein coupled or tyrosine kinase receptor. A dysregulation of TRPC6 activity causes abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells and glomerulosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of TRPC6 activity by protein kinase C (PKC). We showed that inhibiting PKC with GF1 or activating it with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate potentiated and inhibited agonist-induced Ca(2+) entry, respectively, into cells expressing TRPC6. Similar results were obtained when TRPC6 was directly activated with 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Activation of the cells with carbachol increased the phosphorylation of TRPC6, an effect that was prevented by the inhibition of PKC. The target residue of PKC was identified by an alanine screen of all canonical PKC sites on TRPC6. Unexpectedly, all the mutants, including TRPC6(S768A) (a residue previously proposed to be a target for PKC), displayed PKC-dependent inhibition of channel activity. Phosphorylation prediction software suggested that Ser(448), in a non-canonical PKC consensus sequence, was a potential target for PKCδ. Ba(2+) and Ca(2+) entry experiments revealed that GF1 did not potentiate TRPC6(S448A) activity. Moreover, activation of PKC did not enhance the phosphorylation state of TRPC6(S448A). Using A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells, which endogenously express TRPC6, we observed that a novel PKC isoform is involved in the inhibition of the vasopressin-induced Ca(2+) entry. Furthermore, knocking down PKCδ in A7r5 cells potentiated vasopressin-induced Ca(2+) entry. In summary, we provide evidence that PKCδ exerts a negative feedback effect on TRPC6 through the phosphorylation of Ser(448)."
https://openalex.org/W2094680135,"Two pathways have been proposed for eukaryotic Okazaki fragment RNA primer removal. Results presented here provide evidence for an alternative pathway. Primer extension by DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) displaces the downstream fragment into an RNA-initiated flap. Most flaps are cleaved by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) while short, and the remaining nicks joined in the first pathway. A small fraction escapes immediate FEN1 cleavage and is further lengthened by Pif1 helicase. Long flaps are bound by replication protein A (RPA), which inhibits FEN1. In the second pathway, Dna2 nuclease cleaves an RPA-bound flap and displaces RPA, leaving a short flap for FEN1. Pif1 flap lengthening creates a requirement for Dna2. This relationship should not have evolved unless Pif1 had an important role in fragment processing. In this study, biochemical reconstitution experiments were used to gain insight into this role. Pif1 did not promote synthesis through GC-rich sequences, which impede strand displacement. Pif1 was also unable to open fold-back flaps that are immune to cleavage by either FEN1 or Dna2 and cannot be bound by RPA. However, Pif1 working with pol δ readily unwound a full-length Okazaki fragment initiated by a fold-back flap. Additionally, a fold-back in the template slowed pol δ synthesis, so that the fragment could be removed before ligation to the lagging strand. These results suggest an alternative pathway in which Pif1 removes Okazaki fragments initiated by fold-back flaps in vivo.

DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) then conjugates with PCNA and continues rapid and efficient extension of the primer.

Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), necessitating the second pathway.

FEN1 will then complete cleavage of the short flap, leaving a nick to be sealed by LigI. The importance of Dna2 cleavage is highlighted by the observation that Dna2 nuclease is essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17.Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

In the absence of Dna2, it is likely that long RPA-bound flaps cannot be properly processed, leading to genomic instability and cell death. Genetic evidence suggests that Pif1 helicase influences the pathway chosen for flap processing by lengthening displaced flaps. Deletion of PIF1 rescues the lethality of dna2Δ in S. cerevisiae (23.Budd M.E. Reis C.C. Smith S. Myung K. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell.

Our biochemical studies support this conclusion (11.Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Using an Okazaki fragment processing reconstitution system, we showed that in the absence of Pif1 virtually all flaps remain too short for RPA to bind. When Pif1 is included, longer flaps are created, and their cleavage is inhibited by RPA (11.Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27483-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cleavage of these flaps and ligation of the nicked intermediates requires Dna2, demonstrating that Pif1 directs flaps to the two-nuclease pathway (13.Pike J.E. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25170-25180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Additionally, Pif1 stimulates strand displacement synthesis by pol δ, further supporting the hypothesis that Pif1 binds short flaps as they are displaced and lengthens them (13.Pike J.E. Burgers P.M.

The small portion of flaps lengthened by Pif1 implies that Pif1 binds flaps that escape immediate FEN1 cleavage. The precise role Pif1 plays in Okazaki fragment processing remains unknown. If virtually all flaps are capable of being processed by the FEN1-only pathway in the absence of Pif1 (11.Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27483-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), then Pif1 activity at Okazaki fragments merely promotes inefficient energy use by requiring the action of Dna2. It is reasonable to assume that if Pif1 were not important for proper Okazaki fragment processing, evolution would have driven Pif1 to localize solely to telomeres and mitochondria, where it plays important roles in limiting telomere growth and maintaining mitochondrial DNA stability (25.Boulé J.B. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4147-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, Pif1 likely also plays a biologically important role at Okazaki fragments. We considered the possibility that Pif1 is required for efficient synthesis and flap processing at specific sequences, such as regions of high GC content or having the potential to form fold-back flaps. pol δ does not displace through a sequence of high GC content as well as through a sequence of comparatively low GC content (12.Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), presumably because stable hydrogen bonding produces an energy barrier to strand separation. We considered that helicase activity of Pif1 might permit more rapid synthesis through such sequences. Pif1 is known to efficiently unwind G-quadruplexes (26.Ribeyre C. Lopes J. Boulé J.B. Piazza A. Guédin A. Zakian V.A. Mergny J.L. Nicolas A. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000475Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), consistent with an ability to destabilize structures that might produce barriers to primer extension. Observations in vivo support this interpretation, as Pif1 is important in maintaining genomic stability at loci likely to form G-quadruplexes (26.Ribeyre C. Lopes J. Boulé J.B. Piazza A. Guédin A. Zakian V.A. Mergny J.L. Nicolas A. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000475Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We also anticipated that Pif1 would be needed for replication of sequences that have the potential to form stable fold-back flaps. Neither FEN1 nor Dna2 can cleave such flaps (20.Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). If the fold-back is relatively weak and initiated with a 5′ single-stranded tail, Dna2 helicase activity can unwind the fold-back and allow cleavage of the flap. However, if no tail is present or the structure is very stable, Dna2 will not be able to enter to affect cleavage. Additionally, RPA strand melting activity can unwind weak structure in flaps and permit Dna2 cleavage, but RPA is unable to unwind flaps with strong secondary structure (21.Stewart J.A. Miller A.S. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31356-31365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27.Bartos J.D. Willmott L.J. Binz S.K. Wold M.S. Bambara R.A. J.

Thus, flaps that form strong fold-backs, likely to occur in certain sequences such as triplet repeat regions, cannot be processed by either pathway. We considered that Pif1 might unwind such flaps and permit FEN1 cleavage, Dna2 cleavage, or RPA binding. In this study, we examined potential biologically important roles for Pif1 in Okazaki fragment processing. We first examined possible stimulation of synthesis through a GC-rich sequence. Next, we asked whether Pif1 is capable of unwinding a fold-back flap and allowing FEN1 or Dna2 to cleave or RPA to bind. Finally, we used a reconstitution system to examine the effect of Pif1 on strand displacement synthesis through an Okazaki fragment initiated with a stable fold-back flap. Our results provide evidence for an alternative Okazaki fragment-processing pathway, in which Pif1 promotes removal of an entire fragment initiated by a fold-back flap from the template DNA. Radioactive nucleotides [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or Midland Certified Reagents Co. (Midland, TX). The primers and their sequences are listed in Table 1.

Substrates composed of the oligonucleotides listed in Table 1 were designed to simulate intermediates of Okazaki fragment processing. The 5′ ends of primers U2, U3, and I1 were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. Primers D1, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, or D12 were annealed at the 3′ end to a 20-nt labeling template with a 5′-GCTA overhang and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow polymerase. The radiolabeled primers were separated by running the reactions on a 15%, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled products were then gel-purified. To anneal substrates, component oligonucleotides were mixed in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, adjusted to 70 °C, and slowly cooled to room temperature. When the upstream primer was labeled, the oligonucleotides were annealed at a 1:2:4 ratio of upstream primer to template to downstream primer. When the downstream primer was labeled, the oligonucleotides were annealed at a 1:2:4 ratio of downstream primer to template to upstream primer. When the internal primer was labeled, the oligonucleotides were annealed at a 1:2:4:4 ratio of internal primer to template to upstream primer to downstream primer. Four sets of substrates were used in the following experiments. The first set consisted of 10 fixed flap configurations that were designed to examine Pif1 helicase activity and Pif1 stimulation of FEN1 cleavage, Dna2 cleavage, and RPA binding of fixed fold-back flaps with certain structural elements. The first fixed flap substrate had a 30-nt unstructured control flap and consisted of a 71-nt upstream primer (U1) and a 70-nt downstream primer (D1) annealed to a 110-nt template (T1). This will be referred to as the 30-nt flap substrate in the text. The next three fixed flap substrates had an 18-, 15-, or 12-nt fold-back flap with a 12-nt 5′ tail and a 6-nt gap between the fold-back and the downstream annealed region. These consisted of a 71-nt upstream primer (U1) and a 100-, 94-, or 88-nt downstream primer (D4, D5, or D6, respectively) annealed to a 110-nt template (T1). In the text, these will be referred to as the 18-, 15-, and 12-nt fold-back flap substrates, respectively. The next three flap substrates were identical to the fold-back flap substrates but lacked the 6-nt gap between the fold-back and the downstream annealed region. These consisted of a 71-nt upstream primer (U1) and a 94-, 88-, or 82-nt downstream primer (D7, D8, or D9, respectively) annealed to a 110-nt template (T1). In the text, these will be referred to as the 18-, 15-, and 12-nt fold-back –G flap substrates, respectively. The final three flap substrates were identical to the fold-back flap substrates but lacked both the 12-nt 5′ tail and the 6-nt gap between the fold-back and downstream annealed region. These consisted of a 71-nt upstream primer (U1) and an 82-, 76-, or 70-nt downstream primer (D10, D11, or D12, respectively) annealed to a 110-nt template (T1). In the text, these will be referred to as the 18-, 15-, and 12-nt fold-back –G–T flap substrates, respectively. The second set of substrates was designed to examine the effect of Pif1 on pol δ strand displacement synthesis. Both substrates in this set were identical in structure but different in sequence. The first substrate consisted of a 44-nt upstream primer (U2) and a 60-nt downstream primer (D2) annealed to a 110-nt template (T1), leaving a 6-nt gap between the upstream and downstream primers. This substrate has been used in previous reconstitution experiments (11.Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27483-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13.Pike J.E. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The second substrate consisted of the same 44-nt upstream primer (U2) and a different 60-nt downstream primer (D3) annealed to a different 110-nt template (T2), also leaving a 6-nt gap between the upstream and downstream primers. This substrate will be referred to as the GC-44 substrate in the text. The downstream annealed region of the GC-44 substrate was identical in nucleotide composition to that of the standard-44 substrate but different in sequence. The first 12 nts of the GC-44 downstream annealed region were 75% GC as opposed to 50% in the standard-44 substrate. The third single-member substrate set was designed to examine strand displacement synthesis through, and cleavage and ligation of, an Okazaki fragment initiated by a pre-created 18-nt fold-back flap. The substrate consisted of a 25-nt upstream primer (U3), a 100-nt internal primer (I1), and a 30-nt downstream primer (D13) annealed to a 110-nt template (T1), forming a 2-nt gap between the upstream and internal primers and a nick between the internal and downstream primers. The internal primer approximated a full-length Okazaki fragment, and the upstream and downstream primers represent the adjacent fragments. This substrate will be referred to as the internal 18-nt fold-back substrate. The final single-member substrate set was designed to examine synthesis through a fold-back in the template DNA. The substrate consisted of a 44-nt upstream primer (U2) annealed to the 3′ end of a 110-nt template (T3). The template has an 18-nt fold-back 10 nt downstream of the upstream primer. This substrate will be referred to as the template fold-back substrate. The standard-44 substrate lacking the downstream primer was used as an unstructured control. Five fmol of radiolabeled biotinylated substrate were first incubated on ice with 500 fmol of streptavidin for 20 min. Streptavidin complexes with biotin on the template ends, blocking the substrate ends and requiring that RFC loads PCNA. For simplicity, the blocked ends are not depicted in the figures. Streptavidin-conjugated substrate was then incubated with various combinations and amounts of pol δ, PCNA, RFC, FEN1, Dna2, RPA, LigI, and Pif1 for 10 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of reconstitution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm dNTPs, 1 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, and 75 mm NaCl). Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 2× termination dye (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.01% xylene cyanole), followed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 22.5%, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel for 1 h and 30 min at 80 watts. The gel was dried and exposed to a phosphor screen, which was scanned with a GE Healthcare PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software. For the kinetic experiment shown in Fig. 5, the reactions were initiated in a total of 120 μl of reconstitution buffer and at given time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min), a 20-μl sample was removed from each reaction, added to 20 μl of 2× termination dye, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Products were then separated by electrophoresis and analyzed as described above. For the strand displacement-coupled cleavage assay shown in Fig. 4A, reactions were run and analyzed as described above. For fixed fold-back flap cleavage assays, 5 fmol of radiolabeled substrate were incubated with either FEN1 or Dna2 and various amounts of Pif1 for 10 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of reaction buffer (same as reconstitution buffer described above but without dNTPs). Reactions were stopped, separated by electrophoresis, and analyzed as described above. Five fmol of radiolabeled substrate were incubated with RPA and various amounts of Pif1 for 10 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of reaction buffer. Reaction samples were loaded onto a 12% native polyacrylamide gel, and products were separated by electrophoresis for 2 h at 250 V. The gel was dried, scanned, and analyzed as described above. Five fmol of radiolabeled substrate were incubated with either various amounts of Pif1 or pol δ, PCNA, and RFC with increasing amounts of Pif1 for 10 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of reaction buffer. Reactions were stopped by adding 4 μl of 6× helicase dye (50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.125% bromphenol blue, and 0.125% xylene cyanole). Reactions to be boiled were further incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. Reaction samples were loaded onto a 12% native polyacrylamide gel, and products were separated by electrophoresis for 2 h at 250 V. The gel was dried, scanned, and analyzed as described above. The amount of each protein used in each experiment is given in the corresponding figure legend. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and a representative gel is shown in the corresponding figure. Our goal in this study was to determine whether there are specific substrate structures on which Pif1 promotes Okazaki fragment processing. One possibility was that Pif1 stimulation of synthesis is necessary for rapid and efficient synthesis through GC-rich sequences, as these sequences inhibit strand displacement by pol δ (12.Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore examined Pif1 stimulation of synthesis using a reconstitution substrate with a relatively GC-rich region at the 5′ end of the downstream primer, the GC-44 substrate (Fig. 1). The standard-44 substrate served as a control. The first 12 nt of the downstream primer of the GC-44 substrate were 75% G or C, and they were 50% G or C in the standard-44 substrate. As expected, Pif1 stimulated full-length synthesis with the standard-44 substrate (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8). Stimulation of synthesis by FEN1 was greatly reduced on the GC-44 substrate (Fig. 1, lane 13 compared with lane 5), as observed previously (12.Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pif1 did not stimulate full-length synthesis with the GC-44 substrate (Fig. 1, lanes 14–16). This suggests that Pif1 does not stimulate synthesis through sequences of stable structure even though it has been shown to unwind stable G-rich structures, such as G-quadruplexes (26.Ribeyre C. Lopes J. Boulé J.B. Piazza A. Guédin A. Zakian V.A. Mergny J.L. Nicolas A. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000475Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Another possibility was that Pif1 activity is required for proper processing of fold-back flaps. Triplet repeats, especially CTG repeats, are particularly prone to form such structures (20.Kao H.I.

Fold-back flaps present a challenge to the flap-processing pathways. Neither FEN1 nor Dna2 can cleave a fold-back (20.Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally, RPA does not bind double-stranded DNA. Therefore, fold-back flaps are inert to all of the components of either flap-processing pathway. As a 5′–3′ helicase, Pif1 would appe"

Identifying pathogenic genes can shed light on pathogenesis underlying the interaction between F. graminearum and its plant host. However, it is difficult to detect pathogenic genes for this destructive pathogen by time-consuming and expensive molecular biological experiments in lab. On the other hand, computational methods provide an alternative way to solve this problem. Since pathogenesis is a complicated procedure that involves complex regulations and interactions, the molecular interaction network of F. graminearum can give clues to potential pathogenic genes. Furthermore, the gene expression data of F. graminearum before and after its invasion into plant host can also provide useful information. In this paper, a novel systems biology approach is presented to predict pathogenic genes of F. graminearum based on molecular interaction network and gene expression data. With a small number of known pathogenic genes as seed genes, a subnetwork that consists of potential pathogenic genes is identified from the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) of F. graminearum, where the genes in the subnetwork are further required to be differentially expressed before and after the invasion of the pathogenic fungus. Therefore, the candidate genes in the subnetwork are expected to be involved in the same biological processes as seed genes, which imply that they are potential pathogenic genes. The prediction results show that most of the pathogenic genes of F. graminearum are enriched in two important signal transduction pathways, including G protein coupled receptor pathway and MAPK signaling pathway, which are known related to pathogenesis in other fungi. In addition, several pathogenic genes predicted by our method are verified in other pathogenic fungi, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results presented in this paper not only can provide guidelines for future experimental verification, but also shed light on the pathogenesis of the destructive fungus F. graminearum."

In the present study we have investigated the role of carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) Ser/Thr residues and acidic amino acids in regulating receptor internalization, arrestin interaction, and recycling by fluorescence microscopy, cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in several cell lines. Strikingly, C-terminal truncation mutants revealed two different internalization motifs.

In this work, we investigated the role of innate immune receptors in the recognition of P. boydii. Macrophages responded to P. boydii conidia and hyphae with secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.

Dis. 1993; 167: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Strong risk factors for the development of invasive fungal infections are therapy with corticoids, cytotoxic chemotherapy, transplant followed by immunosuppressive therapy, and TNF neutralization (2Baddley J.W.

Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar). Mammalian TLRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, for example, lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria, bacterial lipoproteins, flagellin, and viral and bacterial non-methylated CpG motifs are recognized, respectively, by TLR4, TLR2, TLR5, and TLR9 (7Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6517) Google Scholar). TLRs also have been implicated in the recognition and triggering of immunity during fungal infections in mammals (9Netea M.G. Van der Graaf C. Van der Meer J.W. Kullberg B.J. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2004; 23: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Levitz S.M. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000758Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TLR2 and TLR4 mediate cytokine release and NFκB activation in response to different developmental stages of A. fumigatus (11Mambula S.S. Sau K. Henneke P. Golenbock D.T. Levitz S.M. J. Biol.

The relevance of TLR2 and TLR4 for the recognition of these important fungal pathogens is demonstrated by the observations that Tlr2−/− and Tlr4−/− mice show a higher susceptibility to C. albicans and A. fumigatus infections (14Netea M.G.

Toll-like receptors myeloid differentiation protein-88 (S)-(2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2RS)-propyl)-N-palmitoyl-(R)-Cys-(S)-Ser(S)-Lys(4)-OH, trihydrochloride. Pseudallescheria boydii is a saprophytic fungus, extremely widespread in the environment, that presents different developmental stages (19O'Bryan T.A. Expert Rev. Anti-infect. Ther. 2005; 3: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Cortez K.J. Roilides E. Quiroz-Telles F. Meletiadis J. Antachopoulos C. Knudsen T. Buchanan W. Milanovich J. Sutton D.A.

Hyphal forms of P. boydii grow as branching septated structures producing structures of dispersion, the conidia. P. boydii infections present a large spectrum of manifestations varying from localized mycetomas, sinusitis, and pulmonary infections to disseminated infections, especially in immunodeficient patients. P. boydii is one of the most common pathogenic fungi that cause mycetoma, whose incidence extends from subtropical to temperate areas. This infection is a major cause of morbidity, particularly in rural areas, where treatment and diagnosis of infections are extremely difficult (19O'Bryan T.A. Expert Rev. Anti-infect. Ther. 2005; 3: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Cortez K.J. Roilides E. Quiroz-Telles F. Meletiadis J. Antachopoulos C. Knudsen T. Buchanan W. Milanovich J. Sutton D.A.

In the absence of an adequate clearance by phagocytic cells, P. boydii conidia that have reached deep tissues can differentiate in hyphal forms and promote tissue dissemination. Although innate immunity clearly plays an essential role in resistance against P. boydii infection, the mechanisms of recognition of this pathogen by the innate immune cells are largely uncharacterized (21Roilides E. Simitsopoulou M. Katragkou A. Walsh T.J. Med. Mycol. 2009; 47: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have recently observed that highly purified α-glucan from P. boydii activates macrophages and dendritic cells through TLR2, thus indicating a role for TLRs on P. boydii recognition (22Bittencourt V.C. Figueiredo R.T. da Silva R.B. Mourão-Sá D.S. Fernandez P.L. Sassaki G.L. Mulloy B. Bozza M.T. Barreto-Bergter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22614-22623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this work we investigated the role of innate immune receptors on recognition of P. boydii developmental forms. We provide evidence that P. boydii conidia are recognized by TLR4, our results also suggest that rhamnomannans isolated from this fungus induce macrophage activation through TLR4 signaling. C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice were obtained from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro Breeding Unit (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Tlr4−/−, Tlr2−/−, Cd14−/−, and Myd88−/− on a C57BL/6 background were provided by Drs. Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Japan), Douglas Golenbock (University of Massachusetts), and Ricardo Gazzinelli (UFMG, Brazil). The animals were kept at constant temperature (25 °C) with free access to chow and water in a room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee. LPS O111:B4 from Escherichia coli was obtained from Sigma. Bacterial lipoprotein, Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam3Cys), was obtained from EMC collections. Polymixin B was purchased from Bedford Laboratories. RPMI medium for macrophage culture was obtained from Sigma and was supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). P. boydii strain HLPB, isolated from eumycotic mycetoma, was kindly supplied by Bodo Wanke from Evandro Chagas Hospital, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The P. boydii identity was confirmed by sequencing performed by Dr. Kathrin Tintelnot (Robert Koch-Institut, Berlin, Germany). The sequencing of the ITS regions revealed that this strain belongs to clade 4 (Scedosporium apiospermum sensu stricto) according to the taxonomy proposed by Gilgado et al. (23Gilgado F. Cano J. Gené J. Guarro J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 4930-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on Sabouraud solid slants, inoculated in liquid culture medium, and incubated for 7 days at 25 °C with shaking. Cultures were then transferred to the same medium and incubated for 7 days at the same temperature with shaking; the mycelium was filtered, washed with distilled water, and stored at −20 °C. Conidial forms of P. boydii were grown on agar-Sabouraud for 7 days. The culture plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and filtered through sterile gauze to remove hyphae fragments and debris. Conidial suspensions were counted in a hemocytometer, washed three times with apyrogenic saline, and heat killed at 115 °C for 15 min. For the extraction of peptidopolysaccharides, P. boydii conidia were extracted with 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 100 °C for 2 h. Conidia were recovered by centrifugation at 1160 × g for 5 min, washed three times with apyrogenic saline, and counted in a hemocytometer. P. boydii mycelia was washed three times with saline apyrogenic, and then hyphal fragments were prepared by mechanical disruption and sonication of mycelia for 10 min, amounts of hyphae employed in the experiments were normalized by wet weight. For inactivating the hyphae, stock preparations of hyphae were heat killed at 115 °C for 15 min. Because hyphal preparations constitute extremely heterogeneous suspensions with filaments varying greatly in morphology and length, the experiments of macrophage stimulation were performed taking into account the wet weight of hyphal suspensions. P. boydii mycelia (120 g) were submitted to an alkaline extraction (KOH 2% w/v, 2 h, 100 °C), then neutralized with glacial acetic acid and centrifuged, polysaccharides in supernatant were precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol, suspended in distilled water, dialyzed, and lyophilized. Polysaccharides were then fractionated by gel filtration in a Superdex 200 column (30 cm x 10 cm), previously equilibrated, and fractions were eluted in a sodium phosphate buffer (0.01 m, pH 7.0) with 0.15 m NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a FPLC system with a ÄKTA device (GE Healthcare). Eluted fractions were monitored by A280 for protein and colorimetrically (A490) for carbohydrate (24Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Swith E. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39438) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the polysaccharide were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. Neutral carbohydrates were determined by the phenol/sulfuric acid method (24Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Swith E. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39438) Google Scholar), protein was determined by the Lowry method (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphate by the procedure of Ames (26Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3000) Google Scholar), and hexosamines by the method of Belcher et al. (27Belcher R.A. Nutten A.J. Sambrook C.M. Analyst. 1954; 79: 201-208Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Partial acid hydrolysis was performed by the treatment of rhamnomannans (2 mg) with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1 m TFA at 100 °C for 20 min), degraded rhamnomannans were then dialyzed against distilled water and then lyophilized. Peptidorhamnomannans (5 mg) was chemically de-O-glycosylated by mild reductive alkaline treatment under reducing conditions, and the liberated O-linked oligosaccharide alditol fraction was recovered on dialysis (28Leitao E.A. Bittencourt V.C. Haido R.M. Valente A.P. Peter-Katalinic J. Letzel M. de Souza L.M. Barreto-Bergter E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For qualitative analysis of carbohydrates, fractions were hydrolyzed with TFA (3 m, 100 °C, 3 h), and samples were analyzed by high performance TLC, in comparison to a standard mix of known sugars (25 μg/μl). High performance TLC plates were treated with 0.3 m KH2PO4, dried at room temperature, developed two times in 1-butanol/acetone/H2O (4:5:1, v/v/v) and stained with orcinol/sulfuric acid. To quantify the carbohydrates, the hydrolyzed polysaccharide was reduced with NaBH4 for 1 h, neutralized with glacial acetic acid, and acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine (1:1, v/v) for 1 h at 100 °C. The resulting alditol acetates were examined by GC using a capillary column of DB-225 (25 m × 0.22 mm) at a temperature of 170–210 °C with a variation of 20 °C/min. For NMR experiments, the samples were deuterium exchanged by repeated dissolution in D2O and freeze drying. Spectra were obtained from solutions in D2O at 30 °C, using sodium-3-trimethylsilyl propionate as standard (δ = 0). All spectra were obtained with a Bruker 400 MHz AVANCE III NMR spectrometer with a 5-mm inverse gradient probe. Signal assignments in the one-dimensional 1H (zgpr) and 13C NMR (zgpg decoupled) spectra were carried out using edited HSQC (hsqcedetgp), COSY (cosygpprqf), and TOCSY (mlevphpr.2) programs. The two-dimensional experiments were recorded for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension, COSY spectra were acquired using 8 scans per series of 2 K × 256 W data points, and two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were acquired using 16 scans per series of 2 × 512 W data points, edited HSQC, COSY, and TOCSY spectra were acquired using 8, 4, and 8 scans, respectively, per series of 2 K × 512 W data points with zero filling in F1 (4 K) prior to Fourier transformation. Elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained by intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 3% sterile thioglycollate (Sigma). After 4 days, mice were sacrificed; peritoneal cells were harvested with chilled Hanks' balanced salt solution and plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well, in 96-well plates. Non-adherent cells were washed and macrophages were cultured in RPMI medium for the stimulation. For the culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages, bone marrow cells were harvested from murine femur and tibia, and cultured in RPMI, FCS (20%), L929 supernatant (30%), antibiotics, and β-marcaptoethanol. After 3 days, medium was exchanged, and on the sixth day, cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates. The following day, differentiated macrophages were stimulated. Macrophages were stimulated with live conidia, inactivated hyphae, or heat-killed conidia, as indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments, LPS and Pam3Cys were included in the stimuli as positive controls for TLR4 and TLR2 activation, respectively. Polymixin B (10 μg/ml) was included in the stimuli with conidia and hyphae to exclude possible endotoxin contamination. Stimulations were also performed in the absence of polymixin B with similar results. IL-6, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-12p40, and IL-10 ELISA were obtained from R&D Systems and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, the TNF ELISA was obtained from Peprotech and performed following the manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, elicited peritoneal macrophages were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/well, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with medium, and adherent cells were stimulated as indicated in the figure legends. After 15, 30, or 60 min, cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of Tris-HCl (50 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Nonidet P-40 (1%), sodium deoxycholate (0.25%), EDTA (1 mm), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin (5 μg/ml), PMSF (1 mm), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), and NaF (1 mm), pH 7.5. Cell lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were boiled and subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) in reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C for 2 h. Then the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline solution with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% fat-free milk. The membranes were incubated overnight with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1/1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-phospho-p38 (1/1000) (Cell Signaling), diluted in blocking solution. The membranes were washed in TBS-T and incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1/5000) or goat anti-mouse (1/5000) IgG polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The bands were revealed by chemiluminescence, using ECL substrate. The normalization of MAPK phosphorylation was performed by stripping membranes during 30 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer (β-mercaptoethanol 100 mm, SDS 2%, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7). After stripping, membranes were washed with TBS-T, blocked with 5% fat-free milk TBS-T, incubated with rabbit anti-ERK2 (1/1000) overnight, and detected as described above. The degradation of IκB protein was analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal rabbit anti-IκB (Sigma) diluted (1/1000) in block solution. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Results were analyzed using a statistical software package (GraphPad Prism 4). Statistical differences among the experimental groups were evaluated by means of Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were regarded as significant. The mechanisms by which the innate immune system recognizes P. boydii, as well the induction of cytokines by the morphological stages of this fungus, are unknown. Thus to evaluate macrophage activation by P. boydii, macrophages were stimulated with live conidia, the developmental form responsible for initiating host colonization (19O'Bryan T.A. Expert Rev. Anti-infect. Ther. 2005; 3: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Cortez K.J. Roilides E. Quiroz-Telles F. Meletiadis J. Antachopoulos C. Knudsen T. Buchanan W. Milanovich J.

Katragkou A. Walsh T.J. Med. Mycol. 2009; 47: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). P. boydii live conidia induced the secretion of substantial amounts of TNF, IL-12, IP-10/CXCL10, and IL-10, but low amounts of IL-6 (Fig. 1A). Filamentous fungal pathogens present different developmental phases, such as conidia and hyphae, and the morphological transition promotes a distinct recognition of these fungal structures, which induce different leukocyte responses (13Netea M.G. Warris A. Van der Meer J.W. Fenton M.J. Verver-Janssen T.J. Jacobs L.E. Andresen T. Verweij P.E. Kullberg B.J. J. Infect.

During stimulation of macrophages with P. boydii live conidia, these fungal structures differentiated into hyphae. Thus, to investigate the differential recognition of P. boydii conidia and hyphae by macrophages, resting heat-inactivated conidia and hyphae were used. Stimulation of macrophages with hyphae and heat-killed conidia resulted in cytokine induction, with hyphae inducing a maximal TNF and IL-6 release at 5 mg/ml (no IL-10 release), whereas heat-killed conidia were more effective at 5 conidia per macrophage and induced TNF, IL-10, IL-6, and IP-10/CXCL10 release (Fig. 1B and data not shown). To evaluate if conidia viability affected macrophage activation, peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with these two conidial preparations. Induction of TNF secretion by heat-killed conidia was similar to that of live conidia (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the same pattern of cytokine induction was obtained by conidia inactivated with thimerosal and heat-killed conidia, which also stimulated TNF production from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and human macrophages (data not shown). These results indicate that recognition of P. boydii conidia, and hyphae, induce a strong activation of macrophages. Activation of NFκB and MAP kinases is essential for TNF production induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (7Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6517) Google Scholar). To determine involvement of the NFκB pathway in macrophage activation by P. boydii conidia, we characterized the content of IκBα by Western blot. Heat-killed conidia, LPS (a TLR4 ligand), and Pam3Cys (a TLR2 ligand) induced degradation of IκBα, indicating activation of the NFκB signaling pathway (Fig. 2A). Activation of macrophages by pathogen-associated molecular patterns also cause the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 (1Beck-Sagué C. Jarvis W.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The stimulation of macrophages by P. boydii, LPS, and Pam3Cys caused the phosphorylation of these MAPKs (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that P. boydii conidia induced the activation of MAP kinases and NFκB signaling pathways. TLRs perform pathogen recognition and are essential to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators and the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. TLRs signal through a conserved pathway that employs TIR domain containing adaptor molecules. MyD88 is an adaptor protein that contains a TIR domain and is essential to the signaling of TLRs, with the exception of TLR3 (7Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6517) Google Scholar). Thus, to evaluate a possible role of TLRs in the recognition of P. boydii conidia by macrophages, we stimulated peritoneal macrophages obtained from wild-type (WT) and Myd88−/− mice with heat-killed conidia. Macrophages from Myd88−/− mice were unable to release TNF in response to the stimuli with heat-killed conidia or LPS (Fig. 3A). These results indicate a role for one or more TLRs in the recognition of P. boydii conidia. TLR2 and TLR4 were pointed out as receptors involved in the recognition of fungal pathogens (11Mambula S.S.

P. boydii conidia-induced IL-10 and IP-10/CXCL10 secretion were also dependent on TLR4 signaling (data not shown). In contrast, Tlr2−/− macrophages showed a similar TNF release in response to activation with heat-killed conidia, when compared with WT macrophages (Fig. 3B). The secretion of TNF and IL-6 induced by P. boydii hyphae was independent of both TLR4 and TLR2 signaling (Fig. 3B). As positive controls to TLR4 and TLR2 activation, we employed LPS and Pam3Cys, respectively. Stimulations with heat-killed P. boydii conidia and hyphae were performed in the presence of polymyxin B, in a concentration able to completely neutralize LPS in a concentration as high as 100 ng/ml. Stimulations with conidia performed in the absence or presence of polymyxin B gave similar results (Fig. 3B and data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2143137881,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of lipoxin A4, an anti-inflammatory and proresolution modulator, during human parturition. We measured serum levels of lipoxin A4 and myome-trial protein release using ELISA, quantified lipoxin receptor (FPR2/ALX) mRNA expression using qRT-PCR, and localized protein expression using immuno-histochemstry in myometrial biopsies from pregnant women. In addition, we compared the effects of lipoxin A4 (100 nM) with vehicle on basal and LPS-stimulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines from samples of myometrium from pregnant women. Mean ± se circulating level of lipoxin A4 was 5.89 ± 0.63 nM at 24-wk gestation, with a further modest increase during pregnancy (P<0.05), but no differences in gestation matched women before and after labor (P>0.05). Levels of lipoxin A4 in nonpregnant women were 0.48 ± 0.04 nM, significantly lower than in pregnant women (P<0.001).

https://openalex.org/W2170865876,"Background Enterococcus faecalis is a significant cause of infective endocarditis, an infection of the heart endothelium leading to vegetation formation (microbes, fibrin, platelets, and host cells attached to underlying endothelial tissue). Our previous research determined that enterococcal aggregation substance (AS) is an important virulence factor in causation of endocarditis, although endocarditis may occur in the absence of AS production. Production of AS by E. faecalis causes the organism to form aggregates through AS binding to enterococcal binding substance. In this study, we assessed the ability of IgGs and IgG Fabs against AS to provide protection against AS+ E. faecalis endocarditis. Methodology/Principal Findings When challenged with AS+ E. faecalis, 10 rabbits actively immunized against AS+ E. faecalis developed more significant vegetations than 9 animals immunized against AS− E. faecalis, and 9/10 succumbed compared to 2/9 (p<0.005), suggesting enhanced aggregation by IgG contributes significantly to disease. IgG antibodies against AS also enhanced enterococcal aggregation as tested in vitro. In contrast, Fab fragments of IgG from rabbits immunized against purified AS, when passively administered to rabbits (6/group) immediately before challenge with AS+ E. faecalis, reduced total vegetation (endocarditis lesion) microbial counts (7.9×106 versus 2.0×105, p = 0.02) and size (40 mg versus 10, p = 0.05). In vitro, the Fabs prevented enterococcal aggregation. Conclusions/Significance The data confirm the role of AS in infective endocarditis formation and suggest that use of Fabs against AS will provide partial protection from AS+ E. faecalis illness."
https://openalex.org/W1998533420,"The CD300 family of myeloid immunoglobulin receptors includes activating (CD300b, CD300e) and inhibitory members (CD300a, CD300f), as well as molecules of uncertain function presenting a negative charge within their transmembrane domain (CD300c, CD300d). In this paper, we establish that CD300c is a functional immune receptor able to deliver activating signals upon ligation in RBL-2H3 mast cells. CD300c signaling is partially mediated by a direct association with the immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing adaptor FcεRγ. The existence of complementary transmembrane-charged residues in certain CD300 receptors suggested the formation of heterodimers within this family. Indeed, we proved the interaction between CD300b and CD300c in transfected COS-7 cells and demonstrated that it has important functional consequences. Unexpectedly, dimmer formation was dependent on the immunoglobulin domains rather than the charged transmembrane residues. Concordantly, all CD300 members were found to interact with each other, even with themselves, forming both homo- and heterodimers. We found that the combination of CD300 receptors in a complex differentially modulates the signaling outcome, strongly suggesting a new mechanism by which CD300 complexes could regulate the activation of myeloid cells upon interaction with their natural ligands."

Progranulin (PGRN) is postulated to play a critical role in regulating pathological liver growth. Nevertheless, the exact regulatory mechanism of PGRN in relation to its functional role in embryonic liver development remains to be elucidated.

IntroductionThe liver is the largest essential internal organ and has a number of vital functions in the body. The liver parenchyma is largely constituted of hepatocytes (∼80%), and the remaining cells include cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells (1Blouin A. Bolender R.P. Weibel E.R. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 72: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Liver organogenesis is initiated in the endodermal cells of the ventral foregut, which develop competence from the cardiac mesoderm to form hepatoblasts. During the specification stages, the specified hepatoblasts form a liver bud and undergo the hepatic outgrowth process. Hepatic outgrowth is characterized by a large change in the liver bud size that is caused by the rapid proliferation of hepatoblasts. Finally, the hepatoblasts differentiate into functional hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (2Duncan S.A. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 3Zaret K.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In studies using chicks and mice, liver organogenesis has been shown to be tightly regulated by growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors. However, little is known about the genetic requirements of the liver growth process and its regulatory mechanism. The use of knock-out mice has led to the discovery of several genes that are critical for hepatic outgrowth. An example of these critical genes is the met gene that encodes the hepatocyte growth factor receptor that regulates cell migration, proliferation, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis (4Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). A knock-out of the met gene in mice results in early embryonic lethality and a reduced liver size in utero (5Bladt F. Riethmacher D. Isenmann S. Aguzzi A. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 376: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). In addition, growth hormone has been shown to be a liver growth-promoting factor (6Palmiter R.D. Norstedt G. Gelinas R.E. Hammer R.E. Brinster R.L. Science. 1983; 222: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To investigate novel regulatory factors involved in liver growth, a subtractive hybridization in conjunction with growth hormone administration was performed. This hybridization led to the identification of progranulin (PGRN) 2The abbreviations used are: PGRNprogranulinHCChepatocellular carcinomahpfhours post-fertilizationMOmorpholinoWISHwhole-mount in situ hybridizationPH3phosphohistone H3PCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigendpfdays post-fertilizationEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. as a novel growth hormone-regulated growth factor in the liver (7Chen M.H.

Endocrinol. 2007; 150: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).PGRN, also known as epithelin/granulin precursor, acrogranin, proepithelin, and PC cell-derived growth factor, is a pleiotropic autocrine growth factor that contributes to early embryogenesis, the wound healing response, frontotemporal dementia, and tumorigenesis (8He Z. Bateman A. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 9Ong C.H. Bateman A. Histol. Histopathol. 2003; 18: 1275-1288PubMed Google Scholar). PGRN is an extracellular glycoprotein that consists of multiple copies of the cysteine-rich granulin motif. Elevated PGRN levels often occur in patients with cancer, and epidemiological studies show that PGRN is overexpressed in 70% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Overexpression of PGRN promotes the growth and invasion of HCC cells (10Cheung S.T. Wong S.Y. Leung K.L. Chen X. So S. Ng I.O. Fan S.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 7629-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Treatment with a PGRN monoclonal antibody has been shown to block the established HCC tumor growth in a mouse xenotransplantation model (11Ho J.C. Ip Y.C. Cheung S.T. Lee Y.T. Chan K.F. Wong S.Y. Fan S.T. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1524-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which suggests that PGRN is involved in regulating pathological hepatocyte growth. Although the dysregulation of embryonic hepatogenesis signaling has been shown to be associated with hepatocarcinogenesis (12Breuhahn K. Longerich T. Schirmacher P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3787-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the physiological role of PGRN in hepatogenesis remains unclear.Zebrafish are an ideal model for studying the physiological role of PGRN in hepatogenesis because early stages of liver organogenesis in zebrafish are similar to those observed in mice (13Chu J. Sadler K.C. Hepatology. 2009; 50: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). There are four PGRN genes (grnA, grnB, grn1, and grn2) in the zebrafish genome, whereas only one gene encodes PGRN in mammals. According to the syntenic conservation of chromosomal localization, grnA is the orthologue of the mammalian PGRN gene. In zebrafish, the expression of grnA has been observed in the anterior endoderm and the liver primordium from 24 to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf) (14Cadieux B. Chitramuthu B.P. Baranowski D. Bennett H.P. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which suggests that grnA might contribute to liver development. In the present study, we knocked down GrnA expression using morpholinos (MOs), which resulted in a small liver phenotype in zebrafish. According to the whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis, we determined that the morphological defect was caused by an impaired hepatic outgrowth. Furthermore, a microarray approach combined with in vitro and in vivo examinations revealed that GrnA was an upstream factor of MET signaling in liver growth. Taken together, our findings indicate that GrnA is essential for embryonic liver morphogenesis. In addition, our findings also indicate a possible relationship between PGRN and MET signaling.DISCUSSIONThe dysregulation of embryonic growth factors, receptors, and their downstream signaling components in adulthood has been shown to promote HCC proliferation and invasiveness (12Breuhahn K. Longerich T. Schirmacher P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3787-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although PGRN has been shown to be involved in HCC progression, the functional role of PGRN in embryonic live organogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, we addressed two major issues. First, we assessed whether PGRN is involved in embryonic liver development. Second, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of PGRN in the regulation of liver growth. To study the genetic requirement of PGRN in embryonic liver development, we inhibited PGRN by antisense morpholino knockdown of the PGRN orthologue grnA in zebrafish. The Tg(fabp10:EGFP) model showed that GrnA knockdown led to a reduced liver size, which was verified using confocal imaging and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 and Table 1). This reduction suggests that GrnA is required for liver morphogenesis in zebrafish. An important issue is whether GrnA is specific for liver morphogenesis. PGRN is maternally deposited and then expressed zygotically in a number of epithelial cells, including the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and immune cells (36Daniel R. Daniels E. He Z. Bateman A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition to the liver, our analysis revealed that GrnA affected the development of several tissues, including the pancreas and blood cells (Fig. 3 and data not shown). It is possible that grnA is widely expressed in many tissues in the zebrafish embryo (14Cadieux B. Chitramuthu B.P. Baranowski D. Bennett H.P. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); therefore, its expression is required for the development of various tissues. However, during embryonic development, the liver is much more sensitive to a GrnA deficiency compared with other endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm-derived tissues (Fig. 3). This sensitivity indicates that GrnA plays a crucial role in liver organogenesis. Furthermore, we applied established WISH markers to frame the developmental stages that were affected by grnA knockdown and that led to impaired liver morphogenesis. At 24 hpf, the expression of hhex and prox1 led to normal liver bud formation, which suggested that specification was not disrupted in the grnA morphants. In contrast, our WISH results showed that hepatic outgrowth had been attenuated early with respect to the expression of ceruloplasmin from 40 hpf (data not shown) and foxA3 at 50 hpf (Fig. 7B). The expression of hhex, prox1, fabp10, foxA3, and cebpb in 72- and 96-hpf grnA morphants might have also led to the defective hepatic outgrowth observed in grnA morphants. Therefore, we conclude that GrnA is required for hepatic outgrowth rather than for specification in zebrafish. Numerous genes have been identified that are required for outgrowth, and it has been demonstrated that a loss of the expression of these genes decreases hepatic proliferation and leads to apoptosis (37Bonnard M. Mirtsos C. Suzuki S. Graham K. Huang J. Ng M. Itié A. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Henzel W.J. Elia A.J. Shillinglaw W. Mak T.W. Cao Z. Yeh W.C.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3222-3229PubMed Google Scholar, 42He Z. Ismail A. Kriazhev L. Sadvakassova G. Bateman A.

Hayashi J. Serrero G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The present work is the first to show that PGRN is involved in embryonic liver growth regulation. A loss of GrnA expression led to impaired proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in zebrafish embryos (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, the reduction of PGRN protein has been shown to suppress HCC proliferation in a nude mouse xenotransplantation model (10Cheung S.T. Wong S.Y. Leung K.L. Chen X. So S. Ng I.O. Fan S.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 7629-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Ho J.C. Ip Y.C. Cheung S.T. Lee Y.T. Chan K.F. Wong S.Y. Fan S.T. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1524-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which suggests a relevant regulatory mechanism of PGRN in HCC proliferation and embryonic liver growth. Besides, recent reports showed that the PGRN knock-out mice display behavioral abnormalities and dysregulated inflammation and neuropathology (46Kayasuga Y. Chiba S. Suzuki M. Kikusui T. Matsuwaki T.

F., Nathan, C., Thomas, B., Ding, A. (2010) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar). In contrast to our results shown in 4 dpf grnA knockdown zebrafish (Table 1), the ratio of liver weight over whole body weight is normal in the 2-month-old PGRN knock-out mice (47Yin F. Banerjee R.

However, the detail examination remains to be seen whether the liver development is impaired in these animals. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in GrnA-regulated liver growth, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis, which showed that GrnA modulated the expression of met and other related genes. During embryogenesis, Met and its ligand, the scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor, play crucial roles in regulating liver development (49Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W.

Dyn. 2008; 237: 3904-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, dysregulation of the MET signaling pathway promotes invasive growth and initiates metastasis during tumorigenesis (51Suzuki K. Hayashi N. Yamada Y. Yoshihara H. Miyamoto Y. Ito Y. Ito T.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5126-5128PubMed Google Scholar), and MET is also known to induce β-catenin phosphorylation and accumulation (29Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Miagkov A. Skeel A. Nakaigawa N. Zbar B. Leonard E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5857-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In our model, GrnA-regulated mRNA expression of yb1, ctnnb1, and other MET related genes were confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6A). GrnA also regulated met and β-catenin expression by Western blotting and WISH analyses (Fig. 8). Furthermore, β-catenin belongs to the Wnt signaling pathway and has been shown to regulate liver growth (58Apte U. Zeng G. Thompson M.D. Muller P. Micsenyi A. Cieply B. Kaestner K.H. Monga S.P. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G1578-G1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which suggests that Wnt signaling might also be of relevance and that extensive cellular pathways are affected by the knockdown of GrnA. Hence, it may explain why the met mRNA could not fully rescue the grnA morphant phenotype (Fig. 7, D and J). In rescue experiments, we found that a co-injection of met mRNA with grnA MO could restore the impaired liver growth caused by grnA MO administration; in contrast, grnA mRNA did not rescue the liver size resulting from the knockdown of MET (Fig. 7, F and L). Our results indicate that GrnA might serve as an upstream regulator of MET to regulate embryonic liver growth.Taken together, we demonstrate that zebrafish grnA is required for embryonic hepatic outgrowth, and that GrnA acts, at least partially, through MET signaling to regulate embryonic liver growth. Additionally, we provide a model that could be used to study both genetic and functional factors that are involved in embryonic liver morphogenesis. Because the PGRN receptor and downstream effectors have not yet been identified (59Lai A.Z. Abella J.V. Park M. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 542-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 60Xia X. Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although the dysregulation of embryonic hepatogenesis signaling has been shown to be associated with hepatocarcinogenesis (12Breuhahn K. Longerich T. Schirmacher P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3787-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the physiological role of PGRN in hepatogenesis remains unclear.Zebrafish are an ideal model for studying the physiological role of PGRN in hepatogenesis because early stages of liver organogenesis in zebrafish are similar to those observed in mice (13Chu J. Sadler K.C. Hepatology. 2009; 50: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). There are four PGRN genes (grnA, grnB, grn1, and grn2) in the zebrafish genome, whereas only one gene encodes PGRN in mammals. According to the syntenic conservation of chromosomal localization, grnA is the orthologue of the mammalian PGRN gene. In zebrafish, the expression of grnA has been observed in the anterior endoderm and the liver primordium from 24 to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf) (14Cadieux B. Chitramuthu B.P. Baranowski D. Bennett H.P. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which suggests that grnA might contribute to liver development. In the present study, we knocked down GrnA expression using morpholinos (MOs), which resulted in a small liver phenotype in zebrafish. According to the whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis, we determined that the morphological defect was caused by an impaired hepatic outgrowth. Furthermore, a microarray approach combined with in vitro and in vivo examinations revealed that GrnA was an upstream factor of MET signaling in liver growth. Taken together, our findings indicate that GrnA is essential for embryonic liver morphogenesis. In addition, our findings also indicate a possible relationship between PGRN and MET signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1977509327,"High mobility group A1 (HMGA1) proteins belong to a group of architectural transcription factors that are overexpressed in a range of human malignancies, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They promote anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition and are therefore suggested as potential therapeutic targets. Employing in vitro selection techniques against a chosen fragment of HMGA1, we have generated biostable l-RNA oligonucleotides, so-called Spiegelmers, that specifically bind HMGA1b with low nanomolar affinity. We demonstrate that the best binding Spiegelmers, NOX-A50 and NOX-f33, compete HMGA1b from binding to its natural binding partner, AT-rich double-stranded DNA. We describe a formulation method based on polyplex formation with branched polyethylenimine for efficient delivery of polyethylene glycol-modified Spiegelmers and show improved tissue distribution and persistence in mice. In a xenograft mouse study using the pancreatic cancer cell line PSN-1, subcutaneous administration of 2 mg/kg per day NOX-A50 formulated in polyplexes showed an enhanced delivery of NOX-A50 to the tumor and a significant reduction of tumor volume. Our results demonstrate that intracellular targets can be successfully addressed with a Spiegelmer using polyethylenimine-based delivery and underline the importance of HMGA1 as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.

HMGA1b, and HMGA1c belong to one protein family encoded by the HMGA1 gene. They act as architectural transcription factors by binding via AT hook motifs to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA, leading to modulation of chromatin and nucleosome remodeling. Their ability to regulate the activity of several genes through the recognition and alteration of the DNA double helix and chromatin substrates has been linked to the development of human cancers (1Martinez Hoyos J.

Thus, HMGA1 is considered a promising target to treat cancer development, progression, and metastasis. high mobility group protein A1 isothermal titration calorimetry nitrogen/phosphate polyethyleneimine spiegelmer. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the intracellular HMGA1 protein family can be successfully targeted with a Spiegelmer, a large structured molecule that is comparable with a monoclonal antibody in terms of specific target binding. Spiegelmers (German: Spiegel = mirror) are structured biostable l-oligonucleotides that differ from their aptamer counterparts in their sugar moiety, which consists of mirror-image l-(deoxy)ribose rather than d-(deoxy)ribose and makes Spiegelmers highly resistant to nucleases (11Eulberg D.

Klussmann, F. Morich, W. G. Purschke, C. Schmidt, A. Vater, S. Vonhoff, D. Vossmeyer, and S. Zöllner, unpublished results. Here, we report the generation of a Spiegelmer, binding to HMGA1 with high affinity. Employing the SELEX process (16Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8173) Google Scholar), we first isolated RNA aptamers that bind to the mirror-image configuration of a 21-amino acid-long HMGA1a/b fragment. The chiral counterpart to the aptamer, the corresponding Spiegelmer (l-RNA), binds to recombinant full-length HMGA1b and also competes HMGA1b from its naturally occurring binding partner (AT-rich double-stranded DNA). To target intracellular HMGA1 we established a delivery system based on polyethylenimine (PEI). Branched PEI has been described to facilitate cellular uptake by condensing nucleic acids and the cationic carrier into complexes suitable for endocytosis (17Lungwitz U. Breunig M. Blunk T. Göpferich A. Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2005; 60: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 18Neu M. Fischer D. Kissel T. J.

PEGylation of the nucleic acids sterically prevents aggregation of polyplexes and balances binding to negatively charged proteoglycans on cell surfaces, thus enhancing transfection efficiency and reducing unspecific effects (20Sonawane N.D. Szoka Jr., F.C. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44826-44831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Using the PEI-based delivery system, we formulated HMGA1-binding Spiegelmers as polyplexes. The polyplexes were characterized in vitro and also used in a xenograft tumor growth model using the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PSN-1 (21Yamada H. Yoshida T. Sakamoto H. Terada M. Sugimura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Distribution of the formulated Spiegelmers to the tumor was strongly enhanced, and the tumor volume of the treated animals was significantly attenuated compared with control groups. The biotinylated all-d-21-mer HMGA1b fragment (Ac-HMGA1/b36–56(Lys-AEEAc-AEEAc-biotin)OH) was custom-synthesized (BACHEM, Bubendorf, Switzerland). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry: DNA library, 5′-GGAGCTCAGACTGGCACGCTG-N40-CAGCACAAGTTGTCGGTTCCAC-3′; forward primer, 5′-TCTAATACGACTCACTGAGCTCGACTGGCACGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTGGAACCGACAACTTGTGC-3′; NOX-A50, 5′-GGCUGAUACGUGGGUGGAUAUGGGGCAGUCAGUGGGUGUUUCAGCC-3′; NOX-f33, 5′-GGAUCGCAGGGGCGUGGCUGGGGUGGGCGAUCC-3′. As control substances the respective reverse sequences (5′- and -3′-end exchanged) called revNOX-A50 and revNOX-f33 as well as an l-RNA with an arbitrary sequence 5′-UAAGGAAACUCGGCUGAUGCGGUAGCGCUGUGCAGAGCU-3′ (control SPM) were used. NOX-A50 and the control Spiegelmers were modified with a 2-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety via a 3′-aminohexyl linker as described (15Wlotzka B. Leva S. Eschgfäller B. Burmeister J. Kleinjung F.

The biodistribution analysis was done employing a plate-based sandwich hybridization assay. Therefore, a capture-probe (5′-NH2-TTTTTTTTTAGCTCTGCACAGCGCT-3′) and a detect probe (5′-CCGCATCAGACCGAGTTTCCTTATTTTT-TTT-Biotin-3′) complementary to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the control SPM, respectively, were prepared. For NOX-A50 5′-CCCATATCCACCCACGTATCAGCCTTTTTTTT-NH2-3′) (capture probe) and 5′-Biotin-TTTTTTTTGGCTGAAACCACCCACATGG-3′ (detect probe) were used. HMGA1b from the BD-FreedomTM ORF clone GH00552L1.0 (BioCat, Heidelberg, Germany) was cloned into the pHO2d vector (a kind gift from Dr. Henning Otto, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany) to generate a C-terminally His6-tagged form under control of a T7-promoter (22Fasshauer D.

It was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified using HIS-Select-columns (Sigma-Aldrich). The HMGA1b-His6 fusion protein differs from the native HMGA1b in position 2 (Ser to Gly exchange), and Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Asn-Ser-His6 was added to the C terminus. Automated and manual in vitro selection experiments were performed against the biotinylated 21-amino acid mirror-image peptide, representing a central sequence of HMGA1a/b in selection buffer resembling intracellular ion conditions and pH (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 140 mm KCl, 12 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20) at 37 °C (13Helmling S.

The Biacore 2000 instrument (General Electric, Fairfield, CT) was set to 37 °C 500–1000 response units (RU) of recombinant HMGA1b-His6 were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by NHS/EDC coupling (Amine Coupling kit, General Electric). Kinetic parameters and dissociation constants were determined after a series of Spiegelmer injections at concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.63, 7.8, 3.9, 1.95, and 0 nm in selection buffer or in “extracellular buffer” (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20). The assays were double referenced. Using the BIA-evaluation 3.0 software applying Langmuir 1:1 stoichiometric fitting algorithm the association (ka) and dissociation rate constants (kd) were determined by local fitting and the dissociation constants (KD) were calculated accordingly. Recombinant HMGA1b (24 μm) was titrated to NOX-A50 or revNOX-A50 (2.4 μm) in a VP-ITC machine (General Electric) in selection buffer at 37 °C. The number of injections was set to 40 with a volume of 3 μl, a duration of 6 s, a spacing of 300 s, and a filter period of 16 s with a stirring speed of 300 rpm. Data analysis was performed with VP-ITC 2000 Evaluation software. Spiegelmer from 1 nm to 10 μm was incubated at 37 °C with 0.36 μg/ml recombinant HMGA1b in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 140 mm KCl, 12 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 18–20 μg/ml poly(dG·dC) (Sigma-Aldrich) (9Giancotti V.

Biotinylated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA, equimolar mixture of 5′-biotin-TCGAAAAAAGCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGCTTTTTT-3′ (25Fashena S.J. Reeves R. Ruddle N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 894-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 150 mm NaCl were added to a final concentration of 150 nm and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The mixture was transferred to a streptavidin-coated 96-well plate (Reacti-Bind; Pierce), incubated under shaking at 37 °C for 30 min, and finally washed three times with 200 μl of TBSTCM (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20). Bound recombinant HMGA1b was detected after adding 50 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of Ni2+-HRP (ExpressDetector Nickel-HRP; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) in TBSTCM with 10 mg/ml BSA at room temperature for 1 h, washing, and finally adding 100 μl of fluorogenic HRP substrate (QuantaBlue, Pierce) for 15 min. Fluorescence (λex/em = 340/405 nm) was measured on a FluoStar Optima plate reader (BMG, Offenburg, Germany); results were plotted as percent recombinant HMGA1b bound versus Spiegelmer concentration. PEGylated Spiegelmer at a final concentration of 20–100 μg/ml was rapidly mixed in HBG buffer (5% (w/w) glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1) with 25-kDa branched PEI (Sigma-Aldrich) at various nitrogen/phosphate (N/P) ratios (N/P = molar ratio of PEI nitrogen to RNA phosphate). Polyplex formation was measured by RiboGreen (R-11491; Molecular Probes) exclusion assay as described (26Petersen H. Kunath K. Martin A.L. Stolnik S. Roberts C.J. Davies M.C. Kissel T. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 926-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 0.5–1 × 104 PSN-1 cells (ECACC, Salisbury, UK) (21Yamada H. Yoshida T. Sakamoto H. Terada M. Sugimura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were seeded in 96-well plates (Sigma-Aldrich) 16–24 h prior to Spiegelmer polyplex treatment. The cells were cultivated for 0, 1, 2, or 4 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 10 μl of 0.44 mm Alamar-Blue (Resazurin) (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS was added and incubated at 37 °C for additional 2 h, and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader at λex/em = 544/590 nm. Studies were performed at EPO (Berlin, Germany). 107 PSN-1 cells were injected subcutaneously in the flank of nude mice (NMRInu/nu, age 6–8 weeks, n = 4/group). The 3′-PEGylated control SPM and polyplexes thereof were injected subcutaneously daily near the tumor site from days 5 to 25 at a dose of 10 mg/kg (Spiegelmer part only). Animals were killed 24 and 96 h after last treatment (n = 4/time point). EDTA plasma was prepared from terminal blood, and tumor and selected organs were dissected. The tissues were homogenized in hybridization buffer (0.05 m trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% (w/v) SDS) and centrifuged. The supernatant was used for determination of Spiegelmer levels. Therefore, DNA-BIND plates (Corning Co-star, Corning, NY) were preincubated with capture probe (0.75 nm) in coupling buffer (500 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C overnight, washed with coupling buffer, blocked with 0.5% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h, and finally washed with hybridization buffer. Plasma or homogenized tissue supernatant was incubated with 2 μm detection probe, denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, transferred to the prepared DNA-BIND plate, and incubated at 40 °C for 45 min. After washing the plate with hybridization buffer and Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), the bound Spiegelmer was detected by adding a 1:5000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), incubating at 20 °C for 1 h, and washing two times with TBST and assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.8, 1 mm MgCl2). Next, 100 μl of READY-to-use substrate (Applied Biosystems) was added and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min, and chemoluminescence was measured using a plate reader. Studies were performed at EPO. 107 PSN-1 cells were injected subcutaneously in the flank of nude mice (NMRInu/nu, age 6–8 weeks, n = 8/group). NOX-A50–3′-PEG or revNOX-A50–3′-PEG Spiegelmers (100 μl, 2 mg/kg) in PEI-polyplexes (N/P 2.5) or vehicle (PBS) were injected subcutaneously near the tumor cell inoculation site daily from days 6 to 22. Tumor volume and body weight were measured three times a week. Animals were killed 24 h after the last injection, and EDTA plasma was prepared from terminal blood. Furthermore, kidneys, liver, and tumor were harvested to determine Spiegelmer concentrations. Nonlinear regression analysis and statistical significance evaluation (Student's t test) were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). IC50 values and rate and equilibrium constants are reported as mean ± S.E. of multiple independent experiments. The tumor sizes in the xenograft treatment study are presented as box-and-whisker plots (27Tukey J.W. Science. 1977; 198: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). After 12 rounds of in vitro selection performed with the d-peptide fragment of HMGA1a/b (Glu36–Lys56 of HMGA1b) library affinities of 10–20 nm were measured (data not shown). Forty individual sequences were determined by cloning and sequencing. Sequence alignment revealed 22 sequences sharing the common motif 1 Nx-GGGGNGNGGNUGGGGNGG-Nx and 18 sequences motif 2 Nx-GGGNG-Nx-GGGNG-Nx (Fig. 1). Secondary structure predictions (28Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar) suggest a stabilizing stem structure formed by the 5′ and 3′ termini flanking these motifs. Based on this prediction we truncated the primer binding sites. The affinities of these truncated aptamers to the selection target range from 8–22 nm and are comparable with the full-length aptamers. Without substantial loss in affinity sequence 132-B3-001 could be further reduced to the smallest aptamer (132-B3-003), again confirming the predicted stem structure. Further truncations to stems shorter than seven nucleotides, however, resulted in considerably reduced affinity. The most frequent motif 2 aptamer (NOX-A1-001) and the shortest motif 1 aptamer (NOX-B3-003) were synthesized as Spiegelmers (NOX-A50 and NOX-f33, respectively). The affinities of NOX-A50 and NOX-f33 to recombinant HMGA1b are comparable with those of the corresponding aptamers to the biotinylated d-HMGA1b(Glu36–Lys56) fragment as determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements at 37 °C under intracellular buffer conditions: NOX-A50 binds to immobilized recombinant HMGA1b with an association rate of 2.7 ± 0.2 × 104 m−1s−1 and a dissociation rate of 1.9 ± 0.1 × 10−4 s−1 whereas NOX-f33 displays a faster association rate with 5.9 ± 0.9 × 104 m−1s−1 and a slower dissociation rate of 1.2 ± 0.2 × 10−4 s−1. The resulting dissociation constants are 7.1 ± 0.9 nm for NOX-A50 and 2.4 ± 0.4 nm for NOX-f33 (Fig. 2). Binding evaluation of the Spiegelmers under extracellular buffer conditions did not show any difference in binding kinetics or affinity. Both Spiegelmers showed a 1:1 Langmuir binding kinetic with little unspecific binding contribution. Control Spiegelmers revNOX-A50 and revNOX-f33 showed only weak unspecific binding with an approximate dissociation constants of 3–5 μm (data not shown). The specific binding of NOX-A50 to recombinant HMGA1b was also confirmed by ITC measurement at 37 °C. In this assay, which does not require immobilization of one binding partner, NOX-A50 binds HMGA1b with a KD of 18 ± 9 nm, whereas revNOX-A50 shows no binding (supplemental Fig. S1). Employing a competitive plate-based assay, NOX-A50 and NOX-f33 were characterized for their ability to inhibit binding of recombinant HMGA1b to AT-rich dsDNA, the natural binding partner of HMGA1b. Binding of 20 nm HMGA1b to biotinylated AT-rich dsDNA was inhibited dose-dependently by NOX-A50 and NOX-f33 with IC50 of 15.35 ± 1.20 nm and 22.21 ± 2.20 nm, respectively (Fig. 3). revNOX-A50 and rev-NOX-f33 showed no significant inhibition up to a concentration of 300 nm (supplemental Fig. S2). Because of its slightly better inhibition, NOX-A50 was selected for further studies. To target intracellularly localized HMGA1 proteins with Spiegelmers, a protocol for intracellular delivery based on the cationic polymer PEI was established. For proof of concept purposes a nonfunctional Spiegelmer with a covalently attached 2-kDa PEG moiety was used. This Spiegelmer was complexed with branched 25-kDa PEI at various N/P ratios The complexation rate was determined by a RiboGreen exclusion assay, which indicated that >95% of the Spiegelmer can be trapped in Spiegelmer polyplexes at an N/P ratio of >2 (supplemental Fig. S3). For subsequent studies, an N/P ratio of 2.5 was adjusted to achieve maximal complexation at minimal use of PEI. To compare tissue distribution and persistence of pure Spiegelmer and Spiegelmer polyplexes regardless of any target interaction, a multiple dose pilot study with control SPM was conducted in PSN-1 cell tumor-bearing mice. Animals showed no injection site reactions, no significant loss of body weight, or influence on tumor growth over the treatment period (data not shown). 24 h after the last injection Spiegelmer and Spiegelmer polyplexes show comparable plasma levels. However, regarding tumor distribution Spiegelmer polyplexes lead to approximately 30-fold higher levels of Spiegelmer than administration of Spiegelmer alone. At 96 h, a prolonged elimination time from plasma and tumor for Spiegelmer polyplexes compared with Spiegelmer alone was observed (Fig. 4). No significant amounts of Spiegelmer were detected in other tissues with the exception of slightly elevated levels in kidneys (Spiegelmer and Spiegelmer polyplexes) and liver (Spiegelmer alone) (supplemental Table S1). NOX-A50 and revNOX-A50 polyplexes were prepared to characterize their biological activity in vitro. The 3′-terminal 2-kDa PEG modification desired for the polyplex tolerability (29Ogris M. Walker G. Blessing T. Kircheis R. Wolschek M. Wagner E. J. Controlled Release. 2003; 91: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) does not influence the binding of NOX-A50 to recombinant HMGA1b as shown by the competitive assay for the inhibition of the HMGA1b-dsDNA interaction (supplemental Fig. S4). Although Western blots confirm high levels of HMGA1a/b in the nucleus or perinuclear region of PSN1 cells, NOX-A50 polyplexes showed no significant reduction of PSN-1 cell proliferation compared with revNOX-A50 polyplexes. The observed (dose-dependent) effects were considered formulation-dependent and thus unspecific (data not shown). The effects of NOX-A50 polyplexes on tumor growth were evaluated in a xenograft mouse model with PSN-1 cell-derived tumors. In all animals an aggressive, but homogeneous tumor growth was observed. After 22 days the mean tumor volume in the vehicle-treated group was 2.4 ± 0.2 cm3 (n = 8). Daily subcutaneous injections of 2 mg/kg NOX-A50 in polyplexes on days 5–22 showed a significant effect on the course of tumor growth, whereas nonfunctional revNOX-A50 polyplexes showed no significant influence (Fig. 5A). After 23 days the animals were killed for ethical reasons (some tumors in the control groups exceeded 3 cm3). Statistical end point analysis on day 22 revealed a significant (p = 0.0098) reduction of tumor growth by NOX-A50 polyplex treatment (tumor volume 1.4 ± 0.2 cm3) compared with treatment with vehicle (tumor volume 2.4 ± 0.2 cm3). This effect was sequence-specific for NOX-A50 because revNOX-A50 polyplexes showed no influence on tumor growth (tumor volume 3.0 ± 0.4 cm3, p = 0.0026 versus NOX-A50 polyplex group) (Fig. 5B). The analysis of NOX-A50 tissue distribution 24 h after the last injection showed results comparable with the delivery study with the control SPM polyplexes: high amounts of NOX-A50 were observed in the tumor, whereas only little amounts were detected in liver and kidney tissue (Fig. 5C and supplemental Table S1). Employing an in vitro selection approach using a central fragment of the architectural transcription factors HMGA1a/b as a selection target, we have identified Spiegelmers that bind to recombinant HMGA1b with high affinity in the low nanomolar range and effectively prevent the binding of HMGA1b to its nuclear binding partner, i.e. AT-rich dsDNA. For targeting intracellularly localized HMGA1, an efficient delivery system based on complexation of Spiegelmers with branched PEI was established. Compared with unformulated Spiegelmers, such Spiegelmer polyplexes show enhanced delivery to the tumor tissue in vivo. The persistence of Spiegelmer polyplexes in tumor and plasma compared with unformulated Spiegelmer was efficiently prolonged. Most importantly, NOX-A50 polyplexes were capable of significantly reducing tumor volume of PSN-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in a mouse xenograft study. This finding describes the first approach of targeting the intracellular protein HMGA1b with a large molecule using a formulation technique for an efficient intracellular delivery. HMGA1 proteins have already been suggested as therapeutic targets (5Reeves R. Beckerbauer L.M. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar), and several studies demonstrated the importance of HMGA1 in tumor progression and metastasis (3Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell.

HMGA1a/b overexpression is a common feature of human malignant neoplasias, plays a crucial role in cell transformation, and possesses oncogenic properties. Some controversy remains, however, because the appearance of a neoplastic phenotype in Hmga1−/− and Hmga1+/− mice revealed that HMGA proteins can also have a tumor suppressor function (30Fedele M.

IntroductionMammalian cholesterol synthesis is a tightly controlled process regulated by negative feedback inhibition (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). The central components of this process are two endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumSREBPsterol regulatory element binding proteinScapSREBP cleavage activating proteinSSDsterol-sensing domain.-resident integral membrane proteins, SREBP and its binding partner Scap. SREBP is a membrane-bound transcription factor that, when proteolytically activated, enters the nucleus and induces transcription of genes required to increase intracellular cholesterol levels (2Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Regulated SREBP activation requires both Scap and a third ER membrane protein, Insig.Scap senses ER cholesterol concentration by directly binding cholesterol in the membrane (3Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and cholesterol binding induces a conformational change in Scap that promotes binding to Insig, retaining the SREBP-Scap complex in the ER (4Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 5Sun L.P. Seemann J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When cholesterol is depleted, SREBP-Scap dissociates from Insig and can then be transported to the Golgi apparatus (4Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 6DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The N-terminal transcription factor domain of SREBP is liberated from the membrane by two Golgi-resident proteases, allowing SREBP to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of its target genes (2Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Activation of SREBP target genes ultimately restores ER cholesterol, which in turn promotes Scap-Insig binding, thus blocking further ER-to-Golgi transport of SREBP-Scap and completing a negative feedback loop.Studies of SREBP in the genetically tractable fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that this mammalian sterol-sensing mechanism is conserved and that SREBP functions as a principal hypoxic transcription factor in fungi (7Bien C.M. Espenshade P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2010; 9: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the pathogenic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus, SREBP is required for virulence in fungal disease models (8Chang Y.C. Bien C.M. Lee H. Espenshade P.J. Kwon-Chung K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Chun C.D. Liu O.W. Madhani H.D.

PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000200Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Fission yeast has homologs of SREBP and Scap called Sre1 and Scp1, respectively (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Sre1-Scp1 complex monitors synthesis of ergosterol, the fungal equivalent of cholesterol, as an indirect measure of oxygen supply. When cellular oxygen levels are low, oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis is inhibited, and Sre1-Scp1 responds by increasing transcription of genes required for adaptation to hypoxia, including enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis.Given the broad conservation, importance for fungal disease, and detailed knowledge of SREBP pathway components and function, we seek to create a mathematical model of this sterol regulatory system. As a first step, we have focused on the fission yeast Sre1 pathway. A comprehensive mathematical model would enable a thorough systems-level analysis of this pathway, including quantifying the contributions of its different parts to overall performance and evaluating the system's robustness to mutations (12Kitano H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 13Tomlin C.J. Axelrod J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4219-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because of the conserved structure and function between the components of the mammalian and yeast SREBP pathways, such a model will likely also shed light on the process of cholesterol regulation in mammals.The Sre1 pathway can be divided conceptually into three regulatory steps as follows: Sre1 transport and cleavage, Sre1 activity in the nucleus, and ergosterol biosynthesis. As an initial step in modeling this pathway, we chose to investigate quantitatively the mechanism by which sterols control the rate of ER-Golgi transport and cleavage of Sre1-Scp1. Although mammalian cells respond to the biosynthetic end product cholesterol, our previous studies concluded that the Sre1-Scp1 complex senses 4-methyl sterols, a class of intermediates in ergosterol synthesis, as the cleavage-activating signal (14Hughes A.L. Lee C.Y. Bien C.M. Espenshade P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24388-24396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this worked was not well understood insomuch as Sre1 cleavage occurred when 4-methyl sterols both increased and decreased. Recent studies have also called into question the purity of the commercial lanosterol preparations used in these experiments (15Lange Y. Ory D.S. Ye J. Lanier M.H. Hsu F.F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated the sterol-dependent transport and cleavage of Sre1-Scp1 using a combination of experimental and mathematical techniques. We specifically sought to understand what sterol the Sre1-Scp1 complex senses, how this sensing could be described quantitatively, and what molecular mechanism could perform it. To facilitate this, we created a genetically modified strain of S. pombe that isolated the transport-cleavage process from several other factors known to affect it. Based on prior knowledge of the system, we constructed a mathematical model of this modified strain consisting of nonlinear differential equations describing the known interactions between the components in the pathway. We then performed experiments on the modified strain of yeast, interpreted the results with the aid of our model, and used the results to expand the model to include a quantitative empirical description of how the process of Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage responds to changes in cellular sterols. Our results suggest that ergosterol is the signal that regulates Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage and that the mechanism for this activation is similar to that used by mammalian Scap.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast cell culture and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Compactin, terbinafine, lanosterol (L5768), and itraconazole were obtained from Sigma; 25-thialanosterol was a gift of W. David Nes (Texas Tech University). Lanosterol (lanosterol/24,25-dihydrolanosterol mixture) and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol were from Steraloids (C3250 and C8600, respectively).Strains and MediaHaploid S. pombe strains were grown to log phase at 30 °C in YES medium (0.5% (w/v) yeast extract plus 3% (w/v) glucose and supplements, 225 mg/liter each of uracil, adenine, leucine, histidine, and lysine).

Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).Sre1 Cleavage AssaySre1 cleavage was induced by addition of drugs or depletion of oxygen (as indicated in figure legends) at time = 0. Separate cultures were started for each time point such that cells reached a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml at the time of harvest. Samples for gas chromatography (5 × 107 cells) and immunoblotting (2 × 107 cells) were removed at different times and frozen for later analysis. Prior to SDS-PAGE, protein samples were treated with alkaline phosphatase to collapse the heavily phosphorylated Sre1N into a single band for quantitation (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Western blots were quantified using the Versadoc Imaging System with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The percent cleavage of Sre1 (100 × Sre1N/[Sre1N + Sre1 precursor]) was determined using signals from each individual lane.Determination of Yeast SterolsGas chromatography of total sterols was performed as described previously (14Hughes A.L. Lee C.Y. Bien C.M. Espenshade P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24388-24396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For discrimination of free and total sterols, 1 × 108 yeast cells were grown as indicated, lysed at 4 °C by vortexing for 5 min with glass beads in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and adjusted to a volume of 0.5 ml. Cholesterol recovery standard (10 μg) was added to the lysate, which was then divided in half and either saponified in 13.5 ml of 2:1 methanol, 60% KOH at 75 °C for 2 h or mixed with 13.5 ml of 2:1 methanol, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, at room temperature. Both saponified and unsaponified fractions were extracted with 4 ml of petroleum ether and analyzed by gas chromatography as described previously (14Hughes A.L. Lee C.Y. Bien C.M. Espenshade P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24388-24396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Percent esterification was calculated for each sterol species by dividing the difference between quantities of total and free sterol by the quantity of total sterol.Modeling Sre1 DynamicsTo understand the relationship between the rate of Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage and the fraction of Sre1 cleavage observed over time, we developed a mathematical model of Sre1 dynamics in sre1-MP ubr1Δ hrd1Δ yeast (Fig. 3A). This model describes a population of cells growing exponentially and asynchronously, thus avoiding the need to model cell cycle-dependent effects and enabling the model to be used with data gathered from growing populations of yeast.Table 1 lists the processes included in this model, described under “Results,” along with their rate coefficients. The symbols W, X, Y, and XN represent Scp1, Sre1, Sre1-Scp1 complex, and Sre1N, respectively. Because the Sre1 positive feedback loop is broken in this strain (see under “Results”), we can assume that Sre1 and Scp1 are produced by transcription and translation at constant concentration rates kpX and kpW, respectively. We assume a one-to-one stoichiometry between Sre1 and Scp1; these proteins bind with a rate constant k1 and unbind with a rate constant k2. Furthermore, we treat transport and cleavage of Sre1-Scp1 complex as a single step and assume that the rate coefficient for this step, fTC, is not constant but changes in time. This accounts for the capability of the Sre1-Scp1 complex to increase its rate of transport and cleavage upon detecting some signal, likely a change in the rate of sterol synthesis. We also assume that, as part of the transport and cleavage step, Scp1 is liberated from the Sre1-Scp1 complex and recycled to the ER to form new Sre1-Scp1 complexes (18Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Each chemical species is diluted due to the exponential growth of the population of cells; this happens at a rate proportional to the concentration of the species with a rate coefficient β. A mathematical justification for this step and a procedure for calculating β are presented in the supplemental material. Denoting concentrations of chemical species in italics, we can write rate equations to describe the dynamics of this system as shown in (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4).dXdt=kpX−k1XW+k2Y−βX(Eq. 1) dYdt=k1XW−k2Y−fTCY−βY(Eq. 2) dXndt=fTCY−βXN(Eq. 3) dWdt=kpW−k1XW+k2Y+fTCY−βW(Eq. 4) TABLE 1Processes identified in Sre1 transport-cleavage mechanism in sre1-MP ubr1Δ hrd1Δ cellsProcessRate coefficientValue in normalized modelSre1 transcription/translation→ XkpXkpX/XT = 0.23 h−1Scp1 transcription/translation→ WkpWkpW/XT = 0.046 h−1Sre1-Scp1 bindingX + W → Yk1k1XT = 850 h−1Sre1-Scp1 unbindingY → X + Wk2k2 = 0.2 h−1Sre1-Scp1 transport/cleavageY → XN + WfTCVariesDilutionW, X, Y, XN →ββ = 0.23 h−1 Open table in a new tab The total concentration of Sre1 in the system is XT = X + Y + XN. Adding (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) gives us Equation 5,dXTdt=kpX−βXT(Eq. 5) One can see from Equation 5 that if the rates of Sre1 production (kpX) and dilution due to cell growth (β) remain constant, XT will approach the steady-state value kpX/β. It follows that if each experiment begins at steady state and the experimental treatments do not significantly change the rates of Sre1 production or cell growth, then XT is constant over the course of each experiment. Thus, we can normalize the model by dividing (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4) by XT, making the substitutions w = W/XT, x = X/XT, y = Y/XT, and xN = XN/XT as shown in (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), (Eq. 8), (Eq. 9),dxdt=kpXXT−k1XTxw+k2y−βx(Eq. 6) dydt=k1XTxw−k2y−fTCy−βy(Eq. 7) dxNdt=fTCy − βXN(Eq. 8) dwdt=kpwXT−k1XTxw+k2y+fTCy−βw(Eq. 9) Similarly, if we denote the total concentration of Scp1 in the normalized model as wT = w + y, then adding Equations 7 and 9 gives us Equation 10,dwTdt=kpWXT−βWT(Eq. 10) If the rate of Scp1 production (kpW) remains constant, then wT will approach the steady-state value kpX/(βXT). Assuming that each experiment begins at steady state and that the experimental treatments do not significantly affect Scp1 production, then wT is also constant over the course of each experiment. This simplifies the solution of (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), (Eq. 8), (Eq. 9).Having normalized the model, we now estimate its rate constants. Untreated sre1-MP ubr1Δ hrd1Δ cells have a doubling time of ∼3 h, which gives us β = ln(2)/3 = 0.23 h−1 (supplemental material). Because XT is constant, we can set the left side of Equation 5 to zero, yielding kpX/XT = β = 0.23 h−1. In untreated sre1-MP ubr1Δ hrd1Δ cells, the concentration of Scp1 is approximately equal to that of Sre1 precursor (supplemental material), and on average, Sre1 precursor levels in untreated cells were about 20% of total Sre1 levels (see under “Results”). Thus, wT = (W + Y)/XT = 0.2, and because wT is constant, we set the left side of Equation 10 to zero to yield kpW/XT = βwT = 0.046 h−1. We also compute k1XT = 850 h−1 and estimate k2 = 0.2 h−1 (supplemental material).Calculating Transport-Cleavage Rate CoefficientGiven a time-varying rate coefficient for Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage, fTC(t), we can solve (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), (Eq. 8), (Eq. 9) to compute the resulting time-varying fraction of cleaved Sre1, xN(t). However, in our case, we have the following inverse problem: given xN(t) for the duration of an experiment, we want to compute the time-varying transport-cleavage rate coefficient fTC(t) that led to that fraction of cleaved Sre1. To do this, we rewrite Equation 7, making the substitutions x = 1 − xN − y and w = wT − y as well as a substitution for fTCy from Equation 8 to give Equation 11,dydt=k1XT(1−XN−y)(WT−y)−k2y−(dXNdt+βXN)−βy(Eq. 11) For each experiment, at each sampling time ti, we measured Sre1 precursor (X(ti) + Y(ti)) and Sre1N (XN(ti)) by quantifying Western blots as described above and calculated xN(ti) = XN(ti)/(X(ti) + Y(ti) + XN(ti)). We then estimated xN(t) for the duration of the experiment by interpolating the xN(ti) points with a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) (19Moler C.B. Numerical Computing with Matlab. Society for Industrial and Mathematics, Philadelphia2004: 99-102Google Scholar). For numerical stability in solving the model equations, we capped the value of xN(t) at 0.995. To find an initial condition y(0) for the experiment, we used the starting point xN(0), assumed to be the steady-state value of xN before treatment, to solve (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), (Eq. 8), (Eq. 9) at steady state (supplemental material). With the continuous input xN(t) and initial condition y(0), we solved Equation 11 with Matlab's ode15s routine to compute y(t) for the duration of the experiment. Finally, we solved for fTC(t) by Equation 8.Estimating Ergosterol in the ERAs described under “Results,” experimental evidence points to ergosterol as the signal that regulates the transport and cleavage of the Sre1-Scp1 complex. However, most of the ergosterol in a yeast cell is not located in the ER (20Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and thus is not detectable by Sre1 and Scp1, which are embedded in the ER membrane. We used a mathematical model (supplemental material) to estimate [SER], the concentration of detectable ergosterol in the ER, from [ST], the measured total amount of ergosterol per cell. [ST] includes both nonesterified and esterified ergosterol.Curve Fitting and Error MeasurementsOur method for fitting a curve to calculated points of fTC and [SER] (Fig. 6A) is informed by the structure of the model of Sre1 dynamics. Solving (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), (Eq. 8), (Eq. 9), (Eq. 10) for the value of fTC required to obtain a given value of xN at steady state (supplemental material) reveals that fTC scales exponentially with xN for xN < 0.8 and superexponentially for higher values of xN (supplemental Fig. 2). Because this relationship describes the way that error in measuring Sre1 levels leads to error in the calculated value of fTC, it is most appropriate to consider the logarithm of fTC when fitting a curve to it. Thus, when computing the best fit curve to relate calculated values of fTC and [SER] (Fig. 6A), we minimized the sum of squared differences between the logarithm of the calculated fTC values and the logarithm of the fTC values predicted by the curve and computed R2 accordingly. Calculation of the best fit curve and 95% confidence intervals for the parameters of the curve was performed by nonlinear regression in Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL).FIGURE 6fTC, the rate coefficient for Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage, is a function of ergosterol in the ER (A) and not of other sterol pathway intermediates (B–D). Points on each graph represent data from time course experiments with different disturbances to the sterol production pathway conducted as in Fig. 4, identified in the legend. ρ is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for the pair of variables in each graph. The curve in A is a function fTC([SER]) = kTC/(1 + k·[SER]n) with parameters kTC = 57 h−1, k = 1100, and n = 1.8 chosen to minimize the mean squared error between the logarithm of the curve and the logarithm of the data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the percentages of Sre1 cleavage predicted by model simulations with those calculated from experimental measurements (Fig. 7), we defined an error metric that takes into account how normalizing distorts errors in the original data. For example, if the actual percentage of Sre1 cleavage (xN) is 95%, a 10% overestimate of XN leads to a 0.45% mismatch in xN, but if the actual xN is 75%, the same 10% overestimate of XN leads to a 2.3% mismatch in xN. Because of this, our error metric, described in detail in the supplemental material, considers how much error in the measurements (X + Y) and XN would be required to produce a given error in xN.FIGURE 7Model simulations (line) compared with measurements of Sre1N (points) in time course experiments used to generate (A–F) and validate (G–L) the model. Dark, medium, and light shaded regions represent ±10, ±30, and ±50% error, respectively, around measurements of Sre1N using the error metric described under “Experimental Procedures.” eRMS is the root-mean-squared error between the simulated trajectory of Sre1N and the curve generated by interpolating the Sre1N data points, calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that ergosterol regulates the rate of transport and cleavage of the Sre1-Scp1 complex in fission yeast. Previous experiments in which addition of exogenous lanosterol activated Sre1 cleavage were found to be misleading, as the lanosterol mixture used contains a contaminant that inhibits ergosterol production and causes the concentration of cellular ergosterol to decrease (Fig. 2). This motivated further investigation, which concluded that ergosterol is the signal regulating Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage. Multiple lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, different chemical inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis, which inhibit enzymatic steps both early and late in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, induce Sre1 cleavage (Fig. 4, A–E). This cleavage is consistent with a drop in ergosterol concentration but inconsistent with changes in the concentration of any other sterol pathway intermediates measured. Second, elevated levels of free ergosterol achieved by blocking ergosterol esterification suppress Sre1 cleavage (Fig. 5). Third, the transport-cleavage rate coefficient (fTC) is a function of ergosterol but not other sterol pathway intermediates (Fig. 6). Importantly, although the mathematical model used to compute fTC from experimental data made no assumptions as to the nature of the signal regulating fTC, the model using ER ergosterol as the signal captures the behavior of the system (Fig. 7). Because ergosterol is the end product of the sterol biosynthetic pathway in yeast and the primary sterol component of the yeast plasma membrane and subcellular membranes (20Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it is fitting that the Sre1-Scp1 complex monitors ergosterol to assess the state of sterol production.The sensing of ergosterol by Sre1-Scp1 is yet another point of homology between the sterol regulatory system in S. pombe and that in mammals, inasmuch as SREBP and Scap monitor levels of cholesterol, the end product of mammalian sterol synthesis (18Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Scap contains an SSD in which three amino acids (Tyr-298, Leu-315, and Asp-443) are necessary for the SREBP-Scap complex to bind Insig and be retained in the ER; mutations of these amino acids render the complex constitutively active (29Yabe D. Xia Z.P. Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although Scp1 and Scap have low sequence identity overall, these three residues are conserved in Scp1 (Tyr-247, Leu-264, and Asp-392) along with sections of the protein surrounding these residues (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations of these three residues in Scp1 lead to increased Sre1-Scp1 cleavage without changes in the sterol profile (14Hughes A.L. Lee C.Y. Bien C.M. Espenshade P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24388-24396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that the SSD in yeast Scp1 functions similarly to that of mammalian Scap.The similarity between Scp1 sensing ergosterol in fission yeast and Scap sensing cholesterol in mammals suggests a possible molecular mechanism for how ergosterol regulates ER-Golgi transport of Sre1-Scp1 and subsequent cleavage of Sre1. Mammalian Scap measures cholesterol levels by binding directly to cholesterol (3Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and cholesterol changes the conformation of Scap (30Adams C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cholesterol promotes Scap binding to Insig, which retains the SREBP-Scap complex in the ER, thereby preventing SREBP cleavage in the Golgi (4Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 5Sun L.P. Seemann J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, cholesterol has been shown to block SREBP-Scap cleavage even in the absence of Insig (5Sun L.P. Seemann J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that cholesterol regulates SREBP-Scap transport in a cooperative manner (28Radhakrishnan A. Goldstein J.L. McDonald J.G. Brown M.S. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 512-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These data suggest a model in which Scap exists in two conformations as follows: one “active” conformation that is available for transport and proteolytic cleavage, and one “inactive” conformation that is retained in the ER and available to bind Insig (18Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In this model, cholesterol cooperatively promotes the transition from the active to the inactive state.Based on our results here, we propose a similar model for regulation of Sre1-Scp1 cleavage by ergosterol, noting that Ins1, the fission yeast homolog of Insig, does not play a role in this regulation (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 25Burg J.S. Powell D.W. Chai R. Hughes A.L. Link A.J. Espenshade P.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 522-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Suppose that Scp1, like Scap, has two conformations, an active state Y and an inactive state Z in rapid equilibrium, and the transition between these conformations is cooperatively dependent on the concentration of ergosterol in the ER ([SER]) with a Hill coefficient n (Fig. 8). Then for some constants α and K, we have Equation 12,Z=α[SER]nKn+[SER]nY(Eq. 12) FIGURE 8Sre1 pathway in wild-type yeast with a possible mechanism for regulation of Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage by ergosterol. Scp1 bound to Sre1 has two conformations, an active state Y and an inactive state Z. The equilibrium between these conformations is rapid and cooperatively dependent on levels of ergosterol in the ER. The active state Y is transported from the ER to the Golgi and cleaved to form Sre1N with a constant rate coefficient kTC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In our model of Sre1-Scp1 transport described above, fTC([SER]) is the rate coefficient for Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage, i.e. the rate of transport and cleavage per unit of concentration of complex. Suppose that the transport-cleavage rate coefficient is actually a constant kTC, but only the active state Y is available for this. Then the rate of transport and cleavage is kTCY and the concentration of Sre1-Scp1 complex is Y + Z. By the above definition of fTC([SER]), we now have Equation 13,fTC([SER])=kTCYY+Z=kTCYY+α[SER]nKn+[SER]nY =kTC1+α[SER]nKn+[SER]n≈kTC1+k[SER]n(Eq. 13) if K ≫ [SER].As shown under “Results” (Fig. 6A), this function describes our findings, demonstrating that a mechanism whereby ergosterol in the ER cooperatively mediates a transition between active and inactive forms of Sre1-Scp1 complex is a plausible explanation for our observations. Further studies will be required to confirm the existence of multiple conformations of Scp1 and the role of ergosterol in determining those conformations.Overall, the model developed here describes Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage with a reasonable degree of quantitative accuracy given the limitations of our measurements. Western blots of Sre1 are subject to significant experimental variability, and the nature of our procedure for calculating fTC tends to amplify this noise. Also, this model does not include the process of ergosterol esterification, which affects the amount of ergosterol available to be detected by the Sre1-Scp1 complex. Even with these limitations, the model describes most of the variability in the data (R2 = 0.77), suggesting that it captures the essence of the Sre1-Scp1 transport-cleavage dynamics. Furthermore, the process of curve fitting estimated the Hill coefficient for ergosterol sensing by Sre1-Scp1 within a fairly narrow range (1.8 ± 0.46). Although this model was developed in a genetically modified strain of S. pombe, it should be applicable to wild-type yeast, as we have no reason to believe that any mutation in this strain directly affects the machinery that performs Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage.In this study, we present evidence that ergosterol regulates the ER-Golgi transport and cleavage of Sre1-Scp1, the fission yeast homologs of mammalian SREBP-Scap. Additionally, we present a quantitative empirical model that describes the nature of this regulation and suggests a possible molecular mechanism by which it could work. The experiments used to generate and test this model were conducted in a modified yeast strain that lacks some of the complexity found in the Sre1-Scp1 system of wild-type yeast. However, we expect this model to serve as a discrete module that will be integrated in the future with models of the other subsystems (Fig. 1), ultimately allowing construction of a complete model for the fission yeast SREBP pathway. IntroductionMammalian cholesterol synthesis is a tightly controlled process regulated by negative feedback inhibition (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). The central components of this process are two endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumSREBPsterol regulatory element binding proteinScapSREBP cleavage activating proteinSSDsterol-sensing domain.-resident integral membrane proteins, SREBP and its binding partner Scap. SREBP is a membrane-bound transcription factor that, when proteolytically activated, enters the nucleus and induces transcription of genes required to increase intracellular cholesterol levels (2Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Regulated SREBP activation requires both Scap and a third ER membrane protein, Insig.Scap senses ER cholesterol concentration by directly binding cholesterol in the membrane (3Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and cholesterol binding induces a conformational change in Scap that promotes binding to Insig, retaining the SREBP-Scap complex in the ER (4Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 5Sun L.P. Seemann J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When cholesterol is depleted, SREBP-Scap dissociates from Insig and can then be transported to the Golgi apparatus (4Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 6DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The N-terminal transcription factor domain of SREBP is liberated from the membrane by two Golgi-resident proteases, allowing SREBP to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of its target genes (2Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Activation of SREBP target genes ultimately restores ER cholesterol, which in turn promotes Scap-Insig binding, thus blocking further ER-to-Golgi transport of SREBP-Scap and completing a negative feedback loop.Studies of SREBP in the genetically tractable fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that this mammalian sterol-sensing mechanism is conserved and that SREBP functions as a principal hypoxic transcription factor in fungi (7Bien C.M. Espenshade P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2010; 9: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the pathogenic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus, SREBP is required for virulence in fungal disease models (8Chang Y.C. Bien C.M. Lee H. Espenshade P.J. Kwon-Chung K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Chun C.D. Liu O.W. Madhani H.D.

PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000200Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Fission yeast has homologs of SREBP and Scap called Sre1 and Scp1, respectively (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Sre1-Scp1 complex monitors synthesis of ergosterol, the fungal equivalent of cholesterol, as an indirect measure of oxygen supply. When cellular oxygen levels are low, oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis is inhibited, and Sre1-Scp1 responds by increasing transcription of genes required for adaptation to hypoxia, including enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis.Given the broad conservation, importance for fungal disease, and detailed knowledge of SREBP pathway components and function, we seek to create a mathematical model of this sterol regulatory system. As a first step, we have focused on the fission yeast Sre1 pathway. A comprehensive mathematical model would enable a thorough systems-level analysis of this pathway, including quantifying the contributions of its different parts to overall performance and evaluating the system's robustness to mutations (12Kitano H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 13Tomlin C.J. Axelrod J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4219-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because of the conserved structure and function between the components of the mammalian and yeast SREBP pathways, such a model will likely also shed light on the process of cholesterol regulation in mammals.The Sre1 pathway can be divided conceptually into three regulatory steps as follows: Sre1 transport and cleavage, Sre1 activity in the nucleus, and ergosterol biosynthesis. As an initial step in modeling this pathway, we chose to investigate quantitatively the mechanism by which sterols control the rate of ER-Golgi transport and cleavage of Sre1-Scp1. Although mammalian cells respond to the biosynthetic end product cholesterol, our previous studies concluded that the Sre1-Scp1 complex senses 4-methyl sterols, a class of intermediates in ergosterol synthesis, as the cleavage-activating signal (14Hughes A.L. Lee C.Y. Bien C.M. Espenshade P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24388-24396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this worked was not well understood insomuch as Sre1 cleavage occurred when 4-methyl sterols both increased and decreased. Recent studies have also called into question the purity of the commercial lanosterol preparations used in these experiments (15Lange Y. Ory D.S. Ye J. Lanier M.H. Hsu F.F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated the sterol-dependent transport and cleavage of Sre1-Scp1 using a combination of experimental and mathematical techniques. We specifically sought to understand what sterol the Sre1-Scp1 complex senses, how this sensing could be described quantitatively, and what molecular mechanism could perform it. To facilitate this, we created a genetically modified strain of S. pombe that isolated the transport-cleavage process from several other factors known to affect it. Based on prior knowledge of the system, we constructed a mathematical model of this modified strain consisting of nonlinear differential equations describing the known interactions between the components in the pathway. We then performed experiments on the modified strain of yeast, interpreted the results with the aid of our model, and used the results to expand the model to include a quantitative empirical description of how the process of Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage responds to changes in cellular sterols. Our results suggest that ergosterol is the signal that regulates Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage and that the mechanism for this activation is similar to that used by mammalian Scap."

Following their translocation across the inner membrane (IM), ATs temporarily reside in the periplasmic space after which they are secreted into the extracellular environment. Previous studies have shown that the AT hemoglobin protease (Hbp) of Escherichia coli requires a functional signal recognition particle pathway and Sec translocon for optimal targeting to and translocation across the IM. Here, we analyzed the mode of IM translocation of Hbp in more detail. Using site-directed photocross-linking, we found that the Hbp signal peptide is adjacent to YidC early during biogenesis. Notably, YidC is in part associated with the Sec translocon but has until now primarily been implicated in the biogenesis of IM proteins. In vivo, YidC appeared critical for the biogenesis of the ATs Hbp and EspC. For Hbp, depletion of YidC resulted in the formation of secretion-incompetent intermediates that were sensitive to degradation by the periplasmic protease DegP, indicating that YidC activity affects Hbp biogenesis at a late stage, after translocation across the IM. This is the first demonstration of a role for YidC in the biogenesis of an extracellular protein. We propose that YidC is required for maintenance of the translocation-competent state of certain ATs in the periplasm. The large periplasmic domain of YidC is not critical for this novel functionality as it can be deleted without affecting Hbp biogenesis.

Several pathways have evolved that enable protein transfer across the cell envelope. The simplest and most widely distributed of these is the autotransporter (AT) or type Va secretion pathway that is dedicated to the secretion of large virulence factors (1Henderson I.R.

A number of studies suggest that the extended AT signal peptides are important at stages beyond the initial targeting step, slowing down either the progression of the ATs through the Sec translocon or the release from the IM after translocation (4Chevalier N.

Interestingly, the signal peptide of the SPATE EspP appeared to prevent misfolding of the AT in the periplasmic space into a conformation that is incompatible with OM translocation, possibly by transiently anchoring the AT passenger to the IM (9Szabady R.L. Peterson J.H. Skillman K.M. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The observation that Hbp can make use of the SRP targeting pathway was remarkable considering that SRP directs targeting of primarily integral inner membrane proteins (IMPs) with rather hydrophobic signal sequences (10Luirink J. Sinning I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 17-35PubMed Google Scholar). YidC has been identified as another component that plays a role in the biogenesis of IMPs. Available evidence suggests that it is in part associated with the SecYEG machinery (11Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. Mol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). YidC also functions independently from the translocon, catalyzing the insertion of relatively small/simple IMPs including subunits of the cytochrome o oxidase and F1F0-ATPase (22Xie K. Dalbey R.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As such, the Sec-independent function of YidC is essential for cell viability (23van Bloois E. Nagamori S. Koningstein G. Ullers R.S. Preuss M. Oudega B. Harms N. Kaback H.R. Herrmann J.M. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12996-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). YidC is an IMP with six TMs and a large periplasmic domain P1 (24Sääf A. Monné M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. J. Biol.

Stjepanovic G. Wild K. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9350-9358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, structure-function studies showed that the N-terminal 90% of this domain can be deleted without affecting cell viability and insertion of tested Sec-dependent and -independent substrates (14Xie K. Kiefer D. Nagler G. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13401-13408Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Jiang F. Chen M. Yi L. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48965-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), leaving the role of domain P1 unclear. To gain more insight into the mode of AT translocation across the IM, we studied the molecular interactions of Hbp during the early stages of membrane insertion using an in vitro translation and photocross-linking approach. Remarkably, we found that the Hbp signal peptide is in contact with YidC. When YidC was depleted in vivo, Hbp secretion was impaired as a result of the formation of secretion-incompetent Hbp intermediates in the periplasmic space. This is the first demonstration of a role for YidC in the biogenesis of an extracellular protein. The YidC conditional strain JS7131 has been described previously (28Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To construct the strain JS7131ΔdegP, the degP41(ΔPstI)::kanR allele was moved from strain KS476 (29Strauch K.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) into JS7131 by P1 transduction. Transductants were selected at 37 °C on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), 0.2% l-arabinose, and 10 mm sodium citrate. The absence of DegP was further confirmed by immunoblotting using DegP antiserum. Strains were routinely grown in LB medium at 30 °C. For YidC depletion experiments, cells were grown overnight in the presence of 0.2% glucose and 0.2% l-arabinose, washed in the same medium lacking l-arabinose, and subcultured to an OD660 of 0.05 in medium containing 0.2% glucose. l-arabinose (0.2%), or l-rhamnose (0.2%) was added, where appropriate, to induce the expression of YidC and YidC derivatives. If required, the medium was supplemented with streptomycin (50 μg/ml), chloramphinicol (20 μg/ml), kanamycin (30 μg/ml), spectinomycin (25 μg/ml), or ampicilin (100 μg/ml). Restriction enzymes, T4-DNA ligase, and Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate were purchased from Roche Applied Science. PfuUltra DNA Polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. l-Arabinose and l-rhamnose were supplied by Merck. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G was from Janssen Chimica. All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. The antisera against YidC and trigger factor (TF) were from our own collection. The antisera against PspA, DegP, and OmpA were kind gifts from J. Tommassen (Utrecht University), J. Beckwith (Harvard Medical School), and J. W. de Gier (Stockholm University), respectively. The plasmid pEH3-Hbp (30Jong W.S. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. den Blaauwen T. Slotboom D.J. Tame J.R. Wickström D. de Gier J.W. Otto B.R. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1524-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was used for the expression of Hbp. To allow expression of EspC in an identical genetic context, the gene encoding EspC was amplified by PCR using plasmid pJLM174 (31Dutta P.R. Cappello R. Navarro-García F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7105-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) as a template and the primers pEH-XbaI-EspC-fw and EspC-BamHI-rv. The resulting fragment was cloned into XbaI/BamHI digested pEH3-Hbp, yielding pEH3-EspC. The plasmid pEH3-PhoE was created in a similar way. The gene encoding phoE was amplified using Escherichia coli MC4100 genomic DNA as template and the primers pEH-XbaI-PhoE-fw and PhoE-BamHI-rv. The PCR fragment was cloned into XbaI/BamHI digested pEH3-Hbp, resulting in pEH3-PhoE. Plasmids pWSK-empty and pWSK-DegP were created as follows. First, pWSK29 (32Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene. 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) was digested with restriction enzymes BsaAI and PvuII, and the resulting 750-bp fragment, including lacZα, multiple cloning site, and T7 and T3 RNA polymerase promoters, was removed. The remaining 4684-bp vector fragment was blunt-end self-ligated, yielding pWSK-empty. To obtain pWSK-DegP, the degP gene and its regulatory elements were amplified from E. coli MC4100 genomic DNA by PCR using primers that annealed ∼480 bp upstream and ∼135 bp downstream of the degP gene, respectively. The primers used were Genom/degP[-480bp]-fw and Genom/degP[TAA+135bp]-rv. The resulting fragment carried two flanking SmaI sites that were used to clone the fragment into BsaAI/PvuII digested pWSK29 (see above) through blunt-end ligation. To allow l-rhamnose induced expression of YidC and YidCΔP1, a pWSK29 derivative was created that carried the multiple cloning site, rhaT promoter and rhaR/rhaS regulatory genes of pRHA-113 (33Giacalone M.J. Gentile A.M. Lovitt B.T. Berkley N.L. Gunderson C.W. Surber M.W. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To this end, a PCR fragment was generated using pRHA-113 as a template and the primers DrdI-Rha-fw and SapI-Rha-rv. The resulting fragment was cloned into the DrdI/SapI sites of pWSK29, yielding pWSK/Rha. To generate pWSK/Rha-YidC, the XbaI/SmaI fragment of pCL-ecOxa1, carrying the YidC coding sequence (23van Bloois E. Nagamori S. Koningstein G. Ullers R.S. Preuss M. Oudega B. Harms N. Kaback H.R.

To construct pWSK/Rha-YidCΔP1, the nucleotide sequence encoding residues 27–320 of YidC was deleted using the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (Finnzymes) with the primers YidCΔ27–320-fw and YidCΔ27–320-rv. To construct the plasmid pCMM-116HbpTAG41, a PCR fragment was generated using pC4Meth-ssHbp (8Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol.

The resulting fragment was cloned into pCMM (15Houben E.N. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using the EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites, yielding pCMM-116Hbp. To allow in vitro photocross-linking, a single amber codon (TAG) was introduced at position 41 by nested PCR as described previously (16Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L.

In vitro translation, photocross-linking, and sodium carbonate extraction were carried out as described (16Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 34Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E.

Samples were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitated first using 3-fold the amount used for direct analysis. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 473. The unusual signal peptides that are found in a large subset of ATs are thought to modulate the rate at which ATs are transferred into the periplasm. Recent work suggested that these peptides transit through the Sec translocon relatively slowly and/or transiently tether the AT to the IM (4Chevalier N. Moser M. Koch H.G. Schimz K.L. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Müller M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 8: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Szabady R.L. Peterson J.H. Skillman K.M. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Conceivably, these signal peptides direct atypical routing through the Sec translocon. In a previous study, we investigated the molecular environment of the signal peptide of Hbp during membrane insertion using an in vitro translation and cross-linking approach. Molecular interactions of nascent Hbp were fixed using the homo-bifunctional lysine-specific cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate, demonstrating contacts with SecA and the translocon component SecY (8Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Of note, previous work from our group on the biogenesis of the IMP FtsQ suggested that, although disuccinimidyl suberate can be used effectively to reveal contacts between substrate proteins and hydrophilic exposed regions of IMPs, it seems less suited to probe contacts with IMPs that take place strictly within the lipid bilayer (16Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 34Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A.

This is probably due to relative paucity of lysine residues in the TMs of IMPs. Therefore, we considered it opportune to reanalyze the molecular contacts of the Hbp signal peptide during membrane insertion using an unbiased site-specific in vitro translation and photocross-linking approach (16Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this approach, radiolabeled translation intermediates of specific length (nascent chains) are produced from truncated mRNA in a cell- and membrane-free E. coli lysate. During translation, a carbene generating photoreactive cross-linking probe is introduced site-specifically using previously described (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup technology (35Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 142-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The highly reactive carbene is known to attack neighboring molecules irrespective of their chemical nature (35Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 142-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Brunner J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 628-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A 116-amino acid-long Hbp nascent chain (116Hbp) was synthesized that is identical to the construct used in a previous study (8Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At this length, the signal peptide is exposed outside the ribosome to provide optimal targeting information (Fig. 1A). Translation was carried out in the presence of purified inverted inner membrane vesicles derived from wild-type E. coli cells to allow membrane insertion of the Hbp 116-mer and generation of an Hbp translocation intermediate. To probe the molecular contacts of Hbp during membrane translocation, a photoreactive probe was introduced at position 41 (TAG41) of the signal peptide, in the middle of the hydrophobic core (Fig. 1A). After translation, one-half of the sample was irradiated with UV light to induce cross-linking, whereas the other half was kept in the dark to serve as a negative control. Irradiation of 116HbpTAG41 resulted in two prominent cross-linking adducts of ∼60–70 kDa (Fig. 1B). To gain insight into the nature of the cross-linking adducts, the UV-irradiated sample was extracted with sodium carbonate to separate the membrane integrated from the peripheral membrane and soluble proteins (Fig. 1C). Approximately 50% of nascent Hbp was detected in the carbonate pellet (Fig. 1C, cf. lanes 1 and 4), indicating efficient targeting to the inverted inner membrane vesicles as described previously (8Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the slower migrating adduct that appeared upon UV irradiation (Fig. 1B, lane 2) was detected in the carbonate pellet fraction (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Immunoprecipitation using an antiserum against the accessory translocon component YidC identified this protein as the cross-linked partner (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Consistently, the molecular mass of the adduct corresponded to the added molecular mass of the Hbp nascent chain (∼13 kDa) and YidC (∼62 kDa). As a control, immunoprecipitation using antiserum against SecY did not precipitate the prominent ∼70-kDa adduct, but a faint ∼40-kDa band representing minor cross-linking to SecY (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Similar to other cross-linking studies, a ∼25-kDa adduct was also precipitated using SecY antiserum, which has been suggested to represent a degradation product (34Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 37Houben E.N. Urbanus M.L.

In the carbonate supernatant fraction containing nontargeted material (Fig. 1C, lane 4), a cross-linking adduct similar in size to the YidC adduct was detected. Immunoprecipitation showed that this adduct represented cross-linking to TF (Fig. 1C, lane 5), a cytosolic chaperone with a general affinity for nascent polypeptide chains (38Ullers R.S. Houben E.N. Brunner J. Oudega B. Harms N. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13999-14005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The most prominent adduct, however, was precipitated using an antiserum against fifty-four homologue (Fig. 1C, lane 6), the protein component of the SRP, reflecting incomplete release of SRP from nascent Hbp under the conditions tested. This confirms earlier data in which TF and SRP were specifically cross-linked to 116Hbp using the lysine-specific bifunctional cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (7Jong W.S. Luirink J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the present, site-specific data demonstrate that both TF and SRP are close to the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide at this stage in biogenesis. Importantly, the cross-linking data now show that upon membrane insertion of 116Hbp, the Hbp signal peptide is in close vicinity of YidC. Taken together with data that show cross-linking of 116Hbp to SecA/SecY in the membrane and fifty-four homologue in the cytosol (Fig. 1C) (7Jong W.S. Luirink J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol.

(2007) Nature 450, 515–521), we identified two mutants in transmembrane domains MalF and MalG that generated futile cycling; although interaction with MBP stimulated the ATPase activity of the transporter, maltose was not transported. Both mutants appeared to disrupt the normal transfer of maltose from MBP to MalFGK2. In the first case, substitution of aspartate for glycine in the maltose-binding site of MalF likely generated a futile cycle by preventing maltose from binding to MalFGK2 during the catalytic cycle. In the second case, a four-residue deletion of a periplasmic loop of MalG limited its reach into the maltose-binding pocket of MBP, allowing maltose to remain associated with MBP during the catalytic cycle. Retention of maltose in the MBP binding site in the deletion mutant, as well as insertion of this loop into the binding site in the wild type, was detected by EPR as a change in mobility of a nitroxide spin label positioned near the maltose-binding pocket of MBP. Members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily couple the energy from ATP hydrolysis to the active transport of substrates across the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2145508430,"Moths use ultrasounds as well as pheromones for sexual communication. In closely related moth species, variations in ultrasounds and pheromones are likely to profoundly affect mate recognition, reproductive isolation, and speciation. The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, and its Asian congeners, Ostrinia furnacalis and Ostrinia scapulalis, exhibit within-species and between-species variation in their pheromone communication. Recently, we reported ultrasound communication in O. furnacalis; however, variations in ultrasounds in the three congeners have not been addressed to date. Here we investigated features of ultrasound production and hearing in O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis, and compared them with those of O. furnacalis. As in O. furnacalis, males of O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis produced ultrasounds during courtship by rubbing specialized scales on the wings against scales on the thorax. The covering of these scales with nail polish muffled the sounds and significantly reduced mating success in O. nubilalis, showing the importance of ultrasound signaling in mating. The ultrasounds produced by O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis were similar, consisting of long trains of pairs of pulses with a main energy at 40 kHz, but distinctly different from the ultrasound produced by O. furnacalis, consisting of groups of pulses peaking at 50 kHz and with substantially more energy up to 80 kHz. Despite overall similarities, temporal features and patterns of amplitude modulation differed significantly among the geographic populations of O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis, which differed in pheromone type. In contrast, no significant difference in hearing was found among the three species with regard to the most sensitive frequencies and hearing threshold levels. The patterns of variations in the songs and pheromones well reflected those of the phylogenetic relationships, implying that ultrasound and pheromone communications have diverged concordantly. Our results suggest that concordant evolution in sexual signals such as courtship ultrasounds and sex pheromones occurs in moths."
https://openalex.org/W1970780198,"A major group of murine inhibitory receptors on Natural Killer (NK) cells belong to the Ly49 receptor family and recognize MHC class I molecules. Infected or transformed target cells frequently downmodulate MHC class I molecules and can thus avoid CD8(+) T cell attack, but may at the same time develop NK cell sensitivity, due to failure to express inhibitory ligands for Ly49 receptors. The extent of MHC class I downregulation needed on normal cells to trigger NK cell effector functions is not known.In this study, we show that cells expressing MHC class I to levels well below half of the host level are tolerated in an in vivo assay in mice. Hemizygous expression (expression from only one allele) of MHC class I was sufficient to induce Ly49 receptor downmodulation on NK cells to a similar degree as homozygous expression, despite a strongly reduced cell surface level of MHC class I. Co-expression of weaker MHC class I ligands in the host did not have any further effect on the degree of Ly49 downmodulation. Furthermore, a single MHC class I allele could downmodulate up to three Ly49 receptors on individual NK cells. Only when NK cells simultaneously expressed several Ly49 receptors and hemizygous MHC class I levels, a putative threshold for Ly49 downmodulation was reached.Collectively, our findings suggest that in interactions between NK cells and normal untransformed cells, MHC class I molecules are in most cases expressed in excess compared to what is functionally needed to ensure self tolerance and to induce maximal Ly49 downmodulation. We speculate that the reason for this is to maintain a safety margin for otherwise normal, autologous cells over a range of MHC class I expression levels, in order to ensure robustness in NK cell tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2094743955,"Although the mechanisms that regulate folding and maturation of newly synthesized G protein-coupled receptors are crucial for their function, they remain poorly characterized. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we have isolated ANKRD13C, a protein of unknown function, as an interacting partner for the DP receptor for prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>. In the present study we report the characterization of this novel protein as a regulator of DP biogenesis and trafficking in the biosynthetic pathway. Co-localization by confocal microscopy with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, subcellular fractionation experiments, and demonstration of the interaction between ANKRD13C and the cytoplasmic C terminus of DP suggest that ANKRD13C is a protein associated with the cytosolic side of ER membranes. Co-expression of ANKRD13C with DP initially increased receptor protein levels, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous ANKRD13C decreased them. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that ANKRD13C can promote the biogenesis of DP by inhibiting the degradation of newly synthesized receptors. However, a prolonged interaction between ANKRD13C and DP resulted in ER retention of misfolded/unassembled forms of the receptor and to their proteasome-mediated degradation. ANKRD13C also regulated the expression of other GPCRs tested (CRTH2, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TPα), and β2-adrenergic receptor), whereas it did not affect the expression of green fluorescent protein, GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2), and VSVG (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein), showing specificity toward G protein-coupled receptors. Altogether, these results suggest that ANKRD13C acts as a molecular chaperone for G protein-coupled receptors, regulating their biogenesis and exit from the ER."

Double heterozygous α-crystallin knock-out αA(+/−) αB(+/−) mice with a decreased amount of α-crystallins were used to simulate reduced total α-crystallin chaperone-like activity in vivo. We found that triple heterozygous αA(+/−) αB(+/−) γB(I4F/+) mice developed more severe whole cataracts than heterozygous γB(I4F/+) mice. Thus, total chaperone-like activity of α-crystallins is important for maintaining lens transparency.

The recent crystal structure of the RGS9·Gβ5 complex indicates that Gβ5 has three distinct interactions with R7 proteins as follows: in addition to marginal contacts with the RGS domain, it forms extensive contacts with the GGL and the DEP domains (13Cheever M.L.

The mechanisms that alter R7 RGS abundance remain unclear, but any mechanism that dynamically regulates protein abundance requires protein turnover. Given the sensitivity of R7 RGS proteins to degradation, their turnover may in fact be the regulated step. In this study, we have used the power of C. elegans genetics to identify an unusual mutation in Gβ5/GBP-2 that preferentially affects the stability of EAT-16 over EGL-10, resulting in a characteristic hyperactive phenotype caused by enhanced Gαq signaling. Interestingly, previous genetic screens reported several mutations in Gβ5/GBP-2 with similar functional properties but unexplained mechanisms (20Robatzek M. Niacaris T. Steger K. Avery L. Thomas J.H.

Our analysis shows that all of the identified “hyperactive” mutations are in residues conserved in mammals and disrupt the Gβ5-DEP interface, which serves as the hot spot for the regulation of complex stability.

A combination of three-factor mapping and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis further positioned vs33 between two visible markers at 0.00 (dpy-5) and 3.30 (unc-29). Subsequent sequencing of candidate G protein signaling genes within this region identified a 3-bp deletion in gpb-2 that eliminates the Asp-263 codon. Egg laying assays were performed as described previously (26Chase D.L. Koelle M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine the number of unlaid eggs, adult animals were dissolved in bleach and the number of bleach-resistant eggs counted. To determine the percentage of eggs laid at each developmental stage, adult animals were allowed to lay eggs for 30 min, and the eggs were visually inspected. In the unlaid egg assay, 30 animals per genotype were analyzed, and the mean and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. In the developmental stage assay, ≥100 eggs per strain were analyzed, and 95% confidence intervals and p values were calculated using Wilson's estimates. Precisely staged adults for both assays were obtained by isolating late L4 larvae and aging for 30 h at 20 °C. To qualitatively analyze locomotion and foraging, individual worms were filmed moving across a bacterial lawn with a digital video camera attached to a Leica M420 dissecting microscope. Tracks were traced manually. To visualize morphology, worms were imaged on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Cloning of full-length Gβ5, R7BP, RGS7, and RGS9-2 was described previously (27Anderson G.R.

To generate N-terminal HA-tagged RGS7 (HA-RGS7), the RGS7 cDNA was cloned into the pCMV-HA vector. Gβ5-D260A, Gβ5-C263Y, and Gβ5-D304N mutants were generated using the single site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions.

The N-terminal AU5-tagged Gβ5 wild-type and mutant (AU5-Gβ5, AU5-Gβ5D260A, and AU5-Gβ5C263Y) fragments were amplified with AU5-Gβ5 (sense), 5′-ATGACAGACTTTTACCTCAAAGCAACCGATGGGCTGCAC, and Gβ5 (antisense), 5′-TTATGCCCAAACTCTTAGGG paired primers. The N-terminal fragment of RGS9 (amino acids 1–209) with c-myc tag at the C terminus was amplified using the following paired primers: RGS9 (sense), 5′-ATGACGATCCGACACCAAGG, and RGS9 (antisense), 5′-TCACAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTTTGTTCCATGGTCACGCGGTCCAGGCCGT. The C-terminal fragment of RGS9-1 (amino acids 210–484) with HA tag at the C terminus was amplified using the following primers: RGS9CT (sense), 5′-ATGAATCCAAACGAAGTTAAGAA, and RGS9-1CTHA (antisense), 5′-TCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATTTTAGGAGGCAGCTCCTTTTTG. All PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector according to the manufacturer's specifications. Constructs were propagated in the Escherichia coli Top-10 strain (Invitrogen), isolated using Maxiprep kits (Qiagen), and sequenced. PhLP1 containing the C-terminal c-myc tag (pcDNA3.1) was kindly provided by Dr. Barry Willardson (Brigham Young University). HEK293FT cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 4 mm l-glutamine. Cells were transfected at 70% confluency using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were grown for 24–48 h post-transfection. C. elegans liquid cultures were grown at 20 °C and isolated by flotation on 30% sucrose. Packed worm pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed either by sonication (pellets ≤0.5 ml), as described previously (9Porter M.Y. Koelle M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 232-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or passaged three times through a French press at 800 p.s.i. (pellets ≥0.5 ml). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using BSA as a standard. Mammalian cells from 1 well of a 6-well plate were lysed in 500 μl of PBS buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For the immunoprecipitation, supernatants were incubated with a specific antibody as indicated, and 20 μl of 50% protein G slurry (GE healthcare) on a rocker at 4 °C for 1 h. After three washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from beads with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. Proteins in the eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes, and probed with the indicated specific primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase.

Nonet, Washington University); and mouse anti-β-tubulin (E7, DSHB, University of Iowa). Experiments to evaluate the stability of RGS proteins to proteolytic degradation were performed in HEK293FT cells as described previously (28Cao Y. Masuho I. Okawa H. Xie K. Asami J. Kammermeier P.J. Maddox D.M. Furukawa T. Inoue T. Sampath A.P. Martemyanov K.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9301-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HEK293FT cells grown in T-25 flasks were transfected with RGS constructs with or without wild-type or mutant Gβ5 constructs. For assays involving RGS9, R7BP was additionally co-transfected. Total cDNAs were 5 μg per flask. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS, placed into 5 ml of starvation medium (10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), DMEM without l-methionine or l-cysteine (21013-024, Invitrogen)), and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Subsequently, newly synthesizing proteins were labeled by adding 175 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (NEG772; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per flask to the starvation medium and incubating at 37 °C for 40 min. Cells were rinsed twice with 2 ml of DMEM and incubated with 5 ml of complete medium supplemented by additional 2 mm l-methionine and 2 mm l-cysteine (Sigma) at 37 °C for the indicated incubation times. At the end of the incubation, the cells were scraped into 5 ml of ice-chilled PBS, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 900 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science). After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C, the suspension was then centrifuged at 4 °C and 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of protein G beads slurry and 3 μg of RGS9-2 CT antibody or HA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was air-dried and incubated on a phosphorimaging screen overnight. This screen was then scanned using a STORM phosphorimager (GE Healthcare), and the bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Each experiment was repeated at least twice. RGS7, RGS9-2, and wild-type Gβ5 recombinant baculoviruses were described previously (29Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

Mutant Gβ5 constructs (Gβ5-D260A and Gβ5-C263Y) were used to generate recombinant baculoviruses using the BaculoDirect C-terminal expression kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's manual. Proteins were expressed in Sf-9 cells, and protein complexes were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography taking advantage of the His tag engineered at the N terminus of RGS proteins as described previously (29Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-tagged R7BP protein was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (30Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4772-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified recombinant GST fusion R7BP or GST control protein (0.25 μm) and purified R7 RGS-Gβ5 proteins (0.25 μm) were co-incubated with 20 μl of 50% glutathione-agarose bead slurry (GE Healthcare) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.25% n-dodecanoylsucrose, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with binding buffer three times. Proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, and proteins present in the eluates were detected by immunoblotting with anti-RGS7 (7RC1), anti-Gβ5 (ATDG), and anti-R7BP (NT) antibodies. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS (31Hess B.C. Kutzner D. van der Spoel Lindahl E. J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 2008; 4: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (12438) Google Scholar). An identical procedure was used for all the models studied in this work and consisted of the following steps. A model with generated hydrogens was placed in a box of appropriate size and fully solvated. Protonation states of ionizable groups were assigned based on analysis of hydrogen bonding patterns. Sufficient numbers of sodium and chloride ions were placed in random positions to emulate physiological ionic strength (150 mm) and to neutralize the overall charge of the system. The fully solvated model was subjected to energy minimization followed by 20-ps simulation with protein atoms restrained to their positions in the crystal structure to allow water relaxation. Finally, 100-ps unrestrained simulation was performed at 300 K. Snapshots were obtained every 500 fs, and it was found that initial equilibration period did not exceed 30 ps (as judged by overall root mean square deviation of aligned models). The second half of the unrestrained simulation was used for analysis. To further our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate G protein signaling, we performed a genetic screen for animals hyperactive for egg laying, a behavior controlled by R7 RGS·Gβ5 complexes (23Bany I.A. Genetic and Cellular Analysis of the Inhibition of Egg Laying in Caenorhabditis elegans, Ph.D. thesis. Yale University, New Haven, CT2004Google Scholar). We identified a novel allele, vs33, and mapped it to a small interval on chromosome I containing the gene gpb-2/Gβ5. This mutation deletes the codon for aspartate 263 from this gene. Wild-type animals hold their fertilized eggs in utero for a few hours while the embryos develop past the eight-cell stage. As a result, wild-type animals accumulate 9.1 ± 0.6 eggs in utero and lay only 12.3 ± 6.4% of their eggs at an early developmental stage of less than eight cells (Fig. 1B). Wild-type animals also move across a bacterial lawn in a sinusoidal wave, make few reversals, and forage over much of the available bacterial lawn (Fig. 1C). These behaviors are the result of a balance between the opposing effects of Gαo and Gαq signaling (Fig. 1D). GPB-2/Gβ5 is an essential subunit of the two C. elegans R7 RGS proteins, EGL-10 and EAT-16, which inhibit Gαo and Gαq signaling, respectively (12Chase D.L. Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 222-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Robatzek M. Niacaris T. Steger K. Avery L. Thomas J.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 288-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32van der Linden A.M. Simmer F. Cuppen E. Plasterk R.H. Genetics. 2001; 158: 221-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In animals lacking GPB-2/Gβ5, there is no inhibition of Gαo or Gαq, and signaling by both G proteins is increased (Fig. 1G). However, as this does not alter the net balance of signaling, gpb-2(null) mutants appear grossly wild type in appearance and behavior. Consistent with previously published data, we observed that gpb-2(null) mutants accumulate 6.1 ± 0.8 eggs in utero, lay only 16.0 ± 7.3% of their eggs at an early developmental stage (Fig. 1E), and exhibit locomotion and foraging behavior similar to that of wild-type animals (Fig. 1F). In surprising contrast to gpb-2(null) mutants, we found that gpb-2(vs33) mutants are strongly hyperactive for egg laying and locomotion behaviors. gpb-2(vs33) animals lay their eggs almost as soon as they are fertilized and thus accumulate only 2.3 ± 0.3 unlaid eggs and lay 88.5 ± 6.3% of their eggs at an early developmental stage (Fig. 1H). In addition, gpb-2(vs33) mutants move with much deeper body bends than wild-type animals, make more reversals, and restrict their foraging to a smaller area of the bacterial lawn (Fig. 1I). gpb-2(vs33) mutants are also thin and pale compared with the wild-type or gpb-2(null) animals (Fig. 1, B, E, and H). Finally, whereas wild-type animals are paralyzed by exogenously applied serotonin and dopamine (26Chase D.L. Koelle M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Ranganathan R. Cannon S.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2000; 408: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), gpb-2(vs33) mutants but not gpb-2(null) animals are resistant to these effects (data not shown). The defects exhibited by gpb-2(vs33) animals are characteristic of animals in which either signaling by the inhibitory G protein, Gαo, is decreased or signaling by the stimulatory G protein, Gαq, is increased (Fig. 1J). Interestingly, two other point mutations in gpb-2, the alleles sa833 and sa604, have been reported to cause the very same set of defects as observed in the gpb-2(vs33) mutants (supplemental Table 2) (20Robatzek M. Niacaris T. Steger K. Avery L. Thomas J.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 288-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have named these gpb-2(hyp) mutations. To determine whether the behavioral defects seen in gpb-2(hyp) mutants are the result of decreased Gαo signaling or increased Gαq signaling, we first took a genetic approach. We hypothesized that gpb-2(hyp) mutations may either increase EGL-10 activity, causing decreased inhibitory Gαo signaling, or may decrease EAT-16 activity, resulting in increased stimulatory Gαq signaling. To distinguish between these alternatives, we combined each gpb-2(hyp) mutation with a null allele of egl-10. If the gpb-2(hyp) mutations increase EGL-10 activity, then in the absence of EGL-10 they should have no effect, and the double mutants should phenocopy egl-10(null) single mutants. However, if gpb-2(hyp) mutants decrease EAT-16 activity, resulting in increased Gαq signaling, then in the absence of EGL-10, Gαo signaling will also be increased to restore the balance of signaling, as in gpb-2(null) mutants, so that the double mutants should resemble both wild-type and gpb-2(null) animals. We analyzed the stage of the eggs laid by each strain, and these data are presented in Fig. 2. We first observed the egg laying behavior of a number of control strains and classified the eggs laid by these animals as follows: early stage, less than eight cells; normal stage, nine cells to pre-comma; late-stage, comma and later (Fig. 2A). We found that the majority of eggs (84%) laid by wild-type animals were in the normal range of stages (Fig. 2B, bar 1), whereas 100% of eggs laid by egl-10(null) mutants, in which inhibitory Gαo signaling is increased, were of a late stage (Fig. 2B, bar 2). We next examined two hyperactive egg-laying mutants, an EGL-10-overexpressing strain, in which inhibitory Gαo signaling is strongly inhibited, and an eat-16(null) mutant in which stimulatory Gαq signaling is increased. We observed that both strains lay the majority of their eggs (66 and 79%, respectively) at early developmental stages (Fig. 2B, bars 3 and 4). Finally, we combined the hyperactive eat-16(null) mutation (too much Gαq signaling) with the egl-10(null) mutation (too much Gαo signaling), and as predicted we found these animals had a statistically significant decrease in the number of early stage eggs laid and now laid a majority (93%) of normal stage eggs (Fig. 2B, bar 5), similar to gpb-2(null) mutants and to wild-type animals. Next, we put all three gpb-2(hyp) mutations through our genetic analysis. We found that all three single mutants laid the majority of their eggs at an early developmental stage as follows: vs33, 88%; sa833, 83%; sa604, 72% (Fig. 2B, bars 6, 8, and 10). However, when combined with the egl-10(null) mutation, all three double mutants exhibited dramatic and"

The latter is designated ΔNp63. Because of several alternative splicing events, TP63 produces three isoforms with various lengths of the C terminus (α, β, and γ). ΔNp63α is the longest TP63 protein among the ΔNp63 isoforms and is the most predominant isoform expressed in HNSCC cells (35.Huang Y.P. Kim Y. Li Z. Fomenkov T. Fomenkov A. Ratovitski E.A.

RPN13 gene promoter and 5′-deletion sequences (−1750/+50, −1280/+50, −1192/+50, −1043/+50, −901/+50, −608/+50, and −331/+50 bp) were amplified using the following primer pairs: 5′-TGACAGTCAAAAGCTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTGCCAGGCTCTCGGGG-3′ (antisense); 5′-GAGTGCAGTGGTGCCAAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTGCCAGGCTCTCGGGG-3′ (antisense); 5′-CAAGTAATCCGCCCGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTGCCAGGCTCTCGGGG-3′ (antisense); 5′-GAGCCACCGCGCCTGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTGCCAGGCTCTCGGGG-3′ (antisense); 5′-GTTACACAACACTGGCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTGCCAGGCTCTCGGGG-3′ (antisense); 5′-TCCCGGACCCACCCCTTCCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTGCCAGGCTCTCGGGG-3′ (antisense); and 5′-GGCGGGCGACGCCGAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGTGCCAGGCTCTCGGGG-3′ (antisense). The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the MluI and XhoI sites or HindIII site of the promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter expression vector (Promega) as described previously (34.Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y. Yamashita K. Fomenkov A. Kim M.S. Wu G. Nomoto S. Trink B. Sidransky D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6077-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A PCR SuperMix High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen) was used for amplification (34.Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y. Yamashita K. Fomenkov A. Kim M.S. Wu G. Nomoto S. Trink B. Sidransky D. Mol. Cell.

All constructs were sequenced from the 5′- and 3′-ends. 5 × 104 cells were plated per well in a 24-well plate. pGL3 luciferase reporter constructs (100 ng; Promega) and Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-SV40 (1 ng; Promega) were introduced into cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (34.Osada M.

For each experimental trial, wells were transfected in triplicate, and each well was assayed in triplicate. Luciferase activity was normalized to the activity produced from the empty vector. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, 10 μl was added to 50 μl of firefly luciferase substrate, and light units were measured in a luminometer. Renilla luciferase activities were measured in the same tube after the addition of 50 μl of Stop & Glo reagent. Values for the firefly luciferase activity were divided by the Renilla luciferase activity to normalize for differences caused by unequal transfection efficiency (34.Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y.

RT-PCR was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) for 24–30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s as described previously (34.Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y.

As a control, we amplified the GAPDH mRNA with primers 5′-CTACATGGTTTACATGT-3′ (sense, +121) and 5′-TGCCCTCAACGACCACT-3′ (antisense, +920), yielding the 800-bp PCR product. For RPN13 amplification, we used primers 5′-TCATCTTCCCTGACGACTG-3′ (sense, +301) and 5′-GCCTGCTGGGAAACATGA-3′ (antisense, +570), yielding the 270-bp PCR product. A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was performed using the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system kit (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green Universal PCR Master Mix. The same primers described above were used. Values for RPN13 were normalized to values for GAPDH, and values obtained from the control untreated samples were designated as 1. Experiments were performed in triplicate. 5 × 106 cell eq of chromatin (2–2.5 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size) were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of anti-phospho-ΔNp63α antibody as described (34.Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y. Yamashita K. Fomenkov A. Kim M.S. Wu G. Nomoto S. Trink B. Sidransky D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6077-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 37.Huang Y.P. Chuang A. Romano R. Wu G. Sinha S. Legecous N. Ratovitski E.A. Sidransky D. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 332-342Google Scholar). After reversal of formaldehyde cross-linking and RNase A and proteinase K treatments, immunoprecipitate-enriched DNAs were used for PCR amplification. PCR consisted of 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s using Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR primers used for ChIP were as follows: for the TP63-responsive element, 5′-TGGGGTGCAGAGGCCACT-3′ (sense, −1400) and 5′-CCAGGCTGGTCTTGAACT-3′ (antisense, −1120); for the NF-κB-responsive element, 5′-TGAGCCCTCTAAGAGCC-3′ (sense, −1030) and 5′-GACCCCTCCCTTCCAGACCT-3′ (antisense, −810); for the NF-κB-responsive element, 5′-GACTCCACCCCTCCCAGA-3′ (sense, −750) and 5′-ACAGCTGAGACCATATCA-3′ (antisense, −530); for the TP63-responsive element, 5′-CTGACCCCTGCCCTCCCG-A-3′ (sense, −590) and 5′-CCGTCTCCCCTATGACAC-A-3′ (antisense, −210); and for the NF-Y-responsive element, 5′-GTCCAAGCGCCCTACAGC-3′ (sense, −190) and 5′-CAGGATGACGACCTCAGGCT-3′ (antisense, +90). As a negative control, the binding of TF was tested with the nonspecific region primers representing the RPN13 ORF (+301 to +570). To quantify the binding of TFs to the RPN13 gene promoter sequences, we used qPCR with the abovementioned primers for various TFs. ChIP-PCR values were normalized to GAPDH values. For each TF, values obtained from the input samples were designated as 1. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 107 cells using guanidine isothiocyanate lysis buffer (TRIzol, Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was subsequently isolated using biotinylated oligo(dT) primers and streptavidin coupled to magnetic beads (PolyATract, Promega). The RiboClone cDNA synthesis system (Promega) was then used to convert 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA into cDNA. For hybridization, 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The 1.3-kbp RPN13 cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Invitrogen) and used to hybridize the filter. The filter was then autoradiographed for 16 h on Kodak XAR film at −80 °C. A human placenta genomic library in the Lambda FIX II vector (946207, Stratagene) was screened with a 1.3-kbp cDNA probe encoding full-length human RPN13 (28.Shimada S. Ogawa M. Takahashi M. Schlom J. Greiner J.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3831-3836PubMed Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 1 × 106 plaques were screened, yielding three positive clones. To screen clones by PCR, we then used the following primer pair from the 5′-part of the RPN13 ORF: 5′-ACCGTGACTCCGGATAAGCGGA-3′ (sense, 109–130) and 5′-CTGCATCCAGAAGAAAAGCC-3′ (antisense, 330 to 311). One clone was found positive. Lambda FIX phage DNA was isolated from this clone and digested with EcoRI, XbaI, and PstI. One EcoRI fragment (3.8 kbp), four XbaI fragments (3.0, 2.3, 1.7, and 1.4 kbp), and two PstI fragments (5.5 and 4.2 kbp) were subcloned into the pBluescript SKII+ vector (Stratagene). To map the transcription start site (TSS), the 5′-end of the RPN13 mRNA was cloned after 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE; Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA for 5′-RACE was reversed-transcribed using the RPN13-specific primer 5′-GCCATTATCTCCGGCGTCAG-3′ (+894 to +875) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 52 °C. Gene-specific cDNA was PCR-amplified using the RPN13-specific primer 5′-GCCGCTGGCCCCC-AGTGCCCCAGG-3′ (+423 to +400) and the universal 5′-RACE anchor primer 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGGGGGGGG-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pCR3.1 vector and sequenced. The primer extension assay was carried out by reverse transcription of 10 μg of total RNA using the 32P-labeled primer 5′-CTTCAGGGACATCTTTCCCGCCCG-3′ (positions +101 to +79 of the RPN13 ORF). Annealing was carried out for 10 min at 70 °C. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction product was treated with DNase-free RNase at 37 °C for 15 min. Extension products were resolved on an 8% sequencing gel. As negative controls, we used tRNA and a sample without RNA. Cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4,) 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm tetrahydrobiopterin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm PMSF, 10 μm FMN, and 10 μm FAD. A reaction mixture was made of cell lysate containing 50 μg of protein, 50 μl of [U-14C]arginine (50,000 cpm), 5 μl of 5 mm FAD, 5 μl of 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, and 1 μl of 30 μm calmodulin, and the volume was brought up to 250 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 10 mm NADPH, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and applied to a Dowex 50W-H+ column, and the flow-through was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (21.Ratovitski E.A.

Using the mRNA expression array and ChIP-on-chip array, we previously showed that exposure of HNSCC cells to 10 μg/ml cisplatin for 16 h leads to up-regulation of many mRNA transcripts associated with the DNA damage, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways (37.Huang Y.P. Chuang A. Romano R. Wu G. Sinha S. Legecous N. Ratovitski E.A. Sidransky D. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 332-342Google Scholar). Among these mRNA targets, we found RPN13 (also known ADRM1). We previously showed that cisplatin treatment induces the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of ΔNp63α, subsequently modulating various genes implicated in cell survival (33.Fomenkov A. Zangen R.

Using the isogenic HNSCC cell lines expressing wild-type ΔNp63α or ΔNp63α-S385G (ΔNp63α with an altered ability to be phosphorylated by ATM kinase), we previously showed the failure of ΔNp63α-S385G to regulate gene transcription (36.Huang Y.

Ratovitski E.A. Sidransky D. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 332-342Google Scholar). We first found that cisplatin treatment substantially increased the RPN13 mRNA levels in wild-type ΔNp63α cells but not in ΔNp63α-S385G cells as shown by RT-PCR assay (Fig. 1A). By qPCR, we further found that cisplatin treatment increased the RPN13 mRNA levels in wild-type ΔNp63α cells by 12.4 ± 0.9-fold (Fig. 1B). Upon inspection of the 1.5-kbp RPN13 promoter sequence (UCSC Genome Bioinformatics) using TFSEARCH software, we observed that the specific TF cognate sequences are present in the 1.5-kbp human RPN13 promoter (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Schematic representation of the human RPN13 gene promoter. The sequence of the human 1500-bp RPN13 promoter was found on the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics human genome web site, and certain potential TF-responsive elements (RE) were defined using TFSEARCH software.

https://openalex.org/W1985981101,"The core lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Proteus mirabilis as well as those of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens are characterized by the presence of a hexosamine-galacturonic acid disaccharide (αHexN-(1,4)-αGalA) attached by an α1,3 linkage to l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose II (l-glycero-α-d-manno-heptosepyranose II). In K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and some P. mirabilis strains, HexN is d-glucosamine, whereas in other P. mirabilis strains, it corresponds to d-galactosamine. Previously, we have shown that two enzymes are required for the incorporation of d-glucosamine into the core LPS of K. pneumoniae; the WabH enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to outer core LPS, and WabN catalyzes the deacetylation of the incorporated GlcNAc. Here we report the presence of two different HexNAc transferases depending on the nature of the HexN in P. mirabilis core LPS. In vivo and in vitro assays using LPS truncated at the level of galacturonic acid as acceptor show that these two enzymes differ in their specificity for the transfer of GlcNAc or GalNAc. By contrast, only one WabN homologue was found in the studied P. mirabilis strains. Similar assays suggest that the P. mirabilis WabN homologue is able to deacetylate both GlcNAc and GalNAc. We conclude that incorporation of d-galactosamine requires three enzymes: Gne epimerase for the generation of UDP-GalNAc from UDP-GlcNAc, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (WabP), and LPS:HexNAc deacetylase.

This bacterium is found more frequently than Escherichia coli in kidney infection (5Fairley K.F. Carson N.E. Gutch R.C. Leighton P. Grounds A.D. Laird E.C. McCallum P.H. Sleeman R.L. O'Keefe C.M.

As in other Enterobacteriaceae, in the genus Proteus LPS, three domains are recognized: the highly conserved and hydrophobic lipid A; the hydrophilic and highly variable O-antigen polysaccharide (O-PS) 3The abbreviations used are: O-PSO-antigen polysaccharideGalAgalacturonic acidGalNd-galactosamineGlcNd-glucosamineHexNd-hexosamineKdo3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acidOSoligosaccharide(s)TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinecontiggroup of overlapping clones. with more than 60 serogroups recognized (7Larsson P.

The core domain is usually divided into inner and outer core on the basis of sugar composition. O-antigen polysaccharide galacturonic acid d-galactosamine d-glucosamine d-hexosamine 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid oligosaccharide(s) N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine group of overlapping clones. The core OS structure of 34 Proteus strains of different O-serogroups has been determined (11Vinogradov E. Sidorczyk Z. Knirel Y.A. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 61-67Crossref Google Scholar). The core OS of these strains share a common heptasaccharide fragment that includes a 3-deoxy-α-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) disaccharide, a l-glycero-α-d-manno-heptosepyranose trisaccharide, and one residue each of Glc, GalA, and either d-glucosamine (GlcN) or d-galactosamine (GalN) (Fig. 1) (reviewed in Ref. 11Vinogradov E. Sidorczyk Z. Knirel Y.A. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 61-67Crossref Google Scholar). This common fragment is also found in the core LPS of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens (12Vinogradov E.

The rest of the Proteus core OS is quite variable, with up to 37 different structures recognized in the genus Proteus and 11 in P. mirabilis (11Vinogradov E. Sidorczyk Z. Knirel Y.A. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 61-67Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the P. mirabilis common core heptasaccharide for strains containing GlcN (R110 and 51/57) (16Aquilini E. Azevedo J. Jimenez N. Bouamama L. Tomás J.M. Regué M. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As in other Enterobacteriaceae, these genes were clustered in the so-called wa region, and among these genes, K. pneumoniae wabH and wabN homologues were found able to complement the corresponding non-polar mutants (16Aquilini E. Azevedo J. Jimenez N. Bouamama L. Tomás J.M. Regué M. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this work, we characterize the wa region for two P. mirabilis strains containing GalN instead of GlcN and present evidence for a specific GalNAc transferase in these strains. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table 1. Bacterial strains were grown in LB broth and LB agar (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar). LB medium was supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), tetracycline (20 μg/ml), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) when needed.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids usedStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicsReference or sourceStrains P. mirabilis 50/57Serogroup O27J.

Open table in a new tab Standard DNA manipulations were done essentially as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, E. coli DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment), and alkaline phosphatase were used as recommended by the suppliers. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by using the dideoxy-chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar) with the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oligonucleotides used for genomic DNA amplifications and DNA sequencing were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The DNA sequence was translated in all six frames, and all open reading frames (ORFs) were inspected. Deduced amino acid sequences were compared with those of DNA translated in all six frames from nonredundant GenBankTM and EMBL databases by using the BLAST (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A.

ClustalW was used for multiple-sequence alignments (21Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55709) Google Scholar). The wabHR110 (1137-bp) and wabNR110 (963-bp) genes from P. mirabilis R110 were PCR-amplified from strain R110 genomic DNA with oligonucleotide pairs BHf (5′-TGGCGATGGCAAATTTTACT-3′)-BHr (5′-ATTCCGGCCGATAACTTAGG-3′) and BNf (5′-GTGCACGAATTGCTCTGATG-3′)-BNr (5′-ATGGGTGGCAAGATAATGCT-3′), obtaining fragments of 1310 and 1508 bp, respectively. Similarly, the wabP50/57 and wabN50/57 were amplified from strain 50/57 genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 50-7 (5′-TAGCTGCAGCTATTTCAGCC-3′)-50-4 (5′-GGGATAATGGTGGCGTAATG-3′) and BNf-BBNr (5′-GGCTTTCCATTGGTCAGCTA-3′), obtaining fragments of 1881 and 1621 bp, respectively. These amplicons were ligated to vector pGEM-T (Promega) and transformed into E. coli DH5α to generate plasmids pGEM-T-wabHR110, pGEM-T-wabNR110, pGEM-T- wabP50/57, and pGEM-T- wabN50/57. A DNA fragment (1400 bp) containing the gne from P. mirabilis ATCC 29906 was amplified with oligonucleotides GneExtFw (5′-GAGCTCCCATGGTGAAATGAAACGTG-3′) and GneExtRv (5′-TCTAGAACCCGTATTCGGTGGAATTT-3′), where underlined letters denote sequences cut by SacI and XbaI, respectively. The amplified fragment was cloned in pGEM-T to obtain pGEM-T-GNEP. mirabilis. By SacI digestion, a 1454-bp fragment was obtained, gel-purified, and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase. This fragment was ligated to SalI-digested and blunt-ended pACYC184 to obtain pACYC-GNEP. mirabilis. To determine the distribution among several P. mirabilis strains of the gne gene an internal fragment of this gene was amplified using oligonucleotides GneIntFw (5′-ACTCGCCTATCAGGCCAATT-3′) and GneIntRev (5′-TGACTATGGCGTTTGTCGAG-3′). Oligonucleotide pairs WabHIntFw (5′-TGCCAACTCGATGGATAAGA-3′)-WabHIntRv (5′-GCGTAATTTTAGGCGGGTTA-3′) and WabPIntFw (5′-ACAACCTAACCCGTTTGCAG-3′)-WabPIntRv (5′-TCTGCGAGTGAGTCTGCATC-3′) were used to determine the distribution of wabH and wabP genes, respectively. LPS was extracted from dry cells grown in LB. The phenol/chloroform/light petroleum ether method (22Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) was used for strains producing rough LPS, whereas the phenol/water procedure (23Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) was used for the strains producing the O antigen domain (smooth LPS). For screening purposes, LPS was obtained after proteinase K digestion of whole cells (24Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS samples were separated by SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining as described previously (25Pradel E. Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6428-6431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar). The LPS preparations (20 mg) were hydrolyzed in 1% acetic acid (100 °C, 120 min), and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (8000 × g, 30 min) and lyophilized to give Lipid A. The supernatants were fractionated on a column (56 × 2.6 cm) of Sephadex G-50 (S) in 0.05 m pyridinium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, with monitoring using a differential refractometer to obtain the oligosaccharide fractions. Partially methylated alditol acetates and methyl glycoside acetates were analyzed on a Agilent Technologies 5973N MS instrument equipped with a 6850A gas chromatograph and an RTX-5 capillary column (Restek, 30 m × 0.25-mm inner diameter, flow rate 1 ml/min, helium as carrier gas). Acetylated methyl glycosides analysis was performed with the following temperature program: 150 °C for 5 min, 150 → 250 °C at 3 °C/min, 250 °C for 10 min. For partially methylated alditol acetates, the temperature program was as follows: 90 °C for 1 min, 90 → 140 °C at 25 °C/min, 140 → 200 °C at 5 °C/min, 200 → 280 °C at 10 °C/min, 280 °C for 10 min. Positive and negative ion reflectron time-of-flight mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) were acquired on a Voyager DE-PRO instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a delayed extraction ion source. Ion acceleration voltage was 25 kV, grid voltage was 17 kV, mirror voltage ratio was 1.12, and delay time was 150 ns. Samples were irradiated at a frequency of 5 Hz by 337-nm photons from a pulsed nitrogen laser. A solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenoic acid in 20% CH3CN in water at a concentration of 25 mg/ml was used as the MALDI matrix. One μl of matrix solution was deposited on the target, followed by loading of 1 μl of the sample. The droplets were allowed to dry at room temperature. Spectra were calibrated and processed under computer control using the Applied Biosystems Data Explorer software. Constructs allowing the expression of N-terminal histidine-tagged WabHR110 (His6-WabHR110), WabP50/57 (His6-WabP50/57), WabNR110 (His6-WabNR110), and WabN50/57 (His6-WabN50/57) were based in pET28a. The wabHR110 and wabP50/57 genes were amplified from pGEM-T-wabHR110 and pGEM-T-wabP50/57 with primer pairs HR1 (5′-ACGCCATATGAAGGAACATATACTTTTTATT-3′)-HR2 (5′-ACGCGGATCCTAAAACGTGTTCTGACTCATTATT-3′) and PR1 (5′-ACGCCATATGAATCAACGACATATACTTTTT-3′)-PR2 (5′-ACGCGGATCCAACATGCTATCAAATTCACTTATC), respectively. The wabNR110 and wabN50/57 genes were amplified from pGEM-T-wabNR110 and pGEM-T-wabN50/57 with primer pairs NR1 (5′-ACGCCATATGAAAAAACCAGCATTTATTATCAC-3′)-NR2 (5′-ACGCGGATCCAAAGAGTGGGTTATAGAGATTTA-3′) and NRR1 (5′-ACGCCATATGAAAAAACCAGCATTTATTATC-3′)-NRR2 (5′-ACGCGGATCCATAGTGCACCCATTTTAATTTC), respectively. The four amplified DNA fragments were digested with NdeI (double underlined nucleotides in HR1, PR1, NR1, and NRR1) and HindIII (double underlined nucleotides in HR2, PR2, NR2, and NRR2) and ligated to pET28a digested with the same enzymes to obtain plasmids pET28a-wabHR110, pET28a-wabP50/57, pET28a-wabNR110, and pET28a-wabN50/57. E. coli BL21(λD3) was used to overexpress genes from the T7 promoter in pET28a-based plasmids. The cultures were grown in LB supplemented with kanamycin for 18 h at 37 °C, diluted 1:100 in fresh medium, grown until they reached an A600 nm of about 0.5, induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 2 h. The cells from induced cultures were harvested, washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and frozen until used. To prepare the lysate cell pellets, they were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and sonicated on ice (for a total of 2 min using 10-s bursts followed by 10-s cooling periods). Unbroken cells, cell debris, and membrane fraction were removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Protein expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and protein contents of cell-free extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay. Cell-free lysates from E. coli BL21(λD3) harboring pET28a-wabHR110, pET28a-wabP50/57, pET28a-wabNR110, and pET28a-wabN50/57 were prepared as above using a phosphate-saline buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl). His6-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) using 1-ml HiTrap chelating HP columns (Amersham Biosciences) previously loaded with nickel sulfate and equilibrated with the phosphate-saline buffer. The columns were washed with phosphate-saline buffer containing 5 mm imidazole (10 column volumes), and the His-tagged proteins were eluted by a continuous gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole in phosphate-saline buffer. The buffer in the eluted proteins was exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the proteins were concentrated. The transferase activity of His6-WabHR110 and His6-WabP50/57 were determined essentially as described (27Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were performed in a total 0.1-ml volume at a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc was used as donor, and 0.001 mg of LPS from strain 52145ΔwabH was used as acceptor. The reactions were started by the addition of 0.02 mg of either His6-WabHR110 or His6-WabP50/57. After 2 h at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. The reaction products were separated in Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Identical reactions using 0.25 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc or UDP-[14C]GalNAc (NEN Life Science; with specific activities of 51.2 and 55.5 mCi/mmol, respectively) were performed. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed by minigel filtration in 3 ml of Sephadex G-100, and the pooled and concentrated LPS fractions were separated as above by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was autoradiographed to visualize the incorporation of GlcNAc and GalNAc. For quantitative analysis, the reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (27Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The LPS was recovered by filtration (0.45 μm) and washed, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into LPS was measured in a scintillation counter. Quantitative experiments using different concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc (1–800 μm) and acceptor LPS (1–800 μm) were performed. These reactions were stopped at different times (expressed in minutes), and the data from three independent experiments were used to determine the apparent Km for acceptor LPS and enzyme substrate. The ability of His6-WabNR110 and His6-WabN50/57 to catalyze the deacetylation of GlcNAc or GalNAc residue in LPS was assayed by using LPS from mutant 52145ΔwabH in reactions containing 0.4 mg each of His6-WabH and His6-WabN or His6-WabP and His6-WabN. Assay reactions using UDP-[14C]GlcNAc or UDP-[14C]GalNAc were carried out in a total of 0.1 ml at a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03 mg of 52145ΔwabH acceptor LPS, and 0.02 mg of each histidine-tagged protein. The reactions were started by the addition of 0.25 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlaNAc or UDP-[14C]GalNAc. Assays were performed at 37 °C for 2 h and were stopped by adding 2 volumes of 0.375 m MgCl2 in 95% ethanol and cooling at −20 °C for 2 h. The LPS was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min and suspended in 100 μl of water. The LPS was precipitated with 2 volumes of 0.375 m MgCl2 in 95% ethanol; this step was repeated three times to eliminate the unincorporated UDP-[14C]GlcNAc or UDP-[14C]GalNAc. The LPS was hydrolyzed by resuspension in 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl and heating to 100 °C for 48 h. The labeled residues from the hydrolyzed LPS samples were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Kieselgel 60; Merck) with n-butanol, methanol, 25% ammonia solution, water (5:4:2:1, v/v/v/v). The labeled residues were detected by autoradiography, using as standards [14C]GlcNAc, [14C]GalNAc, [14C]GlcN, and [14C]GalN. Similarly to the majority of Enterobacteriaceae in the P. mirabilis strains R110 and 51/57 a gene cluster (wa) was identified containing most of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the core OS (16Aquilini E. Azevedo J. Jimenez N. Bouamama L. Tomás J.M. Regué M. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The overall structure of these gene clusters was similar to the one found in strain HI4320 for which the whole genome sequence is available (28Pearson M.M. Sebaihia M. Churcher C. Quail M.A. Seshasayee A.S. Luscombe N.M. Abdellah Z. Arrosmith C. Atkin B. Chillingworth T. Hauser H. Jagels K. Moule S. Mungall K. Norbertczak H. Rabbinowitsch E. Walker D. Whithead S. Thomson N.R. Rather P.N. Parkhill J. Mobley H.L.T. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4027-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because strains R110 and 51/57 contain GlcN in the outer core LPS, we determined the organization of this cluster for strains 50/57 and TG83 containing GalN instead of GlcN (Fig. 1). Oligonucleotide pairs previously used in the amplification of DNA fragments of the cluster in strains R110 and 51/57 were used to amplify fragments from genomic DNA of strains 50/57 and TG83 and to determine its nucleotide sequence. Some of these oligonucleotide pairs did work, whereas others did not when using genomic DNA from strains 50/57 and TG83, suggesting that there are conserved and unconserved regions in the wa cluster among these four P. mirabilis strains. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragments was used to design further primers, allowing the amplification of DNA fragments encompassing the already sequenced ones. This strategy allowed the determination of the full nucleotide sequence of the wa gene cluster from P. mirabilis strains 50/57 and TG83 (19,155 bp). These two clusters showed more than 95% identity. The comparative analysis of these sequences revealed that in all four strains the 5′-end of the cluster contains the hldD (ADP-d-glycero-d-manno-heptose epimerase), waaF (ADP-l-glycero-α-d-manno-heptosepyranose transferase II), and waaC (ADP-l-glycero-α-d-manno-heptosepyranose transferase I) genes. The 3′-end of the cluster contains the waaA (CMP-Kdo:lipidA Kdo bifunctional transferase and waaE (glucosyltransferase) genes adjacent to core OS-unrelated genes coaD (phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase) (29Geerlof A.

In the middle of the cluster, genes waaQ (ADP-l-glycero-α-d-manno-heptosepyranose transferase III), wamA (ADP-d-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose transferase), wabG (UDP-GalA transferase), wabH-like (UDP-GlcNAc transferase), and wabN (LPS-GlcNAc deacetylase) were identified (Fig. 1). The wa clusters of these two P. mirabilis strains shared additional characteristic features with those of previously studied ones (16Aquilini E. Azevedo J. Jimenez N. Bouamama L. Tomás J.M. Regué M.

The main difference between the 50/57 and TG83 wa clusters and those of R110, 51/57, and HI4320 is the inversion of the three-gene waaQ-wabH region (Fig. 1), explaining why some oligonucleotide pairs derived from strain R110 sequence failed in PCR amplification experiments using genomic DNA from either 50/57 or TG83 strains. Comparison of the wa cluster with the known core OS structures for these four strains (Fig. 1) shows that additional genes located outside of the cluster should be necessary to complete the biosynthesis of this structure. Only one of these genes has been identified (wabO) (16Aquilini E. Azevedo J. Jimenez N. Bouamama L. Tomás J.M. Regué M. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For strains 50/57 and TG83, it can be postulated that four and three additional genes should be located outside of the wa cluster, respectively. Gene-deduced amino acid alignment among homologue proteins shared by the five P. mirabilis strains studied so far showed amino acid identities and similarities over 95 and 98%, respectively. The only exception was for WabH and WabH-like proteins, where two groups were found, WabH-like50/57-WabH-likeTG83 and WabHR110-WabH51/57, with 100 and 99% identities, respectively. Both groups shared 60 and 89% levels of identity and similarity. An alignment between these"

The presence of agonist, and particularly LY-165,163, appears to widen the phase transitions, an effect that is much more pronounced in the presence of cholesterol. It was found that both agonists locate close to the cholesterol, and their interactions with the lipids are modulated by the lipid phases. As the membrane condenses into mixed liquid-ordered/disordered phases, quipazine is pushed up toward the surface of the bilayer, whereas LY-165,163 moves deeper into the lipid chain region. In light of our results, we discuss the role of lipid/drug interactions on drug efficacy.

In light of our results, we discuss the role of lipid/drug interactions on drug efficacy. The majority of drug targets are membrane proteins. Hence the interaction of a drug with the membrane is crucial for its efficacy. A high location probability in a particular part of a membrane and its orientation with respect to the membrane normal could well be relevant to how the drug is presented to the target protein's binding site (1.Vauquelin G. Packeu A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 311: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2.Castanho M.A. Fernandes M.X. Eur. Biophys. J. 2006; 35: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cholesterol-rich microdomains (“lipid rafts”) add another layer of complexity because the lateral organization of the membrane could well affect the concentration of a drug close to its target protein. This possibility is backed up by the observation that many chemicals, including drugs that target serotonin receptors, preferentially localize into these domains (3.Eisensamer B. Uhr M. Meyr S.

Sci. 2009; 38: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the location and activity of some membrane proteins, particularly G-protein-coupled receptors, seem to be affected by domains (6.Björk K. Sjögren B. Svenningsson P. Exp. Cell Res. 2010; 316: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is easy to imagine that a drug's efficacy may be limited by it partitioning into a different membrane domain than its target receptor. Furthermore, it is clear that many membrane proteins are modulated by the properties of the surrounding lipids. Hence, a drug has the potential to regulate a protein by altering these properties (7.Escribá P.V. González-Ros J.M. Goñi F.M. Kinnunen P.K. Vigh L. Sánchez-Magraner L. Fernández A.M. Busquets X. Horváth I. Barceló-Coblijn G. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 829-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing possibility of a class of drugs that, instead of directly targeting a protein, target the membrane in which the protein resides. This route of action was first proposed as early as 1899 as a possible mechanism for general anesthetics, when it was noted that the potency of an anesthetic correlated very strongly with olive oil/water partitioning (8.Meyer H.H. Arch. Exp. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1899; 42: 109-118Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar), yet drugs affecting membrane proteins via lipid interactions, so called “membrane-lipid therapy,” have only relatively recently been explored (7.Escribá P.V.

J. 2005; 89: 2504-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) interpreted the phase behavior as follows. At high temperatures (above 316 K), the whole bilayer is in the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase, characterized by rapid axial rotation and highly disordered aliphatic chains (16.Polozov I.V. Gawrisch K. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2051-2061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Between 311 and 316 K, a mixed phase of liquid-ordered (Lo) and Ld phase lipids exists. Below 311 K, the membrane starts to coalesce into a mixture of Lo and gel phase (where the rotation of the lipids slows dramatically) before finally forming a homogenous gel phase. It is the Lo domains that are thought to resemble cholesterol-rich microdomains found in biological membranes. 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liquid-ordered liquid-disordered magic angle spinning dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine individual bond C–2H order parameter first spectral moment. Proton NMR and specifically magic angle spinning-assisted nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (MAS-NOESY) experiments have proven to be an excellent tool for investigating, with atomic resolution, the location of small molecules embedded in lipid membranes (17.Lopez J.J. Lorch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7813-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18.Siarheyeva A. Lopez J.J. Glaubitz C.

However, these studies have been limited to binary mixtures because anything more complicated results in serious spectral overlap. To circumvent this problem, we have used ternary mixtures of agonists, cholesterol, and chain deuterated DPPC lipids (DPPC-d62), thus removing the signals that would otherwise swamp the cholesterol resonances. The system allows interactions between cholesterol and agonist to be observed. Furthermore, the rapid axial motion of the lipids in the Lo and Ld phases allows high resolution 1H spectra to be collected in both of these phases (14.Scheidt H.A. Huster D. Gawrisch K. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2504-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The work presented here follows from a study in which it was noticed that several of the agonists induced significant chemical shifts in the cholesterol signals of a brain lipid extract (17.Lopez J.J. Lorch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7813-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the interactions between bilayers containing cholesterol and the agonists, we now present a solid state NMR-based approach that utilizes DPPC-d62 to reveal NOESY interactions within the Lo and Ld phases, shedding light on how cholesterol and bilayer phases influence the interactions between bilayer components. Finally we have also analyzed the effect that agonist have on the phase behavior of the lipid bilayers, and we comment on how this may provide an alternative route of action for drugs. We concentrate on quipazine and LY-165,163 (Fig. 1) because they previously showed strong interactions with cholesterol (17.Lopez J.J. Lorch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7813-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). DPPC, DPPC-d62, and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti polar lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other chemicals, including quipazine as a maleate salt and LY-165,163, were purchased from Sigma. Samples of DPPC/cholesterol, DPPC/agonist, and DPPC/cholesterol/agonist were prepared at mole ratios of 8:2, 9:1, and 7:2:1, respectively. Typically, 80 mg of DPPC was used per sample. The lipids and agonists were co-dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The solvents were evaporated under vacuum, and the resulting lipid cake was suspended in 1 ml of doubly distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then lyophilized overnight under high vacuum. The dry lipid mixtures were hydrated with ∼200 μl of D2O for proton NMR or H2O for deuterium NMR experiments and then subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. The mixtures were centrifuged to remove excess water. 4-mm MAS rotors were filled with the resulting pellets. Samples were kept in the rotors for both 1H and 2H measurements. All NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance II 500-MHz spectrometer using a 4-mm MAS probe operating at a frequency of 500.1013 MHz (1H) and a wide line probe at 76.7685 MHz (2H). 1H experiments were carried out with an MAS speed of 10 kHz. 2H measurements were conducted without sample spinning. 1H spectra were externally referenced to tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm. 1H experiments were conducted with a typical π/2 pulse length of 7 μs and a relaxation delay of 4 s. Two-dimensional NOESY experiments had 256 or 512 increments and up to 64 scans/increment. NOESY build-up curves were acquired using mixing times between 10 and 800 ms. Samples were heated to 333 K before cooling to 273 K and then heating to the desired measuring temperature. Experiments were conducted at 298, 308, and 316 K (according to the thermocouple in the probe head). MAS at 10 kHz was found to heat the sample by 2 K (derived from the relative positions of methanol peaks (21.Amman C. Meier P. Merbach A.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 46: 319-321Google Scholar)). All subsequent references to the sample temperature will take this into account. 2H quadrupole echo experiments (22.Davis J.H. Jeffrey K.R. Bloom M. Valic M.I. Higgs T.P. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1976; 42: 390-394Crossref Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 23.Davis J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 117-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) were acquired with a spectral width of 100 kHz, a recycle delay of 1 s, 30-μs echo delay, 10-ms acquisition time, π/2 pulses of 5.5 μs, and between 2048 and 4096 scans. All samples were heated to 333 K before cooling down to 273 K prior to temperature scans. Measurements were then taken at 1 K intervals between 273 and 333 K (according to the thermocouple in the probe head). NMR data were processed using Topspin version 1.3 (Bruker Instruments, Karlsruhe, Germany). NOESY peak volumes were obtained by peak fitting and integration using CARA (24.Keller R.L.J. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. Cantina Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). NOESY data were used to calculate the location of a given nucleus in the lipid membrane using the “full matrix rate analysis,” described in detail by Huster et al. (25.Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 243-251Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In short, experimentally measured NOESY peak volumes, represented by the matrix A, at the mixing time tm, and the cross relaxation rates R are linked by the matrix equation as follows.A(tm)=A(0)⋅exp⁡(−Rtm)(Eq. 1) The relaxation rate matrix R is calculated by rewriting Equation 1 as follows.R=X(ln⁡D)X−1tm Here, X is the matrix of eigenvectors, and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of the normalized peak volume matrix a(tm) = A(tm)((A(0)−1). The relaxation rates, contained in R, were taken as indicators of the relative location probabilities and are plotted to give a location profile of the agonists. All calculations were carried out with the help of Python (Python Software Foundation, Wolfeboro Falls, NH), specifically with the packages matplotlib (available from the sourceforge Web site) and scipy (26.Jones, E., Oliphant, T., Peterson, P., (2001) SciPy: Open Source Scientific Tools for Python, SciPy, www.scipy.orgGoogle Scholar). 2H spectra were de-Paked, and first spectral moments were calculated using NMR-Depaker software (available from the Launchpad Web site). The de-Paking procedure was performed according to the fast Fourier transform-based fast deconvolution algorithm (27.McCabe M.A. Wassall S.R. Solid State Nucl. Magn. Reson. 1997; 10: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Individual C–2H bond order parameters (SCDi) were calculated from quadrupolar splittings (νqi), as described previously (23.Davis J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 117-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 28.Salmon A. Dodd S.W. Williams G.D. Beach J.M. Brown M.F. J. Am. Chem.

Muller B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1971; 55: 5829Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). SCDi profiles for the sn-1 chain of DPPC-d62 were constructed according to the published assignments (28.Salmon A.

J. 1979; 27: 339-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and comparisons with specifically labeled phospholipids (31.Seelig A. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4839-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 32.Oldfield E. Meadows M. Rice D. Jacobs R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2727-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). First moment (M1) calculation was performed using a sign reversal for negative frequencies to avoid zero values due to 2H NMR spectrum symmetrical relative to the origin,M1=∫−∞0−ωS(ω)dω+∫0∞ωS(ω)dω∫−∞0ωS(ω)dω where ω = 0 is the center of the spectrum. The low agonist/lipid ratio (1:10 mole ratio) used in this study is desirable to minimize the effect of the agonist on the phase behavior of the lipids. Proton MAS spectra of DPPC and DPPC-d62/cholesterol lipid membranes in the presence and absence of 5HT1a receptor agonists are shown in Fig. 2. Spectra were collected with 10-kHz sample spinning. At this speed, lipid mixtures in the gel phase yield extremely broad lines, which render individual resonance unresolvable (Fig. 2A, right). However, lipids in the Lo or Ld phases exhibit rapid axial rotations. This motion combined with that of the MAS results in well resolved proton spectra. All NOESY measurements, described below, take place at a temperature where spectra are well resolved and hence most of the gel phase has melted. Assignments of the agonist signals were performed previously (17.Lopez J.J. Lorch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7813-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, for the sake of simplicity, only two peaks for each will be used for the analysis. Assignments for DPPC have been determined elsewhere (14.Scheidt H.A. Huster D. Gawrisch K. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2504-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Proton cholesterol assignments are derived from published MAS 13C measurements of cholesterol/DMPC mixtures (33.Soubias O. Jolibois F. Reat V. Milon A. Chem. Eur. J. 2004; 10: 6005-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and confirmed with DPPC/cholesterol using 13C-1H correlation experiments (data not shown). In DPPC/agonist mixtures, above the gel-Ld phase transition at 310 K, most DPPC proton resonances are resolved (Fig. 2A). The addition of cholesterol to the DPPC results in loss of resolution in the aliphatic region (below 2.5 ppm) as the cholesterol signals overlap with those from the chains of DPPC. Replacing protonated DPPC with DPPC-d62 resolves this issue by removing 99% of the proton signals from the DPPC chains, thus revealing cholesterol chain signals (Fig. 2B). Many of the cholesterol signals overlap with one another, meaning that it is not always possible to unambiguously assign a cholesterol peak to a particular part of the molecule. However, broadly speaking, it is possible to group the peaks into structural categories. The terminal CH3 groups (C26/27c) are clearly resolved from the CH3 groups protruding up from the plane of the sterol rings (C18c, C19c, and C21c), whereas the protons on the sterol rings give another set of peaks. 1H NMR signals of the agonists' aromatic moieties (Fig. 2, C and D) are well resolved and downfield of the lipid resonances (>6 ppm). Aliphatic agonist signals overlap with the stronger lipid signals, with the exception of the CH2 protons in the piperazine ring of quipazine (resonance 1, Fig. 2D) and aliphatic CH2 protons of LY-165,163 at 3.4 and 2.7 ppm (resonance 1, Fig. 2C). Phase diagrams of binary mixtures of DPPC and cholesterol are well documented. However, the phase behavior of the DPPC/cholesterol/agonist mixtures are unknown. To gain some insight into the properties of these mixtures, 2H NMR measurements were performed at 1 K intervals between 273 and 333 K on DPPC-d62 with and without cholesterol and agonists (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the first spectral moment (M1) for the 2H spectra of DPPC-d62 plus agonist (without cholesterol). M1 is proportional to the average quadrupolar splitting and thus gives a measure of the width of all spectral components (29.Davis J.H. Biophys. J. 1979; 27: 339-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The spectra of pure DPPC-d62 show a small decrease in the M1 at 301 K as the lipid enters a ripple phase (34.Karmakar S. Raghunathan V.A. Mayor S. J. Phys. Cond. Matter. 2005; 17: S1177-S1182Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This is followed by a sudden decrease between 309 and 310 K as the lipid goes through the gel to Ld transition. The addition of agonists to the system appears to abolish the spectral changes characteristic of the gel to ripple phase transition. Furthermore, in the presence of agonist and prior to chain melting, M1 is significantly lower than for DPPC-d62 alone. The transition from the gel to Ld phase is also slightly lowered and broadened, now occurring between 304 and 307 K for DPPC-d62/quipazine and between 304 and 309 K for DPPC-d62/LY-165,163.FIGURE 4M1 on the left-hand axis of the 2H spectra versus temperature for DPPC-d62 (circles), DPPC-d62/quipazine (squares), and DPPC-d62/LY-165,163 (open triangles).

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). There is no sudden phase transition; instead, there is a shallow decrease in line widths and first spectral moments indicative of gradual transitions between gel, Lo, and Ld phases, all of which may co-exist (Fig. 5). The presence of agonists lowers the transition temperatures but not the overall trend. However, at low temperature, the samples containing agonist and cholesterol displayed unusual behavior (Fig. 5). Between 278 and 293 K, the first spectral moments increased before peaking prior to the onset of gel phase melting. Closer inspection of the 2H spectra of DPPC-d62 reveals that at some temperatures two sets of peaks arise from the terminal methyl groups; this can be clearly seen in the insets of Fig. 3. This splitting is the result of the non-equivalency of the two lipid chains (11.Vist M.R. Davis J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and can be used as a reporter for the presence of Lo phase (11.Vist M.R. Davis J.H.

Methyl peak splittings are observed between 293 and 317 K for DPPC-d62/cholesterol and over a similar temperature range, just shifted down by a few K (between 287 and 313 K) for DPPC-d62/cholesterol/quipazine. In the case of DPPC-d62/cholesterol/LY-165,163, methyl group splittings were observed over a much larger range, between 280 and 327 K. Interestingly, methyl peak splitting is also seen at 306 K in the DPPC-d62/LY-165,163 sample (supplemental Fig. 1d). The magnitudes of these splittings are shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5. 2H spectra can also be used to report on the gel phase where it is manifested as large quadrupole splittings and poorly resolved signals. Using these criteria, it is possible to define the upper limit of the gel phase as being 310 K (in agreement with the literature (11.Vist M.R. Davis J.H.

The non-equivalency of the two lipid chains leads to a separate profile for each chain (29.Davis J.H. Biophys. J. 1979; 27: 339-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, for the sake of clarity, only data from the sn-1 chain are shown. It is immediately noticeable that the SCDi value of bilayers containing cholesterol is, as expected, appreciably higher than those without. The addition of agonists has more subtle effects; there is no appreciable difference between the SCDi values of pure DPPC-d62 and DPPC-d62 containing agonists. Nor does the addition of quipazine to the cholesterol-containing bilayers have any affect. However, in the presence of cholesterol, LY-165,163 causes an increase in order parameter throughout the whole of the chain. MAS-NOESY of DPPC/agonist mixtures was performed above the main phase transition at 310 K using 10-, 100-, 200-, and 400-ms mixing times. NOESY measurements on DPPC-d62/cholesterol/agonist were conducted at the lowest temperature at which individual resonances could still be resolved (300 K) with mixing times of 10, 200, 300, and 400 ms. The experiments were repeated at 318 K with mixing times increased to 20, 400, 500, and 600 ms to take into account the decrease in correlation times at the higher temperatures (37.Holte L.L. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4669-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At 318 K, DPPC-d62/cholesterol/quipazine is in a pure Ld phase, but DPPC-d62/cholesterol/LY-165,163 still has traces of Lo phase (Fig. 5). However, increasing the temperature further resulted in correlation times being too short to practically measure cross-peak intensities (data not shown). A typical MAS-NOESY spectrum of LY-165,163/DPPC-d62 and cholesterol membranes is depicted in Fig. 7. Cross-peaks are visible between all aromatic LY-165,163, glycerol and headgroup DPPC, and cholesterol resonances. The build-up rates of the cross-peaks with increased mixing times give an indication of the proximity of two protons. Consequently, the location probability of a particular agonist proton in the lipid membrane can be determined relative to other lipid protons (Fig. 8). If multiple agonist proton signals are resolved (see Fig. 2), the orientation of the molecule relative to other components in the bilayer can also be determined.FIGURE 8Cross-relaxation rates between DPPC or cholesterol and agonists derived from MAS-NOESY measurements at the temperatures indicated.

Lorch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7813-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); the aromatic ring at one end of the quipazine molecule has a maximum location probability in the chain region of the bilayer, whereas the other end locates in the interface region, indicating that it has a net orientation parallel to the lipids. In the case of LY-165,163, the maximum location probability is the same as reported previously in DOPC, but in DPPC, it is much more tightly distributed around the chain/glycerol regions. It should be noted at this point that the reported quipazine resonances are the same as we used previously (17.Lopez J.J. Lorch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7813-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, here, different LY-165,163 peaks are used because they can be more clearly resolved at 300 K. One of these peaks is derived from protons situated in the center of the molecule, whereas the other is at one end of the LY-165,163 molecules (Fig. 1); thus, some spatial resolution has been lost. The NOESY measurements on DPPC-d62/cholesterol/agonist samples give information on the interactions between agonist and cholesterol at the expense of information on interactions between the chain region of DPPC and the agonist. At 318 K (Fig. 8, E and F), both agonists have weak interactions with the terminal methyl groups of the cholesterol chain, consistent with the previous observations that the agonists do not accumulate deep within the chain region of the bilayer. Beyond this similarity, the agonists behave quite differently. Quipazine shows large cross relaxation rates with all of the remaining cholesterol resonances. The aromatic ring of quipazine interacts more strongly with the C18c than the piperazine ring at the other end of the molecule, whereas the piperazine ring has stronger interactions with the phospholipid headgroup. Interestingly, the presence of cholesterol also seems to change the interactions between quipazine and the phospholipid. Cross-relaxation rates between quipazine and DPPC α resonance are larger in the ternary DPPC-d62/cholesterol sample than in the binary DPPC sample. In the case of LY-165,163, the center of the molecule has strong cross-peaks with C9/19/21c but little contact with anything else. Meanwhile, the aromatic at the end of the molecule has significant interactions with all reported cholesterol peaks with the exception of the C14/17/24c peak. Furthermore, the presence of cholesterol appears to increase the interactions between LY-165,163 and the phospholipid headgroup. The second set of NOESYs were conducted at 300 K (Fig. 8, C and D). Under these conditions the orientational bias of quipazine is even more apparent. As before the aromatic ring interacts more strongly with C18c but now, unlike in the binary DPPC or DOPC mixtures, the pipera"
https://openalex.org/W2084582792,"Hybrid Phoxinus are one of the few asexually reproducing vertebrates species. The distribution of hybrid Phoxinus among lakes in Algonquin Park, Ontario, was evaluated relative to the distribution of parental species and relative to physiochemical lake characteristics. No association between the distribution of hybrids and the distribution of parental species was found, suggesting that the hybrids can successfully coexist with either parental species. In addition, we found no association between hybrid distribution and the physiochemical characteristics of lakes, suggesting that the hybrids are generalists with respect to the ecological niches available in Algonquin Park. There was a difference between the physiochemical characteristics of lakes with and without the parental species P. neogaeus. The lakes containing P. neogaeus were lower elevation than the lakes containing the other parental species, P. eos. The difference in distribution between the parental species may therefore be due to different dispersal abilities, to later arrival following post-glacial dispersal, or to differences in ecology. These results suggest that asexual reproduction is a successful strategy for hybrid Phoxinus in Algonquin Park because these sperm-dependent asexual hybrids are able to survive and persist regardless of which parental species is present, and regardless of the physiochemical characteristics of their habitat."
