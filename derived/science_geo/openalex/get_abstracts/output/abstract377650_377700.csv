https://openalex.org/W2032471754,"Mottram1 demonstrated that the effect of gamma- and X-radiations in inhibiting the growth of Vicia faba root tips was materially reduced if the exposure was made under anaerobic conditions, and that the change in radiosensitivity could not be correlated with a change in the proportion of cells in division at the time of irradiation. Crabtree and Cramer2 had previously shown a similar effect of anaerobiosis on the radiosensitivity of tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968501150,"When Penicillium janczewskii is grown in liquid culture media a substance is produced which causes stunting, excessive branching and characteristic distortions in the germ tubes of Botrytis allii and other fungi1. The substance has been isolated and called ‘curling-factor’2. When some preliminary observations3 were made on the chemical and physical properties of curling-factor, the presence of chlorine was overlooked and a formula C20H20O9 was proposed. We find that chlorine is present and that curling-factor is identical with griseofulvin C17H17O6Cl, which was isolated several years ago by Oxford, Raistrick and Simonart4 from Penicillium griseofulvum (for curling-factor found: C 58·4; H 4·9 per cent; mol. wt. 362; OCH3 23·2; Cl 9·8 (micro) and 9·7 (macro) per cent; CH3—(C) 4·9 per cent; calculated for C17H17O6Cl: C 57·9; H 4·9 per cent; mol. wt. 352·7; OCH3 26·4 (for three OCH3); Cl 10·1; CH3—(C) 4·3 (for one CH3) per cent). The melting point (220°) of a sample of griseofulvin which was kindly supplied to us by Prof. Raistrick was not depressed by mixing with curling-factor (m.p. also 220°); and further, griseofulvin is identical with curling-factor in its biological properties5."

We have found little evidence, however, that this phenomenon has been used to any great extent as a laboratory technique to simplify the bulk preparation of materials of a colloidal character."

https://openalex.org/W1973946943,"In a previous communication1 it was shown that β-glucuronidase in liver or kidney rises following administration of toxic agents to mice, depending upon the organ or organs affected. It was suggested that a rise in this enzyme is associated with tissue repair rather than the damage itself. This view is confirmed by results for kidney following administration of mercuric nitrate or chloroform to male mice. In each case, the rise in the enzyme did not occur in the early stages of poisoning, but was seen when repair was well advanced."

https://openalex.org/W2036516283,"During the past ten years, a series of investigations on the generation of high-frequency oscillations in thermionic tubes containing gas at low pressure has been made in this laboratory. The vacuum electromagnetic wave-lengths involved, usually well below 100 cm., and the conditions under which they appear, are in the main consistent with the view that they are plasma-electron oscillations with frequency approximately equal to 104n1/2 (n is electron concentration), originating near the cathode1,2. The shortest wave-length which can be obtained is, however, not about 15 cm., as indicated by previous publications, but 5 cm. or less. Whatever its exact value, this is likely to be determined by the damping of the oscillatory motion of the electrons by collisions with ions when the ionization is very dense, or by collisions between electrons and gas-molecules at the gas-pressures necessary to produce high electron concentrations readily."

https://openalex.org/W2003574057,"The continuation of the work with the purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria, previously reported1–4, has confirmed the tetrasomic inheritance of the factor for mid-style. Lacour's determination of the somatic chromosome number as sixty suggests, therefore, the existence of fifteen quadruplets of homologous chromosomes. Since the short style is epistatic to mid, it is possible by legitimate crosses between short- and mid-styled plants to build up genetic constitutions up to four genes for the mid-style; all these appear to be phenotypically alike, or, in other words, the mid-style gene appears to be completely dominant."
https://openalex.org/W52953807,"IN connexion with the discovery of the transuranic element 93Np239, McMillan and Abelson1 report h 0·47 MeV. as the upper energy limit of the β-spectrum. The γ-radiation was found to be complex and the energy less than 0·3 MeV. Philipp, Riedhammer and Wiedemann23 studied the β-spectrum of Np239 photo-graphically by means of the semicircular method. They found ten internal conversion lines. Eight of them were interpreted as the K-, L- and.M-lines of three nuclear γ-radiations of the energies 208, 226 and 276 keV., two lines as the L- and M-lines of a Kα-radiation. The results are reproduced in the accompanying table. Later, Philipp and Riedhammer4 reported that the β-spectrum is a single one and that the β-decay is connected also with a 500 keV. γ-radiation. Recently, Feather and Krishnan5 investigated the radiation from U239 by absorption measurements. They found, in the main, a single β-spectrum and give the value 1·20 MeV. for the upper energy limit. A γ-radiation of 76 keV. energy and another of at least 300 keV. were also observed."

https://openalex.org/W1999116884,"In previous work it was shown that the thiocyanate anion (0·05 mol. solution of sodium thiocyanate), which produces monsters with large notochord and hyper-evocation in Amphibia embryos1, also induces a decrease in viscosity of solutions containing euglobulin b2. On the other hand, lithium chloride induces an increase in viscosity of these solutions, at a concentration (0·14 mol.) which produces monsters with reduced notochord and hypo-evocation. A similar effect has been found for the viscosity of solutions containing fibrillar particles (myosin, sodium thymo-nucleinate)3. In order to find what kinds of modifications were induced by the various salts in the myosin solutions, an investigation with the electron microscope was undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W2070878461,"It has been known for some time that a fall of temperature can reverse the motor end-plate blocking action of curare1. There seems to be two possible explanations of this strange phenomenon. The simplest hypothesis is to regard the reaction between curare and the receptor as a reversible dissociation which increases with decreasing temperature, a most unusual assumption. Alternatively, we might assume that the curare was being antagonized by some naturally occurring substance (cf. Ing and Wright2 in this connexion), and that as the temperature was lowered the competition went against the curare. Since Wilson and Wright3 have shown that potassium antagonizes curare, we investigated this competition quantitatively in order to determine the influence of temperature on the antagonism between added curare and the naturally occurring potassium ions."
https://openalex.org/W2053315722,"In view of the rather surprising distortions reported in the dimensions of the para-dinitrobenzene molecule1, a redetermination of this structure was recently attempted in this laboratory. The results of our preliminary two-dimensional survey did not point to a completely symmetrical molecule, but indicated that either (a) the planes of the nitro-groups may be slightly inclined (about 5°) to the plane of the benzene ring, or (b) the nitrogen – oxygen distances within the nitro-groups may not be equal, but differ by about 0·05 A. We were unable to distinguish between these alternatives by two-dimensional X-ray methods. In the meantime, we have learned that a full three-dimensional analysis of this structure has been undertaken elsewhere, so we have not pursued the matter further. The final results will be awaited with interest."
https://openalex.org/W2415712287,"THE lecture on “The Organisation of Industrial Research” which Dr. R. P. Russell, president of the Standard Oil Development Co., delivered on June 9 to the Industrial Research Committee of the Federation of British Industries was far more than a factual review of one of the world's largest research organisations or its achievements in the petroleum industry: it was a masterly analysis of factors and conditions determining the success of industrial research in any field and an outstanding contribution to what may be termed the philosophy of research. Research activity in his own Company, he said, began in 1919 with a group of twenty-six people: to-day the staff includes 2,456 technologists, engineers, assistants and clerical personnel all engaged exclusively on research and development projects, as well as several hundred working on laboratory phases of direct operating problems and an engineering staff of more than five hundred. Dr. Russell computed that this expansion had brought a return of £15,400 of additional profit for each £1,000 expended on research and development, and he believes that without research and development any company or industry would stagnate and in time lose most of its business to more far-sighted competitors."

https://openalex.org/W1990458598,"The rapid immobilization of mammalian spermatozoa which occurs when an ejaculate is diluted with a large volume of physiological saline is the basis of Milovanov's1 test of ‘resistance’, used in assessing the value of a specimen for artificial insemination. Milovanov attributes this immobilization to the toxic action of chloride ions. Chang2 also remarks on the low motility, rate of respiration and fertilizing capacity of rabbit spermatozoa in dilute suspension. Our own observations confirm these findings; rabbit spermatozoa at a concentration of 20 million/ml. in Baker's3 solution remain motile for two or three days at room temperature, whereas at a concentration of 0·4 million/ml. they are motionless within an hour or two. In our experience this rapid loss of motility is not attributable to a toxic action of chlorides, since chloride-free diluents have an identical action."
https://openalex.org/W1990769591,"In a previous communication1 some successful feeding experiments with the adults of Trombicula acuscutellaris Walch on the eggs, ovaries and adults of Mansonia (Mansonioides) uniformis (Theobald) (Tœniorhynchus (M.) uniformis) were described. Since then, further proof of the carnivorous habits of this species has been obtained and adults have been fed on freshly killed Collembola and psocids. They are unable, however, to trap living Collembola or psocids, and it is unlikely that in Nature such active insects would be utilized as food. But for the routine feeding of nymphs and adults in the laboratory, it has been found more convenient to use culicine eggs, and for this purpose the eggs of Culex fatigans Wied. have been very largely used. These eggs are eaten with great avidity, and an ovipositing adult is capable of eating fifty or more eggs in 24 hours. By way of contrast, it may be mentioned that an adult of T. deliensis Walch, which is less than half the size of T. acuscutellaris, rarely eats more than two to four eggs in 24 hours and has never been known to exceed a maximum of nine eggs in that time."

https://openalex.org/W2028684832,"Many different views have been expressed concerning the chemical steps by which certain species of Aspergillus and of Penicillium convert glucose into citric acid. Some of the earlier hypotheses are now only of historical interest, and those modern views for which a reasonable amount of experimental support can be adduced have one feature in common, namely, the presumption that acetic acid is an essential intermediate. Up to the present time, however, the occurrence of this acid in cultures of A. niger on sugar does not appear to have been demonstrated. We have made many attempts to detect its presence in the metabolism solution, but without success, an outcome not entirely unexpected in view of the ease with which A. niger metabolizes acetic acid in the presence of sugar (compare Pfeffer1)."

Spielman failed to obtain the 3-ethyl analogue by this method using diethyl sulphate. A product, m.p. 61–62°, which was regarded as the 3-ethyl analogue, was, however, obtained by the action of ethyl iodide on the silver salt of 5:5-dimethyloxazolidine-2: 4-dione."

The relatively recent nature of this work, most of which was undertaken as a direct consequence of the clinical success of penicillin, has obscured to a great extent the fact that work on antibiotics had been carried on since the middle of the nineteenth century, in the fields both of medical microbiology and of plant pathology. The organisers of the symposium on “Penicillin and other Antibiotics” at the British Association meeting at Dundee, by bringing together Sections B (Chemistry), I (Physiology) and K (Botany), sought to arrange their programme so that these various aspects were touched upon."

https://openalex.org/W2059649935,"MOST organic chemists have found in literature searches that the tracing of entries relating to particular compounds may be difficult because of inconsistencies in indexing practice. For example, although in the introduction to the Collective Index 1923–32 to British Chemical Abstracts there is given a list of substituents such as amino-, chloro-, nitro-, etc., which in the Index are placed immediately after the remainder of the name, whether or not the substituent group is preceded by di-, tri-, etc., and although the name of the individual compound commences with that substituent, previous practice had, varied. In earlier volumes “Nitrotoluene”, for example, may be found under “Toluene, nitro-”, “Nitrotoluene” or “Paranitrotoluene”, with or without appropriate cross-references. Again, in one volume, “Nitrochloronaphthalene” appears as well as “Naphthalene-, nitrochloro”, but “Tetranitro-, naphthol, α-”, is given only under “T”, whereas “Trichloroacetic acid” appears under “Acetic acid, trichlor-”. Disregarding variations in spelling, “para-nitroaniline” is indexed under “P” (Paranitroaniline), under “A” (Aniline, p-nitro-) and under “N” (Nitro- aniline, p-), and the nitrotoluidines under “Amino -toluene, nitro”, under “Nitro-toluidines”, under “Toluene, nitroamino” and under “Toluidines, -nitro”."

https://openalex.org/W4231563749,"THE discussion on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation which took place at the British Association meeting at Dundee attracted a very small audience; no doubt this was due in part to the fact that the meeting clashed with other important and topical discussions; but a more important reason is the general lack of knowledge of the activities of the Organisation. Sir John Maud, it is true, headed members of the British co-operating body, and expounded most ably the aims of the Organisation; he believes it should attempt to instruct the peoples of the world on the realities of the situation, so that they can understand, better the causes of peace and war and thus make the politicians' task of direction easier. He sees its task as primarily that of helping people to learn that they need one another, and to deepen their sense of social responsibility, thus pursuing much the line of thought in more general terms that Mr. Henry Stimson follows in his article in Foreign Affairs on “The Challenge to Americans”. Prof. F. J. M. Stratton dealt with the relations of the Organisation with the international scientific unions, and other speakers in the discussion indicated the wide range of fascinating subjects with which it is already concerned. Its major activities have since been reviewed in a progress report by Dr. W. H. C. Laves, the deputy director, in the United Nations Weekly Bulletin. Already some 72 million dollars' worth of material has been collected by voluntary agencies, chiefly in the United States, under the Temporary International Council for Educational Reconstruction, and fifty sets of laboratory equipment have been collected for consignment to forty-one selected laboratories in five countries. Technical needs in the fields of the Press, radio and films have been surveyed in some eight or ten war-devastated countries. It is expected that a conference at Nanking will encourage a pilot project on fundamental education, for which the Organisation will provide an adviser; and consultant-advisers for pilot projects in the same field are also to be provided for the Governments of Haiti and Nyasaland. The Organisation is also vitally concerned with mobilizing social scientists throughout the world for an inquiry into the tensions affecting international understanding, and a preliminary outline on this study has been distributed to nearly five hundred workers in this field in twenty-nine countries. Preparations are under way for a conference on the social sciences in 1948."
