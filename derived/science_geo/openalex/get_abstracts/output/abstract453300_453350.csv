https://openalex.org/W2131222241,"The public health burden of dengue is unknown; here cartographic approaches are used to provide insight into the global, regional and national burden of dengue, with the finding that the global number of infections per year is around 390 million, more than three times the estimate of the World Health Organization. The mosquito-borne viral infection dengue is found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, predominantly in urban and semi-urban areas. The incidence of dengue is on the increase, but the current global distribution is poorly known. Simon Hay and colleagues have applied novel mapping techniques to an extensive evidence base of nearly 10,000 case records. The outcome is an estimate of around 390 million new infections per year, more than double the most recent estimate from the World Health Organization. Importantly, this work extends the mapping to provide global estimates of the symptomatic and asymptomatic dengue case burden, at 96 and 294 million, respectively. Dengue is a systemic viral infection transmitted between humans by Aedes mosquitoes1. For some patients, dengue is a life-threatening illness2. There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial vector control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread3. The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection4 and its public health burden are poorly known2,5. Here we undertake an exhaustive assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall, temperature and the degree of urbanization. Using cartographic approaches, we estimate there to be 390 million (95% credible interval 284–528) dengue infections per year, of which 96 million (67–136) manifest apparently (any level of disease severity). This infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the World Health Organization2. Stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison with national dengue reporting, after taking into account the probability of an apparent infection being formally reported. The most notable differences are discussed. These new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into the global, regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue. We anticipate that they will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about the global impact of this disease and will help to guide improvements in disease control strategies using vaccine, drug and vector control methods, and in their economic evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2078599166,"The long-noted association of red meat with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease may be due to ingestion of a specific compound found in red meat, l-carnitine. The ability of this compound to promote atherosclerosis in mice requires that it be further metabolized by the gut microbiota. In humans, omnivores but not vegans or vegetarians metabolize l-carnitine in this manner, a difference which may be explained by effects of diet on the presence of specific types of bacteria in the gut. Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine (TMA), which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary l-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice. Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of l-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism. The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status. Plasma l-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation (n = 2,595) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and incident major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke or death), but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels. Chronic dietary l-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed. In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota, dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport. Intestinal microbiota may thus contribute to the well-established link between high levels of red meat consumption and CVD risk."
https://openalex.org/W2104397341,"The p53 tumor suppressor can restrict malignant transformation by triggering cell-autonomous programs of cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. p53 also promotes cellular senescence, a tumor-suppressive program that involves stable cell-cycle arrest and secretion of factors that modify the tissue microenvironment. In the presence of chronic liver damage, we show that ablation of a p53-dependent senescence program in hepatic stellate cells increases liver fibrosis and cirrhosis associated with reduced survival and enhances the transformation of adjacent epithelial cells into hepatocellular carcinoma. p53-expressing senescent stellate cells release factors that skew macrophage polarization toward a tumor-inhibiting M1-state capable of attacking senescent cells in culture, whereas proliferating p53-deficient stellate cells secrete factors that stimulate polarization of macrophages into a tumor-promoting M2-state and enhance the proliferation of premalignant cells. Hence, p53 can act non-cell autonomously to suppress tumorigenesis by promoting an antitumor microenvironment, in part, through secreted factors that modulate macrophage function."

https://openalex.org/W2141859364,"The PDZ-domain-containing sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) promotes recycling of internalized transmembrane proteins from endosomes to the plasma membrane by linking PDZ-dependent cargo recognition to retromer-mediated transport. Here, we employed quantitative proteomics of the SNX27 interactome and quantification of the surface proteome of SNX27- and retromer-suppressed cells to dissect the assembly of the SNX27 complex and provide an unbiased global view of SNX27-mediated sorting. Over 100 cell surface proteins, many of which interact with SNX27, including the glucose transporter GLUT1, the Menkes disease copper transporter ATP7A, various zinc and amino acid transporters, and numerous signalling receptors, require SNX27–retromer to prevent lysosomal degradation and maintain surface levels. Furthermore, we establish that direct interaction of the SNX27 PDZ domain with the retromer subunit VPS26 is necessary and sufficient to prevent lysosomal entry of SNX27 cargo. Our data identify the SNX27–retromer as a major endosomal recycling hub required to maintain cellular nutrient homeostasis. Internalized transmembrane proteins can be recycled to the plasma membrane by SNX27–retromer-mediated transport. Cullen and colleagues have done a global analysis of retromer-mediated transport by combining quantitative proteomics to delineate the SNX27 interactome and an analysis of the surface proteome of SNX27- or retromer-suppressed cells. They show that the SNX27–retromer complex recycles proteins involved in maintaining cellular nutrient homeostasis and is required to prevent lysosomal degradation of the recycling cargoes."
https://openalex.org/W2012701284,"The CXXC domains of TET2 (encoded by the distinct gene IDAX) and TET3 are found to have previously unknown roles in the regulation of TET proteins through the activation of caspases and subsequent reduction in TET catalytic activity; this regulation is dependent on DNA binding through the CXXC domain. TET family proteins modify the methylation status of DNA by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC, sometimes called the 'fifth base' of DNA) and other intermediates. TET1 and TET3 contain a CXXC domain but the ancestral CXXC domain of TET2 is encoded by a distinct gene, IDAX (or CXXC4). This paper demonstrates that IDAX binds unmethylated CpG-rich DNA via its CXXC domain and recruits TET2. The separate and linked CXXC domains of TET2 and TET3 are shown to act as regulators of caspase activation and TET enzymatic activity. The authors suggest that future studies should focus on the genomic targets of TET2, IDAX and the IDAX-related protein CXXC5 in normal development and in cancer. TET (ten-eleven-translocation) proteins are Fe(ii)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases1,2,3 that modify the methylation status of DNA by successively oxidizing 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxycytosine1,3,4,5, potential intermediates in the active erasure of DNA-methylation marks5,6. Here we show that IDAX (also known as CXXC4), a reported inhibitor of Wnt signalling7 that has been implicated in malignant renal cell carcinoma8 and colonic villous adenoma9, regulates TET2 protein expression. IDAX was originally encoded within an ancestral TET2 gene that underwent a chromosomal gene inversion during evolution, thus separating the TET2 CXXC domain from the catalytic domain. The IDAX CXXC domain binds DNA sequences containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, localizes to promoters and CpG islands in genomic DNA and interacts directly with the catalytic domain of TET2. Unexpectedly, IDAX expression results in caspase activation and TET2 protein downregulation, in a manner that depends on DNA binding through the IDAX CXXC domain, suggesting that IDAX recruits TET2 to DNA before degradation. IDAX depletion prevents TET2 downregulation in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and short hairpin RNA against IDAX increases TET2 protein expression in the human monocytic cell line U937. Notably, we find that the expression and activity of TET3 is also regulated through its CXXC domain. Taken together, these results establish the separate and linked CXXC domains of TET2 and TET3, respectively, as previously unknown regulators of caspase activation and TET enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2089023364,"In this study, the authors show that transposable element activity increases in the Drosophila brain with advancing age. Mutating the Drosophila Argonaute 2 (Ago2) gene exacerbated age-related transposable element activity and led to impaired memory and shortened lifespan. We found that several transposable elements were highly active in Drosophila brain during normal aging. In addition, we found that mutations in Drosophila Argonaute 2 (Ago2) resulted in exacerbated transposon expression in the brain, progressive and age-dependent memory impairment, and shortened lifespan. These findings suggest that transposon activation may contribute to age-dependent loss of neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W2114559206,"Computational design of protein function involves a search for amino acids with the lowest energy subject to a set of constraints specifying function. In many cases a set of natural protein backbone structures, or ""scaffolds"", are searched to find regions where functional sites (an enzyme active site, ligand binding pocket, protein-protein interaction region, etc.) can be placed, and the identities of the surrounding amino acids are optimized to satisfy functional constraints. Input native protein structures almost invariably have regions that score very poorly with the design force field, and any design based on these unmodified structures may result in mutations away from the native sequence solely as a result of the energetic strain. Because the input structure is already a stable protein, it is desirable to keep the total number of mutations to a minimum and to avoid mutations resulting from poorly-scoring input structures. Here we describe a protocol using cycles of minimization with combined backbone/sidechain restraints that is Pareto-optimal with respect to RMSD to the native structure and energetic strain reduction. The protocol should be broadly useful in the preparation of scaffold libraries for functional site design."

https://openalex.org/W2001985793,"It has been thought that a switch by the muscle from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis is associated with the development of insulin resistance. Jiandie Lin and colleagues now show that transgenic mice that undergo this switch, due to modest overexpression of Baf60c, are actually more glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive compared to wild-type mice when both are placed on a high-fat diet, suggesting the switch is actually an adaptive process. A shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism has been associated with skeletal muscle insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes1,2,3,4,5. However, whether this metabolic switch is deleterious or adaptive remains under debate6,7,8, in part because of a limited understanding of the regulatory network that directs the metabolic and contractile specification of fast-twitch glycolytic muscle. Here we show that Baf60c (also called Smarcd3), a transcriptional cofactor enriched in fast-twitch muscle, promotes a switch from oxidative to glycolytic myofiber type through DEP domain–containing mTOR-interacting protein (Deptor)-mediated Akt activation. Muscle-specific transgenic expression of Baf60c activates a program of molecular, metabolic and contractile changes characteristic of glycolytic muscle. In addition, Baf60c is required for maintaining glycolytic capacity in adult skeletal muscle in vivo. Baf60c expression is significantly lower in skeletal muscle from obese mice compared to that from lean mice. Activation of the glycolytic muscle program by transgenic expression of Baf60c protects mice from diet-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Deptor is induced by the Baf60c-Six4 transcriptional complex and mediates activation of Akt and glycolytic metabolism by Baf60c in a cell-autonomous manner. This work defines a fundamental mechanism underlying the specification of fast-twitch glycolytic muscle and illustrates that the oxidative-to-glycolytic metabolic shift in skeletal muscle is potentially adaptive and beneficial in the diabetic state."
https://openalex.org/W2099509295,"Ana Cvejic, Willem Ouwehand, Cornelis Albers and colleagues show that homozygosity for a null allele of SMIM1 is responsible for the Vel– blood group phenotype. The blood group Vel was discovered 60 years ago1, but the underlying gene is unknown. Individuals negative for the Vel antigen are rare and are required for the safe transfusion of patients with antibodies to Vel2. To identify the responsible gene, we sequenced the exomes of five individuals negative for the Vel antigen and found that four were homozygous and one was heterozygous for a low-frequency 17-nucleotide frameshift deletion in the gene encoding the 78-amino-acid transmembrane protein SMIM1. A follow-up study showing that 59 of 64 Vel-negative individuals were homozygous for the same deletion and expression of the Vel antigen on SMIM1-transfected cells confirm SMIM1 as the gene underlying the Vel blood group. An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), the common SNP rs1175550 contributes to variable expression of the Vel antigen (P = 0.003) and influences the mean hemoglobin concentration of red blood cells (RBCs; P = 8.6 × 10−15)3. In vivo, zebrafish with smim1 knockdown showed a mild reduction in the number of RBCs, identifying SMIM1 as a new regulator of RBC formation. Our findings are of immediate relevance, as the homozygous presence of the deletion allows the unequivocal identification of Vel-negative blood donors."
https://openalex.org/W1978947310,"The Hippo pathway plays a key role in controlling organ growth in many animal species and its deregulation is associated with different types of cancer. Understanding the regulation of the Hippo pathway and discovering upstream regulators is thus a major quest. Interestingly, while the core of the Hippo pathway contains a highly conserved kinase cascade, different components have been identified as upstream regulators in Drosophila and vertebrates. However, whether the regulation of the Hippo pathway is indeed different between Drosophila and vertebrates or whether these differences are due to our limited analysis of these components in different organisms is not known. Here we show that the mouse Fat4 cadherin, the ortholog of the Hippo pathway regulator Fat in Drosophila, does not apparently regulate the Hippo pathway in the murine liver. In fact, we uncovered an evolutionary shift in many of the known upstream regulators at the base of the arthropod lineage. In this evolutionary transition, Fat and the adaptor protein Expanded gained novel domains that connected them to the Hippo pathway, whereas the cell-adhesion receptor Echinoid evolved as a new protein. Subsequently, the junctional adaptor protein Angiomotin (Amot) was lost and the downstream effector Yap lost its PDZ-binding motif that interacts with cell junction proteins. We conclude that fundamental differences exist in the upstream regulatory mechanisms of Hippo signaling between Drosophila and vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2161939453,"Cancer is a leading cause of death and still awaits effective therapies. Rapid industrialization has contributed to increase in incidence of cancer. One of the reasons why most of the cancers fail therapy is due to their metastatic property. Hence identification of factors leading to metastasis is highly important to design effective and novel anti-cancer therapeutics. In our earlier study (Inoue, A., Sawata, S. Y., Taira, K., and Wadhwa, R. (2007) Loss-of-function screening by randomized intracellular antibodies: identification of hnRNP-K as a potential target for metastasis. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 8983-8988), we had reported that the involvement of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) in metastasis. Here, we established hnRNP-K-overexpressing and -underexpressing derivative cell lines and examined their proliferation and metastatic properties in vitro and in vivo. Whereas hnRNP-K compromised cells showed delayed tumor growth, its overexpression resulted in enhanced malignancy and metastasis. Molecular basis of the hnRNP-K induced malignant and metastatic phenotypes was dissected by cDNA microarray and pathway analyses. We found that the hnRNP-K regulates extracellular matrix, cell motility, and angiogenesis pathways. Involvement of the selected genes (Cck, Mmp-3, Ptgs2, and Ctgf) and pathways was validated by gene-specific expression analysis. Our results demonstrated that the hnRNP-K is a potential target for metastasis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2125799767,"Background DNA barcoding of rain forest trees could potentially help biologists identify species and discover new ones. However, DNA barcodes cannot always distinguish between closely related species, and the size and completeness of barcode databases are key parameters for their successful application. We test the ability of rbcL, matK and trnH-psbA plastid DNA markers to identify rain forest trees at two sites in Atlantic central Africa under the assumption that a database is exhaustive in terms of species content, but not necessarily in terms of haplotype diversity within species. Methodology/Principal Findings We assess the accuracy of identification to species or genus using a genetic distance matrix between samples either based on a global multiple sequence alignment (GD) or on a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Where a local database is available (within a 50 ha plot), barcoding was generally reliable for genus identification (95–100% success), but less for species identification (71–88%). Using a single marker, best results for species identification were obtained with trnH-psbA. There was a significant decrease of barcoding success in species-rich clades. When the local database was used to identify the genus of trees from another region and did include all genera from the query individuals but not all species, genus identification success decreased to 84–90%. The GD method performed best but a global multiple sequence alignment is not applicable on trnH-psbA. Conclusions/Significance Barcoding is a useful tool to assign unidentified African rain forest trees to a genus, but identification to a species is less reliable, especially in species-rich clades, even using an exhaustive local database. Combining two markers improves the accuracy of species identification but it would only marginally improve genus identification. Finally, we highlight some limitations of the BLAST algorithm as currently implemented and suggest possible improvements for barcoding applications."
https://openalex.org/W2066183427,"Exposure to a stressor sensitizes behavioral and hormonal responses to future stressors. Stress-associated release of noradrenaline enhances the capacity of central synapses to show plasticity (metaplasticity). We found noradrenaline-dependent metaplasticity at GABA synapses in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in rat and mouse that controls the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In vivo stress exposure was required for these synapses to undergo activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTPGABA). The activation of β-adrenergic receptors during stress functionally upregulated metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), allowing for mGluR1-dependent LTPGABA during afferent bursts. LTPGABA was expressed postsynaptically and manifested as the emergence of new functional synapses. Our findings provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration that noradrenaline release during an in vivo challenge alters information storage capacity at GABA synapses. Because these GABA synapses become excitatory following acute stress, this metaplasticity may contribute to neuroendocrine sensitization to stress."

https://openalex.org/W1992332701,"Jill Storry, Martin Olsson and colleagues show that homozygosity for a null allele of SMIM1 defines the Vel– blood group phenotype. SMIM1 encodes an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein expressed on red blood cells. The Vel antigen is present on red blood cells (RBCs) from all humans except rare Vel-negative individuals who can form antibodies to Vel in response to transfusion or pregnancy. These antibodies may cause severe hemolytic reactions in blood recipients. We combined SNP profiling and transcriptional network modeling to link the Vel-negative phenotype to SMIM1, located in a 97-kb haplotype block on chromosome 1p36. This gene encodes a previously undiscovered, evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein expressed on RBCs. Notably, 35 of 35 Vel-negative individuals were homozygous for a frameshift deletion of 17 bp in exon 3. Functional studies using antibodies raised against SMIM1 peptides confirmed a null phenotype in RBC membranes, and SMIM1 overexpression induced Vel expression. Genotype screening estimated that ∼1 of 17 Swedish blood donors is a heterozygous deletion carrier and ∼1 of 1,200 is a homozygous deletion knockout and enabled identification of Vel-negative donors. Our results establish SMIM1 as a new erythroid gene and Vel as a new blood group system."

Recent evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as important post-transcriptional regulators in a large number of processes, including osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we performed miRNA expression profiling and identified miR-322, a BMP-2-down-regulated miRNA, as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation. We report miR-322 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells and primary cultures of murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

Furthermore, we identify Tob2 as a target of miR-322, and we characterize the specific Tob2 3′-UTR sequence bound by miR-322 by reporter assays. We demonstrate that Tob2 is a negative regulator of osteogenesis that binds and mediates degradation of Osx mRNA.

This regulatory circuit provides a clear example of a complex miRNA-transcription factor network for fine-tuning the osteoblast differentiation program. Skeletal development depends on the activity of osteoblasts that derive from condensations of mesenchymal cells. In addition, bone is constantly remodeled throughout life, and it requires stringent control of a program of gene activation and suppression in response to physiological signals. Understanding this regulatory mechanism is important for developing new strategies to treat pathological states such as osteoporosis and osteosclerosis. For the specification of mesenchymal cells to distinct terminal phenotypes, cohorts of tissue-specific transcription factors and coregulators mediate the expression of genes required for the functions of a particular differentiated tissue. Molecular and genetic research has identified Osterix (Osx), Runx2, Dlx5, Msx2, and ATF4, among others, as important transcription factors essential for osteoblast differentiation (1Nakashima K. de Crombrugghe B.

SMAD proteins control DROSHA-mediated microRNA maturation.Nature. 2008; 454: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). BMP-2 has been shown to down-regulate a cohort of miRNAs that target inhibitors of multiple osteogenic pathways in premyogenic cells, including BMP and Wnt receptors and their ligands as well as transcriptional regulators and MAPK signaling components (15Li Z.

Interestingly, the few miRNAs that are strongly up-regulated by BMP-2 in premyogenic cells target essential factors for muscle cell differentiation, thereby repressing their differentiation to myocytes. In this study, we characterized miR-322, a novel BMP-2-down-regulated miRNA, and investigated its effects on osteoblast differentiation. We identified Tob2 as its target and showed that Tob2 regulated Osx mRNA degradation. We propose a regulatory mechanism in which miR-322/Tob2 controls Osx degradation and allows an integrated post-transcriptional control of multiple osteogenic genes. pME18S-hTob2 was provided by Dr. T. Yamamoto. pFLAG-CMV-hCPEB4 was provided by Dr. R. Méndez. To determine the target region of miR-322, the 3′-UTR of the mouse Tob2 cDNA was amplified from genomic DNA using primers 5′-TGCTGAAGTCTAGAGACCATCAGGCTT-3′ and 5′CTCCCATCTAGAAAAAGGATTCGCCCAGG-3′ for the wild type and primers 5′-TGCTGAAGTCTAGAGACCATCAGGCTT-3′ and 5′AGAGTGGTCTAGATGTCAATTCGTGCACC for the mutant construct and cloned between the XbaI sites of the pRL-SV40 vector (Promega, Madison, WI).

Actinomycin D (Sigma) was used at final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The following antibodies were used at 1:1000 for immunoblotting: anti-Osx (Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-Smad1 and anti-phospho-Smad (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); anti-Tob2 and anti-FLAG (Sigma); and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:10,000), followed by incubation with ECL Western blot reagent (GE Healthcare). Chemiluminescent image capture of immunoblots was performed with the Fujifilm LAS 3000 device. Quantification of protein expression was performed using Fujifilm MultiGauge software and is expressed as relative values using α-tubulin as a control. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were isolated and cultured as described previously (8Rodríguez-Carballo E. Ulsamer A. Susperregui A.R. Manzanares-Céspedes C. Sánchez-García E.

C2C12 and HeLa cell lines were maintained as described previously (9Ulsamer A. Ortuño M.J. Ruiz S. Susperregui A.R. Osses N. Rosa J.L. Ventura F.

The MC3T3-E1 cell line was maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. To induce C2C12 cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with DMEM without serum, and BMP-2 (2 nm) was added. To induce MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with α-modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS, 50 μm ascorbic acid, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for miRNAs and Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) for cotransfection with plasmids. Transfection efficiency was assessed by GFP or BLOCK-iT Alexa Fluor Red fluorescent control (Ambion, Paisley, United Kingdom). Pre-miRTM and Anti-miRTM (Ambion) were used at final concentration of 20 nm. Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, or BM-MSCs using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx, Houston, TX). 3 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). miRNAs were isolated using a mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems), and reverse transcription was performed using a TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Initial miRNA screening was performed using TaqMan Array Rodent MicroRNA B Card v3 (Applied Biosystems). miRNA qPCRs were performed using specific probes (TaqMan microRNA assays). All quantitative PCRs were carried out using the ABI Prism 7900HT fast real-time PCR system and the TaqMan 5′-nuclease probe method (Applied Biosystems). mRNA transcripts were normalized to GAPDH expression, and miRNA transcripts were normalized to U6 expression. Cells were transfected for 8 h without serum and treated with BMP-2 for 16–24 h. Luciferase activities were quantified using the luciferase assay system or the Renilla luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized using β-galactosidase detection kit II (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). LentimiRa-GFP-mmu-mir-322 and Lenti-IIII-mir-GFP control virus (ABM Inc., Richmond, British Columbia, Canada) were used for BM-MSC transduction at a multiplicity of infection of 1, and efficiency was controlled by the GFP coexpressed in the same construct. Polybrene (Sigma) was used at final concentration of 2 μg/ml to enhance viral infection. Puromycin was used to select infected cells at 2 μg/ml. Selected MSCs were cultured for 5 days in osteogenic differentiating medium (DMEM supplemented with pyruvate, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate). HeLa cells were transfected for 4 h using Lipofectamine LTX. GFP was used as a transfection control. Cells were harvested by adding lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g. Yeast RNA (0.5 mg/mg of protein; Sigma) was added to the supernatant to block nonspecific binding. Biotinylated RNAs were denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and cooled for 20 min in 10 mm Tris (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. 0.5 μg of each RNA was incubated with cell lysates for 60 min at 4 °C, including 200 units/ml RNasin (Promega). 25 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added and further incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were detected by Western blotting. In silico putative targets were screened for each of the differentially expressed miRNAs by three different algorithms: DIANA-microT v5.0 (29Vlachos I.S. Kostoulas N. Vergoulis T. Georgakilas G.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or two-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison tests. Quantitative data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at p values of <0.05. To identify miRNAs whose expression is altered during osteoblast differentiation, C2C12 cells were treated with BMP-2 (2 nm) in medium without serum for 8 h. Independent experiments were performed under the same conditions, and a miRNA expression profile was obtained (Fig. 1A). In agreement with previous results, global analysis indicated that most of the significantly changed miRNAs were down-regulated in response to BMP-2 (13Inose H. Ochi H. Kimura A. Fujita K. Xu R.

Invest. 2009; 119: 3666-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). For instance, miR-206 was shown to decrease during C2C12 cell differentiation (25Sato M.M. Nashimoto M. Katagiri T. Yawaka Y. Tamura M. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 down-regulates miR-206 expression by blocking its maturation process.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 383: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and miR-30 family members are also down-regulated by BMP-2 (32Wu T. Zhou H. Hong Y. Li J. Jiang X. Huang H. miR-30 family members negatively regulate osteoblast differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 7503-7511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To verify these results, miR-30a, miR-206, and miR-322 were chosen for further study. These miRNAs were expressed at relatively high levels in C2C12 cells (supplemental Table 1). To confirm the array data, kinetic assays of BMP induction in the presence and absence of serum were performed, and the expression of selected miRNAs was detected by qPCR. Time course results were consistent with array data: miR-30a, miR-206, and miR-322 all steadily decreased after BMP-2 addition (∼50–60% decrease at 8 and 24 h for miR-206 and miR-322) (Fig. 1B). Down-regulation of miRNA expression to a similar extent was also observed in cells cultured in the absence of serum (Fig. 1C). We extended our observations to primary cultures of murine BM-MSCs and MC3T3-E1 cells. BMP-2 treatment of BM-MSCs or MC3T3-E1 cells for 24 h caused similar miR-322 expression down-regulation, whereas miR-30a expression remained not significantly altered with respect to the miR control (Fig. 1, D and E). We also analyzed differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells in medium containing ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate. In this case, although differentiation led to similar effects as BMP-2 addition on miR-30a and miR-206 expression levels, it induced a significant increase in miR-322 levels instead (Fig. 1F). To determine whether the selected miRNAs affect osteoblast differentiation, C2C12 cells were transfected with mimics of miR-30a, miR-206, and miR-322 and treated with BMP-2 for 16 h. Their effects were first assessed by characterizing the mRNA expression levels of the main osteoblast-determining transcription factors. It is well known that BMP addition to C2C12 cells stimulates expression of known osteogenic markers (1Nakashima K. de Crombrugghe B.

Overexpression of miRNA mimics produced a significant increase in Osx, Runx2, Msx2, osteocalcin, and Ibsp mRNA levels by miR-322 and increases in Runx2 and Ibsp by miR-206 (Fig. 2A). Upon BMP-2 stimulation, ectopic expression of a miR-322 mimic resulted in a significant accumulation of Osx, Runx2, Msx2, and Ibsp mRNA levels compared with expression of a control miRNA mimic. miR-30a transfection reduced both basal and BMP-stimulated Dlx5 mRNA expression. We also analyzed the effects of miRNAs at the protein level (Fig. 2B). Although Osx protein expression increased significantly after miR-322 transfection, miR-206 and miR-30a overexpression led to an Osx decrease, possibly indicating negative osteoblast regulation, in accordance with previous work (13Inose H.

C2C12 cells differentiate into myoblasts and generate multinuclear myotubes in the presence of low levels of serum. However, BMP-2 is able to transdifferentiate them from the myoblast to the osteoblast lineage (34Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 converts the differentiation pathway of C2C12 myoblasts into the osteoblast lineage.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). To investigate whether miR-322 can also influence their myogenic differentiation, C2C12 cells were transfected with miR-322 or miR control and followed up for myotube formation (Fig. 2C). Experiments revealed a complete lack of myotube formation up to 4 days in miR-322-overexpressing cells. We also analyzed overexpression of miRNA mimics in MC3T3-E1 cells, an osteoblast cellular model independent of BMP activation. Similar to C2C12 cells, Osx, Runx2, and Msx2 mRNA levels were significantly increased by miR-322 (Fig. 3A). Altogether, these results suggested that miR-322 might be important for osteogenic differentiation and led us to investigate its molecular mechanisms of action. We then performed miR-322 loss-of-function experiments. Consistently, transfection of Pre-miR-322 led to increased levels of miR-322, whereas transfection of Anti-miR-322 led to a 40% decrease in expression of endogenous miR-322 (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, Anti-miR-322 was transfected in cells in the presence or absence of BMP-2 to assess the effect on osteogenic genes. The decrease in miR-322 levels led to a significantly lower induction of Osx and Runx2 mRNAs by BMP-2 (Fig. 3B). Smad proteins have been found to play critical roles in osteoblast differentiation induced by BMPs (7Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Smad transcription factors.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). The above results suggested that miR-322 was able to increase expression of osteogenic genes in response to BMP-2. Thus, we decided to determine whether miR-322 directly modulates Smad phosphorylation and signaling by performing time course experiments of BMP-2 activation. Ectopic expression of miR-322 led to a slight decrease in Smad1 expression that became significant after 8 h of BMP-2 addition (supplemental Fig. S2A). However, immunoblotting showed no significant changes in the ratio between phosphorylated and total Smad1 levels (supplemental Fig. S2A , left panel). These results suggest that the effect of miR-322 in osteoblast differentiation is not likely related to a direct change in phospho-Smad1 levels. In parallel, Smad1 and phospho-Smad1 levels were evaluated by immunoblotting after transfection with Anti-miR-322 and BMP-2 addition. No significant changes were observed in phospho-Smad activation (supplemental Fig. S2B). The essential role of Runx2 and Osx in bone development led us to analyze the mechanisms regulated by miR-322 in osteoblast differentiation. Bioinformatic target prediction was carried out using DIANA, miRanda, and TargetScan prediction software. Putative targeted genes included HoxA10 and Dlx5 (osteogenic transcription factors); activin receptors IIA and IIB, Smurf1, Smad7, and Smad1 (BMP signaling); and Cdc25A and Tob2 (cell proliferation and differentiation) (supplemental Table 2). These targets were experimentally validated after miRNA mimic transfection. The results showed that the expression of Tob2 mRNA and the induction of Tob2 and Smad7 mRNAs by BMP-2 (6-fold increase for Smad7) were significantly decreased in miR-322-transfected cells, whereas no significant differences wer"

A simple bauplan makes it appear to be the most basal metazoan known and genetic evidence also points to a position close to the last common metazoan ancestor. Trichoplax adhaerens is the only formally described species in the phylum to date, making the Placozoa the only monotypic phylum in the animal kingdom. However, recent molecular genetic as well as morphological studies have identified a high level of diversity, and hence a potential high level of taxonomic diversity, within this phylum. Different taxa, possibly at different taxonomic levels, are awaiting description. In this review we firstly summarize knowledge on the morphology, phylogenetic position and ecology of the Placozoa. Secondly, we give an overview of placozoan morphological and genetic diversity and finally present an updated distribution of placozoan populations. We conclude that there is great potential and need to erect new taxa and to establish a firm system for this taxonomic tabula rasa."
https://openalex.org/W2145414371,"Wamsteeker Cusulin and colleagues report that stress-induced glucocorticoid release can trigger metaplasticity at GABAergic synapses on neuroendocrine neurons of the hypothalamus in rodents. Following stress, these GABAergic synapses gain the ability to undergo long-term depression in vitro, which involves amplification of mGluR signaling and retrograde suppression of synaptic transmission via persistent activation of presynaptic μ-opioid receptors. This form of plasticity may serve as a mechanism for behavioral stress adaptation. Stressful experience initiates a neuroendocrine response culminating in the release of glucocorticoid hormones into the blood. Glucocorticoids feed back to the brain, causing adaptations that prevent excessive hormone responses to subsequent challenges. How these changes occur remains unknown. We found that glucocorticoid receptor activation in rodent hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons following in vivo stress is a metaplastic signal that allows GABA synapses to undergo activity-dependent long-term depression (LTDGABA). LTDGABA was unmasked through glucocorticoid receptor–dependent inhibition of Regulator of G protein Signaling 4 (RGS4), which amplified signaling through postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. This drove somatodendritic opioid release, resulting in a persistent retrograde suppression of synaptic transmission through presynaptic μ receptors. Together, our data provide new evidence for retrograde opioid signaling at synapses in neuroendocrine circuits and represent a potential mechanism underlying glucocorticoid contributions to stress adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2060099800,"Signaling of the pleiotropic cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is coordinated by membrane-bound and soluble forms of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) in processes called classic and trans-signaling, respectively. The soluble IL-6R is mainly generated by ADAM10- and ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding. Little is known about the role of the 52-amino acid-residue-long IL-6R stalk region in shedding and signal transduction. Therefore, we generated and analyzed IL-6R stalk region deletion variants for cleavability and biological activity. Deletion of 10 amino acids of the stalk region surrounding the ADAM17 cleavage site substantially blocked IL-6R proteolysis by ADAM17 but only slightly affected proteolysis by ADAM10. Interestingly, additional deletion of the remaining five juxtamembrane-located amino acids also abrogated ADAM10-mediated IL-6R shedding. Larger deletions within the stalk region, that do not necessarily include the ADAM17 cleavage site, also reduced ADAM10 and ADAM17-mediated IL-6R shedding, questioning the importance of cleavage site recognition. Furthermore, we show that a 22-amino acid-long stalk region is minimally required for IL-6 classic signaling. The gp130 cytokine binding sites are separated from the plasma membrane by ~96 Å. 22 amino acid residues, however, span maximally 83.6 Å (3.8 Å/amino acid), indicating that the three juxtamembrane fibronectin domains of gp130 are not necessarily elongated but somehow flexed to allow IL-6 classic signaling. Our findings underline a dual role of the IL-6R stalk region in IL-6 signaling. In IL-6 trans-signaling, it regulates proper proteolysis by ADAM10 and ADAM17. In IL-6 classic-signaling, it acts as a spacer to ensure IL-6·IL-6R·gp130 signal complex formation."

These responses comprise a series of complex biochemical reactions that ultimately prevent blood loss. In this respect, several anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors, and vasodilators have been identified in most salivary secretions studied to date (1Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Role of arthropod saliva in blood feeding. Sialome and post-sialome perspectives.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Notably, a remarkable diversity of mechanisms accounts for the anti-hemostatic properties of saliva. For example, platelet aggregation is blocked by apyrases or ADP-, TXA2-, or serotonin-binding proteins; collagen inhibitors; integrin α2β1 or αIIbβ3 antagonists; cAMP or cGMP intraplatelet-increasing molecules (PGI2, adenosine, and NO); anti-thrombins; and fibrin(ogen)olytic enzymes (2Francischetti I.M.

Although the anti-hemostatic functions of several molecules in SGs are mediated by well known family of proteins, such as serpins, lipocalins, apyrases, and kazal and kunitz domain-containing molecules, several other inhibitors of platelet aggregation or coagulation cascade have not been characterized molecularly. More recently, transcriptome and proteome analysis (sialomes) of numerous SGs from hematophagous sources revealed that this tissue is a source of an unprecedented number of uniquely expressed proteins (e.g. 30-kDa allergens, yellow proteins, and antigen-5) (1Ribeiro J.M.

McLane M.A. Morita T. Toxins and Hemostasis: From bench to Bedside. Springer, New York2010: 21-44Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Most often, the biological functions for members of these families have not been assigned. Notably, antigen-5 members, which belong to the CAP superfamily (cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins) of proteins, is inarguably one of the most, if not the most, ubiquitous family of salivary proteins, together with apyrases (3Mans B.J. Francischetti I.M. Sialomic perspectives on the evolution of blood-feeding behavior in arthropods. Future therapeutics by natural design.in: Kini R.M. Clemetson K.J. Markland F.S. McLane M.A. Morita T. Toxins and Hemostasis: From bench to Bedside. Springer, New York2010: 21-44Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The function of this family has remained elusive despite its presence in mosquitoes, sand flies, bugs, horse flies, Culicidae, Simulidae, ticks, and venomous animals (1Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Role of arthropod saliva in blood feeding. Sialome and post-sialome perspectives.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Only one salivary antigen-5 member has been unambiguously identified as an RGD-containing disintegrin by incorporation of a typical RGD triad flanked by cysteines not found in other antigen-5 members (4Ma D. Xu X. An S. Liu H. Yang X. Andersen J.F. Wang Y. Tokumasu F. Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Lai R.

In our attempt to identify the function of this family of proteins, we discovered that antigen-5 members from the SG of the Triatomine vectors of Chagas disease, Dipetalogaster maxima (DMAV, D. maxima antigen-5) (6Assumpcão T.C.

DMAV did not interfere with aggregation triggered by other agonists or block the proximal interaction of collagen with platelets. This inhibitory profile resembles the inhibitory effects of antioxidants in platelet aggregation induced by collagen, which is the only agonist-promoting extracellular increase of O2⨪ (8Krötz F.

For example, blockade of extracellular O2⨪ by N-acetylcysteine is accompanied by inhibition of low doses of collagen-induced platelet aggregation (12Tang W.H. Stitham J. Gleim S. Di Febbo C.

Collagen interacts with GPVI, which signals by tyrosyl phosphorylation and NADPH oxidase activation through TRAF4 (24Arthur J.F. Qiao J. Shen Y. Davis A.K. Dunne E. Berndt M.C. Gardiner E.E.

Haemost. 2012; 10: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These steps result in the generation of O2⨪ that is critical to prime the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme for kinase activation (13Leo R. Praticò D. Iuliano L. Pulcinelli F.M. Ghiselli A. Pignatelli P. Colavita A.R. FitzGerald G.A. Violi F.

NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (12Tang W.H. Stitham J. Gleim S. Di Febbo C. Porreca E. Fava C. Tacconelli S. Capone M. Evangelista V. Levantesi G. Wen L. Martin K. Minuz P. Rade J. Patrignani P.

Olszanecki R. Janiszewski M. Laurindo F.R. Panz T. Miedzobrodzki J. Functional role of NADPH oxidase in activation of platelets.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, quercetin, which displays antioxidant properties, attenuates platelet aggregation by collagen (25Hubbard G.P. Wolffram S. Lovegrove J.A. Gibbins J.M. Ingestion of quercetin inhibits platelet aggregation and essential components of the collagen-stimulated platelet activation pathway in humans.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 2138-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, it was found that DMAV binds Cu2+ and catalytically removes O2⨪. Therefore, this report is the first to determine the function of the antigen-5 family of salivary proteins as antioxidant enzymes. This discovery is important, given the wide expression of antigen-5 family members in bloodsucking animals, venomous creatures, and vertebrates (26Gibbs G.M. Roelants K. O'Bryan M.K.

It also highlights the importance of scavenging O2⨪ to attenuate the proinflammatory events associated with dysregulated production of ROS in the microcirculation.

Dextran (non-sulfated) standard 670 kDa (00896) and dextran (non-sulfated) standard 12 kDa (00270) were from Biochemika (Steinheim, Denmark). Enoxaparin (4,500 Da; 100 mg/ml) was from Sandoz (Princeton, NJ). Convulxin was purified as described (27Francischetti I.M. Saliou B. Leduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C.

Cleavage site predictions of the mature proteins used the SignalP program. The molar extinction coefficient (ϵ280 nm) of mature DMAV (gi 344190589) at 280 nm was obtained using the ProtParam Web site, yielding a value of ϵ280 nm = 58,705 mol liter−1·cm−1 A0.1%280 nm/cm (1 mg/ml) = 1.217, predicted molar mass 25,341 Da (224 amino acids), and isoelectric point (pI) 8.57. A sequence similarity search to DMAV was performed using protein BLAST against Arthropoda organisms with a low complexity region filter. The sequences derived from the nonredundant protein database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) are represented by five letters followed by the NCBI gi accession number. The five letters derive from the first three letters of the genus and the first two letters from the species name. The protein sequences were aligned by the ClustalX software program. The phylogenetic tree was created with the Mega package after 10,000 bootstraps with the neighbor-joining algorithm, using the p-distance model as described (6Assumpcão T.C. Charneau S. Santiago P.B.

All percentage concentrations are expressed as the volume fraction of the chemical in water. Synthetic cDNA for DMAV (gi 344190589) was produced by BioBasic Inc. (Markham, Canada). The sequence displays an N-terminal NdeI and a C-terminal XhoI restriction site. The NdeI site adds a 5′-methionine codon to all sequences that acts as start codon in the bacterial expression system, whereas the XhoI site was incorporated after a stop codon. pET17b constructs were confirmed by sequencing before transformation by heat shock of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Cells were grown overnight in LB ampicillin/chloramphenicol agar plates, at 37 °C. Colonies were picked and then used to generate glycerol stocks (25% volume fraction). For recombinant protein production, a protocol similar to that described was employed (30Assumpção T.C. Alvarenga P.H. Ribeiro J.M. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.

Briefly, 30 ml of Luria-Bertani broth (with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin) was inoculated and grown overnight for a maximum of 16 h at 37 °C. Luria-Bertani broth (1 liter with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin) was inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight culture and grown at 37 °C with continuous shaking (26 rads/s) until an optical density of 0.6–0.8 (A600 nm) was reached (∼3 h). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopypyranoside (1 mmol/liter) was added to induce expression, and the flask was shaken for 3 h under the same conditions; cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × gn; 20 min) and washed once in 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before the cell pellet was frozen and stored until use. Pellets were sonicated several times, washed in 20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 8.3, centrifuged, and finally resuspended in 25 ml of 20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 8.3, containing 6 m guanidine and DTT (10 mmol/liter). After 1 h, the sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Twenty-five ml was added slowly, drop-by-drop, into 4 liters of refolding buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris, 0.3 mol/liter arginine, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter reduced glutathione (GSH), and 0.2 mmol/liter oxidized glutathione (GSSG), pH 9.3) under agitation. After 2 days under agitation at 4 °C, the solution containing DMAV was concentrated to ∼300 ml by tangential flow with a 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA). Sample was centrifuged (12,000 × gn for 20 min) and concentrated to 30 ml in a Millipore ultrafiltration apparatus (membrane of 10 kDa). The sample was centrifuged (12,000 × gn for 20 min), and the supernatant was used for protein purification (see below). Antigen-5 members from T. infestans (gi 149898844) were cloned in pET17b and expressed as above except that refolding was performed at pH 7.4. As a control, a lipocalin from D. maxima (DM146, gi 315270899) was cloned, expressed, and purified as above. DMAV (10 ml) was loaded into a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR (GE Healthcare) column connected to an AKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated in 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 0.15 mol/liter NaCl, pH 9.3, with a flow of 1 ml/min. Protein was detected by peak absorbance at 280 and 220 nm, and fractions containing DMAV (estimated by SDS-PAGE) were combined (4 ml) and concentrated in a Centricon concentrator (10 kDa cut-off). Samples were loaded in a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 HR10/30, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 0.5 mol/liter NaCl, pH 9.3. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and fractions containing DMAV were combined. Fractions were dialyzed against 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl and loaded in a Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). To remove bacterial DNA potentially contaminating DMAV, the fractions containing DMAV were combined and dialyzed against 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 6.0, centrifuged, and loaded into cation exchange chromatography using a HiPrep 16/10 SP FF column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 mol/liter) over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing DMAV were combined and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4. DMAV was also purified in a reversed-phase C-18 chromatography column (Vydac, Carpenteria, CA), with a 60-min linear gradient of acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. PAGE and Edman degradation were performed as described (30Assumpção T.C. Alvarenga P.H. Ribeiro J.M. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.

To examine secondary structure, samples were diluted in 1× PBS. CD spectra were recorded over the wavelength range 190–260 nm in a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette using a step size of 0.2 nm, a slit bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a signal averaging time of 1.0 s using a Jasco J-815 circular dichroism spectrometer. Percentages of secondary structures were determined as described (31Whitmore L.

To assess the identity, purity, and solution aggregation state of purified DMAV (17 μmol/liter), analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with in-line multiangle light scattering (MALS) and quasi-elastic light scatter detection (QELS) was performed. Chromatography was done on an Alliance HPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford MA) connected to a multiangle DAWN EOS MALS detector and a QELS detector (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). Spectrum of DMAV (500 μl at 5 μmol/liter in TBS, pH 7.4) was analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy wavelength scanning (Cary 100 BIO spectrophotometer; Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA) using the eluent buffer (TBS) as a blank. Aliquots of CuCl2 (in TBS, pH 7.4) were added in 10-μl increments, reaching a maximum concentration of 100 μmol/liter CuSO4.

Its most common molecular form is composed of the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) collagen α chains encoded by the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes, respectively. Mutations in any of the three collagen VI genes cause congenital muscular dystrophy types Bethlem and Ullrich as well as intermediate phenotypes characterized by muscle weakness and connective tissue abnormalities. The α3(VI) collagen α chain has much larger N- and C-globular domains than the other two chains. Its most C-terminal domain can be cleaved off after assembly into microfibrils, and the cleavage product has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis and progression. Here we characterize a Col6a3 mutant mouse that expresses a very low level of a non-functional α3(VI) collagen chain. The mutant mice are deficient in extracellular collagen VI microfibrils and exhibit myopathic features, including decreased muscle mass and contractile force. Ultrastructurally abnormal collagen fibrils were observed in tendon, but not cornea, of the mutant mice, indicating a distinct tissue-specific effect of collagen VI on collagen I fibrillogenesis. Overall, the mice lacking normal α3(VI) collagen chains displayed mild musculoskeletal phenotypes similar to mice deficient in the α1(VI) collagen α chain, suggesting that the cleavage product of the α3(VI) collagen does not elicit essential functions in normal growth and development. The Col6a3 mouse mutant lacking functional α3(VI) collagen chains thus serves as an animal model for COL6A3-related muscular dystrophy.

https://openalex.org/W1988512225,"The mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E) permits ribosome recruitment to capped mRNAs, and its phosphorylated form has an important role in cell transformation. The oncogenic function of eIF4E is, however, antagonised by the hypophosphorylated forms of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding proteins 1 and 2. eIF4E-binding protein 1 and 2 (4E-BP1 and 2) are two major targets of the protein kinase mTOR, and are essential for the antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibitors. Herein, we report that pancreas expresses specifically and massively 4E-BP1 (4E-BP2 is nearly undetectable). However, 4E-BP1 expression is extinguished in more than half of the human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). 4E-BP1 shutoff is recapitulated in a mouse genetic model of PDAC, which is based on a pancreas-specific mutation of Kras, the more frequently mutated oncogene in human pancreatic tumours. 4E-BP1 downregulation enhances eIF4E phosphorylation and facilitates pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumour development in vivo. Furthermore, 4E-BP1 loss combined with the absence of 4E-BP2 renders eIF4E phosphorylation, protein synthesis and cell proliferation resistant to mTOR inhibition. However, proliferation can be better limited by a recently developed compound that mimics the function of 4E-BP1 and 2 independently of mTOR inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2043832893,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an emerging factor in fibrotic disease, although precise mechanisms are not clear. Calreticulin (CRT) is an ER chaperone and regulator of Ca2+ signaling up-regulated by ER stress and in fibrotic tissues. Previously, we showed that ER CRT regulates type I collagen transcript, trafficking, secretion, and processing into the extracellular matrix (ECM). To determine the role of CRT in ECM regulation under fibrotic conditions, we asked whether CRT modified cellular responses to the pro-fibrotic cytokine, TGF-β. These studies show that CRT−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and rat and human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung fibroblasts with siRNA CRT knockdown had impaired TGF-β stimulation of type I collagen and fibronectin. In contrast, fibroblasts with increased CRT expression had enhanced responses to TGF-β. The lack of CRT does not impact canonical TGF-β signaling as TGF-β was able to stimulate Smad reporter activity in CRT−/− MEFs. CRT regulation of TGF-β-stimulated Ca2+ signaling is important for induction of ECM. CRT−/− MEFs failed to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to TGF-β. NFAT activity is required for ECM stimulation by TGF-β. In CRT−/− MEFs, TGF-β stimulation of NFAT nuclear translocation and reporter activity is impaired. Importantly, CRT is required for TGF-β stimulation of ECM under conditions of ER stress, as tunicamycin-induced ER stress was insufficient to induce ECM production in TGF-β stimulated CRT−/− MEFs. Together, these data identify CRT-regulated Ca2+-dependent pathways as a critical molecular link between ER stress and TGF-β fibrotic signaling.

Enhanced ER stress in alveolar epithelial cells facilitates epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process that occurs in some forms of fibrosis (15Tanjore H. Cheng D.S. Degryse A.L. Zoz D.F.

Despite growing evidence for ER stress as factor in fibrosis, the mechanisms by which ER stress predisposes to or exacerbates fibrosis are not clear. In the lung, ER stress-induced alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis is thought to be a significant factor in the development of fibrosis (1Lawson W.E. Cheng D.S. Degryse A.L. Tanjore H. Polosukhin V.V.

However, ER stress is also associated with fibroproliferative remodeling in tissues such as the diabetic vasculature where apoptosis is not a significant initiating factor (3Khan M.I.

Calreticulin (CRT) is a 46-kDa ER protein that regulates cellular responses to stress through its roles in the unfolded protein response and its chaperone activity (16Coe H. Michalak M.

In addition, CRT also is important in ER Ca2+ buffering and regulation of downstream Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways such as calcineurin and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) (17Michalak M.

Calreticulin−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have decreased ER Ca2+ stores and impaired agonist-induced Ca2+ release from the ER, whereas cells overexpressing CRT have enhanced Ca2+ binding depots within thapsigargin-sensitive ER stores (18Groenendyk J.

TGF-β can increase inositol 3-phosphate levels, thereby causing release of ER Ca2+ (39Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Magun B.E.

https://openalex.org/W2058066258,"The adaptor protein Amot130 scaffolds components of the Hippo pathway to promote the inhibition of cell growth. This study describes how Amot130 through binding and activating the ubiquitin ligase AIP4/Itch achieves these effects. AIP4 is found to bind and ubiquitinate Amot130 at residue Lys-481. This both stabilizes Amot130 and promotes its residence at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, Amot130 is shown to scaffold a complex containing overexpressed AIP4 and the transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP). Consequently, Amot130 promotes the ubiquitination of YAP by AIP4 and prevents AIP4 from binding to large tumor suppressor 1. Amot130 is found to reduce YAP stability. Importantly, Amot130 inhibition of YAP dependent transcription is reversed by AIP4 silencing, whereas Amot130 and AIP4 expression interdependently suppress cell growth. Thus, Amot130 repurposes AIP4 from its previously described role in degrading large tumor suppressor 1 to the inhibition of YAP and cell growth."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of myeloid cell nuclear factor-κB in the regulation of tumor cell growth signaling. We subjected mice lacking myeloid RelA/p65 (rela(Δ-/-)) to a metastatic LC model. Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure significantly increased the proliferation of Lewis lung carcinoma cell tumors in wild-type mice. In CS-exposed rela(Δ-/-) mice, the tumor growth was largely inhibited. Transcriptome and pathway analysis of cancer tissue revealed a fundamental impact of myeloid cells on various growth signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In conclusion, myeloid RelA/p65 is necessary to link smoke-induced inflammation with LC growth and has a role in the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996545433,"Perfringolysin O (PFO), a bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, binds a mammalian cell membrane, oligomerizes into a circular prepore complex (PPC) and forms a 250-Å transmembrane β-barrel pore in the cell membrane. Each PFO monomer has two sets of three short α-helices that unfold and ultimately refold into two transmembrane β-hairpin (TMH) components of the membrane-embedded β-barrel. Interstrand disulfide-bond scanning revealed that β-strands in a fully assembled PFO β-barrel were strictly aligned and tilted at 20° to the membrane perpendicular. In contrast, in a low temperature-trapped PPC intermediate, the TMHs were unfolded and had sufficient freedom of motion to interact transiently with each other, yet the TMHs were not aligned or stably hydrogen bonded. The PFO PPC-to-pore transition therefore converts TMHs in a dynamic folding intermediate far above the membrane into TMHs that are hydrogen bonded to those of adjacent subunits in the bilayer-embedded β-barrel."

Further evidence for a role of NAADP in cardiac myocytes was obtained by showing that NAADP enhanced whole-cell Ca2+ transients and increased the amplitude and frequency of Ca2+ sparks (26Macgregor A. Yamasaki M. Rakovic S. Sanders L. Parkesh R. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Terrar D.A. NAADP controls cross-talk between distinct Ca2+ stores in the heart.J. Biol.

In view of the strong evidence for an involvement of NAADP in cardiac Ca2+ signaling, we hypothesized that it might also play a significant role in aspects of myocyte function. We therefore analyzed activation of Ca2+ signaling upon NAADP infusion in quiescent adult mouse cardiac myocytes, and we studied both cell-based (in vitro) and animal (in vivo) models of ventricular arrhythmic events to evaluate an involvement of NAADP signaling. Our findings indicate a hitherto unappreciated pivotal role for NAADP in fine tuning of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and open the way for novel therapeutic treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.

Hearts were digested with the perfusion buffer containing either 0.1 mg/ml Blendzyme 3 or 0.04 to 0.075 mg/ml LiberaseTM research grade (Roche Applied Science) and 12.5 μm CaCl2 for 6–9 min. A total of 150,000–250,000 rod-shaped cells were obtained per heart. Cells were plated onto laminin 111-coated (0.01 mg of laminin 111/ml, Roche Applied Science) μ-Slide 8-well chambers (Ibidi, Germany) at a density of 20,000 rod-shaped myocytes/ml in the plating medium containing minimum Eagle's medium with Hanks' salts and l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 5% (v/v) NCS or FCS, 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime and incubated 30 min at 37 °C in an incubator at 2% (v/v) CO2 in air. Cardiac myocytes from Black Swiss mice were used for almost all experiments (experiments displayed in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3–FIGURE 4, FIGURE 6). The effect of bafilomycin A1 on spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ transients (SCT) was studied in cardiac myocytes from FVB mice (experiments displayed in Fig. 5). The effects of PKA- and Epac-activating cAMP analogs were studied in myocytes from Black Swiss and FVB mice (experiments displayed in Fig. 4). The effect of BZ194 was analyzed in all three mouse strains (experiments displayed in FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6).FIGURE 2Lack of off-target effects of BZ194 in murine ventricular cardiac myocytes. a, effects of BZ194 of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 was analyzed. Specific high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum was carried out at various free Ca2+ concentrations in the absence and presence of NAADP (0.3, 1, and 15 μm). Symbols indicate the mean ± S.D. of a typical experiment, which was repeated two times. b, [3H]ryanodine binding analyzed at increasing concentrations of NAADP at 70 nm free [Ca2+].

Statistical significance versus control was calculated for multiple comparison by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Dunnett test. c, effect of BZ194 on cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels was analyzed in whole-cell patch clamp experiments. The current density-voltage relationship showed a statistically not significant reduction in current density, when cardiac myocytes were preincubated with BZ194 (2 mm) as compared with incubation with vehicle DMSO (0.5%, v/v). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 3–5). A two-factor ANOVA model with backwards selection followed by least significant difference post hoc tests was applied to investigate the effect of control, DMSO, BZ194, and different membrane potentials and their interactions on current density. d, effect of BZ194 on Ca2+ uptake in permeabilized cells was analyzed. The effect of BZ194 on Ca2+ uptake was analyzed in permeabilized HEK293 cells. Characteristic curves for control (black) and 100 nm thapsigargin (gray) as control for SERCA inhibition are shown. Ca2+ uptake was activated by addition of ATP. Curves were fitted by three parameter exponential decay (tracings in red and green, respectively). Addition of ionomycin after 800 s released Ca2+ from luminal space. e, reciprocal time constant showed no statistically significant effect, when BZ194 (100 or 400 μm) was added to HEK293 cells as compared with vehicle DMSO (0.1%, v/v).

Cardiac myocytes were loaded with Fura-2/AM (4 μm final concentration) in plating medium in a reaction tube for 30 min at room temperature. Myocytes were washed twice with plating medium. For some experiments, cells were incubated with 0.5 μm bafilomycin A1 or 0.4% (v/v) DMSO for 20 min after loading with Fura-2/AM.

The RNA binding protein CUGBP1 is a key regulator of translation of CCAAT enhancer binding protein β and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). These proteins form complexes that are involved in the regulation of liver biology. Here we show a critical role of the translational activation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β-HDAC1 complexes in the development of liver cancer mediated by diethylnitrosamine. We found that diethylnitrosamine increases the levels of CUGBP1 and activates CUGBP1 by phosphorylation, leading to the formation of the CUGBP1-eIF2 complex, which is an activator of translation of CUGBP1-dependent mRNAs. The elevation of the CUGBP1-eIF2 complex increases translation of C/EBPβ and HDAC1, resulting in an increase of C/EBPβ-HDAC1 complexes at later stages of liver cancer. We found that C/EBPβ-HDAC1 complexes repress promoters of three key regulators of liver functions: p53, SIRT1, and PGC1α. As the result of this suppression, the p53-, SIRT1-, and PGC1α-dependent downstream pathways are reduced, leading to increased liver proliferation. We also found that the proper regulation of C/EBPβ-HDAC1 complexes is required for the maintenance of biological levels of p53, SIRT1, and PGC1α in quiescent livers and at early stages of liver cancer. Taken together, these studies showed that the development of liver cancer includes a tight regulation of levels of C/EBPβ-HDAC1 complexes on the levels of transcription, translation, and posttranslational modifications."

Although the accuracy of this process is critical for overall translational fidelity, similar sizes of many amino acids provide a challenge to ARSs. For example, prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRSs) mischarge alanine and cysteine onto tRNAPro. Many bacterial ProRSs possess an alanine-specific proofreading domain (INS) but lack the capability to edit Cys-tRNAPro. Instead, Cys-tRNAPro is cleared by a single-domain homolog of INS, the trans-editing YbaK protein. A global bioinformatics analysis revealed that there are six types of “INS-like” proteins. In addition to INS and YbaK, four additional single-domain homologs are widely distributed throughout bacteria: ProXp-ala (formerly named PrdX), ProXp-x (annotated as ProX), ProXp-y (annotated as YeaK), and ProXp-z (annotated as PA2301). The last three are domains of unknown function. Whereas many bacteria encode a ProRS containing an INS domain in addition to YbaK, many other combinations of INS-like proteins exist throughout the bacterial kingdom. Here, we focus on Caulobacter crescentus, which encodes a ProRS with a truncated INS domain that lacks catalytic activity, as well as YbaK and ProXp-ala. We show that C. crescentus ProRS can readily form Cys- and Ala-tRNAPro, and deacylation studies confirmed that these species are cleared by C. crescentus YbaK and ProXp-ala, respectively. Substrate specificity of C. crescentus ProXp-ala is determined, in part, by elements in the acceptor stem of tRNAPro and further ensured through collaboration with elongation factor Tu. These results highlight the diversity of approaches used to prevent proline mistranslation and reveal a novel triple-sieve mechanism of editing that relies exclusively on trans-editing factors.

MacKinnon R. Crystal structure of the mammalian GIRK2 K+ channel and gating regulation by G proteins, PIP2, and sodium.Cell. 2011; 147: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) have been solved. These reveal one specific site, formed at the interface of N- and C-terminal domains, just beyond the transmembrane segments and clearly involving some of the key residues previously identified as controlling PI(4,5)P2 sensitivity. However, these structures provide no insight into the energetic contributions of the various residues to ligand binding nor explain how multiple residues outside the binding pocket may affect activation. They also leave unexplained the unique sensitivity of Kir2.1 channel activity to PI(4,5)P2 over other PIPs. Using direct binding approaches on full-length Kir2.1 channels, we identify the energetic contribution of specific residues to binding of multiple PIP ligands and for the first time distinguish them from residues that when mutated primarily act to alter channel gating. This analysis reveals that there is a different subset of residues that when mutated disrupts binding of each PIP. We developed homology models of human Kir2.1 channels based on the PI(4,5)P2-bound structure of chicken Kir2.2 channels and employed ligand docking approaches to identify and compare putative binding sites and conformations for each phosphoinositide. These studies reveal that all PIPs bind within the same general pocket but with different conformational orientations and rotational freedom, suggesting an explanation for why Kir2.1 channels are selectively activated by PI(4,5)P2, and the molecular basis of competitive inhibition of PI(4,5)P2-dependent Kir2.1 channel activity by other PIPs. WT and mutant Kir2.1-FLAG-His8 fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from the FGY217 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (2D'Avanzo N. Cheng W.W. Doyle D.A.

Mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. All mutant channel proteins peaked in the same fractions as WT Kir2.1 channels on gel filtration profiles (supplemental Fig. 1A, dashed lines), and only protein in these three 0.5-ml fractions was used for functional and binding assays. Channel activity and lipid dependence were assessed by measuring 86Rb+ uptake into proteoliposomes containing reconstituted Kir2.1 protein as described previously (2D'Avanzo N. Cheng W.W. Doyle D.A.

Counts were then renormalized to counts from proteoliposomes made with 0.01% PI(4,5)P2 to determine the lipid-activity relationship quantitatively. Giant liposomes were prepared using a dehydration-rehydration method in a manner similar to that described previously (2D'Avanzo N. Cheng W.W. Doyle D.A. Nichols C.G.

For patch clamp, giant proteoliposomes were pipetted onto a glass coverslip in an oil-gate chamber(22Lederer W.J. Nichols C.G. Nucleotide modulation of the activity of rat heart ATP-sensitive K+ channels in isolated membrane patches.J. Physiol. 1989; 419: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and allowed to settle for ∼5 min before starting the solution exchange to wash away debris. Patch clamp recordings were performed in symmetrical K-MOPS buffer (10 mm MOPS acid, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.4 with KOH). Membrane patches were voltage clamped using a CV-4 headstage, an Axopatch 1-D amplifier, and a Digidata 1322A digitizer board (MDS Analytical Technologies). Patch pipettes were pulled from soda lime glass microhematocrit tubes (Kimble) to a resistance of ∼1–3 megohms, and data were collected at a sampling rate of 10 kHz, with a 1-kHz low pass analog filter. Analysis was performed using the pClamp 9.2 software suite (MDS Analytical Technologies) and Origin7.0 (Microcal). Binding of channel proteins to various PIPs was assessed using PIP Arrays (Echelon Biosciences Inc.) similar to methods described previously (23Thomas A.M. Tinker A. Determination of phosphoinositide binding to K+ channel subunits using a protein-lipid overlay assay.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 491: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, PIP Arrays were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBK-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 0.06% Tween 20) supplemented with 1% BSA. Blocking buffer was replaced, and PIP Arrays were incubated with purified Kir2.1 protein (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes in TBK-T for 15 min each, PIP Arrays were probed using anti-His Probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Following three more washes in TBK-T, blots were developed on film and scanned images analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ software. Background was subtracted for each PIP (using the lowest value spot for each PIP as an estimate) and densities measured within a PIP Array were normalized to the 100 pmol/spot for PI(5)P as an internal control. To minimize overinterpretation of data, densities were not compared from different arrays without this normalization. Experiments were performed at least twice for each protein with similar results; however, for the sake of clarity, densitometry data are shown for one set of these experiments. Only when a mutation caused a reduction of binding to a spot on the array with intensity <50% of the average for the remaining spots was the mutation considered to have a meaningful effect on binding. Homology models of human Kir2.1 were built based on tetrameric template structures including the chicken Kir2.2 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID codes 3JYC, 3SPC, and 3SPI) crystal structures and mouse Kir3.2 (PDB ID code 3SYQ) open model. Sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW. One hundred homology models were generated through random seeding using the MODELLER 9.10 program (24Eswar N. Marti-Renom M.A. Webb B.

Sánchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Comparative protein structure modeling of genes and genomes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar) for each template structure. Due to high sequence homology (76 and 56% sequence identity or 90 and 78% positive substitutions to chicken Kir2.2 and mouse Kir3.2, respectively), each model was structurally highly similar (1.68–3.07 Å all atom root mean square deviation, 0.21–0.37 Å Cα root mean square deviation) to the template structures in regions where electron density was observed in the crystal structures. However, two missed loops, one that connects the N-terminal β-strand and the sliding helix, and one that connects the two transmembrane α-helices, varied between models. A few derived models that had unphysical bond length and/or bond angle, particularly in Gln residues, were detected and discarded. PDBQT structure files, containing charge and atom type were generated from the PDB file of every homology model beginning with protonation, assigning Gasteiger charge, merging of nonpolar hydrogen to the bonded carbon atom, and assigning atom type using Autodock Tool 1.5.4 (26Sanner M.F. Python: a programming language for software integration and development.J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1999; 17: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar), and then the protein was aligned to the initial crystal structure using MacPyMOL programs (PyMOL) so that the docking search area was consistent between models. Homology models of mutant Kir2.1 channels were generated in the same way, with Arg80, Arg82, Lys182, Lys185, Lys187, and Lys188 mutated to glutamine individually. Previous studies have experimentally shown that the head groups are critical determinants for PIP activations with the Kir protein (Fig. 1B). To facilitate simulations, only the head groups for each of the seven PIP molecules were used in our docking simulations, with the PIPs truncated at the first carbon atom of glycerol moiety (see Fig. 3B). This results in an inositol phosphate singly methylated at the C1 position, which reduces the charge at the phosphate group and better mimics the PIPs than the inositol phosphate itself. An initial PI(4,5)P2 structure and PDB file were obtained using the PRODRG server, and the structure was constrained such that the hydroxyl group was axial at the second carbon position of the inositol ring. Hydrogen atoms on the inositol ring were merged to the carbon atoms. Six other PIPs were generated by modifying the PI(4,5)P2 molecule using Maestro (Schrödinger, Portland, OR). Atom charges for the PIPs were adopted from those reported (27Lupyan D. Mezei M. Logothetis D.E. Osman R. A molecular dynamics investigation of lipid bilayer perturbation by PIP2.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 240-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with PI(4,5)P2 charges shown in Fig. 3B. Autodock Tool 1.5.4 was used to assign atom type and torsion tree for each ligand (26Sanner M.F. Python: a programming language for software integration and development.J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1999; 17: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(5)P had 9, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2 had 10, and PI(3,4,5)P3 had 11 rotatable bonds.FIGURE 3The interaction of individual mutant Kir 2.1 to the PIP Arrays. Mutant Kir2.1 protein bound to the PIP Arrays was probed with an anti-His antibody. The raw images are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Densitometry measurements from PIP Arrays were internally normalized to density measured for the 100 pmol spot of PI(5)P and are plotted for lipids individually. The mutations that caused >50% reduction in binding compared with WT Kir2.1 are designated by an arrow and residue name. These data indicate that for each PIP, it is a different subset of residues that when mutated to Gln (Q) disrupts channel binding. This suggests that these ligands orient differently in the binding pocket, thereby interacting with different subset of residues, which may explain why they do not equivalently trigger activation in Kir2.1 channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The grid space for docking simulation was limited to the region into which lipid head groups can reach with the lipid tail still embedded in the membrane. The membrane was not present in the docking simulations, but its potential location with respect to the protein was approximated based on the slide helix position. The searched region fully covered the sliding helix, the lower end of the TM1 helix, the N-terminal β-strand of subunit A and the adjacent part of neighboring subunits B and D, which was necessary to identify potential interactions at the subunit interface as shown in Fig. 4A. The resulting grid space differed slightly between individual models based on different crystal structures. In particular 3JYC, which exhibits a greater displacement of the cytoplasmic domain from the TM domain than other structures, resulted in a wider search space although the structural parts included for the search were almost equivalent. With grid space of ∼0.34 Å, the grid points were 126 × 102 × 100 for 3SPI and 3SYQ, 126 × 104 × 100 for 3SPC, and 126 × 112 × 100 for 3JYC. Grid parameter files were generated using Autodock Tool 1.5.4., and grid maps were generated by AutoGrid 4.2. program. For each model, 100 independent docking simulations were performed on the 100 homology models for four templates by Autodock 4.2 program using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm (28Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. Automated docking using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm and empirical binding free energy function.J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9151) Google Scholar). All default parameters were used except that the maximum number of evaluations was raised from 2,500,000 to 25,000,000. This ensured that a stable minimum was found in each case. Each docking simulation was run for ∼8 h on a single processor of IBM x3650-m2 nodes for PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(5)P, 10 h for PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and 11 h for PI(3,4,5)P3. For each template, 10,000 poses were respectively generated for seven ligands. Poses were accepted based on their orientation. A pose was accepted if the angle between the molecular vector (O⃗14) and bilayer normal (n⃗) (see Fig. 2B) was >90°, which occurred when the head group was either pointing away from the membrane or less than parallel to the membrane surface. Current and following analyses were performed by in-house programs running on MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) To elucidate representative binding sites the accepted poses were clustered into subgroups. A K-mean clustering algorithm was adopted using as a metric the root mean square deviation of distances of the phosphorus atom to an atom (CZ for Arg and NZ for Lys) of putative binding residues (80 (Arg), 82 (Arg), 182 (Lys), 185 (Lys), 187 (Lys), 188 (Lys)) (see Fig. 5A) was used to cluster the accepted poses. To cluster all accepted poses (N), relative location of a ligand to the protein was used as a metric. The relative position was determined by the distance from each phosphate atom in the ligand to the six putative binding residues. Distances were combined into a vector li{r1, r2, …. rn} where ri is the distance between one phosphorus atom and one side chain atom and n is 6 × p (phosphorus atom number in the ligand). Matrix M (n× N) consists of distance vector li of all the accepted poses, after clustering M is subgrouped into Mk|Mi∩Mj=ϕ if i≠j and ∪Mj=M(Eq. 1) where MK is a submatrix and K is the number of clusters. K-mean clustering is performed according to the following: (i) K poses are randomly assigned as initial centroids {w1,w2,… wK}. (ii) The distance of a pose from these centroids is computed, and the pose is assigned to the closest centroid. (iii) After assignment is made for all poses, new centroids are computed from the members belonging to each centroid and (iv) tested for change from the previous centroids. (v) If centroid is different, steps 2 through 5 are repeated until centroids do not change. (vi) If the new centroids and previous centroids are the same, the clustering is accomplished, and the cluster indices of each pose are stored and performance index is computed according to Equation 2 (29Savaresi, S.

The best clustering was determined by the minimum Q value. The number of clusters for each ligand was determined to minimize the performance index (Q). The smaller the Q value, the greater the intersubgroup variance and the smaller the intrasubgroup variance, which indicates better clustering performance. Five clustering trials on the accepted poses for each ligand were performed, and the trace of a trial with the minimum Q value at any cluster number was chosen and is shown in Fig. 6A. Two clusters (cluster 1 for the larger and cluster 2 for the smaller cluster) were identified. The poses in cluster 1 were subgrouped for each ligand to identify major conformations of bound ligands. To visualize the clustering results based on the multidimensional variables, contact patterns between the ligand and frequently contacting residues were determined. Hydrogen bonds were defined by two criteria: (1Cheng W.W. Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. KirBac1.1: it's an inward rectifying potassium channel.J. Gen.

https://openalex.org/W2023568862,"The large amount of molecular dynamics simulation data produced by modern computational models brings big opportunities and challenges to researchers. Clustering algorithms play an important role in understanding biomolecular kinetics from the simulation data, especially under the Markov state model framework. However, the ruggedness of the free energy landscape in a biomolecular system makes common clustering algorithms very sensitive to perturbations of the data. Here, we introduce a data-exploratory tool which provides an overview of the clustering structure under different parameters. The proposed Multi-Persistent Clustering analysis combines insights from recent studies on the dynamics of systems with dominant metastable states with the concept of multi-dimensional persistence in computational topology. We propose to explore the clustering structure of the data based on its persistence on scale and density. The analysis provides a systematic way to discover clusters that are robust to perturbations of the data. The dominant states of the system can be chosen with confidence. For the clusters on the borderline, the user can choose to do more simulation or make a decision based on their structural characteristics. Furthermore, our multi-resolution analysis gives users information about the relative potential of the clusters and their hierarchical relationship. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in three biomolecules: alanine dipeptide, Villin headpiece, and the FiP35 WW domain."
https://openalex.org/W2106550424,"Scap is a polytopic protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that controls cholesterol homeostasis by transporting sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the ER to the Golgi complex. Scap has eight transmembrane helices (TM) joined by four small hydrophilic loops and three large loops. Two of the large loops (Loops 1 and 7) are in the ER lumen, and the other large loop (Loop 6) faces the cytosol where it binds COPII proteins that initiate transport to Golgi. Cholesterol binding to Loop 1 alters the configuration of Loop 6, precluding COPII binding and preventing the exit of Scap from the ER. Here, we create a point mutation (Y640S) in luminal Loop 7 that prevents Scap movement to Golgi. Trypsin cleavage assays show that Loop 6 of Scap(Y640S) is always in the configuration that precludes COPII binding, even in the absence of cholesterol. When expressed separately by co-transfection, the NH2-terminal portion of Scap (containing TM helices 1–6, including Loop 1) binds to the COOH-terminal portion (containing TM helices 7–8 and Loop 7) as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. This binding does not occur when Loop 7 contains the Y640S mutation. Co-immunoprecipitation is also abolished by a point mutation in Loop 1 (Y234A) that also prevents Scap movement.

After their release in the Golgi complex, the active segments of SREBPs translocate to the nucleus, where they activate all of the genes necessary to produce cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids (2Horton J.D.

This feedback mechanism ensures a constant level of cholesterol in cell membranes. sterol regulatory element-binding protein sterol regulatory element endoplasmic reticulum Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase transmembrane. Recent studies have begun to dissect the functional domains of Scap (see Fig. 1). The protein has eight transmembrane helices separated by luminal and cytosolic loops (7Nohturfft A. Brown M.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Three of these loops are large enough to have structure: Loops 1 and 7, which are luminal, and Loop 6, which is cytosolic. The cholesterol binding site was recently localized to luminal Loop 1 (8Motamed M. Zhang Y. Wang M.L. Seemann J. Kwon H.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Chem. 2011; 286: 18002-18012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Somehow, this binding reaction in luminal Loop 1 must be communicated to cytosolic Loop 6 to change its conformation. One possibility is that luminal Loop 1 interacts with luminal Loop 7, which might alter Loop 6 through a direct action mediated by transmembrane helix 7. We recently identified tyrosine 234 in Loop 1 as an essential residue for the transport activity of Scap. When this tyrosine is replaced by alanine (Y234A), Scap continues to bind SREBPs, but it can no longer carry the proteins to the Golgi complex (8Motamed M. Zhang Y. Wang M.L. Seemann J. Kwon H.J.

When this tyrosine is replaced by serine (Y640S), Scap also loses the ability to transport SREBPs. We provide evidence that these two tyrosines are necessary for the intramolecular binding between Scap segments that contain Loop 1 and those that contain Loop 7, an interaction that appears to be crucial for the transport activity of Scap.

SRD-13A cells were set up for experiments as described in the figure legends. After transfection and incubation with sterols, nuclear and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (17Feramisco J.D. Radhakrishnan A. Ikeda Y. Reitz J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Unless otherwise indicated, samples for immunoblotting were subjected to 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, after which the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters that were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with the following primary antibodies: 0.17 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-HSV antibody, 1–5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-Myc IgG-9E10, 5–10 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-Scap IgG-4H4, or 2.5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-Scap IgG-9D5. For all experiments except the assay for Scap-Insig complex, bound antibodies were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) using a 1:5000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For the experiments detecting Scap-Insig complex, bound antibodies were visualized by SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate using a 1:3333 dilution of anti-mouse Ig HRP (mouse TrueBlot ULTRA, eBioscience). Immunoblots were exposed to Phenix Research Products Blue x-ray film (F-BX810) at room temperature. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the membrane domain of Scap. The protein has eight apparent transmembrane helices and three large loops (7Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Loops 1 and 7 (245 amino acids and 173 amino acids, respectively) project into the lumen of the ER. Loop 6 projects into the cytosol. Loop 6 contains the MELADL sequence that is the recognition site for COPII proteins that cluster the Scap-SREBP complex into coated vesicles for transport to the Golgi (3Sun L.-P. Li L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Insig required for sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap/SREBP binding to COPII proteins in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26483-26490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When cholesterol accumulates in ER membranes, Loop 6 undergoes a conformational change that precludes COPII protein binding and abrogates ER-to-Golgi transport (4Sun L.-P. Seemann J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: Insig renders sorting signal in Scap inaccessible to COPII proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When expressed as a recombinant protein segment, Loop 1 binds cholesterol in vitro (8Motamed M. Zhang Y. Wang M.L. Seemann J. Kwon H.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Identification of luminal Loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18002-18012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The specificity of sterol binding to Loop 1 mimics the binding specificity of sterol binding to the entire membrane domain of Scap. A point mutation in Loop 1 (Y234A) renders Loop 6 of Scap in the closed COPII-inaccessible configuration even in sterol-depleted membranes and abrogates movement to the Golgi (8Motamed M. Zhang Y. Wang M.L. Seemann J. Kwon H.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Identification of luminal Loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18002-18012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The other large intraluminal loop (Loop 7) is the subject of the current study. In an initial attempt to characterize the function of Loop 7, we conducted an alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of the entire loop by systematic replacement of every pair or trio of contiguous residues with alanines. Plasmids encoding the mutant Scaps were transfected into Scap-deficient SRD-13A CHO cells together with a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under control of an SRE-dependent promoter. To control for transfection efficiency, we also transfected a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase driven by a constitutive thymidine kinase promoter, and we included a plasmid encoding Insig-1 to assist in the sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap transport. As shown in Fig. 2A, most of the Loop 7 mutants behaved like wild-type Scap in restoring SREBP cleavage as measured by the sterol-regulated increase in luciferase activity. Four of the mutants showed a marked reduction in the ability to elicit activation of the SRE-dependent promoter (indicated by red asterisks). All of these defective mutants clustered in the region of Scap between residues 640 and 657. All four of the severely defective mutants in Fig. 2A consisted of three contiguous alanine substitutions. When any of the individual residues in these triplets were changed to alanine, there were only minor losses of function (Fig. 2B). Reasoning that the single alanine substitutions were not drastic enough to perturb function, we selected three hydrophobic residues (Tyr-640, Tyr-648, and Ile-655) and replaced them individually with hydrophilic or charged residues (Ser, Gln, Asp, or Lys). Several of these single substitutions severely reduced SREBP-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). For further study, we chose Y640S. To study SREBP cleavage directly, we transfected plasmids encoding WT or Y640S Scap into Scap-deficient SRD-13A cells together with a plasmid containing epitope-tagged SREBP-2. Expression of Scap was driven by the weak TK promoter so as to produce low level expression of Scap, which does not overwhelm endogenous Insigs and thereby facilitates sterol-dependent inhibition of processing. Cells were incubated in sterol-depleted medium with or without added cholesterol. After cells were harvested, nuclear extracts and membrane fractions were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As reported previously (25Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Crucial step in cholesterol homeostasis: sterols promote binding of SCAP to INSIG-1, a membrane protein that facilitates retention of SREBPs in ER.Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), in the absence of Scap, we failed to visualize a nuclear fragment of SREBP-2 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). SREBP-2 was also not observed in the membrane fraction because the membrane-bound precursor is rapidly degraded in the absence of Scap (22Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Failure to cleave sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) causes cholesterol auxotrophy in Chinese hamster ovary cells with genetic absence of SREBP cleavage-activating protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). When WT Scap was co-transfected, we visualized the membrane form of SREBP-2, indicating that the precursor was stabilized (lanes 2 and 3). We also observed the nuclear form of SREBP-2, and this was reduced by cholesterol. The Y640S Scap mutant stabilized the membrane precursor form of SREBP-2, indicating that it bound the precursor, but it did not generate any nuclear form (lanes 4 and 5). When Insig-1 was transfected together with WT Scap, we observed a more profound cholesterol-mediated reduction in nuclear SREBP-2 (lanes 6 and 7). Again, Scap Y640S stabilized the membrane form of SREBP-2, but it did not generate the nuclear form (lanes 8 and 9). We blotted the membrane fractions with antibodies to the epitope tags on Scap and Insig-1 to show that comparable levels were expressed in all of the transfected cells. We previously showed that overexpression of WT Scap, driven by the strong CMV promoter, saturates Insig and prevents cholesterol from blocking the transport and cleavage of SREBP-2 (26Yang T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Overexpression of membrane domain of SCAP prevents sterols from inhibiting SCAP/SREBP exit from endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29881-29886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test whether the Y640S mutant would also saturate Insig, we transfected a plasmid encoding Scap(Y640S) driven by the CMV promoter. As shown in Fig. 3B, transfection of TK-driven WT Scap stabilized the membrane SREBP-2 precursor and restored cleavage in the SRD-13A cells, and cleavage was reduced by cholesterol (lanes 1–3). Scap(Y640S) stabilized the SREBP-2 precursor, but it did not restore cleavage even when driven by the strong CMV promoter (lanes 4 and 5). Importantly, when co-transfected together with WT Scap, the CMV-driven Scap(Y640S) prevented cholesterol-mediated suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage (lanes 6 and 7). This prevention persisted even when we co-transfected a plasmid encoding Insig-1 (lanes 12 and 13). These data indicate that Scap(Y640S) is capable of binding and saturating Insig-1, a conclusion that was confirmed by direct co-immunoprecipitation (see below). We previously showed that WT Scap becomes glycosylated in the ER, and the carbohydrates are sensitive to removal by endoglycosidase H (27Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sterols regulate processing of carbohydrate chains of wild-type SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), but not sterol-resistant mutants Y298C or D443N.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A repeats this result and shows that the Y640S mutant is similarly glycosylated. In Fig. 4B, we used our previously described trypsin digestion assay (9Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) to detect the cholesterol-induced change in the conformation of Loop 6 of WT Scap and the Y640S and Y234A mutants. SRD-13A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding one of these proteins. Sealed membrane vesicles were prepared, incubated with varying amounts of cholesterol, and digested with trypsin followed by treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F and SDS-PAGE. A trypsin-protected fragment of Scap was visualized by blotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against luminal Loop 7 (Fig. 1). In the absence of cholesterol, WT Scap gave a single band of 250 amino acids at ∼30 kDa (lane 2), which is produced by trypsin cleavage at arginine 496 and a cluster of arginines at residues 747–750 (9Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cholesterol addition to ER membranes alters conformation of SCAP, the SREBP escort protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the presence of cholesterol, a new trypsin-protected band of ∼241 amino acids was detected (lanes 5 and 8). The lower band is generated by cleavage at arginines 503/505, which become exposed to trypsin as a result of a cholesterol-induced conformation change in Scap Loop 6 (9Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cholesterol addition to ER membranes alters conformation of SCAP, the SREBP escort protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 24Adams C.M. Reitz J. De Brabander J.K. Feramisco J.D. Li L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The Y640S and Y234A mutants both showed the lower band even in the absence of cholesterol (lanes 3 and 4). When cholesterol was added to the Y640S mutant, the upper band disappeared and the lower band increased (lanes 6 and 9). In contrast, the Y234A mutant showed little change in the presence of cholesterol (lanes 7 and 10). To confirm the interaction of Scap(Y640S) with Insig-1, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 4C). SRD-13A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged Insig-1 and WT or Y640S Scap. The cells were incubated in the absence of sterols or in the presence of cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Membranes were solubilized, and the Myc-tagged Insig-1 was precipitated on anti-Myc beads. The eluted proteins were blotted with anti-Scap or anti-Insig-1. In the absence of Insig-1 expression, no WT Scap was precipitated by the anti-Myc beads (lane 1). When Myc-Insig-1 was expressed, a small amount of Scap was co-immunoprecipitated (lane 2), and this increased when cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol was added to the cells (lanes 3 and 4). In the absence of sterols, Scap(Y640S) was co-precipitated with Myc-Insig-1 (lane 5), and there was no further increase when cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol was added (lanes 6 and 7). These data indicate that Scap(Y640S) retains the ability to bind to Insig-1, and it does so even in the absence of cholesterol. The failure of Scap(Y640S) to reach the Golgi was confirmed by the immunofluorescence experiment of Fig. 5. SV589 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-tagged WT Scap or the Y640S mutant. The cells were incubated with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin to remove cholesterol and stimulate Scap translocation to the Golgi. We included cycloheximide to minimize fluorescence due to newly synthesized Scap. The cells were permeabilized and immunostained for the Golgi marker GM130 using an antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594, which fluoresces red. We also added Hoechst 33342, which stains nuclei blue. With WT Scap, the GFP signal was concentrated in discrete particles that stained for GM130, indicating that they represented Golgi stacks (upper panels). In sharp contrast, the GFP-tagged Scap(Y640S) showed a lacy distribution consistent with retention in the ER (lower panels). The images shown in Fig. 5 are representative of many transfected cells that were examined individually. Of the 1565 transfected WT cells examined, Scap was localized to the ER in 15% of cells and to the Golgi in 85% of cells, whereas in the 1000 transfected Y640S mutant cells examined, Scap was visualized in the ER in >98% of cells. Previously, we transfected cells simultaneously with a plasmid encoding the TM1–6 portion of Scap and a second plasmid encoding the remainder of the protein (TM7 to the COOH-terminal end of the WD repeat domain) (4Sun L.-P.

Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 26Yang T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29881-29886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We refer to the latter portion as TM7-end (Fig. 6A). We showed that these two segments interact with each other as measured by co-immunoprecipitation assays and that they reconstitute SREBP transport activity. Fig. 6B shows a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in which we transfected SRD-13A cells with a plasmid encoding either WT or the Y234A mutant version of Myc-tagged TM1–6 together with a second plasmid encoding WT TM7-end. We also transfected the cells with WT TM1–6 together with Y640S(TM7-end). Cells were incubated in the absence of sterols or in the presence of cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. We isolated the Myc-tagged TM1–6 segment on anti-Myc beads, eluted the bound proteins, and probed immunoblots with an antibody against TM7-end. When both segments were WT, the TM7-end was co-immunoprecipitated with TM1–6 (see pellet in bottom panel, lane 3). There was little effect when the cells were incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol (lane 5). In contrast, cholesterol reduced the amount of co-immunoprecipitated Scap(TM7-end) by about 50%. We observed a similar 50% reduction in more than 10 experiments in which we varied the ratio between the TM1–6 fragment and the TM7-end fragment and in which we performed the co-immunoprecipitation with or without co-transfection with a plasmid encoding Insig-1. All of these experiments were performed by exposing the cells to maximal concentrations of cholesterol/methyl-β-cyclodextrin (30 μm). In none of the experiments did 25-hydroxycholesterol reduce the co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 6B, lanes 6–8, the Y640S mutant TM7-end segment failed to co-immunoprecipitate with the WT TM1–6 segment. Similarly, the Y234A mutant TM1–6 failed to co-immunoprecipitate with WT TM7-end (lanes 9–11). Thus, point mutations either in Loop 1 or in Loop 7 can abolish the interaction between the TM1–6 segment and the TM7-end segment of Scap. In a previous study, we showed that cholesterol binds to luminal Loop 1 of Scap. We also created a point mutation in Loop 1 (Y234A) that rendered Scap unable to transport SREBP-2 to the Golgi complex even in the absence of sterols (8Motamed M. Zhang Y. Wang M.L. Seemann J. Kwon H.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Identification of luminal Loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18002-18012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We used trypsin digestion assays to assess the conformation of Loop 6, which contains the MELADL sequence that binds COPII proteins. These digestions revealed that Loop 6 was in the closed conformation (i.e. the conformation that does not bind COPII proteins) even in the absence of sterols. In the current studies, we have created a point mutation in the other large luminal domain of Scap (Loop 7) that has the same effects as the Loop 1 mutation. In cells expressing Scap with this Y640S mutation, Loop 6 also assumed the closed conformation in the absence of sterols (Fig. 4B). Scap(Y640S) also failed to transport SREBPs to the Golgi as revealed by SREBP processing assays (Fig. 3A) and by immunofluorescence localization (Fig. 5). We considered the possibility that Scap(Y640S) is misfolded and therefore precluded from exiting the ER through the action of the ER quality control system. Several observations argue against this possibility. First, Scap(Y640S) stabilizes the membrane precursor of SREBP-2, which is rapidly degraded in the absence of Scap (Fig. 3A) (22Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Failure to cleave sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) causes cholesterol auxotrophy in Chinese hamster ovary cells with genetic absence of SREBP cleavage-activating protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Second, Scap(Y640S) binds Insig-1 as determined by direct co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4C) and by the observation that overexpression of Scap(Y640S) saturated Insig-1 and allowed WT Scap to carry SREBPs to the Golgi even in the presence of cholesterol (Fig. 3B). We conclude that Scap(Y640S) is properly folded. The fact that point mutations in Loop 1 and Loop 7 block Scap movement raises the possibility that these two loops must interact in order for this movement to occur. This hypothesis is supported by the co-immunoprecipitation experiment of Fig. 6. When we expressed WT Scap(TM1–6) and WT Scap(TM7-end) in the same cells, the two proteins bound to each other, and they could be co-immunoprecipitated. When either the mutant TM1–6 segment or the mutant TM7-end segment was substituted for the corresponding WT segment, co-immunoprecipitation was abolished. Cholesterol reduced the amount of co-immunoprecipitation by about 50% (Fig. 6B, lane 5). This result was reproduced in more than 10 other experiments. In all of these experiments, 25-hydroxycholesterol failed to reduce the co-immunoprecipitation. This failure persisted even when we co-expressed Insig-1 by transfection. Interaction of luminal Loop 1 of Scap with luminal Loop 7 provides a potential mechanism by which binding of cholesterol to Loop 1 would alter the conformation of cytosolic Loop 6. If cholesterol binding changes the conformation of Loop 1, and if this is transmitted to Loop 7, then Loop 7 might alter the conformation of Loop 6 through some effect on transmembrane helix 7, which joins the two loops (Fig. 1). The interaction between Loops 1 and 7 might occur within a single Scap monomer or between adjacent molecules in the Scap tetramer (28Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.-P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Direct binding of cholesterol to the purified membrane region of SCAP: mechanism for a sterol-sensing domain.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The failure of 25-hydroxycholesterol to reduce the co-immunoprecipitation between Scap(TM1–6) and Scap(TM7-end) might be explained by our previous observation that 25-hydroxycholesterol blocks Scap movement not by binding to Scap, but rather by binding to Insig (4Sun L.-P. Seemann J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: Insig renders sorting signal in Scap inaccessible to COPII proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Our findings therefore raise the possibility that the 25-hydroxycholesterol-Insig complex directly blocks COPII binding to the MELADL sequence in Scap Loop 6 without a requirement for dissociation between Loop 1 and Loop 7. Experiments are under way to test these hypotheses.

We show that in most cases the SBHL system leads to a significant increase in toughness. However, the presence of a large number of bonds or relatively strong bonds in the SBHL system can reduce the net gain in toughness. We also incorporate the polymer model into a network of polymers with random properties (e.g., contour length, number and strength of sacrificial bonds, length of hidden loops). This allows us to derive a physically-based mesoscopic force-displacement law that governs the collective behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2067381358,"PDZ domains represent one group of the major structural units that mediate protein interactions in intercellular contact, signal transduction and assembly of biological machineries. Tax-interacting protein (TIP)-1 protein is composed of a single PDZ domain that distinguishes TIP-1 from other PDZ domain proteins that more often contain multiple protein domains and function as scaffolds for protein complex assembly. However, the biological functions of TIP-1, especially in cell transformation and tumor progression, are still controversial as observed in a variety of cell types. In this study, we have identified ARHGEF7, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases, as one novel TIP-1-interacting protein in human glioblastoma cells. We found that the presence of TIP-1 protein is essential to the intracellular redistribution of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin, one Rho effector and the spatiotemporally coordinated activation of Rho GTPases (RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1) in migrating glioblastoma cells. TIP-1 knockdown resulted in both aberrant localization of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin, as well as abnormal activation of Rho GTPases that was accompanied with impaired motility of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, TIP-1 knockdown suppressed tumor cell dispersal in orthotopic glioblastoma murine models. We also observed high levels of TIP-1 expression in human glioblastoma specimens, and the elevated TIP-1 levels are associated with advanced staging and poor prognosis in glioma patients. Although more studies are needed to further dissect the mechanism(s) by which TIP-1 modulates the intracellular redistribution and activation of Rho GTPases, this study suggests that TIP-1 holds potential as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target of malignant gliomas."

https://openalex.org/W2025371473,"Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members can contribute to tumorigenesis and may convey resistance to anti-cancer regimens. Therefore, they are important targets for novel therapeutics, particularly Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 mimetics. Bcl-B (BCL-2-like protein-10) is a relatively understudied member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Its physiological function is unknown, but it has been proven to have an anti-apoptotic activity and to act as a tumor promoter in mice. In human, high Bcl-B protein expression levels correlate with poor prognosis in various carcinomas and predict treatment resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. We here report that protein expression level and anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-B are dictated by its ubiquitination. We demonstrate that Bcl-B is polyubiquitinated at steady state, in a unique loop between the BH1 and BH2 domains. Mutagenesis identified lysine (K)128 as an acceptor site for polyubiquitin chains, and K119 and K120, but not K181, as potential ubiquitination sites. Mass spectrometry confirmed K128 as a ubiquitination site and defined the polyubiquitin chains as K48-linked, which was confirmed by linkage-specific antibodies. Accordingly, Bcl-B proved to be an instable protein that is subject to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation at steady state. At equal mRNA expression, protein expression of a lysineless, nonubiquitinated Bcl-B mutant was fivefold higher than that of wild-type Bcl-B, demonstrating that ubiquitination is a key determinant for Bcl-B protein expression levels. Ubiquitination controlled the anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B, in response to a variety of conventional and novel anti-cancer drugs. Certain anti-cancer drugs, known to reduce Mcl-1 protein levels, likewise downregulated Bcl-B. Together, these data demonstrate that polyubiquitination and proteasomal turnover dictate the expression level and anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B."
https://openalex.org/W1966133655,"The FGF receptors (FGFRs) control a multitude of cellular processes both during development and in the adult through the initiation of signaling cascades that regulate proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Although FGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and the recruitment of Src homology 2 domain proteins have been widely described, we have previously shown that FGFR is also phosphorylated on Ser(779) in response to ligand and binds the 14-3-3 family of phosphoserine/threonine-binding adaptor/scaffold proteins. However, whether this receptor phosphoserine mode of signaling is able to regulate specific signaling pathways and biological responses is unclear. Using PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells as models for growth factor-regulated neuronal differentiation, we show that Ser(779) in the cytoplasmic domains of FGFR1 and FGFR2 is required for the sustained activation of Ras and ERK but not for other FGFR phosphotyrosine pathways. The regulation of Ras and ERK signaling by Ser(779) was critical not only for neuronal differentiation but also for cell survival under limiting growth factor concentrations. PKCε can phosphorylate Ser(779) in vitro, whereas overexpression of PKCε results in constitutive Ser(779) phosphorylation and enhanced PC12 cell differentiation. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of PKCε reduces both growth factor-induced Ser(779) phosphorylation and neuronal differentiation. Our findings show that in addition to FGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue, Ser(779), can quantitatively control Ras/MAPK signaling to promote specific cellular responses."
