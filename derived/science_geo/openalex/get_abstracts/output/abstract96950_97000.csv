https://openalex.org/W1981782871,The elemental content of neurons of the hippocampus was studied by a combination of scanning electron microscopy and x-ray spectrometry in autopsy-derived brain tissue from three cases of senile dementia (Alzheimer type) and three nondemented elderly controls. Foci of aluminum were detected within the nuclear region of a high percentage of neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles from the cases of senile dementia as well as the elderly controls. The adjacent normal-appearing neurons from both groups of patients were virtually free of detectable aluminum. These findings suggest that the association of aluminum to Alzheimer's disease extends to the neuronal level.

https://openalex.org/W1508103020,"The synthesis of 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine (TPD) is reported in an overall yield of 60% based on 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone as starting material. TPD is rapidly photolyzed on irradiation near 350 nm to yield 35% of the diazoisomer and 65% of the corresponding carbene. No internal rearrangement of the latter compound by fluorine migration was detected. Photolysis in methanol yielded the product of a formal OH insertion in greater than 95% yield. Photolysis in cyclohexane gave at least a 50% yield of the CH insertion product at a diazirine concentration of 15 mM. The products were identified by gas chromatographic mass spectra and by 19F NMR spectra. In the dark the diazirine is stable in 1 M acid or base and at temperatures as high as 75 degrees C for at least 30 min. The diazoisomer is much less photolabile and is stable in 0.1 M acetic acid for at least 12 h. The synthesis of a derivative of TPD containing the 2-hydroxyethyl[O-tosylate] group on the para position of the phenyl ring is described. This compound permits the easy attachment of the TPD function to other molecules. It is suggested that the ease of synthesis, dark stability, rapid photolysis, and reactivity of the carbene may make this group useful in the preparation of various photochemical probes."

In this letter we bring together results from diverse types of measurements to give a unified picture of the hydration process for lysozyme. The data come principally from experiments with protein films and powders. The principal aim is to examine the relationship between the sites of water interaction, the extent of coverage, and the enzymatic activity, thus providing a better understanding of the relationship between water and enzyme dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W1509261485,"We have reported previously that five different electrophoretic forms of mononucleosomes (MI to MV) are produced upon treatment of mammalian chromatin with micrococcal nuclease. We show here that each of these mononucleosome classes possesses internal heterogeneity due to the presence of a variety of minor protein species. Defined subsets of mononucleosome classes MII to MV have been reconstituted by reassociating stripped nucleosomes with histone H1 and non-histone protein HMG-17. This procedure leads to the generation of the same five major electrophoretic forms of mononucleosomes found in native chromatin. From the results of one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses on reconstituted samples, it is concluded that different mononucleosome classes possess the following subunit structures: MI, core histone octamer (8-mer); MII, 8-mer plus one copy of HMG-17; MIIIA, 8-mer plus one copy of histone H1; MIIIB, 8-mer plus two copies of HMG-17; MIV, 8-mer plus one copy each of histone H1 and HMG-17; and MV, 8-mer plus one copy of histone H1 and two copies of HMG-17. Equal numbers of HMG-14 molecules can substitute for HMG-17 and generate the same nucleosome components. Thus, mononucleosomes possess independent binding sites for at least 1 histone H1 molecule and 2 nonhistone chromosomal protein molecules. We show further that reassociated HMG-17 molecules can exhibit a rapid interchange between binding sites, even under conditions of low ionic strength."

https://openalex.org/W1579705992,"Abstract Transient and steady state kinetics of the interaction of liver plasma membrane adenylyl cyclase with GTP and the GTP analogues guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P), guanyl-5'-yl diphosphonate (GMP-P(CH2)P), and guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) was studied before and after treatment of membranes with preactivated cholera toxin. (a) In control experiments, GTP stimulated the enzyme partially and without a noticeable lag, while GTP analogues stimulated to varying degrees (GTP gamma S approximately GMP-P(NH)P greater than GMP-P(CH2)P greater than or equal to GTP) and with lag periods that varied with the nucleotide (GMP-P(NH)P approximately GMP-P(CH2)P greater than GTP gamma S). (b) In toxin-treated membranes, transient kinetics and degree of activation by GTP analogues were unaltered, while activation by GTP remained rapid and became as effective as the most effective of the analogues. (c) Toxin treatment had no effect on the concentration-effect curves for GTP analogues but resulted in a 5- to 9-fold lowering of the apparent K alpha with which GTP stimulates the system. These results indicate that the degree of stimulation of the liver adenylyl cyclase by GTP and its analogues is independent of the susceptibility of the beta-gamma bond of the guanosine triphosphate to be hydrolyzed and that lags in progress curves are not due to slow dissociation of resident GDP molecules. The time transients of the interaction of the rat liver adenylyl cyclase with combinations of GTP and GMP-P(NH)P were studied and found to be of the competitive type regardless of the time and sequence of addition of the two nucleotides. The results are consistent with GMP-P(NH)P interacting with and dissociating from the system very slowly and not leading to the formation of an irreversibly activated state of the enzyme. The data obtained on regulation of the basic (no hormone added) liver adenylyl cyclase by guanyl nucleotides are interpreted in terms of a two-state enzyme model (Birnbaumer, L., Bearer, C.F., and Iyengar, R. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3552-3557) and the results are discussed in the light of current views of regulation of adenylyl cyclases and involvement of a GTPase. Our experiments are consistent with, but not proof for, presence of a cholera toxin-inhibited GTPase in intimate association with the liver adenylyl cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1542672873,The transbilayer orientation of the oligosaccharide chain transferred from oligosaccharide-lipid to endogenous protein acceptors in sealed hen oviduct microsomes has been examined using endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H as a topological probe. The oligosaccharide moiety of these acceptors was released by the enzyme only under conditions where the microsomes were made permeable to macromolecules. The release of the oligosaccharide chain by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H was not increased by removal of ribosomes or by mild trypsinization of the sealed microsomes. The endogenous acceptors were shown to be membrane-associated proteins that are not a part of the mRNA . ribosome . tRNA . nascent chain complex. From these results we conclude that the transfer of oligosaccharide from oligosaccharide-lipid occurs at the luminal face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
https://openalex.org/W1595598404,"Cultured human skin fibroblasts incubated at 37 degrees C with sonically dispersed, positively charged liposomes containing sphingomyelin internalized and metabolized the phospholipid. Sphingomyelin incorporation into the cells produced a reduction in low density lipoprotein binding and degradation. Lecithin-containing liposomes were much less effective. In addition, incubation with sphingomyelin resulted in a marked increase in acetate incorporation into sterol. These results suggest that sphingomyelin, which is required by cells for membrane synthesis, can influence the regulation of the cell surface low density lipoprotein receptor and intracellular cholesterol balance."

https://openalex.org/W1517934429,"Two transport systems for serotonin were measured independently in osmotic lysates of porcine platelets. After pre-equilibration with potassium phosphate and dilution into NaCl medium, only the plasma membrane transport system was observed. Under these conditions, serotonin accumulation is inhibited by imipramine, but not by reserpine or norepinephrine, and requires high (100 meq/liter) concentrations of Na+. In the presence of ATP at low (10 meq/liter) concentrations of Na+, only the transport system of the intracellular serotonin storage organelles was observed. Under these conditions, transport is inhibited by reserpine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, but not by imipramine, and requires either ATP or an artificially imposed pH gradient (interior acidic) across the organelle membrane. These and other results suggest that accumulation of serotonin in platelet storage organelles is coupled predominantly to the pH gradient across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2044367379,"The 5′ end proximal regions of the two HeLa cell mitochondrial rRNAs (16S and 12S) have been sequenced by partial enzymatic digestions of the 5′ end 32P-labeled RNAs followed by electrophoretic fractionation of the products on polyacrylamide/urea gels. Likewise, a 600 nucleotide mitochondrial DNA (mit-DNA) fragment, previously designated Δ8aHae, that contains the 5′ end of the 12S rRNA, has been sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert. The first 71 nucleotides of the 12S rRNA and the DNA coding sequence have been aligned and found to be colinear. This observation extends to the 5′ end proximal segment of the 12S rRNA gene the conclusion of earlier experiments, indicating the absence of intervening sequences in the body of the small rRNA gene. A comparison of the 12S rRNA coding sequence determined here (286 nucleotides) with that of an E. coli 16S rRNA gene has revealed significant homologies. Previous electron microscopic analysis of hybrids between the heavy (H) strand of mit-DNA and ferritin-labeled mitochondrial 4S RNAs had shown the presence of a 4S RNA gene near the 5′ end of the 12S rRNA coding sequence. In the present work, a search of the DNA sequence for a cloverleaf structure has indeed revealed the occurrence of a tRNAPhe gene. The unexpected finding, however, has been that the 3′ end of this gene is contiguous to the 5′ end of the 12S rRNA coding sequence without any intervening nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1495367710,"Bovine liver mitochondria have been found to contain an enzyme which will catalyze the formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid via a transamination reaction rather than via the condensation of glycine and succinyl coenzyme A. The enzyme, L-alanine: gamma,delta-dioxovaleric acid aminotransferase (gamma,delta-dioxovalerate transaminase) was isolated and purifed to apparent homogeneity. gamma,delta-Dioxovalerate transaminase is quite stable, has optimal activity at pH 6.9, requires pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor and has an apparent molecular weight of 240,000. The enzyme has high specificity for both substrates. The Km for L-alanine is 3.7 x 10(-3) M and the Km for gamma,delta-dioxovalerate is 2.4 x 10(-4) M. Plots of 1/gamma,delta-dioxovalerate against 1/v at varying alanine concentrations suggested a ping-pong reaction mechanism. Although the enzyme appeared to be a typical transaminase, exhaustive experiments failed to demonstrate reversibility of the reaction. The capacity of gamma,delta-dioxovalerate transaminase to synthesize delta-aminolevulinic acid appears to be far greater than the capacity of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase from the same source. The possibility that gamma,delta-dioxovalerate transaminase plays a role in the biosynthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid in vivo must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1594286156,"Supernatant Protein Factor (SPF), a protein that enhances the activities of microsomal squalene epoxidase and 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase, has been labeled either by acylation with N-succinimidyl[2,3-3H]propionate or by reductive methylation with [14C]-formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride. Labeled SPF preparations, containing 1 to 2 modified lysine residues/molecule of protein which retained full biological activity, were found to bind only weakly to microsomes under a variety of experimental conditions as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. No interaction between SPF and either squalene or squalene-2,3-oxide could be demonstrated by gel filtration. On the other hand, SPF was shown to bind tightly to vesicles of anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid) but not to vesicles of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. The capacity of the anionic phospholipids to bind to SPF parallels their ability to enhance the stimulatory activity of SPF. These observations are inconsistent with the designation of proteins of this type as sterol carrier proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1577035491,"The pokeweed antiviral protein and the toxin ricin are two plant proteins which enzymatically inactivate eukaryotic ribosomes and cause the inhibition of the elongation cycle of protein synthesis. Their mode of inhibition of protein synthesis has been attributed to either the inhibition of enzymatic binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site of the ribosome or its subsequent translocation to the donor site. In this communication, we show that the treatment of ribosomes with either the pokeweed antiviral protein or ricin results in the inhibition of the elongation factor 2-catalyzed translocation of acceptor site aminoacyl-tRNA to the donor site. The inhibitory effects of both proteins are identical and are partially reversed by excess concentrations of elongation factor 2."
https://openalex.org/W1515748391,"L-Alanine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.2) from pig heart was found to be a dimer, with a subunit molecular weight of 55,000 and one pyridoxal phosphate bound/subunit. Seven free sulfhydryl groups/subunit were detected. Isoelectric focusing revealed three species (native pI values, 5.3 to 5.5). L-Propargylglycine was found to inactivate the enzyme at 37 degrees C with a KI = 3.9 mM and an observed maximal first order rate constant, kinact = 0.26 min-1. Incorporation of 1 [14C]propargylglycine molecule/dimer leads to greater than 97% inactivation, suggesting half-site reactivity, while the unalkylated subunit is still apparently capable of processing L-alanine, L-propargylglycine, and beta-chloro-L-alanine. The minimal stoichiometric ratio necessary for inactivation was determined to be 2.7 L-propargylglycine molecules/enzyme subunit, 2.2 molecules/subunit undergoing transamination before inactivation ensues. A deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 3.5 was observed for inactivation with DL-[2-2H]propargylglycine."
https://openalex.org/W1509629264,"The pattern of proteins synthesized by chicken embryo fibroblasts changes dramatically after these cells are incubated at 45 degrees C for a few hours. Three proteins (Mr = 22,000, 76,000, and 95,000) account for almost 50% of the cell's protein synthetic capacity immediately after the heat-shock (Kelley, P.M., and Schlesinger, M.J. (1978) Cell 15, 1277-1286). When mRNAs were isolated from heat-shocked cells and translated in a cell-free protein synthesizing system, a pattern of proteins virtually identical with that made by intact heat-shocked cells was detected. Mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioimmune precipitation with specific antisera were used to establish the identity of in vitro- and in vivo-generated heat-shock proteins. The mRNAs coding for the major heat-shock proteins could be separated by rate zonal centrifugation in a sucrose gradient and mRNAs with sedimentation coefficients of 20 S, 18 S, and 13 S were translated in vitro to yield proteins of 95, 76, and 22 kilodaltons, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W29942568,Abstract A 21-residue peptide analog of the Ca2+ binding Site 3 in rabbit skeletal troponin C has been synthesized by the solid phase method. CD studies as well as uv difference spectroscopy did not show any changes upon addition of Ca2+ to this peptide in aqueous solution. Acetylation of the NH2-terminal residue of the analog resulted in Ca2+-induced CD and uv difference spectral changes and these changes could be accentuated upon increasing the hydrophobicity of the solvent system. It was also found that the nonacetylated peptide showed Ca2+-induced changes in CD and uv difference spectroscopy when the studies were carried out in the hydrophobic solvent system. These results indicate that the complete helix-loop-helix unit is not required for Ca2+ binding to the loop region of the unit and that synthetic analogs can be prepared to determine the molecular requirements of the unit for metal ion affinity and selectivity. We describe the folding of this peptide about a calcium cation based on these preliminary results.
https://openalex.org/W1591660340,"General acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase from pig liver mitochondria, which was prepared as a complex with C8CoA and mixed with electron-transfer flavoprotein, rapidly reduces the electron-transfer flavoprotein to a 1-electron-reduced form (anionic semiquinone). A second electron is transferred more slowly to form the fully reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein. Transfer of the first electron is faster than turnover in the dichlorophenolindophenol reduction assay. These observations show that the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-electron-transfer flavoprotein system utilizes this semiquinone catalytically. A concomitant appearance of semiquinone from the general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase could not be detected under similar conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1595407590,"Three anticoagulant proteins were isolated from the venom of Naja nigricollis (spitting cobra). The peaks of anticoagulant activity co-chromatographed with phospholipase A2 activities. The three proteins were homogeneous by the criteria of electrophoresis in two acidic polyacrylamide gel systems. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate also yielded single protein bands with molecular weights of about 15,000. The amino acid compositions of the three anticoagulant proteins are reported. All three proteins have only one amino acid replacement in the first 25 to 30 amino acids of their NH2-terminal sequences, compared to the sequence of the basic phospholipase from N. nigricollis venom. Removal of Ca2+ from the crude venom caused loss of both anticoagulant and phospholipase activities, and restoration of Ca2+ caused partial recovery of both activities. Both activities were lost in parallel when the venom was heated between pH 6.0 and 8.5. The association of the anticoagulant effect with phospholipase activity contradicts the previous conclusion that phospholipase is not responsible for the anticoagulant action of cobra venom. The previous results might be explained by independence of the anticoagulant and phospholipase effects within the same protein molecule, or by different activity levels of monomer and dimer forms of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W76652370,"Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1572609190,"The synthesis and physical properties of a model metalloflavin complex, [(10-methylisoalloxazine)-(NH3)4Ru](PF6)2 . 2H2O are reported. The structure of this stable, enantiomeric compound was elucidated by x-ray diffraction methods with a final unweighted R value of 0.054. Crystals belong to the triclinic space group P1 with unit cell dimensions: a = 9.631, b = 10.618, c = 13.216 A; alpha = 113.86, beta = 100.19, gamma = 94.12 degrees. Chelation of the metal ion to the flavin occurs at the N(5) and O(4) positions, with a short Ru-N(5) bond distance of 1.979 A. Steric and electronic factors induce a 9.9 degrees bend in the isoalloxazine ring system and a significant lengthening of the C(4a)-N(5) bond. The flavin absorption bands shift significantly toward lower energy on complexation and a new band occurs at 617 nm. These absorptions are pH-dependent and pK alpha values for the complex are 0.6 and 7.4. The spectra of this complex exhibit similarities to that of metallosemiquinone species and arguments are made that a significant amount of electron density is donated to the pi-system of the flavin. Proton NMR studies suggest enhanced electron density at the N(10) position, probably occurring through backbonding interactions. Cyclic voltametry studies are also consistent with substantial metal to ligand pi-electron donation, since it is significantly more difficult to reduce the coordinated flavin relative to the free ligand under the same conditions. Moreover, the complexed flavin accepts electrons in 1-electron rather than 2-electron steps. Spectroelectrochemical studies on the 1-electron reduced complex indicate a similarity with other M(II)-F1 species."
https://openalex.org/W1627581530,"The amounts of DNA in individual cells of synchronized or log phase cultures can be determined from flow cytometry measurements of DNA:propidium fluorescence. We have used a model based on cell transit times through the cell cycle to obtain rates of DNA synthesis corresponding to different parts of the S phase of log phase cells. The five rates predicted by this method for log phase HeLa cells correlate well with those obtained by following the progression of highly synchronized HeLa cells through S phase. The absolute values of the rates can be expressed in channel number (proportional to fluorescent intensity), picograms of DNA, number of nucleotides, or molecular weight of DNA versus time, when the total cell cycle time is known, or in relative units, when it is not. The fastest rates for HeLa and 2RA cells are at the beginning and end of S phase, whereas WI-38 cells exhibited a gradual increase in rates from beginning to end of S phase. The determination of rates of DNA synthesis in log phase cultures, rather than synchronized ones, represents a substantial reduction in time, eliminates the possibility of induced metabolic artifacts as a result of the synchronization procedure, and permits the screening of many cell types that may not be amenable to precise synchronization."

In order to study further this association between propylthiouracil and the GSH S-transferases, we examined the effect of propylthiouracil on the kinetics of the enzymatically catalyzed reaction between GSH and l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and found that propylthiouracil inhibited the reaction uncompetitively with respect to the latter reactant, but competitively with respect to the former (Ki = 0.62 mM). In addition to its activity as an inhibitor of the GSH S-transferases, propylthiouracil appeared to be a substrate. Reaction products between propylthiouracil and several of the lipophilic substrates for the transferases were identified and the enzymatically catalyzed formation of these products obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The specific activities of the partially purified GSH S-transferases AA, A, B, and C in catalyzing the reaction between propylthiouracil and l-chlor0-2,4-dinitrobenzene were 40, 52, 141, and 58 nmol/mg/min, respectively, approximately 1 to 20% of the specific activities of these enzymes in catalyzing the reaction between GSH and l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Similar results were obtained with GSH S-transferases AA, B, and C purified to homogeneity. These studies suggest that propylthiouracil inhibits the GSH S-transferases in a unique fashion by competing with GSH as a substrate in reactions catalyzed by the enzymes."

There is a pronounced increase in the rate of Na+-dependent AIB uptake below 4 x 10(3) cells/cm2, which can be observed both in growing cells (10% serum) or in cells arrested early in the G1 (G0) portion of the cell cycle in medium containing plasma-derived serum. The rate of AIB transport of cells arrested in G0 can be inhibited by the addition of a plasma membrane-enriched fraction prepared from 3T3 cells. The results are interpreted in terms of two elements that control the rate of AIB transport, one dependent on the position in the cell cycle and the other on cell contact. Preliminary observations suggest that BALB 3T3 cells behave in a similar way."
https://openalex.org/W1540759462,"The diffusion coefficients for glucose and sucrose within matrices of hyaluronic acid are contrasted with coefficients determined in matrices of agarose. Diffusivity is similar in 0.5 and 1% matrices of both polysaccharide polymers dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl solution) buffered at pH 7.4 with 0.01 M sodium phosphate. In a 2.5% matrix of hyaluronate, but not agarose, glucose diffusivity is enhanced 3-fold, whereas simultaneously determined sucrose diffusivity remains unchanged from that in the 1% matrix. The 1% hyaluronate matrix will enhance glucose diffusivity if an inorganic cationic serum constituent(s) with a molecular weight of less than 500 is incorporated into the solvent. This enhanced diffusivity is inversely dependent on glucose concentration and on the degree of polymerization of the hyaluronate in the matrix. The presence of an appropriately constituted matrix of hyaluronic acid endows the resultant fluid with several properties generally ascribed to membranes: permselectivity (even glucose and sucrose behave differently), saturability, and the potential to enhance translational movement of selected solutes such as glucose."

We have used this effect to measure the organic phosphate binding constants. Hemoglobin S binds organic phosphates very weakly compared to hemoglobin A. This result indicates that the structure at the organic phosphate binding site is different in the two oxyhemoglobins and may be the result of differences in the structure of the NH2-terminal ends of the beta chains."

https://openalex.org/W1608740387,"When protein synthesis is effectively inhibited in Novikoff cell cultures by various drugs, there is a marked suppression of labeling of cytidiane nucleotides (mainly CTP) from exogenously supplied (/sup 3/H)uridine. The inhibition could be caused by a reduced activity of CTP synthetase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of UTP to CTP, since (/sup 3/H)UTP is readily produced. The variety of the drugs used appears to argue against a direct effect of the drugs on CTP synthetase, since three different glutarimide antibiotics (cycloheximide, streptimidone, and emetine) and puromycin, which has a quite different chemical structure, are equally effective. An increase of the cytidine nucleotide pool size is observed in most instances of drug treatment; however, feedback inhibition of CTP synthetase is considered unlikely because of a lack of correlation between the degree of inhibition of (/sup 3/H)CTP production and the extent of accumulation of the cytidine nucleotides. There is a marked inhibition of RNA synthesis when all protein synthesis inhibitors are present; but almost complete inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D produces only a slight inhibition in (/sup 3/H)CTP production, indicating that the block in the conversion of UTP to CTP results from inhibited protein synthesis rather than from inhibitedmore » RNA synthesis. Examination of the labeling pattern of both RNA and DNA nucleotides following drug treatment gave further evidence for inhibited CTP production. Inhibition of protein synthesis elicited a much greater reduction of the suppression ratio (experimental/control ratio) for RNA-CMP labeling than for RNA-UMP labeling and an even greater reduction of the suppression ratio for DNA-dCMP labeling compared to DNA-dTMP labeling. The effect was also obtained in HeLa cell cultures, but is not restricted to neoplastic cell lines since it was seen with normal human diploid fibroblast cultures.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1548707883,"A new pigment from Halobacterium halobium has been previously described which mediates the electrogenic extrusion of sodium ions when illuminated. Using essentially monochromatic light (0.05 nm bandwidth), maximum activity for this pigment occurred at 590 nm as monitored by passive proton uptake in envelope vesicles. The uncoupler bis(hexafluoroacetonyl)-acetone did not shift peak activity, but did increase passive proton influx. When the new pigment (NaP590) bacteriorhodopsin, the well characterized proton pump, and were compared at their respective wave-lengths of maximum activity, NaP590 required approximately 100-fold more energy to achieve saturation."
