https://openalex.org/W4308994163,"Although artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been shown to be capable of identifying cardiac dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40%, from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), identification of cardiac dysfunction using the single-lead ECG of a smartwatch has yet to be tested. In the present study, a prospective study in which patients of Mayo Clinic were invited by email to download a Mayo Clinic iPhone application that sends watch ECGs to a secure data platform, we examined patient engagement with the study app and the diagnostic utility of the ECGs. We digitally enrolled 2,454 unique patients (mean age 53 ± 15 years, 56% female) from 46 US states and 11 countries, who sent 125,610 ECGs to the data platform between August 2021 and February 2022; 421 participants had at least one watch-classified sinus rhythm ECG within 30 d of an echocardiogram, of whom 16 (3.8%) had an EF ≤ 40%. The AI algorithm detected patients with low EF with an area under the curve of 0.885 (95% confidence interval 0.823–0.946) and 0.881 (0.815–0.947), using the mean prediction within a 30-d window or the closest ECG relative to the echocardiogram that determined the EF, respectively. These findings indicate that consumer watch ECGs, acquired in nonclinical environments, can be used to identify patients with cardiac dysfunction, a potentially life-threatening and often asymptomatic condition. In this proof-of-concept prospective study, single-lead electrocardiograms obtained by smartwatches were able to identify individuals with left ventricular dysfunction, potentially serving as an early warning system for heart failure."

https://openalex.org/W4308942399,"An active trailer steering (ATS) controller is investigated to improve the lateral stability and trajectory tracking performance of the tractor-semitrailer. First of all, a linear yaw-roll dynamic model of the tractor-semitrailer with steerable trailer wheels is established, and the model accuracy is verified. Then a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for actively steering the trailer's wheels is designed. For the LQR controller, the lateral acceleration and the sideslip angle at the center of gravity (CG) of the trailer are taken as the optimization objectives, and the steering angle of the wheel on the middle axle of the trailer is set as the control input. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed controller is tested based on the co-simulation platform under the single lane-change (SLC) maneuver at the speed of 100 km/h and the double lane-change (DLC) maneuver at the speed of 80 km/h and 88km/h. Research results show that under the high-speed SLC maneuver, the designed LQR controller can significantly improves the lateral stability and trajectory tracking performance of the trailer, and cannot affect apparently the trajectory and dynamic responses of the tractor. Under the high-speed DLC maneuver, the designed controller can still make the tractor-semitrailer reach a new steady state in a short time, and improve the vehicle lateral stability and the trajectory tracking performance of the trailer at the same time."
https://openalex.org/W4308964091,"Introduction Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a major cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in adolescents and young adults, is attributable to recognized genetic mutations in a minority of cases. For the majority with idiopathic primary FSGS, the cause of the disease is unknown. We hypothesize that extracellular vesicle (EVs), that carry information between podocytes and mesangial cells, may play a key role in disease progression. Material &amp; methods A total of 30 participants (20 primary nephrotic syndrome/ 10 healthy controls) were enrolled in this study. Primary nephrotic syndrome subjects were grouped based on pathologic diagnosis. The FSGS group was compared to healthy control subjects based on demographic and clinical findings. EVs were isolated from the urine of each group before being characterized by Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The effects of the EVs from each group on normal human mesangial cells and activation of certain pathways were then investigated. Results Based on demographic and clinical findings, mean serum creatinine was significantly higher in the FSGS group than the normal healthy control group. The mean size of the EVs in the FSGS group was significantly higher than the healthy control group. The mesangial cells that were challenged with EVs isolated from FSGS patients showed significant upregulation of STAT-3, PCNA, Ki67, and cell proliferation. Discussion Our data demonstrate that EVs from FSGS patients stimulate mesangial cell proliferation in association with upregulation of the phospho-STAT-3 pathway. Additional studies are planned to identify the molecular cargo within the EVs from FSGS patients that contribute to the pathogenesis of FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W4308964289,"Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the respiratory system, it can also have neurological consequences leading to cognitive deficits such as memory problems. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on working memory function. We developed and implemented an online anonymous survey with a working memory quiz incorporating aspects of gamification to engage participants. 5428 participants successfully completed the survey and memory quiz between 8 th December 2020 and 5 th July 2021 (68.6% non-COVID-19 and 31.4% COVID-19). Most participants (93.3%) completed the survey and memory quiz relatively rapidly (mean time of 8.84 minutes). Categorical regression was used to assess the contribution of COVID status, age, time post-COVID (number of months elapsed since having had COVID), symptoms, ongoing symptoms and gender, followed by non-parametric statistics. A principal component analysis explored the relationship between subjective ratings and objective memory scores. The objective memory scores were significantly correlated with participants’ own assessment of their cognitive function. The factors significantly affecting memory scores were COVID status, age, time post-COVID and ongoing symptoms. Our main finding was a significant reduction in memory scores in all COVID groups (self-reported, positive-tested and hospitalized) compared to the non-COVID group. Memory scores for all COVID groups combined were significantly reduced compared to the non-COVID group in every age category 25 years and over, but not for the youngest age category (18–24 years old). We found that memory scores gradually increased over a period of 17 months post-COVID-19. However, those with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms continued to show a reduction in memory scores. Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 negatively impacts working memory function, but only in adults aged 25 years and over. Moreover, our results suggest that working memory deficits with COVID-19 can recover over time, although impairments may persist in those with ongoing symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4308942420,"The mammalian hippocampus (Hp) can be functionally segregated along its septotemporal axis, with involvement of dorsal hippocampus (dHp) in spatial memory and ventral hippocampus (vHp) in stress responses and emotional behaviour. In the present study, we investigate comparable functional segregation in proposed homologues within the avian brain. Using Japanese quail (Coturnix Japonica), we report that bilateral lesions of the rostral hippocampus (rHp) produce robust deficits in a spatial Y-maze discrimination (YMD) test while sparing performance during contextual fear conditioning (CFC), comparable to results from lesions to homologous regions in mammals. In contrast, caudal hippocampus (cHp) lesions failed to produce deficits in either CFC or YMD, suggesting that, unlike mammals, both cHp and rHp of birds can support emotional behavior. These observations demonstrate functional segregation along the rostrocaudal axis of the avian Hp that is comparable in part to distinctions seen along the mammalian hippocampal septotemporal axis."
https://openalex.org/W4308965551,"Purpose This study aimed to establish the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity equivalence of the proposed biosimilar CKD-701 with the reference ranibizumab in patients with treatment-naïve neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Patients and methods A total of 312 participants with active subfoveal choroidal neovascularization were randomly assigned to either the CKD-701 (n = 156) or reference ranibizumab (n = 156) arms. The initial 3-month loading intraocular injections were followed by pro re nata (PRN) dosing for 9 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with less than 15-letters of corrected visual acuity (BCVA) loss at 3 months visit (one month after last loading injection) compared to the baseline time point. The presence of retinal fluid, and changes in BCVA and central retinal thickness (CRT) were assessed as secondary efficacy outcomes. Immunogenicity and safety were evaluated in both treatment arms. Results In the CKD-701 arm, 143 (97.95%) patients lost &lt;15 letters in the BCVA at 3 months compared to 143 (98.62%) in the reference arm ( P = 0.67). The BCVA improved with a mean improvement of +7.0 (CKD-701) and +6.2 (ranibizumab) letters at 3 months ( P = 0.43). The least-squares mean (SE) changes in CRT at 3 months from the baseline were −119.3 (12.0) μm and −124.5 (11.9) μm in the CKD-701 and ranibizumab groups, respectively ( P = 0.74). The proportion of participants with subretinal or intraretinal fluid at 3, 6, and 12 months was similar between the study arms. The number (SE) of injections were 8.36 (3.13) in the CKD-701 and 8.26 (2.92) in ranibizumab ( P = 0.62). The occurrence of adverse events and antidrug antibody in the study arms were also not statistically different. Conclusion CKD-701 is a biosimilar to the reference ranibizumab in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity for the treatment of patients with nAMD. Moreover, improvement and maintenance of visual outcome were achieved through PRN regimen."
https://openalex.org/W4308992417,"Histidine is an essential amino acid for broiler chickens and a precursor for the dipeptides carnosine and anserine, but little information is available about its metabolism in modern, fast-growing broilers. We used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the metabolic changes caused by the use of different standardized ileal digestible His:Lys ratios in broiler diets with and without β-alanine supplementation. A total of 2204 broilers were randomly divided into 96 pens of 23 birds each. The pens were divided into 16 blocks, each containing one pen for all six feeding groups (total of 16 pens per group). These feeding groups were fed three different His:Lys ratios (0.44, 0.54, and 0.64, respectively) without and with a combination of 0.5% β-alanine supplementation. Five randomly selected chickens of one single randomly selected pen per feeding group were slaughtered on day 35 or 54, blood was collected from the neck vessel, and plasma was used for untargeted metabolomic analysis. Here we show that up to 56.0% of all metabolites analyzed were altered by age, whereas only 1.8% of metabolites were affected by the His:Lys ratio in the diet, and 1.5% by β-alanine supplementation. Two-factor analysis and metabolic pathway analysis showed no interaction between the His:Lys ratio and β-alanine supplementation. The effect of the His:Lys ratio in the diet was limited to histidine metabolism with a greater change in formiminoglutamate concentration. Supplementation of β-alanine showed changes in metabolites of several metabolic pathways; increased concentrations of 3-aminoisobutyrate showed the only direct relationship to β-alanine metabolism. The supplementation of β-alanine indicated few effects on histidine metabolism. These results suggest that the supplements used had limited effects or interactions on both His and β-alanine metabolism. In contrast, the birds’ age has the strongest influence on the metabolome."
https://openalex.org/W4308926146,"RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) synthesizes rRNA, which is the first and rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis. Factors governing the stability of the polymerase complex are not known. Previous studies characterizing Pol I inhibitor BMH-21 revealed a transcriptional stress-dependent pathway for degradation of the largest subunit of Pol I, RPA194. To identify the E3 ligase(s) involved, we conducted a cell-based RNAi screen for ubiquitin pathway genes. We establish Skp-Cullin-F-box protein complex F-box protein FBXL14 as an E3 ligase for RPA194. We show that FBXL14 binds to RPA194 and mediates RPA194 ubiquitination and degradation in cancer cells treated with BMH-21. Mutation analysis in yeast identified lysines 1150, 1153, and 1156 on Rpa190 relevant for the protein degradation. These results reveal the regulated turnover of Pol I, showing that the stability of the catalytic subunit is controlled by the F-box protein FBXL14 in response to transcription stress."
https://openalex.org/W4308925033,"DNA methylation potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, the role of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs: 1, 3a, and 3b), the epigenetic writers, in modulating DNA methylation observed in PH remains elusive. Our objective was to determine DNMT activity and expression in the lungs of experimental rat models of PH. Because the activity of DNMTs is metabolically driven, another objective was to determine the role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in regulating DNMT expression and activity in the lungs of novel loss-of-function Mediterranean G6PD variant (G6PDS188F) rats. As outlined for modeling PH, rats injected with sugen5416 (SU) were placed in a hypoxia (Hx) chamber set at 10% oxygen for 3 weeks and then returned to normoxia (Nx) for 5 weeks (SU/Hx/Nx). Rats kept in atmospheric oxygen and treated with SU were used as controls. We assessed the activity and expression of DNMTs in the lungs of rats exposed to SU/Hx/Nx. WT rats exposed to SU/Hx/Nx developed hypertension and exhibited increased DNMT activity and Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b expression. In G6PDS188F rats, which developed less of a SU/Hx/Nx-induced increase in right ventricle pressure and hypertrophy than WT rats, we observed a diminished increase in expression and activity of DNMTs, DNA hypomethylation, increased histone acetylation and methylation, and increased expression of genes encoding NOS3 and SOD2—vascular-protective proteins. Collectively, increased DNMTs contribute to reduced expression of protective genes and to the pathogenesis of SU/Hx/Nx-induced experimental PH. Notably, G6PD regulates the expression of DNMTs and protective proteins in the lungs of hypertensive rats. DNA methylation potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Collectively, increased DNMTs contribute to reduced expression of protective genes and to the pathogenesis of SU/Hx/Nx-induced experimental PH. Notably, G6PD regulates the expression of DNMTs and protective proteins in the lungs of hypertensive rats. DNA methylation is regulated by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT; 1, 3a, and 3b) and DNA demethylase or ten-eleven translocation (TET; 1, 2, and 3) methylcytosine dioxygenases (1Peixoto P. Cartron P.F. Serandour A.A. Hervouet E. From 1957 to nowadays: a brief history of epigenetics.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others reported that differential DNA methylation and a reduction in TET2 expression may be key to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in mice and humans (2Joshi S.R. Kitagawa A. Jacob C. Hashimoto R. Dhagia V. Ramesh A. et al.Hypoxic activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase controls the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension through the regulation of DNA methylation.Am.

Welch C.L. et al.Novel mutations and decreased expression of the epigenetic regulator TET2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension.Circulation. 2020; 141: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In those studies, our laboratory found that DNA methylation–dependent transcription of PH-related genes and Tet2 expression is suppressed in the lungs of hypoxic mice (2Joshi S.R. Kitagawa A. Jacob C. Hashimoto R. Dhagia V. Ramesh A. et al.Hypoxic activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase controls the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension through the regulation of DNA methylation.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2020; 318: L773-L786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that inhibiting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity increases pulmonary Tet2 expression in hypoxic mice and reduces hypoxia-induced PH (2Joshi S.R. Kitagawa A. Jacob C. Hashimoto R. Dhagia V. Ramesh A. et al.Hypoxic activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase controls the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension through the regulation of DNA methylation.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2020; 318: L773-L786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, two questions arise from those studies: (1) does the DNMT expression and activity increase or decrease in PH and (2) is G6PD involved in regulating the expression and activity of DNA methylation writers in experimental models of PH? While loss-of-function mutations in TET2 are associated with diverse blood cell malignancies in humans (4Solary E. Bernard O.A. Tefferi A. Fuks F. Vainchenker W. The Ten-Eleven Translocation-2 (TET2) gene in hematopoiesis and hematopoietic diseases.Leukemia. 2014; 28: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), loss of a single TET enzyme is not sufficient to efficiently promote malignancy (5An J. Gonzalez-Avalos E. Chawla A. Jeong M. Lopez-Moyado I.F. Li W. et al.Acute loss of TET function results in aggressive myeloid cancer in mice.Nat. Commun. 2015; 610071Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that alteration of DNMT-catalyzed DNA methylation to modify gene expression must occur in PH. To test that idea, we assessed Dnmt (1, 3a, and 3b) expression in lungs of rat exposed to sugen5614/hypoxia/normoxia (SU/Hx/Nx), a model of experimental PH (6Abe K. Toba M. Alzoubi A. Ito M. Fagan K.A. Cool C.D. et al.Formation of plexiform lesions in experimental severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.Circulation. 2010; 121: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition, to determine whether Dnmt expression is driven by G6PD, we performed experiments in a novel rat model harboring the loss-of-function Mediterranean G6pd variant (G6PDS188F), which we recently generated (7Kitagawa A. Kizub I. Jacob C. Michael K. D'Alessandro A. Reisz J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated single nucleotide polymorphism modeling in rats reveals insight into reduced cardiovascular risk associated with mediterranean G6PD variant.Hypertension. 2020; 76: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and in their WT littermates. G6PD deficiency is a common enzymopathy in humans, and there are conflicting reports regarding the effects of G6PD deficiency on the progression and severity of PH. Some studies suggest the Mediterranean G6PDS188F variant makes no contribution to sickle cell anemia–associated PH, while others suggest the frequency of G6PD mutation is higher among idiopathic PH patients than the general population (8Chen L.Y. Lai E.J. Collins D.R. Ostrow D.N. Sreenivasan G.M. A young woman with episodic angioedema, papilledema, and eosinophilia.Am. J. Hematol. 2010; 85: 124-127PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dahoui H.A.

Garcia J.G.N. et al.New cases of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in pulmonary arterial hypertension.PLoS One. 2018; 13e0203493Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used Mediterranean G6PDS188F variant rats to assess the role of G6PD in the progression and severity of SU/Hx/Nx-induced experimental PH. Our findings suggest that increased DNMT-catalyzed DNA methylation potentially contributes to the development and progression of PH pathology. What is more, they further suggest that G6PD contributes to the increase in DNMT expression and activity, as well as modify expression of linker histone1H1 and increase histone acetylation/methylation, resulting in the higher expression of genes encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and other vascular biology-related proteins in the lungs of rats with SU/Hx/Nx-induced experimental PH. As illustrated (Fig. 1A), G6PD-NADPH–dependent one-carbon metabolism and polyamine pathway metabolites (s-adenosylmethionine and spermine, respectively) are methyl group donors and regulators of DNA methylation (11Amelio I.

Redox Signal. 2018; 28: 230-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); we sought to determine the role of G6PD in modulating expression of enzymes of folate pathway and activity of DNMTs in lungs of SU/Hx/Nx rats. To accomplish that goal, we used a recently developed loss-of-function Mediterranean G6PD variant (G6PDS188F) rat (7Kitagawa A. Kizub I. Jacob C. Michael K. D'Alessandro A. Reisz J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated single nucleotide polymorphism modeling in rats reveals insight into reduced cardiovascular risk associated with mediterranean G6PD variant.Hypertension. 2020; 76: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As expected, G6PD activity was 70% to 80% lower in the heart and lungs of G6PDS188F than WT rats (Fig. 1B). Next, because G6PD deficiency causes hemolytic anemia, we compared hematocrit levels between G6PDS188F and WT rats and found no difference in the hematocrit between both genotypes (Fig. 1C). Further, we did not observe hemolysis in G6PDS188F rats and the hematocrit between SU/Hx/Nx G6PDS188F (49 ± 1%) and WT (49 ± 1%) rats was not different. Interestingly, quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics results revealed enzymes that convert s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine to homocysteine (SAHH) increased and methionine to s-adenosylmethionine (MAT2A) and s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine to homocysteine (SAHH2) tend to increase lungs of SU/Hx/Nx WT rats as compared to SU/Nx WT rats (Fig. 1D). In contrast, MAT2A and SAHH decreased in SU/Hx/Nx G6PDS188F rats as compared to WT rats. While we did not find differences in the expression levels of enzymes in the one-carbon and folate pathway by Western blotting (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Elevated pulmonary DNMT expression and activity in SU/Hx/Nx WT but not G6PDS188F rats. Rats receiving sugen5416 (SU) were kept in normoxia (21% O2) or exposed to hypoxia (10% O2) for 3 weeks followed by normoxia (21% O2) for 5 weeks. A, Western blot of three separate experiments show no differences in expression of MAT2A or SAHH but higher expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B between WT and G6PDS188F rats exposed to SU/Hx/Nx and SU/Nx. B, summary results showing higher expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in lungs of rats exposed to SU/Hx/Nx and SU/Nx. DNMT3A was not detected.

SU/Hx/Nx increased DNMT1 and DNMT3B expression (Fig. 2, A and B). DNMT3A was not detectable. Although pulmonary DNMT activity was similar in hypoxic and normoxic rats, it was significantly higher in SU/Hx/Nx than SU/Nx rats (Fig. 2C). While Hx increased pulmonary expression of Dnmt3a (Nx: 0.20 ± 0.04 and Hx: 0.54 ± 0.20; p < 0.05) and Dnmt3b (Nx: 0.009 ± 0.002 and Hx: 0.026 ± 0.007; p < 0.05) but not Dnmt1 (Nx: 1.68 ± 0.63 and Hx: 2.79 ± 1.20; NS), SU/Hx/Nx increased expression of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b (Fig. 2, D and F), as compared to respective SU/Nx control, in rats. SU/Hx/Nx did not significantly affect Dnmt3a expression in rats (Fig. 2E). Since we found G6PDS188F variant prevented SU/Hx/Nx-elicited expression of protein involved in one carbon metabolism or folate pathway (Fig. 1D) and correspondingly pulmonary DNMT activity did not increase in SU/Hx/Nx (22.7 ± 0.63 OD/min/mg Protein) as compared with normoxic (20.2 ± 0.88 OD/min/mg Protein) G6PDS188F rats (Fig. 2C), we measured expression of genes encoding DNMTs in the lungs of SU/Hx/Nx and SU/Nx G6PDS188F rats. Interestingly, there was no difference in pulmonary expression of Dnmt1 (Fig. 2D), Dnmt3a (Fig. 2E), and Dnmt3b (Fig. 2F) in SU/Hx/Nx as compared to SU/Nx G6PDS188F rats. Consistently, expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B did not increase in SU/Hx/Nx G6PDS188F rats (Fig. 2, A and B). Next, we performed immunohistochemistry to determine expression of DNMTs in lungs of WT and G6PDS188F rats. Immunohistochemical assay revealed DNMT1 expression (brown staining) increased in and around the arteries (Fig. 3, A–I and - ii) and in more alveoli (Fig. 3, B–I and -ii) of SU/Hx/Nx rats as compared to SU/Nx-WT rats. While we do not see intense brown staining for DNMT3A (Fig. 3, C and D), which corroborated the Western blot results (Fig. 2, A and B), we found increased brown staining for DNMT3B around the arteries (Fig. 3, E–I and -ii) and in alveoli (Fig. 3, F–I and -ii) of SU/Hx/Nx-WT rats as compared to SU/Nx-WT rats. To this regard, we found less intense staining areas for all DNMTs around arteries (Fig. 3, A–C-, and E-iii and -iv) and alveoli (Fig. 3, B–D-, and F-iii and -iv) of SU/Hx/Nx-G6PDS188F rats as compared to SU/Nx-G6PDS188F rats. Because DNMT1 and DNMT3B expression and activity was higher in the lungs of SU/Hx/Nx than SU/Nx WT rats, we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-PCR to determine differential methylation status of the methylation-sensitive noncoding H19 gene imprinting center region 1 (H19ICR1) sequence in G6PDS188F versus WT rat genome. We found enriched methylated H19ICR gene region in lungs of SU/Hx/Nx (1.57 ± 0.27) as compared with SU/Nx (1.08 ± 0.15) WT rats but not G6PDS188F rats (SU/Hx/Nx: 1.13 ± 0.11 and Su/Nx: 1.20 ± 0.01). Next, we performed methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) using primers designed (Table 1) to amplify methylated and unmethylated CpG islands in the middle and proximal regions of the Nos3, Sod2, Abra, and Serpine1 promoters in the lungs of SU/Hx/Nx versus SU/Nx rats (Fig. 4). We selected Nos3 and Sod2 promoters because products of these genes are implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (14Archer S.L. Marsboom G. Kim G.H. Zhang H.J. Toth P.T.

We found that the methylation index (MI) was higher in the middle and proximal regions of the Sod2, Abra, and Serpine1 promoters in SU/Hx/Nx than SU/Nx WT rats (Fig. 4, B–D).

Further, we wanted to determine whether expression of these genes was affected by the elevated DNMT activity seen in the lungs of SU/Hx/Nx rats. Using real-time PCR (RT-PCR), we found that levels of pulmonary Nos3, Sod2, Abra, and Serpine1 expression were decreased in SU/Hx/Nx compared to SU/Nx WT rats (Fig. 4E). In contrast, expression of Nos3 and Sod2 was augmented in SU/Hx/Nx compared to SU/Nx G6PDS188F rats (Fig. 4E). Next, we performed Western blotting for the expression of NOS3, SOD2, and SERPINE1. As shown in representative blots and summary results, the expression of NOS3 and SOD2 showed an increasing trend in SU/Hx/Nx as compared to SU/Nx G6PDS188F rats (Fig. 4, F and G), while expression of SERPINE1 showed increasing trend in SU/Hx/Nx as compared with SU/Nx WT and G6PDS188F rats (Fig. 4, F and G). Interestingly, expression of NOS3 increased in lungs of SU/Hx/Nx-G6PDS188F rats as compared to SU/Hx/Nx-WT rats (Fig. 4G). Due to the lack of a specific antibody against rat ABRA, we performed Westerns with antibodies against human and mouse species, but ABRA signals were undetectable (data not shown). Because DNMT expression and activity increased in SU/Hx/Nx-WT rats, we speculated this will alter or modify expression of several other genes and proteins, in addition to NOS3 and SOD2, in the lungs. Using quantitative MS, we detected pulmonary expression of 2300 proteins in rat lungs (Table S1). Pulmonary expression of proteins involved in glycolysis (ALDOA and IDH3B), Ca2+ handling (ITPR2), Gq receptor signaling (ARRB1), solute transporter (SLC44A2), and the complement cascade protein (C9) was higher in SU/Hx/Nx than SU/Nx WT rats but not G6PDS188F rats (Table 2). By contrast, pulmonary expression of proteins involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (ACCA2 and ATP5F1A), PKA signaling (PRKAR1A), Ca2+ handling (SERCA2/ATP2A2 and CACNA2D1), inhibition of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (SERPINA1 and SERINA3K), differentiation of SMC phenotype (CSRP1), and gene transcription (NPM1 and SART1) were all lower in SU/Hx/Nx than SU/Nx WT rats but not G6PDS188F rats (Table 2).

Open table in a new tab Mean ± SEM; N = 4 in each group. Next, in quantitative MS-proteomic analysis (Table S1), we found expression of linker histone1H1A (H1.1) and histone1H1E (H1.4), which binds DNMT1 and DNMT3B and reduces methylation of genes (19Kalashnikova A.A. Rogge R.A. Hansen J.C. Linker histone H1 and protein-protein interactions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1859: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), respectively, increased and decreased, in SU/Hx/Nx than SU/Nx G6PDS188F rats (Fig. 5A). Histone1H1A and histone1H1E showed decreasing trends in SU/Hx/Nx than SU/Nx WT rats (Fig. 5A). Because it was recently proposed that posttranslation histone modification (acetylation and methylation) contributes to gene regulation and to the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (20Hu C.J. Zhang H. Laux A. Pullamsetti S.S. Stenmark K.R. Mechanisms contributing to persistently activated cell phenotypes in pulmonary hypertension.J. Physiol. 2019; 597: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we speculated that histone modifications occur in the lungs of SU/Hx/Nx rats. Using MS, we detected acetylation and methylation of H3 variant (H3.1) at K24 and K80 (Fig. 5, B and C) and Tables S2 and S3. Interestingly, posttranslation modification spectrum counts of H3.1-K24ac and H3.1-K80me were higher (p < 0.05) in the lungs of SU/Hx/Nx compared to SU/Nx G6PDS188F but not WT rats (Fig. 5D). While there was a decreasing trend in posttranslation modification spectrum counts between SU/Nx G6PDS188F and WT rats (Fig. 5D). Thus, acetylation and methylation of histones was increased in SU/Hx/Nx G6PDS188F rats. As in previous studies (6Abe K. Toba M. Alzoubi A. Ito M. Fagan K.A. Cool C.D. et al.Formation of plexiform lesions in experimental severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.Circulation. 2010; 121: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 21Jiang B. Deng Y. Suen C. Taha M. Chaudhary K.R. Courtman D.W. et al.Marked strain-specific differences in the SU5416 rat model of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2016; 54: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), exposing WT rats to SU/Hx/Nx, as illustrated in the schematic in Figure 6A, increased RV systolic pressure (RVSP) by 69.9% (p < 0.05; Fig. 6B), RV end diastolic pressure (RVDP) by 52.1% (p < 0.05; Fig. 6C), and RV hypertrophy by 32.2% (p < 0.05; Fig. 6D). Next, we determined whether G6PD contributes to increase RV pressure and hypertrophy. In G6PDS188F rats, SU/Hx/Nx raised RVSP by 25.1% (p < 0.05). Intriguingly, RVSP increased (44.8%) more in WT than G6PDS188F rats. Moreover, while SU/Hx/Nx did not increase RVDP (Fig. 6C) or RV hypertrophy (Fig. 6D) as compared to SU/Nx in G6PDS188F rats, it significantly increased (p < 0.05) in WT rats. The effects of SU/Hx/Nx on RVDP and RV hypertrophy were significantly greater in WT than G6PDS188F rats. Evidence that alteration of DNA and histone methylation or acetylation (epigenetic modifications) associate with the development of PH has started to accumulate (22Napoli C. Benincasa G. Loscalzo J. Epigenetic inheritance underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2019; 39: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been proposed, for example, that altered methylation and acetylation marks on histones produce a persistent inflammatory phenotype in fibroblasts and an apoptosis-resistant and hyperproliferative phenotype of endothelial cells and SMCs from hypertensive patients and animal models (20Hu C.J. Zhang H. Laux A. Pullamsetti S.S. Stenmark K.R. Mechanisms contributing to persistently activated cell phenotypes in pulmonary hypertension.J. Physiol. 2019; 597: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, detailed information regarding the role of DNA methylation and aberrant gene/protein expression on the development and progression of PH remains to be determined. Because methyltransferases and demethylases regulate the level of DNA and histone methylation and can thus alter gene transcription (1Peixoto P. Cartron P.F. Serandour A.A. Hervouet E.

https://openalex.org/W4308942371,"Background Evidence for the trends and patterns of disease burden in North Korea is limited, and in-depth analysis based on several health outcomes for a better understanding remains challenging. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the trends and patterns of disease burden in North Korea between 1990 and 2019. Methods We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2019 study to analyze the North Korean disease burden in comparison with four groups: global, South Korea, low-sociodemographic index (SDI) countries, Central and Eastern Europe, and Central Asia (former socialist countries). We also examined changes in the disease burden between 1990 and 2019 by disease category and age group. Findings In 2019, in North Korea, death rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates were reduced by 22.2% and 30.7%, respectively, compared to 1990. The rates showed similar trends and patterns to that in former socialist countries. However, these reductions were lower than those of the global rates and rates in low-SDI countries and South Korea. Death rates and DALY rates for under five years dramatically decreased by more than 78%, similar to the trend in South Korea. In contrast, the decline in the death rates and DALY rates of adults was less than those worldwide and in low-SDI countries and South Korea. The burden of diseases among those aged ≥30 years increased largely due to the persistently high burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and chronic respiratory diseases were the leading causes of the disease burden in both 1990 and 2019. Interpretation North Korea’s disease burden patterns and trends show clear improvements over the past 30 years but suggest that the current challenges of NCDs in the country are very serious. NCDs should be no longer neglected and should be prioritized in public health agendas in North Korea."
https://openalex.org/W4308965146,"Humans display astonishing skill in learning about the environment in which they operate. They assimilate a rich set of affordances and interrelations among different elements in particular contexts, and form flexible abstractions (i.e., concepts) that can be generalised and leveraged with ease. To capture these abilities, we present a deep hierarchical Active Inference model of goal-directed behaviour, and the accompanying belief update schemes implied by maximising model evidence. Using simulations, we elucidate the potential mechanisms that underlie and influence concept learning in a spatial foraging task. We show that the representations formed–as a result of foraging–reflect environmental structure in a way that is enhanced and nuanced by Bayesian model reduction, a special case of structure learning that typifies learning in the absence of new evidence. Synthetic agents learn associations and form concepts about environmental context and configuration as a result of inferential, parametric learning, and structure learning processes–three processes that can produce a diversity of beliefs and belief structures. Furthermore, the ensuing representations reflect symmetries for environments with identical configurations."
https://openalex.org/W4308993308,"While current global agriculture allows for efficient food production, it brings environmental disadvantages, which resulted in a lack of public acceptance. Digital technologies (e.g., technologies that enable precision agriculture) have been suggested as a potential solution to reconcile environmental sustainability and yield increases. By embedding digital technologies into holistic farming system visualized through mission statements, this study tests the effect of different intensities of digitization, as well as environmental arguments on the willingness to buy food produced by farms in Germany. We use a 4 x 4 repeated measure experimental design surveying a representative sample of 2,020 German citizens recruited online. Our research framework captures the farming system (comparing low intensity of digitalization for a small or organic farm and low, medium, and high intensity of digitalization for large or conventional farms) and environmental arguments (comparing no arguments, and altruistic, egoistic, and biospheric arguments). The results show a negative effect of digital technologies on willingness to buy. However, this relationship turns positive when introducing environmental arguments. Furthermore, there is a moderation effect for respondents' attitudes towards technologies that varies depending on whether altruistic, egoistic, or biospheric concerns were stated. The results indicate that digital technologies can increase willingness to buy products from both large and conventional farms, but not to the level of small farms and organic farms."
https://openalex.org/W4308993319,"The diagnosis of neurological diseases is one of the biggest challenges in modern medicine, which is a major issue at the moment. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is usually used to identify various neurological diseases. EEG produces a large volume of multi-channel time-series data that neurologists visually analyze to identify and understand abnormalities within the brain and how they propagate. This is a time-consuming, error-prone, subjective, and exhausting process. Moreover, recent advances in EEG classification have mostly focused on classifying patients of a specific disease from healthy subjects using EEG data, which is not cost effective as it requires multiple systems for checking a subject’s EEG data for different neurological disorders. This forces researchers to advance their work and create a single, unified classification framework for identifying various neurological diseases from EEG signal data. Hence, this study aims to meet this requirement by developing a machine learning (ML) based data mining technique for categorizing multiple abnormalities from EEG data. Textural feature extractors and ML-based classifiers are used on time-frequency spectrogram images to develop the classification system. Initially, noises and artifacts are removed from the signal using filtering techniques and then normalized to reduce computational complexity. Afterwards, normalized signals are segmented into small time segments and spectrogram images are generated from those segments using short-time Fourier transform. Then two histogram based textural feature extractors are used to calculate features separately and principal component analysis is used to select significant features from the extracted features. Finally, four different ML based classifiers are used to categorize those selected features into different disease classes. The developed method is tested on four real-time EEG datasets. The obtained result has shown potential in classifying various abnormality types, indicating that it can be utilized to identify various neurological abnormalities from brain signal data."
https://openalex.org/W4308993470,"Low temperature and sodium butyrate (NaBu) are two of the most used productivity-enhancing strategies in CHO cell cultures during biopharmaceutical manufacturing. While these two approaches alter the balance in the reciprocal relationship between cell growth and productivity, we do not fully understand their mechanisms of action beyond a gross cell growth inhibition. Here, we used continuous culture to evaluate the differential effect of low temperature and NaBu supplementation on CHO cell performance and gene expression profile. We found that an increase in cell-productivity under growth-inhibiting conditions was associated with the arrest of cells in the G1/G0 phase. A transcriptome analysis revealed that the molecular mechanisms by which low temperature and NaBu arrested cell cycle in G1/G0 differed from each other through the deregulation of different cell cycle checkpoints and regulators. The individual transcriptome changes in pattern observed in response to low temperature and NaBu were retained when these two strategies were combined, leading to an additive effect in arresting the cell cycle in G1/G0 phase. The findings presented here offer novel molecular insights about the cell cycle regulation during the CHO cell bioprocessing and its implications for increased recombinant protein production. This data provides a background for engineering productivity-enhanced CHO cell lines for continuous manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W4309070560,"Background Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated a survival benefit for adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after resection of locoregional non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The relative benefits and harms and optimal approach to treatment for NSCLC patients who have major comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], coronary artery disease [CAD], and congestive heart failure [CHF]) are unclear, however. Methods We used a simulation model to run in-silico comparative trials of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation in locoregional NSCLC in patients with comorbidities. The model estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by each treatment strategy stratified by age, comorbidity, and stage. The model was parameterized using outcomes and quality-of-life data from RCTs and primary analyses from large cancer databases. Results Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with clinically significant QALY gains for all patient age/stage combinations with COPD except for patients &gt;80 years old with Stage IB and IIA cancers. For patients with CHF and Stage IB and IIA disease, adjuvant chemotherapy was not advantageous; in contrast, it was associated with QALY gains for more advanced stages for younger patients with CHF. For stages IIB and IIIA NSCLC, most patient groups benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy. However, In general, patients with multiple comorbidities benefited less from adjuvant chemotherapy than those with single comorbidities and women with comorbidities in older age categories benefited more from adjuvant chemotherapy than their male counterparts. Conclusions Older, multimorbid patients may derive QALY gains from adjuvant chemotherapy after NSCLC surgery. These results help extend existing clinical trial data to specific unstudied, high-risk populations and may reduce the uncertainty regarding adjuvant chemotherapy use in these patients."

This catalytic reaction is the rate-limiting step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also called citric acid or Krebs cycle), which is an essential metabolic pathway for carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Thus, NAD-IDHs play an important role in cell growth and development. In most eukaryotes, NAD-IDHs exist and function as hetero-oligomers, which share a similar catalytic mechanism but distinct regulatory mechanisms in different species. In lower eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NAD-IDH is composed of a regulatory subunit ScIDH1 and a catalytic subunit ScIDH2 in a 1:1 ratio, which share a sequence identity of 41.6% (1Cupp J.R.

For human IDH3 (HsIDH3), the pairwise sequence identities between α and β, α and γ, and β and γ are 44.6%, 43.6%, and 51.9%, respectively (Fig. S1A). The function of IDH3 also requires proper assembly of component subunits. The α, β, and γ subunits form the αβ and αγ heterodimers, which assemble into the αβαγ heterotetramer and further into the (αβαγ)2 heterooctamer (8Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.

Early biochemical studies of mammalian IDH3s showed that the α subunit is catalytic subunit while the β and γ subunits are regulatory subunits (9Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W.

Molecular mechanism of the dual regulatory roles of ATP on the αγ heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We found that in both αβ and αγ heterodimers, the α subunit possesses catalytic activity; but, only the γ subunit plays a regulatory role in an allosteric manner, while the β subunit plays a structural role to facilitate the assembly of the holoenzyme (18Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Liu Y. Ding J. The β and γ subunits play distinct functional roles in the α2βγ heterotetramer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 41882Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the absence of activators, both αβ and αγ heterodimers exhibit weak catalytic activity (basal activity). The αγ heterodimer can be activated by CIT and ADP, whereas the αβ heterodimer cannot be activated (18Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Liu Y. Ding J.

The crystal structures of the αγ and αβ heterodimers revealed the underlying molecular mechanisms (19Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Ding J.

Molecular mechanism of the dual regulatory roles of ATP on the αγ heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Specifically, the γ subunit contains an allosteric site that can bind CIT and ADP (19Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Ding J. Molecular mechanism of the allosteric regulation of the αγ heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40921Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The binding of CIT and ADP induces conformational changes of the γ subunit, which remodel hydrogen-bonding network at the α-γ interface and induce conformational changes of the active site to adopt an active conformation favorable for substrate (ICT) binding, leading to the activation of the αγ heterodimer (19Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Ding J. Molecular mechanism of the allosteric regulation of the αγ heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40921Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the β subunit contains a pseudo-allosteric site, which is structurally unable to bind CIT or ADP, and thus the αβ heterodimer cannot be allosterically activated (21Sun P. Ma T. Zhang T. Zhu H. Zhang J. Liu Y. et al.Molecular basis for the function of the αβ heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 16214-16227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, we also solved the crystal structure of the HsIDH3 holoenzyme in unliganded form, which revealed the assembly of the (αβαγ)2 heterooctamer (Fig. S1B) (23Sun P. Liu Y. Ma T. Ding J. Structure and allosteric regulation of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Specifically, the α, β, and γ subunits all consist of a large domain, a small domain, and a clasp domain. The α and β subunits form the αβ heterodimer and the α and γ subunits form the αγ heterodimer. The αβ and αγ heterodimers assemble into the αβαγ heterotetramer via their clasp domains, and two heterotetramers further assemble into the (αβαγ)2 heterooctamer with the N terminus of the γ subunit of one heterotetramer inserted into the β subunit of the other heterotetramer (Fig. S1B) (23Sun P. Liu Y. Ma T. Ding J. Structure and allosteric regulation of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the (αβαγ)2 heterooctamer, the two heterotetramers are arranged in perpendicular to each other with a tetrahedron architecture; the two β and two γ subunits are arranged alternately to form the inner core, and the four α subunits are positioned on the periphery (Fig. S1B). In this structure, both αγ and αβ heterodimers adopt inactive conformations and thus the holoenzyme assumes an inactive conformation. Interestingly, in both the absence and presence of the activators, the (αβαγ)2 holoenzyme exhibits much higher activities and tighter binding affinities for ICT than those of the isolated αβ and αγ heterodimers, suggesting that there is a synergistic effect between the αβ and αγ heterodimers in the holoenzyme (23Sun P. Liu Y. Ma T. Ding J. Structure and allosteric regulation of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was postulated that in the holoenzyme, both α subunits could be activated and the γ subunit might regulate the α subunits in both αβ and αγ heterodimers through an allosteric mechanism (18Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Liu Y. Ding J. The β and γ subunits play distinct functional roles in the α2βγ heterotetramer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 41882Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Sun P. Liu Y. Ma T. Ding J. Structure and allosteric regulation of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the allosteric activation of the holoenzyme, especially for how the activation signal would be transmitted from the γ subunit to the α subunit in the αβ heterodimer, is still unclear. To this end, we performed crystallographic studies of the HsIDH3 holoenzyme in the presence of various activators and ligands. Although we were able to grow crystals of decent sizes, unfortunately these crystals diffracted X-rays only to low resolutions (about 6–7 Å), prohibiting us from obtaining a high-resolution crystal structure of the activator-bound HsIDH3 holoenzyme with an active conformation. Meanwhile, during the examination of the functional roles of numerous key residues in the activation of the HsIDH3 holoenzyme, we found that intriguingly, the mutant holoenzymes containing the Q139A mutation in the clasp domain of the α subunit (αQ139A or αM), namely the (αMβαγ)2, (αβαMγ)2, and (αMβαMγ)2 holoenzymes, are all constitutively active (23Sun P. Liu Y. Ma T. Ding J. Structure and allosteric regulation of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). α-Gln139 is involved in the intersubunit hydrogen-bonding interactions in the structures of the isolated αβ and αγ heterodimers and the unliganded (αβαγ)2 holoenzyme (19Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Ding J. Molecular mechanism of the allosteric regulation of the αγ heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40921Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Sun P. Ma T. Zhang T. Zhu H. Zhang J.

Structure and allosteric regulation of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The hydrogen-bonding network at the α-γ interface and the αγ-αγ interface is remodeled during the activation of the αγ heterodimer (19Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Ding J. Molecular mechanism of the allosteric regulation of the αγ heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40921Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to speculate that α-Gln139 might play an important role in the allosteric activation of the HsIDH3 holoenzyme. In this work, we carried out biochemical and structural studies of the αMβ, αMγ, and αMβαMγ mutant enzymes. We found that like the αM-containing holoenzymes, the αMβ and αMγ heterodimers are also constitutively active. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we determined the crystal structures of the αMβ and αMγ heterodimers in both unliganded and ligand-bound forms and a moderate-resolution crystal structure of the (αMβαMγ)2 holoenzyme in unliganded form. Structural analysis shows that consistent with the biochemical data, the structures of both αMβ and αMγ heterodimers assume active conformations regardless the absence or presence of activators. In addition, the structure of the (αMβαMγ)2 holoenzyme also assumes an active conformation as indicated by the conformations of several key structure elements, despite the absence of activators. The α-Q139A mutation alters the hydrogen-bonding network at the heterodimer-heterodimer interface in a similar manner as that in the activation of the αγ heterodimer, which not only stabilizes the active sites of both αMβ and αMγ heterodimers in active conformations but also induces conformational changes of the pseudo-allosteric site of the αMβ heterodimer enabling it to bind activators. Moreover, the crystal structure of αMICT+Ca+NADβNAD presents the first pseudo-Michaelis complex for HsIDH3 and other NAD-IDHs, which allows us to identify the key residues involved in the binding of cofactor, substrate, and metal ion. Our structural and biochemical data together reveal new insights into the molecular mechanisms for the allosteric activation and the catalytic reaction of HsIDH3. These findings provide the guidance for further study of the structure and function relationship and allosteric regulation mechanism of other mammalian IDH3 and allosterically regulated enzymes, as well as the molecular basis and technical tool for further investigation of the functional roles of disease-associated mutations and/or dysregulation of the component subunits of HsIDH3 in the pathogenesis of relevant diseases. Our previous biochemical data showed that the WT αβ and αγ heterodimers and (αβαγ)2 holoenzyme exhibit low Vmax (the maximal velocity of the enzymatic reaction) and high S0.5 for ICT (S0.5,ICT; the substrate concentration at half-maximum velocity, which approximates the apparent Michaelis constant Km) in the absence of activators (basal activity) (Table 1 and Fig. S2) (18Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Liu Y. Ding J. The β and γ subunits play distinct functional roles in the α2βγ heterotetramer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci.

Chem. 2019; 294: 16214-16227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the presence of CIT and ADP, the activities of the WT αγ and (αβαγ)2 are potentiated by 20.8-fold and 8.2-fold (defined as the ratio of S0.5,ICT (−activators)/S0.5,ICT (+activators)), respectively, which are manifested by moderately increased Vmax and significantly decreased S0.5,ICT. In contrast, the WT αβ heterodimer shows unchanged Vmax and S0.5,ICT in the absence and presence of activators, indicating that it could not be activated. Intriguingly, all of the (αMβαγ)2, (αβαMγ)2, and (αMβαMγ)2 mutant holoenzymes are constitutively active in the absence of activators. To investigate the functional role of the α-Q139A mutation in the activation of these mutant holoenzymes, we expressed and purified the αMβ and αMγ heterodimers and measured their kinetic parameters in the absence and presence of activators (CIT and ADP). The results show that in the absence of activators, both αMβ and αMγ heterodimers exhibit significantly higher Vmax and lower S0.5,ICT compared to those of the WT αβ and αγ heterodimers (Table 1 and Fig. S2). Specifically, αMβ shows a Vmax of 18.0 ± 1.4 μmol∙min−1 mg−1 and a S0.5,ICT of 0.17 ± 0.02 mM, and αMγ shows a Vmax of 25.5 ± 2.3 μmol∙min−1 mg−1 and a S0.5,ICT of 0.26 ± 0.11 mM. Notably, the binding affinities of αMβ and αMγ for ICT (reflected by S0.5,ICT) in the absence of activators are comparable to those of WT αγ in the presence of activators (p values > 0.09) (Fig. S2D). Addition of the activators confers only slight activation effect (1.7–2.0-fold) for the mutant heterodimers. These results indicate that like the mutant holoenzymes, the αMβ and αMγ heterodimers are constitutively active regardless the absence or presence of activators.Table 1Kinetic parameters of the WT and mutant HsIDH3aKinetic parameters of the WT and α-Q139A (αM) containing mutants of αβ, αγ, and (αβαγ)2 in the absence and presence of activators (ADP and CIT) are determined.

Open table in a new tab Moreover, the size-exclusion chromatography–multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis shows that similar to the WT holoenzyme, the mutant holoenzyme displays an average mass of approximately 290 kDa at both low concentration (1 mg/ml) and high concentration (10 mg/ml) corresponding to an (αMβαMγ)2 heterooctamer (Fig. 1). In contrast to the WT αβ and αγ heterodimers, both of which exist as heterodimers (75 kDa) at low concentration and a dimer of heterodimers or heterotetramer [(αβ)2 and (αγ)2] (130 kDa) at high concentration (18Ma T. Peng Y. Huang W. Liu Y. Ding J. The β and γ subunits play distinct functional roles in the α2βγ heterotetramer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 41882Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the mutant heterodimers exhibit an average molecular mass of approximately 131 to 149 kDa at both low and high concentrations, corresponding to a heterotetramer [(αMβ)2 and (αMγ)2] (Fig. 1). In addition, the thermal shift assay (TSA) analysis shows that the melting temperatures (Tm) of αMβ and αMγ at low concentration (1 mg/ml) are ∼5 °C higher than that of WT αβ and αγ, indicating that αMβ and αMγ are more stable than WT αβ and αγ (Fig. S3). These results indicate that the α-Q139A mutation stabilizes the heterotetrameric forms of αMβ and αMγ. To understand the molecular basis for the functional role of the α-Q139A mutation in the constitutive activation and stabilization of the heterotetrameric forms of αMγ and αMβ, we determined the crystal structures of αMγ in apo form (αMγ) and a ligand-bound form (αMγCIT) and αMβ in apo form (αMβ) and two ligand-bound forms (αMICT+Ca+NADβNAD and αMMgβADP) (Table 2).

https://openalex.org/W4309108122,"Inappropriate and injudicious use of antimicrobials in broiler and layer farms has become a common practice in lower and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. This study aimed to assess poultry farmers' knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding antimicrobial usage (AMU), and their beliefs in factors that affect antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread and emergence in humans through commercial poultry farms in Bangladesh.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 204 farmers (95.6% male; meanage = 35.14 ± 10.25 years) in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh who were recruited from three upazilas (sub-districts) through a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected from June to November 2021 via face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire.The proportion of farmers who reported having received information regarding AMU from veterinarians was higher in layer compared to broiler farms (65.9% vs. 44.9%, p &lt; 0.001). A higher proportion of layer compared to broiler farmers believed that antimicrobial residues and pathogens in poultry can pass to humans through the consumption of contaminated eggs (28.1% vs. 5.8%, p &lt; 0.05). The mean score of the farmers' attitude towards addressing AMU was 4.49 (SD = 1.37) out of 7, with the higher score indicating a better attitude. The mean score of better attitudes towards addressing AMU was significantly higher among educated participants (bachelor's or higher levels of education (p = 0.006). A higher proportion of layer (56.3%) farmers did not keep a record of AMU when compared to broiler farmers (37.7%) (p = 0.012). More broiler (50.7%) compared to layer (38.5%) farmers continued using the full dose of antimicrobials (p = 0.042). The most frequently used antimicrobials in broiler and layer poultry farms were Colistin (broiler vs layer: 73.9% vs. 86.75%; p = 0.024), and Ciprofloxacin (broiler vs. layer: 95.7% vs. 84.4%; p = 0.021). Farmers' beliefs were significantly associated with the spread of AMR pathogens from contaminated eggs to humans (p &lt; 0.001).The findings reflected that majority of farmers had inadequate knowledge of AMU, less knowledgeable beliefs aboutAMU, and inappropriate AMU (e.g., poor record keeping, incomplete doses) in chicken production systems. The government should ensure education or advisory services for poultry farmers on proper AMU, enforce current veterinary laws and regulations on antimicrobials, and implement AMU surveillance systems."

https://openalex.org/W4308964294,"Background The number of complications after total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is high and survival rates are low compared to hip and knee arthroplasties. The most common reason for revision is aseptic loosening, which might be caused by overloading of the elbow. In an attempt to lower failure rates, current clinical practice is to restrict activities for patients with a TEA. However, postoperative management of TEA is a poorly investigated topic, as no evidence-based clinical guidelines exist and the aftercare is often surgeon-based. In this study we evaluated the current postoperative management of TEA among orthopedic surgeons. Methods An online survey of 30 questions was sent to 635 members of the European Society for Surgery of the Shoulder and the Elbow (SECEC/ESSSE), about 10% (n = ± 64) of whom are considered dedicated elbow specialists. The questions were on characteristics of the surgeon and on the surgeon’s preferred postoperative management, including items to be assessed on length of immobilization, amount of weight bearing and axial loading, instructions on lifelong activities, physiotherapy, and postoperative evaluation of the elbow. Results The survey was completed by 54 dedicated elbow specialists from 17 different countries. Postoperative immobilization of the elbow was advised by half of respondents when using the triceps-sparing approach (52%), and even more with the triceps-detaching approach (65%). Postoperative passive movement of the elbow was allowed in the triceps-sparing approach (91%) and in the triceps-detaching approach (87%). Most respondents gave recommendations on weight bearing (91%) or axial loading (76%) by the affected elbow, but the specification shows significant variation. Conclusion The results from this survey demonstrate a wide variation in postoperative care of TEA. The lack of consensus in combination with low survival rates stresses the need for clinical guidelines. Further research should focus on creating these guidelines to improve follow-up care for TEA."
https://openalex.org/W4308964424,"Background and aims So far, few clinical trials are available concerning the role of growth hormone receptor (GHR)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)/insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis in hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hepatic expression of GHR/STAT5/IGF-1 signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and to correlate the results with the clinico-pathological features and disease outcome. The interaction between this signaling pathway and some inducers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), namely Snail-1 and type 2 transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR2) was studied too. Material and methods A total of 40 patients with HCV-associated HCC were included in this study. They were compared to 40 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis without HCC, and 20 healthy controls. The hepatic expression of GHR, STAT5, IGF-1, Snail-1 and TGFBR2 proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results Compared with cirrhotic patients without HCC and healthy controls, cirrhotic patients with HCC had significantly lower hepatic expression of GHR, STAT5, and IGF-1proteins. They also displayed significantly lower hepatic expression of TGFBR2, but higher expression of Snail-1 versus the non-HCC cirrhotic patients and controls. Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) showed significant negative correlations with hepatic expression of GHR (r = -0.31; p = 0.029) and STAT5 (r = -0.29; p = 0.04). Hepatic expression of Snail-1 also showed negative correlations with GHR, STAT5, and IGF-1 expression (r = -0.55, p = 0.02; r = -0.472, p = 0.035, and r = -0.51, p = 0.009, respectively), whereas, hepatic expression of TGFBR2 was correlated positively with the expression of all these proteins (r = 0.47, p = 0.034; 0.49, p = 0.023, and r = 0.57, p&lt;0.001, respectively). Moreover, we reported that decreased expression of GHR was significantly associated with serum AFP level&gt;100 ng/ml (p = 0.048), increased tumor size (p = 0.02), vascular invasion (p = 0.002), and advanced pathological stage (p = 0.01). Similar significant associations were found between down-regulation of STAT5 expression and AFP level &gt; 100 ng/ml (p = 0.006), vascular invasion (p = 0.009), and advanced tumor stage (p = 0.007). Also, attenuated expression of IGF-1 showed a significant association with vascular invasion (p &lt; 0.001). Intriguingly, we detected that lower expression of GHR, STAT5 and IGF-1 were considered independent predictors for worse outcome in HCC. Conclusion Decreased expression of GHR/STAT5/IGF-1 signaling pathway may have a role in development, aggressiveness, and worse outcome of HCV-associated HCC irrespective of the liver functional status. Snail-1 and TGFBR2 as inducers of EMT may be key players. However, large prospective multicenter studies are needed to validate these results."

https://openalex.org/W4308965204,"Numerous single gene mutations identified in humans and mice result in nail deformities with many similarities between the species. A spontaneous, autosomal, recessive mutation called witch nails ( whnl ) is described here where the distal nail matrix and nail bed undergo degenerative changes resulting in formation of an abnormal nail plate causing mice to develop long, curved nails. This mutation arose spontaneously in a colony of MRL/MpJ- Fas lpr /J at The Jackson Laboratory. Homozygous mutant mice are recognizable by 8 weeks of age by their long, curved nails. The whnl mutation, mapped on Chromosome 15, is due to a 7-bp insertion identified in the 3’ region of exon 9 in the Krt90 gene (formerly Riken cDNA 4732456N10Rik ), and is predicted to result in a frameshift that changes serine 476 to arginine and subsequently introduces 36 novel amino acids into the protein before a premature stop codon (p. Ser476ArgfsTer36). By immunohistochemistry the normal KRT90 protein is expressed in the nail matrix and nail bed in control mice where lesions are located in mutant mice. Immunoreactivity toward equine KRT124, the ortholog of mouse KRT90, is restricted to the hoof lamellae (equine hoof wall and lamellae are homologous to the mouse nail plate and nail bed) and the mouse nail bed. Equine laminitis lesions are similar to those observed in this mutant mouse suggesting that the latter may be a useful model for hoof and nail diseases. This first spontaneous mouse mutation affecting the novel Krt90 gene provides new insight into the normal regulation of the molecular pathways of nail development."
https://openalex.org/W4308966212,"By applying an explorative approach, we aimed to identify a wide set of challenges and opportunities for the compatibility of the work and life domains in emergency department (ED) physicians as well as their suggestions for practical approaches to improve work-life balance. Four focus groups with 14 physicians of differing hierarchical position and family status were carried out at two EDs of one major university hospital. Data analysis was based on qualitative content analysis. Discussed themes within main categories included ED work conditions, aspects of residency training, physician's mentality and behaviors as well as context factors of university medicine. Working in an ED is associated with a comparatively high work-life-interference, mostly due to the unpredictable nature of ED work. Based on our context-specific findings, further research might address factors influencing work-life balance in ED physicians with a mixed-methods approach for identification of relevant associations and intervention approaches in this field."
https://openalex.org/W4308992416,"Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC. ( A . lancea : AL) is a promising candidate for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). The study investigated (i) the propensity of capsule formulation of the standardized extract of AL (formulated AL) to modulate mRNA and protein expression and activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 in rats after long- and short-term exposure, (ii) the pharmacokinetics of atractylodin (ATD: active constituent) after long-term administration of formulated AL, and (iii) the biodistribution of atractylodin-loaded polylactic-co-glycolic acid (ATD-PLGA-NPs) in mice. To investigate CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 modulatory activities following long-term exposure, rats of both genders received oral doses of the formulated AL at 1,000 (low dose), 3,000 (medium dose), and 5,000 (high dose) mg/kg body weight daily for 12 months. For short-term effects, male rats were orally administered the formulated AL at the dose of 5,000 mg/kg body weight daily for 1, 7, 14 and 21 days. The pharmacokinetic study was conducted in male rats after administration of the formulated AL at the dose of 5,000 mg/kg body weight daily for 9 months. The biodistribution study was conducted in a male mouse receiving ATD-PLGA-NPs at the equivalent dose to ATD of 100 mg/kg body weight. The high dose of formulated AL produced an inducing effect on CYP1A2 but an inhibitory effect on CYP3A1 activities in male rats. The low dose, however, did not inhibit or induce the activities of both enzymes in male and female rats. ATD reached maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of 359.73 ng/mL at 3 h (t max ). Mean residence time (MRT) and terminal phase elimination half-life (t 1/2z ) were 3.03 and 0.56 h, respectively. The extent of biodistribution of ATD in mouse livers receiving ATD-PLGA-NPs was 5-fold of that receiving free ATD. Clinical use of low-dose AL should be considered to avoid potential herb-drug interactions after long-term use. ATD-PLGA-NPs is a potential drug delivery system for cholangiocarcinoma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4308993382,"Background Type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major risk factor for cognitive impairment. Protecting the brain environment against inflammation, and neurodegeneration, as well as preservation of the BBB veracity through modulating the crosstalk between insulin/AKT/GSK-3β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, might introduce novel therapeutic targets. Purpose This study aimed at exploring the possible neuroprotective potential of vitamin D3 (VitD) and/or rosuvastatin (RSV) in T2DM-induced cognitive deficits. Methods T2DM was induced by a high-fat sucrose diet and a single streptozotocin (STZ) dose. Diabetic rats were allocated into a diabetic control and three groups treated with RSV (15 mg/kg/day, PO), VitD (500 IU/kg/day, PO), or their combination. Results Administration of VitD and/or RSV mitigated T2DM-induced metabolic abnormalities and restored the balance between the anti-inflammatory, IL 27 and the proinflammatory, IL 23 levels in the hippocampus. In addition, they markedly activated both the canonical and noncanonical Wnt/β-catenin cassettes with stimulation of their downstream molecular targets. VitD and/or RSV upregulated insulin and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors gene expression, as well as blood-brain barrier integrity markers including Annexin A1, claudin 3, and VE-cadherin. Also, they obliterated hippocampal ApoE-4 content, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and Aβ deposition. These biochemical changes were reflected as improved behavioral performance in Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests and restored hippocampal histological profile. Conclusion The current findings have accentuated the neuroprotective potential of VitD and RSV and provide new incentives to expand their use in T2DM-induced cognitive and memory decline. This study also suggests a superior benefit of combining both treatments over either drug alone."

The clinical indications for and impact of 18 F-FDG PET/CT on diagnostic and antimicrobial management were evaluated across different infectious indications. Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common indication was identifying a source of a known infection (46%), followed by fever of unknown etiology (FUE)/fever of unknown origin (FUO) (38%), and other (16%). 18 F-FDG PET/CT was determined to have had a diagnostic or management clinical impact for a total of 22 patients (36%) including 12/28 (43%) of patients with known infection, 7/23 (30%) of patients with FUE/FUO, and 3/10 (30%) of patients with other indications. 18 F-FDG PET/CT confirmed suspected prosthetic endovascular infection for 6/16 (38%) patients. In this study, 18 F-FDG PET/CT led to a clinical impact on diagnostic and treatment management of hospitalized patients across a variety of syndromes and particularly for source identification in the setting of known infection."

In the context of chemistry education, this project has investigated how an adaptive learning technology can effectively and consistently engage students in discipline specific thinking, by personalising their learning pathway. Adaptive learning has been integrated into a foundational chemistry subject and through quantitative analysis there is empirical evidence to support the benefit adaptive learning has on outcomes, in both the short and long term. This study shows adaptive learning can equitably meet the needs for all students and can lead to improvements in educational behaviour beyond grades. The evidence supports adaptive learning as one critical tool for chemistry educators, and educators in other disciplines of science, to include in their suite of pedagogical strategies to meet the needs of all their students."
https://openalex.org/W4307723224,"Numerous studies have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and cardio-protective activities of dietary polyphenols, but due to diverse structures and subclasses of polyphenols, little is known about their mechanisms of action. The study by Yamaguchi et al. published in JBC provides mechanistic insights into how dietary polyphenols confer histone-binding ability on certain proteins and motivates the research community to further explore health benefits of polyphenols. Numerous studies have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and cardio-protective activities of dietary polyphenols, but due to diverse structures and subclasses of polyphenols, little is known about their mechanisms of action. The study by Yamaguchi et al. published in JBC provides mechanistic insights into how dietary polyphenols confer histone-binding ability on certain proteins and motivates the research community to further explore health benefits of polyphenols. Polyphenols constitute a large family of organic compounds containing one or more hydroxylated aromatic rings. Produced by plants as metabolites, polyphenols are abundantly present in fruit, vegetables, tea, herbs, and wine, essentially accounting for their flavor and color and often for their pharmacological properties. Polyphenols have been extensively studied as natural therapeutic tools beneficial in preventing various human diseases and ailments, but they have also been found to impact disease progression and even exhibit curative properties (1Wan M.L.Y. Co V.A. El-Nezami H. Dietary polyphenol impact on gut health and microbiota.Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 2021; 61: 690-711Google Scholar, 2Brglez Mojzer E. Knez Hrncic M. Skerget M. Knez Z. Bren U. Polyphenols: extraction methods, antioxidative action, bioavailability and anticarcinogenic effects.Molecules. 2016; 21: 901Google Scholar). Despite recent interest in exploring the therapeutic potential of polyphenols, especially in combination with existing drugs and conventional therapies, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities remains very limited. Generally, these mechanisms relate to the antioxidative properties of polyphenols, which alter the cell signaling cascades that trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells or attenuate their adhesiveness, reducing their metastatic potential (2Brglez Mojzer E. Knez Hrncic M. Skerget M. Knez Z. Bren U. Polyphenols: extraction methods, antioxidative action, bioavailability and anticarcinogenic effects.Molecules. 2016; 21: 901Google Scholar). Through other mechanisms, polyphenols interfere with cytokine production and immune responses, modulate gut microbiota, or amend gene expression and the pattern of epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications (2Brglez Mojzer E. Knez Hrncic M. Skerget M. Knez Z. Bren U. Polyphenols: extraction methods, antioxidative action, bioavailability and anticarcinogenic effects.Molecules. 2016; 21: 901Google Scholar). Consumed polyphenols are predominantly polyglycosylated and therefore are characterized by high molecular weight and complex structures, which markedly impede their absorption and penetration of the cell membrane, thus constraining their activity largely to the extracellular space. Although histones are well recognized as DNA-binding nuclear proteins and major components of chromatin, they are also found on the surface of human blood monocytes, activated lymphocytes, leukocytes, and apoptotic cells (3Das R. Plow E.F. Phosphatidylserine as an anchor for plasminogen and its plasminogen receptor, histone H2B, to the macrophage surface.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2011; 9: 339-349Google Scholar). In addition, neutrophils release the neutrophil extracellular trap, a web-like complex of chromatin and antimicrobial proteins, into the extracellular space to fight pathogens that are too large for phagocytic uptake (4Pieterse E. Rother N. Yanginlar C. Gerretsen J. Boeltz S. Munoz L.E. et al.Cleaved N-terminal histone tails distinguish between NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent and NOX-independent pathways of neutrophil extracellular trap formation.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2018; 77: 1790-1798Google Scholar, 5Marsman G. Zeerleder S. Luken B.M. Extracellular histones, cell-free DNA, or nucleosomes: differences in immunostimulation.Cell Death Dis. 2016; 7e2518Google Scholar). Histones are even present in the blood, and their relatively low (∼2 mg/l) concentration can rise dramatically (>200-fold) in conditions such as sepsis, inflammation, or trauma (6Guo H.Y. Cui Z.J. Extracellular histones activate plasma membrane toll-like receptor 9 to trigger calcium oscillations in rat pancreatic acinar tumor cell AR4-2J.Cells. 2018; 8: 3Google Scholar). Extracellular and cell surface histones have been shown to stimulate calcium entry and cytokine release, inhibit macrophage phagocytosis, and activate Toll-like receptors to induce hepatic reperfusion and glomerular cell injuries and calcium oscillation (6Guo H.Y. Cui Z.J. Extracellular histones activate plasma membrane toll-like receptor 9 to trigger calcium oscillations in rat pancreatic acinar tumor cell AR4-2J.Cells. 2018; 8: 3Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminal histone tails, cleaved by the neutrophil elastase in neutrophil extracellular traps, function as secondary messengers, adding yet another layer of complexity in the immunological response and immune defense mechanisms (4Pieterse E. Rother N. Yanginlar C. Gerretsen J. Boeltz S. Munoz L.E. et al.Cleaved N-terminal histone tails distinguish between NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent and NOX-independent pathways of neutrophil extracellular trap formation.Ann. Rheum.

Extracellular histones, cell-free DNA, or nucleosomes: differences in immunostimulation.Cell Death Dis. 2016; 7e2518Google Scholar). Histones do not possess transmembrane or evident membrane-binding domains but can associate with the cell surface through electrostatic interactions with highly negatively charged heparin sulfate proteoglycans or with the negatively charged phosphoserine during phosphoserine exposure to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in apoptotic monocytoid cells (3Das R. Plow E.F. Phosphatidylserine as an anchor for plasminogen and its plasminogen receptor, histone H2B, to the macrophage surface.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2011; 9: 339-349Google Scholar, 7Watson K. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Edwards R.J. Nucleosomes bind to cell surface proteoglycans.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21707-21713Google Scholar). The Uchida lab has shown that cell surface histones function as receptors for AGE (advanced glycation end products) and regulate macrophage recruitment to the site of inflammation (8Itakura M. Yamaguchi K. Kitazawa R. Lim S.Y. Anan Y. Yoshitake J. et al.Histone functions as a cell-surface receptor for AGEs.Nat. Commun. 2022; 13: 2974Google Scholar). In their new study published in a recent issue of JBC, the Uchida lab reports on characterization of the mechanism by which polyphenols can modify nonhistone proteins and interact with extracellular histones (9Yamaguchi K. Itakura M. Tsukamoto M. Lim S.Y. Uchida K. Natural polyphenols convert proteins into histone-binding ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102529Google Scholar). Yamaguchi et al. (9Yamaguchi K. Itakura M. Tsukamoto M. Lim S.Y. Uchida K. Natural polyphenols convert proteins into histone-binding ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102529Google Scholar) demonstrate that proteins abundant in the blood, such as albumin, transferrin, and immunoglobulin, once modified by polyphenols, acquire the ability to bind histones. Not all polyphenols help in the developing of this ability; of 25 polyphenols tested, only seven, including (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), piceatannol, and baicalein, can do so. The authors further show that binding of the proteins modified by polyphenols to histones requires the N-terminal tails of histones, which are enriched in lysine and arginine residues and therefore are highly positively charged. Acetylation of the histone N-terminal tails eliminates this binding, indicating that unprotected (nonacetylated) lysine residues play a role in the interaction. What is the mechanism underlying these transformations? It might involve the formation of dehydrolysinonorleucine, a lysine-derived crosslink that was previously reported for piceatannol-mediated protein polymerization (10Furuhashi M. Hatasa Y. Kawamura S. Shibata T. Akagawa M. Uchida K. Identification of polyphenol-specific innate epitopes that originated from a resveratrol analogue.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 4701-4712Google Scholar) (shown in Fig. 1 in ref. (9Yamaguchi K. Itakura M. Tsukamoto M. Lim S.Y. Uchida K. Natural polyphenols convert proteins into histone-binding ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102529Google Scholar)). In the presence of oxidizing agents, many polyphenols undergo rapid oxidation into quinones, which can form the Schiff base compounds through interacting with the side-chain amino group of lysine. These compounds are further converted into a highly reactive aldehyde that reacts with the side chain amino group of another lysine to produce again a Schiff base but now connecting two lysines via their side chains. The resulting “two-lysine crosslink” couples two proteins or two parts of a protein. Indeed, formation of the reactive aldehyde from a lysine analog upon treatment with EGCG and its acquired histone-binding activity implies that the oxidized lysine pathway has a role in binding to histones (9Yamaguchi K. Itakura M. Tsukamoto M. Lim S.Y. Uchida K. Natural polyphenols convert proteins into histone-binding ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102529Google Scholar). However, the “two-lysine crosslink” was undetectable in the reaction mixture and suggested an alternative mechanism. EGCG is known to quickly oxidize and form heterogeneous polymeric structures. The authors propose that EGCG itself could serve as a linker between the tested proteins (albumin) and histones, providing a hub for the formation of large histone-bound aggregates (9Yamaguchi K. Itakura M. Tsukamoto M. Lim S.Y. Uchida K. Natural polyphenols convert proteins into histone-binding ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102529Google Scholar). The reversible nature of the binding of histones to the EGCG–protein aggregates excludes the possibility of oxidation of histone lysines and supports noncovalent interactions, which can modulate extracellular activities of both histones and polyphenol-modified nonhistone proteins. The study by Yamaguchi et al. (9Yamaguchi K. Itakura M. Tsukamoto M. Lim S.Y. Uchida K. Natural polyphenols convert proteins into histone-binding ligands.J. Biol.

These findings not only shed light on the role of polyphenols in attenuating the endothelial toxicity of histones but also highlight topics for future research regarding the oligomeric state of polyphenols and the reason as to why histones are incapable of forming stable Schiff base crosslinks. It will be exciting to see future work addressing differences in action of the structurally diverse subclasses of polyphenols that are consumed by humans with common food, including polyphenols described in the current study: EGCG, which is found in tea, fruit, and chocolate and belongs to catechins; piceatannol, present in high concentration in red wine, grapes, and peanuts and belongs to stilbenes; and baicalein, an herb-derived flavone.

Natural polyphenols convert proteins into histone-binding ligandsJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 298Issue 11PreviewAntioxidants are sensitive to oxidation and are immediately converted into their oxidized forms that can react with proteins. We have recently found that proteins incubated with oxidized vitamin C (dehydroascorbate) gain a new function as a histone-binding ligand. This finding led us to predict that antioxidants, through conversion to their oxidized forms, may generally have similar functions. In the present study, we identified several natural polyphenols as a source of histone ligands and characterized the mechanism for the interaction of protein-bound polyphenols with histone.

During an active immune response, the lymphatics remodel to accommodate the influx of immune cells from the tissue, but factors involved in remodeling are unclear. Here, we determined that a TSS motif within the cytoplasmic domain of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), expressed by LECs in the LN, participates in lymphatic remodeling. Mutation of the TSS motif to AAA does not affect surface expression of PD-L1, but instead causes defects in LN cortical and medullary lymphatic organization following immunostimulant, Poly I:C, administration in vivo. Supporting this observation, in vitro treatment of the LEC cell line, SVEC4-10, with cytokines TNFα and IFNα significantly impeded SVEC4-10 movement in the presence of the TSS-AAA cytoplasmic mutation. The cellular movement defects coincided with reduced F-actin polymerization, consistent with differences previously found in dendritic cells. Here, in addition to loss of actin polymerization, we define STAT3 and Paxillin as important PD-L1 binding partners. STAT3 and Paxillin were previously demonstrated to be important at focal adhesions for cellular motility. We further demonstrate the PD-L1 TSS-AAA motif mutation reduced the amount of pSTAT3 and Paxillin bound to PD-L1 both before and after exposure to TNFα and IFNα. Together, these findings highlight PD-L1 as an important component of a membrane complex that is involved in cellular motility, which leads to defects in lymphatic organization.

Type 1 IFN suppresses LEC division early during the immune response and cooperates with PD-L1 to regulate LEC division throughout the immune response (11Lucas E.D. Finlon J.M.

Following the brief inhibition of growth by type I IFN and PD-L1, the cortical LN lymphatics expand to accommodate the influx immune cells (2Tamburini B.A. Burchill M.A. Kedl R.M.

Activated T-cells also trigger LN lymphatic expansion, but the mechanism of this expansion is unknown (2Tamburini B.A. Burchill M.A. Kedl R.M. Antigen capture and archiving by lymphatic endothelial cells following vaccination or viral infection.Nat. Commun. 2014; 53989Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

In an in vitro culture system, LECs exposed to TNFα upregulated adhesion proteins and induced actin polymerization, resulting in longer continuous F-actin filaments (20Kakei Y. Akashi M. Shigeta T.

In the absence of inflammatory cytokines, LEC migration and proliferation in response to VEGF occurred concurrently with F-actin fiber formation (22Makinen T. Veikkola T. Mustjoki S. Karpanen T. Catimel B.

While little has been described regarding the molecular mechanisms required for the movement and reorganization of the lymphatics of the LN, the studies aforementioned suggest that F-actin fiber formation following TNFα, and likely type 1 IFN, facilitate lymphatic remodeling. In the naïve mouse, LN LECs have variable expression of PD-L1. PD-L1 is expressed at relatively high levels on floor LECs, Marco-LECs, and tzLECs (3Berendam S.J. Koeppel A.F. Godfrey N.R.

This expression of PD-L1 under normal conditions is important in maintaining tolerance to peripheral tissue antigens and preventing aberrant lymphatic proliferation (11Lucas E.D. Finlon J.M. Burchill M.A. McCarthy M.K. Morrison T.E. Colpitts T.M. et al.Type 1 IFN and PD-L1 coordinate lymphatic endothelial cell expansion and contraction during an inflammatory immune response.J.

Following a type 1 IFN inducing stimulus, all LECs upregulate PD-L1 (11Lucas E.D. Finlon J.M. Burchill M.A. McCarthy M.K. Morrison T.E.

Immunol. 2018; 201: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resulting upregulation of PD-L1 by LECs impedes cell division and improves LEC survival, a function which was lost in the absence of PD-L1 (11Lucas E.D. Finlon J.M. Burchill M.A. McCarthy M.K.

PD-L1 reverse signaling in dermal dendritic cells promotes dendritic cell migration required for skin immunity.Cell Rep. 2020; 33108258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that a specific cytoplasmic motif, threonine-serine-serine (TSS), is responsible for at least some of the defined intracellular signaling by PD-L1. The function of this motif was demonstrated by mutation of amino acids 277 to 279 TSS to alanine-alanine-alanine (AAA) (1Lucas E.D. Schafer J.B. Matsuda J. Kraus M. Burchill M.A. Tamburini B.A.J. PD-L1 reverse signaling in dermal dendritic cells promotes dendritic cell migration required for skin immunity.Cell Rep. 2020; 33108258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In DCs, the three amino acid mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1 caused defective chemokine receptor signaling, loss of ERK phosphorylation, and decreased actin polymerization (1Lucas E.D. Schafer J.B. Matsuda J. Kraus M. Burchill M.A. Tamburini B.A.J. PD-L1 reverse signaling in dermal dendritic cells promotes dendritic cell migration required for skin immunity.Cell Rep. 2020; 33108258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Loss of the TSS motif in PD-L1 led to defective chemotaxis of DCs but did not alter surface expression of PD-L1 (1Lucas E.D. Schafer J.B. Matsuda J. Kraus M. Burchill M.A. Tamburini B.A.J. PD-L1 reverse signaling in dermal dendritic cells promotes dendritic cell migration required for skin immunity.Cell Rep. 2020; 33108258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). While PD-L1 expression by LECs and consequences of loss of PD-L1 in LECs has been demonstrated, whether the TSS motif functions similar in LECs as DCs is yet unknown. Here, we demonstrate that loss of three residues within the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1 significantly impairs LN lymphatic reorganization following poly I:C injection into the footpad of mice. We produced a stable LEC line with constitutive expression of either WT Pdl1 or Pdl1 with the TSS-AAA mutation in the cytoplasmic domain (Pdl1CyMt). We observed a similar growth phenotype and expression of PD-L1 in these cells at steady state. Upon stimulation with either type 1 IFN or TNF alpha, we show a significant defect in actin polymerization and cellular movement across a wound. These phenotypic changes appear to be a result of defective intracellular interactions between PD-L1, pSTAT3, and paxillin. Interestingly, pSTAT3 and paxillin were previously reported to form a complex at focal adhesions, which are important for regulating actin polymerization required for cellular movement (33Teng T.S. Lin B. Manser E. Ng D.C.H. Cao X. Stat3 promotes directional cell migration by regulating Rac1 activity via its activator βPIX.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 4150-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Silver D.L. Naora H. Liu J. Cheng W. Montell D.J. Activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Together, our data clearly demonstrate that the intracellular domain of PD-L1 contributes to membrane protein interactions that regulate motility and that these interactions are critical for lymphatic remodeling. We had previously identified a cytoplasmic motif region within murine PD-L1 that contributed to DC chemotaxis (1Lucas E.D. Schafer J.B. Matsuda J. Kraus M. Burchill M.A. Tamburini B.A.J. PD-L1 reverse signaling in dermal dendritic cells promotes dendritic cell migration required for skin immunity.Cell Rep. 2020; 33108258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that PD-L1 was important for LEC survival (11Lucas E.D.

Colpitts T.M. et al.Type 1 IFN and PD-L1 coordinate lymphatic endothelial cell expansion and contraction during an inflammatory immune response.J. Immunol. 2018; 201: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As DC and LEC movement and survival are important components of LN organization and responsiveness, we asked if there were differences in the LNs of WT or Pdl1CyMt mice, in which the cytoplasmic TSS motif is mutated to AAA (Supplemental Fig. 1A). We first evaluated LEC subsets by flow cytometry based on transcriptional signature as defined in (6Xiang M. Grosso R.A. Takeda A. Pan J. Bekkhus T. Brulois K."
https://openalex.org/W4308925190,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal muscle disease, caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein. Absence of functional dystrophin results in muscle weakness and degeneration, eventually leading to cardiac and respiratory failure. Strategies to replace the missing dystrophin via gene therapy have been intensively pursued. However, the dystrophin gene is too large for current gene therapy approaches. Currently available micro-dystrophin constructs lack the actin-binding domain 2 and show decreased actin-binding affinity in vitro compared to full-length dystrophin. Thus, increasing the actin-binding affinity of micro-dystrophin, using small molecules, could be a beneficial therapeutic approach. Here, we have developed and validated a novel high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to discover small molecules that increase the binding affinity of dystrophin's actin-binding domain 1 (ABD1). We engineered a novel FRET biosensor, consisting of the mClover3, fluorescent protein (donor) attached to the C-terminus of dystrophin ABD1, and Alexa Fluor 568 (acceptor) attached to the C-terminal cysteine of actin. We used this biosensor in small-molecule screening, using a unique high-precision, HTS fluorescence lifetime assay, identifying several compounds from an FDA-approved library that significantly increase the binding between actin and ABD1. This HTS assay establishes feasibility for the discovery of small-molecule modulators of the actin-dystrophin interaction, with the ultimate goal of developing therapies for muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W4308942402,"Network diffusion processes or how information spreads through networks have been widely examined in numerous disciplines such as epidemiology, physics, sociology, politics, or computer science. In this paper, we extend previous developments by considering a generalization of the diffusion by considering the possibility of differences in the speed of diffusion and reduction depending on the forces' directions. In this situation, the differential speed of diffusion produces deviations from the standard solution around the average of the initial conditions in the network. In fact, this asymmetry gives rise to non-linear dynamics in which, contrary to the symmetric case, the final solution depends on the topology of the graph as well as on the distribution of the initial values. Counter-intuitively, less central nodes in the network are able to exert a higher influence on the final solution. This behavior applies also for different simulated networks such as random, small-world, and scale-free. We show an example of this kind of asymmetric diffusion process in a real case. To do so, we use a network of US Boards of Directors, where boards are the nodes and the directors working for more than one board, are the links. Changes in the proportion of women serving on each board are influenced by the gradient between adjacent boards. We also show that there is an asymmetry: the gradient is reduced at a slower (faster) rhythm if the board has less (more) women than neighboring boards. We are able to quantify the accumulated effect of this asymmetry from 2000 to 2015 in the overall proportion of women on boards, in a 4.7 percentage points (the proportion should have been an 14.61% instead of the observed 9.93% in 2015)."

Moreover, there are increasing numbers of refugees and asylum seekers (AS), who often exhibit distinct disease profiles from those of the natives of the host country. If these differences could be clearly identified, this might help to develop and implement strategies to prevent injuries in health care programs for refugees and asylum seekers. The aim of this study was to examine the types and characteristics of physical trauma profiles in patients from the two largest groups of AS in Switzerland-from Eastern Africa (EA) and the Middle East (ME)-who consulted a Swiss Emergency Department (ED) in 2017/2018. Furthermore, the physical trauma profiles of Swiss national (SN) patients were examined in order to explore potential differences.Descriptive retrospective study of adult trauma patients consulting the ED of a Swiss University Hospital between 01/2017 and 12/2018. The study included 157 asylum seeking trauma patients from EA and ME were included in the study. These were matched by gender and age to 157 Swiss trauma patients consulting the ED in the study period.There were significant differences between the groups with respect to type of admission, level of severity, localization and mechanisms of injury. While SN had higher levels of injuries related to road traffic or work, AS had higher levels of injuries related to attempted suicide or to assault.There were differences between AS and the local population with respect to the characteristics and patterns of injury, so that strategies for preventing injuries and promoting health must be tailored to the target population. Moreover, the observed high rates of outpatient treatment for both groups underline the increasing role of EDs as primary care providers for the population served."

However, little is known about the crosstalk between metastasized tumor cells and target organs. Herein, we found that EFNB2 expression was upregulated in liver metastases (LM) of colorectal cancer (CRC), but not in pulmonary metastases (PM) or primary CRC tumors. EFNB2 played a tumor-promoting role in CRC LM in vitro and in vivo. Through forward signaling, EFNB2-promoted CRC LM by interacting with the EPHB4 receptor. EFNB2/EPHB4 axis enhances LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake in CRC LM. Subsequently, EFNB2/EPHB4 axis promotes LDLR transcription by regulating STAT3 phosphorylation. Blocking LDLR reversed the role of the EFNB2/EPHB4 axis in promoting CRC LM. Using clinical data, survival analysis revealed that the survival time of patients with CRC LM was decreased in patients with high EFNB2 expression, compared with low EFNB2 expression. Inhibition of the EFNB2/EPHB4 axis markedly prolonged the survival time of BALB/c nude mice with CRC LM with a high cholesterol diet. These findings revealed a key step in the regulation of cholesterol uptake by EFNB2/EPHB4 axis and its tumor-promoting role in CRC LM."

However, recent mouse investigations have described a second myogenic progenitor population that resides within the myofiber interstitium and expresses the transcription factor Twist2. Twist2-expressing cells exclusively repair and maintain type IIx/b muscle fibers. Currently, it is unknown if Twist2-expressing cells are present in human skeletal muscle and if they function as myogenic progenitors. Here, we perform a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and immunofluorescence staining to demonstrate the identity and localization of Twist2-expressing cells in human skeletal muscle. Twist2-expressing cells were identified to be anatomically and transcriptionally comparable to fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and lack expression of typical satellite cell markers such as Pax7. Comparative analysis revealed that human and mouse Twist2-expressing cells were highly transcriptionally analogous and resided within the same anatomical structures in vivo. Examination of young and aged skeletal muscle biopsy samples revealed that Twist2-positive cells are more prevalent in aged muscle and increase following 12-weeks of resistance exercise training (RET) in humans. However, the quantity of Twist2-positive cells was not correlated with indices of muscle mass or muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in young or older muscle, and their abundance was surprisingly, negatively correlated with CSA and myonuclear domain size following RET. Taken together, we have identified cells expressing Twist2 in human skeletal muscle which are responsive to aging and exercise. Further examination of their myogenic potential is warranted."

Two groups of 1 st-grade Italian children were tested respectively after 4 and 8 months of schooling, with a spelling-to-dictation task of single words created ad hoc by manipulating syllable frequency orthogonally (high vs low frequency of the first syllable) and length (short vs long words). The results show that after only four months of schooling, children could offset their difficulty in writing long words by taking advantage of the high frequency of the initial syllable. However, the regularity of Italian spelling makes it easy to capture fine-sized phoneme-to-grapheme units, rendering the syllable effect no longer detectable in more schooled children."
https://openalex.org/W4308993313,"Objective This study aimed to assess the time to first culture conversion and its predictors among MDR/RR-TB cases enrolled in Dilchora Hospital. Method A retrospective cohort study was conducted among MDR/RR TB cases enrolled between January 2014 and December 2018. SPSS version 26 was used for analysis. Reports are presented using percentages and frequency. Independent predictors of time-to-culture conversion were identified using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. Adjusted and crude hazard ratio with 95% CI was used. P-value&lt; 0.05 declared statistical significance. Result A total of 145 MDR/RR TB cases were included. The median time to culture conversion was at 2 months. Higher baseline hemoglobin [AHR:1.101(1.02–1.19)] and having a non-cavitary lesion on chest x-ray[AHR:1.803(1.15–2.83)] predicted a higher likelihood of early culture conversion. Resistance to at least one first-line anti-TB drug in addition to rifampicin was associated with a lower hazard of early culture conversion as compared to only rifampicin resistance[AHR: 0.577(0.37–0.91)]. Conclusion &amp; recommendation A baseline hemoglobin level, chest x-ray finding of cavitation and resistance to rifampicin, and at least one additional drug predicted the time to culture conversion. A closer treatment monitoring and follow-up should be emphasized for those presenting with lower baseline hemoglobin, more drug resistance, and cavitation on chest x-ray."

Based on the 2000-2019 unbalanced panel data of listed Chinese family enterprises, this study empirically examines the differences in the influence of the implicit and explicit power of successors on incremental and radical innovation respectively. Our findings show that explicit power has a more positive impact on incremental innovation, while implicit power is more conducive to promoting radical innovation. In addition, the study finds that the reason why the explicit power of succession does not have a significant impact on radical innovation, that is, the reason why board dissent is not related to radical innovation, is that some of the major innovation decisions in the enterprise are not all made at formal meetings. The research conclusions not only extend the theoretical application of social embeddedness in family enterprises, but also provide certain practical guidance for promoting enterprise innovation."

Inclusion criteria were: (1)type 2 diabetes, (2)diabetes duration of at least six months, and (3)adults aged 45-80 years. Purposive sampling enabled recruitment of heterogeneous participants. Also, two experts' panels with healthcare providers involved in diabetes care (n = 23) were conducted to provide triangulation of information (more testimony about what is valuable for people with type 2 diabetes). Discussions were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed.Four domains were deemed valuable for people with type 2 diabetes: (1)challenges of living with diabetes, including reduced physical function, healthy lifestyle struggles, sexual dysfunction, and financial burden, (2)mental health issues, including depression, distress, anxiety, frustration, and loneliness, (3)self-management ability, including management of lifestyle modifications and treatment, knowledge about the disease and treatment, and (4)patient-clinician relationships, including the devotion of clinicians, trust in clinicians and treatment, shared decision-making, and multidisciplinary care under one roof.

https://openalex.org/W4308993406,"Alternatives to conventional chicken meat and egg production are increasingly under discussion, especially because of the common practice of killing male day-old chicks from laying lines which has been banned from the beginning of 2022 in Germany and is planned to be banned during 2022 in other countries. Production of dual-purpose chicken lines is one possible solution, as such lines combine moderate laying and growth performance. The microbiological status of products from such breeds must be comparable to existing products on the market for food safety purposes. Additionally, the production of such products will take longer because of the feeding regimes required, and again, comparability should be safeguarded for the best consumer protection. The dual-purpose chicken line, Lohmann Dual (males), was compared to males from the laying line Lohmann Brown Plus, conventional laying hens (all slaughtered and processed in the same conventional laying hen abattoir), and conventional broilers (slaughtered in a conventional broiler abattoir). Neck skin samples were taken before chilling at the end of each slaughter line to determine the microbial status of the carcasses. Additionally, fresh and cooked meat sensory analysis was performed on meat from broilers and male and female Lohmann Dual and Lohmann Brown Plus chickens (for three carcasses of each group) at the German Agricultural Society Test Center in Kassel. The focus was on the performance of male Lohmann Dual compared to the other lines. There was no difference in the Enterobacteriaceae count of the dual-purpose chicken line compared to conventional broilers, whereas laying hens had a significantly higher microbial load before chilling, as based on neck skin examinations (p&lt;0.001). According to sensory test results, the meat from dual-purpose chickens was the best (as no defects were found) among the five chicken meat types examined. In conclusion, based on their microbial status and sensory analysis of fresh and cooked meat, Lohmann Dual males slaughtered in a laying hen abattoir can be considered as an alternative to conventionally kept broilers slaughtered in a broiler abattoir."

The projection pursuit model (PPM), as well as the system gray prediction model GM (1, N) and other measurement methods, were used to construct an evaluation system accounting for green fortune, growth, and benefits to analyze the temporal evolution, developmental trends, and influencing factors of the ecological engineering construction area in Baoshan, Yunnan Province. The results revealed a relatively good green development system, with an upward trend, an average growth rate of 18.3%, and a synergistic coupling effect among the three subsystems. Regional green development has achieved remarkable progress, but challenges and pressure among the three subsystems remain. The prediction analysis also showed that the green development index in Baoshan will continue to increase over the next two years, suggesting that the regional green development system is effective. Green development is primarily affected by environmental pollution, industrial structure, urbanization, population, market, and other factors from the three subsystems of ecology, economy, and social benefits. This study provides practical reference values for prompting regional ecological advancement and green development, along with regional support for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."
https://openalex.org/W4308993589,"Malaria vector control interventions in Sumba, Indonesia, have not been able to eliminate malaria. Human drivers of exposure to Anopheles bites were investigated as part of a larger clinical trial evaluating the impact of a spatial repellent product on malaria incidence. Human behavioral observations (HBOs) evaluating temporal and spatial presence, sleeping behaviors, and insecticide treated net (ITN) use, were collected parallel to entomological collections—indoor and outdoor human landing catches (HLCs), and house hold surveys. Data demonstrates that mosquito access to humans, enabled by structurally open houses, is evident by the similar entomological landing rates both inside and outside households. The presence of animals inside houses was associated with increased mosquito entry–however, the number of humans present inside houses was not related to increased mosquito landing. Analyzing mosquito landing rates with human behavior data enables the spatial and temporal estimation of exposure to Anopheles bites, accounting for intervention (ITN) presence and usage. Human behavior adjusted exposure to Anopheles bites was found to be highest in the early in the evening, but continued at lower levels throughout the night. Over the night, most exposure (53%) occurred when people were indoors and not under the protection of nets (asleep or awake) followed by exposure outside (44%). Characterized gaps in protection are outdoor exposure as well as exposure indoors–when awake, and when asleep and not using ITNs. Interestingly, in the primary trial, even though there was not a significant impact of the spatial repellent on vector biting rates by themselves (16%), when factoring in human behavior, there was approximately 28% less exposure in the intervention arm than in the placebo arm. The treated arm had less human behavior adjusted bites in all spaces evaluated though there was proportionally higher exposure indoors. This analysis points to the importance of using HBOs both towards understanding gaps in protection as well as how interventions are evaluated. To mitigate ongoing transmission, understanding context specific spatial and temporal exposure based on the interactions of vectors, humans and interventions would be vital for a directed evidence-based control or elimination strategy."

This cross-sectional study conducted in the city of Wonju, Gangwon Province, Korea (n = 1,096) examined the differences in COVID-19 vaccine trust and hesitancy considering individual characteristics and investigated the effects of SC on COVID-19 vaccine trust and hesitancy. SC was measured based on 14 items pertaining to social trust, network, and norms. Responses regarding COVID-19 screening history, vaccine trust, and vaccine hesitancy were also assessed. SC scores did not differ between sexes, but differed significantly according to age and household income; thus, adults aged 70–79 years had the highest SC scores, and mean SC score increased significantly with income. COVID-19 vaccine trust differed significantly according to age, average household income, social organization involvement, and SC score. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy differed significantly with age, SC score, and COVID-19 screening history. In univariate logistic regression, age, average household income, social organization involvement, and SC score were significant predictors of vaccine trust; in multivariable analysis, however, the identified predictors were age and SC. In particular, people with an SC score ≥50 were 2.660 times more likely to trust COVID-19 vaccines than those with lower scores. In multivariable analysis, age and SC were significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy. In particular, people with an SC score ≥50 were 1.400 times more likely not to be hesitant about receiving COVID-19 vaccines than people with lower scores. These results indicate that prioritizing policies to increase SC and trust in the government could boost the COVID-19 vaccination rate."
https://openalex.org/W4308993704,"Massive biological databases of species occurrences, or georeferenced locations where a species has been observed, are essential inputs for modeling present and future species distributions. Location accuracy is often assessed by determining whether the observation geocoordinates fall within the boundaries of the declared political divisions. This otherwise simple validation is complicated by the difficulty of matching political division names to the correct geospatial object. Spelling errors, abbreviations, alternative codes, and synonyms in multiple languages present daunting name disambiguation challenges. The inability to resolve political division names reduces usable data, and analysis of erroneous observations can lead to flawed results. Here, we present the Geographic Name Resolution Service (GNRS), an application for correcting, standardizing, and indexing world political division names. The GNRS resolves political division names against a reference database that combines names and codes from GeoNames with geospatial object identifiers from the Global Administrative Areas Database (GADM). In a trial resolution of political division names extracted from &gt;270 million species occurrences, only 1.9%, representing just 6% of occurrences, matched exactly to GADM political divisions in their original form. The GNRS was able to resolve, completely or in part, 92% of the remaining 378,568 political division names, or 86% of the full biodiversity occurrence dataset. In assessing geocoordinate accuracy for &gt;239 million species occurrences, resolution of political divisions by the GNRS enabled the detection of an order of magnitude more errors and an order of magnitude more error-free occurrences. By providing a novel solution to a significant data quality impediment, the GNRS liberates a tremendous amount of biodiversity data for quantitative biodiversity research. The GNRS runs as a web service and is accessible via an API, an R package, and a web-based graphical user interface. Its modular architecture is easily integrated into existing data validation workflows."

Cyp4f18-deficient mice spontaneously develop psoriasis-like dermatitis. A significant increase in the number of IL-17A-positive gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the skin and enlargement of draining lymph nodes was observed. These symptoms were drastically suppressed by antibiotic treatment. Cyp4f18 is highly expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), and Cyp4f18-deficient bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) show markedly increased expression levels of cytokines such as IL-23 and IL-1β in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Lipidomic analysis of lymph nodes and BMDCs revealed a significant decrease in a series of omega-3 epoxidized metabolites. Among them, 17,18-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-diHETE), a vicinal diol derived from EPA omega-3 epoxidation suppressed IL-23 production in LPS-stimulated BMDCs in Cyp4f18-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that Cyp4f18 endogenously produces omega-3-epoxidized metabolites in the draining lymph nodes, and these metabolites contribute to skin homeostasis by suppressing the excessive activation of the IL-23/IL-17 axis initiated by DCs."

Various mutations have been introduced in recent years and have enabled high-efficacy, stabilized, and organ-oriented transduction. Our purpose for using rAAV is to express our target gene in the mouse lung to investigate pulmonary artery hypertension. We constructed a self-complementary AAV having mutant capsids with the ESGHGYF insert, which directs the vectors to lung endothelial cells. However, when this mutant virus was purified from the producing cells by the conventional method using an ultracentrifuge, it resulted in a low yield. In addition, the purification method using an ultracentrifuge is tedious and labor-intensive. Therefore, we aimed to develop a simple, high-quality method for obtaining enough lung-targeted rAAV. First, we modified amino acids (T491V and Y730F) of the capsid to stabilize the rAAV from degradation, and we optimized culture conditions. Next, we noticed that many rAAVs were released from the cells into the culture medium. We, therefore, improved our purification method by purifying from the culture medium without the ultracentrifugation step. Purification without ultracentrifugation had the problem that impurities were mixed in, causing inflammation. However, by performing PEG precipitation and chloroform extraction twice, we were able to purify rAAV that caused only as little inflammation as that obtained by the ultracentrifuge method. Sufficient rAAV was obtained and can now be administered to a rat as well as mice from a single dish: 1.50 × 1013 ± 3.58 × 1012 vector genome from one φ150 mm dish (mean ± SEM)."
