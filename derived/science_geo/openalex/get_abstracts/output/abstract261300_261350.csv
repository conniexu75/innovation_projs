https://openalex.org/W2151046665,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that regulate the stability or translation of mRNA transcripts. Although recent work has implicated miRNAs in development and in disease, the expression and function of miRNAs in the adult mammalian nervous system have not been extensively characterized. Here, we examine the role of two brain-specific miRNAs, miR-219 and miR-132, in modulating the circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. miR-219 is a target of the CLOCK and BMAL1 complex, exhibits robust circadian rhythms of expression, and the in vivo knockdown of miR-219 lengthens the circadian period. miR-132 is induced by photic entrainment cues via a MAPK/CREB-dependent mechanism, modulates clock-gene expression, and attenuates the entraining effects of light. Collectively, these data reveal miRNAs as clock- and light-regulated genes and provide a mechanistic examination of their roles as effectors of pacemaker activity and entrainment."
https://openalex.org/W2008352401,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is the best established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We conducted genome-wide surveys of 502,627 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to characterize and confirm other LOAD susceptibility genes. In epsilon4 carriers from neuropathologically verified discovery, neuropathologically verified replication, and clinically characterized replication cohorts of 1411 cases and controls, LOAD was associated with six SNPs from the GRB-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) gene and a common haplotype encompassing the entire GAB2 gene. SNP rs2373115 (p = 9 x 10(-11)) was associated with an odds ratio of 4.06 (confidence interval 2.81-14.69), which interacts with APOE epsilon4 to further modify risk. GAB2 was overexpressed in pathologically vulnerable neurons; the Gab2 protein was detected in neurons, tangle-bearing neurons, and dystrophic neuritis; and interference with GAB2 gene expression increased tau phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that GAB2 modifies LOAD risk in APOE epsilon4 carriers and influences Alzheimer's neuropathology."
https://openalex.org/W2047198245,"Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is required for production of the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated Abeta protein. BACE levels are elevated in AD brain, and increasing evidence reveals BACE as a stress-related protease that is upregulated following cerebral ischemia. However, the molecular mechanism responsible is unknown. We show that increases in BACE and beta-secretase activity are due to posttranslational stabilization following caspase activation. We also found that during cerebral ischemia, levels of GGA3, an adaptor protein involved in BACE trafficking, are reduced, while BACE levels are increased. RNAi silencing of GGA3 also elevated levels of BACE and Abeta. Finally, in AD brain samples, GGA3 protein levels were significantly decreased and inversely correlated with increased levels of BACE. In summary, we have elucidated a GGA3-dependent mechanism regulating BACE levels and beta-secretase activity. This mechanism may explain increased cerebral levels of BACE and Abeta following cerebral ischemia and existing in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2150929636,"Within the medial frontal cortex, the supplementary eye field (SEF), supplementary motor area (SMA), and pre-SMA have been implicated in the control of voluntary action, especially during motor sequences or tasks involving rapid choices between competing response plans. However, the precise roles of these areas remain controversial. Here, we study two extremely rare patients with microlesions of the SEF and SMA to demonstrate that these areas are critically involved in unconscious and involuntary motor control. We employed masked-prime stimuli that evoked automatic inhibition in healthy people and control patients with lateral premotor or pre-SMA damage. In contrast, our SEF/SMA patients showed a complete reversal of the normal inhibitory effect--ocular or manual--corresponding to the functional subregion lesioned. These findings imply that the SEF and SMA mediate automatic effector-specific suppression of motor plans. This automatic mechanism may contribute to the participation of these areas in the voluntary control of action."
https://openalex.org/W2099645775,"Background Honey bees (Apis mellifera) provide a principal example of diphenic development. Excess feeding of female larvae results in queens (large reproductives). Moderate diet yields workers (small helpers). The signaling pathway that links provisioning to female developmental fate is not understood, yet we reasoned that it could include TOR (target of rapamycin), a nutrient- and energy-sensing kinase that controls organismal growth. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, the role of Apis mellifera TOR (amTOR) in caste determination is examined by rapamycin/FK506 pharmacology and RNA interference (RNAi) gene knockdown. We show that in queen-destined larvae, the TOR inhibitor rapamycin induces the development of worker characters that are blocked by the antagonist FK506. Further, queen fate is associated with elevated activity of the Apis mellifera TOR encoding gene, amTOR, and amTOR gene knockdown blocks queen fate and results in individuals with worker morphology. Conclusions/Significance A much-studied insect dimorphism, thereby, can be governed by the TOR pathway. Our results present the first evidence for a role of TOR in diphenic development, and suggest that adoption of this ancestral nutrient-sensing cascade is one evolutionary pathway for morphological caste differentiation in social insects."
https://openalex.org/W2033328335,"Endocannabinoids (eCBs) have emerged as key activity-dependent signals that, by activating presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (i.e., CB1) coupled to G(i/o) protein, can mediate short-term and long-term synaptic depression (LTD). While the presynaptic mechanisms underlying eCB-dependent short-term depression have been identified, the molecular events linking CB1 receptors to LTD are unknown. Here we show in the hippocampus that long-term, but not short-term, eCB-dependent depression of inhibitory transmission requires presynaptic cAMP/PKA signaling. We further identify the active zone protein RIM1alpha as a key mediator of both CB1 receptor effects on the release machinery and eCB-dependent LTD in the hippocampus. Moreover, we show that eCB-dependent LTD in the amygdala and hippocampus shares major mechanistic features. These findings reveal the signaling pathway by which CB1 receptors mediate long-term effects of eCBs in two crucial brain structures. Furthermore, our results highlight a conserved mechanism of presynaptic plasticity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2156509935,"NGF controls survival, differentiation, and target innervation of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic DRG sensory neurons. The common receptor for GDNF family ligands, Ret, is highly expressed in nonpeptidergic neurons, but its function during development of these neurons is unclear. Here, we show that expression of Ret and its coreceptors GFRα1 and GFRα2 is dependent on NGF. GFR/Ret signaling, in turn, autoregulates expression of both GFRα1 and GFRα2 and promotes expression of TrpA1, MrgA1, MrgA3, and MrgB4, acquisition of normal neuronal size, axonal innervation of the epidermis, and postnatal extinction of the NGF receptor TrkA. Moreover, NGF controls expression of several other genes characteristic of nonpeptidergic neurons, such as TrpC3, TrpM8, MrgD, and the transcription factor Runx1, via a Ret-independent signaling pathway. These findings support a model in which NGF controls maturation of nonpeptidergic DRG neurons through a combination of GFR/Ret-dependent and -independent signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1989186234,"The xanthophyll cycle has a major role in protecting plants from photooxidative stress, although the mechanism of its action is unclear. Here, we have investigated Arabidopsis plants overexpressing a gene encoding β-carotene hydroxylase, containing nearly three times the amount of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids present in the wild-type. In high light at low temperature wild-type plants exhibited symptoms of severe oxidative stress: lipid peroxidation, chlorophyll bleaching, and photoinhibition. In transformed plants, which accumulate over twice as much zeaxanthin as the wild-type, these symptoms were significantly ameliorated. The capacity of non-photochemical quenching is not significantly different in transformed plants compared with wild-type and therefore an enhancement of this process cannot be the cause of the stress tolerant phenotype. Rather, it is concluded that it results from the antioxidant effect of zeaxanthin. 80–90% of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in wild-type and transformed plants was localized to an oligomeric LHCII fraction prepared from thylakoid membranes. The binding of these pigments in intact membranes was confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Based on the structural model of LHCII, we suggest that the protein/lipid interface is the active site for the antioxidant activity of zeaxanthin, which mediates stress tolerance by the protection of bound lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1965772438,"Enduring forms of synaptic plasticity are thought to require ongoing regulation of adhesion molecules, such as N-cadherin, at synaptic junctions. Little is known about the activity-regulated trafficking of adhesion molecules. Here we demonstrate that surface N-cadherin undergoes a surprisingly high basal rate of internalization. Upon activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR), the rate of N-cadherin endocytosis is significantly reduced, resulting in an accumulation of N-cadherin in the plasma membrane. β-catenin, an N-cadherin binding partner, is a primary regulator of N-cadherin endocytosis. Following NMDAR stimulation, β-catenin accumulates in spines and exhibits increased binding to N-cadherin. Overexpression of a mutant form of β-catenin, Y654F, prevents the NMDAR-dependent regulation of N-cadherin internalization, resulting in stabilization of surface N-cadherin molecules. Furthermore, the stabilization of surface N-cadherin blocks NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity. These results indicate that NMDAR activity regulates N-cadherin endocytosis, providing a mechanistic link between structural plasticity and persistent changes in synaptic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2070107876,"Background Pathogens transmitted by ticks cause human disease on a greater scale than any other vector-borne infections in Europe, and have increased dramatically over the past 2–3 decades. Reliable records of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) since 1970 show an especially sharp upsurge in cases in Eastern Europe coincident with the end of Soviet rule, including the three Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, where national incidence increased from 1992 to 1993 by 64, 175 and 1,065%, respectively. At the county level within each country, however, the timing and degree of increase showed marked heterogeneity. Climate has also changed over this period, prompting an almost universal assumption of causality. For the first time, we analyse climate and TBE epidemiology at sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to question this assumption. Methodology/Principal Finding Detailed analysis of instrumental records of climate has revealed a significant step increase in spring-time daily maximum temperatures in 1989. The seasonal timing and precise level of this warming were indeed such as could promote the transmission of TBE virus between larval and nymphal ticks co-feeding on rodents. These changes in climate, however, are virtually uniform across the Baltic region and cannot therefore explain the marked spatio-temporal heterogeneity in TBE epidemiology. Conclusions/Significance Instead, it is proposed that climate is just one of many different types of factors, many arising from the socio-economic transition associated with the end of Soviet rule, that have acted synergistically to increase both the abundance of infected ticks and the exposure of humans to these ticks. Understanding the precise differential contribution of each factor as a cause of the observed epidemiological heterogeneity will help direct control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2100449187,"Background The prolonged time course of Huntington's disease (HD) neurodegeneration increases both the time and cost of testing potential therapeutic compounds in mammalian models. An alternative is to initially assess the efficacy of compounds in invertebrate models, reducing time of testing from months to days. Methodology/Principal Findings We screened candidate therapeutic compounds that were identified previously in cell culture/animal studies in a C. elegans HD model and found that two FDA approved drugs, lithium chloride and mithramycin, independently and in combination suppressed HD neurotoxicity. Aging is a critical contributor to late onset neurodegenerative diseases. Using a genetic strategy and a novel assay, we demonstrate that lithium chloride and mithramycin remain neuroprotective independent of activity of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16, which mediates the effects of the insulin-like signaling pathway on aging. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that pathways involved in polyglutamine-induced degeneration are distinct from specific aging pathways. The assays presented here will be useful for rapid and inexpensive testing of other potential HD drugs and elucidating pathways of drug action. Additionally, the neuroprotection conferred by lithium chloride and mithramycin suggests that these drugs may be useful for polyglutamine disease therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2096064481,"Defective bone formation is common in patients with diabetes, suggesting that insulin normally exerts anabolic actions in bone. However, because insulin can cross-activate the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R), which also functions in bone, it has been difficult to establish the direct (IGF-1-independent) actions of insulin in osteoblasts. To overcome this problem, we examined insulin signaling and action in primary osteoblasts engineered for conditional disruption of the IGF-1 receptor (ΔIGF-1R). Calvarial osteoblasts from mice carrying floxed IGF-1R alleles were infected with adenoviral vectors expressing the Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) or green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) as control. Disruption of IGF-1R mRNA (>90%) eliminated IGF-1R without affecting insulin receptor (IR) mRNA and protein expression and eliminated IGF-1R/IR hybrids. In ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts, insulin signaling was markedly increased as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1/2 and enhanced ERK/Akt activation. Microarray analysis of RNA samples from insulin-treated, ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts revealed striking changes in several genes known to be downstream of ERK including Glut-1 and c-fos. Treatment of osteoblasts with insulin induced Glut-1 mRNA, increased 2-[1,2-3H]-deoxy-d-glucose uptake, and enhanced proliferation. Moreover, insulin treatment rescued the defective differentiation and mineralization of ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts, suggesting that IR signaling can compensate, at least in part, for loss of IGF-1R signaling. We conclude that insulin exerts direct anabolic actions in osteoblasts by activation of its cognate receptor and that the strength of insulin-generated signals is tempered through interactions with the IGF-1R. Defective bone formation is common in patients with diabetes, suggesting that insulin normally exerts anabolic actions in bone.

During evolution, this primitive receptor pathway diverged into two distinct hormonal systems that in mammals serve different but overlapping developmental and metabolic functions (1Nakae J. Kido Y. Accili D. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 818-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 2Kim J.J. Accili D. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2002; 12: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These receptors belong to the family of ligand-activated receptor kinases and are abundantly expressed in osteoblasts (3Thomas D.M. Hards D.K. Rogers S.D. Ng K.W. Best J.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1312-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Pun K.K. Lau P. Ho P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unlike other receptor tyrosine kinases, these proteins exist at the cell surface as homodimers composed of two identical α/β (α2/β2) monomers or as heterodimers (discussed below) composed of two different receptor monomers (e.g. IRαβ/IGF-1Rαβ). Upon ligand binding, they undergo a conformational change that facilitates binding to ATP and autophosphorylation (5Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 6Wei L. Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8122-8130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation increases the kinase activity of IR-type receptors by 3 orders of magnitude, enabling them to phosphorylate a number of substrate proteins and engender growth or metabolic responses (7Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). IRS proteins act as mediators of insulin, IGF, and cytokine signaling in a variety of cell types. These adaptor molecules recruit and activate downstream signaling cascades such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (8Taniguchi C.M. Emanuelli B. Kahn C.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). In addition to forming homodimers, IR and IGF-1R can form heterodimers with each other (9Treadway J.L. Frattali A.L. Pessin J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11801-11805Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Bailyes E.M. Nave B.T. Soos M.A. Orr S.R. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, it is still controversial whether these “hybrid” receptors subserve specific functions, e.g. by recruiting different substrates, especially because the phenotypes of the different receptor knock-outs are distinct, i.e. diabetes in IR knock-outs and dwarfism in IGF-1R knock-outs.Whereas IGF-1 is a well established bone anabolic agent (11Zhao G. Monier-Faugere M.C. Langub M.C. Geng Z. Nakayama T. Pike J.W. Chernausek S.D. Rosen C.J. Donahue L.R. Malluche H.H. Fagin J.A. Clemens T.L.

Lumpkin Jr., C.K. Bunn R.C. Kemp S.F. Fowlkes J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E735-E745Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with decreased bone density, an increased risk for osteoporosis (14Kemink S.A. Hermus A.R. Swinkels L.M. Lutterman J.A. Smals A.G. J. Endocrinol. Investig. 2000; 23: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and fragility fracture (15Nicodemus K.K. Folsom A.R. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), as well as poor bone healing and regeneration characteristics (16Loder R.T. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1988; 232: 210-216PubMed Google Scholar); conditions that all rely, in part, upon intramembranous bone formation. Quantitative histomorphometry on bone from diabetic animal models reveals a decreased osteoblast surface, osteoid surface, and mineral apposition rates (17Verhaeghe J. van Herck E. Visser W.J. Suiker A.M. Thomasset M. Einhorn T.A. Faierman E. Bouillon R. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and a marked decline in the expression of the transcription factors that control osteoblast differentiation (18Lu H. Kraut D. Gerstenfeld L.C. Graves D.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that diabetic rodents had impaired bone formation following bone injury compared with nondiabetic controls and that infusion of insulin into the distraction gap normalized bone formation in these models (19Thrailkill K.M. Liu L. Wahl E.C. Bunn R.C. Perrien D.S. Cockrell G.E. Skinner R.A. Hogue W.R. Carver A.A. Fowlkes J.L. Aronson J. Lumpkin Jr., C.K.

Bone. 2005; 37: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, defining the mechanisms of action of insulin and IGF-1 in bone has been difficult because of the potential for cross-talk between these two signaling pathways as described above.To examine the direct actions of insulin in osteoblasts and elucidate signaling pathways downstream of the IR, we developed a model for conditional removal of the IGF-1 receptor in vitro by adenoviral introduction of the Cre-recombinase to primary mouse osteoblasts derived from mice carrying floxed IGF-1R alleles. We show that osteoblasts lacking the IGF-1R are four to five times more sensitive to insulin than are cells expressing both receptors. These findings provide the first unequivocal evidence for direct actions of insulin on osteoblasts and suggest that the strength of insulin generated signals in this cell type is tempered through interactions with IGF-1R.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture medium, α-minimal essential medium (αMEM), was obtained from Cellgro-Mediatech (Herdon, VA), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Invitrogen. Bovine insulin was obtained from Sigma, dissolved in acidic water (pH 2–3) and stored in 1000× aliquots for single use. Human IGF-1 was obtained from GroPep (Theberton, SA, Australia) and stored in 1000× aliquots for single use. The IGF-1R inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation included anti-IGF-1R β subunit (C-20), anti-insulin receptor β subunit (C-19), anti-IRS-1 (C-20), anti-IRS-2 (H-205), anti-cyclin D1 (72–13G), and actin (C-11) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), and anti-ERK from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); anti-phosphotyrosine (Clone 4G10) from Upstate Cell Signaling (Lake Placid, NY); and nonimmune rabbit serum IgG from Alpha Diagnostic (San Antonio, TX). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Pierce, whereas horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Laemmli sample buffer, and other electrophoresis supplies were from Bio-Rad. Assay kits for flow cytometry analysis of cell proliferation and apoptosis were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). All other reagents not specified here were purchased from Sigma.Osteoblast Isolation and Culture—Osteoblasts were isolated from calvaria of newborn IGF-1Rflox/flox mice by serial digestion in 1.8 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) solution. Calvaria were digested in 10 ml of digestion solution for 15 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. The digestion solution was collected, and digestion was repeated with fresh digestion solution an additional four times. Digestions 3–5 (containing the osteoblasts) were pooled together, centrifuged, washed with αMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and plated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2. For in vitro deletion of the IGF-1R, osteoblasts containing floxed IGF-1R alleles were cultured to be 70% confluent and then, in a small volume of PBS, were infected with adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) (Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA) at a titer of 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI). Infection with 100 MOI of adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) (Vector Biolabs) was used as control. After 1 h, culture medium containing 10% FBS was added directly to the cells in the presence of virus, and the cells were allowed to recover for the next 48 h. Greater than 90% IGF-1R deletion was confirmed for every infection by real time PCR. The Ad-GFP-infected (hereon referred to as control cells) or Ad-Cre-infected (hereon referred to as ΔIGF-1R cells) osteoblasts were then replated on 100-mm tissue culture plates for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments or on 6-well plates for the proliferation and mineralization assays.Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—For signaling experiments, ΔIGF-1R and control cells were cultured in 10% FBS αMEM to 90% confluence and then serum-starved in 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h to reduce cellular activity to quiescent levels. At the end of the study, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). Protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) were added to the lysis buffer. The cell lysates were homogenized by rotating at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and protein concentration was measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitations, 1 μg of IR, IGF-1R, IRS-1, or IRS-2 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added into 1 ml of cell lysate (500 μg of total protein) and rotated at 4 °C overnight. The protein complexes were immunoprecipitated by protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed with immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl), dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, and then analyzed by immunoblotting as described next. For immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, equal amounts of protein (10 or 20 μg/lane) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto a mini-SDS-PAGE system. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad wet transfer system. Protein transfer efficiency was verified using prestained protein markers. The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies directed against the protein of interest. Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and bound antibodies were visualized using the Supersignal West Dura Substrate (Pierce). Western blot photographic results were scanned with a Canon flatbed scanner. The relative levels of proteins of interest were then determined by measuring the density of the corresponding bands with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). All of the values were averages of at least three experiments and were normalized to the protein expression of a normalization protein.Microarray Analysis—The ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts were cultured in 6-well plates in αMEM with 10% FBS till near confluent. The cells were serum-starved in 0.05% FBS for 48 h and then restimulated with 100 nm insulin for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted and quantified from cells using the TRIzol method as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Microarray quality biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized using 3 μg of RNA and subsequently purified as per TrueLabeling-AMP™ protocol recommended by manufacturer (SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD). 2 μg of cRNA was then hybridized overnight with an insulin signaling pathway-specific gene expression array, and chemiluminescence signal was detected on photosensitive film as per Oligo GEArray system protocol recommendation (SuperArray). The raw images were analyzed using web-based GEArray Expression Analysis Suite software. The expression value for each gene on the array was calculated with the software and was verified by visual comparison with the autoradiographs. The usable linear range of pixel intensity was established as 9,000–65,000 as described by others (21Zhou S. Glowacki J. Yates K.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1732-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Osteoblast Proliferation Assay—The ΔIGF-1R and control osteoblasts were plated in 6-well plates at low cell density (9 × 104 cells/well of a 6-well plate) and cultured in αMEM with 1% FBS for 24 h to arrest the cells in G0 phase. The cells were then restimulated with 10 nm insulin, 13 nm IGF-1, or 10% serum for the next 24 h. For proliferation analysis of the cells, 10 μm BrdUrd was added to the medium 12 h before harvesting cells. The cells were then stained for anti-BrdUrd-APC and 7-amino-actinomycin D for proliferation and analyzed by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson), 20,000 events were collected for each sample, and the results were analyzed with WinMDI version 2.8.Alkaline Phosphatase and von Kossa Staining—The ΔIGF-1R and control osteoblasts were cultured in 6-well plates with 2.0 × 105 cells/well in αMEM with 10% FBS for 4 days until they were confluent. The medium was then changed to osteogenic medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate to αMEM for next 15 days. The medium was changed every other day, and 10 or 100 nm insulin or 13 nm IGF-1 was supplemented with each medium change. Alkaline phosphatase and von Kossa histochemical staining was performed for 0-, 3-, 7-, and 14-day samples. The cells were washed with cold PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, and stored at 4 °C in 100 mm cacodylic acid buffer (pH 7.4). For alkaline phosphatase staining, the fixed cells were incubated at 37 °C with freshly prepared alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (100 mm Tris-maleate buffer, pH 8.4, 2.8% N,N-dimethyl formamide (v/v), 1 mg/ml Fast Red TR, and 0.5 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate) until red color developed. For von Kossa staining, the fixed cells were exposed to UV light in the presence of 3% silver nitrate (AgNO3). The reaction was terminated by removing AgNO3 solution and washing the monolayer carefully with water.[3H]2-Deoxyglucose (2-DOG) Uptake Assay—The ΔIGF-1R and control osteoblasts were cultured in 12-well plates till confluent. The cells were serum-starved in αMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 3 h. Then the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 0.45 ml of KRH (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, and 1.25 mm CaCl2) in the presence or absence of 10 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. For [3H]2-DOG uptake, 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μCi of 2-[1,2-3H]-deoxy-d-glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 mm 2-DOG was added to each well for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 200 mm 2-DOG into each well. The cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min. The incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting of 400 μl of each sample in triplicate. Nonspecific passive [3H]2-DOG uptake control measured as a treatment with 10 μm cytochalasin B was subtracted from each value.Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol method as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The RNA concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically, and only pure RNA (A260:A280 ratio ≥ 1.8) was used for further analysis. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The cDNA was amplified in the Opticon Continuous Fluorescent Detector (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) using IQ™ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) and sequence specific primers. PCRs were performed in triplicate for each cDNA, averaged, and normalized to endogenous β-actin reference transcripts. Primer sequences used were as follows: IGF-1R, F5′-TTGTGTTGTTCGTCCGGTGTG-3′, R5′-ATGTGCCCAAGTGTGTGCG-3′; IR, F5′-TCAAGACCAGACCCGAAGATT-3′, R5′-GTGATACCAGAGGATAGGAG-3′; β-actin, F5′-ACCTCCTACAATGAGCTGC-3′, R5′-TGCCAATAGTGATGACCT-3′; Glut1, F5′-CTCTGTCGGGGGCATGATTG-3′, R5′-TTGGAGAAGCCCATAAGCACA-3′; Osteocalcin, F5′-GACAAAGCCTTCATGTCCAAG-3′, R5′-AAAGCCGAGCTGCCAGAGTTT-3′; and Runx-2, F5′-CCAAATTTGCCTAACAGAATG-3′, R5′-GAGGCTGTGGTTTCAAAGCA-3′.Statistical Analysis—All of the statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft Excel data analysis program for Student's t test analysis with an assigned significance level of 0.05 (α). All of the experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise stated. The values are expressed as the means ± S.E.RESULTSCre-mediated Disruption of IGF-1R and Hybrid Receptors in Primary Mouse Osteoblasts—To selectively delete the IGF-1R, primary calvarial osteoblasts from mice carrying floxed IGF-1R alleles were infected with either adeno-GFP (Ad-GFP) or adeno-Cre (Ad-Cre) virus as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1A, osteoblasts infected with increasing loads of Ad-Cre expressed progressively less IGF-1R mRNA as compared with those infected with Ad-GFP. Infection with 100 MOI Ad-Cre virus decreased IGF-1R mRNA and protein expression more than 90% compared with 100 MOI Ad-GFP infected cells (Fig. 1, B and D). In the same samples, IR mRNA and protein expression was unaffected in Ad-Cre-infected cells compared with Ad-GFP-infected cells (Fig. 1, C and E). Primary calvarial osteoblasts infected with Ad-Cre virus (thus lacking the IGF-1R) are hereafter referred to as ΔIGF-1R, whereas Ad-GFP-infected cells (thus expressing IGF-1R) are indicated as control cells. To detect hybrid receptors in control and ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either IR (Fig. 1F) or IGF-1R (Fig. 1G) antibodies and immunoblotted with both antibodies. IR/IGF-1R hybrid receptor were clearly detected in cells expressing both IR and IGF-1R but were greatly diminished in ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts (Fig. 1, F and G). The apparent increase in abundance of the immunoreactive IR in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1F, bottom right) might reflect increased amounts of IR homodimers or alternatively indicates that the immunoprecipitating IR antibody preferentially recognizes homodimeric receptor.Loss of the IGF-1R Enhances Sensitivity to Insulin-induced IR and IRS Phosphorylation—To investigate the effects of IGF-1R disruption on immediate IR signaling, we examined IR autophosphorylation in these cells. The ΔIGF-1R and control cells were serum-starved, treated with insulin for 5 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with the anti-IRβ antibody. Western blot analysis with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody showed that insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in both ΔIGF-1R and control cells (Fig. 2, A and C). However, in the ΔIGF-1R cells, IR was more responsive to insulin, leading to IR autophosphorylation at 100-fold lower insulin concentrations (0.1 nm) when compared with equivalent activation in control cells at the concentration of 10 nm.FIGURE 2Disruption of IGF-1R in vitro sensitizes osteoblast to insulin receptor. ΔIGF-1R or control osteoblasts were cultured to confluence and then serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were then stimulated with insulin (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nm) for 5 min. The cells were lysed, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-IR β-chain antibody. A, the immunocomplexes were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-phosho-Tyr antibody (top panel) or the anti-IR β-chain antibody (bottom panel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, control and ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IR-β antibody or nonimmune serum rabbit IgG (NIS). The immunocomplexes were immunoblotted with anti-IR-β antibody. NIS did not immunoprecipitate insulin-receptor, whereas insulin receptor β antibody did, showing the specificity of the IRβ antibody. C, the immunoblots in A were quantified by densitometry and plotted to compare ratio of Tyr(P)-IR to IR in control cells (open bars) and ΔIGF-1R cells (solid bars). The data from three separate experiments are represented as the means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated the effect of disruption of the IGF-1R on insulin and IGF-1 stimulation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Under basal conditions, deletion of IGF-1R decreases phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2. In the presence of IGF-1R, both insulin and IGF-1 induced a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, in ΔIGF-1R cells insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, normalized to the untreated group, was more robust compared with insulin treatment in control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, IGF-1 did not induce IRS-1 phosphorylation in the ΔIGF-1R cells. Basal IRS-2 activation was slightly diminished in the ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts but was not significantly altered in control or mutant osteoblasts with insulin treatment. This suggests that insulin may preferentially act through IRS-1 in osteoblasts and induce a robust IRS-1 phosphorylation in the absence of IGF-1R.FIGURE 3Selective insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 in ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts. ΔIGF-1R or control osteoblasts were cultured to confluence and then serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were then stimulated with insulin (INS) (10 nm) or IGF-1 (13 nm) for 5 min, and no treatment (NT) groups were cultured in the absence of insulin or IGF-1. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-IRS-1 antibody (A) or anti-IRS-2 antibody (C). The resulting immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) for anti-Tyr(P) antibody (top panel, A and C), anti-IRS-1 antibody (bottom panel, A), or the anti-IRS-2 antibody (bottom panel, C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The densitometric quantification (means ± S.E.) of blots in A and C is shown in B and D, respectively, measuring the ratio of Tyr(P) to corresponding IRS protein in control cells (open bars) and ΔIGF-1R cells (solid bars)(n = 3). *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Loss of the IGF-1R Enhances Sensitivity to Insulin-induced Akt and ERK Phosphorylation—Ligand binding to IR and IGF-1R activates two major signaling pathways: Akt and ERK. As shown in Fig. 4, IGF-1 acutely stimulated Akt (Fig. 4, A and B, left panels) and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D, left panels) in control cells, whereas these effects were nearly abolished in ΔIGF-1R cells. Interestingly, insulin treatment resulted in significantly greater induction of Akt and ERK phosphorylation in ΔIGF-1R cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4, right panels). The enhanced insulin sensitivity in ΔIGF-1R cells is opposite of that observed for growth hormone signaling where removal of the IGF-1R diminishes growth hormone induction of JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) phosphorylation (22DiGirolamo, D. J., Mukherjee, A., Wang, Y., Liu, X., Frank, S. J., and Clemens, T. L. (2005) in 27th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, September 23–27, 2005, Washington, D.C.Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Enhanced insulin-induced Akt and ERK activation in ΔIGF-1R osteoblasts. ΔIGF-1R or control osteoblasts were cultured to confluence and then serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were then restimulated with insulin (10 nm) or IGF-1 (13 nm) for 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 min. The cells were lysed, and 10 μg of total protein was separated by electrophoresis and then analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phospho-Akt (top panel, A) and total Akt (bottom panel, A) or phospho-ERK (top panel, C) and total ERK (bottom panel, C). The immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and plotted as a ratio of phospho-Akt to total Akt (B) or phospho-ERK to total ERK (D) comparing the effects of insulin or IGF-1 in control cells (dotted lines) and ΔIGF-1R cells (solid lines).

https://openalex.org/W2000500986,"Ca2+ signaling plays a central role in activity-dependent regulation of dendritic arborization, but key molecular mechanisms downstream of calcium elevation remain poorly understood. Here we show that the C-terminal region of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CLICK-III (CL3)/CaMKIγ, a membrane-anchored CaMK, was uniquely modified by two sequential lipidification steps: prenylation followed by a kinase-activity-regulated palmitoylation. These modifications were essential for CL3 membrane anchoring and targeting into detergent-resistant lipid microdomains (or rafts) in the dendrites. We found that CL3 critically contributed to BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. Raft insertion of CL3 specifically promoted dendritogenesis of cortical neurons by acting upstream of RacGEF STEF and Rac, both present in lipid rafts. Thus, CL3 may represent a key element in the Ca2+-dependent and lipid-raft-delineated switch that turns on extrinsic activity-regulated dendrite formation in developing cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1974275159,"Photolysis of a caged Ca(2+) compound was used to characterize the dependence of cerebellar long-term synaptic depression (LTD) on postsynaptic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Elevating [Ca(2+)](i) was sufficient to induce LTD without requiring any of the other signals produced by synaptic activity. A sigmoidal relationship between [Ca(2+)](i) and LTD indicated a highly cooperative triggering of LTD by Ca(2+). The duration of the rise in [Ca(2+)](i) influenced the apparent Ca(2+) affinity of LTD, and this time-dependent behavior could be described by a leaky integrator process with a time constant of 0.6 s. A computational model, based on a positive-feedback cycle that includes protein kinase C and MAP kinase, was capable of simulating these properties of Ca(2+)-triggered LTD. Disrupting this cycle experimentally also produced the predicted changes in the Ca(2+) dependence of LTD. We conclude that LTD arises from a mechanism that integrates postsynaptic Ca(2+) signals and that this integration may be produced by the positive-feedback cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2161079618,"Copper is an essential trace metal whose biological utility is derived from its ability to cycle between oxidized Cu(II) and reduced Cu(I). Ctr1 is a high affinity plasma membrane copper permease, conserved from yeast to humans, that mediates the physiological uptake of Cu(I) from the extracellular environment. In the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) via the action of the cell surface metalloreductase Fre1, similar to the human gp91phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex, which utilizes heme and flavins to catalyze electron transfer. The S. cerevisiae Ctr2 protein is structurally similar to Ctr1, localizes to the vacuole membrane, and mobilizes vacuolar copper stores to the cytosol via a mechanism that is not well understood. Here we show that Ctr2-1, a mutant form of Ctr2 that mislocalizes to the plasma membrane, requires the Fre1 plasma membrane metalloreductase for Cu(I) import. The conserved methionine residues that are essential for Ctr1 function at the plasma membrane are also essential for Ctr2-1-mediated Cu(I) uptake. We demonstrate that Fre6, a member of the yeast Fre1 metalloreductase protein family, resides on the vacuole membrane and functions in Ctr2-mediated vacuolar copper export, and cells lacking Fre6 phenocopy the Cu-deficient growth defect of ctr2Δ cells. Furthermore, both CTR2 and FRE6 mRNA levels are regulated by iron availability. Taken together these studies suggest that copper movement across intracellular membranes is mechanistically similar to that at the plasma membrane. This work provides a model for communication between the extracellular Cu(I) uptake and the intracellular Cu(I) mobilization machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1988827926,"Despite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models."
https://openalex.org/W2031700956,"Comparative sequence analyses, including such fundamental bioinformatics techniques as similarity searching, sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference, have become a mainstay for researchers studying type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) genome structure and evolution. Implicit in comparative analyses is an underlying model of evolution, and the chosen model can significantly affect the results. In general, evolutionary models describe the probabilities of replacing one amino acid character with another over a period of time. Most widely used evolutionary models for protein sequences have been derived from curated alignments of hundreds of proteins, usually based on mammalian genomes. It is unclear to what extent these empirical models are generalizable to a very different organism, such as HIV-1-the most extensively sequenced organism in existence. We developed a maximum likelihood model fitting procedure to a collection of HIV-1 alignments sampled from different viral genes, and inferred two empirical substitution models, suitable for describing between-and within-host evolution. Our procedure pools the information from multiple sequence alignments, and provided software implementation can be run efficiently in parallel on a computer cluster. We describe how the inferred substitution models can be used to generate scoring matrices suitable for alignment and similarity searches. Our models had a consistently superior fit relative to the best existing models and to parameter-rich data-driven models when benchmarked on independent HIV-1 alignments, demonstrating evolutionary biases in amino-acid substitution that are unique to HIV, and that are not captured by the existing models. The scoring matrices derived from the models showed a marked difference from common amino-acid scoring matrices. The use of an appropriate evolutionary model recovered a known viral transmission history, whereas a poorly chosen model introduced phylogenetic error. We argue that our model derivation procedure is immediately applicable to other organisms with extensive sequence data available, such as Hepatitis C and Influenza A viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2035534690,"Androgen receptor (AR) functions as a transcriptional factor for genes involved in proliferation and differentiation of normal and cancerous prostate cells. Coactivators that bind to AR are required for maximal androgen action. Here we report that increasing the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in a prostate cancer cell line by as little as 1.8-fold enhances transcriptional activity of AR (but not the transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid receptor or estrogen receptor α) in a ligand-dependent manner and results in an increased expression of prostate-specific antigen. Small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of GAPDH significantly attenuated ligand-activated AR transactivation. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the presence of an endogenous protein complex containing GAPDH and AR in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Addition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to GAPDH (GAPDH-NLS) completely abolished the ability of GAPDH to transactivate AR. Neither wild-type GAPDH nor GAPDH-NLS enhanced transcriptional activity of mutant AR (ARΔC-Nuc) that is a constitutively active form of AR in the nucleus, even though GAPDH-NLS formed a complex with wild-type AR or ARΔC-Nuc. AR transactivation was enhanced by a mutant GAPDH lacking dehydrogenase activity. GAPDH enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR(T875A) activated by an antagonist such as hydroxyflutamide or cyproterone acetate. These results indicate that GAPDH functions as a coactivator with high selectivity for AR and enhances AR transactivation independent of its glycolytic activity. Further, these data suggest that formation of a GAPDH·AR complex in the cytoplasm rather than nucleus is essential for GAPDH to enhance AR transactivation.

Androgens are steroid hormones that are required for the expression of the male phenotype such as male sexual differentiation, the development and maintenance of secondary male characteristics, the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis, the maturation of normal prostate, and the development and progression of prostate cancer (1Roy A.K. Lavrovsky Y. Song C.S. Jung M.H. Velu N.K. Bi B.Y. Chatterjee B. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 309-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In mammals, virilization is mediated through two types of steroidal hormones, testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). 2The abbreviations used are: DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; AR, androgen receptor; CPA, cyproterone acetate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; DBD, DNA-binding domain; ER, estrogen receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; HF, hydroxyflutamide; LBD, ligand-binding domain; NES, nuclear export signal; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NTD, N-terminal domain; polyQ, polyglutamine; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; TPI, triosephosphate isomerase; RLU, relative light unit(s); siRNA, small interference RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; AR, androgen receptor; CPA, cyproterone acetate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; DBD, DNA-binding domain; ER, estrogen receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; HF, hydroxyflutamide; LBD, ligand-binding domain; NES, nuclear export signal; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NTD, N-terminal domain; polyQ, polyglutamine; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; TPI, triosephosphate isomerase; RLU, relative light unit(s); siRNA, small interference RNA. DHT is a more potent androgen whose action is mediated through binding to the androgen receptor (AR). The AR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which includes estrogen (ER), glucocorticoid (GR), mineralocorticoid, retinoic acid, and vitamin D receptors (2MacLean H.E. Warne G.L. Zajac J.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptors share a common modular structure that is composed of three functional domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), central DNA-binding domain (DBD) and C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Among the nuclear receptors, the primary sequence of the NTD is variable, whereas the structures of the DBD and LBD are more conserved. The ligand-independent activation function-1 and the ligand-dependent activation function-2 are located in the NTD and the LBD, respectively (3McEwan I.J. Endocrine-Related Cancer. 2004; 11: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Dehm S.M. Tindall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27882-27893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). AR, when not bound to a ligand, exists in the cytosol in an inactive state in association with chaperone proteins (e.g. heat shock proteins HSP90 and HSP70). The binding of DHT to the LBD in the AR results in conformational changes of AR, leading to dissociation of the receptor from HSPs (5Georget V. Terouanne B. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11824-11831Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The ligand-bound receptor translocates into the nucleus and binds to a specific androgen-response element in androgen-responsive genes, followed by transcriptional activation of these genes. The transcriptional activity of AR is enhanced by recruitment of coactivators (6Culig Z. Comuzzi B. Steiner H. Bartsch G. Hobisch A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 92: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Coactivators such as the ARA group (ARA70, ARA55, and ARA267-α), p300/CBP, and p160 family (SRC-1 and GRIP-1) bind to the DBD or LBD of nuclear receptors. Because these domains are conserved among members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the coactivators enhance the transcriptional activities of multiple nuclear receptors in addition to AR. In contrast, proteins that bind to the variable NTD in AR are expected to act more specifically on AR. AR contains a characteristic polyglutamine (polyQ) tract, and the expansion of the polyQ tract results in a reduction in the ability of the AR to activate transcription (8Chamberlain N.L. Driver E.D. Miesfeld R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3181-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), indicating that conformational changes of the polyQ tract per se have an influence on AR transactivation. Furthermore, ARA24 has been shown to interact with the polyQ tract of AR as a coactivator to enhance AR transactivation (9Hsiao P-W. Lin D.-L Nakao R. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20229-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). ARA24 is identical to Ran, which is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (10Weis K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These results suggest that intramolecular and/or intermolecular interactions involving the polyQ tract play a critical role in modulation of AR transactivation.Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a glycolytic enzyme that reversibly catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in the cytosol. Recent studies have demonstrated that GAPDH serves as a multifunctional protein contributing to a number of nonglycolytic cellular processes such as nuclear tRNA transport, apoptosis, DNA repair, and DNA replication in the nucleus, vesicular transport, membrane fusion and microtubule bundling in the particulate fraction (11Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), and cell spreading in the extracellular space (12Yamaji R. Chatani E. Harada N. Sugimoto K. Inui H. Nakano Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro experiments have shown that GAPDH binds to four gene products (AR, ataxin-1, atrophin, and huntingtin), each produced in a different neurodegenerative disorder (13Burke J.R. Enghild J.J. Martin M.E. Jou Y-S. Myers R.M Roses A.D Vance J.M Strittmatter W.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 14Koshy B. Matilla T. Burright E.N. Merry D.E. Fischbeck K.H. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1996; 5: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A common structural feature of these gene products is a polyQ tract. In fact, GAPDH binds to synthetic polyQ peptides, although binding of GAPDH to AR does not vary with the length of the polyQ tract. Thus, these results indicate that GAPDH interacts with AR through the polyQ tract in the NTD, although the physiological significance of the interaction between GAPDH and AR remains unclear. On the other hand, the expression level of GAPDH mRNA is correlated with the metastatic potential and cell motility of rat prostate cancer cells (15Epner D.E. Partin A.W. Schalken J.A. Isaacs J.T. Coffery D.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1995-1997PubMed Google Scholar) and increased in late pathological stages of human prostate tumors (16Rondinelli R.H. Epner D.E. Tricoli J.V. Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 1997; 1: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GAPDH regulates AR transactivation, especially when the expression of GAPDH is up-regulated in cells expressing AR. In the present study, we report that GAPDH enhances the transcriptional activity of AR in a ligand-dependent manner and that the role of GAPDH in AR transactivation is independent of glycolysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a protein complex containing GAPDH and AR exists in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—COS-7 cells and human prostate cancer PC-3 and LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere at 100% humidity unless otherwise indicated. COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and PC-3 and LNCaP cells were obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University (Miyagi, Japan).Plasmids—Human ERα mammalian expression vector, pCAGGS-ERα, was kindly provided by Dr. T.

The coding regions of the human GAPDH, AR, GR, ARA70, and ARA24/Ran cDNAs (GenBank™ accession numbers M33197, M23263, X03225, NM_005437, and NM_006325, respectively) were amplified by two-sequential, nested PCR using human brain (cerebral cortex) Marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech Laboratories, San Jose, CA) as a template and specific primer combinations, followed by cloning into pCR2.1-TOPO vectors. Primers with a typical Kozak sequence and appropriate restriction enzyme sites were designed for the second PCR. The ARA70N cDNA encoding the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–401) of ARA70 was amplified by PCR using ARA70 cDNA as a template and the specific primers. For pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His and pcDNA3.1-ARA70N-Myc-His plasmids expressing GAPDH and ANA70N with Myc and His tags at the C terminus, GAPDH and ARA70N cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites and NotI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-Myc-His, respectively. The GAPDH(C151S) cDNA encoding mutant GAPDH substituting Ser for Cys at position of 151 was amplified by PCR using specific primers and the EcoRI-digested fragments of pCR2.1-GAPDH(C151S) (12Yamaji R. Chatani E. Harada N. Sugimoto K. Inui H. Nakano Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as a template and cloned, followed by insertion into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-Myc-His, termed pcDNA3.1-GAPDH(C151S)-Myc-His. The expression vector pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-NLS-Myc-His was constructed by insertion of the DNA fragment encoding three tandem repeat of simian virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) in-frame to the BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His, resulting in a fusion protein of GAPDH with NLS, containing Myc and His tags. The GAPDH(258–261A) cDNA encoding GAPDH with a nuclear export signal (NES) containing alanine mutations was synthesized by site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), followed by construction of pcDNA3.1-GAPDH(258–261A)-Myc-His plasmid. For pcDNA3.1-AR and pcDNA3.1-GR plasmids expressing AR and GR with no tags, respectively, AR and GR cDNAs were subcloned into the NotI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-Myc-His. The AR cDNA cloned in the present study contains sequences encoding 25 repetitive polyQ and 18 repetitive polyglycine regions, and the translated protein is composed of 917 amino acids. The ARΔC-Nuc cDNA encoding mutant AR (amino acids 1–658) lacking the LBD was amplified by PCR using specific primers and the AR cDNA as a template, followed by construction of pcDNA3.1-ARΔC-Nuc. AR(T877A) substituting Ala for Thr at position of 877 of AR is found in many prostate tumors, including LNCaP cells (17Gaddipati J.P. Mcleod D.G. Heidenberg H.B. Sesterhenn I.A. Finger M.J. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2861-2864PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid position 877 of AR(T877A) corresponds to amino acid position 875 of AR cloned in the present study, because AR is polymorphic in its polyQ and polyglycine regions. Therefore, we constructed the expression vector pcDNA3.1-AR(T875A) by site-directed mutagenesis of the pcDNA3.1-AR using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. For pCAGGS-ARA24/Ran plasmid expressing ARA24/Ran with no tags, ARA24/Ran cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI sites of pCAGGS (18Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Luciferase reporter vectors (pARE2-TATA-Luc and p3xERE-TATA-Luc) in which the pGL3-basic vector has two tandem repeats of an androgen-response element and three tandem repeats of an estrogen-response element, together with an adenovirus E1b TATA sequence, were constructed according to the methods of Moilanen et al.

Cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes or 12-well plates and further cultured to 90% confluence in steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium, followed by transient transfection using Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Martinsried/Planegg, Germany). Nuclear receptor construct and its corresponding luciferase reporter construct were co-transfected into cells with GAPDH construct (pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His, pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-NLS-Myc-His, pcDNA3.1-GAPDH(258–261A)-Myc-His, or pcDNA3.1-GAPDH (C151S)-Myc-His), pcDNA3.1-ARA70N-Myc-His, or pCAGGS-ARA24/Ran. Transfection efficiency was normalized using pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase expression vector, Promega Corp., Madison, WI). After 24-h transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh, steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with specific ligand or anti-androgen, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested and lysed, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit and GloMax 20/20 Luminometer (Promega). Data are expressed as relative light units (RLU, firefly luciferase divided by Renilla luciferase). For siRNA experiments, PC-3 cells were transfected with GAPDH-specific siRNA or control siRNA (TAKARA Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) for 6 h. The medium was replaced with fresh, steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium, and cells were incubated for 18 h, followed by transient transfection with pcDNA3.1-AR, pARE2-TATA-Luc, and pRL-TK using Metafectene for 24 h.Western Blot Analysis—For detection of PSA, LNCaP cells were cultured in steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium on 35-mm dishes. When grown to 70% confluence, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His, followed by incubation for 24 h. Cells were further incubated in fresh, steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with synthetic androgen, R1881 (methyltrienolone, Dupont, Boston, MA) for 24 h.

For detection of exogenous and endogenous GAPDH and α-tubulin in reporter assay experiments, cell lysates were sonicated. The sonicated cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1/1,000) (21Yamaji R. Fujita K. Takahashi S. Yoneda H. Nagao K.

The immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Super Signal Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak BioMax XAR film. The intensity of immunoreactive proteins was quantified by densitometry using a computer image analysis program (National Institutes of Health Image, version 1.60).Immunofluorescent Microscopy—PC-3 cells that had been cultured in steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium were seeded in steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium on round coverglasses on 12-well plates. Cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His or pcDNA-GAPDH-NLS-Myc-His, followed by incubation for 24 h. Cells were further incubated in fresh, steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with R1881 for 24 h. Cells on coverglasses were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-Myc IgG (1/1000) as described previously (12Yamaji R. Chatani E. Harada N. Sugimoto K. Inui H. Nakano Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were further incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG (1/5000) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1 μg/ml) to stain nuclear chromatin, followed by inspection using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Immunoprecipitation—For preparation of whole cell fraction, LNCaP or PC-3 cells were incubated for 15 h in the presence of 0.2 nm R1881, harvested, and resuspended in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-AR or pcDNA3.1-ARΔC-Nuc and pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-NLS-Myc-His for 5 h, followed by incubation for 28 h. Cells were further incubated for 15 h in the presence of 0.2 nm R1881, followed by harvesting and resuspension in IP buffer. Cell suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is referred to as whole cell fraction. For preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, LNCaP cells were incubated for 15 h in the presence of 0.2 nm R1881 and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and homogenized by repeated passage through a 23-gauge needle. The homogenate was subjected to differential centrifugation as described previously (21Yamaji R. Fujita K. Takahashi S. Yoneda H. Nagao K. Masuda W. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Miyatake K. Inui H. Nakano Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except for minor modifications. Nuclei were sonicated in IP buffer, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant is referred to as the nuclear fraction. The post-nuclear fraction was diluted with IP buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant is referred to as the cytoplasmic fraction. The whole cell fraction (LNCaP or PC-3 cells, 1 mg; COS-7 cells, 500 μg), nuclear fraction (333 μg), or cytoplasmic fraction (1 mg) that had been precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h was incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-AR IgG (2 μg, clone AR441, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control mouse IgG (2 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 60 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) pre-equilibrated with IP buffer. The mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and the resin was washed with IP buffer. Proteins bound to the resin were analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal mouse anti-AR (1/1,000), anti-GAPDH (1/5,000, clone 6G5, Biogenesis, Poole, UK) and anti-Myc (1/3,000, clone 9B11, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) antibodies and polyclonal rabbit anti-AR antibodies (1/1,000, N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by reaction with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1/3,000) and anti-rabbit IgG (1/3,000), respectively. Immunoreactive bands were detected by Super Signal Chemiluminescent substrate.Subcellular Fractionation—PC-3 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His, pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-NLS-Myc-His, or pcDNA3.1-GAPDH(258–261A)-Myc-His using Metafectene, followed by incubation for 24 h. The medium was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested and homogenized by repeated passage in hypotonic buffer through a 23-gauge needle. The cytosolic, nuclear, and particulate fractions were separated by differential centrifugation as described previously (21Yamaji R. Fujita K. Takahashi S. Yoneda H. Nagao K. Masuda W. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Miyatake K. Inui H. Nakano Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Proteins in each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GAPDH (1/1,000), anti-triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) (1/1,000) (21Yamaji R. Fujita K. Takahashi S. Yoneda H. Nagao K. Masuda W.

Immunoreactive GAPDH or TPI, and Myc or lamin B1 were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG, respectively, followed by detection using Super Signal Chemiluminescent substrate.Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D., and Student’s t test for unpaired samples was applied for statistical analysis. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSEnhancement of AR Transactivation by GAPDH—To define the ability of GAPDH to modulate AR-mediated transcription, the human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line (an AR-negative cell line) was transiently co-transfected with the pARE2-TATA-Luc reporter plasmid, pcDNA3.1-AR and pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His, and the transcriptional activity of AR was measured as luciferase activity. The transcriptional activity of AR was increased with an increasing dosage of pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His, which resulted in an increase of recombinant GAPDH-Myc. In contrast, GAPDH had no influence on the AR transactivation in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1A). When the transcriptional activity of AR was determined at various concentrations of R1881 with PC-3 cells overexpressing GAPDH at the same level, the enhancing effect of GAPDH on AR transactivation was observed even in the presence of 0.05 nm R1881 (Fig. 1B). When similar experiments were performed in LNCaP cells (an AR-positive human prostate cancer cell line) or COS-7 cells (an AR-negative African green monkey kidney cell line), AR transactivation was enhanced by GAPDH in both cell lines (Fig. 1C). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as a biomarker for prostate cancer progression. Because PSA is an AR-mediated endogenous target gene with androgen-response elements, expression of PSA is enhanced by AR transactivation (22Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To determine whether GAPDH activates the expression of PSA, GAPDH was overexpressed in LNCaP cells, and then a cell lysate was subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-PSA antibodies. PSA was detected in the presence of R1881, and overexpression of GAPDH resulted in an increased expression level of PSA (Fig. 2). These results indicate that GAPDH enhances the transcriptional activity of AR.FIGURE 2PSA expression in GAPDH-overexpressing cells. LNCaP cells that had been cultured in steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium on 35-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-GAPDH-Myc-His or pcDNA3.1-Myc-His (empty) vector for 24 h. Cells were incubated in the presence of 0.1 nm R1881 for an additional 24 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-PSA or anti-GAPDH antibodies. The result is representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the effect of endogenous GAPDH on AR transactivation, PC-3 cells were treated with GAPDH-specific siRNA, and then the transcriptional activity of AR was determined. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GAPDH resulted in a significant decrease of ligand-induced AR transactivation (Fig. 3). Western blot analyses showed that GAPDH siRNA specifically reduced endogenous GAPDH, but not endogenous α-tubulin. These data demonstrate that endogenous GAPDH contributes to AR transactivation.FIGURE 3Effect of knockdown of endogenous GAPDH on AR transactivation. PC-3 cells that had been cultured in steroid-free RPMI 1640 medium on 12-well plates were transfected with 12 nm GAPDH siRNA or control siRNA for 6 h, followed by incubation for 18 h. Cells were further co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-AR (0.5 μg), pARE2-TATA-Luc (0.5 μg), and pRL-TK (0.05 μg) for 24 h and incubated in the presence or absence of 0.2 nm R1881 for an additional 24 h, and luciferase activities were determined. Samples used in the luciferase reporter assay were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-GAPDH or anti-α-tubulin antibodies. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and values are indicated as mean ± S.D. The result is representative of two independent experiments.

Although intense or prolonged activation of this pathway is known to induce apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms coupling stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation to the cell death machinery have remained incompletely understood. In this study, we characterized apoptosis initiation in response to classical activators of the ISR (tunicamycin, UVC, elevated osmotic pressure, arsenite). We found that all applied stress stimuli activated a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis initiation. Rapid and selective down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein MCL-1 preceded the activation of BAX, BAK, and caspases. Stabilization of MCL-1 blocked apoptosis initiation, while cells with reduced MCL-1 protein content were strongly sensitized to stress-induced apoptosis. Stress-induced elimination of MCL-1 occurred with unchanged protein turnover and independently of MCL-1 mRNA levels. In contrast, stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 was both essential and sufficient for the down-regulation of MCL-1 protein in stressed cells. These findings indicate that stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α is directly coupled to mitochondrial apoptosis regulation via translational repression of MCL-1. Down-regulation of MCL-1 enables but not enforces apoptosis initiation in stressed cells.

Phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 abrogates the function of eIF2α, required for the transfer of the initiator Met-tRNA Meti to the small ribosomal subunit. This leads to a shutdown of global mRNA translation due to reduced AUG initiator codon recognition, along with increased translation of a few selected mRNAs including ATF-4, a basic zipper transcription activator (5Holcik M.

As a consequence of global translational arrest, the steady-state levels of most cellular proteins decrease with time, dependent on their respective protein half-life. This has recently been found to be essential for NF-κB activation mediated by down-regulation of IκB proteins in response to eIF2α phosphorylation (8Jiang H.Y. Wek R.C. Biochem.

These findings provide a first striking example of a signaling pathway activated by translational repression of a labile protein during eIF2α phosphorylation. Activation of the ISR also mobilizes stress-induced gene expression induced by ATF4 and its target genes, involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (11Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H.

However, the molecular mechanisms coupling activation of the ISR to the initiation of apoptosis have remained incompletely understood. In the vast majority of cell types, apoptosis depends on the mitochondrial pathway. Therein, disruption of mitochondrial integrity leads to the release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c, AIF, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and HtrA2/Omi from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space into the cytosol (19Green D.R. Cell. 2005; 121: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c contacts Apaf-1, thereby triggering the recruitment and auto-activation of procaspase-9. Caspase-9 then activates a cascade of specialized proteases, termed executioner caspases, which in turn execute cell death. Mitochondrial integrity is regulated by the members of the BCL-2 family of proteins (20Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). BAX and BAK, two pro-apoptotic multidomain BCL-2 proteins, directly or indirectly induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) by oligomerization occurring upon their activation (21Wei M.C.

MOMP is prevented by multidomain anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1. Members of the BH3-only group of BCL-2 proteins undergo induction and/or activation by apoptotic stimuli and either directly activate BAX-BAK or specifically neutralize anti-apoptotic multidomain BCL-2 proteins (22Kim H. Rafiuddin-Shah M. Tu H.C. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to uncover the molecular cross-talk between cellular stress signaling and apoptosis. We characterized apoptosis initiation in response to classical activators of the ISR and found that stress-induced apoptosis essentially involves the rapid and selective down-regulation of MCL-1 protein, mediated by stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51. Materials—The following drugs were purchased as indicated: Coumermycin (Fluka); ZVAD-fmk (Biomol); dithiothreitol and actinomycin D (Sigma); arsenite (Merck); MG-132, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and cycloheximide (Calbiochem). Drugs were dissolved in appropriate solvent and further diluted in cell culture medium. Appropriate solvent controls and mock treatment were performed throughout the experiments. Cell Culture and Treatment—HeLa, HEK293, MiaPaCa-2, and EGI-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/l l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. DANG and TFK-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented identically. All cells were grown to a subconfluent monolayer in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For UV irradiation, culture medium was removed and cells were covered with a small volume of pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline. The lid of the cell culture dish was removed, and cells were exposed to UVC (254 nm) using a cross-linker (Stratagene). To generate osmotic stress, cells were exposed to cell culture medium supplemented with 200 mm NaCl in excess for 30 min. MG-132 and ZVAD-fmk were added to cells 30 min prior to the exposure to cellular stress. Transient and Stable Transfection—Plasmids were delivered into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were transfected at a density of 70–80% and used for experiments 24 h after transfection. For stable expression of FLAG-MCL-1 in HeLa cells, the pcDNA3.2-FLAG-MCL-1 expression plasmid was linearized prior to transfection and clones were raised in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Clones were assayed for transgene expression by Western blot analysis. MCL-1 RNA Interference—siRNA oligonucleotides specifically targeting MCL-1 were designed using the Invitrogen RNAi online design tool and synthesized by Invitrogen. Cells at a density of ∼70% were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Experiments were conducted 24 h after transfection. Target sequences of siRNA oligonucleotides were: control siRNA GCAAAGACCATTACGAAGGATCTAT; siMCL-1-1 GCATCGAACCATTAGCAGAAAGTAT; siMCL-1-2 ACGCGGTAATCGGACTCAACCTCTA. Plasmids and Cloning—MCL-1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using a cDNA library generated from HeLa cells. A FLAG tag sequence was introduced at the 5′-side of MCL-1 cDNA. pCI-neo-EGFP was generated by PCR subcloning of EGFP cDNA obtained from pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) into pCI-neo (Stratagene). pCI-neo-FLAG-eIF2α-plasmids (wt, S51A, S51D) were generated by PCR subcloning of the respective eIF2α cDNAs obtained from expression plasmids kindly provided by David Ron. A FLAG tag was introduced at the 5′-side of the respective eIF2α cDNAs. pCI-neo-GyrB.PKR and the respective inactive mutant (pCI-neo-GyrB.PKR-K296H) were generated by PCR subcloning of GyrB.PKR cDNAs obtained from expression plasmids kindly provided by Tom Dever and described elsewhere (23Ung T.L. Cao C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Integrity of all subcloned sequences was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Detailed cloning procedures and primer sequences are available on request. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture III; Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitors (17.5 mm β-glycerolphosphate and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture I, Sigma). Western blot analysis was performed as described recently (24Schneider G. Saur D. Siveke J.T. Fritsch R. Greten F.R. Schmid R.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3801-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Quantification of bands was performed from original scans using the Odyssey scanning software (Licor). Antibodies used for Western blot were: Rabbit anti-MCL-1 (Stressgen), rabbit anti-BAX (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-BAK (Upstate), mouse anti-BCL-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-BCL-xL (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma), mouse anti-PARP (Pharmingen), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), rabbit anti-P-eIF2α (Ser51) (Epitomics), rabbit anti-eIF2α (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-PKR (Cell Signaling). Immunoprecipitations for active BAK and BAX were conducted after lysis of cells in CHAPS buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 137 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% CHAPS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). 1 mg/ml protein lysate was precleared with 20 μl of A-/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. 2 μg of mouse anti-BAX 6A7 (Alexis) or mouse anti-BAK Ab-1 (Calbiochem), were added to 1 mg of cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies were precipitated with 20 μl A-/G-Sepharose for 2 h and pellets were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). Precipitated BAX or BAK were detected by immunoblot as described above. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). A DNase digestion step was included in all RNA isolation procedures to exclude DNA contamination. Specific mRNAs were quantified by real-time RT-PCR as described previously (24Schneider G. Saur D. Siveke J.T. Fritsch R. Greten F.R. Schmid R.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3801-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are available on request. For detection of FLAG-tagged mRNAs, primer pairs specifically amplifying FLAG-tagged target sequences were chosen that did not amplify the corresponding untagged mRNAs or other FLAG-tagged sequences. Number of copies mRNA were determined by using standard curves generated by serial dilutions of plasmids containing the respective target sequence. Data are shown as relative number of copies mRNA. Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Chromatin Condensation—Apoptotic nuclei were quantified by fluorescence microscopy after staining of chromatin with Hoechst 33342 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For each experiment, a minimum of 200 nuclei from three different microscopic fields were counted under blinded conditions. A Mitochondrial Pathway of Apoptosis Initiation Is Activated in Response to Classical Activators of the ISR—To study apoptosis initiation in response to activation of the ISR, HeLa cells were exposed to a number of classical ISR activators: the ER-stress inductor tunicamycin (Fig. 1A), UVC (Fig. 1B), elevated osmotic pressure (Fig. 1C) and arsenite (Fig. 1D). All stress stimuli were applied at doses found to elicit a strong apoptotic response in HeLa cells. Activation of BAX and BAK was assayed by immunoprecipitation using conformation-specific antibodies (25Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 26Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was detected by Western blot. All applied stress stimuli synchronously induced the activation of BAX and BAK as well as cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (Fig. 1, A–D, lanes 1–4). Biochemical signs of apoptosis were accompanied by characteristic morphological changes such as cytoplasmatic shrinkage and condensation of chromatin (data not shown). Parallel experiments were conducted in the presence of ZVAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. Addition of ZVAD-fmk strongly inhibited cleavage of caspase-9 and completely prevented processing of caspase-3 (Fig. 1, A–D, lanes 5–8) as well as condensation of chromatin (not shown). However, application of ZVAD-fmk did not affect the activation of BAX and BAK, indicating that BAX and BAK were activated upstream of caspases and that apoptosis was initiated at the mitochondria. Down-regulation of MCL-1 Precedes Apoptosis Initiation in Response to Cellular Stress—Mitochondrial integrity is preserved by the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family. To uncover alterations within the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic multidomain BCL-2 proteins during apoptosis initiation in response to the applied ISR activators, we performed Western blot analysis for BAX, BAK, BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1 (Fig. 1, A–D, lanes 1–4). Strikingly, all applied stress stimuli induced the rapid and selective down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein MCL-1. Down-regulation of MCL-1 preceded all further events of apoptosis initiation and was not affected by addition of ZVAD-fmk (Fig. 1, A–D, lanes 5–8). However, although the initial decrease in MCL-1 levels remained unaffected by ZVAD-fmk, reappearance of MCL-1 occurred in response to tunicamycin, osmotic stress, and arsenite when caspase activity was blocked (Fig. 1, A, C, D, lanes 5–8). Down-regulation of MCL-1 in Response to Cellular Stress Is Not Restricted to a Single Cell Type—To ensure that the rapid down-regulation of MCL-1 in response to the applied stress stimuli is not restricted to a single cell type, we exposed several cancer cell lines to tunicamycin, UVC, elevated osmotic pressure, and arsenite, and studied MCL-1 protein levels. Cell lines examined were MiaPaCa-2 and DANG pancreatic cancer cells as well as TFK-1 and EGI-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells. As shown in Fig. S1, MCL-1 was rapidly lost in response to all of the applied stresses in all cell lines tested. Stabilization of MCL-1 by Proteasome Inhibition Prevents Stress-induced Apoptosis—We next aimed to determine whether stabilizing MCL-1 under stressful conditions would alter stress-induced apoptosis. MCL-1 is a high turnover protein that is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (27Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Cell. 2005; 121: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Consequently, addition of a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132), but not adequate solvent control, completely prevented the decrease in MCL-1 levels in response to UVC, osmotic stress and arsenite (Fig. 2, A–C, compare lanes 1–4 and 5–8). Moreover, MG-132 completely blocked mitochondrial apoptosis initiation as demonstrated by absent precipitation of active BAX and non-detectable cleavage of caspase-3. Because inhibition of the proteasome affects degradation and thereby increases concentration of a myriad of proteins, we next asked whether inhibition of apoptosis by MG-132 was dependent on the observed stabilization of MCL-1. To this end, we transfected cells either with control siRNA or siRNA specifically targeting MCL-1 (siMCL-1-1, see also Fig. 3) and exposed them to the respective stresses in the presence of MG-132. As shown in Fig. 2 (A–C, compare lanes 9–12 and lanes 13–16), MG-132 blocked apoptosis initiation in controls (lanes 9–12), but not in cells with strongly reduced MCL-1 protein content (lanes 13–16). These findings indicate that stabilization of MCL-1 at pre-existing levels accounted for the blockage of apoptosis initiation in the presence of MG-132. Of note, addition of MG-132 alone did not induce apoptosis during the time course of these experiments in both controls and cells with reduced MCL-1 abundance. However, significant toxicity occurred when cells were exposed to proteasome inhibitors for longer incubation times (∼12 h). Therefore, we could not perform parallel experiments with ER-stress-inducing agents that required longer incubation times to induce apoptosis.FIGURE 3MCL-1 is a strong inhibitor of apoptosis in response to activators of the ISR. A, HeLa cells were either left untreated or were transfected with control siRNA or with each one of two different siRNAs specifically targeting MCL-1 (siMCL-1-1, siMCL-1-2). Protein lysates were assayed for MCL-1 protein content by immunoblotting 24 h after transfection. B, untreated HeLa cells (wt), and cells transfected with control siRNA or siRNA specifically targeting MCL-1 (siMCL-1-1, siMCL-1-2) were exposed to increasing doses of tunicamycin, UVC, osmotic stress, and arsenite as indicated. Cells were stained with H33342 after 4 h (UVC, osmotic stress, arsenite) or 24 h (tunicamycin). Chromatin condensation was assayed by fluorescence microscopy. C, HeLa cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA (control) or siMCL-1-1 were exposed to increasing doses of tunicamycin, UVC, osmotic stress, and arsenite as indicated. PARP cleavage was assayed by immunoblotting, β-actin served as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MCL-1 Is a Survival Factor in Response to Cellular Stress—In contrast to other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins like BCL-xL and BCL-2, MCL-1 is a short-lived protein that undergoes continuous regulation at the level of transcription, translation, and degradation (28Michels J. Johnson P.W. Packham G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We therefore aimed to determine whether alterations in MCL-1 protein levels would affect the cellular response to the applied ISR activators. To this end, we modified MCL-1 protein expression through RNA interference and conducted dose-response experiments. In these experiments, apoptosis was assayed by quantification of chromatin condensation (Fig. 3B) and immunoblotting for PARP cleavage (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3A demonstrates efficient knockdown of MCL-1 protein after transfection of cells with two different siRNAs (siMCL-1-1, siMCL-1-2) specifically targeting MCL-1. In line with findings reported by others (29Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), down-regulation of MCL-1 protein alone was not sufficient to induce cell death (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, cells with reduced MCL-1 protein levels proliferated normally and exhibited no gross morphological changes (data not shown). However, cells with reduced MCL-1 protein expression levels were strongly sensitized to the applied stress stimuli and underwent apoptosis in response to very mild stress conditions (Fig. 3, B and C). These findings indicate that MCL-1 protein levels determine apoptosis sensitivity under stressful conditions. Cellular Stress Does Not Affect MCL-1 Protein Turnover—We next asked for the molecular mechanisms mediating down-regulation of MCL-1 in response to the applied activators of the ISR. Throughout these experiments, the more rapidly acting ER-stress inducing drug thapsigargin was used instead of tunicamycin. As shown in Fig. 4A, elimination of MCL-1 in response to the applied stresses occurred very rapidly. To determine whether this was due to an increase in MCL-1 protein turnover, the kinetics of MCL-1 protein degradation were uncovered by treating cells with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. At the same time, cells were exposed either to mock treatment (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–4) or to stress stimuli as indicated (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8). Addition of cycloheximide uncovered a short constitutive MCL-1 protein half-life of ∼30 min in HeLa cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–4). Notably, none of the applied stresses further accelerated the disappearance of MCL-1 protein when compared with mock treatment (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 5–8 and 1–4). These findings suggest that the rapid decrease in MCL-1 levels in response to cellular stress is not mediated by enhanced MCL-1 protein degradation. Different Types of Stress Exhibit Different Effects on MCL-1 mRNA—We next studied MCL-1 mRNA behavior in response to the applied stress stimuli. As shown in Fig. 4C, no uniform effect on MCL-1 mRNA was observed. Exposure of cells to UV light induced a rapid and sustained loss of MCL-1 mRNA, while osmotic stress elicited a more transient decline in MCL-1 mRNA levels, followed by an increase above baseline levels (Fig. 4C, left diagram). Arsenite did not significantly affect MCL-1 mRNA abundance, whereas thapsigargin induced a slight but steady increase in MCL-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 4C, right diagram). Virtually identical results were obtained in parallel experiments performed with MiaPaCa-2 cells (data not shown). UV-induced MCL-1 mRNA Degradation Is Dispensable for UV-induced Down-regulation of MCL-1 Protein—The rapid decrease of MCL-1 mRNA in response to UVC paralleled the kinetics of MCL-1 protein disappearance. To determine whether UV-induced down-regulation of MCL-1 mRNA was required for the down-regulation of MCL-1 protein, we further characterized UV-induced loss of MCL-1 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 5A, UVC induced a dose-dependent decline in MCL-1 mRNA levels. Treatment of cells with actinomycin D to block novel mRNA synthesis uncovered a MCL-1 mRNA half-life of ∼2 h (Fig. 5B). Exposure of actinomycin D-treated cells to UVC strongly enhanced MCL-1 mRNA decay, followed by a stabilization of the remaining pool (Fig. 5B), indicating that UV light interfered with MCL-1 mRNA stability. Regulation of mRNA stability during cellular stress has been found to depend on regulatory elements located within the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs (30Kedersha N. Anderson P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether transgenic MCL-1 mRNA devoid of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions would undergo UV-induced degradation. Two independent HeLa cell clones (37 and 9) raised after stable transfection with pcDNA-3.2-FLAG-MCL-1 were exposed to UV light and both mRNA (Fig. 5C) and protein (Fig. 5D) levels of FLAG-tagged MCL-1 and endogenous MCL-1 were studied. As shown in Fig. 5C, endogenous MCL-1 mRNA was rapidly down-regulated in response to UVC, while FLAG-MCL-1 mRNA remained largely unaffected. However, at protein level, both FLAG-tagged MCL-1 and endogenous MCL-1 protein were eliminated with identical kinetics (Fig. 5D), indicating that the down-regulation of MCL-1 protein occurred independently of MCL-1 mRNA behavior. In summary, all of the applied stresses affected MCL-1 protein abundance downstream of MCL-1 mRNA levels, and upstream of MCL-1 protein degradation, suggesting blockage at the level of mRNA translation. Phosphorylation of eIF2α Parallels the Suppression of MCL-1 Protein—Manifold stresses have been shown to induce global translational arrest by inducing the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) at Ser51, leading to decreased formation of the ternary complex required for the binding of Met-tRNA Meti to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (5Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). To determine whether stress-induced down-regulation of MCL-1 was related to eIF2α phosphorylation, the kinetics of eIF2α phosphorylation and MCL-1 down-regulation were studied in parallel. As shown in Fig. 6, all of the applied stresses induced a strong phosphorylation of eIF2α that was temporally paralleled by the down-regulation of MCL-1. In detail, exp"
https://openalex.org/W1988233697,"Background As of late, dopaminergic neurotransmission has been recognized to be involved in the generation of sleep disturbances. Increasing evidence shows that sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are mostly related to the disease itself, rather than being a secondary phenomenon. Evidence contained in the literature lends support to the hypothesis that the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway is closely involved in the regulation of sleep patterns. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this hypothesis we examined the electrophysiological activity along the sleep-wake cycle of rats submitted to a surgically induced lesion of the SNpc by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We demonstrated that a 50% lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) suffices to produce disruptions of several parameters in the sleep-wake pattern of rats. A robust and constant decrease in the latency to the onset of slow wave sleep (SWS) was detected throughout the five days of recording in both light [F(22.16) = 72.46, p<0.0001] and dark [F(22.16) = 75.0, p<0.0001] periods. Also found was a pronounced increase in the percentage of sleep efficiency during the first four days of recording [F(21.15) = 21.48, p<0.0001], in comparison to the sham group. Additionally, the reduction in the SNpc dopaminergic neurons provoked an ablation in the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) during three days of the sleep-wake recording period with a strong correlation (r = 0.91; p<0.0001) between the number of dopaminergic neurons lost and the percentage decrease of REM sleep on the first day of recording. On day 4, the percentage of REM sleep during the light and dark periods was increased, [F(22.16) = 2.46, p<0.0007], a phenomenon consistent with REM rebound. Conclusions/Significance We propose that dopaminergic neurons present in the SNpc possess a fundamental function in the regulation of sleep processes, particularly in promoting REM sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2093259035,"Organic anion transporters (OATs, SLC22) interact with a remarkably diverse array of endogenous and exogenous organic anions. However, little is known about the structural features that determine their substrate selectivity. We examined the substrate binding preferences and transport function of olfactory organic anion transporter, Oat6, in comparison with the more broadly expressed transporter, Oat1 (first identified as NKT). In analyzing interactions of both transporters with over 40 structurally diverse organic anions, we find a correlation between organic anion potency (pKi) and hydrophobicity (logP) suggesting a hydrophobicity-driven association with transporter-binding sites, which appears particularly prominent for Oat6. On the other hand, organic anion binding selectivity between Oat6 and Oat1 is influenced by the anion mass and net charge. Smaller mono-anions manifest greater potency for Oat6 and di-anions for Oat1. Comparative molecular field analysis confirms these mechanistic insights and provides a model for predicting new OAT substrates. By comparative molecular field analysis, both hydrophobic and charged interactions contribute to Oat1 binding, although it is predominantly the former that contributes to Oat6 binding. Together, the data suggest that, although the three-dimensional structures of these two transporters may be very similar, the binding pockets exhibit crucial differences. Furthermore, for six radiolabeled substrates, we assessed transport efficacy (Vmax) for Oat6 and Oat1. Binding potency and transport efficacy had little correlation, suggesting that different molecular interactions are involved in substrate binding to the transporter and translocation across the membrane. Substrate specificity for a particular transporter may enable design of drugs for targeting to specific tissues (e.g. olfactory mucosa). We also discuss how these data suggest a possible mechanism for remote sensing between OATs in different tissue compartments (e.g. kidney, olfactory mucosa) via organic anions."

Tim9 and Tim10 are small cysteine-rich proteins that are synthesized as noncleavable precursors on cytosolic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria. Analysis of the biogenesis of the Tim9 and Tim10 precursors led to the identification of a novel machinery, termed the mitochondrial IMS import and assembly machinery (MIA) (24Chacinska A.

Mia40 and Erv1 form a protein relay for disulfide formation in IMS precursor proteins by transferring disulfides from Erv1 via Mia40 to the substrate proteins (30Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C.

However, Mia40 is not homologous to bacterial or endoplasmic reticulum proteins and performs a novel function by driving protein translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane (24Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Schulze-Specking A Truscott K.N. Guiard B Meisinger C Pfanner N.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of protein targeting to Mia40 has not been elucidated. It is unknown whether Mia40 generally interacts with cysteine-rich proteins or specifically recognizes IMS-destined proteins. For this study, we dissected the mitochondrial import steps of the precursors of Tim9 and Tim10 and analyzed the role of individual cysteine residues of the precursors in translocation across the outer membrane, binding to Mia40 and assembly into the Tim9–Tim10 chaperone complex. We report that the cysteine residues play different roles in membrane translocation and oligomeric assembly. Translocation across the outer membrane is coupled to binding to Mia40, a process that depends on one defined cysteine residue of each precursor. Mia40 distinguishes between different cysteine residues of a precursor protein in a site-specific manner in vitro and in organello. Our findings suggest that Mia40 functions as a receptor that binds precursors via transient disulfide bonds, thereby promoting substrate entry into the IMS-specific pathway and initiating the subsequent assembly process. Yeast Strains and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa, ade2-101, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63, lys2-801) was used as wild type (43Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

The mutant strains mia40-4 (MATa, ade2-101, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63, lys2-801, mia40::ADE2 (pFL39-FOMP2–7ts/mia40-4)) and erv1-2 (YBG-0702b; MATa, ade2-101, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63, lys2-801, erv1::ADE2 (pFL39-ERV1–2ts)) were reported previously (24Chacinska A.

The mutant strain erv1-3 (YBG-0701a; MATa, ade2-101, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63, lys2-801, erv1::ADE2 (pFL39-ERV1–1ts)) was generated by error-prone PCR and plasmid shuffling according to a published procedure (44Truscott K.N.

Yeast strains were grown at 19 or 30 °C in medium containing 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone, and 3% (v/v) glycerol (YPG). Isolation of Mitochondria—S. cerevisiae mutant strains and the corresponding wild-type strain were grown in parallel in YPG medium to an A600 nm of ∼1.5. After cell disruption by Zymolyase treatment and homogenization, mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation according to a standard procedure (45Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Truscott K.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of mitochondria was adjusted to 10 mg of protein/ml in SM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2). Generation of Tim9 and Tim10 Cysteine Mutants—Single, double, and quadruple cysteine to serine mutants of Tim9 and Tim10 were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit) from pGEM-4Z-based plasmids containing the cloned gene of interest. Primer design and PCR were performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The mutations were verified by sequencing (GATC Biotech). Protein Import into Mitochondria—35S-Labeled precursor proteins were synthesized using the TnT SP6 coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega) or reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine (GE Healthcare). After denaturation in urea buffer (8 m urea, 30 mm MOPS, 50 mm DTT, pH 7.2), 35S-labeled precursors (2% volume of import assay) were incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria (50–100 μg of protein) at 30 (for Tim9) and 35 °C (for Tim10) in import buffer (3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, 5 mm methionine, 5–10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2). Import reactions were stopped by placing samples on ice. Where indicated samples were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K. Samples were subsequently washed with SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2). Mitochondria were reisolated and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (for SDS-PAGE) or digitonin solubilization buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) for blue native electrophoresis (24Chacinska A.

Reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE or blue native electrophoresis and analyzed by digital phosphorimager autoradiography (GE Healthcare). To generate mitoplasts, mitochondria were exposed to hypo-osmotic swelling in EM buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) prior to the import reactions. Affinity Purification of Mia40-His10—35S-Labeled wild-type Tim9 was imported into mitochondria carrying a carboxyl-terminal His10-tagged version of Mia40 (31Rissler M. Wiedemann N. Pfannschmidt S. Gabriel K. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in YPH499 background. The mitochondria were lysed with 1% digitonin solubilization buffer containing 50 mm iodoacetamide and subjected to Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography. After washing of the column, protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole, 50 mm iodoacetamide, pH 7.4). Proteins were separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and analyzed by digital autoradiography and Western blotting with Mia40-specific antibodies. Purification of Mia40 Expressed in Escherichia coli—A fragment of DNA encoding a factor Xa cleavage site followed by Mia40 beginning at residue 95 was cloned into pET10N (47Truscott K.N. Kovermann P.

The resulting plasmid pN-10His-Mia40-(1–94Δ) was sequenced and transformed into the E. coli strain BL21. After growth to an A600 nm of 0.5, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression. After growth for a further 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mg/ml RNase A, 5 mg/ml DNase I, pH 8.0), and exposed to sonication on ice. Cell lysates were spun at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant fraction was used for Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. After washing with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, adjusted to pH 8.0), Mia40 was either eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 250 mm imidazole, 50 mm iodoacetamide, pH 8.0) or factor Xa protease as per the manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs). In Vitro Binding of Proteins to Mia40—Purified Mia40 (column-immobilized or factor Xa-released) was incubated with 35S-labeled proteins in binding buffer (250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm methionine, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) at 4–30 °C for 4–10 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 50 mm. Fractions bound to Ni-NTA columns were washed with washing buffer (30 mm imidazole, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm methionine, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2), eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Binding of precursors to the factor Xa-cleaved Mia40 was analyzed directly by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, followed by digital phosphorimager autoradiography (GE Healthcare). Cysteine Residues Are Critical for the Biogenesis Pathway of Tim9—We used blue native electrophoresis to study the import and assembly of radiolabeled Tim9 into isolated yeast mitochondria. The native gel assay of digitonin-lysed mitochondria not only separates the two mature Tim9-containing complexes Tim9–Tim10 and TIM22 but also an import intermediate of Tim9 bound to Mia40 (Fig. 1A, lane 1) (24Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Schulze-Specking A Truscott K.N. Guiard B Meisinger C Pfanner N.

Biol. 2005; 353: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The addition of the SH-modifying reagents N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide blocked the import of Tim9 and its association with Mia40 (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that cysteine residues are crucial for formation of the Mia40 intermediate. Mature Tim9 possesses two intramolecular disulfide bonds, one formed by the two outer cysteines (Cys-35 and Cys-59) and the other formed by the two inner cysteines (Cys-39 and Cys-55) (19Webb C.T. Gorman M.A. Lazarou M. Ryan M.T. Gulbis J.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Allen S. Lu H. Thornton D. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38505-38513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We asked if and which of the cysteine residues are required for the import pathway of Tim9. First, we replaced all four cysteine residues with serine residues (Fig. 1B). The resulting modified Tim9 precursor was not imported into mitochondria (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3) (the amount of radiolabeled precursor proteins added to the import reaction was similar for each construct). Second, we generated constructs that retained two cysteines, respectively, corresponding to the disulfides formed in mature assembled Tim9. Upon replacement of the two outer cysteine residues with serine residues, the import and assembly of Tim9 was blocked (Fig. 1D, lanes 4–6). When the two inner cysteine residues were replaced, however, a partial import reaction was observed. Assembly to the mature Tim9–Tim10 and TIM22 complexes did not occur, but the precursor was able to form the Mia40 intermediate (Fig. 1D, lanes 7–9). To obtain independent evidence for the interaction of Tim9 precursors with Mia40, we used denaturing electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under nonreducing conditions to preserve disulfide bonds. Radiolabeled Tim9 formed a high molecular mass product in wild-type mitochondria that showed a slower gel mobility in mitochondria containing Mia40 with a deca-histidine tag (Fig. 1E, lanes 1 and 2). Upon purification of Mia40His10 by affinity chromatography, the high molecular mass product was copurified (Fig. 1E, lane 6), demonstrating that the product contained Tim9 and Mia40. In agreement with the native gel assay, formation of the Tim9-Mia40 product was inhibited when the Tim9 precursor with replaced outer cysteine residues was used, whereas the Tim9 precursor with replacement of the two inner cysteine residues formed the Tim9-Mia40 intermediate (Fig. 1F). To study the translocation of Tim9 across the outer mitochondrial membrane, we used a protease protection assay (24Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Schulze-Specking A Truscott K.N. Guiard B Meisinger C Pfanner N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3735-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). After the import reaction, the mitochondria were treated with proteinase K to remove nonimported precursor. The mitochondria were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and thus all imported Tim9 molecules migrated in monomeric form (Fig. 1G). Tim9 with replaced outer cysteines was strongly inhibited in translocation to a protease-protected location, whereas Tim9 with replaced inner cysteines was imported. Thus, the result of the protease protection assay (Fig. 1G) correlated well with formation of the Mia40 intermediate (Fig. 1, D and F), whereas generation of the mature Tim9–Tim10 and TIM22 complexes was blocked with each mutant Tim9 precursor (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that the cysteine residues of Tim9 are required at various stages of the import and assembly pathway. Differential Requirement of Cysteine Residues in Targeting and Assembly of Tim9—We asked whether both outer cysteine residues of Tim9 (Cys-35 and Cys-59) were required for translocation across the outer membrane and binding to Mia40. We thus replaced each individual cysteine residue of Tim9 with a serine residue. Each mutant precursor could not form the mature Tim9–Tim10 and TIM22 complexes (Fig. 2A). However, only the first cysteine residue Cys-35 was critical for efficient binding of the precursor to Mia40 (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6), whereas replacement of any of the other three cysteine residues did not impair formation of the Mia40 intermediate or even enhanced it (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–15). We treated mitochondria with proteinase K after the import reaction to determine whether the mutant precursors were translocated across the outer membrane. Indeed, only replacement of the first cysteine residue impaired translocation of Tim9 into mitochondria, whereas the three other mutant precursors were imported with wild-type efficiency (Fig. 2B). A point of concern was the possibility that the replacement of cysteine residues may have resulted in misfolding or aggregation of the Tim9 precursor. Such events could alter the import competency of precursor proteins. To exclude premature folding, the precursor proteins used in this study were unfolded in 8 m urea in the presence of the reductant dithiothreitol (DTT) before the import reaction. (Additionally we observed that precursor proteins that were directly imported from reticulocyte lysates not exposed to a denaturing treatment showed the same site-specific dependence on cysteine residues as the urea unfolded precursors, indicating that misfolding of the precursors did not occur under our import conditions (data not shown).) We conclude that the first cysteine residue of Tim9 is critical for efficient binding of the precursor to Mia40, as well as translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane. In contrast to the first cysteine residue, replacement of the third cysteine residue (C55S) led to an increased yield of the Tim9-Mia40 intermediate (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6 versus 10–12). These two precursors were selected for a detailed analysis. The interaction of both mutant precursors with Mia40 was largely dissociated by addition of DTT like the wild-type Tim9 precursor (Fig. 2C), indicating that formation of the Tim9-Mia40 complex required a covalent linkage via disulfide bridges with each precursor. We asked if the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 was required for the increased yield of Mia40-bound Tim9C55S. We used yeast mutants of ERV1 that block the formation of mature Tim9–Tim10 and TIM22 complexes, whereas the initial binding to Mia40 is still possible in case of the wild-type Tim9 precursor (Fig. 2D, lanes 4–9) (31Rissler M. Wiedemann N. Pfannschmidt S. Gabriel K. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The enhanced accumulation of Tim9C55S at Mia40 was largely prevented in both erv1 mutant mitochondria (Fig. 2D, lanes 13–18 compared with lanes 10–12). We conclude that the mutant precursor can still bind to Mia40 in erv1 mutant mitochondria (albeit with reduced efficiency i"

Scanning electron and confocal microscopy revealed that the NMP-treated membranes contained: (i) large microcavities of 80-120 microm in diameter and 40-100 microm in depth, which we termed primary; and (ii) smaller microcavities of 10-20 microm in diameter and 3-10 microm in depth located within the primary cavities, which we termed secondary. We asked whether a microcavity-rich scaffold had distinct bone-forming capabilities compared to a smooth one. To do so, mesenchymal stem cells derived from human dental pulp were seeded onto the two types of scaffold and monitored over time for cytoarchitectural characteristics, differentiation status and production of important factors, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We found that the microcavity-rich scaffold enhanced cell adhesion: the cells created intimate contact with secondary microcavities and were polarized. These cytological responses were not seen with the smooth-surface scaffold. Moreover, cells on the microcavity-rich scaffold released larger amounts of BMP-2 and VEGF into the culture medium and expressed higher alkaline phosphatase activity. When this type of scaffold was transplanted into rats, superior bone formation was elicited compared to cells seeded on the smooth scaffold.In conclusion, surface microcavities appear to support a more vigorous osteogenic response of stem cells and should be used in the design of therapeutic substrates to improve bone repair and bioengineering applications in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2013403013,"Light is the most potent stimulus for synchronizing endogenous circadian rhythms with external time. Photic clock resetting in mammals involves cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcriptional activation of Period clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Here we provide evidence for an additional photic input pathway to the mammalian circadian clock based on Protein Kinase C alpha (PRKCA). We found that Prkca-deficient mice show an impairment of light-mediated clock resetting. In the SCN of wild-type mice, light exposure evokes a transient interaction between PRKCA and PERIOD 2 (PER2) proteins that affects PER2 stability and nucleocytoplasmic distribution. These posttranslational events, together with CREB-mediated transcriptional regulation, are key factors in the molecular mechanism of photic clock resetting."
https://openalex.org/W2135098955,"Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most prevalent congenital infection worldwide. Epidemiology and clinical outcomes are known to vary with socio-economic background, but few data are available from developing countries, where the overall burden of infectious diseases is frequently high.As part of an ongoing birth cohort study in The Gambia among term infants, urine samples were collected at birth and tested by PCR for the presence of CMV DNA. Risk factors for transmission and clinical outcome were assessed, including placental malaria infection. Babies were followed up at home monthly for morbidity and anthropometry, and at one year of age a clinical evaluation was performed. The prevalence of congenital CMV infection was 5.4% (40/741). A higher prevalence of hepatomegaly was the only significant clinical difference at birth. Congenitally infected children were more often first born babies (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-13.7), more frequently born in crowded compounds (adjusted OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.0-8.3) and active placental malaria was more prevalent (adjusted OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.0-8.4). These associations were corrected for maternal age, bed net use and season of birth. During the first year of follow up, mothers of congenitally infected children reported more health complaints for their child.In this study, the prevalence of congenital CMV among healthy neonates was much higher than previously reported in industrialised countries, and was associated with active placental malaria infection. There were no obvious clinical implications during the first year of life. The effect of early life CMV on the developing infant in the Gambia could be mitigated by environmental factors, such as the high burden of other infections."
https://openalex.org/W1988205526,"The atheroprotective role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is well established. During inflammation, expression of apoE in macrophages is reduced leading to enhanced atheromatous plaque development. In the present study, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the repression of apoE gene expression in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, a condition that mimics the inflammatory stress, in mouse macrophages RAW 264.7. We identified Tpl-2 and MEKK1 as the kinases that are primarily responsible for the down-regulation of apoE promoter activity by LPS. Using a dominant negative form of IκB, we established that Tpl-2 and MEKK1 signaling pathways converge to NF-κB acting on the apoE core promoter –55/+73. In addition to NF-κB activation, LPS also activated c-Jun via its phosphorylation by JNK. The activity of the apoE promoter was repressed by c-Jun, whereas small interference RNA-mediated inhibition of endogenous c-Jun expression reversed the inhibitory effect of Tpl-2 on the apoE promoter. Transfection experiments and DNA binding assays showed that the binding site for c-Jun is in the –55/+73 region of the apoE promoter. Finally, we showed that LPS inhibited apoE gene expression via activation of the Tpl-2/MEK/ERK pathway acting on a different apoE promoter region. In summary, LPS represses apoE gene expression in macrophages via signaling pathways that involve the upstream kinases Tpl-2 and MEKK1, the intermediate mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and JNK, and the downstream transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB that inhibit the apoE promoter activity via distinct regions.

Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). As a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor family, apoE scavenges lipoprotein remnants and mediates clearance of apoE-rich large high density lipoprotein particles from the serum, a significant determinant of the redistribution of cholesterol and triglycerides between the peripheral tissues and the liver. ApoE is mainly synthesized by the liver, kidney, lung, spleen, skin, brain, and various cells such as macrophages (2Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ApoE production is of particular significance at sites endangered by the uptake of lipoproteins, such as the atheromatous plaques. The protective role of apoE in atherosclerosis was recognized in apoE knockout mice, which is a well established animal model for atherogenesis (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the level of atheromas, macrophages are the primary providers of apoE. This was elegantly demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing apoE only in macrophages, which were protected from atherosclerosis, even though the plasma levels of apoE were exceedingly low and the animals were hypercholesterolemic (4Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L. Taylor J.M. Pitas R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Consistently, transgenic mice with normal levels of plasma apoE and apoE-null macrophages were more susceptible to atherosclerosis (5Fazio S. Babaev V.R. Murray A.B. Hasty A.H. Carter K.J. Gleaves L.A. Atkinson J.B. Linton M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4647-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ApoE secretion by macrophages within the atherosclerotic plaque facilitates efflux of cholesterol to exogenous acceptors (such as high density lipoprotein), assisting reversal of cholesterol transport to the liver. The human apoE gene is 3.6 kb in length and is located on chromosome 19, at the 5′-end of the apoE/apoCI/apoCIV/apo-CII gene cluster (6Olaisen B. Teisberg P. Gedde-Dahl Jr., T. Hum Genet. 1982; 62: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of apoE requires the aggregation of several transcription factors on the proximal promoter. Several positive and negative elements have been detected on the apoE promoter (7Smith J.D. Melian A. Leff T. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8300-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the AP-2 and Zic1/Zic2 sites and the non-canonical E-box, which are important regulatory elements within the proximal apoE promoter in astrocytes (8Garcia M.A. Vazquez J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1881-1888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transcription factors that drive the apoE expression in macrophages are not fully identified. Currently, there is a general agreement that atherogenesis entails both a lipid disorder and an inflammatory process. The prominent role of inflammation in atherosclerosis (11Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6973) Google Scholar) requires further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms at the level of the atherosclerotic plaque, which may lead to novel or more complex anti-inflammatory therapeutic targets. The aim of this study was to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that control apoE promoter activity in macrophages in response to inflammatory signals. To mimic the inflammatory state, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which activates numerous signal transduction cascades, including the NF-κB-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines (12Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We report here that LPS represses apoE gene expression in macrophages. The mechanism involves Toll-like receptor-4-mediated activation of the upstream kinases Tpl-2 and MEKK1, activation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB, and AP-1 transcription factors that act directly on the apoE promoter. Materials—Restriction and modification enzymes (T4 ligase, DNA polymerase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase) were purchased from Invitrogen or Promega (Madison, WI). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen, Titan™ One Tube RT-PCR System was from Roche Applied Science, ECL Western blotting kit was from Pierce, Luciferase assay system was from Promega, and all other reagents were from Sigma. The primers were obtained from Invitrogen; siRNA for human c-Jun and all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmid Constructions—The apoE proximal promoter (–500/+73) was cloned in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) that contains as a reporter the promoterless luciferase (luc) gene. Briefly, the promoter sequence –500/+302 was amplified by PCR using the following primers: F, 5′-TTTGGTACCGCTGGTCTCAAACTCCTACCTTAAGTGATTCG-3′; R, 5′-TTTAAGCTTAACTCGTGGAGTCCTGCTATGGCTTACATCCC-3′. After amplification, the DNA fragments were digested with KpnI and SacI (the apoE gene contains a SacI site at +73) and cloned in the pGL3-basic vector, obtaining the plasmid (–500/+73) apoE-luc. The deletion mutants of the apoE promoter were obtained by PCR employing the following forward primers: F-100, 5′-GGGGTACCACCTCGTGACTGGGGGCTG; F-55, 5′-GGGGTACCGGGGGCGGGACAGGGGGAG-3′. The reverse primer used was R + 73 (5′-AAGAGCTCATCCCCGTGCCCCCG-3′). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with KpnI and SacI and cloned in the pGL3 vector, obtaining the plasmids (–100/+73) apoE-luc and (–55/+73) apoE-luc. The p(κB)3-luc contains three copies of a NF-κB site cloned upstream of the minimal SV40 promoter and the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-Promoter (Promega). The expression vectors for Tpl-2, Tpl-2DN, MEKK1, and MEK1 were a generous gift of Dr. Christos Tsatsanis (University of Crete Medical School, Heraklion, Greece). The expression vectors for IKKβ, p50/p65, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD have been described previously (13Prokova V. Mosialos G. Kardassis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9342-9350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-295781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The expression vector for ERK2 was a generous gift of Dr. Didier Picard (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Cell Culture—Mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) were isolated as previously described (15Agelaki S. Tsatsanis C. Gravanis A. Margioris A.N. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5-ml aliquot of 4% thioglycolate solution was injected intraperitoneally in BALB/c mice, and peritoneal macrophages were isolated by lavage of the peritoneal cavity with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. MPM, RAW 264.7, and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. One day prior to transfection, RAW 264.7 cells were mechanically detached from the culture dish (employing a cell lifter) and plated in 6-well culture plates (0.8 × 106 cells/well). Monocytes U937 and THP-1 cell lines were grown in RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and RT-PCR was performed in a single step employing a Roche Applied Science kit and the following specific primers: human apoE forward, 5′-CCAGCGGAGGTGAAGGAC; human apoE reverse, 5′-CGCTTCTGCAG GTCATCG; mouse apoE forward, 5′-ACAGATCAGCTCGAGTGGCAAA; mouse apoE reverse, 5′-ATCTTGCGCAGGTGTGTGGAGA; GAPDH forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC; and GAPDH reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA. The fragments obtained by RT-PCR were of 584 bp for human apoE, 389 bp for mouse apoE, and 451 bp for GAPDH. Transient Transfections—Transient transfections were performed by the Ca3(PO4)2 coprecipitation method (15Agelaki S. Tsatsanis C. Gravanis A. Margioris A.N. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated for 18 h with 1 μg/ml LPS, alone or together with inhibitors (10 μm U0126, 10 μm cyclosporine, 10 nm PMA). Forty hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and subsequently lysed in the buffer included in the luciferase assay kit (Promega) followed by a freeze-thaw cycle and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay kit from Promega (as indicated by the manufacturer). The activity of β-galactosidase was determined using o-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside. DNA Pulldown Assay—DNA fragments of the apoE promoter were biotinylated by PCR, using the corresponding apoE-luc plasmids as templates and the primers described for cloning except that the reverse primer (R + 73) was biotinylated at the 5′-end. In other experiments, biotinylated forward primer RVprimer3 (5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC, Promega), and R + 73 unbiotinylated were employed. In this case, the amplified product contained a fragment of 58 bp corresponding to the pGL3-basic vector. Biotinylated DNA was coupled to the Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, biotinylated DNA was incubated with Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin for 15 min at room temperature in B&W buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl) in a slight excess of DNA. After coupling, the beads were washed twice with B&W buffer to remove the unbound DNA and once with the binding buffer (see below). When RV3 primer was used, after immobilization of the DNA on Dynabeads, half of the total amount of the beads was treated with KpnI, to remove the (–55/+73) apoE fragment; the beads containing the 58 bp from pGL3 vector were used as negative control for the DNA binding assay. Nuclear extracts were purified as previously described (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar); these extracts were incubated with the biotinylated DNA immobilized on Dynabeads for 90 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, with 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm zinc acetate, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). The complexes formed were isolated with Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin, washed with binding buffer, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, using anti-p50 or anti c-Jun antibodies. The blots were developed using an ECL kit from Pierce. Immunoblotting—RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS for various time intervals were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and solubilized in Laemmli buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the blots were tested with the following antibodies: anti-ERK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-SAPK, anti-c-Jun, anti-phospho c-Jun, and anti-p50. In other experiments, LPS-treated cells were subjected to hypo-osmotic lysis using 7 mm phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm benzamidine). The cell homogenate was passed 10 times through a syringe needle (24-gauge) and then centrifuged 10 min at 750 × g. The pellet containing the nuclear fraction was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in Laemmli buffer. The proteins from the supernatant, considered the cytoplasmic fraction, were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (12% final concentration) and solubilized in Laemmli buffer. The protein concentration was determined using Amido Black (17Sheffield J.B. Graff D. Li H.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). From each sample, aliquots of 30 μg of protein were subjected to Western blot using the polyclonal antibodies anti-p50 and anti-c-Jun, followed by the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, which were revealed using an ECL kit (Pierce). The bands were quantified by densitometry using the Total Lab software (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—Values in the text are means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was performed using OriginPro 7.5. For p values <0.05, the population means are statistically different. LPS Induces ApoE Gene Expression in Monocytes and Inhibits ApoE Gene Expression in Macrophages—To determine the effect of bacterial LPS on the expression of apoE in monocytes and macrophages, we employed two monocytic cell lines (U937 and THP-1), a macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7), and thioglycollate-elicited MPMs. The cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 18 h, and apoE expression was determined by RT-PCR. The results showed a differential modulation of apoE by LPS in monocytes and macrophages. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, apoE is expressed in both monocytic cell lines only in the presence of LPS. By contrast, this treatment decreased the basal levels of apoE mRNA in macrophage cell line by 30%, and in mouse peritoneal macrophages by 48%. Semiquantitative evaluation of the products obtained by RT-PCR showed a dose-dependent repression of apoE in RAW264.7 cells by LPS treatment (for 18 h). As compared with the control, the repression induced by LPS was statistically significant (p < 0.035, Fig. 1B). Inhibition of ApoE Gene Expression by LPS Involves Kinases Tpl-2 and MEKK1—To investigate the mechanism of apoE gene repression by LPS, the apoE proximal promoter (–500/+73) was cloned in front of the promoterless luc gene in the pGL3 basic vector. Determination of luciferase activity in transiently transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages revealed that LPS decreased drastically the activity of apoE promoter to 15 ± 12% of the control value (p < 0.015, Fig. 2A). Next, we focused on the characterization of the signaling pathways activated by LPS (downstream the Toll-like receptors) and searched for the exact region(s) of the apoE promoter that mediated inhibition by LPS in macrophages. For this purpose, cells were transiently transfected with reporter vectors encoding different apoE promoter fragments in conjunction with overexpression of kinases and nuclear factors previously shown to participate in LPS signaling. Initially, we examined the role of Tpl-2, a serine threonine kinase that belongs to the MAP 3-kinases family in apoE gene regulation (18Beinke S. Ley S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 19Tsatsanis C. UCSD-Nature Molecule Pages. 2006; doi: 10.1038/mp.a000092.01Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression of Tpl-2 in macrophages suppressed the activity of the full-length proximal (–500/+73) apoE promoter (41.7 ± 19.3% relative to control, p < 0.015). The dominant negative form of Tpl-2 (Tpl-2 DN) completely reversed the LPS-induced suppression of apoE promoter activity (Fig. 2A). Then, we examined the effect of Tpl-2 on the activity of the two fragments of apoE promoter: (–100/+73) and (–55/+73) (Fig. 2B). It is worth noting that the (–100/+73) apoE promoter fragment showed decreased reporter activity (to 39.2 ± 8.9% of the full-length fragment) and the –55/+73 fragment was associated with further diminished activity (to 5.2 ± 0.6% of the full-length fragment). Tpl-2 overexpression further reduced the activities of all apoE promoter fragments (Fig. 2B, black columns). These data indicated that the regulatory site is present in the smallest region of the proximal apoE promoter (–55/+73). Next, we tested the possible engagement of MEKK1 kinase in LPS-induced intracellular signaling that leads to apoE gene repression in macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2B (gray columns), MEKK1 overexpression decreased the activity of the (–500/+73) apoE promoter to 33.1 ± 4.7% (p < 0.015 versus control), of the (–100/+73) apoE promoter to 33.2 ± 5.9% (p < 0.02 versus control), and of the (–55/+73) apoE promoter to ∼12.4 ± 1.8% (p < 0.01 versus control) (Fig. 2B, gray columns). Taken together, the data presented in Fig. 2 indicated that Tpl-2 and MEKK1 kinases, known to be involved in the LPS signaling pathways, repress apoE promoter activity in macrophages. The effective inhibitory site is contained within the shortest fragment of the apoE promoter tested here, namely the (–55/+73) region. NF-κB Is Involved in LPS-induced ApoE Down-regulation and Is a Common Downstream Target of Tpl-2 and MEKK1—Next, we examined the involvement of the NF-κB pathway in the LPS-induced inhibition of apoE promoter activity in macrophages. For this purpose, we determined the nuclear and cytosolic distribution of the p50 subunit of NF-κB under LPS treatment. The Western blot data showed that the p50 precursor (p105) was present in the cytoplasmic fraction of untreated macrophages. After 3 h of exposure to LPS, the p50 subunit was translocated to the nucleus, where it remained during the subsequent 18 h of exposure to LPS. However, after 18 h of LPS exposure, p105 (p50 precursor) reappeared in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3A). Similar to the p50 subunit, tracking of the p65 subunit of NF-κB showed nuclear translocation after 3 h of LPS treatment (data not shown). Next, we evaluated whether NF-κB is involved in LPS-induced suppression of apoE promoter. Macrophages were transiently transfected with the (–500/+73) apoE promoter, along with Tpl-2 or MEKK1 in the presence or in the absence of a dominant negative form of IκB(IκBDN), and exposed to the LPS challenge. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the inhibitory effect of LPS on the (–500/+73) apoE promoter activity (columns 1 and 2) was reversed by the overexpression of IκBDN (column 3). Moreover, inhibition of apoE promoter activity by Tpl-2 and MEKK1 (columns 4 and 6, respectively), was completely reversed by IκBDN overexpression (columns 5 and 7, respectively). The region of the apoE promoter that responds to NF-κB activation was investigated by transient transactivation assays. Macrophages were transfected with the three fragments of the apoE promoter and either wild-type IKKβ kinase or a p50/65 hybrid. This hybrid is composed of the Rel homology domain of p50 and the transactivation domain of p65. The hybrid is a constitutively active protein that simulates the active p50/65 heterodimer of NF-κB. Overexpression of either IKKβ kinase or the p50/65 hybrid abolished the activity of all apoE promoter fragments (Fig. 3C), showing that the binding site for NF-κB is contained in the smallest apoE promoter fragment (–55/+73). To validate the activation of the NF-κB pathway by the plasmids employed here, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a vector containing three binding sites for NF-κB in sequence with the luciferase reporter gene ((NF-κB)3-luc). In transfected cells, overexpression of Tpl-2, MEKK1, and IKKβ activated the (NF-κB)3 promoter to various degrees (Fig. 3D). By contrast, overexpression of MEK1 did not affect the activity of the (NF-κB)3 promoter. These data demonstrate that NF-κB directly inhibits the apoE promoter and that the inhibitory effect of Tpl-2 and MEKK1 on the apoE promoter is mediated by their interference with the NF-κB pathway. AP-1 Transcription Factors Mediate the ApoE Promoter Down-regulation by Tpl-2 in Macrophages Exposed to LPS—We next evaluated the role of AP-1 transcription factors in apoE gene regulation in response to LPS treatment. For this purpose, macrophages were homogenized after incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS for variable periods of time and probed using specific antibodies in Western blot experiments. Up-regulated expression of c-Jun was noticed after a brief incubation (15 min) of the macrophages with LPS, and peak amounts were found after 60 min of incubation (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylated c-Jun was consistently increased as early as 15 min following LPS addition and was decreased after prolonged incubation of the macrophages with LPS (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation of c-Jun implied early activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), as observed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Activation of c-Jun depends on its translocation to the nucleus. In our experiments, an increase in the nuclear to cytosolic partition was directly related to the duration of macrophage incubation with LPS (Fig. 4A). Thus, in LPS-treated macrophages, c-Jun is up-regulated, phosphorylated, and translocates to the nucleus. Next, we investigated whether Tpl-2 and MEKK1 are responsible for c-Jun up-regulation and phosphorylation by LPS. HEK293 cells were transfected with Tpl-2 or MEKK1, and c-Jun expression and phosphorylation were evaluated by immunoblotting. c-Jun expression was quantified by normalization against β-galactosidase, cotransfected as an internal reference. Both Tpl-2 and MEKK1 induced c-Jun expression (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively) as compared with the control cells (Fig. 4B, lane 1). c-Jun induction by Tpl-2 and MEKK1 was decreased by ∼50% after c-Jun silencing using siRNA (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). Moreover, we detected the phosphorylated form of c-Jun in cells overexpressing Tpl-2 and MEKK1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8, respectively), as compared with the control (Fig. 4B, lane 6). To determine whether c-Jun is involved in the down-regulation of apoE promoter activity by Tpl-2 and MEKK1, cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector for Tpl-2 or MEKK1, the (–500/+73) apoE-luc plasmid and a siRNA specific for c-Jun. Partial inhibition of c-Jun expression by siRNA ameliorated the inhibitory effect of Tpl-2 and MEKK1 on the apoE promoter (Fig. 4C). The same results were obtained in RAW macrophages (not shown). The inverse relationship between the amount of total or phosphorylated c-Jun and the apoE promoter activity strongly suggested that c-Jun is a central mediator of apoE promoter regulation by Tpl-2 and MEKK1. Consistent with the data related to NF-κB, the site of c-Jun-mediated inhibition was identified in the shortest (–55/+73) apoE promoter fragment (Fig. 4D). To validate the binding of c-Jun to the (–55/+73) apoE promoter fragment, we performed DNA pulldown experiments. In these assays, the apoE promoter fragments –445/+73 and –55/+73 were amplified by PCR using biotinylated primers and were incubated with nuclear extract of LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These experiments showed that both –445/+73 and –55/+73 apoE promoter fragments bind c-Jun (Fig. 4E, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Competition experiments, in which two times excess of unbiotinylated DNA was added (under the same experimental conditions), revealed the specificity of the binding (Fig. 4E, lanes 2 and 4). Control experiments in which untreated RAW 264.7 cells were used under similar experimental conditions gave negative results (data not shown). In addition, another strategy was used to confirm the binding of c-Jun to the –55/+73 fragment of apoE promoter. The (–55/+73) apoE fragment was amplified by PCR using the plasmid (–55/+73) apoE-luc, as a template, and the biotinylated primer RV3, which corresponds to vector sequence and the reverse apoE +73 primer. This DNA fragment bound c-Jun present in LPS-treated nuclear extracts (Fig. 4E, lane 5), whereas no specific binding was detectable when the apoE promoter fragment was removed by KpnI digestion (Fig. 4E, lane 6). MEK1/2 Kinases Are Involved in the Repression of the ApoE Promoter Activity by Tpl-2 in Macrophages—We next determined the involvement of other kinases in apoE gene repression by LPS. We found that the repression in apoE gene expression by LPS in cultured MPMs (to 57 ± 4.6% relative to the control) was reversed by the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, as determined by RT-PCR. Furthermore, the MEK1 inhibitor counter-balanced very effectively the inhibition of apoE promoter activity by LPS in transiently transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 5B). The data represent the average of the intensity of the bands corresponding to the apoE gene obtained by RT-PCR normalized to the expression levels of GAPDH, using MPM isolated from three mice. To test whether MEK1 is a downstream target of Tpl-2 or MEKK1 in macrophages and mediates their negative effect on apoE promoter activity, RAW 264.7 cells were cotransfected with the plasmid (–500/+73) apoE-luc and the expression vectors for Tpl-2 (Fig. 5C) or MEKK1 (Fig. 5D) in the absence or presence of the inhibitor U0126. The results showed that the MEK1/2 inhibitor can only partially reverse the Tpl-2 repressive effect on the apoE promoter (Fig. 5C), whereas the MEKK1 inhibitory activity on the apoE promoter was not affected by U0126 (Fig. 5D). The same results were obtained using a different MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (data not shown). Another downstream target known to be engaged in MEKK1 signaling (through SAPK/ERK kinase) is p38 (20Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Cotransfection experiments in which an expression vector for p38 was used showed that overexpression of p38 did not influence the apoE promoter activity; moreover, the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, did not reverse the inhibitory activity of MEKK1 on the apoE promoter (data not shown). In other experiments, we tested whether LPS can activate ERK1/2, a known downstream target of MEK1/2. For this purpose, RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for different time intervals and were tested for the ERK1/2 phosphorylation by immunoblotting using antibodies that recognize phosphorylated ERK. The results showed that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is an early response to the LPS treatment, and both isoforms, p44 and p42, were phosphorylated after 10 min"

We describe the isolation of the snc1, sso1, and sso2 genes encoding exocytic SNARE proteins from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. The localization and interactions of the T. reesei SNARE proteins were studied with advanced fluorescence imaging methods. The SSOI and SNCI proteins co-localized in sterol-independent clusters on the plasma membrane in subapical but not apical hyphal regions. The vesicle SNARE SNCI also localized to the apical vesicle cluster within the Spitzenkoörper of the growing hyphal tips. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and Foerster resonance energy transfer analysis, we quantified the interactions between these proteins with high spatial resolution in living cells. Our data showed that the site of ternary SNARE complex formation between SNCI and SSOI or SSOII, respectively, is spatially segregated. SNARE complex formation could be detected between SNCI and SSOI in subapical hyphal compartments along the plasma membrane, but surprisingly, not in growing hyphal tips, previously thought to be the main site of exocytosis. In contrast, SNCI·SSOII complexes were found exclusively in growing apical hyphal compartments. These findings demonstrate spatially distinct sites of plasma membrane SNARE complex formation in fungi and the existence of multiple exocytic SNAREs, which are functionally and spatially segregated.

This is the first demonstration of spatially regulated SNARE interactions within the same membrane. Protein transport through the exocytic and endocytic pathways in eukaryotic cells occurs via vesicle trafficking between successive membrane-bounded compartments. The transport of vesicles from endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane requires a series of events involving budding from donor compartments and docking and fusion with acceptor compartments (1Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 2Goötte M. von Mollard G.F.

(soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) facilitate the fusion between vesicles and target membranes. SNAREs were originally divided into two classes according to their localization to vesicle (v-SNARE) or target (t-SNARE) membranes (3Soöllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Each SNARE protein contains a motif that is able to form a parallel α-helical structure with other SNARE motifs that brings the vesicle and target membranes into close proximity, allowing membrane fusion (3Soöllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Mammalian synaptic t-SNAREs can interact as a binary complex of one syntaxin and one SNAP-25 in cells (4Rickman C. Meunier F.A. Binz T. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 644-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in the absence of associated v-SNARE. The subsequent interaction of the appropriate v-SNARE with this binary SNARE complex allows the formation of the SNARE ternary complex and thus defines the location of vesicle fusion (4Rickman C. Meunier F.A. Binz T. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 644-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the stable ternary SNARE complex forms before the final fusion event is initiated. In addition to the mammalian exocytic SNAREs, the best characterized SNAREs are the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane trafficking counterparts (5Gerst J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). SNARE complex formation in the yeast secretory pathway has been shown to begin with the formation of binary complexes between two t-SNAREs, Ssop (a syntaxin homolog) and Sec9 (the SNAP-25 homolog) (7Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), that are then capable of binding the v-SNARE Sncp. The Sso and Sec9 proteins have been shown to be located uniformly over the plasma membrane in these geometrically simple cells (8Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keraönen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast cells, filamentous fungi exhibit highly polarized growth at the hyphal tips. This involves the delivery of Golgi apparatus-derived secretory vesicles to the apical plasma membrane via an apical vesicle cluster within a multicomponent complex called the Spitzenkoörper (9Virag A. Harris S.D. Mycol. Res. 2006; 110: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These secretory vesicles contain membrane proteins and lipids, enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis, and possibly cell wall precursors (10Grove S.N. Bracker C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 989-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exocytosis of extracellular enzymes (i.e. in contrast to “constitutive” secretion at growth cones or buds) into the external medium is generally believed to occur mainly from hyphal tips, few studies have actually localized the subcellular sites of secretion. Immunogold and green fluorescent protein localization of glucoamylase in Aspergillus niger supported the hypothesis that the secretion of this enzyme primarily takes place from hyphal tips (11Gordon C.L. Archer D.B. Jeenes D.J. Doonan J.H. Wells B. Trinci A.P. Robson G.D. J. Microbiol. Meth. 2000; 42: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Woösten H.A. Moukha S.M. Sietsma J.H. Wessels J.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that enzymes might also be secreted from subapical hyphal locations (13Nykaönen M. Saarelainen R. Raudaskoski M. Nevalainen H. Mikkonen A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Weber R. Pitt D. Mycol. Res. 1997; 101: 1431-1439Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but this has never been shown directly. Understanding of the fungal secretion pathway has significantly increased recently. Based on the analysis of sequenced fungal genomes, it is clear that the secretory machinery of filamentous fungi has similar features to that of other eukaryotes (15Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Yarden O.

Here, we have used a combination of in vitro biochemistry, in vivo complementation assays, and advanced live cell imaging techniques to quantify novel SNARE protein targeting, co-localization, and interactions in filamentous fungi. As the v-SNARE interacts with t-SNAREs after formation of the fungal SSO-Sec9 binary complex (7Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), by quantifying the interaction of a vesicular v-SNARE with two plasma membrane t-SNAREs using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)/FRET analysis, we have identified different subcellular sites for exocytic SNARE ternary complex formation in living fungal hyphae. Interestingly, the interactions between a sole v-SNARE and two alternative t-SNAREs are spatially segregated. This is the first time that SNARE protein interactions have been demonstrated directly in living fungal cells; these data reveal contrasts with mammalian SNARE cluster regulation and also suggest an alternative exocytic pathway to the constitutive secretion known to occur via the Spitzenkoörper at hyphal tips. Importantly, this is the first time that spatially regulated SNARE interactions have been found on the plasma membrane. S. cerevisiae Suppression and Complementation Studies—A Trichoderma reesei cDNA expression library (23Margolles-Clark E. Tenkanen M. Nakari-Setaölaö T. Penttilaö M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3840-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the vector pAJ401 (24Saloheimo A. Henrissat B. Hoffren A.M. Teleman O. Penttilaö M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was transformed into the SSO2 temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain H1152 (Mata, sso2-1, leu2-1, trp1-1, ura3-1, sso1::HIS3 (25Jaöntti J. Aalto M.K. Oyen M. Sundqvist L. Keraönen S. Ronne H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 409-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were plated on synthetic complete (SC) medium (-Ura) with 2% galactose as the carbon source, and the plates were incubated at the restrictive temperature, 31 °C. Transformants that were able to grow on these plates were grown as streaks under the same conditions and then replicated for growth at 31, 33, 35, and 37 °C. Plasmids were isolated from clones that were able to grow at 37 °C and transferred into Escherichia coli for sequencing. The suppression of the SSO2 temperature-sensitive mutation was tested by transforming the plasmid pMS84 obtained in the original screening back to the H1152 strain. After transformation, the strain was grown on SC (-Ura) plates with 2% galactose as a carbon source. For the suppression studies, the transformants were streaked on the same medium and replicated to parallel plates that were incubated at 24, 31, 33, and 37 °C. Suppression of Sso1p and Sso2p depletion was tested in the H458 strain (Matα, ade2-1, his3-11, trp1-1, ura3-1, sso1-S1::LEU2, sso2-S1::leu2::(GAL1:SSOI, HIS3) (courtesy of Hans Ronne, Uppsala University, Sweden). The strain was grown after transformation on SC (-Ura) plates with 2% galactose as a carbon source, and the transformants were replicated on either YP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) or SC (-Ura) plates with 2% glucose as the carbon source and grown at 30 °C. For the analysis of the complementation of Snc1p and Snc2p depletion, the T. reesei snc1 cDNA was cloned as an EcoRI-XhoI fragment into a S. cerevisiae single copy plasmid pKKl with the PGK1 promoter and terminator and LEU2 selectable marker. The resulting plasmid was called pMV20, and it was transformed into the JG8 T15:85 (Mata his3 leu2 trp1 snc1::URA3 snc2::ADE8 pGAL-TSNCI) (26Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) strain. Transformants were grown on SC (-Leu-Trp) plates with 2% galactose as the carbon source. For complementation testing, the transformants were grown on SC (-Leu-Trp) plates with 2% galactose as the carbon source for 3 days and then replicated on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or SC (-Leu-Trp) plates with 2% galactose as the carbon source and grown at 30 °C for 4 days. To test the complementation of the temperature sensitivity defect, transformants were replicated on SC (-Leu-Trp) plates with 2% glucose as the carbon source and grown at 24, 30, and 37 °C for 4 days. For the analysis of the complementation of Sso1p and Sso2p depletion, the T. reesei sso1 cDNA was cloned into the S. cerevisiae expression vector pAJ401, either as a fusion with the mCerulean fluorescent protein (27Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) or as a non-fusion, creating vectors pMV61 and pMV62, respectively. The T. reesei sso2 cDNA was cloned into the pYES-DEST53 Gateway vector (Invitrogen), creating the pMV72 plasmid. All constructs were transformed into the SSO2 temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain H1152. Transformants were plated on SC (-Ura) with 2% galactose as the carbon source, and the plates were incubated at the permissive temperature, 24 °C. Transformants that were able to grow on these plates were incubated as streaks under the same conditions and then replicated for growth at 24, 31, 33, 35, and 37 °C. Invertase Assay—To study the ability of T. reesei SNCI to suppress the defect in invertase secretion in a strain depleted of both Snc proteins, an experiment was done with modifications as described by Ref. 26Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar. The invertase assay was done using the JG8 T15:85 strain transformed with the pMV20-construct or the expression vector pKKl alone and with the wild type strain NY15 (Matα, ura3-52, his4-619, courtesy of Peter Novick, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Two parallel cultures of the strains were grown in SC (-Leu-Trp) medium with 4% galactose as the carbon source at 30 °C for 2 days. The cultures were then diluted to an A600 of 0.2 in the same medium and grown at 30 °C until the A600 was 2.5. After this, the cultures were transferred to SC (-Leu-Trp) medium with 2% glucose as the carbon source and grown at 24 or 30 °C. This was done to deplete the cells of the endogenous Snc1 protein. The cultures were kept in the early logarithmic growth phase throughout the experiment by repeated dilutions in the same medium. After growth in glucose-containing medium for 12 h, samples of 4 × 108 cells were removed from each culture, centrifuged, and resuspended in 20 ml of SC-Leu-Trp medium with 0.05% glucose as the carbon source to derepress the invertase gene. The samples were incubated at 24 or 30 °C for 2 h. A sample of A600 2.5 was taken from each culture for the invertase assay. The invertase assay was performed as described in Ref. 28Goldstein A. Lampen J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar. Confocal Live Cell Imaging—For imaging, the yeast transformants with the pMV62 expression construct and the controls (transformants with pAJ401 vector alone) were grown in SC (-Ura) with 2% galactose for 2 days. 200-μl drops of diluted cell suspension were placed in an eight-well slide culture chamber (Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY). For imaging T. reesei, the snc1 cDNA was cloned into the pContV vector (courtesy of Dr. N. Curach, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia), where it was expressed as an N-terminal fusion to the fluorescent protein Venus (29Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar) under the endogenous cbh1 promoter. The resulting expression vector was called pMV63. For the construction of the mCer·SSOI and mCer·SSOII fusion proteins under the cbh1 promoter, the Venus in pContV vector was replaced with mCerulean. The sso1 and sso2 cDNAs were cloned into this vector, and the resulting vectors were called pMV67 and pMV77, respectively. The expression vectors were transformed into T. reesei RutC-30 (30Montenecourt B.S. Eveleigh D.E. Adv. Chem. Ser. 1979; 181: 289-301Crossref Google Scholar), creating pMV63, pMV67, and PMV77 single transformants or pMV63/67 and pMV63/77 double transformants. For imaging purposes, the strains were grown on plates on T. reesei minimal medium (31Penttilaö M. Nevalainen H. Rattoö M. Salminen E. Knowles J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) for 5 days, and the inverted agar block method of sample preparation (32Hickey P.C. Swift S.R. Roca M.G. Read N.D. Savidge T. Pothoulakis C. Meth. Microbiol.2004: 63-87Google Scholar) was used. 10 or 30 μm FM4-64 (prepared from 1 m stock in Me2SO; Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) was used in combination with fluorescent protein labeling. The stain was added to the agar block containing the mycelial sample 10 min before imaging. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Radiance 2100 confocal system equipped with blue diode and argon ion lasers (Bio-Rad Microscience) mounted on a Nikon TE2000U Eclipse inverted microscope. mCerulean was imaged on its own with excitation at 405 nm and fluorescence detection at 470/90 nm; Venus was imaged on its own with excitation at 514 nm and fluorescence detection at 530/50 nm; and Venus and FM4-64 were imaged simultaneously by excitation with the 514 nm laser line with fluorescence detected at 530/50 nm (for Venus) and >620 nm (for FM4-64). A ×60 (1.2 NA) plan apo water immersion objective lens was used for imaging. The laser intensity and laser scanning were kept to a minimum to reduce phototoxic effects. Simultaneous, bright-field images were captured with a transmitted light detector. Kalman filtering (n = 1) was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual images. Images were captured with a laser scan speed of 50 lines/s at a resolution of 1,024 by 1,024 pixels. Confocal images were captured with Lasersharp 2000 software (version 5.1; Bio-Rad Microscience) and were further processed using Image J 1.34S software (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD). Two-photon Microscopy—All further imaging experiments were performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Axiovert confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with a pulsed excitation source (MIRA 900 Ti:Sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser, with a coupled VERDI 10-watt pump laser (Coherent, Ely, UK). The laser was tuned to provide a two-photon excitation (TPE) wavelength of 800 nm, which efficiently excited mCerulean, without any detectable excitation or emission from Venus in the absence of FRET from a donor. TPE data acquisition was performed using 1024 × 1024-pixel image sizes, with 4× frame averaging, using a Zeiss Plan NeoFLUAR ×63 (1.4 NA) oil immersion objective or a Zeiss C-Apochromat ×63 (1.2 NA) water immersion objective. Band pass and long pass emission filters were used, as detailed under “Results”, in conjunction with a Schott (New York, NY) BG39 IR filter to attenuate the TPE light. Image data acquired at Nyquist sampling rates were deconvoluted using Huygens Pro software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands), and the resulting three-dimensional models were analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane AG, Zuörich) on dual Opteron workstations. Co-localization was quantified as described previously by extracting all voxels in three dimensions containing both mCerulean and Venus data above background and reconstructing them into a new, co-localization channel. Co-localization maps were generated using the Manders approach, with automatic thresholding performed according to the method of Costes. Cell peripheries were determined using transmitted light imaging combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy data (33Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol.

TCSPC-FLIM—A number of different approaches to analyzing FRET have been described, using fluorescence intensities in image data and requiring arithmetical corrections to subtract background and to remove undesired spectral bleed-through between the donor and the acceptor. We found that intensity based approaches were not sufficiently sensitive to quantify FRET efficiency between the two fluorescent proteins with useful spatial resolution; also, the limited dynamic range reported an all-or-nothing signal. Thus, to further quantify FRET between labeled SNCI and the two SSO proteins, we employed multidimensional time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)-FLIM, essentially as described previously (33Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Duncan R.R. Bergmann A. Cousin M.A. Apps D.K. Shipston M.J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2004; 215: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TCSPC measurements were made under 820 nm TPE, using a non-descanned detector (Hamamatsu R3809U-50; Hamamatsu Photonics UK Ltd., Herts, UK) multichannel plate-photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) or a fast photomultiplier tube (H7422; Hamamatsu Photonics) coupled directly to the rear port of the Axiovert microscope and protected from room light and other sources of overload using a Uniblitz shutter (Rochester, NY). Dark count rates were 102-103 photons/s. The MCP-PMT was operated at 3 kV, and signal pulses were preamplified using a Becker & Hickl HFAC-26 26 dB, 1.6-GHz preamplifier. TCSPC recording used the “reversed start stop” approach, with accurate laser synchronization using a Becker & Hickl SPC-830 card together with a PHD-400 reference photodiode, routinely at 79.4 MHz. Band pass and long pass filters were used to enable spectral separation of donor and acceptor FRET- and sensitized-emissions. 3-6-mm Schott BG39 filters were positioned directly in front of the MCP-PMT. TCSPC recordings were acquired routinely for between 5 and 25 s, and mean photon counts were between 105 and 106 cps. Images were recorded 256 × 256 pixels from a 1024 × 1024-image scan with 256 time bins over a 12-ns period. FLIM data were acquired for between 5 and 60 s for a 1024 × 1024-image frame. FLIM Data Analysis and FRET Calculations—Off-line FLIM data analysis used pixel-based fitting software (SPCImage, Becker & Hickl). The fluorescence was assumed to follow a multiexponential decay. In addition, an adaptive offset correction was performed. A constant offset takes into consideration the time-independent baseline due to dark noise of the detector and the background caused by room light, calculated from the average number of photons per channel in front of the rising part of the fluorescence trace. To fit the parameters of the multiexponential decay to the fluorescence decay trace measured by the system, a convolution with the instrumental response function was carried out. The optimization of the fit parameters was performed by using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, minimizing the weighted chi-square quantity. The approach can be used to separate the interacting from the non-interacting donor fraction in our FRET systems. The slow (long lifetime) component τ2 was determined by control assays with mCerulean alone or expressed with (non-interacting) Venus in the way described above. This value is finally used as a fixed τ2 lifetime for all other experiments. Fluorescence lifetimes here are expressed as the weighted mean of two fitted exponential functions in each pixel. As controls for nonspecific FRET or FRET between green fluorescent proteins that may form dimers spontaneously when overexpressed in cells, we determined the fluorescence lifetimes of mCerulean-SSOI alone, mCerulean alone, or mCerulean-SSOI co-expressed with Venus (not shown). No FRET was detected in any of these experiments. Likewise, experiments using mCeruleanA206K-fused SSOI revealed no self-dimerization between fluorescent proteins (not shown). Itraconazole Treatment—For testing the effect of itraconazole on growth and protein secretion, two pMV63/67 transformants expressing Venus·SNCI and mCer·SSOI fusion proteins were grown in a minimal medium (31Penttilaö M. Nevalainen H. Rattoö M. Salminen E. Knowles J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) with 2% lactose in shake flasks for 3 days. Each culture was divided into four aliquots, and itraconazole (10, 50, and 100 μm in Me2SO) was added to three aliquots. Samples from the culture supernatants were taken once a day for 5 days, and endoglucanase activities were analyzed as described in Ref. 35Bailey M.J. Nevalainen K.M.H. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1981; 3: 153-157Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar. For imaging, the T. reesei strains were grown on plates as described above. After 5 days, 10 or 50 μm itraconazole in Me2SO was added to an agar block cut out from the cultures, and the samples were incubated at 28 °C for 16 h. Before imaging, the samples were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Protein Sequence Alignment—Protein sequences were aligned with ClustalW (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

https://openalex.org/W2052004230,"Background Small heat shock proteins regulate microtubule assembly during cell proliferation and in response to stress through interactions that are poorly understood. Methodology Novel functions for five interactive sequences in the small heat shock protein and molecular chaperone, human αB crystallin, were investigated in the assembly/disassembly of microtubules and aggregation of tubulin using synthetic peptides and mutants of human αB crystallin. Principal Findings The interactive sequence 113FISREFHR120 exposed on the surface of αB crystallin decreased microtubule assembly by ∼45%. In contrast, the interactive sequences, 131LTITSSLSSDGV142 and 156ERTIPITRE164, corresponding to the β8 strand and the C-terminal extension respectively, which are involved in complex formation, increased microtubule assembly by ∼34–45%. The αB crystallin peptides, 113FISREFHR120 and 156ERTIPITRE164, inhibited microtubule disassembly by ∼26–36%, and the peptides 113FISREFHR120 and 131LTITSSLSSDGV142 decreased the thermal aggregation of tubulin by ∼42–44%. The 131LTITSSLSSDGV142 and 156ERTIPITRE164 peptides were more effective than the widely used anti-cancer drug, Paclitaxel, in modulating tubulin↔microtubule dynamics. Mutagenesis of these interactive sequences in wt human αB crystallin confirmed the effects of the αB crystallin peptides on microtubule assembly/disassembly and tubulin aggregation. The regulation of microtubule assembly by αB crystallin varied over a narrow range of concentrations. The assembly of microtubules was maximal at αB crystallin to tubulin molar ratios between 1∶4 and 2∶1, while molar ratios >2∶1 inhibited microtubule assembly. Conclusions and Significance Interactive sequences on the surface of human αB crystallin collectively modulate microtubule assembly through a dynamic subunit exchange mechanism that depends on the concentration and ratio of αB crystallin to tubulin. These are the first experimental results in support of the functional importance of the dynamic subunit model of small heat shock proteins."

To further uncover the mechanism of miconazole antifungal action and tolerance mechanisms, we screened the complete set of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion mutants for mutants with an altered miconazole sensitivity phenotype.

Major functional groups encode proteins involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, membrane trafficking including endocytosis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and gene expression.

In this respect, we demonstrate that miconazole induces changes in the actin cytoskeleton, indicative of increased filament stability, prior to ROS induction. These data provide novel mechanistic insights in the mode of action of a ROS-inducing azole. Miconazole belongs to the azole antifungals, which are currently the most widely used antimycotics. Azoles inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis, resulting in accumulation of toxic methylated sterol intermediates and, subsequently, fungal cell growth arrest (1Vanden Bossche H. Marichal P. Willemsens G. Bellens D. Gorrens J. Roels I. Coene M.C. Le Jeune L. Janssen P.A. Mycoses. 1990; 33: 335-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an additional mode of antifungal action was uncovered for miconazole. Apart from inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, miconazole induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) 6The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration of miconazole; MM, minimal medium. in susceptible fungi, leading to fungal cell death (2Kobayashi D.

The aim of the present study was to further unravel the mode of antifungal action of miconazole and tolerance mechanisms against miconazole in yeast. Information regarding drug tolerance mechanisms is invaluable for antifungal therapy: theoretically, miconazole action can be increased by using inhibitors of identified yeast tolerance mechanisms. To our knowledge, this study is the first report on yeast tolerance mechanisms against imidazoles, such as miconazole, and their mode of action using a genome-wide screening approach in yeast. A similar approach was previously used by Parsons et al. (4Parsons A.B. Brost R.L. Ding H. Li Z. Shang C. Sheikh B. Brown G.W. Kane P.M. Hughes T.R. Boone C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) to uncover yeast tolerance mechanisms against various chemical compounds, including the triazole fluconazole. However, miconazole and fluconazole are characterized by different activity features: fluconazole does not seem to induce ROS to the same extent as miconazole in susceptible fungi (2Kobayashi D. Kondo K. Uehara N. Otokozawa S. Tsuji N. Yagihashi A. Watanabe N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3113-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3François I.E.J.A. Cammue B.P.A. Borgers M. Ausma J. Dispersyn G.D. Thevissen K. Anti-Infect. Agents Med. Chem. 2006; 5: 3-13Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we screened the haploid set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants in non-essential genes for both hypersensitivity and resistance to miconazole by determining the minimal inhibitory miconazole concentration (MIC) for all individual yeast knock-out mutants using 2-fold dilution series of miconazole in liquid YPD medium. In this way, no miconazole-resistant yeast mutants could be identified. However, we could identify 29 S. cerevisiae genes or open reading frames that upon deletion result in at least 4-fold hypersensitivity to miconazole and hence are involved in miconazole tolerance. The following major functional families of miconazole tolerance genes could be distinguished: (i) tryptophan biosynthesis, (ii) membrane trafficking, including endocytosis, (iii) regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and (iv) regulation of gene expression. These genetic data were confirmed by biochemical tests using excess Trp or the endocytosis inhibitor compound 5235236 (C5235236) (5Toenjes K.A. Munsee S.M. Ibrahim A.S. Jeffrey R. Edwards J.E. Johnson D.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Regarding miconazole antifungal action, we could demonstrate an antagonism with Trp on one hand and a synergy with C5235236 on the other hand. Moreover, because the actin cytoskeleton in yeast has been demonstrated to regulate ROS induction and apoptosis or programmed cell death in yeast via interactions with the mitochondria (6Gourlay C.W. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we further focused on the effect of the ROS-inducing azole miconazole on actin cytoskeleton in yeast. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strains used are S. cerevisiae strain BY4741, the BY4741-derived deletion mutant library (4853 mutants; Invitrogen), S. cerevisiae strain W303-1A (MATa leu2–3/112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3–11/15 ade2-1 can1– 100), and Candida albicans strain SC5314 CAI (7Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The media used were YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), MM-Trp (0.8 g/liter complete supplement mixture-Trp, complete amino acid supplement mixture minus tryptophan, Bio 101 Systems; 6.5 g/liter yeast nitrogen base; 20 g/liter glucose), minimal medium (MM)-Tyr or MM-Phe (6.5 g/liter yeast nitrogen base; 20 g/liter glucose; 20 mg/liter adenine sulfate; 20 mg/liter uracil; 20 mg/liter histidine; 20 mg/liter arginine; 20 mg/liter methionine; 20 mg/liter tryptophan; 30 mg/liter leucine; 30 mg/liter isoleucine; 30 mg/liter lysine; 100 mg/liter glutamic acid; 100 mg/liter aspartic acid; 150 mg/liter valine; 200 mg/liter threonine; 400 mg/liter serine, supplemented with either 50 mg/liter phenylalanine or 30 mg/liter tyrosine). The endocytosis inhibitor compound 5235236 (C5235236) was purchased from Chem Bridge (San Diego, CA). Screening of a Yeast Deletion Mutant Library for Altered Miconazole Sensitivity—The minimal inhibitory concentration of miconazole for the individual deletion mutants (MIC) was determined in YPD medium in sealed 96-well microplates and compared with MIC of S. cerevisiae BY4741 wild type. To this end, 80 μl of a stationary culture of each deletion mutant, grown in YPD in 96-well microplates and diluted in fresh YPD to ∼106 cells/ml, was added to 20 μl of a miconazole dilution series, ranging from 12.5 to 0.025 μg/ml, in 2% Me2SO. A same concentration of Me2SO served as negative control. The 96-well microplates were sealed with plastic EASYseal stickers (Greiner Bio-One) and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. Growth of the yeast cultures was assessed microscopically, and MIC for each yeast deletion strain was determined. Slow growing yeast mutants were incubated for 48 h till A600 of the corresponding 2% Me2SO control was >0.7 as determined by a microplate reader (VERSAmax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Effect of Endocytosis Inhibitor Compound 5235236, Tryptophan, Tyrosine, and Phenylalanine on Miconazole Action—To test the effect of tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), or phenylalanine (Phe) on the antifungal action of miconazole, an overnight S. cerevisiae W303-1A or Candida albicans culture grown in YPD was 1/100 diluted (∼106 cells/ml) in MM-Trp, MM-Tyr or MM-Phe, respectively, in the presence of miconazole or Me2SO in combination with concentrations of Trp, Tyr, or Phe ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm. To test the effect of C5235236, dissolved in Me2SO, the yeast cultures were 1/100 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (∼106 cells/ml) in the presence of miconazole or Me2SO in combination with C5235236. After 5 h of incubation in sealed 96-well microplates at 37 °C, viability of the yeast cultures was analyzed by counting the number of colony-forming units/ml on YPD agar plates. Fluorescence Methods for Visualization of Actin and Cell Nuclei and for Detection of ROS—Rhodamine-phalloidin staining was performed as previously described for F-actin (6Gourlay C.W. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Hagan I.M. Ayscough K.R. Allen V.J. Protein Localization by Fluorescence Microscopy: A Practical Approach. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000: 179-206Google Scholar). Fixed cells were mounted in medium containing the DNA binding dye 4′6′ diamidino 2-phenylindole dihydrochloride to allow nuclei to be visualized. For co-detection of endogenous ROS levels, miconazole-treated cells were incubated in the presence of 5 μg/ml 2′,7′-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) as described (9Gourlay C.W. Carpp L.N. Timpson P. Winder S.J. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, flow cytometry parameters were set at excitation and emission settings of 304 and 551 nm (filter FL-1), respectively. For each experiment two peaks of fluorescence were observed. The second peak represents cells with high levels of ROS. The summary data plotted in Fig. 3 are the percentage of cells in this second peak. In each case experiments have been repeated at least three times independently. Representative data sets are depicted. Errors are calculated as S.D. from each of these three experiments. Identification of Miconazole-hypersensitive S. cerevisiae Deletion Mutants—To identify genes that may contribute to miconazole tolerance or its antifungal action, we screened the haploid set of S. cerevisiae mutants individually deleted for 4853 nonessential yeast genes for hypersensitivity or resistance to miconazole. Because miconazole susceptibility testing of yeast strains in liquid medium is hampered by trailing growth, i.e. growth of the yeast strain at concentrations above the MIC, selection of an appropriate concentration to analyze the sensitivity phenotype of the yeast mutants is difficult. Therefore, in this study, all the individual yeast mutants were analyzed against 2-fold dilution series of miconazole. Unfortunately, we could not identify miconazole-resistant yeast deletion mutants, i.e. deletion mutants with at least 4-fold increased MIC, indicating that susceptibility of yeast to miconazole in liquid medium is not determined by any of the non-essential genes in S. cerevisiae. Strains with at least 4-fold reduced MIC as compared with MIC for BY4741 wild type, i.e. 1 μg/ml after 24 h of incubation, were designated miconazole-hypersensitive. In this way, we could identify 29 deletion mutants with at least 4-fold increased sensitivity to miconazole. The identified miconazole tolerance genes are listed in Table 1 with their corresponding miconazole hypersensitivity factor (MicoHSF), which was calculated as MIC(WT)/MIC(mutant). Most genes fall into a limited set of functional classes and define specific areas of cellular biology, including (i) tryptophan biosynthesis, (ii) membrane trafficking including endocytosis, (iii) regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and (iv) regulation of gene expression.TABLE 1Miconazole tolerance genes in S. cerevisiaeGeneOpen reading frameDescription of gene productMicoHSFaMicoHSF, miconazole-hypersensitivity factor (MIC (BY4741)/MIC (deletion mutant)).Tryptophan biosynthesis (17%)ARO2YGL148wBifunctional chorismate synthase and flavin reductase16ARO1YDR127wPentafunctional chorismate biosynthesis catalyzing enzyme8TRP3YKL211cBifunctional enzyme: indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase and anthranilate synthases8TRP1YDR007wPhosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase4TRP2YER090wAnthranilate synthase catalyzing4Membrane trafficking including endocytosis (24%)ARV1YLR242cProtein required for normal intracellular sterol distribution and for sphingolipid metabolism16GCS1YDL226cADP-ribosylation factor GTPase activating protein, involved in ER-Golgi transport16DRS2YAL026cPhospholipids translocase, involved in maintaining lipid bilayer asymmetry8RCY1YJL204cF-box protein involved in recycling plasma membrane proteins internalized by endocytosis8CDC50YCR094wNoncatalytic subunit of Drs2p, present in the endosomal/trans-Golgi network compartments4TVP18YMR071cIntegral membrane protein localized to late Golgi vesicles along with the v-SNARE Tlg2p4CLC1YGR167wClathrin light chain, subunit of the coatamer involved in protein transport and endocytosis4Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (14%)VPS1YKR001cMember of the dynamin family of GTPases, functions in actin cytoskeleton organization8HOF1YMR032wProtein required for cytokinesis, regulates actomyosin ring dynamics and septin localization4SSD1YDR293cProtein with a role in maintenance of cellular integrity4TPD3YAL016wRegulatory subunit A of protein phosphatase 2A, required for cell morphogenesis4Regulation of gene expression (28%)CBF1YJR060wHelix-loop-helix protein, required for nucleosome positioning at the CACRTG motif4FYV6YNL133cProtein that interacts with Rif2, controling telomere length and establishes telomeric silencing4GCN5YGR252wHistone acetyltransferase, catalytic subunit of ADA/SAGA complexes4HFI1YPL254wAdaptor protein required for structural integrity of the SAGA complex4NGG1YDR176wComponent of ADA/SAGA histone acetyltransferase complexes, and the SLIK complex4SNT309YPR101wComponent of NineTeen complex (NTC) that is involved in mRNA splicing4SPT4YGR063cMediator of activation/inhibition of transcription elongation, pre-mRNA processing4THP2YHR167wSubunit of the THA complex, connecting transcription elongation and mitotic recombination4Varia (17%)PHO88YBR106wMembrane protein involved in phosphate intake16RMD8YFR048wProtein required for sporulation and meiotic nuclear division16CNB1YKL190wCalcineurinB, regulatory subunit of the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin4CTR1YPR124wHigh-affinity copper transporter of the plasma membrane4YPR089wHypothetical protein4a MicoHSF, miconazole-hypersensitivity factor (MIC (BY4741)/MIC (deletion mutant)). Open table in a new tab The fraction of miconazole tolerance genes implicated in gene expression (27.5%) probably represents general stress tolerance mechanisms. In the next paragraphs, the obtained genetic data regarding a putative role of tryptophan biosynthesis, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeleton in miconazole tolerance will be further validated using biochemical approaches. Miconazole Tolerance Genes Implicated in Tryptophan Metabolism—We identified five miconazole tolerance genes involved in Trp biosynthesis (i.e. ARO1, ARO2, TRP1, TRP2, and TRP3), pointing to a protective effect of Trp against miconazole action. Indeed, incubation of S. cerevisiae W303-1A wild type with 0.1 to 5 mm Trp antagonizes the activity of 5 μg/ml miconazole (Fig. 1). Survival of the yeast culture after 5 h of incubation with 5 μg/ml miconazole was 44%, whereas addition of 0.1–5 mm Trp increased the yeast cell survival to up to 100%. These data corroborate earlier findings regarding alleviation of the growth inhibitory effect of an antifungal compound by Trp (10Rodriguez-Hernandez C.J. Sanchez-Perez I. Gil-Mascarell R. Rodriguez-Afonso A. Torres A. Perona R. Murguia J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33887-33895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Koller A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6597-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In these studies, either 0.4 or 5 mm Trp was used. The observed antagonism between Trp and miconazole is lost when incubating the yeast cells with 10 mm Trp. In contrast, incubation of yeast cells with 0.5–10 mm of the other aromatic amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine, in combination with 5 μg/ml miconazole, did not result in protection of yeast cells against miconazole antifungal action (data not shown), pointing to a Trp-specific antagonizing effect of miconazole activity. Miconazole Tolerance Genes Implicated in Membrane Trafficking including Endocytosis—We identified seven miconazole tolerance genes involved in membrane trafficking including endocytosis (i.e. ARV1, GCS1, DRS2, CDC50, TVP18, CLC1, and RCY1) and further assessed the effect of compound 5235236 (C5235236), which inhibits endocytosis in yeast (5Toenjes K.A. Munsee S.M. Ibrahim A.S. Jeffrey R. Edwards J.E. Johnson D.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), on miconazole antifungal action. We observed a synergy between C5235236 and miconazole on S. cerevisiae cells starting from 6.3 μg/ml miconazole and 25 μg/ml C5235236 (Fig. 2A); incubation of yeast cells with either 25 μg/ml C5235236 or 6.3 μg/ml miconazole resulted in 20 or 10% survival, respectively, whereas the combined action resulted in less than 0.02% survival, pointing to a synergy of at least a factor 100. The obtained data with S. cerevisiae implicate that efficient antifungal therapy could consist of miconazole in combination with C5235236. Therefore, we assessed the effect of C5235236 on miconazole antifungal action against C. albicans. We observed a similar synergy between C5235236 and miconazole starting from 25 μg/ml C5235236 and 6.3 μg/ml miconazole on C. albicans (Fig. 2B); incubation of yeast cells with either 25 μg/ml C5235236 or 6.3 μg/ml miconazole resulted in 70 or 40% survival, respectively, whereas the combined action resulted in 0.4% survival, pointing to a synergy of a factor 70. These data point to a functional endocytotic pathway as a prerequisite for miconazole tolerance in both yeast species. Effect of Miconazole on Actin Cytoskeleton—We identified four miconazole tolerance genes involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (i.e. TPD3, SSD1, HOF1, and VPS1). Because miconazole induces ROS generation in susceptible fungi, and actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in mitochondrial activity and regulation of endogenous ROS levels (6Gourlay C.W. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we further focused on a putative effect of miconazole on actin cytoskeleton organization. To this end, miconazole (20 μg/ml) or Me2SO was added to wild type yeast cells (BY4741) during exponential growth phase. Samples were taken hourly to determine the effects of the drug on the actin cytoskeleton, using the actin visualization dye rhodamine-phalloidin. In untreated cells, the normal organization of cortical actin patches and polarized actin cables were clearly observed at all time points (Fig. 3A). Addition of 20 μg/ml miconazole resulted in changes in the actin cytoskeleton such that 66% of cells contained F-actin aggregates after 3 h of miconazole treatment; this increased to 82% after 4 h of miconazole treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Experiments that were conducted in parallel to determine the level of ROS in cells after 2, 3, and 4 h of miconazole incubation indicated that the proportion of cells with high levels of ROS was less than 1% after 2 h, rising to 12% after 4 h (Fig. 3B). Analysis of these cells by flow cytometry indicated no levels of autofluorescence in the samples in the absence of the ROS detection dye (data not shown). After 2 h of miconazole incubation, cell nuclei and mitochondria as visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining appeared the same as in untreated cells with no observable condensation or fragmentation detected (data not shown). After 4 h of miconazole treatment, some nuclear fragmentation could be detected (Fig. 3A). In addition, loss of mitochondrial morphology was observed as faint 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-positive spots in miconazole-treated cells (Fig. 3A). This is not surprising because mitochondria align along actin cables, which are disrupted upon miconazole treatment. All these data indicate that the changes to the actin cytoskeleton precede the induction of ROS and are in agreement with the model that increased actin stability can act as a trigger for ROS induction and programmed cell death pathway in yeast (6Gourlay C.W. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Gourlay C.W. Carpp L.N. Timpson P. Winder S.J. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Moreover, we assessed the actin cytoskeleton organization in the identified four miconazole-hypersensitive yeast mutants (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the actin cytoskeleton of these mutants closely resembles the actin cytoskeleton of wild type yeast cells after miconazole treatment, pointing to the importance for the actin cytoskeleton in miconazole toxicity in yeast. To uncover tolerance mechanisms of yeast against the imidazole miconazole and gain more insight in its mode of action, we screened the complete set of haploid deletion mutants of S. cerevisiae for increased sensitivity and resistance toward miconazole. No miconazole-resistant yeast deletion mutants could be identified, indicating that susceptibility of yeast to miconazole in liquid medium is not determined by any of the non-essential genes in S. cerevisiae. However, we identified 29 genes in yeast that upon deletion result in at least 4-fold hyper-sensitivity toward miconazole and hence are implicated in miconazole tolerance. Major functional groups of miconazole tolerance genes are implicated in (i) tryptophan biosynthesis, (ii) membrane trafficking including endocytosis, (iii) regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and (iv) regulation of gene expression. Using haplo-insufficiency profiling data, Flaherty et al. (13Flaherty P. Giaever G. Kumm J. Jordan M.I. Arkin A.P. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) recently identified various genes not previously known to confer sensitivity to azoles. Among these were the membrane trafficking-related TVP18, HFI1 involved in gene expression and YPR090w encoding a hypothetical protein (13Flaherty P. Giaever G. Kumm J. Jordan M.I. Arkin A.P. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which were also identified as miconazole tolerance genes in this study. Because miconazole induces ROS in susceptible fungi, it is surprising that none of the genes encoding proteins involved in (i) antioxidant functions, such as peroxidases, catalases, and glutaredoxin, (ii) mitochondrial function, including protein synthesis, respiration, and mitochondrial genome maintenance, or (iii) specific oxidative stress transcription factors were identified as miconazole tolerance genes. However, we recently performed a similar screen on solid medium for miconazole hypersensitivity in yeast. 7I. E. J. A. François, unpublished data. In this genome-wide screen, yeast mutants with at least 4-fold increased miconazole hypersensitivity were retained. Interestingly, in this screen, 30% of the identified miconazole tolerance genes were involved in mitochondrial function. Whether differences in oxygen tension between screening of yeast mutants on solid and liquid media account for the different sets of miconazole tolerance genes is currently under investigation. The fraction of miconazole tolerance genes implicated in gene expression (27.5%) probably represents general stress tolerance mechanisms. In this respect, yeast mutants affected in genes involved in DNA synthesis and repair, transcription, and chromatin structure (including ADA/Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) histone acetyltransferase complexes or SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex) were previously identified as hypersensitive to a variety of stresses, including oxidative and chemical stress (14Jain P. Akula I. Edlind T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3195-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Thorpe G.W. Fong C.S. Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6564-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 16Tucker C.L. Fields S. Comp. Funct. Genom. 2004; 5: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This finding highlights the requirement for de novo transcription in response to environmental stress. In accordance with the above genetic data, histone deacetylase inhibitors like trichostatin A have been shown to enhance C. albicans sensitivity to azoles (17Smith W.L. Edlind T.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3532-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Regarding the importance of tryptophan biosynthesis for miconazole tolerance, we could demonstrate a specific antagonism between Trp and miconazole action. Other aromatic amino acids like tyrosine and phenylalanine are not able to protect yeast cells against miconazole antifungal action. Various studies have postulated a general role for Trp in antifungal resistance. Trp was shown to mitigate the antifungal activity of ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory agent with antifungal action, and of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, an immunosuppressant with antifungal activity (16Tucker C.L. Fields S. Comp. Funct. Genom. 2004; 5: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also found the calcineurin cnb1 deletion mutant to be hypersensitive to miconazole, as was previously demonstrated by Edlind et al. (19Edlind T. Smith L. Henry K. Katiyar S. Nickels J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how Trp can protect yeast cells against various stresses. In accordance with the observed importance for membrane trafficking and regulation of actin cytoskeleton in miconazole tolerance, we could demonstrate a synergy between miconazole and an inhibitor of endocytosis (C5235236) in yeast. The obtained data with S. cerevisiae implicate that efficient antifungal therapy could consist of miconazole in combination with an endocytosis inhibitor. Indeed, our observations with S. cerevisiae appear to have direct relevance to the human pathogen C. albicans; we demonstrate a synergy between miconazole and C5235236 on this opportunistic pathogen. These data corroborate the very recent findings of Cornet et al. (20Cornet M. Gaillardin C. Richard M.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 3492-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), who demonstrate that deletion of two endocytic components in C. albicans lead to azole hypersensitivity. Although C5235236 (5Toenjes K.A. Munsee S.M. Ibrahim A.S. Jeffrey R. Edwards J.E. Johnson D.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is cytotoxic, it should be possible to identify derivatives that are acceptable in this respect. Whether such (micon)azole combinatorial antifungal therapy is efficient in vivo needs to be investigated further. Because miconazole induces ROS generation in susceptible fungi and actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in mitochondrial activity and regulation of endogenous ROS levels and apoptosis in yeast (6Gourlay C.W. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Gourlay C.W. Du W. Ayscough K.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we further focused on a putative effect of miconazole on actin cytoskeleton organization. Interestingly, we could demonstrate that miconazole induces changes in actin cytoskeleton indicative of increased filament stability. Similar actin cytoskeleton changes were observed in miconazole-hypersensitive mutants impaired in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, pointing to the importance for the actin cytoskeleton in miconazole toxicity. The actin filament stabilization was induced by miconazole prior to its ROS induction. This finding is in agreement with the model that increased actin stability can act as a trigger for ROS induction and apoptosis in yeast (6Gourlay C.W. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Gourlay C.W. Carpp L.N. Timpson P. Winder S.J. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In this respect, the observed nuclear fragmentation in some miconazole-treated yeast cells further points to apoptosis induction by miconazole. Assays such as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) or annexin V staining (for detection of DNA fragmentation phosphatidylserine flip-flop at the plasma membrane, respectively) (12Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) could now be used to substantiate our findings further. The induction of apoptosis in yeast by antifungal azoles has never been described before. Moreover, fluconazole toxicity was previously found not to depend on oxidative stress or apoptotic effector mechanisms in yeast (22Kontoyiannis D.P. Murray P.J. Mycoses. 2002; 46: 183-186Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). There is only one other report on an antifungal drug affecting the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, namely jasplakinolide (23Ayscough K.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1587-1590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Jasplakinolide is an antifungal cyclodepsipeptide that induces F-actin stability and prevents turnover such that all actin becomes incorporated in a single large F-actin clump. Jasplakinolide has also been observed to induce ROS (and apoptosis) in S. cerevisiae (9Gourlay C.W. Carpp L.N. Timpson P. Winder S.J. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this is the first report describing an effect of an azole on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in yeast, resulting in actin clumping prior to induction of endogenous ROS and cell death. This ROS accumulation is most likely the result of dysfunctional mitochondria. Such actin-mediated ROS production possibly involves Ras activation (21Gourlay C.W. Du W. Ayscough K.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In yeast, Ras activation leads to cAMP production and activation of protein kinase A. A link between cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and miconazole sensitivity in yeast has previously been reported (14Jain P. Akula I. Edlind T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3195-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); it was demonstrated that yeast mutants affected in cAMP-PKA signaling were hypersensitive toward miconazole and the observed miconazole hypersensitivity of these mutants could be partially restored by exogenous addition of cAMP (14Jain P. Akula I. Edlind T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3195-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whether miconazole activates Ras signaling in yeast, resulting in elevated cAMP levels and ROS levels via actin-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, needs to be investigated further."

Some intruders can be dispatched by the humoral immune system alone, but many must be phagocytosed by individual hemocytes or encapsulated by interacting hemocytes. Surface proteins of hemocytes control the abrupt transition of hemocytes from resting, nonadherent cells to activated, adherent cells during these cell-mediated responses. Two of these surface proteins, an integrin and a tetraspanin, interact during this adhesive transition. As demonstrated with a hemocyte adhesion assay and a surface plasmon resonance assay, the large extracellular loop of tetraspanin D76 binds to a hemocyte-specific integrin of Manduca sexta. The interaction between the large extracellular loop domain and hemocyte-specific integrin is interrupted not only by a monoclonal antibody (MS13) that binds to a domain of β-integrin known to be a ligand-binding site for cell adhesion but also by double-stranded β-integrin RNA. Transfected S2 cells expressing tetraspanin mediate adhesion of hemocytes. A monoclonal antibody to tetraspanin D76 perturbs the cell-mediated immune response of encapsulation.

These studies involving antibody blocking, RNA interference, and binding assays imply a trans interaction of integrin and tetraspanin on hemocyte surfaces. Cell-mediated responses of innate immune systems involve transitions between resting, nonadherent states of immune cells and their activated, adherent states. Although detailed knowledge of the involvement of adhesion receptors in these transitions exists for cells of the mammalian immune system, comparable information on the cell-mediated responses of invertebrate immune systems is very limited. For example, in vertebrates, integrins and tetraspanins mediate many cellular interactions during immune responses (1Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1189-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 3Maecker H.T. Todd S.C.

Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar); however, the functions of integrins on insect immune cells or hemocytes have only recently been examined (6Lavine M.D. Strand M.R. Insect Mol. Biol. 2003; 12: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Levin D.M. Breuer L.N. Zhuang S. Anderson S.A. Nardi J.B. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Microbiol. 2005; 7: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and the interactions of these integrins with other surface proteins of hemocytes such as tetraspanins have not been investigated. Integrins are cell surface heterodimers that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Each integrin heterodimer is composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits. The extracellular regions of both subunits combine to form a ligand-binding site (10Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6892) Google Scholar, 11Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L.

Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In mammals, products of eight integrin-β genes and 18 integrin-α genes are known to form 24 distinct integrins. Each of these integrins binds to different ligands. These multiple integrins have diverse roles in development, immunity, homeostasis, leukocyte trafficking, and metastasis (13Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3834) Google Scholar, 14Springer T.A. Wang J.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 68: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Among the invertebrates, integrin subunits have been identified in six phyla as follows: sponges, cnidarians, nematodes, mollusks, echinoderms, and arthropods. The functions of these integrins, however, have only been well characterized in Drosophila (15Hughes A.L. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), in which the five α subunits and two β subunits are known to combine in at least three heterodimers: α-PS1, α-PS2, α-PS3 with β-PS. Drosophila integrins are expressed in a variety of cells during embryonic and larval development and bind to ligands of extracellular matrices such as laminin and tiggrin (16Brower D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the function of integrins in hemocytes is not well understood. Among the arthropods, integrins are known to be expressed by hemocytes of crayfish (17Holmblad T. Thornqvist P.O. Soöderhaöll K. Johansson M.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1997; 277: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and by hemocytes of a few insects that include Drosophila melanogaster (9Irving P. Ubeda J.M. Doucet D. Troxler L. Lagueux M. Zachary D. Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Meister M. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (8Moita L.F. Vriend G. Mahairaki V. Louis C. Kafatos F.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 36: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and two lepidopteran species, Pseudoplusia includens (6Lavine M.D. Strand M.R. Insect Mol. Biol. 2003; 12: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Manduca sexta (7Levin D.M. Breuer L.N. Zhuang S. Anderson S.A. Nardi J.B. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mammalian integrins interact through their α chains with cell surface tetraspanins. These latter proteins are integral membrane proteins that have been implicated in regulating cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (1Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 19Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Tetraspanins interact with several different types of transmembrane proteins to organize their lateral position in the membrane. Mammalian integrins such as α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and α7β can form detergent-resistant complexes with tetraspanin proteins, and their association with tetraspanins can enhance the ligand binding activity of the integrins (21Lammerding J. Kazarov A.R. Huang H. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7616-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Nishiuchi R. Sanzen N. Nada S. Sumida Y. Wada Y. Okada M. Takagi J. Hasegawa H. Sekiguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although most interactions of mammalian tetraspanins are known to occur within membranes (cis interactions) rather than as trans interactions with soluble ligands or ligands on opposing cells, one tetraspanin, CD81, is apparently a receptor for the hepatitis virus envelope glycoprotein E2 (22Nishiuchi R. Sanzen N. Nada S. Sumida Y. Wada Y. Okada M. Takagi J. Hasegawa H. Sekiguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Flint M. Maidens C.

Integrins and tetraspanins occur together in insect cells (24Todres E. Nardi J.B. Robertson H.M. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and tetraspanins clearly influence development of Drosophila, but their interactions and potential functions in cell-mediated immune responses of hemocytes have not been addressed. The cell-mediated responses of insects include sealing of wounds, hemolymph clotting, phagocytosis, nodulation of bacteria, and encapsulation of parasitoids, all of which involve regulated hemocyte adhesion (25Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 26Lavine M.D. Strand M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1295-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). An integrin β subunit that is expressed specifically in M. sexta hemocytes functions in hemocyte adhesion and encapsulation (7Levin D.M. Breuer L.N. Zhuang S. Anderson S.A. Nardi J.B. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Wiegand C. Levin D. Gillespie J. Willott E. Kanost M. Trenczek T. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 45: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We describe here an α subunit that pairs with this β subunit to form a hemocyte-specific integrin (HS-integrin) 2The abbreviations used are: HS-integrin hemocyte-specific integrin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; LEL, large extracellular loop; HS, hemocyte-specific; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; RNAi, RNA interference; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. and provide results indicating that a tetraspanin of M. sexta (D76) that is expressed mainly on hemocytes (24Todres E. Nardi J.B. Robertson H.M. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) is a ligand for this integrin and likewise functions in the cell-mediated responses of the immune cells. Insect Rearing—A laboratory colony of M. sexta was originally started from eggs purchased from Carolina Biological Supply Co. Larvae were reared on an artificial diet at a constant temperature of 26 °C and a constant photoperiod of 16 h light, 8 h dark (28Dunn P.E. Drake D. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1983; 41: 77-85Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Monoclonal Antibodies—Two of the monoclonal antibodies that recognize antigens of M. sexta hemocytes were generated by Willottt et al. (29Willott E. Trenczek T. Thrower L.W. Kanost M.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar), MS2 and MS13. The antibody MS13 recognizes β1-integrin (7Levin D.M. Breuer L.N. Zhuang S. Anderson S.A. Nardi J.B. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The antigen recognized by MS2 is not known; however, this antibody specifically labels granular cells. A monoclonal antibody (mAb 1G2) was more recently generated to a recombinant extracellular domain of tetraspanin D76 (amino acid residues 111–217). To purify and concentrate these antibodies from culture medium, cultures of hybridoma cells were grown in modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for ∼6 weeks. All cultures were maintained in a bioreactor (Integra). Culture supernatants were concentrated by precipitation with saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dialyzed against PBS to remove all traces of ammonium sulfate. MS2, MS13, and mAb 1G2 were further purified by passage over a rec-Protein A column (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Protein Purification and Analysis—HS-integrin was purified from hemocytes of day 3 fifth instar larvae by immunoaffinity chromatography. First, hemolymph was collected from the severed dorsal horns of 150 larvae into 150 ml of anticoagulant saline (29Willott E. Trenczek T. Thrower L.W. Kanost M.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 500 × g, room temperature, the hemocyte pellet was stored at -70 °C. To solubilize membrane proteins of hemocytes, the pellet was thawed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation in 100 mm octyl glucoside, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 with the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a column containing anti-β1-integrin (MS13) covalently coupled to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the integrin was eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.0), 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The pH of each ml of eluted material was neutralized by addition of 60 μl of 1.0 m Tris (pH 8.0). The solution was concentrated by filtration through an Amicon Centriplus YM-30 membrane (Millipore). After separation of this sample (5 μg) by SDS-PAGE, the band representing the integrin α subunit was excised from the gel for analysis of tryptic peptides by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at the University of Missouri Columbia Proteomics Center. Edman sequencing of selected peptides was performed at the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University. Analysis of mass spectra for comparison with sequences encoded by the cloned cDNA was carried out using the MS-Digest program of ProteinProspector version 4.0.5. To express a His6-tagged protein representing the predicted large extracellular loop (LEL, amino acid residues 111–217) of M. sexta tetraspanin D76 (24Todres E. Nardi J.B. Robertson H.M. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a cDNA fragment encoding this region was inserted in plasmid vector pBAD/gIII (Invitrogen) at 5′ NcoI and 3′ XbaI restriction sites, and the resulting plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21-AI. Expression was carried out by culturing these bacteria in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) until the A450 reached 0.8, and then for another 4 h in the presence of 2% arabinose and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 25 min), and the pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. After the cells were disrupted by sonication, they were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 20 min), and the insoluble material containing the recombinant protein was dissolved in 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole and centrifuged again (12,000 × g, 20 min). The resulting supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA column. After washing the column with 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, recombinant D76-LEL was eluted with the same buffer except that 250 mm imidazole replaced 20 mm imidazole. The denatured protein was refolded by dialysis against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol at 4 °C overnight. Any precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min), and the sample was again applied to the Ni-NTA column. After this second addition, the column was washed with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol. The same buffer with 200 mm imidazole replacing 20 mm imidazole was used for elution. Fractions containing LEL-D76 (detected by immunoblotting with anti-His6 mAb) were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant was concentrated using Amicon Centriplus YM-10 concentrators (Millipore). Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Bradford assay (Pierce), and purified proteins were then stored at -80 °C. S2 Cell Culture and Transfections—Drosophila S2 cells were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider’s insect medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). A cDNA encoding full-length tetraspanin D76, including its own secretion signal peptide, was inserted into plasmid vector pMT/V5-His A (Invitrogen) and used for transfection of S2 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. A stable cell line containing this construct was selected by culture in Schneider’s Drosophila medium containing blasticidin. S2 cells transfected with pMT/V5-HisA lacking an insert were maintained for use in control experiments. cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis—Degenerate primers were designed based on the following: 1) a peptide sequence obtained from immunoaffinity purification of the HS-integrin α subunit; 2) a sequence that is conserved in α-integrins (DLLVGAP). These primers were used for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The following primers based on peptide sequences 1 and 2 above were used for RT-PCR: 1) forward 5′-GAY YTI YTI GTI GGI GCI CC-3′; reverse 5′-CK IGC YTG DAT RTT RTA RAA-3′. The following conditions were chosen for RT-PCR using these primers along with total RNA from fifth instar larval hemocytes as template: Powerscript (Clontech)/Platinum Taq polymerase under thermocycler conditions of 42 °C, 90 min; 94 °C, 2 min, followed by five cycles of 94 °C, 30 s, 45 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 1 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s, 45 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 1 min; and with a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product was cloned in a pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To obtain a full-length cDNA sequence, 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was employed using the GeneRacer kit version E (Invitrogen) along with hemocyte total RNA and four primers based on the partial cDNA sequence obtained above. The PCR products for 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE were cloned in a pCR4-TOPO vector and sequenced. To confirm these RACE results, RT-PCR was performed using primers from the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of the α-integrin mRNA. The product was cloned in pCR4-TOPO, and its DNA sequence was determined. Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using the ClustalW program. Location of a signal peptide was predicted using SignalP 3.0. Cell Adhesion Assay—Adhesion of cells to wells of microtiter plates was measured by assaying the endogenous acid phosphatase activity of adherent cells (30Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). D76-LEL, recombinant glutathione transferase (GST), or His6-tagged tyrosine hydroxylase of M. sexta (each at 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) were used to coat wells of a 96-well plate (Corning Costar, 3590). Aliquots of D76-LEL, GST, or tyrosine hydroxylase were added to each well and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plate was blocked the next day for 1 h at room temperature with the buffers indicated under “Results” containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Hemocytes were collected in anticoagulant saline, centrifuged at 500 × g for 8 min, and washed twice with buffers containing 0.5% BSA. Cells were suspended in adhesion buffer (10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 75 mm sucrose, 0.5% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MnCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and 200-μl aliquots of the suspension were added to wells and incubated for 30 min at 26 °C. The plate was then washed four to five times with adhesion buffer, followed by addition of 100 μl of acid phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (5 mg/ml) and 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5). The adherent cells were incubated with this substrate for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1.0 m NaOH, and absorbance was measured at 410 nm. Adhesion of hemocytes to S2 cells expressing tetraspanin D76 was assayed with a method adapted from Weber et al. (31Weber C. Kitayama J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10939-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For this S2 cell static-adhesion assay, 0.5 ml of stably transformed S2 cells (5 × 106/ml) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in each well of a 24-well plate in a binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MnCl2, 0.5% BSA). The plate was subsequently blocked for 1 h with binding buffer containing 5% BSA instead of 0.5% BSA. Hemocytes (0.5 ml, 1 × 106/ml) that had been labeled with 5 μm calcein-orange (Molecular Probes) and suspended in binding buffer were incubated with the attached S2 cells for 30 min at room temperature. Each well was then washed twice with binding buffer before addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and transfer to a 96-well plate for measurement of fluorescence (577 nm excitation, 590 nm emission) with a CaryEclipse (Varian) plate reader. In some experiments, S2 cells were preincubated for 10 min with 5 μg/ml anti-tetraspanin, or hemocytes were preincubated with 5 μg/ml anti-β1-integrin. SPR Measurements—Measurements of kinetic interactions between HS-integrin and D76-LEL were performed using a BIAcore 3000 SPR biosensor (BIAcore AB) following the methods of Yan et al. (32Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Smith et al. (33Smith J.W. Hu D. Satterthwait A. Pinz-Sweeney S. Barbas C.F. II I J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32788-32795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. As a control to account for nonspecific interactions, a recombinant protein representing the six immunoglobulin domains of M. sexta neuroglian (34Nardi J.B. Pilas B. Bee C.M. Zhuang S. Garsha K. Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2006; 30: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was similarly coupled to a different flow cell of the CM5 sensor chip. Different concentrations of D76-LEL were prepared in three binding buffers that differed only in their concentrations of Mn2+ as follows: 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, with 0, 0.4, or 1 mm MnCl2. These protein solutions were injected over the surface of the sensor chip at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. At the end of each cycle, surfaces of the sensor chips were regenerated by injection of 0.1 m HCl at the same flow rate. Both association rate constants (ka) and dissociation rate constants (kd) were obtained by fitting background-subtracted SPR binding data to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model within the BIAevaluation software version 4.0. RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was prepared from a template that consisted of a 468-bp PCR product amplified from the M. sexta integrin-α1 cDNA (nucleotides 1039–1506), using primers that each contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence at their 5′ ends. The sequences for these primers are as follows: forward primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCGCAATCATAAGTGTCGGC-3′; reverse primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACGTCCGGGTGTTTAATTTGG-3′. The PCR product was used as template for preparation of dsRNA using MEGAscript® RNAi kit (Ambion), following its isolation and extraction after agarose gel electrophoresis. Double-stranded RNA of the M. sexta β1-integrin subunit was prepared as described previously (7Levin D.M. Breuer L.N. Zhuang S. Anderson S.A. Nardi J.B. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) dsRNA that was used as a control was purchased from Dharmacon. Fourth instar larvae were injected in the abdominal hemocoel with 5 μg of each dsRNA. When these larvae reached the 3rd day of the fifth larval stadium, hemocytes were collected in anticoagulant saline from an incision of their dorsal horn to assess integrin expression level and to assay cell adhesion. Bacterial Clearance Assay—Effects of antibodies to M. sexta β1-integrin and tetraspanin D76 on bacterial clearance in vivo were investigated using an assay described previously (35Yu X.Q. Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On day 2 of the fifth larval stadium, M. sexta were injected with 50 μl of PBS, 50 μg of mouse IgG (Sigma), 50 μg of MS13 (anti-β1-integrin), or 50 μg of mAb 1G2 (anti-tetraspanin D76). One hour later these larvae were injected with ∼106 colony-forming units of a suspension of Serratia marcescens (ATCC 8195) suspended in 50 μl of PBS. At 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after injection of bacteria, samples of hemolymph were collected, diluted, and cultured on LB agar plates. Each plate was scored for the number of bacterial colonies with the red pigment characteristic of this particular bacterial strain. Encapsulation Assay—Larvae on the 2nd day of the fifth larval stadium were injected with either 100 μg of mouse IgG or mAb 1G2. One hour later, these larvae were injected with a suspension of ∼100 DEAE-Sephadex beads in 100 μl of PBS that had been stained with Congo Red. Beads were recovered from dissected larvae 24 h after injection and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde that had been dissolved in PBS. Beads were scored for encapsulation using phase contrast microscopy (7Levin D.M. Breuer L.N. Zhuang S. Anderson S.A. Nardi J.B. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting, Immunofluorescence, and Flow Cytometry—For immunoblotting, 40 ng of D76-LEL was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, incubated with anti-His antibody (Qiagen) at a 1:2000 dilution, and developed with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated substrate kit (Bio-Rad). For flow cytometry, hemocytes were fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS and washed three times with PBS before being incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a blocking buffer consisting of PBS with 5% BSA. Monoclonal antibody or mouse IgG were added to the blocking buffer at 1 μg/ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with blocking buffer, hemocytes were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and then washed three more times with blocking buffer. A FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for analysis of hemocyte labeling. For immunofluorescence microscopy, hemocytes were washed twice with anticoagulant saline before being transferred to Grace’s medium plus 20% fetal bovine serum. Hemocytes were allowed to settle on a number 1 cover glass for 60 min. At the end of this culture period, the cells were fixed and rinsed with PBS as described above. Fixed cells were blocked for at least 30 min with PBS containing 5% goat serum without any nonionic detergent that permeabilizes cells. To this blocking buffer was added anti-tetraspanin (1:2000). The hemocytes were labeled overnight at 4 °C with this primary antibody and rinsed three times with blocking buffer the next day. A secondary goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to FITC (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was diluted 1:50 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the hemocytes. The cells were washed with blocking buffer three more times before being incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated anti-β1-integrin. After rinsing the cells several times the next day with blocking buffer, Texas Red-avidin D (1:1000) was added. After hemocytes were exposed to this second label at 4 °C overnight, they were labeled with 1:1000 dilution of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stock solution (1 mg/ml) in a permeabilizing blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, rinsed three final times with blocking buffer, and then mounted on slides with Tris/glycerol/n-propyl gallate (30:70:0.35). RT-PCR and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from hemocytes with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of this RNA using Powerscript reverse transcriptase (Clonte"
https://openalex.org/W2061947506,"We demonstrate that photoexcitation of NAD(P)H reduces heme iron of Mycobacterium tuberculosis P450s CYP121 and CYP51B1 on the microsecond time scale. Rates of formation for the ferrous-carbonmonoxy (FeII-CO) complex were determined across a range of coenzyme/CO concentrations. CYP121 reaction transients were biphasic. A hyperbolic dependence on CO concentration was observed, consistent with the presence of a CO binding site in ferric CYP121. CYP51B1 absorption transients for FeII-CO complex formation were monophasic. The reaction rate was second order with respect to [CO], suggesting the absence of a CO-binding site in ferric CYP51B1. In the absence of CO, heme iron reduction by photoexcited NAD(P)H is fast (∼10,000–11,000 s–1) with both P450s. For CYP121, transients revealed initial production of the thiolate-coordinated (P450) complex (absorbance maximum at 448 nm), followed by a slower phase reporting partial conversion to the thiol-coordinated P420 species (at 420 nm). The slow phase amplitude increased at lower pH values, consistent with heme cysteinate protonation underlying the transition. Thus, CO binding occurs to the thiolate-coordinated ferrous form prior to cysteinate protonation. For CYP51B1, slow conversions of both the ferrous/FeII-CO forms to species with spectral maxima at 423/421.5 nm occurred following photoexcitation in the absence/presence of CO. This reflected conversion from ferrous thiolate- to thiol-coordinated forms in both cases, indicating instability of the thiolate-coordinated ferrous CYP51B1. CYP121 FeII-CO complex pH titrations revealed reversible spectral transitions between P450 and P420 forms. Our data provide strong evidence for P420 formation linked to reversible heme thiolate protonation, and demonstrate key differences in heme chemistry and CO binding for CYP121 and CYP51B1.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), 3The abbreviations used are: MtbMycobacterium tuberculosisCYPcytochrome P450. the bacterium that causes tuberculosis in humans, has made a dramatic global resurgence in recent years.

The genome sequence of Mtb was determined by Cole and co-workers in 1998 (2Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry C.E. II I Tekaia F.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar), and revealed several important aspects of the physiology and biochemistry of the bacterium. One of the most surprising features was the presence of 20 different genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. The repertoire of CYP enzymes included the first prokaryotic example of a sterol demethylase P450 (CYP51) (3Aoyama Y. Horiuchi T. Gotoh O. Noshiro M. Yoshida Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 694-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Bellamine A. Mangla A.T. Nes W.D. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8937-8942Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic CYP51 enzymes catalyze the oxidative demethylation of sterol substrates leading to removal of the 14α-methyl group. In mammals, the favored substrates are lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol in the pathway leading to cholesterol synthesis. In yeasts and fungi the membrane sterol ergosterol is the product of the pathway (5Waterman M.R. Lepesheva G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, fungal CYP51 is the target for the azole and triazole classes of antibiotics (6Lepesheva G.I. Waterman M.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 215: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whereas it appears unlikely that the Mtb CYP51 enzyme (formally classified as CYP51B1 in the P450 gene superfamily) is a bona fide azole drug target in Mtb, various azole drugs have been shown to possess potent antimycobacterial activity, and the drug econazole was found to be highly effective in removing Mtb from the lungs and spleen of infected mice (7McLean K.J.

However, another Mtb P450 (CYP121) also exhibits very tight binding of a range of azole drugs, and this P450 isoform may be an essential Mtb gene and a potential azole drug target enzyme (11McLean K.J.

Of particular interest is the nature of the carbon monoxide (CO) complexes formed by these two P450s. The ferrous-CO (FeII-CO) complex in this enzyme class usually has its main absorption (Soret) maximum at a wavelength close to 450 nm, and this “Pigment 450” provides the name for the P450 enzyme superfamily (17Estabrook R.W. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 1461-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The Soret shift from ∼418 nm (for ferric, low-spin enzyme) to ∼450 nm (for the FeII-CO complex) is a hallmark of the P450s and is associated with a thiolate (cysteinate) proximal ligand to the heme iron (Cys345 in Mtb CYP121, Cys394 in Mtb CYP51B1). Protonation of the thiolate to a thiol is associated with a Soret absorption shift to ∼420 nm for the FeII-CO complex (18Perera R. Sono M. Sigman J.A. Pfister T.D. Lu Y. Dawson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3641-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This “P420” form is commonly considered an inactivated form of P450 enzymes, and can be formed by disrupting enzyme structure using, e.g. chaotropic reagents (19Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Coggins J.R. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, recent studies of the Sorangium cellulosum P450epoK (CYP167A1) indicate that the time-dependent conversion of the P450 FeII-CO complex to the P420 form can be reversed in the presence of the substrate epothilone D, leading to “substrate-mediated rescue” of the inactivated protein and formation of substantial amounts of the P450 form with an absorbance maximum at 446 nm (20Ogura H.

Studies of CYP51B1 also showed that an irreversible time-dependent conversion of P450 to P420 occurred following FeII-CO complex formation, but this process could be dramatically slowed if the protein was bound to a substrate analogue (estriol) (16Mclean K.J. Warman A.J. Seward H.E. Marshall K.R. Girvan H.M. Cheesman M.R. Waterman M.R. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8427-8443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The FeII-CO complex of CYP121 (formed by bubbling CO into a solution of sodium dithionite-reduced enzyme) also displays a substantial component of P420 at neutral pH, although the P450/P420 FeII-CO ratio is quite stable following complex formation in this case. Recently, we exploited laser photoexcitation of NAD(P)H to achieve rapid reduction of the Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) enzyme on a microsecond time scale, and to measure kinetics of CO binding to the protein (21Girvan H.M. Heyes D.J. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6447-6453Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have now exploited this method to analyze the kinetics of P450 reduction, FeII-CO complex formation, and the P450 to P420 collapse in the Mtb CYP51B1 and CYP121 P450s. In this work, we demonstrate, for both enzymes, that the P450 FeII-CO complex is formed rapidly on laser photoexcitation of the oxidized enzyme in the presence of CO. This is followed by a slower process of conversion to P420, demonstrating that the heme thiolate protonation is a consequence of heme iron reduction and/or CO coordination, and that there is no significant amount of thiol coordination of ferric heme iron in the resting forms of either P450. Markedly different kinetic properties and CO concentration dependence was observed for CYP121 and CYP51B1 FeII-CO complex formation, suggesting distinctive modes of CO association with these enzymes. We also demonstrate that the CYP121 P450/P420 equilibrium is reversible and exquisitely pH-dependent, reinforcing the importance of thiolate protonation in the formation of the cytochrome P420 species. Expression and Purification of CYP121—The Mtb Rv2276 gene encoding the CYP121 protein was produced from E. coli HMS174(DE3)/pKM2b transformants (11McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transformant cells (typically 10 liters) were grown in LB medium at 30 °C until A600 = 0.4–0.6. isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm) was then added to induce CYP121 expression, growth temperature was decreased to 18 °C, and culture was continued for a further 24 h. Cells were harvested and disrupted as described previously (11McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CYP121 was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation (30–70% fraction retained), followed by successive column chromatography steps on phenyl-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite resins according to established protocols (11McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Pure CYP121 was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep 30, Millipore) and exchanged into 100 mm potassium phosphate (potassium Pi, pH 7.0) (buffer A) plus glycerol (50% v/v) by dialysis, prior to storage of pure P450 at −80 °C. Purity of CYP121 was assessed by spectral properties (ratio of Soret absorption at 416.5 nm to protein-specific absorption at 280 nm, with an A416.5:A280 ratio of >1.8 indicating pure protein), and by SDS-PAGE analysis of protein samples (on 10% denaturing gels). CYP121 concentration was determined from the Soret absorption of the ferric enzyme in its ligand-free low-spin state using ϵ416.5 = 95 mm–1 cm–1, as described previously (11McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of CYP51B1—The Mtb Rv0764c gene encoding the CYP51B1 was also expressed in E. coli strain HMS174(DE3) using a pET20b (Novagen) plasmid system, as described previously (16Mclean K.J. Warman A.J. Seward H.E. Marshall K.R. Girvan H.M. Cheesman M.R. Waterman M.R. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8427-8443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CYP51B1 purity was established by SDS-PAGE analysis, and from the Soret A418:A280 ratio for the purified ferric enzyme. An A418:A280 ratio of ∼1.8 indicated pure CYP51B1. Purified CYP51B1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration (to >500 μm, using a Centriprep 30), dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and stored at −80 °C until required. CYP51B1 concentration was determined using ϵ419 = 134 mm–1 cm–1 for the oxidized enzyme, as described previously (16Mclean K.J. Warman A.J. Seward H.E. Marshall K.R. Girvan H.M. Cheesman M.R. Waterman M.R. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8427-8443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Laser Flash Excitation of CYP121/CYP51B1—Prior to use in laser excitation experiments, CYP51B1 and CYP121 samples were exchanged into buffer A by passage through a PD-10 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with anaerobic buffer A. Buffers were made anaerobic by extensive bubbling with oxygen-free nitrogen, prior to incubation in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology, Portesham, UK), with oxygen levels maintained at <2 ppm. All laser excitation experiments were done in sealed, air-tight quartz cuvettes. For laser photoexcitation experiments, 1-ml samples of CYP121 or CYP51B1 enzymes (typically 3–6 μm in buffer A for data collection over time bases of >1 ms, or 10 μm for data collection over time bases of <1 ms) were excited using the 3rd harmonic (355 nm) of a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser (Brilliant B, Quantel) in a sealed quartz cuvette of 1-cm path length. The energy output of each laser pulse was up to 200 millijoules and pulses were 6–8 ns in duration. Other components of the various reaction mixtures used were pyridine nucleotide coenzymes (NADH or NADPH in the range from 0 to 500 μm), the CYP51B1 substrate analogue estriol (used at a final concentration of 50 μm; higher concentrations were avoided to optimize data quality) (16Mclean K.J. Warman A.J. Seward H.E. Marshall K.R. Girvan H.M. Cheesman M.R. Waterman M.R. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8427-8443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and carbon monoxide (CO, used across the concentration range from 0 to 975 μm, where the latter is saturating in solution at atmospheric pressure and 298 K) (22Cargill R. Carbon Monoxide. 43. Pergamon Press, Oxford1990: 5-30Google Scholar). Spectral transients were recorded at a variety of wavelengths to follow coenzyme oxidation, CYP121 and CYP51B1 heme iron reduction and FeII-CO complex formation. These included 340 (Δϵ340 = 6210 m–1 cm–1 for the oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+), 416–419 (near the Soret absorbance maximum for low-spin CYP121 and CYP51B1), 410 (at the Soret peak for ferrous CYP121), 423 (at the Soret maximum for reduced, thiol-coordinated CYP51B1) (Fig. 1A), 550 and 559 (to monitor changes in the visible bands of the P450 hemes), and 450/420 nm (to follow formation/decay of the corresponding FeII-CO complexes). Development of a peak at ∼450 nm is characteristic of native (thiolate-coordinated) FeII-CO complexes of the P450s, where Δϵ450–490 = 91,000 m–1 cm–1 for the difference spectrum generated by subtraction of the spectrum for ferrous [FeII] P450 from that for its FeII-CO complex (23Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel experiments were performed for enzyme samples in the presence and absence of CO. Data collection was made using an Applied Photophysics LKS-60 flash photolysis instrument with a detection system at right angles to the incident laser beam. The probe light (150 watts xenon lamp) was passed through a monochromator before and after passage through the sample. Absorbance changes were measured using a photomultiplier tube and kinetic transients were typically collected from 50 ms up to 10 s. Photodiode array spectral data were also collected for slow reaction phases, and for data reporting on the conversions between P450 and P420 FeII-CO enzyme forms. Multiple kinetic traces for each sample were measured and averaged prior to data analysis. Optical spectra were recorded before and after laser photoexcitation to ensure protein integrity. Transients were recorded at 25 °C. For measurements over faster time scales (typically <1 ms), the output of the xenon arc lamp was pulsed using a xenon arc pulser (Applied Photophysics) and transients were measured using an Infiniium oscilloscope model number 54830B (Agilent Technologies). Absorbance spectra were measured before and after laser photoexcitation by transferring the cuvette to a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) and recording data between 300 and 800 nm. All other spectral measurements for enzyme quantification and for establishing features of CYP51B1 and CYP121 in ferric substrate-free and substrate-bound forms, the ferrous state, and in the FeII-CO complex were also performed using a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer, either on the bench or under anaerobic conditions in a glove box (Belle Technology, Portesham, UK) for the ferrous enzymes. Data from photoexcitation experiments were analyzed and fitted to appropriate exponential functions using the manufacturer's (Applied Photophysics) kinetics analysis software. All spectral and single wavelength data were transferred to Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) for further analysis. Absorption transients accompanying formation of the Mtb CYP121 FeII-CO complexes were fitted accurately to a standard double exponential function, and rates for each phase (kobs) were plotted versus the concentration of other ligands/substrates varied for any set of experiments (CO or NAD[P]H). In the case of Mtb CYP51B1, reaction transients were fitted accurately by a single exponential function and were plotted as for CYP121. For experiments in which CO concentration was varied, a hyperbolic dependence of the FeII-CO complex formation rate on CO concentration was observed in the case of CYP121. Data were fitted to a hyperbolic function to obtain estimates for the apparent limiting rate constant for FeII-CO complex formation (klim), and for the apparent dissociation constant for the FeIII-CO noncovalent complex. In the case of CYP51B1, a linear dependence of rate constant on CO concentration was obtained and data were fitted accordingly. A pH titration to examine the conversion of the CYP121 FeII-CO complex between P450 and P420 forms was performed by measurement of the absorption spectrum of CYP121 (5.6 μm) in 100 mm potassium Pi, with pH titrated between 6.5 and 10.5 using potassium hydroxide. To show the reversibility of the protonation of the Cys345 thiolate, HCl was added to lower the pH again to 6.5. The reversibility of the P450/P420 transition in this pH range demonstrated that the enzyme and its heme binding site remained intact throughout the titration. Materials—Bacterial growth media (Tryptone, yeast extract) were from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, Suffolk, United Kingdom). All other reagents were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK) and were of the highest grade available. Laser Photoexcitation of CYP121—Spectral features of the Mtb CYP121 enzyme in its oxidized (FeIII), sodium dithionite reduced (FeII), and reduced/carbon monoxide-bound (FeII-CO) forms are shown in Fig. 1B. The ferric enzyme is predominantly low-spin with its Soret band at 416.5 nm. EPR spectroscopy indicated that the ferric enzyme was thiolate coordinated with no sign of any cysteine thiol-coordinated (P420) form (11McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Reduction leads to a shift of the Soret feature to 405 nm, consistent with the retention of thiolate coordination of the heme iron in the ferrous enzyme (11McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The spectral properties of the ferrous enzyme are similar to those observed for the well characterized B. megaterium P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) and Pseudomonas putida (CYP101A1) enzymes (24Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Rospendowski B.N. Smith W.E. McKnight J.E. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Sligar S.G. Gunsalus I.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the FeII-CO complex, the Soret band is split between two features at 448 and 420 nm, with the latter being of much greater intensity at neutral pH. These data suggest that the proximal ligand (Cys345)is predominantly protonated to the thiol form in the FeII-CO complex under these conditions. To analyze the kinetics of formation of the CYP121 FeII-CO complex, we performed laser photoexcitation studies using NAD(P)H as electron donor, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2A shows a typical transient collected at 450 nm (i.e. close to the absorption maximum of the thiolate-coordinated FeII-CO complex) with NADPH (300 μm) as the electron donor. Reaction transients were found to be biphasic and to fit accurately to a double exponential function, as we observed recently for the P450 BM3 enzyme (21Girvan H.M. Heyes D.J. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6447-6453Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, there was a hyperbolic dependence of FeII-CO complex formation rate on the concentration of CO in the solution (in the range from 0 to 975 μm, where the latter is saturating at 25 °C). There was no apparent dependence of FeII-CO complex formation rate on the coenzyme concentration, with rates determined at individual concentrations of CO being indistinguishable (within error) for NADH and NADPH in the range from 50 to 500 μm. The observed rate constants for formation of the FeII-CO complex (at pH 7.0) at various NAD(P)H concentrations were fitted to a hyperbolic function to obtain limiting rate constants klim = 1887 ± 164 s–1 (NADPH) and 1648 ± 116 s–1 (NADH) from the data for the fast phase of the biphasic reaction transients. The corresponding apparent Kd values for CO were 914 ± 139 μm (with NADPH) and 760 ± 100 μm (with NADH). The slower phases also showed a hyperbolic rate dependence on CO concentration (Fig. 2B). The relatively weak affinity for CO and hyperbolic dependence observed are likely explained in terms of a low affinity site for the CO in the ferric enzyme matrix (see Ref. 21Girvan H.M. Heyes D.J. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6447-6453Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar for detailed discussion). Following reduction of the iron to the ferrous state on laser photoexcitation of NAD(P)H, the CO relocates to the higher affinity site on the heme iron, to form the FeII-CO complex. The biphasic nature of the reaction transients might be explained by the presence of two conformations of the CYP121 protein, or else distinct binding sites for CO in the ferric enzyme. Structural studies of CYP121 indicate a form with a constricted active site, and conformational alterations are expected to facilitate substrate binding and catalysis (12Leys D. Mowat C.G.

In view of the predominance of the P420 form of the CYP121 FeII-CO complex at neutral pH, as evident from spectral analysis (Fig. 1B), we analyzed the evolution of the entire absorption spectrum of the P450 following laser photoexcitation of CYP121 to form the FeII-CO complex (Fig. 3A). The data collected demonstrated clearly that the first species formed has absorption maximum at 448 nm (i.e. the P450 form), but that this collapses progressively over a period of several seconds, with concomitant formation of a species with absorption maximum at 420 nm (i.e. the P420 form). Thus, the data indicate that the thiolate-coordinated P450 FeII-CO complex forms first following CYP121 heme reduction by laser photoexcitation of NAD(P)H in the presence of CO, but that this species is in equilibrium with the thiol-coordinated P420 form. The balance lies in favor of the P420 form at neutral pH, and this form predominates when the system comes to equilibrium. The rate of the P450 to P420 decay process is 0.58 ± 0.06 s–1 at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. The apparent decay rate is not substantially altered at other pH values examined. Laser Photoexcitation of CYP51B1—The spectral features of the Mtb CYP51B1 enzyme in its FeIII, FeII, and FeII-CO forms are shown in Fig. 1A. As with CYP121, CYP51B1 is predominantly low-spin in its ferric state, with Soret maximum at 419 nm. EPR data also demonstrated a thiolate-coordinated P450 heme iron in the substrate-free enzyme (4Bellamine A. Mangla A.T. Nes W.D. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8937-8942Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16Mclean K.J. Warman A.J. Seward H.E. Marshall K.R. Girvan H.M. Cheesman M.R. Waterman M.R. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8427-8443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the FeII-CO complex collapses from the P450 to a P420 form over a period of minutes, and the FeII form also has a spectrum typical of a thiol-coordinated heme iron and comparable with thiol-coordinated heme iron in a H93G mutant of sperm whale myoglobin (3Aoyama Y.

Goldstein P.A. Neuroscience. 2006; 141: 1811-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Knock-out of HCN2 reduces, If in thalamocortical neurons, consistent with the presence of other HCN isoforms in these cells (20Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K. Langebartels A. Wotjak C. Munsch T. Zong X. Feil S. Feil R. Lancel M. Chien K.R. Konnerth A. Pape H.C. Biel M. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Co-assembly of HCN2 and HCN4 is supported by evidence of interaction of the two isoforms in heterologous expression systems. When co-expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, HCN2 and HCN4 were found to colocalize and co-immunoprecipitate, and cell surface fluorescence of an HCN2 trafficking mutant channel was rescued when co-expressed with HCN4 (21Much B.

Reductions in HCN4 current density by co-expression with a nonfunctional HCN2 pore mutant in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (22Er F. Larbig R. Ludwig A. Biel M. Hofmann F. Beuckelmann D.J. Hoppe U.C. Circulation. 2003; 107: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also suggests that HCN2 and HCN4 interact in a physical and/or functional way. Although these data could be explained by co-assembly of HCN2 and HCN4, they can also be readily explained by other interactions. For example, functional and physical associations between ion channel subunits have been reported between voltage-gated potassium channels that are distantly related in primary structure and do not co-assemble. One example is between the human-ether-a-go-go-related gene and KCNQ1, which exist as separate groups of homomeric channels within macromolecular complexes both in native tissue and when overexpressed in mammalian cells (23Ehrlich J.R. Pourrier M. Weerapura M. Ethier N. Marmabachi A.M. Hebert T.E. Nattel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1233-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Together, the data support interactions between HCN2 and HCN4 but do not demonstrate the formation of functional heteromeric channels. Evidence in favor of functional co-assembly of HCN2 and HCN4 in live cells comes from single If channel recordings in co-transfected CHO cells. These single channels possessed intermediate activation kinetics, in theory reflecting contributions from both subunits (24Michels G. Er F. Khan I. Sudkamp M. Herzig S. Hoppe U.C. Circulation. 2005; 111: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, whether the measured channels in that study truly represent HCN channels remains controversial (25DiFrancesco D. Circulation. 2005; 112 (-e73): e72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26DiFrancesco D. Nature. 1986; 324: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 27Johnson Jr., J.P. Zagotta W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2742-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Dekker J.P. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). Among the HCN isoforms that do co-assemble, whether they have a preference for self-assembly (homomerization) over co-assembly (heteromerization) is not known. Because the primary amino acid sequences of the four mammalian HCN isoforms are very similar, it is possible that their abilities to self-assemble or to co-assemble may also be similar. After exclusion of the nonconserved regions of the cytoplasmic N and C termini, the amino acid homology among the four mammalian isoforms is very high (≥94% conserved), and HCN2 and HCN4 isoforms bear the strongest conservation of primary sequence among the four isoforms (≥96% conserved) (29Jackson H.A. Marshall C.R. Accili E.A. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 29: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the differences between HCN2 and HCN4, both those within the conserved region and those within the cytoplasmic N and C termini, could modify the extent to which these isoforms co-assemble under different conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that co-assembly of HCN2 and HCN4 in live CHO cells occurs with equal preference compared with self-assembly, using multiple approaches, including bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2), a novel approach to study the association of ion channel subunits. We also provide evidence in support of co-assembly of HCN2 and HCN4 in the rat thalamus and embryonic mouse heart. Molecular Biology—The construction of an HCN2 C-terminal deletion (lacking the cyclic nucleotide binding domain and the remainder of the C terminus distal to it, HCN2ΔCNBD) and another mutant lacking the entire N terminus was described previously (12Proenza C. Tran N. Angoli D. Zahynacz K. Balcar P. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29634-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Tran N. Proenza C. Macri V. Petigara F. Sloan E. Samler S. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43588-43592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An extracellular HA epitope was inserted between the S3 and S4 transmembrane domain of HCN2ΔCNBD (Fig. 4A). This construct was made by digesting HCN2-HA (kind gift from M. Sanguinetti) at common HCN2 restriction sites, such that the HA tag was removed and placed in HCN2ΔCNBD. For BRET2 constructs, Renilla luciferase (Rluc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags were added to the N-terminal end of HCN2, HCN2ΔN, HCN4, or Kv1.5 cDNA. BRET2 vectors (pRlucC and pGFPC; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were digested at restriction sites complementary to those present on 5′ and 3′ ends of HCN2, HCN2ΔN, HCN4, or Kv1.5, such that the tags were expressed in frame with the channel cDNA when ligated. Resulting sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (DNA sequencing core facility, Vancouver, Canada). All tagged constructs, except those made with HCN2ΔN, which does not form functional channels, were tested by patch clamp electrophysiology and produced currents characteristic of their wild type counterparts (data not shown). Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry, cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes. After 48 h, CHO cells were transiently transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding wild type and/or mutant channels (2 μg/dish) using FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For electrophysiology, cells were also co-transfected with the GFP reporter plasmid for identification using fluorescent microscopy (0.5-0.7 μg/dish). Whole Cell Patch Clamp Electrophysiology and Analysis—One to 2 days following transfection, a shard of coverslip plated with cells was transferred to a recording chamber (∼200-μl volume) and continually perfused (0.5-1.0 ml/min) with a low K+ extracellular solution (5.4 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH to 7.4 with NaOH). Following rupture of the patch membrane, the solution was changed to a high K+ recording solution (135 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH to 7.4 with KOH) to maximize current amplitude. The patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing 130 mm potassium aspartate, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA and adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with KOH. In some experiments, this solution was supplemented with 2 mm cAMP (as noted). Whole cell hyperpolarization-activated currents (If) were measured using borosilicate glass electrodes (Sutter Instrument Co.), which had a resistance of 2.0-4.0 megaohms when filled with the intracellular solution. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Data were filtered at 2 kHz and were analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and Origin (Microcal) software. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (20-22 °C). Currents were not leak-subtracted. The voltage dependence of If activation was determined from tail currents at -65 mV following 2-s test pulses ranging from -50 to -150 mV in 20-mV steps. Normalized tail current amplitudes were plotted as a function of test potential, and values were fit with a Boltzmann function as follows, f(V)=Imax/(1+e(V1/2−V)/k) to determine the midpoint of activation (V½) and slope factor (k). Each test pulse was followed by a 200-500-ms pulse to +5 mV to ensure complete channel deactivation, and the resting current was allowed to return to its base-line value before subsequent voltage pulses. Time constants to assess rates of If activation were generated using a single exponential fitting procedure. An initial delay during If activation was not well described by a single exponential function and therefore was not used in our fits (17Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P.

Immunocytochemistry, Fluorescence Microscopy with Structured Illumination, and Determination of Pearson Correlation Coefficients—Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells on coverslips were washed briefly with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, some were permeabilized for 10 min using 0.2% Triton X-100, and all were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 10% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. After one wash with PBS containing 1% NGS, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-HA (Sigma) or anti-Rluc (Chemicon International Inc.) mouse monoclonal antibodies were used as needed at a dilution of 1:500 in 1% NGS, PBS. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS three times and incubated with Alexa-555-tagged goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Ontario, Canada) at a dilution of 1:1500 in PBS with 1% NGS plus bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After washing three times in PBS, coverslips were rinsed in double-distilled H2O and mounted on slides using Gel Mount (Sigma). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscopy with an Apotome structured illumination module and with a ×63 oil immersion objective lens. Results reported represent a minimum of four transfections for each set of the imaging experiments described. To correlate intensities of fluorescence for each pair of proteins, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated from individual cells co-transfected with different combinations of Kv1.5 and/or HCN isoforms, tagged with GFP or Rluc. Calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient from captured images of individual cells was determined by the following equation (Axiovision User Guide), ((GVC1−MVCI)×(GVC2−MVC2)Σ(GVC1−MVC1)2×Σ(GVC2−MVC2)2 where GV represents Gray value, MV is mean value, and C is channel. The values range from -1to +1, representing an increasing correlation of the intensities measured in two channels. In other words, the Pearson correlation coefficient describes the interdependence of varying intensities of fluorescence between two proteins of interest throughout a cell. Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET2) Analysis—BRET2 experimental methods were based on a recent study examining the dimerization of G-protein-coupled receptors (32Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transiently transfected with a constant amount (0.5 μg) of Rluc-tagged and varying amounts of GFP-tagged constructs (0.5-2.0 μg) in order to measure optimal expression ratios for BRET2 experiments. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s PBS (Invitrogen), detached with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and resuspended in Dulbecco’s PBS supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Approximately 100,000 cells were then distributed into individual wells of 96-well Optiplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Using a Victor 3V plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), expression of GFP-tagged constructs was assessed by directly exciting GFP with a 400-410-nm excitation filter. Expression of Rluc-tagged constructs was assessed using luminescence values obtained in the BRET2 assay. -Fold level over background of emission was determined for both Rluc- and GFP-tagged constructs by comparing luminescence and fluorescence values with background values in untransfected cells. Although we varied the amount of cDNA of the GFP-tagged constructs, the resulting expression levels did not vary greatly, and therefore all samples were used in subsequent BRET2 experiments. For BRET2 measurements, DeepBlueC substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to cells (final concentration of 5 μm), and Rluc emission was measured through a 370-450-nm filter. Resulting GFP emission was in turn measured through a 500-530-nm filter. BRET2 ratios were calculated by the ratio of GFP emission to Rluc emission. Ratios were corrected for background by subtracting emission ratios from untransfected cells after the addition of DeepBlueC substrate. BRET2 values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. for three or six independent experiments (as noted), performed in duplicate, using different Rluc-tagged/GFP-tagged transfection ratios in each experiment. Graphing and statistical analysis were done using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting of Rat Thalamus—Rat thalami were obtained as previously described (33Ghavanini A.A. Mathers D.A. Puil E. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Tissue was processed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm each Na3VO4 and NaF, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) by multiple passes through 16-gauge and then 23-gauge syringes and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. Lysates were precleared with normal rabbit IgG and protein-A beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and then incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-HCN2 or rabbit anti-HCN4; Alomone Laboratories) and protein A beads overnight at 4 °C. For negative controls, primary antibodies were preincubated with supplied antigens for 1 h prior to incubation with precleared lysates. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold PBS and then boiled in sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min and loaded into 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blots were washed two times in TBS-T and then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T for 1 h. Blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (guinea pig anti-HCN4 (1:500) or rabbit anti-HCN2 (1:400)) (18Notomi T. Shigemoto R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 471: 241-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) in 5% nonfat milk with 3% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with TBS-T, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:3000 in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS-T, signals were obtained with ECL detection reagents (GE Healthcare). All IP experiments were carried out three times (n = 3 rats). Immunohistochemistry of Mouse Tissue Sections—Mouse day 18 embryos were obtained from CD1 mice. Isolated tissue was cryosectioned into 10-μm sections, mounted on poly-l-lysine-treated slides (Wax-it histology services; UBC), and stored at -80 °C. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed twice with PBS. Sections were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min, washed three times in PBS, and then blocked with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: guinea pig anti-HCN2 and anti-HCN4 (18Notomi T. Shigemoto R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 471: 241-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), 1:500; goat anti-HCN4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), 1:50; and rabbit anti-HCN2 (Alomone Laboratories), 1:200. For negative controls, tissue sections were incubated with either goat or guinea pig IgG or with rabbit anti-HCN2 preincubated with its supplied antigen (3:1 antigen/antibody ratio). Tissue sections were washed three times in PBS, followed by incubation with Alexa 488 or 555-tagged secondary antibodies raised in donkeys (1:1000; Molecular Probes). After three washes in PBS, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:50,000; Molecular Probes) was added to tissue for 5 min, followed by two washes in PBS. Coverslips were mounted on tissue using GelMount (Sigma), and heart tissue was visualized as described for transfected cells. These experiments were carried out on sections of heart tissue from two embryonic mice. In each field of view, four areas were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficients were determined in each area and averaged to yield one value per field of view. Values for Pearson correlation coefficients are presented as means ± S.E. in n number of fields of view. Tetrameric Assembly of HCN2 and HCN4 Isoforms—Because of their similarity to voltage-gated potassium channels, HCN channels are probably tetrameric, and their co-assembly can be described by a binomial distribution. This distribution is determined from the proportion of subunits present to the nth power (pn), where n is equal to the number of different subunit isoforms in a given channel (34Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2001; (, 3rd Ed., pp. , Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA): 427-429Google Scholar). When co-expressed, two isoforms with equal preference for homomeric and heteromeric assembly will co-assemble according to a binomial distribution, whereas any preference toward homomeric or heteromeric assembly would alter this distribution pattern. Here, we sought to determine whether HCN2 and HCN4 subunits co-assemble to form heteromeric channels and whether they exhibit a preference for homomeric versus heteromeric assembly. This was accomplished using two approaches in which HCN2 and HCN4 were tagged to Rluc or GFP epitopes. Co-transfection allowed us to obtain measurements from channels made up of a mixture of subunits possessing each tag (Fig. 1, bracketed section). Thus, both self-assembly and co-assembly could be determined independently and compared. These assays cannot measure channels made up of subunits containing the same tag or differentiate among channels that exhibit different stoichiometries, but they can report on the sum of all channels possessing both subunits. We utilized the voltage-gated channel subunit Kv1.5 as a negative control. Kv1.5 is found in the same superfamily as the HCN channel family and has a similar overall structure but is not expected to co-assemble with HCN subunits. However, when co-expressed in CHO cells, Kv1.5 is highly colocalized with both HCN2 and HCN4, as determined by measuring colocalization coefficients in the present imaging studies (see below). Thus, Kv1.5 provided a critical negative control for potential interactions among subunits that did not involve coassembly. These types of interactions include both specific interactions (e.g. between adjacent but separate tetrameric channels) and nonspecific interactions possibly due to overexpression of protein in intracellular compartments. Co-transfection of differentially tagged HCN2 and HCN4 with themselves provided positive controls for co-assembly. Homomeric and Heteromeric Combinations of HCN2 and HCN4 Produce Equally High Pearson Correlation Coefficients in CHO Cells—We first acquired immunofluorescent images of CHO cells co-expressing constructs tagged with GFP or Rluc (Fig. 2A) and determined the extents to which the intensities of their fluorescence correlated. To quantify this, we utilized a Pearson correlation coefficient (see “Experimental Procedures”). For two subunits that co-assemble to form a tetrameric ion channel, their varying levels of expression throughout a cell would be expected to be interdependent. Therefore, the variation of their intensities of fluorescence would correlate to a greater extent than for two subunits that associate in another way (e.g. two subunits that form separate channels which are localized to a similar region) or that do not associate at all. We co-transfected CHO cells with HCN2-GFP or HCN4-GFP with HCN2-Rluc, HCN4-Rluc, or Kv1.5-Rluc and correlated the intensities of fluorescence for each combination of two isoforms. A strength of this approach is that the same molecules (GFP and Rluc) were used for all correlations; thus, there is no variability in our measurements due to the use of different antibodies. We hypothesized that HCN2 or HCN4, when co-transfected with themselves or with each other, would yield Pearson correlation coefficients that were significantly higher than those produced by co-transfection of either HCN2 or HCN4 with Kv1.5, if they formed homomeric or heteromeric channels. We found that Pearson correlation coefficients were significantly larger in cells co-transfected with HCN2-GFP and HCN2-Rluc, HCN2-GFP and HCN4-Rluc, HCN4-GFP and HCN4-Rluc, or HCN4-GFP and HCN2-Rluc than those determined from cells that were co-transfected with either HCN2-GFP or HCN4-GFP and Kv1.5-Rluc (Fig. 2, B and C). Since HCN isoforms do not co-assemble with Kv1.5, the larger Pearson correlation coefficients determined for the different combinations of HCN subunits suggest co-assembly among them. This conclusi"
https://openalex.org/W2043899445,"Endocytosis is involved in the regulation of many cellular events, including signalling, cell migration, and cell polarity. To begin to investigate roles for endocytosis in early C. elegans development, we examined the distribution and dynamics of early endosomes (EEs) in embryos.EEs are primarily found at the cell periphery with an initially uniform distribution after fertilization. Strikingly, we find that during the first cell cycle, EEA-1 positive EEs become enriched at the anterior cortex. In contrast, the Golgi compartment shows no asymmetry in distribution. Asymmetric enrichment of EEs depends on acto-myosin contractility and embryonic PAR polarity. In addition to their localization at the cortex, EEs are also found around the centrosome. These EEs move rapidly (1.3 microm/s) from the cortex directly to the centrosome, a speed comparable to that of the minus end directed motor dynein.We speculate that the asymmetry of early endosomes might play a role in cell asymmetries or fate decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2016329603,"Background Intake of retinoic acid (RA) or of its precursor, vitamin A, during early pregnancy is associated with increased incidence of craniofacial lesions. The origin of these teratogenic effects remains enigmatic as in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), which largely contribute to craniofacial structures, the RA-transduction pathway is not active. Recent results suggest that RA could act on the endoderm of the first pharyngeal arch (1stPA), through a RARß-dependent mechanism. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that RA provokes dramatically different craniofacial malformations when administered at slightly different developmental times within a narrow temporal interval corresponding to the colonization of the 1st PA by CNCCs. We provide evidence showing that RA acts on the signalling epithelium of the 1st PA, gradually reducing the expression of endothelin-1 and Fgf8. These two molecular signals are instrumental in activating Dlx genes in incoming CNCCs, thereby triggering the morphogenetic programs, which specify different jaw elements. Conclusions/Significance The anatomical series induced by RA-treatments at different developmental times parallels, at least in some instances, the supposed origin of modern jaws (e.g., the fate of the incus). Our results might provide a conceptual framework for the rise of jaw morphotypes characteristic of gnathostomes."
https://openalex.org/W2013169261,"Niemann-Pick type C1 (Npc1) protein inactivation results in lipid accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes, leading to a defect of ATP binding cassette protein A1 (Abca1)-mediated lipid efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in macrophages and fibroblasts. However, the role of Npc1 in Abca1-mediated lipid efflux to apoA-I in hepatocytes, the major cells contributing to HDL formation, is still unknown. Here we show that, whereas lipid efflux to apoA-I in Npc1-null macrophages is impaired, the lipidation of endogenously synthesized apoA-I by low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol or de novo synthesized cholesterol or phospholipids in Npc1-null hepatocytes is significantly increased by about 1-, 3-, and 8-fold, respectively. The increased cholesterol efflux reflects a major increase of Abca1 protein in Npc1-null hepatocytes, which contrasts with the decrease observed in Npc1-null macrophages. The increased Abca1 expression is largely post-transcriptional, because Abca1 mRNA is only slightly increased and Lxrα mRNA is not changed, and Lxrα target genes are reduced. This differs from the regulation of Abcg1 expression, which is up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in Npc1-null cells. Abca1 protein translation rate is higher in Npc1-null hepatocytes, compared with wild type hepatocytes as measured by [35S]methionine incorporation, whereas there is no difference for the degradation of newly synthesized Abca1 in these two types of hepatocytes. Cathepsin D, which we recently identified as a positive modulator of Abca1, is markedly increased at both mRNA and protein levels by Npc1 inactivation in hepatocytes but not in macrophages. Consistent with this, inhibition of cathepsin D with pepstatin A reduced the Abca1 protein level in both Npc1-inactivated and WT hepatocytes. Therefore, Abca1 expression is specifically regulated in hepatocytes, where Npc1 activity modulates cathepsin D expression and Abca1 protein translation rate.

Here we studied the effect of Npc1 ablation on hepatocyte secretion of lipidated apoA-I and compared lipid efflux to apoA-I in Npc1-/- hepatocytes and macrophages. We show that Npc1 deficiency strikingly increases efflux and HDL formation in hepatocytes, whereas it decreases efflux in macrophages. We have explored the regulatory mechanisms involved and demonstrate a post-transcriptional up-regulation of Abca1 in hepatocytes linked to increased Ctsd expression and Abca1 translation rate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[1,2-3H]Cholesterol, [5-3H]mevalono-lactoneRs, choline [methyl-3H]chloride, and [35S]methionine were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Williams medium E, HepatoZYME-SFM, and antibiotic-antimycotic were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies directed against human apoA-I (a combination of 4H1 (against the extreme N terminus) and 5F6 (against the central region)) were described previously (23Marcel Y.L. Jewer D.

Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and protein G-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Animals and Primary Hepatocyte Cultures—Breeder Npc1+/- mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred in our animal facility. All mice were maintained on a normal chow diet in a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule and used between the ages of 6 and 8 weeks. All experiments performed were in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care Committee. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from these mice by liver collagenase perfusion according to established protocols (24Burgess J.W. Kiss R.S. Zheng H. Zachariah S. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were plated in fibronectin-precoated (25 μg/well) 6-well plates at an initial density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well in Williams medium E containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 units/ml), Fungizone (250 ng/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (25Kiss R.S.

Macrophages were generated by incubating bone marrow cells (106 cells/ml) with DMEM of 10% FBS complemented with 15% L929 conditioned medium for 7 days (27Wang M.D. Kiss R.S. Franklin V. McBride H.M.

For exogenous apoA-I-mediated efflux, cells were washed once and incubated with 1 ml/well DMEM containing 10 μg/ml human recombinant apoA-I (28Bergeron J. Frank P.G. Emmanuel F. Latta M. Zhao Y.W. Sparks D.L. Rassart E. Denefle P. Marcel Y.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For endogenous apoA-I-mediated efflux assay, 24 h after labeling, the medium was removed, and the cells in serum-free Williams medium E were infected for 1 h with either the recombinant adenovector expressing human apoA-I (Ad5-Ad AI) or as control, adeno-luciferase (Ad5-Ad Luc) at a multiplicity of infection of 75:1 plaque-forming units/cell (25Kiss R.S.

After a 1-h infection, hepatocytes were incubated for an additional 24 h with the original labeling medium, then washed and incubated for the indicated period with efflux medium as described above.Immunoprecipitation of ApoA-I-associated [3H]Cholesterol or [3H]Choline-Phospholipid—ApoA-I was immunoprecipitated either directly from the efflux medium or from lipoprotein fractions separated by fast protein liquid chromatography with a polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antiserum and pulled down with protein G-Sepharose. Control immunoprecipitations were carried out with equal volumes of an anti-human apoB antiserum from sheep, which does not cross-react with murine apoB, or with the time 0 efflux medium immunoprecipitated with anti-human apoA-I antiserum. The immunoprecipitates were collected as described previously (25Kiss R.S. McManus D.C. Franklin V. Tan W.L. McKenzie A. Chimini G. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol.

Radioactivity of cholesterol and phospholipid associated with human apoA-I was quantified by scintillation counting.Lipid Efflux in Macrophages—Unless indicated in legends, labeling conditions are as follows. Macrophages were washed three times with plain DMEM and then labeled with LDL or acetylated LDL (50 μg of protein/ml) that had been preincubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in 1% FBS of DMEM for 24 h. The cells were equilibrated with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin overnight. For labeling with [3H]mevalonate (10 μCi/ml) or [3H]choline (5 μCi/ml), the cells were incubated for 40 h in DMEM with 1% FBS. Efflux to apoA-I (10 μg in 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin medium) was monitored for 3–5 h (29Kiss R.S. Maric J. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1877-1887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Efflux to mβ-CD (10 mm in 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin DMEM) was carried out for 15 min at 37 or 4 °C (27Wang M.D. Kiss R.S. Franklin V. McBride H.M. Whitman S.C. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 633-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Lipid Analysis—Cellular lipids were extracted (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42098) Google Scholar), separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (105:45:1.5) as running solvent on Sil-G TLC plates (EMD Chemicals, Darmstadt). Lipid bands were detected by exposure to iodine vapors, scraped off the TLC plate, and radioactivity measured with a scintillation counter. For total cholesterol determination, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cholesterol was extracted by isopropyl alcohol, and measured by colorimetric assay (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA).RT-PCR—For transcription analysis in ex vivo hepatocytes or macrophages, the cells were transferred immediately after isolation into a tube with ice-cold DMEM containing 10% FBS and total RNA was isolated. In some experiments, hepatocytes also were cultured in media with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum or 10% FBS or in HepatoZYME for 2 to 5 days. Total RNA from bone marrow-derived macrophages was isolated under the efflux conditions. DNA was removed by incubation with DNase and cDNA was reverse transcribed by addition of 1 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the buffer with 2 μl of decamers, 1 μl of dNTP (25 mm), 5 μl of H2O plus 5 μl (0.5 μg) of mRNA and incubated for 1 h at 42°C. The products of 0.5 μg of target gene were amplified in a PCR tube with a specific set of primers (for one or more target genes) and one pair of internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (see supplementary materials Table S1). All primers were designed based on same annealing temperature (60 °C) and the PCR product size for each gene was preset. The PCR was run for 30 cycles. Specificity of the primers of each target gene was tested by individual PCR before mixing with internal control primers or primers of other genes. The bands of final PCR products were analyzed with Quantity One software after separation by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide.Western Blotting—Cellular proteins were solubilized in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, mixture protease inhibitors (Roche)), electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose at 125 V for 4 h. Rabbit anti-Abca1 and Abcg1 antibodies (Novus Biologicals, 1:500 dilution) were used for detection, and an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed by incubating with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The picture was taken with a mutiImage™ (AlphaInnotech, CA).Measurement of Abca1 Synthesis—Newly isolated hepatocytes were plated onto fibronectin pre-coated 60-mm Petri dishes and incubated with 10% FBS DMEM for 5 h to allow the cells to attach. Before labeling with [35S]methionine/cystine (100μCi/ml), the cells were cultured with methionine/cystine-deficient medium for 1 h to increase the labeling efficiency. After labeling with various time intervals, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS-RIPA buffer. The cell lysate was reconstituted with 4.5 ml of RIPA buffer. Total cellular Abca1 protein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-mouse Abca1 polyclonal antibody. The precipitated Abca1 was solubilized and separated by SDS-PAGE. The intact and cleaved Abca1 bands were cut and counted.Statistics—Significance was evaluated by Student’s t test.RESULTSNpc1 Deficiency Increases the Lipidation of Newly Synthesized ApoA-I in Hepatocytes—Whereas Npc1 inactivation is well known to impair intracellular cholesterol traffic and decrease cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in macrophages or fibroblasts (6Liscum L.

Here, we evaluated the effect of Npc1 inactivation on the lipidation of endogenous apoA-I in hepatocytes that were labeled with either endogenously synthesized lipids or exogenous lipids delivered by lipoproteins. Surprisingly, the lipidation of endogenously synthesized apoA-I with LDL-derived cholesterol or de novo synthesized cholesterol or de novo synthesized phospholipids was not impaired in Npc1-null hepatocytes; rather it was significantly increased by 68, 310, and 840%, respectively (Fig. 1, A–C).We also compared the effect of Npc1 inactivation on the lipidation of exogenously added apoA-I in hepatocytes and macrophages, pre-labeled with exogenously added or de novo synthesized lipids. Compared with control, exogenous apoA-I lipidation by cholesterol was significantly increased by 2.6-, 3.2-, 4.8-, and 6.0-fold in NPC1-null hepatocytes labeled with [3H]cholesterol delivered by chylomicrons, VLDL, HDL, and LDL, respectively (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the lipidation of exogenous apoA-I by newly synthesized cholesterol and phospholipids was significantly increased by 5- and 6-fold, respectively, in Npc1-null hepatocytes compared with wild type (Fig. 2B). These results contrast with those in macrophages, where the lipidation of exogenous apoA-I was reduced by 40 and 80% in Npc1-null cells labeled with LDL and acetylated LDL, respectively (Fig. 2C). As well, exogenous apoA-I lipidation by newly synthesized cholesterol or phospholipids was decreased by 30 and 55%, respectively, in Npc1-null versus wild type macrophages (Fig. 2D). These observations indicate that lipid transport and homeostasis in hepatocytes and macrophages is differentially affected by Npc1 inactivation.FIGURE 2Lipid efflux to exogenous apoA-I in hepatocytes and macrophages is differentially regulated by Npc1 inactivation. Primary hepatocytes (A and B) or bone marrow-derived macrophages (C and D) were isolated from WT or Npc1-null mice. The cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol carried by various lipoproteins (A and C) or by preincubation with [3H]mevalonate or [3H]choline to label endogenous lipids (B and D). Exogenous apoA-I lipidation in hepatocytes was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The experiments with hepatocytes were repeated three times and the data pooled. The -fold change was calculated from the ratio of efflux in Npc1-null versus WT hepatocytes (-fold change). The experiments with macrophages were also repeated 3 times and apoA-I lipidation expressed as the percent radioactivity of total cellular radioactivity associated with apoA-I and corrected for cellular protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cholesterol Traffic from Intracellular Compartments to the Plasma Membrane Is Similarly Impaired in Npc1-null Hepatocytes and Macrophages—Npc1 regulates cellular cholesterol traffic from late endosomes to other compartments, including plasma membrane and ER (1Pentchev P.G.

Similar results were obtained with hepatocytes and macrophages metabolically labeled with [3H]mevalonate (Fig. 3, B and D), where cholesterol efflux to mβ-CD at 4 °C and at 37 °C was proportionately lower. Therefore, the similar impairment of cholesterol traffic in Npc1-null hepatocytes and macrophages cannot account for the difference in cholesterol efflux between Npc1-null hepatocytes and macrophages.FIGURE 3Cholesterol traffic is similarly impaired by Npc1 inactivation in both mouse primary hepatocytes and mouse primary macrophages. Primary hepatocytes (A and B) or bone marrow-derived macrophages (C and D) were isolated from WT or Npc1-null mice.

Under basal conditions in complete medium, Abca1 protein was greatly up-regulated (3–7-fold) in Npc1-null hepatocytes compared with control (Fig. 4), and addition of LDL further increased Abca1 expression independently of Npc1 expression (data not shown). This increase in Abca1 protein was independent of the hepatocyte culture conditions and was also observed in media with 10% FBS, 5% LPDS or synthetic medium (Hepatozyme; lacking cholesterol containing serum) and in culture for 1–3 days (data not shown).

To clarify the conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis, we used protease sensitivity to monitor the conformations of the PAN ATPase from Methanococcus jannischii. Exhaustive trypsin treatment of PAN generated five distinct fragments, two of which differed when a nucleotide (either ATP, ATPγS, or ADP) was bound. Surprisingly, the nucleotide concentrations altering protease sensitivity were much lower (Ka 20-40 μm) than are required for ATP-dependent protein breakdown by the PAN-20S proteasome complex (Km ∼ 300-500 μm). Unlike trypsin, proteinase K yielded several fragments that differed in the ATPγS and ADP-bound forms, and thus revealed conformational transitions associated with ATP hydrolysis. Mapping the fragments generated by each revealed that nucleotide binding and hydrolysis induce local conformational changes, affecting the Walker A and B nucleotide-binding motif, as well as global changes extending to its carboxyl terminus. The location and overlap of the fragments also suggest that the conformation of the six subunits is not identical, probably because they do not all bind ATP simultaneously. Partial nucleotide occupancy was supported by direct assays, which demonstrated that, at saturating conditions, only four nucleotides are bound to hexameric PAN. Using the protease protection maps, we modeled the conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis in PAN based on the x-ray structures of the homologous AAA ATPase, HslU.

Using the protease protection maps, we modeled the conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis in PAN based on the x-ray structures of the homologous AAA ATPase, HslU. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, most proteins are degraded in an ATP-dependent manner (1Ciechanover A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 2Benaroudj N. Smith D. Goldberg A.L. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System. 2006; (, WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim, Germany)Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, ATP-dependent degradation is catalyzed by the 26 S proteasome, which hydrolyzes ubiquitin-conjugated and some non-ubiquitinated proteins (3Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 4Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). In this process, polyubiquitinated proteins bind the 19 S regulatory particle, which is believed to promote their unfolding and translocation into the 20 S core particle (5Kohler A. Cascio P.

The 19 S complex contains six homologous ATPases in its base, which lies adjacent to the 20 S particle. These ATPases have been implicated in substrate recognition, unfolding, translocation, and gate opening in the outer ring of the 20 S particle (5Kohler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M.

Although prokaryotes lack ubiquitin and 26 S proteasomes, archaebacteria do have 20 S proteasomes, whose architecture and proteolytic mechanism closely resemble those of the eukaryotic 20 S (11Zwickl P.

Because of its greater simplicity, the archaeal 20 S proteasome has proven very useful for structural and mechanistic studies (12Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R.

The Archaea proteasome functions in protein breakdown in association with an ATPase complex, termed PAN 3The abbreviations used are: PAN, proteasome-activating nucleotidase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino) triphosphate. 3The abbreviations used are: PAN, proteasome-activating nucleotidase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino) triphosphate. (proteasome-activating nucleotidase). When mixed with the archaeal 20 S proteasome and ATP, PAN stimulates the degradation of natively unfolded proteins and peptides longer than 7 residues, whereas shorter peptides diffuse into the 20 S proteasome unassisted (11Zwickl P. Ng D. Woo K.M. Klenk H.P. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26008-26014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PAN is a hexameric ring with a central pore, and thus its general structure resembles that of the six ATPases of the 19 S complex (6Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Like them, PAN exhibits several typical chaperone properties, including the ability to bind unfolded polypeptides selectively and to prevent their aggregation (15Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P.J.

In addition, in the presence of ATP, PAN efficiently unfolds certain globular substrates and translocates them into the 20 S proteasome (17Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PAN shows 40% homology to the six ATPases in the base of the 19 S particle and thus appears to have regulated proteasome function prior to the linkage of ubiquitination and proteolysis (11Zwickl P. Ng D. Woo K.M. Klenk H.P. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26008-26014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both proteasome-regulatory complexes are members of the AAA superfamily of multimeric ATPases, which also includes the ATP-dependent proteases Lon and FtsH and the regulatory components of the bacterial ATP-dependent proteases ClpAP, ClpXP, and HslUV (18Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 19Larsen C.N. Finley D. Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The unifying feature of the AAA superfamily is an ATPase domain of about 220 amino acids, whose structural fold has been solved by x-ray crystallography (20Lenzen C.U. Steinmann D. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R.

Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The AAA proteins show a strong sequence conservation in this domain (about 30% identity), which contains the Walker A and B (ATP binding and hydrolysis) motifs. In addition to ATP-dependent proteolysis, AAA proteins play key roles in diverse processes, from membrane trafficking to microtubule regulation (23Confalonieri F. Duguet M. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 24Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the AAA superfamily, their mode of action is not well understood. In particular, the link between the ATPase catalytic cycle and the conformational changes responsible for their biological activity remain unclear. Here, we focus on PAN, whose simplicity and uniformity offer clear advantages for understanding the role of ATP in facilitating proteolysis (9Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1339-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The degradation of a globular protein by the PAN-20S complex occurs in multiple steps (6Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar): 1) ATPase association with the 20 S particle; 2) opening of the substrate entry channel in the 20 S proteasome; 3) binding of the substrate to the ATPase; 4) global unfolding of the substrate on the ATPase surface; and 5) processive translocation of the unfolded substrate into the 20 S particle. These functions must be mediated by specific conformational transitions in the ATPase complex upon ATP binding, hydrolysis to ADP, or exchange of ADP for ATP, and a full understanding of ATP-dependent proteolysis will require the resolution of the structural changes associated with each step. Whereas subunit interactions of 19 S subunits have been mapped by cross-linking, mutational analysis, or yeast two-hybrid approaches, nothing is known of how ATP binding and hydrolysis affects the structure of the eukaryotic 19 S particle or the homologous PAN ATPase complex (25Davy A.

To investigate the influence of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis on the conformation of PAN, we monitored its susceptibility to different proteases in the absence or presence of ATP, ATPγS (a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog), or ADP, and mapped the protease-resistant domains by Edman degradation. Further studies of the sensitivity of PAN to proteinase K uncovered distinct conformations corresponding to the ATPγS-bound and ADP-bound forms, indicating conformational transitions coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Using the solved structures of a homologous AAA family member, we were able to model the main parts of the PAN molecule and the kinds of conformational changes induced by nucleotides. Protein Purification—Untagged PAN and mutants were purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli transformed with pRSET plasmid, as previously described (9Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1339-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis indicates that these preparations do not contain monomeric PAN. 4D. M. Smith and A. L. Goldberg, unpublished observation. Additionally, these preparations bind the 20 S proteasome stoichiometrically (6Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Protease Protection—2 μg of PAN (275 nm) was diluted in the digest buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, with or without 2 mm ATP, ADP, or ATPγS) and preincubated 10 min at 20 °C. Protease was added at 30 μg/ml (1.25 μm) Calbiochem trypsin) or 600 ng/ml (207 nm) (Novagen proteinase K) and samples were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min. Digested samples were immediately run on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. YFP Degradation Assay—YFP-ssrA was used as a substrate for degradation by PAN and 20 S proteasome, as previously described (9Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1339-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Peptide Mapping—Following digestion and SDS-PAGE, protein samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Ponceau, and excised for Edman degradation at the Dana-Farber core sequencing facility. Kinetics—PAN was digested as described, with 0-2 mm ATP, ADP, or ATPγS. Gels were scanned, and band density was determined with Scanalytics One-Dscan 2.03 software. These data were graphed and Michaelis-Menten kinetics were determined. Nucleotide Binding Assay—35S-Labeled ATPγS bound to PAN was separated from free nucleotide using a rapid spin column technique as described (30Menon A.S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14921-14928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various concentrations of PAN were incubated at 37 °C with a minimal 10-fold higher concentration of ATPγ35S (10 mCi/ml, 1200 Ci/mmol, from Amersham Biosciences). Recovery of PAN from the column was 95% as determined by Bradford protein assay and activity assay. The concentration of bound nucleotide was determined by comparing the total counts of the control 1 mm ATPγ35S solution with the number of counts bound to PAN. To identify the conformational transitions in PAN that result from nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, five different proteolytic enzymes were initially tested: trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, V8, and proteinase K (data not shown). Of these, trypsin digestion of PAN for 20 min at 20 °C proved to be the most informative and reproducible. This digest yielded 5 distinct fragments of the following sizes: 43.5 (Tryp 1), 30.3 (Tryp 2), 14 (Tryp 4), 12 (Tryp 5), and 10.6 kDa (Tryp 6) (Fig. 1A, lane 2), which resisted further digestion when increasing amounts of trypsin (from 30 to 60 μg/ml) were added (data not shown). Tryp 1 was always present, although its amount varied some-what between assays. We attempted to study the generation of these fragments further by conducting time courses of PAN digestion with trypsin. Unfortunately, we were unable to control the reaction sufficiently to study digestion intermediates. Consequently, we have focused in this study on the protease-resistant domains produced by prolonged incubation with trypsin. To test the effects of nucleotides on trypsin sensitivity, we determined whether the digestion products differed after pre-incubation of PAN with ATP, ADP, or ATPγS. Each of these nucleotides altered the pattern of fragments produced, and, surprisingly, they caused an almost identical set of changes. The pattern of fragments in the presence or absence of a nucleotide differed in two ways. With the addition of each nucleotide, a new product of 25.5 kDa (Tryp 3) appeared, and the smallest peptide (Tryp 6) disappeared (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-5). These nucleotide-induced alterations reflect changes in the accessibility of trypsin sites and thus indicate conformational changes in PAN. To define the affinity of the binding site responsible for the changes in susceptibility to trypsin, we incubated PAN with increasing concentrations of ATP, ADP, or ATPγS, followed by exhaustive digestion with trypsin and analysis by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie-stained gels were scanned, and the Tryp 3 band, which was produced specifically in the presence of nucleotides, was quantified by densitometery (representative data with ATP is shown in Fig. 1B). When the amounts of this band were plotted against nucleotide concentration, in each case a clear saturation curve was obtained that could be fitted accurately with a model assuming saturable binding of the nucleotide to inhibit cleavage by trypsin. The concentrations of these nucleotides that gave half-maximal production of Tryp 3 were very similar: Ka for ATP = 40 μm, ADP = 27 μm, ATPγS = 22 μm. These changes in sensitivity were due to nucleotide binding to PAN, and not to some effect on trypsin activity, because in control experiments, increasing concentrations of ATP caused no change in the rate of casein hydrolysis by trypsin or the nature of the products generated (data not shown). Surprisingly, the Ka of PAN for these nucleotides (∼20-40 μm) was much lower than the Km previously determined for the ATP-dependent breakdown of casein by the PAN-20S complex (∼500 μm) (31Wilson H.L. Ou M.S. Aldrich H.C. Maupin-Furlow J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1680-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or at 300 μm. 5N. Ng and A. L. Goldberg, unpublished observations. To confirm that the high affinity binding of nucleotides to PAN is dependent on the Walker A and Walker B motifs (amino acids 211-273), we engineered two variants of PAN (32Hartman J.J. Vale R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 34Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). First, we substituted an arginine for the conserved lysine (K217R) in the Walker A domain, which in other ATPases is necessary for nucleotide binding. The pattern of peptides generated upon incubation of this Walker A mutant with trypsin was minimally affected by the presence of any of the nucleotides (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4). Although Tryp 3 was generated at low efficiency in the presence of a nucleotide, this may indicate that a small degree of nucleotide binding occurs in the K217R mutant. We also inserted a glutamine for the glutamic acid (E271Q) in the Walker B motif, which is required for ATP hydrolysis in other ATPases. The Walker B mutant in PAN exhibited the same changes in trypsin sensitivity upon addition of ATP, ADP, or ATPγS as the unmodified PAN (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8). Therefore, the conformational changes detected by the trypsin protection assay require nucleotide binding at the Walker A motif, but not ATP hydrolysis, as was also suggested by the identical products obtained with ADP and ATPγS. To confirm that these mutations were affecting the capacity of PAN to support ATP-dependent protein degradation by the 20 S particle, we assayed the degradation of an YFP-ssrA fusion protein (Fig. 2B). Unmodified PAN catalyzed the ATP-dependent degradation of YFP-ssrA by the 20 S, as shown by the reduction in green fluorescence protein fluorescence. However, neither the Walker A nor Walker B mutants showed any activity. Thus, both conformational changes detected by trypsin and ATP-dependent proteolysis require the same ATP-binding site, even though these events occur at different concentrations of the nucleotide. To define the protease-resistant domains and localize the conformational changes in PAN upon nucleotide binding, we used Edman degradation to map the stable products generated by trypsin. A unique amino-terminal sequence was found for each fragment (Fig. 3A). Only a small fraction of the arginine or lysine residues in PAN were cleaved by trypsin, and all the fragments that were resistant to trypsin contained an additional potential cleavage sites that presumably were protected by the structure of the domain. The Tryp 1 (395 amino acids) and Tryp 2 (275 amino acids) fragments, observed in the presence or absence of a nucleotide, lack the NH2-terminal 35 and 155 amino acids, respectively. The first 35 residues, which are largely charged, were not recovered in any fragment, and likely correspond to a trypsin-sensitive region with a loose structure. Tryp 3, a COOH-terminal fragment of 232 amino acids was observed only in the presence of nucleotides. The nearly identical Tryp 4 (127 amino acids) and Tryp 5 (109 amino acids) were observed regardless of nucleotide, and are located near the NH2 terminus of Tryp 1. The second nucleotide-sensitive fragment, COOH-terminal Tryp 6 (96 amino acids), disappeared in the presence of nucleotide. The location of the nucleotide-sensitive fragments Tryp 3 and Tryp 6 suggests that nucleotide-induced conformational changes occur both locally (around the Walker A and B domains) and globally (throughout the protein). The NH2 terminus of Tryp 3 is located in the vicinity of the Walker A and B motif and thus its generation could be directly affected by local structural changes accompanying nucleotide binding. Tryp 6, however, is over 60 amino acids away from the COOH-terminal end of the Walker A and B motif and 136 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of Tryp 3. Its disappearance after binding of a nucleotide requires an alteration in the carboxyl-terminal region of the PAN monomers. Although it is possible that Arg334 (Tryp 6 cleavage site) is actually adjacent to the Walker motifs in the three-dimensional structure, this cleavage indicates that nucleotide binding has global effects on the structure of PAN. Overlapping Trypsin Fragments Support the Existence of Multiple Monomer Conformations—Although Tryp 3 and Tryp 6 overlap in sequence with the nucleotide-insensitive Tryp 2, the generation of Tryp 3 in the presence of a nucleotide cannot occur via further processing of Tryp 2. As shown in Fig. 1B, the addition of nucleotides generated increasing amounts of Tryp 3 without affecting the amount of Tryp 2. By contrast, Tryp 3 and Tryp 6 seem to be generated by alternative processing of a common precursor, because the accumulation of Tryp 3 correlated directly with the disappearance of Tryp 6. It follows that Tryp 3 and Tryp 6 must be generated from different monomers than those that generate Tryp 2. To further analyze the relationship between the nucleotide-sensitive Tryp 3 and Tryp 6, we determined the quantity of each fragment in Fig. 1B by densitometry, and plotted the percent of maximum fragment generated against the concentration of ATP in the reaction (Fig. 3B). The intersection of these plots occurs near the 50% maximum of each of the fragments, supporting the notion that fragments 3 and 6 are generated from the same full-length monomer (i.e. at the expense of each other). Furthermore, the concentration at which this intersection occurs is similar to the Ka of PAN for nucleotide (∼40 μm ATPγS). All Six PAN Subunits Do Not Bind ATPγS Simultaneously—These results strongly suggest that although PAN is a homohexamer, individual subunits can adopt alternate conformations. The simplest mechanism by which heterogeneity in the homohexameric ring might arise would be if some subunits bound nucleotides, whereas others did not. To directly test this hypothesis, we measured nucleotide binding to PAN using radiolabeled ATPγS and Sephadex G-50 spin columns to separate PAN from the unbound nucleotide. With increasing amounts of PAN, increasing amounts of ATPγ35S were recovered with PAN in the flow-through. As shown in Fig. 4, the slope of this line indicated binding of exactly four nucleotides per PAN hexamer. These results were obtained at a high concentration of ATPγS (1mm) that gave maximal binding (data not shown). Thus, these experiments indicate that each PAN hexamer binds a maximum of four ATPγS molecules under saturating conditions (Fig. 4) and support the existence of multiple monomer conformations as suggested by the trypsin fragments (Fig. 4). Protease Treatment Distinguishes ATPγS- and ADP-bound Forms of PAN—Because the ATPγS- and ADP-bound state of PAN are known to have different functional consequences (6Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Benaroudj N. Zwickl P. Seemuller E. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but did not differ in susceptibility to trypsin, the changes associated with ATP hydrolysis must not expose or conceal a trypsin-sensitive site. We therefore tested other proteases to see if there were any differences in the products generated upon binding of ATPγS and ADP. As shown in Fig. 5A, the fragments generated by proteinase K in the presence of ADP (or without a nucleotide, data not shown) differed from those produced with ATPγS. As determined by Edman degradation, the first 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of PAN were lost after proteinase K treatment, which is further evidence that this NH2-terminal region is relatively unstructured (Fig. 5B). Unfortunately, the fragments generated with proteinase K (in contrast to those with trypsin) were not completely resistant to the protease, and as a result varied in quantity between experiments, and therefore could not be quantitated reliably. A complete description of the fragments is included in the figure legend. The cleavage patterns clearly indicate that two types of conformational changes were induced by ATPγS. One involved a decrease in the quantity of Prok 3 (which was not found with ATPγS), whereas there was an increase in Prok 5 (which was predominant with ATPγS). The other resulted in the loss of Prok 4 (which was not found with ATPγS) and the appearance of Prok 6 (which was unique to ATPγS). As found with trypsin, the changes monitored with proteinase K digestion involved the complete protein, including the ATP-binding domain. The conformational change leading to the generation of Prok 5 occurs in the Walker A and B regions and therefore can be attributed to local structural changes associated with the loss of the γ-phosphate. By contrast, the generation of Prok 6 suggests a global conformational change, which extends to the very carboxyl terminus of the molecule. These two results indicate a cycle of conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis to ADP. In this study, digestions with trypsin and proteinase K have provided complementary information about the structure of PAN and the effects of nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis. The trypsin digest is particularly interesting because it indicates that there are multiple monomer conformations in the homohexameric ring. The overlap between fragments Tryp 3 and 6 (Fig. 3B) could result from three distinct conformations of the monomer. We propose that the first conformation, “A,” yields Tryp 2 upon digestion and is observed in the presence or absence of a nucleotide. In the absence of a nucleotide, a second conformation, “B”, yields Tryp 6. Upon addition of nucleotide, the B conformation converts to a third form, “C,” which yields Tryp 3. The existence of multiple conformations in a complex is due most likely to nucleotide binding to only some of six subunits of PAN. Partial occupancy of the hexamer by nucleotides was directly confirmed by a nucleotide binding measurement, which indicated that only four ATPγS molecules bound per PAN hexamer at sat"

Cholesterol was long thought to be the cellular receptor for these toxins, but not all CDCs require cholesterol for binding. Intermedilysin, secreted by Streptococcus intermedius, only binds to membranes containing the human protein CD59 but forms pores only if the membrane contains sufficient cholesterol. In contrast, perfringolysin O (PFO), secreted by Clostridium perfringens, only binds to membranes containing substantial amounts of cholesterol. Given that different steps in the assembly of various CDC pores require cholesterol, here we have analyzed to what extent cholesterol molecules, by themselves, can modulate the conformational changes associated with PFO oligomerization and pore formation. PFO binds to cholesterol when dispersed in aqueous solution, and this binding triggers the distant rearrangement of a β-strand that exposes an oligomerization interface. Moreover, upon binding to cholesterol, PFO forms a prepore complex, unfolds two amphipathic transmembrane β-hairpins, and positions their nonpolar surfaces so they associate with the hydrophobic cholesterol surface. The interaction of PFO with cholesterol is therefore sufficient to initiate an irreversible sequence of coupled conformational changes that extend throughout the toxin molecule.

It is therefore not surprising that some bacterial poreforming toxins have evolved to take advantage of this property of mammalian cells. For example, the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) 2The abbreviations used are: CDC, cholesterol-dependent cytolysin; PFO, perfringolysin O; ILY, intermedilysin; CMC, critical micellar concentration; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; BDF, N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)methyl iodoacetamide; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodide; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; FRET, Foörster resonance energy transfer; TMH, transmembrane β-hairpin. secreted by a number of Gram-positive bacteria absolutely require cholesterol in the target membrane to create a pore (1Alouf J.E.

Immunol. 2001; 257: 15-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Palmer M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 238: 281-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The abundance of CDCs reveals their importance in the pathogenic mechanisms of these organisms (2Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 15-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absolute requirement for cholesterol led researchers to postulate that cholesterol functioned as a receptor for CDC molecules. Consistent with this view, preincubation of CDCs with cholesterol inhibited their binding to membranes when exposed to mammalian cells (1Alouf J.E. Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. 1991Google Scholar). However, this long standing paradigm has recently been challenged by the finding that not all CDCs require cholesterol for membrane binding. The CDC from Streptococcus intermedius, intermedilysin (ILY), binds to a membrane protein receptor, the human CD59 (4Giddings K.S. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Yet ILY forms pores only if the membrane contains substantial cholesterol (5Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of membrane cholesterol to the mechanism of CDC cytolysis appears to be more complicated and multifaceted than simply acting as a CDC-binding site. Perfringolysin O (PFO), secreted by pathogenic Clostridium perfringens (2Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 15-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a prototypical CDC. Upon encountering a cholesterol-containing membrane, the toxin oligomerizes and spontaneously inserts into the bilayer to form a large transmembrane pore (diameter ∼300 Å) (6Mitsui K. Sekiya T.

Pore formation occurs when two amphipathic β-hairpins from each PFO molecule are inserted to span the membrane (16Shatursky O. Heuck A.P. Shepard L.A. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K.

The concerted insertion of transmembrane β-hairpins (TMHs) from ∼35 PFO monomers then creates a large transmembrane β-barrel (8Dang T.X. Hotze E.M. Rouiller I. Tweten R.K. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made in characterizing the structural changes in PFO that occur at different stages of pore formation, the mechanism by which cholesterol promotes PFO binding to the membrane and ultimately pore formation remains unknown. PFO binds only to liposomal and cellular membranes that contain more than 30 mol % cholesterol (10Heuck A.P. Hotze E.M. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Ohno-Iwashita Y. Iwamoto M. Ando S. Iwashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that PFO binds to cholesterol-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts (20Ohno-Iwashita Y. Shimada Y. Waheed A. Hayashi M. Inomata M. Nakamura M. Maruya M. Iwashita M. Anaerobe. 2004; 10: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the different phases detected in cholesterol:phospholipid mixtures are already present in membranes at cholesterol concentrations lower than 30 mol % of total lipids (21Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8686-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 22Miao L. Nielsen M. Thewalt J. Ipsen J.H. Bloom M. Zuckermann M.J. Mouritsen O.G.

Lipids. 2004; 39: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). It is therefore difficult to envision why PFO binding to a membrane exhibits such a sharp dependence on bilayer cholesterol content (10Heuck A.P. Hotze E.M. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Heuck A.P. Johnson A.E. Protein-Lipid Interactions. From Membrane Domains to Cellular Networks. 2005; (Tamm, L. K., ed) pp. , Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany: 163-186Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that PFO binding to membranes is dictated by the cholesterol chemical potential rather by the formation of a particular phospholipid(s)-cholesterol phase or raft. Consistent with this possibility, a sharp increase in the chemical potential of cholesterol has been observed when the cholesterol concentration is raised above 30 mol % of the total lipids (25Huang J. Feigenson G.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2142-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 26McConnell H.M. Radhakrishnan A. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, whereas arc and ring structures similar to those observed in natural membranes are formed when PFO is incubated with cholesterol dispersions, the lytic, lethal, and cardiotoxic properties of PFO and related toxins are inhibited by exposure to pure cholesterol (1Alouf J.E. Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. 1991Google Scholar, 28Vazquez-Boland J.A. Dominguez L. Rodriguez-Ferri E.F. Suarez G. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3928-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Harris J.R. Adrian M. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of cholesterol in PFO cytolysis, we decided to determine the extent to which different steps in the cytolytic pathway could be elicited solely by the presence of cholesterol. Site-directed fluorescence labeling, stage-specific PFO derivatives, and several different fluorescence spectroscopic techniques were used to examine cholesterol-dependent changes in PFO conformation. Our studies reveal that a selective interaction between the loops at the tip of PFO D4 with cholesterol initiates coupled conformational changes that extend throughout the toxin molecule. These conformational changes are indistinguishable from those shown to occur when PFO binds to, oligomerizes on, and forms pores in liposomal and cellular membranes containing sufficient cholesterol. Furthermore, once initiated, these allosteric conformational changes are not reversible. Preparation of PFO Derivatives—A construct containing the wild-type PFO sequence was obtained by PCR-based mutagenesis using the QuickChange (Stratagene) procedure and the pRSETB plasmid coding for the rPFO (11Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827Google Scholar). The codon GCT for Ala-459 was replaced by the codon TGC for Cys-459. The derivative containing the native undecapeptide sequence (residues 458–468) is referred as nPFO. PFOC459A is designated rPFO, and its derivatives were expressed and purified as described previously (11Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827Google Scholar, 12Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Shatursky O. Heuck A.P.

Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7139-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Labeling of rPFO Derivatives—rPFO derivatives were labeled with NBD as before (17Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Briefly, rPFO derivatives (5–10 μm) in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) were reacted for 2 h at room temperature (∼22 °C) with a 10-fold molar excess of N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) ethylene-diamine. In the case of rPFOV322C, the reaction was made 3 m in guanidine hydrochloride to facilitate access of the N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) ethylenediamine to the partially buried Cys (12Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). NBD-labeled rPFO derivatives were separated from free dye by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column (1.5 cm inner diameter × 25 cm) equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl). The efficiency of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically to be 80–100% by using molar absorptivity coefficients of 74,260 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm and 25,000 m-1 cm-1 at 478 nm for rPFO and NBD, respectively (31Pace C.N.

The Handbook: A Guide to Fluorescent Probes and Labeling Technologies. 2005; (Spence, M. T. Z.), 10th Ed., pp. , Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA: 93-109Google Scholar). For Foörster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)methyl iodoacetamide (BDF) and tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodide (TMR) labeling of rPFO derivatives was also done using a 10-fold molar excess of the thiol-specific fluorescent reagent. The efficiencies of labeling were determined spectrophotometrically to be greater than 70% by using a molar absorptivity coefficient of 76,000 m-1 cm-1 at 502 nm for BDF and 87,000 m-1 cm-1 at 543 nm for TMR (32Haugland R.P. The Handbook: A Guide to Fluorescent Probes and Labeling Technologies. 2005; (Spence, M. T. Z.), 10th Ed., pp. , Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA: 93-109Google Scholar). All fluorescent probes were obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). All fluorophore-labeled rPFO derivatives were frozen in small aliquots in Buffer B containing 10% (v/v) in glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Liposomes—Synthetic liposomal membranes were composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and the indicated sterol and were generated as described previously (15Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31218-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cholesterol (5-cholesten-3β-ol) and 3-epicholesterol (5-cholesten-3α-ol) were obtained from Steraloids. Incubation with Sterol Dispersions in Aqueous Solutions—Water-soluble PFO monomer samples (0.3 ml final volume, 0.1 μm final concentration) in buffer C (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were equilibrated at 37 °C for 5 min before the net initial emission intensity (F0) was determined (i.e. after blank subtraction). Sterols were then added to the indicated final concentration, and the sample was then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The net emission intensity (F) of the sample was determined after blank subtraction and dilution correction. Sterols were dissolved in absolute ethanol to 10 mm and diluted with additional ethanol as necessary. When added to solutions of nPFO or rPFO derivatives, the final concentration of ethanol was always lower than 5% (v/v). Control samples were incubated with an identical volume of ethanol. When indicated, sterol aggregates were dissolved by the addition of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD, Sigma) to a final concentration of 3 mm. Assay for Pore Formation—The pore formation activity of PFO and their derivatives was assayed as described before (15Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31218-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Steady-state Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intensity measurements were performed using the same instrumentation described earlier (17Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength and bandpass and the emission wavelength and bandpass were, respectively, 470, 4, 530, and 4 nm for NBD; 295, 2, 348, and 4 nm for Trp; 470, 2, 510, and 2 nm for BDF/TMR FRET determinations; 500, 1, 500, 1 nm for right angle light scattering measurements and 278, 2, 544, 4 nm for Tb(DPA)33−. For Tb(DPA)33− measurements, an Oriel 5215 cutoff filter (0% transmittance below 350 nm) was placed in the emission light path to block any second-order excitation light. Kinetics measurements and end point measurements were done as described earlier (15Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31218-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Coating of the cuvettes with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine vesicles was omitted for all experiments containing only sterols. Energy Transfer Measurements—Four biochemically equivalent samples were prepared in parallel for each energy transfer measurement: sample D (donor only) contained 50 nm rPFOE167C-BDF and 50 nm of unlabeled rPFOE167C; sample DA (donor + acceptor) contained 50 nm rPFOE167C-BDF and 50 nm rPFOE167C-TMR; sample A (acceptor only) contained 50 nm rPFOE167C and 50 nm rPFOE167C-TMR; and sample B (blank) contained 100 nm rPFOE167C. In all four samples, the final cholesterol concentration was 3 μm. All samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in Buffer C to permit complete binding of rPFO derivatives to cholesterol before spectral measurements were initiated. Electron Microscopy—nPFO (10 nm) was incubated with 3 μm cholesterol in standard Buffer C for 30 min at room temperature (20–23 °C) after which 5 μl of sample were applied onto a Formvar carbon-coated copper grid that had been rendered hydrophilic by glow-discharging for 25 s. After 60 s, excess solution was blotted, and samples were stained with 1% (w/v) ammonium molybdate (pH 7.0). Specimens were observed in a JEOL 1200-EX transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Micrographs were recorded at a calibrated magnification. PFO Binds Selectively to Cholesterol Dispersed in Aqueous Solution—CDCs bind to membranes via D4, and this interaction typically involves the exposure of Trp residues located at the tip of D4 to the nonpolar core of cholesterol-containing membranes (9Nakamura M. Sekino N. Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6513-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Heuck A.P. Hotze E.M. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol.

Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7139-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because this decrease in polarity increases the intrinsic Trp emission intensity of the PFO molecule, this spectral change directly detects PFO binding to the membrane surface (9Nakamura M. Sekino N. Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6513-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Heuck A.P. Hotze E.M. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether Trp emission intensity changes could be used to detect direct interactions between cholesterol and nPFO. Upon addition to an aqueous solution, cholesterol undergoes a reversible self-association at the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of ∼35 nm at 25 °C to form colloidal aggregates (33Haberland M.E. Reynolds J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2313-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Such cholesterol aggregates are rod-shaped and heterogeneous in size (34Castanho M.A. Brown W. Prieto M.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The maximum solubility for cholesterol in aqueous solutions is ∼5 μm. Above this concentration, crystal formation leads to cholesterol precipitation (33Haberland M.E. Reynolds J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2313-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The appearance of such cholesterol precipitate is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the amount of 500 nm light scattered by the solution (Fig. 1C). When nPFO was titrated with cholesterol dispersed in aqueous solution, no change in Trp intensity was detected when the concentration of cholesterol was below the CMC (Fig. 1C). However, when the concentration of cholesterol was raised above the CMC, a concentration-dependent increase in Trp emission was observed. The binding isotherm for 0.1 μm of nPFO at different cholesterol concentrations showed that complete binding was achieved only when the cholesterol concentration was ≥3 μm, corresponding to a toxin:cholesterol ratio of at least 1:30. Because the maximum increase in Trp intensity was the same with cholesterol aggregates as with cholesterol-containing membranes, these results suggest that the Trp environments are nearly equivalent when nPFO is bound to cholesterol-containing membranes and to colloidal aggregates containing only cholesterol. Importantly, no spectral change was observed when nPFO was titrated with 3-epicholesterol, an isomer that differs from cholesterol only in that the hydroxyl group is directed axially instead of equatorially (Fig. 1). We therefore concluded that the cholesterol-dependent Trp emission intensity change was not the product of a nonspecific interaction between D4 and a non-polar surface. Instead, the fluorescence change resulted from a selective interaction between the hydrophobic amino acids located in the D4 loops and the cholesterol molecules. From these data, it is clear that PFO D4 can interact with cholesterol aggregates in solution. However, because D4 contains six Trp residues, it is difficult to identify unambiguously which D4 residues are exposed to cholesterol using Trp fluorescence. Which Parts of D4 Interact with Cholesterol?—To identify D4 sites that contact purified cholesterol, the emission intensities of four different NBD-labeled rPFO mutants were examined before and after incubation with cholesterol. In this approach, a single amino acid in a Cys-free protein is replaced with a Cys residue, and its sulfhydryl group is covalently modified with the water-sensitive fluorophore NBD (35Heuck A.P. Johnson A.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we examined four derivatives whose interactions with cholesterol-containing membranes had been characterized earlier by us (Fig. 2A) (11Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827Google Scholar). Probes attached at residues 491 and 437 to yield rPFOL491C-NBD and rPFOA437C-NBD were used to ascertain whether the tip of D4 interacted with cholesterol, whereas two other derivatives, rPFOV442C-NBD and rPFOK455C-NBD, were used to assess the exposure of the external surfaces of the D4 β-sandwich to cholesterol in solution. The function of these proteins was not compromised by mutagenesis and modification (11Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827Google Scholar). Because NBD movement from an aqueous milieu to a more hydrophobic environment, such as the nonpolar core of a membrane bilayer, is accompanied by a pronounced increase in NBD emission intensity and lifetime (35Heuck A.P. Johnson A.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Johnson A.E. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1078-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the spectral properties of these derivatives were monitored before and after incubation with cholesterol dispersed in aqueous buffer. We observed that the emission intensities of probes located at position 437 and 491, each located in a loop at the tip of D4, increased 12- and 30-fold, respectively, after incubation with 3 μm cholesterol in aqueous buffer. No increase in either NBD or Trp fluorescence was observed when only ethanol lacking cholesterol was added to the buffer solution containing these rPFO derivatives. Thus, exposure to cholesterol caused these probes to move from an aqueous milieu into a hydrophobic environment. In contrast, the emission intensities of probes located at positions 442 and 455 did not change significantly (Fig. 2B). Hence, the latter two probes were in an aqueous milieu before and after cholesterol addition. MβCD has been used extensively to manipulate the cholesterol content in cellular membranes (5Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MβCDs are able to bind cholesterol molecules and dissolve cholesterol aggregates in aqueous solution, as detected by the reduction in light scattered by the dispersed cholesterol molecules (data not shown). Interestingly, when MβCD was added to a sample containing both rPFO and cholesterol, the cholesterol-dependent emission intensity increases were reversed for the NBD dyes at the tip of D4 (Fig. 2, 437 and 491). Cholesterol-dependent Changes in PFO Domain 3—The interaction of PFO with cholesterol-containing membranes triggers conformational changes in the molecule that regulates the oligomerization of the toxin on the membrane surface. Upon membrane binding, a short β-strand (β5) located in domain 3 (D3) moves to expose the edge of a previously hidden β-strand (β4) that forms the monomer-monomer interface and is required for oligomer assembly (Fig. 3A) (12Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This conformational change can be followed by the exposure of an NBD dye covalently attached to a single Cys substituted at position 322 in rPFO, rPFOV322C-NBD. In the water-soluble monomer, the NBD dye at position 322 exhibited a high fluorescence lifetime (τ ∼ 8 ns), but this lifetime drops considerably (τ ∼ 1 ns) upon pore formation. This conformational change can also be followed by the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the NBD dye, which occurs at the same rate as the D4 Trp emission intensity increase upon membrane binding (12Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of D4 with cholesterol aggregates is sufficient to trigger the conformational change in D3, rPFOV322C-NBD was incubated with different amounts of cholesterol, and the fluorescence intensities of the 322-NBD and Trp residues followed in parallel in the same sample. The extent of the D4 Trp intensity increases paralleled the extent of the 322-NBD intensity decreases in D3 (Fig. 3B). Thus, a D4 interaction with pure cholesterol is sufficient to trigger a conformational change in D3 that exposes the NBD dye to the aqueous solvent. This interaction is cholesterol-selective, because addition of 3-epicholesterol to rPFOV322C-NBD did not significantly affect either Trp emission or NBD emission (Fig. 3C). Having noted that the cholesterol-dependent increase in NBD-labeled D4 emission was reversed by the addition of MβCD, we determined whether the cholesterol-induced"
https://openalex.org/W2010017695,"Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-Microscopy) allows the observation of individual secretory vesicles in real-time during exocytosis. In contrast to electrophysiological methods, such as membrane capacitance recording or carbon fiber amperometry, TIRF-Microscopy also enables the observation of vesicles as they reside close to the plasma membrane prior to fusion. However, TIRF-Microscopy is limited to the visualization of vesicles that are located near the membrane attached to the glass coverslip on which the cell grows. This has raised concerns as to whether exocytosis measured with TIRF-Microscopy is comparable to global secretion of the cell measured with membrane capacitance recording. Here we address this concern by combining TIRF-Microscopy and membrane capacitance recording to quantify exocytosis from adrenal chromaffin cells. We found that secretion measured with TIRF-Microscopy is representative of the overall secretion of the cells, thereby validating for the first time the TIRF method as a measure of secretion. Furthermore, the combination of these two techniques provides a new tool for investigating the molecular mechanism of synaptic transmission with combined electrophysiological and imaging techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2005329916,"Twenty-six point mutations were introduced into the N-terminal and middle parts of transmembrane segment M1 of the Na+,K+-ATPase and its cytosolic extension. None of the alterations to charged and polar residues in the N-terminal part of M1 and its cytosolic extension had any major effect on the cation binding properties, thus rejecting the hypothesis that these residues are involved in cation selectivity. By contrast, specific residues in the middle part of M1, particularly Leu99, were found critical to K+ interaction of the enzyme. Hence, mutation L99A reduced the affinity for K+ activation of E2P dephosphorylation 17-fold, and L99F reduced the equilibrium level of the K+-occluded intermediate [K2]E2 and increased the rate of K+ deocclusion 39-fold, i.e. more than seen for mutation E329Q of the cation-binding glutamate in M4. L99Q affected K+ interaction in yet another way, the equilibrium level of [K2]E2 being slightly increased despite an increased rate of K+ deocclusion, suggesting that the K+ ions leave and enter the occlusion pocket more frequently than in the wild type. L99Q furthermore affected the ability to discriminate between Na+ and K+ on the extracellular side. Our findings can be explained by a structural model in which Leu99 and Glu329 interact and cooperate in K+ binding and gating of the K+ sites. The disturbance of K+ interaction in mutants with alteration to Leu91, Phe95, Ser96, or Leu98 could be a consequence of the roles of these residues in positioning the M1 helix optimally for the interaction between Leu99 and Glu329.

The Na+,K+-ATPase 2The abbreviations used are: Na+,K+-ATPase, Na+- and K+-transporting adenosine triphosphatase; M1–M10, transmembrane segments numbered from the N terminus; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (EC 3.6.3.9), located in the plasma membrane, is an ATP-driven ion pump that transports three Na+ out of the cell in exchange for two K+ being transported into the cell for each ATP hydrolyzed, thereby creating the gradients for Na+ and K+ essential to cellular function (1Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is a member of the superfamily of P-type ATPases, which in addition includes H+,K+-ATPases, H+-ATPases, Ca2+-ATPases, as well as heavy metal ion-transporting ATPases. The distinguishing biochemical feature of P-type ATPases is the formation during their reaction cycle of a covalent acylphosphate enzyme intermediate, resulting from the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to a conserved aspartyl residue within the protein. Scheme 1 depicts the reaction cycle of the Na+,K+-ATPase that describes how ion movement is linked with ATP hydrolysis through conformational changes in the enzyme (1Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J.

The translocation of Na+ across the membrane during the E1P → E2P transition and the translocation of K+ during the E2 → E1 transition involve so-called “occluded” states (indicated in Scheme 1 by brackets), where the intramembranously bound ions are inaccessible to the medium on either side of the membrane, their dissociation being prevented by “gates” (1Post R.L.

The main polypeptide chain of the Na+,K+-ATPase is composed of two major parts as follows: a transmembrane part consisting of 10 transmembrane α-helices (M1–M10) (6Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

No high resolution structure is yet available for the Na+,K+-ATPase, but the structure of the closely related Ca2+-ATPase has been determined at atomic resolution for several conformational states (8Toyoshima C.

Structural comparison of these atomic models has revealed major rearrangements both in the cytoplasmic and the membranous parts of the molecule. In connection with the formation of the Ca2+-occluded intermediate, the helical structure of M1 bends (at Asp59), and the M1–M2 hairpin is shifted in the direction perpendicular to the membrane toward the cytoplasmic side. Glu309 in transmembrane segment M4 (the residue homologous to Glu329 in the Na+,K+-ATPase) seems to work as a cytoplasmic gate of the Ca2+ binding pocket by changing its side chain conformation (18Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the structural changes in M1 close the cytoplasmic entry pathway, thereby resulting in occlusion of the bound Ca2+ ions (21Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24Sorensen T.L. Moller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This proposal is in agreement with functional studies demonstrating that mutation of Asp59, located right at the bending point, and mutation of Leu65, suggested to lock the conformation of Glu309, as well as mutations of other hydrophobic residues in M1 interfere with Ca2+ occlusion (27Einholm A.P. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15888-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase in the Ca2E1 form, it was also proposed that Asp59 and three other negatively charged residues in the N-terminal part of M1 and its cytoplasmic extension provide a cytoplasmic entry port to the Ca2+ sites (28Lee A.G. East J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 665-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence homology between the Na+,K+-ATPase and the Ca2+-ATPase is rather low in the M1 region (Fig. 1), and it is therefore unclear whether M1 has similar functions in the two ATPases. The presence of two positively charged (Lys86 and Arg89) and one negatively charged (Glu83) side chains in the N-terminal part of M1 of the Na+,K+-ATPase and its cytoplasmic extension versus four carboxylate groups in the same region of the Ca2+-ATPase (see Fig. 1) is reminiscent of voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels, where the ion selectivity filter is formed by two negatively charged side chains and one positive side chain in the Na+ channel and by four negatively charged side chains in the Ca2+ channel (29Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 30Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6786-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Lys86 is fully conserved throughout the Na+,K+-ATPase family, as is the positive charge at position 89 (arginine or lysine); hence it might be hypothesized that M1 and its cytosolic extension contributes to a cation selectivity filter. In a recent study of the two glycines, Gly93 and Gly94, in the M1 segment of the Na+,K+-ATPase (31Einholm A.P. Toustrup-Jensen M. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11254-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we found that Gly94 is critical for proper Na+ and K+ interaction, particularly in the E2P form. So far, this is the only study characterizing the importance of M1 in the Na+,K+-ATPase for cation interaction. In this study of the Na+,K+-ATPase, we have introduced 26 point mutations in M1 and its cytoplasmic extension and analyzed the consequences for the overall and partial reactions. Two possible alignments of the sequences of the Na+,K+-ATPase and the Ca2+-ATPase in this region are shown in Fig. 1 together with the amino acid replacements analyzed in the present and the previous study (31Einholm A.P. Toustrup-Jensen M. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11254-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The residues selected for mutagenesis were initially examined by alanine scanning except in the case of the tryptophan (Trp100), which was replaced by leucine to avoid a too drastic reduction in size. Because one aim of this study was to examine the roles of the charged and polar residues in the N-terminal part with a view to the possibility that they might contribute to cation selectivity, Lys86 and Arg89 were replaced not only by alanine but also by glutamate, which according to the alignment in Fig. 1A is the corresponding residue in the Ca2+-ATPase. Moreover, the glutamine Gln90 (highly conserved according to the alignment by Sweadner and Donnet (7Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 1B) was replaced by leucine and arginine in addition to alanine, the rationale behind the choice of arginine being that its bulkiness and positive charge would interfere with cation migration to the binding site, if the glutamine were located along the cation pathway. Leu91 was likewise replaced not only by alanine but also by proline in order to test the importance of the helical structure of the N-terminal part of M1, which probably is distorted by insertion of the “helix breaker” proline. Because alanine replacement of Phe95 led to a nonfunctional enzyme, the importance of the phenylalanine was studied further by substitution with tyrosine, arginine, and leucine, whose side chains differ in polarity, charge, and aromaticity but have bulkiness similar to that of the phenylalanine. According to the alignment shown in Fig. 1B, the leucine found important for Ca2+ occlusion in the Ca2+-ATPase (Leu65) is conserved in the Na+,K+-ATPase (Leu99), and because the first series of mutations in this study showed that the alanine replacement of Leu99 affects K+ binding markedly, this interesting residue was further studied by replacement with isoleucine, phenylalanine, and glutamine. We demonstrate that the side chains of specific residues in the middle part of M1, particularly Leu99, are critical for K+ interaction of the enzyme. Our findings are consistent with a gate-locking function of Leu99 in the K+-occluded [K2]E2 state, restricting the conformational flexibility of the side chain of the gating residue Glu329 in M4, and the data furthermore indicate a crucial role for Leu99 in K+ binding to the E2P form. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression—Mutations were introduced directly into the full-length cDNA of the ouabain resistant rat α1-isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase (32Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) contained in the expression vector pMT2 (33Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) by use of the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For expression, the resulting recombinant plasmids were transfected into mammalian COS-1 cells, and stable clones were selected with ouabain as described previously (5Vilsen B. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 624: 1-146PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The crude plasma membrane fraction containing expressed wild-type or mutant Na+,K+-ATPase was isolated by differential centrifugation (32Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined by the dye binding method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). Prior to functional analysis, the plasma membranes were made leaky with alamethicin or deoxycholate. The presence of the desired mutations in the cDNA was verified by sequencing the CsCl gradient purified cDNA before transfection into the COS-1 cells, and in some cases the DNA stably integrated into the genome of the isolated ouabain-resistant COS-1 cell lines was also sequenced. For the latter purpose, genomic DNA was isolated using the GenElute mammalian genomic DNA miniprep kit (Sigma). Information about the exon-intron boundaries allowed design of primers that selectively anneal to the exon-exon boundaries of the exogenous cDNA stably integrated into the genome and not to the endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase genomic DNA. Using these primers, the entire coding region of the exogenous mutant cDNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Functional Analysis—Measurements of ATPase activity were performed as described previously by following the liberation of Pi (11Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13340-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The catalytic turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the active site concentration (the maximum capacity for phosphorylation measured at 0 °C in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and oligomycin) (36Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For steady-state and transient kinetic measurements of partial reactions, a manual mixing technique or a quench-flow module (QFM-5 or SFM-400/Q, Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) was used, according to previously described principles and as detailed in the legends to the figures.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were analyzed as described. In all phosphorylation experiments, the reaction was terminated by acid quenching, and the acid-precipitated enzyme was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under acidic conditions (36Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the isolated Na+,K+-ATPase band on the gel was quantified using a Packard Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System. Data Analysis—All data represented in the figures and tables are average values of at least two (usually more) independent determinations performed on different enzyme preparations. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS Inc.) (37Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To analyze the ouabain concentration dependence of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, a function represented by the sum of two hyperbolic components, a high affinity component corresponding to endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase and a low affinity component corresponding to recombinant exogenous rat enzyme, was fitted to the data (39Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The other ligand concentration dependences were analyzed by applying the Hill equation. A biexponential function was fitted to the time courses of ADP/ATP-induced dephosphorylation, whereas a monoexponential function was fitted to the time courses of E1 phosphorylation and K+-induced dephosphorylation. The time course of K+ deocclusion was analyzed using the biphasic time function described previously (18Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in which the component corresponding to the rapid phase is at maximum from the beginning. The best fits are shown as lines in the figures, and the extracted parameters with the standard errors calculated by the SigmaPlot program are given in the tables or in the text. In the tables, the largest deviations from wild type are highlighted in boldface. Expression, Ouabain Sensitivity, and Catalytic Turnover Rate—The 26 point mutations investigated in this study are shown in Fig. 1 together with the two previously investigated glycine mutations (31Einholm A.P. Toustrup-Jensen M. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11254-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced into the cDNA encoding the ouabain-resistant rat α1-isoform of the Na+,K+-ATPase. For expression of recombinant wild-type and mutant enzyme in COS-1 cells, the ouabain selection methodology was used. This expression strategy takes advantage of the difference in ouabain sensitivity between the endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase (K0.5 ∼ 0.3 μm) and the exogenous rat Na+,K+-ATPase (K0.5 > 100 μm), permitting isolation of stable cell lines expressing exogenous rat Na+,K+-ATPase in the presence of 5 μm ouabain because of the preferential inhibition of the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase (5Vilsen B.

Of the 26 mutants constructed, all except F95A, F95R, and L99A were able to confer ouabain resistance to the COS-1 cells grown in the presence of 5 mm K+, 155 mm Na+, and 5 μm ouabain, indicating that the mutant enzymes were able to transport Na+ and K+ at a rate compatible with cell viability. The inability of F95A, F95R, and L99A to confer ouabain resistance indicated that the rate of Na+ and/or K+ transport was below the critical limit for cell survival under the prevailing conditions. Importantly, the cells expressing L99A could be rescued by increasing the K+ concentration in the growth medium to 10 mm and lowering the ouabain concentration to 1 μm, indicating that the affinity for extracellular K+ was reduced and the affinity for ouabain increased in this mutant. The functional characteristics of the mutants isolated from the viable cells were examined as described below (for overview, see tables). To study the effects of the mutations on the ouabain sensitivity, the ouabain concentration dependence of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was determined, and the K0.5 value for ouabain inhibition of the exogenous expressed rat enzyme is shown in Table 1. Relative to the wild-type enzyme, the apparent affinity for ouabain was increased 2–6-fold (K0.5 reduced) in L91P, F95L, L99A, and L99I, whereas a significant reduction of the ouabain affinity (K0.5 increased) was observed for F87Q and W100L (2–3-fold, cf. Table 1). The K0.5 value for ouabain inhibition displayed by the remaining mutants differed less than 2-fold from that of the wild type. To eliminate any contribution from endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase in the measurements of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation described below, ouabain was included in the reaction medium (1 μm for L91P, F95L, L99A, and L99I, and 10 μm for the remaining mutants).TABLE 1Analysis of the overall ATPase reactionK0.5 (ouabain inhibition)aData are from the ouabain dependence of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity at 37 °C. The medium contained 30 mm histidine buffer (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and various concentrations of ouabain. A function with the ouabain-inhibited enzyme represented by the sum of two hyperbolic components (V = Vtot - a1[ouabain]/(K1 + [ouabain]) - a2[ouabain]/(K2 + [ouabain])), a high affinity component corresponding to endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase and a low affinity component corresponding to recombinant exogenous rat Na+,K+-ATPase, was fitted to the data. The K0.5 value determined for the endogenous enzyme was ≤1.0 μm. The K0.5 values of the exogenous mutant enzymes are shown relative to that of the exogenous wild type determined in the same series of experiments (136 ± 5 μm).Catalytic turnover ratebThe catalytic turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the Na+,K+-ATPase activity, determined at 37 °C in the presence of 30 mm histidine buffer (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 μm ouabain (1 μm for L91P, F95L, L99A, and L99I), and the active site concentration (maximum capacity for phosphorylation measured at 0 °C in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and oligomycin) (36). The turnover rates are shown relative to that of the wild type (8474 ± 165 min-1).K0.5(ATP)cData were obtained as for Fig. 3. K0.5 values obtained by fitting a Hill function are shown relative to that of the wild type determined in the same series of experiments (429 ± 15 μm). Because mutants L99A and L99F were inhibited by high ATP concentrations, a biphasic function with an activating phase and an inhibition phase represented by the sum of two Hill components was used for fitting the data in these cases, and the K0.5 value shown in the table corresponds to the activating phase.K0.5(K+)dData obtained as for Fig. 4. K0.5 values are shown relative to that of the wild type determined in the same series of experiments (582 ± 17 μm).K0.5(VO43-)eData are from the vanadate dependence of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity at 37 °C. The medium contained 30 mm histidine buffer (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm ouabain (1 μm for L91P, F95L, L99A, and L99I), and various concentrations of vanadate. The equation V = Vmax(1 - [VO43-]n/(K0.5n + [VO43-]n)) was fitted to the data. K0.5 values are shown relative to that of the wild type determined in the same series of experiments (2.69 ± 0.08 μm).Wild type1.001.001.001.001.00E83A0.77 ± 0.070.98 ± 0.020.77 ± 0.080.94 ± 0.041.19 ± 0.06K86A1.51 ± 0.130.94 ± 0.050.97 ± 0.080.84 ± 0.031.37 ± 0.07K86E1.24 ± 0.081.05 ± 0.030.97 ± 0.030.87 ± 0.020.97 ± 0.03F87A1.40 ± 0.100.93 ± 0.020.64 ± 0.030.93 ± 0.041.54 ± 0.08F87Q3.23 ± 0.190.56 ± 0.020.62 ± 0.050.55 ± 0.051.36 ± 0.07R89A1.25 ± 0.111.28 ± 0.050.95 ± 0.110.86 ± 0.031.08 ± 0.07R89E0.89 ± 0.091.13 ± 0.010.72 ± 0.041.04 ± 0.041.23 ± 0.07Q90A1.30 ± 0.100.96 ± 0.010.49 ± 0.020.95 ± 0.032.31 ± 0.11Q90L0.96 ± 0.080.93 ± 0.030.84 ± 0.091.09 ± 0.031.08 ± 0.04Q90R0.96 ± 0.110.89 ± 0.050.49 ± 0.021.50 ± 0.042.33 ± 0.18L91A1.11 ± 0.140.92 ± 0.050.50 ± 0.021.27 ± 0.052.63 ± 0.23L91P0.41 ± 0.130.21 ± 0.020.46 ± 0.032.01 ± 0.201.47 ± 0.14F92A0.65 ± 0.040.87 ± 0.031.05 ± 0.071.29 ± 0.031.03 ± 0.07F95L0.38 ± 0.020.86 ± 0.030.28 ± 0.052.57 ± 0.055.13 ± 0.39F95Y0.76 ± 0.081.02 ± 0.050.32 ± 0.021.85 ± 0.044.61 ± 0.31F95ANDfND indicates not determined because the mutations disturbed the function or expression to such an extent that the cells were unable to survive.NDNDNDNDF95RNDNDNDNDNDS96A0.66 ± 0.041.05 ± 0.051.07 ± 0.091.27 ± 0.031.20 ± 0.07M97A1.28 ± 0.101.13 ± 0.060.52 ± 0.181.17 ± 0.041.55 ± 0.12L98A0.70 ± 0.040.96 ± 0.050.38 ± 0.032.16 ± 0.073.75 ± 0.37L99A0.33 ± 0.030.39 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.023.33 ± 0.055.39 ± 0.33L99I0.18 ± 0.020.87 ± 0.050.34 ± 0.022.72 ± 0.061.93 ± 0.11L99F1.25 ± 0.080.37 ± 0.030.20 ± 0.081.57 ± 0.06>80L99Q1.69 ± 0.221.00 ± 0.040.73 ± 0.050.92 ± 0.071.11 ± 0.06W100L2.36 ± 0.150.79 ± 0.030.70 ± 0.030.60 ± 0.031.06 ± 0.05I101A0.71 ± 0.050.95 ± 0.050.70 ± 0.031.67 ± 0.050.92 ± 0.07E329Q0.30 ± 0.01gData are from Refs. 18 and 35.0.12 ± 0.016.1gData are from Refs. 18 and 35.∼27a Data are from the ouabain dependence of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity at 37 °C.

Fibrillar collagen in its native form inhibits cell proliferation, whereas in its monomeric form it stimulates proliferation.

Werb Z. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). During tumor progression significant changes occur in the interactions between tumor cells and the ECM. For example, during early stages of melanoma progression, characterized by a radial growth, melanoma cells are confined to the epidermis and have little interaction with the ECM (2Elder D. Acta Oncol. 1999; 38: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Satyamoorthy K. Herlyn M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, as melanoma progresses toward a vertical growth phase, tumor cells invade the basement membrane and the adjacent dermis and become exposed to many ECM proteins, including type I collagen, the most abundant protein in the body (4Karsenty G. Park R.W. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 12: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Pilcher B.K. Sudbeck B.D. Dumin J.A. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. Arch. Dermatol.

Type I collagen can have either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, and this is determined as a function of its native structure. When present in a monomeric fibrillar or denatured form (gelatin), type I collagen acts as a growth stimulatory protein by promoting integrin clustering and activation of focal adhesion kinase (6Xia H.

However, when present in its native organized fibrillar form, type I collagen has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cell types, including vascular and bladder smooth muscle cells (8Koyama H.

It has also been shown that the growth inhibitory activity of fibrillar collagen (FC) on tumor cells involves an arrest at the G0/G1 to S phase transition (7Henriet P. Zhong Z.D. Brooks P.C.

Progression through the cell cycle is dependent upon the activity of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, which is regulated by the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) (14Hengstschlager M.

The observation that cells cultured on FC have elevated levels of p27KIP1 suggested that this elevation was responsible for FC-induced cell cycle arrest (7Henriet P. Zhong Z.D. Brooks P.C.

Here we have tested whether p27KIP1 was necessary for the inhibitory effect of FC by down-regulating p27KIP1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in melanoma cells cultured on FC. Our data revealed that p27KIP1 is not necessary for cell cycle arrest and point to an important role that p15INK4b and p21CIP1 play in the complex control of FC on cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against p19INK4d (M-167), p21CIP1 (C-19), p27KIP1 (C-19), and Skp2 (H-435) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Murine monoclonal antibodies against p15INK4b (Ab-6), p18INK4c (Ab-3), and p57KIP2 (Ab-5) were from Lab Vision Corp. (Fremont, CA), and the anti-β-tubulin antibody (Clone Tub 2.1) was from Sigma.Cell Lines—M24met cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cell images were captured using a CKX41 inverted microscope (Olympus) with a Microfire digital color camera, 4Mpixel (Optronics).Preparation of Collagen—To prepare monomeric-fibrillar collagen (MFC), 0.01 m HCl was used to dilute a skin bovine type I collagen stock (Angiotech Biomaterials) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. FC was prepared by neutralizing the acidic collagen with 1 m NaOH according to the manufacturer’s instructions to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Collagen was incubated at 37 °C for a minimum of 5 h and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) before cell addition. We confirmed this method generated FC by transmitted electron microscopy that showed the presence of collagen fibers with the characteristic periodic striation.Cell Collection, Protein Isolation, and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Subconfluent cells were harvested and plated on the specific collagen matrices and collected after the desired time. Cells on MFC were harvested by trypsin/EDTA dissociation, whereas cells on FC were collected using collagenase A (2.5 mg/ml) (Roche Applied Science). Cell number was determined with a hemacytometer. Following collection, cells were rinsed with PBS, pelleted, and lysed with modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 mg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysis was completed by vortexing three times for 10 s with a 10-min incubation on ice between each vortexing. Lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm) and the supernates transferred to a fresh tube. The protein concentration in the lysates was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For FACS analysis, cells were collected, rinsed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol (in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Following fixation, nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml RNase A in PBS, rinsed with PBS, and then resuspended at 3 × 106 nuclei/ml in 40 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS. Nuclei were then passed through a cell strainer and analyzed on an EPICS Elite ESP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using Expo 32 (version 1.2) software. The data were expressed as a percentage of total cells excluding apoptotic/necrotic cells, which contributed to an average of 6.5 ± 0.8% of the total of untransfected cells and an average of 14.2 ± 1.3% of transfected cells.Western Blotting—Proteins (20 μg of total cell lysate) processed by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk powder in washing solution (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and the primary antibody was incubated at 4 °C overnight. A monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody was used at a 1:1,000 dilution, and all other primary antibodies were used at 1 μg/ml. Blots were developed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature and Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were quantified using Labworks Imaging and Analysis Software (UVP, Upland, CA).siRNA—The following siRNA sequences were used: p15, 5′-AACTCAGTGCAAACGCCTAGA-3′ (NM_004936, base pairs 1833-1853); p21, 5′-AACATACTGGCCTGGACTGTT-3′ (NM_000389, base pairs 1941-1961); p27, 5′-AATGATCTGCCTCTAAAAGCG-3′ (AY004255, base pairs 925-945); Skp2, 5′-AAAAGCATGTACAGGTGGCTG-3′ (NM_005983, base pairs 994-1014). Cells were cultured in T150 culture flasks (Corning) in RPMI 1640, containing 10% fetal calf serum, without antibiotics until 80% confluence was reached. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS, and siRNA was added for 5 h at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated for 72 h before being used in specific experiments. For siRNA transfection we prepared the following reagents: tube 1 containing 61 μl of siRNA (20 μm stock; Qiagen) and 2.2 ml of RPMI 1640, and tube 2 containing 90 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 2.16 ml of RPMI 1640. Dual siRNA reactions had equal amounts of siRNA. Tubes were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then combined and incubated for a further 20 min. Next, 13.5 ml of RPMI 1640 was added and the siRNA mix was added to the cells. Final siRNA concentration was 68 nm (or 136 nm for dual). Transfection efficiency was assessed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled siRNA and viewing cells after 5 h with a Leica MZ FL III fluorescence stereomicroscope and 75W Xenon arc lamp and triple pass filter set. In all experiments, the transfection efficiency was 90 ± 2.6%.RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction—RNA was isolated from cell pellets using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and purity were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 mm, and the integrity was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. For each 20-μl reaction, 500 ng of total RNA was added in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, with 500 μm each dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 units of RNase inhibitor, 500 ng of N9 random oligonucleotide, and 200 units of M-MLV-RT (Invitrogen). Reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 2.5 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction mix was added to 25 μl of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 200 μm each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 units of Taq polymerase, and 500 pm forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen). PCR cycle conditions for primers were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 51 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and then 72 °C for 10 min. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were added after 5 cycles at 500 pm/reaction. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Primer sequences are available upon request.Statistical Analysis—Data were considered to have a parametric distribution. Therefore, a Student’s t-test (two-tail) assuming equal variance was used, with p < 0.05 being considered significant.RESULTSDown-regulation of p27KIP1 Does Not Prevent FC-induced Cell Cycle Arrest—We first examined the levels of p27KIP1 in M24met cells plated on FC over 48 h. Consistent with our previous report (7Henriet P. Zhong Z.D. Brooks P.C. Weinberg K.I. DeClerck Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10026-10031Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) we observed an increase in p27KIP1 protein levels at 12 h that was maintained at least up to 48 h (Fig. 1A). To determine whether p27KIP1 was necessary for the growth inhibitory effect of FC, we used transient transfection with a p27KIP1 siRNA to specifically down-regulate p27KIP1. Transfection of M24met cells with a p27KIP1 siRNA completely suppressed p27KIP1 expression for at least 72 h after transfection (Fig. 1B). A cell cycle analysis performed 72 h after transfection, on cells plated for 24 h on FC, did not indicate a difference in the distribution of the phases of the cell cycle between cells transfected with the p27KIP1 siRNA, scrambled siRNA, or Lipofectamine alone (Fig. 1C). Additionally, no difference was detected in cell number between cells transfected with p27KIP1 siRNA or scrambled siRNA when cultured on FC (Fig. 1D). The data thus suggest that, although elevated in the presence of FC, p27KIP1 is not a necessary regulator of cell cycle progression in melanoma cells plated in contact with FC.Down-regulation of Skp2 Does Not Affect M24met Proliferation on MFC—The levels of p27KIP1 in cells are controlled by proteasome degradation following p27KIP1 polyubiquitinylation via the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complex (17Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 18Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The F-box protein that provides the SCF complex specificity for p27KIP1 is Skp2. Consistent with Skp2 being a regulator of p27KIP1 expression in M24met cells, we observed a corresponding down-regulation of Skp2 in M24met cells plated on FC as the levels of p27KIP1 increased (Fig. 2A). Down-regulation of Skp2 by siRNA in these cells (Fig. 2B), however, did not affect their cell cycle distribution in the presence of MFC (Fig. 2C) and did not inhibit the proliferation of M24met cells on MFC (Fig. 2D). This lack of effect occurred even though down-regulation of Skp2 resulted in elevated levels of p27KIP1 on MFC (Fig. 2E). These data provide a second line of evidence that p27KIP1 is not responsible for the growth regulatory effect of collagen.FIGURE 2Down-regulation of Skp2 does not affect M24met proliferation on MFC.

This analysis indicated an increase in p15INK4b mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B) 24 h after contact with FC. There were, however, no changes in the expression of p18INK4b, p19INK4b, p21CIP1, and p57KIP2, and p16INK4a was not expressed. Thus the data suggested that p15INK4b could be responsible for the G0/G1-S growth arrest observed in the presence of FC.FIGURE 3p15INK4b levels are elevated on FC.

Interestingly, down-regulation of p15INK4b in these cells prevented the G0/G1 arrest on FC (55.8 ± 1.1% of cells transfected with p15INK4b siRNA were in G0/G1 compared with 84.1 ± 1.3% of cells transfected with scrambled siRNA, p = 0.0001) (Fig. 4B). However, down-regulation of p15INK4b increased the percentage of cells in G2/M from 9.9 ± 1 to 38.2 ± 0.6% when compared with cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA (p = 0.00002). Consistent with this arrest at G2, down-regulation of p15INK4b in M24met cells did not result in an increase in cell proliferation (Fig. 4C). The data thus suggest that p15INK4b, although necessary for the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1-S by FC, is not the sole factor inhibiting cell proliferation on FC. Because it has previously been suggested that the action of FC in inducing aG0/G1 arrest is linked to the ability of FC to prevent cell spreading (13Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 629-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether these inhibitors could be involved in the G2 arrest upon down-regulation of p15INK4b in M24met cells, we examined their expression in M24met cells transfected with p15INK4b siRNA. Although the level of p27KIP1 remained unchanged, we observed an increase in the levels of p21CIP1 upon down-regulation of p15INK4b (Fig. 5A). To determine the significance of this increase in p21CIP1 expression we measured the effect of simultaneously down-regulating p15INK4b and p21CIP1 on cell cycle progression in M24met cells plated on FC, using transfection with siRNA (Fig. 5B). This experiment indicated that upon down-regulation of p15INK4b and p21CIP, the percentage of cells in G2 decreased from 38.17 ± 0.66% (p15INK4b siRNA alone) to 23.1 ± 2.7% (Fig. 5C). At the same time, the percent of cells in G0/G1 increased from 55.77 ± 1.1 (p15INK4b siRNA alone) to 67.6 ± 2.7% and in S phase from 6.07 ± 0.5 (p15INK4b siRNA alone) to 9.3 ± 2.5% (Fig. 5C). Although the S phase increase is small, it represents a 50% increase when compared with cells in which only p15 was down-regulated. Consistent with this increase in cells in S phase, we found that dual suppression of p15INK4b and p21CIP expression in M24met cells plated on FC stimulated proliferation by 146 ± 10% at 24 h (p = 0.006) and by 177 ± 11% at 72 h (p = 0.009) compared with 97 ± 6 and 106 ± 7% with scrambled siRNAs, respectively (Fig. 5D). This level of stimulation was, however, lower than when cells were plated on MFC (404 ± 21% after 72 h; p = 0.0003, data not shown). Changes in cell cycle and proliferation in the presence of FC were not associated with changes in morphology, suggesting a mechanism independent of cell spreading (Fig. 5E). p21CIP1 siRNA alone had a minimal effect on cell cycle distribution and did not significantly increase cell proliferation (data not shown), indicating that it is the cooperation between p15INK4b and p21CIP1 that is responsible for the cell cycle arrest observed when M24met cells are plated in the presence of FC.FIGURE 5Simultaneous down-regulation of p15INK4b and p21CIP1 stimulates proliferation of FC.

Type I collagen is unique as it has been shown to stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation as a function of its structural state. When organized in a cross-linked multimeric structure, collagen inhibits the proliferation of normal cells as well as malignant cells (7Henriet P. Zhong Z.D. Brooks P.C. Weinberg K.I. DeClerck Y.A.

In contrast, in the absence of this multimeric organization or when denatured by heat or proteolytic degradation, type I collagen promotes cell spreading, integrin binding, and clustering, activation of focal adhesions, and cell proliferation (7Henriet P.

To help guide policy in Vietnam, we studied the epidemiology of HIV-associated TB in one province and examined factors associated with outcomes, including the impact of CTX use.We retrospectively abstracted data for all HIV-infected persons diagnosed with TB from 2001-2004 in An Giang, a province in southern Vietnam in which TB patients receive HIV counseling and testing. We used standard WHO definitions to classify TB treatment outcomes. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify risk factors for the composite outcome of death, default, or treatment failure during TB treatment. From 2001-2004, 637 HIV-infected TB patients were diagnosed in An Giang. Of these, 501 (79%) were male, 321 (50%) were aged 25-34 years, and the most common self-reported HIV risk factor was sex with a commercial sex worker in 221 (35%). TB was classified as smear-positive in 531 (83%). During TB treatment, 167 (26%) patients died, 9 (1%) defaulted, and 6 (1%) failed treatment. Of 454 patients who took CTX, 116 (26%) had an unsuccessful outcome compared with 33 (70%) of 47 patients who did not take CTX (relative risk, 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.5). Adjusting for male sex, rural residence, TB smear status and disease location, and the occurrence of adverse events during TB treatment in multivariate analysis, the benefit of CTX persisted (adjusted odds ratio for unsuccessful outcome 0.1; CI, 0.1-0.3).In An Giang, Vietnam, HIV-associated TB was associated with poor TB treatment outcomes. Outcomes were significantly better in those taking CTX. This finding suggests that Vietnam should consider applying WHO recommendations to prescribe CTX to all HIV-infected TB patients."

Recent work demonstrates that the role of FADD in proliferation is mostly through regulation of the cell cycle machinery, although it is not clear whether FADD operates at the G2/M or G1/S transition of the cell cycle. FADD-null T cells exhibit intact membrane-proximal T cell activation events but display dys-regulated expression of many cell cycle proteins before and after T cell activation (15Zhang J. Kabra N.H.

Mouse and human FADD proteins are phosphorylated on equivalent serine residues (serine 191 in mouse and serine 194 in human) that reside within the C-terminal tail, a region outside the DD and death effector domain apoptotic domains (16Scaffidi C.

Our laboratory has previously shown that mice bearing a Ser-to-Asp mutation at serine 191 in FADD [FADD(S191D) or FADD-D], which mimics constitutive phosphorylation, exhibit proliferative but not apoptotic T cell defects (17Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanisms of defects in FADD-D T cells, however, have not been investigated. In this regard, we utilized the FADD-D mice to parse out the molecular mechanisms by which FADD is involved in the cell cycle regulation in T cells. In contrast to the cell line data, we show that FADD is phosphorylated within hours of mature T cell activation, correlating with entry into cell cycle. FADD-D T cell development is relatively normal in 2-4-week-old mice. However, their mature T cells have an impaired ability to proliferate in response to activation due to specific defects at the G1/S transition. These defects can be traced to a failure of FADD-D T cells to express FoxM1 protein. FoxM1 is a cell cycle-associated transcription factor that is important for the G1/S transition, as well as mitosis. During the G1/S transition, FoxM1 drives the transcription of components of the Skp1-Cullin 1-Fbox ubiquitin ligase complex, which is necessary for degradation of various cell cycle inhibitors (20Wang I.C.

Activated FADD-D T cells fail to down-regulate p27 and exhibit very little Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation and CDK2 activities. Furthermore, FADD-D has altered subcellular localization in the context of cell cycle progression. The latter is consistent with reports of preferential nuclear accumulation of human FADD protein in several cell lines and that phosphorylation at serine 194 is important for nuclear localization of FADD (19Alappat E.C.

For intracellular staining of BrdUrd, Ki67, and p130, T cells were column purified by negative selection (R&D Systems), cultured at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum and either not stimulated or stimulated with 2.5 mg/ml ConA and 1.25 ng/ml PMA for 2 or 4 days. For Ki67 staining, T cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Biosciences). For p130 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) staining, cells were processed and stained according to the protocol from Cell Signaling for intracellular staining using unconjugated primary antibodies. For BrdUrd labeling, T cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Processing and anti-BrdUrd fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag) staining was carried out following BD Biosciences protocol. Proliferation and Apoptosis Assay—T cells from lymph nodes and spleens were purified and cultured as stated previously and either not stimulated or stimulated with 2.5 mg/ml ConA and 1.25 ng/ml PMA for the indicated times. At various time points, cells were collected, counted by trypan blue exclusion, and subsequently stained with annexin V (BD Biosciences, according to protocol) and 20 ng/ml propidium iodide for flow cytometric analysis. Apoptotic cells were deemed propidium iodide-negative, annexin V-positive. Western Blotting—T cells were purified, cultured, and stimulated for various times as already described. Cells were pelleted and washed with PBS, and protein lysates were prepared in 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors. Protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad BCA reagents, and 5-10 μg of total protein was loaded onto either 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris saline buffer (0.1% Tween), and blotted for the various cell cycle proteins. The following antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: p21, cyclin D2, CDK6, CDK2, cyclin E, cyclin A, cdc2, p27, c-Myc, and p-Rb(Ser795). Anti-actin was from AbCam, and anti-FoxM1 was from Abnova. Generation of anti-FADD rabbit polyclonal antisera has been published previously (4Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay—T cells were not stimulated or stimulated with 1:1000 each of plate-bound anti-CD3 (500A2) and anti-CD28 (37N). Protein lysates were prepared in the following lysis buffer: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, plus protease inhibitors. CDK2 complexes were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using mouse monoclonal anti-CDK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and captured with protein G beads (Pierce). CDK2 immunoprecipitations were resuspended in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or 20 μg/ml GST·Rb substrate, where appropriate. Kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 30 °C, stopped with an equal volume of 2× reducing sample buffer, boiled, and run on 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were dried, exposed, and read on a PhosphorImager. The GST·Rb substrate was purified on glutathione beads as per a standard GST fusion protein preparation. Immunofluorescence—T cells were treated as indicated, harvested, and spun onto slides using the Cytospin system. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and then permeabilized/blocked in blocking solution (1× PBS, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% Triton, 3% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at room temperature. T cells were then stained with anti-FADD (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal) in blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with 1× PBS, 0.1% Triton, stained with 1:100 anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature, and washed three times as described above. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) was diluted into secondary antibody solution for nuclear stain. Slides were mounted with anti-fading solution (90% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.33% 1,4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2)-octane), sealed with nail polish, and analyzed on a confocal microscope at ×60 magnification. Normal Positive Selection in 2-4-week-old FADD-D Mice—Using the previously described FADD-D mice, we sought to understand the mechanism of the proliferative defects in FADD-D T cells. To determine whether improper thymocyte development in FADD-D mice might contribute to the mature T cell phenotype, we analyzed various aspects of the thymic compartments of FADD-D animals. As seen in Fig. 1A (left), FADD-D animals are runted, and this phenotype is exacerbated with age. The body weight of 2-4-week-old FADD-D mice is significantly less than that of littermate controls, and this difference increases with the 6-8-week age group. FADD-D thymi exhibit an apparent reduced cellularity, but since FADD-D animals are runted, we calculated the ratio of thymus size to body size (Fig. 1A). Although FADD-D thymi and body sizes were smaller than those of control mice in both age groups, the ratio of thymus weight to body weight was not significantly different between control and FADD-D mice, especially for the 2-4-week-old mice. These data suggest that the reduced thymic cellularity of 2-4-week-old FADD-D mice is in proportion to the overall decrease in mouse size. This is further supported by a relatively normal CD4/CD8 profile of FADD-D thymocytes (Fig. 1B). Taking into account the normalized absolute cell numbers for the four FADD-D thymic subsets (Fig. 1A), these young FADD-D mice have relatively normal numbers of CD4 and CD8 single positive cells, a small decrease of DN thymocytes, and a 2-fold decrease of DP thymocytes. The drop in the number of DP thymocytes is exacerbated for older mice (data not shown), possibly reflecting the increasing requirement for FADD in DN to DP transition in older but not young animals (8Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). To determine whether FADD-D T cells were being properly selected, we assayed for the expression of cell surface markers associated with thymocyte-positive selection. CD69 is expressed at very low levels on DN thymocytes but is up-regulated during positive selection. After positive selection, CD69 expression gradually decreases. In contrast, HSA is expressed at high levels on DN and DP thymocytes but is down-regulated gradually following positive selection (22Lucas B. Vasseur F. Penit C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). These typical expression patterns of CD69 and HSA are seen in the FADD-D thymocytes (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that positive selection is proceeding normally in FADD-D thymi. It was previously observed that FADD-D mice are slightly lymphopenic (17Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since a lymphopenic environment could cause naive T cells to proliferate, we analyzed the peripheral T cells of 3-week-old mice for evidence of homeostatic expansion. Homeostatic proliferating T cells express high levels of CD44 and, in contrast to antigen-activated T cells, maintain CD62L expression (23Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There was no increase in the representation of the CD44high CD62Lhigh population of T cells observed in the lymph nodes or spleen of either control or FADD-D animals (Fig. 1C), suggesting that homeostatic proliferation of FADD-D T cells is not occurring. FADD-D T Cells Exhibit Selective Cell Cycle Defects—As evidenced by the cell numbers following T cell activation over a 4-day period, FADD-D T cells do not proliferate (Fig. 2A) (17Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To more specifically assess this proliferative defect of FADD-D T cells, we analyzed for cell cycle progression using Ki67 staining and BrdUrd incorporation. Ki67 is a nuclear-associated antigen that is expressed solely in proliferating cells (24Scholzen T. Gerdes J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3541) Google Scholar). Naive control T cells do not express Ki67, but after 4 days of activation, the majority of T cells express Ki67, indicating that they are proliferating (Fig. 2B, top). However, Ki67 expression remains extremely low in FADD-D T cells after activation. BrdUrd incorporation at 2 days after activation exhibits similar results as described for Ki67 (Fig. 2B, middle). As both Ki67 expression and BrdUrd incorporation measure entry into G1 and/or S phase, we concluded that FADD-D T cells do not proliferate because of defects in cell cycle regulation associated with the G1 to S transition. Interestingly, in contrast to wild-type T cells, a small portion of non-stimulated FADD-D T cells expresses Ki67 and incorporates BrdUrd. This basal level of proliferation is not increased upon activation (Fig. 2B). The spontaneously cycling population of FADD-D T cells is further confirmed by intracellular staining for p130, a marker of quiescence (25Vairo G. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Mayol X. Garriga J. Grana X. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar, 27Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28Smith E.J. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6965-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Naive T cells from control mice express high levels of p130, which becomes down-regulated upon activation and entry into cell cycle (Fig. 2B, bottom). However, a small population of naive FADD-D T cells has already down-regulated p130 expression. It is interesting to consider that wild-type FADD is phosphorylated within hours of T cell stimulation, thus correlating with exit from quiescence and entry into cell cycle (Fig. 3A, top) (18O'Reilly L.A. Divisekera U. Newton K. Scalzo K. Kataoka T. Puthalakath H. Ito M. Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of FADD may be an important event associated not only with the G1/S but also with the G0/G1 transition. The failure of FADD-D T cells to go through cell cycle is accompanied by subsequent apoptosis. By annexin/propidium iodide staining, higher percentages of FADD-D T cells undergo apoptosis beginning at 24 h after stimulation. Thus, it appears that FADD-D T cells die in response to failed cell cycle progression (Fig. 2A, lower panel). FADD-D Interferes with FoxM1 Expression and Subsequent Downstream Events Necessary for S Phase Progression—To define how FADD-D interferes with cell cycle regulation, and thereby characterize the role of FADD in cell cycle, we compared expression patterns of a panel of cell cycle proteins by Western blot in naive and activated T cells from control and FADD-D mice. Although most cell cycle proteins exhibit normal expression patterns in FADD-D T cells (Fig. 3A), p27 and Rb are specifically affected. p27, a member of the Cip/Kip family of CDK inhibitors, binds to and blocks CDK activity (29Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Rb is a repressor of E2F transcription factors, which are important for regulating transcription of various cell cycle proteins (29Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 30Cobrinik D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2796-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 31Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 34Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Degradation of p27 and Rb phosphorylation cause release of CDK inhibition and E2F repression, respectively, events crucial for progression from G1 to S phase (30Cobrinik D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2796-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Although p27 degradation and phosphorylation of Rb are evident in activated control T cells, these events are largely absent in activated FADD-D T cells, indicating the block in FADD-D T cell proliferation occurs at the G1/S transition (Fig. 3, A and B). These data correlate with the previously described Ki67 and BrdUrd defects. CDK2 kinase is a key controller of both p27 and Rb regulation. Since CDK2 protein expression was fairly normal in FADD-D T cells, we assessed the activity of CDK2 in an in vitro immunoprecipitation/kinase assay (Fig. 3C). CDK2 kinase complexes were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of naive and activated control and FADD-D T cells. Using GST·Rb as the substrate, CDK2 kinase activity was measured by radiolabeled ATP incorporation. Although CDK2 complexes from activated control T cells are able to phosphorylate the GST·Rb substrate, CDK2 complexes from FADD-D activated T cells exhibit very little kinase activity. As a control, co-immunoprecipitated cyclin E was visualized by Western blot analysis. Thus, reduced CDK2 kinase activity likely contributes to the observed p27 and pRb defects of FADD-D T cells. FoxM1, a member of the Forkhead box family, is a major transcriptional regulator of the cell cycle (20Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 35Fung T.K. Poon R.Y. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36Costa R.H.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Its targets include cell cycle proteins associated with the G1/S transition, as well as the mitosis. FoxM1 is highly expressed in proliferating cells and is induced in T cells upon activation and entry into cell cycle (38Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because p27 degradation, Rb phosphorylation, and CDK2 activation are events downstream of the transcriptional network of FoxM1, we examined FoxM1 expression in FADD-D T cells. As seen in Fig. 4, naive T cells from control animals express a low level of FoxM1 protein, which increases after activation. In contrast, FADD-D T cells fail to express any detectable FoxM1 protein at any point before or after activation. To further substantiate the proliferation defect being specific to peripheral T cells of FADD-D mice, we found that FoxM1 is highly expressed in both FADD-D and control thymocytes. This suggests that FADD-D specifically impairs mature T cells in their ability to express FoxM1. To see whether this effect is specific for FoxM1, we examined c-Myc, another transcription factor associated with proliferation (39Berns A. Nature. 2005; 436: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 40Miyazaki T. Liu Z-J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. Barsoumian E.L. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1995; 81: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In contrast to FoxM1, both naive and activated FADD-D T cells exhibit a high level of c-Myc expression (Fig. 4). Thus, FADD-D T cells appear to be specifically defective in FoxM1 expression, which most likely explains their inability to proliferate in response to T cell stimulation. Constitutive Phosphorylation Causes Mislocalization of FADD during Cell Cycle Progression—Subcellular localization of FADD has been a controversial issue. For its function at the death receptors, FADD is cytoplasmic. However, FADD has also been shown to be nuclear in many cell types (19Alappat E.C. Feig C. Boyerinas B. Volkland J. Samuels M. Murmann A.E. Thorburn A. Kidd V.J. Slaughter C.A. Osborn S.L. Winoto A. Tang W.J. Peter M.E. Mol.

Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear localization of FADD may contribute to its role in cell cycle regulation. Using immunofluorescence microscopy on primary mouse T cells, we examined the localization of FADD in the context of cell cycle progression and phosphorylation status (Fig. 5). In naive wild-type T cells, FADD is primarily localized within the nucleus, although some must reside in the cytoplasm as naive T cells are sensitive to FasL-induced death (44Suda T. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3918-3924PubMed Google Scholar). After activation and subsequent phosphorylation, FADD translocates significantly to the cytoplasm. Like FADD, FADD-D protein is also primarily localized in the nucleus of naive T cells. However, in contrast to wild-type FADD, FADD-D protein fails to accumulate in the cytoplasm during cell cycle progression. Constitutive phosphorylation of FADD at serine 191 thus disrupts the proper localization of FADD during cell cycle. FADD is one of many molecules in a growing list that possesses roles in both apoptosis and proliferation (1Abrams J.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 403-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 45Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). To balance such intricately linked, yet opposing, processes requires exquisite control. Recent work in the field indicates that phosphorylation and subcellular localization may be important in the ability of FADD to compartmentalize its roles (19Alappat E.C. Feig C. Boyerinas B. Volkland J. Samuels M. Murmann A.E. Thorburn A. Kidd V.J. Slaughter C.A. Osborn S.L. Winoto A. Tang W.J. Peter M.E. Mol.

Using the previously characterized FADD-D mice (17Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we now provide the first molecular evidence for how FADD specifically regulates the early phases of cell cycle. Constitutive phosphorylation of FADD results in problems at both the G0/G1 and the G1/S transitions of the T cell cycle. Unstimulated FADD-D T cells spontaneously enter cell cycle, but upon activation, fail to progress through cell cycle due to molecular defects and mislocalization associated with G1/S transition. In human cell lines, the level of FADD phosphorylation is highest at G2/M and lowest at G1/S. This phosphorylation at G2/M is mediated by the CKIα kinase (19Alappat E.C. Feig C. Boyerinas B. Volkland J. Samuels M. Murmann A.E. Thorburn A. Kidd V.J. Slaughter C.A. Osborn S.L. Winoto A. Tang W.J. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We show here that FADD is also important in the early phases of the cell cycle. Our data for FADD-D support the notion that regulation of FADD phosphorylation is important for cell cycle progression. It is interesting to note that unlike primary T cells, the proliferative function of FADD has not been observed in transformed cell lines (9Yeh W-C. Pompa J.L McCurrach M.E Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 46Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this difference, we hypothesize that the proliferative role of FADD may be associated with the initial cell cycle entry, which is overcome in immortalized cell lines. Considering both the timing of FADD phosphorylation after T cell activation and the premature spontaneous entry of FADD-D T cells into cell cycle, our data appear to corroborate a role for FADD in the exit from quiescence. It is possible that improper exit from quiescence contributes to the subsequent G1 defects. Alternatively, FADD serine phosphorylation might be biphasic in primary T cells, occurring during G0 to G1 followed by a dephosphorylation event during the G1 to S transition and subsequent rephosphorylation at G2/M (as observed in cell lines). However, this phenomenon may be masked in a Western blot analysis due to an asynchronous nature of T cell activation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the CKIα pharmacological inhibitor, CKI-7, fails to inhibit the early FADD phosphorylation (within 5 h after stimulation), although it does block the late FADD phosphorylation at 24 h after stimulation (19Alappat E.C. Feig C. Boyerinas B. Volkland J. Samuels M. Murmann A.E. Thorburn A. Kidd V.J. Slaughter C.A. Osborn S.L. Winoto A. Tang W.J. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 3S. L. Osborn and A. Winoto, unpublished data. These data suggest that another kinase distinct from CKIα phosphorylates FADD in the early phase of cell cycle entry. We have identified the molecular defects of FADD-D T cells at the G1/S transition. The abnormal regulation of p27, pRb, and CDK2 can ultimately be attributed to the lack of FoxM1 expression, although c-Myc and other unknown cell cycle defects may also contribute to the FADD-D phenotype. The exact molecular link between FADD and FoxM1 is not clear. Interestingly, although FADD-D T cells constitutively express c-Myc, T cells from FADD-DN mice have been shown to have reduced levels of c-Myc after activation (47Chau H. Wong V. Chen N.J. Huang H.L. Lin W.J. Mirtsos C. Elford A.R. Bonnard M. Wakeham A. You-Ten A.I. Lemmers B. Salmena L. Pellegrini M. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Ohashi P. Yeh W.C. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This difference might be partly due to the presence of constitutively cycling FADD-D T cells. Like FADD-D T cells, FADD-DN T cells also exhibit proliferative defects in response to activation, but FADD-DN T cells do not spontaneously enter the cell cycle. Alternatively, the accumulation of c-Myc protein in FADD-D T cells could be due to the failure of stimulated FADD-D T cells to reach the late G1 stage of the cell cycle where derepression of GSK-3 kinase normally occurs (48Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 49Dominguez-Sola D. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 288-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In late G1 of normal cells, active GSK-3 phosphorylates c-Myc at threonine 58, leading to c-Myc protein ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation. Finally, it is equally plausible that FADD exerts effects on other, as of yet unidentified, aspects of c-Myc and FoxM1 regulation. The failure of FADD-D T cells to pass through S phase is also accompanied by subcellular mislocalization. Consistent with the observation that nuclear localization of human FADD in some cells is dependent upon phosphorylation of serine 194 (the equivalent position of mouse serine 191) (21Screaton R.A. Kiessling S. Sansom O.J. Millar C.B. Maddison K. Bird A. Clarke A.R. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5211-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 42Frisch S. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1361-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 43Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), FADD-D protein is localized primarily to the nucleus. However, unlike wild-type FADD, FADD-D protein fails to significantly accumulate in the cytoplasm following activation. Consistent with this datum, human phosphorylation-deficient FADD (S194A) protein, in contrast to wild-type human protein, resides mostly in the cytoplasm (21Screaton R.A. Kiessling S. Sansom O.J. Millar C.B. Maddison K. Bird A. Clarke A.R. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5211-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of unmapped threonine phosphorylation sites in mouse FADD (4Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), phosphorylation-deficient FADD mutant mice have not yet been generated, and FADD(S191A) T cells are phenotypically normal (17Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The failure of FADD-D protein to distribute appropriately between nuclear and cytoplasm might be related to the proliferation-associated molecular defects. FADD-D T cells still maintain the capacity to induce apoptosis through the death receptors, and thus, a small pool of FADD and FADD-D must normally reside within the cytoplasm. Presumably, this small cytoplasmic pool is undetectable by immunofluorescence. Although our understanding of the mechanism of the role of FADD in cell cycle is far from complete, we conclude that serine phosphorylation status, and consequently, appropriate localization, is a major mechanism by which FADD functions to control cell cycle entry. As FADD has no known enzymatic activities, one possible scenario is for serine phosphorylated FADD to act as an adapter protein for cell cycle related proteins. Regulation of the FADD serine phosphorylation, its subcellular localization, and the nucleation of the associated cell cycle proteins might then regulate different phases of the cell cycle in activated T cells. Identification and characterization of these FADD-interacting proteins will be necessary to fully understand how FADD functions as a proliferation apoptosis coupler.

Reported here are two crystal structures of the IPNV VP4 protease solved from two different crystal symmetries. The electron density at the active site in the triclinic crystal form, refined to 2.2-Å resolution, reveals the acyl-enzyme complex formed with an internal VP4 cleavage site. The complex was generated using a truncated enzyme in which the general base lysine was substituted. Inside the complex, the nucleophilic Ser633Oγ forms an ester bond with the main-chain carbonyl of the C-terminal residue, Ala716, of a neighboring VP4. The structure of this substrate-VP4 complex allows us to identify the S1, S3, S5, and S6 substrate binding pockets as well as other substrate-VP4 interactions and therefore provides structural insights into the substrate specificity of this enzyme. The structure from the hexagonal crystal form, refined to 2.3-Å resolution, reveals the free-binding site of the protease. Three-dimensional alignment with the VP4 of blotched snakehead virus, another birnavirus, shows that the overall structure of VP4 is conserved despite a low level of sequence identity (∼19%). The structure determinations of IPNV VP4, the first of an acyl-enzyme complex for a Ser/Lys dyad protease, provide insights into the catalytic mechanism and substrate recognition of this type of protease.

The structure determinations of IPNV VP4, the first of an acyl-enzyme complex for a Ser/Lys dyad protease, provide insights into the catalytic mechanism and substrate recognition of this type of protease. Birnaviruses are non-enveloped viruses of ∼60–70 nm in diameter, which replicate in the cytoplasm of their host cells (1Espinoza J.C. Hjalmarsson A. Everitt E. Kuznar J. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and are characterized by their two double-stranded RNA genomic segments (A and B) (2Dobos P. Hill B.J. Hallett R. Kells D.T. Becht H. Teninges D. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 593-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Segment A displays two overlapping reading frames, the larger one encoding a polyprotein (NH2-pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH; Fig. 1). The polyprotein is processed through the proteolytic activity of VP4 to generate the proteins pVP2 and VP3 as well as VP4 (3Petit S. Lejal N. Huet J.C. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). During virus assembly, pVP2 is further processed by VP4 to generate the capsid protein VP2 and several structural peptides. The crystal structure of the infectious bursal disease virus particle (an avian birnavirus) solved at a resolution of 7 Å revealed the VP2 protein incorporated into an iscosahedral viral capsid with triangulation T = 13 (4Coulibaly F.

The Birnaviridae virus family includes three genera, Aquabirnavirus, Avibirnavirus, and Entomobirnavirus, which infect fish, birds, and insects, respectively (5Delmas B. Kibenge F.S.B. Leong J.C.

Because of the high mortality rate it induces and its widespread distribution, this virus is a major economical and ecological threat to the aquaculture and sea farming industry worldwide (8Reno P.

Virology. 1995; 208: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The IPNV VP4 protease cleaves its own N and C termini in the polyprotein after the amino acids 508 and 734, respectively. Three cleavage sites within pVP2 are located after amino acid residues 442, 486, and 495. The resulting products are VP2 (aa 1–442 of the polypeptide), p1 (aa 443–486), p2 (aa 487–495), p3 (aa 496–508), VP4 (aa 509–734), and VP3 (aa 735–972). The peptides p1, p2, and p3 are present in the virions but may also be further processed into additional cleaved products (9Galloux M. Chevalier C. Henry C. Huet J.C. Costa B.D. Delmas B. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There is a reported internal cleavage site near the C-terminal end of VP4 itself, which differs from the consensus cleavage sequence (3Petit S. Lejal N. Huet J.C. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The main cleavage sites and those involved in the processing of pVP2 have been described by the consensus (Ser/Thr)-X-Ala↓(Ser/Ala)-Gly motif (Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis studies on IPNV VP4 protease show that the conserved catalytic residues Ser633 and Lys674 are essential for polyprotein processing (3Petit S. Lejal N. Huet J.C. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar results are found for the VP4 protease in the blotched snakehead virus (BSNV; Ser692 and Lys729) (10Da Costa B. Soignier S. Chevalier C. Henry C. Thory C. Huet J.C. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBVD; Ser652 and Lys692) (11Birghan C. Mundt E. Gorbalenya A.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Lejal N. Da Costa B. Huet J.C. Delmas B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The VP4 proteases of the Birnaviridae family, therefore, are proposed to utilize a Ser/Lys catalytic dyad mechanism to catalyze the processing of the polyprotein (3Petit S. Lejal N. Huet J.C. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Birghan C. Mundt E. Gorbalenya A.E.

This property distinguishes VP4 proteases from other viral proteases. The recently solved crystal structure of VP4 protease from BSNV supports previous findings suggesting that VP4 is a Ser/Lys protease. It also revealed that, despite almost no sequence similarity, VP4 is structurally similar to the Lon proteases (13Feldman A.R. Lee J. Delmas B. Paetzel M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1378-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Botos I. Melnikov E.E. Cherry S. Kozlov S. Makhovskaya O.V. Tropea J.E. Gustchina A. Rotanova T.V. Wlodawer A. J. Mol.

Here we report x-ray crystal structures of the IPNV VP4 protease in the unbound form (free binding site) and the product bound form (acyl-enzyme complex). The acyl-enzyme complex corresponds to an intermolecular (trans-cleavage) event at an internal cleavage site within VP4. The structure determinations allow for the identification of many of the molecular interactions important for substrate recognition. Cloning and Mutagenesis—In an attempt to generate crystals suitable for structure determination, many different truncated and mutant forms of IPNV VP4 protease have been generated (23Lee J. Feldman A.R. Chiu E. Chan C. Kim Y.N. Delmas B. Paetzel M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 1235-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Two of these IPNV VP4 protease constructs are described here. A pET-28b plasmid encoding a truncated form of the IPNV VP4 gene (residues 514–734) was used as the initial DNA template (3Petit S. Lejal N. Huet J.C. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The codon for Lys674 was changed to a codon for alanine using site-directed mutagenesis by PCR. The codon for Lys717 was mutated to a stop codon. The expression product from this plasmid VP4_514–716,K674A (VP4tri) is 204 residues long (including initial methionine) with a molecular mass of 21.7 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.5. The plasmid for VP4tri was then used as a template in a PCR reaction to amplify a DNA segment encoding VP4_524–716,K674A (VP4hex). It was cloned into pET-24a (Novagen) via the NdeI and SalI restriction sites. The resulting expressed protein is 194 residues long (including the initial methionine) with a molecular mass of 20.5 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.3. Sequencing was performed to confirm each DNA construct. Expression and Purification of Selenomethionine-incorporated Proteins—Both VP4 plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli Tuner (DE3) cells for overexpression of the VP4 proteases. An overnight culture in M9 minimal media (10 ml) was used to inoculate 1 liter of M9 minimal media. All growth media were supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin for selection. Cultures were grown for 8 h at 37°C with shaking, and a mixture of the following l-amino acids was added directly: 100 mg of lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine; 50 mg of isoleucine, leucine, and valine; 60 mg of selenomethionine. After 15 min, the protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown for another 3 h and then harvested by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 15 min. The harvested cell pellets were frozen and then lysed by resuspending the frozen pellet in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 unit/ml benzonase, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubating overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to remove cell debris and obtain a clear supernatant. The clear supernatant was then subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation at 30, 40, 50, and 60% (w/v) ammonium sulfate concentrations. The ammonium sulfate precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and then dissolved in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The fractions containing VP4 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. The dialyzed protein was then applied to a Q-Sepharose FF anion-exchange column (2 ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with 2 ml of buffer A, the protein was eluted with a stepwise NaCl gradient (0.1 m increments up to 0.5 m) in buffer A. The ion-exchange elution fractions containing the VP4 were pooled and subjected to gel-filtration chromatography using a Hiprep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column equilibrated in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The column was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 3-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing the pure VP4 were then pooled and concentrated using a Millipore centrifugal filter (5000-Da MW cut-off). The proteins VP4tri and VP4hex were concentrated to 50 and 30 mg/ml, respectively, for crystallization. Crystallization—The crystals used for data collection were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization drops were prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein with 1 μl of reservoir solution and then equilibrating the drop against 1 ml of reservoir solution. The VP4tri protein produced triclinic crystals (P1) with unit cell dimensions of 41.7 × 69.3 × 191.4 Å (α = 93.1°, β = 95.0°, γ = 97.6°) with 10 molecules in the asymmetric unit and a Matthews coefficient of 2.5 Å3 Da–1 (51.3% solvent). The VP4hex protein produced hexagonal crystals (P6122) with unit cell dimensions of 77.1 × 77.1 × 136.4 Å with 1 molecule in the asymmetric unit and a Matthews coefficient of 2.9 Å3 Da–1 (57.3% solvent). For the triclinic crystals, the optimized crystallization reservoir condition was 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 35% PEG 4000, 0.4 m Li2SO4, 0.4 m guanidine-HCl. The crystallization was conducted at 4 °C. The cryosolvent condition was 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 35% PEG 4000, 0.45 m guanidine-HCl, 10% glycerol. For the hexagonal crystals, the optimized crystallization reservoir condition was 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 22% PEG 2000 MME, 0.45 m calcium acetate. The crystallization was conducted at 18 °C. The cryosolvent condition was 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 22.5% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.3 m calcium acetate, 15% glycerol. Both crystals were incubated under their respective cryosolvent conditions for ∼20 min before being flash-cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection—Diffraction data were collected on selenomethionine-incorporated crystals at beamline X8C of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Synchrotron Light Source, using a Q4 CCD detector and a Nonius CAD4 Goniometer. The crystal-to-detector distance was 200 mm for the P1 crystal and 175 mm for the P6122 crystal. Data were collected with 1° oscillations, and each image was exposed for 30 s with the hexagonal crystal and 3 s for the triclinic crystals. The P6122 crystal diffraction data were processed with the program HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar), and the P1 crystal diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G.W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The hexagonal crystal form (VP4hex) was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) using a data set collected at the peak wavelength (0.9792 Å) and the program autoSHARP (26Vonrhein C.

The program SOLOMON (27Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) was used to perform density modification. The program Arp/Warp (28Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) automatically built ∼70% of the polypeptide chain.

Overall Protein Architecture—The final refined structure of the hexagonal crystal form of IPNV VP4 (VP4hex) shows electron density for all residues except for those in a disordered loop region between β-strands β2 and β3 (Val549–Glu555) as well as the last three residues at the C terminus (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the refined structure for the triclinic crystal form of IPNV VP4 (VP4tri) displays electron density for all residues including those in the disordered loop region missing in VP4hex (Fig. 2B). The core of the two structures are very similar and can be superposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.65 Å over 180 aligned residues (residues 524–548 and 556–710). IPNV VP4 protease has an α/β protein fold that is composed of 13 β-strands (β1–β13) and four α-helices (α1–α4) as well as two 310-helices (η1 and η2) (Figs. 2 and 3). Seven β-strands (β1–β7) assemble into a mixed, but mostly anti-parallel, twisted β-sheet that provides the scaffold for the substrate binding site. Three α-helices (α2, α3, α4) pack against a parallel β-sheet composed of three strands (β8, β11, β12), and the remaining two strands (β9–β10) form a short β-hairpin. The nucleophile Ser633 resides just before α-helix 2 (α2) and the general base Lys674 (which has been mutated to an alanine in these structures) is part of α-helix 3 (α3).FIGURE 3A structure based sequence alignment of birnavirus VP4 proteases. The VP4 sequences for IPNV (P90205), BSNV (Q8AZM0), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV; P15480), and Drosophila X virus (DXV; Q96724) were obtained from the Swiss-Prot data bank (the corresponding accession numbers are in parentheses). The N and C termini of the VP4 sequences are defined by the pVP2/VP4 cleavage site and the VP4/VP3 cleavage site, respectively (see Fig. 1). The secondary structural elements of IPNV (blue) and BSNV (red) are shown aligned to their respective sequences. The secondary structural elements are numbered sequentially and are consistent with the ribbon diagrams shown in Fig. 2. The residues found in the catalytic site are denoted by stars: nucleophile Ser633, red star; general base Lys674, blue star; Pro544 and Thr655, black stars. The residues that flank the substrate binding site and contribute main-chain hydrogen bonding interactions with the substrate are denoted by triangles. Residues identically conserved or similar in all four birnavirus sequences are highlighted in red and yellow, respectively.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W1997798215,"The best way to prevent diseases caused by pathogens is by the use of vaccines. The advent of genomics enables genome-wide searches of new vaccine candidates, called reverse vaccinology. The most common strategy to apply reverse vaccinology is by designing subunit recombinant vaccines, which usually generate an humoral immune response due to B-cell epitopes in proteins. A major problem for this strategy is the identification of protective immunogenic proteins from the surfome of the pathogen. Epitope mimicry may lead to auto-immune phenomena related to several human diseases. A sequence-based computational analysis has been carried out applying the BLASTP algorithm. Therefore, two huge databases have been created, one with the most complete and current linear B-cell epitopes, and the other one with the surface-protein sequences of the main human respiratory bacterial pathogens. We found that none of the 7353 linear B-cell epitopes analysed shares any sequence identity region with human proteins capable of generating antibodies, and that only 1% of the 2175 exposed proteins analysed contain a stretch of shared sequence with the human proteome. These findings suggest the existence of a mechanism to avoid autoimmunity. We also propose a strategy for corroborating or warning about the viability of a protein linear B-cell epitope as a putative vaccine candidate in a reverse vaccinology study; so, epitopes without any sequence identity with human proteins should be very good vaccine candidates, and the other way around."
https://openalex.org/W2071050086,"Kidney anion exchanger 1 (kAE1) mediates chloride/bicarbonate exchange at the basolateral membrane of kidney α-intercalated cells, thereby facilitating bicarbonate reabsorption into the blood. Human kAE1 lacks the N-terminal 65 residues of the erythroid form (AE1, band 3), which are essential for binding of cytoskeletal and cytosolic proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a serine/threonine kinase, and an actin-binding protein as an interacting partner with the N-terminal domain of kAE1. Interaction between kAE1 and ILK was confirmed in co-expression experiments in HEK 293 cells and is mediated by a previously unidentified calponin homology domain in the kAE1 N-terminal region. The calponin homology domain of kAE1 binds the C-terminal catalytic domain of ILK to enhance association of kAE1 with the actin cytoskeleton. Overexpression of ILK increased kAE1 levels at the cell surface as shown by flow cytometry, cell surface biotinylation, and anion transport activity assays. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that ILK associates with kAE1 early in biosynthesis, likely in the endoplasmic reticulum. ILK co-localized with kAE1 at the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and in α-intercalated cells of human kidneys. Taken together these results suggest that ILK and kAE1 traffic together from the endoplasmic reticulum to the basolateral membrane. ILK may provide a linkage between kAE1 and the underlying actin cytoskeleton to stabilize kAE1 at the basolateral membrane, resulting in higher levels of cell surface expression."
https://openalex.org/W2062057057,"The regulation of gene expression in a cell relies to a major extent on transcription factors, proteins which recognize and bind the DNA at specific binding sites (response elements) within promoter regions associated with each gene. We present an information theoretic approach to modeling transcriptional regulatory networks, in terms of a simple ""sequence-matching"" rule and the statistics of the occurrence of binding sequences of given specificity in random promoter regions. The crucial biological input is the distribution of the amount of information coded in these cognate response elements and the length distribution of the promoter regions. We provide an analysis of the transcriptional regulatory network of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which we extract from the available databases, with respect to the degree distributions, clustering coefficient, degree correlations, rich-club coefficient and the k-core structure. We find that these topological features are in remarkable agreement with those predicted by our model, on the basis of the amount of information coded in the interaction between the transcription factors and response elements."
https://openalex.org/W2023561172,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, which accounts for approximately 75% of all diabetes-related deaths. Here we investigate the link between diabetes and macrophage cholesteryl ester accumulation. When diabetic (db/db) mice are given cholesteryl ester intraperitoneally (IP), peritoneal macrophages (PerMΦs) recovered from these animals showed a 58% increase in intracellular cholesteryl ester accumulation over PerMΦs from heterozygote control (db/+) mice. Notably, PerMΦ fluid-phase endocytosis and large particle phagocytosis was equivalent in db/+and db/db mice. However, IP administration of CD36 and SR-A blocking antibodies led to 37% and 25% reductions in cholesteryl ester accumulation in PerMΦ. Finally, in order to determine if these scavenger receptors (SRs) were part of the mechanism responsible for the increased accumulation of cholesteryl esters observed in the diabetic mouse macrophages, receptor expression was quantified by flow cytometry. Importantly, db/db PerMΦs showed a 43% increase in CD36 expression and an 80% increase in SR-A expression. Taken together, these data indicate that direct cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse macrophages is mediated by CD36 and SR-A, and the magnitude of accumulation is increased in db/db macrophages due to increased scavenger receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W2064752900,"Collagen IX, located on the surface of collagen fibrils, is crucial for cartilage integrity and stability. The N-terminal NC4 domain of the α1(IX) chain is probably important in this because it interacts with various macromolecules such as proteoglycans and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. At least 17 distinct collagen polypeptides carry an NC4-like unit near their N terminus, but this report, describing the crystal structure of NC4 at 1.8-Å resolution, represents the first atomic level structure for these domains. The structure is similar to previously characterized laminin-neurexin-sex hormone binding globulin (LNS) structures, dominated by an antiparallel β-sheet sandwich. In addition, a zinc ion was found in a position similar to that of the metal binding site of other LNS domains. A partial backbone NMR assignment of NC4 was obtained and utilized in NMR titration studies to investigate the zinc binding in solution state and to quantitate the affinity of metal binding. The Kd of 11.5 mm suggests a regulatory rather than a structural role for zinc in solution. NMR titration with a heparin tetrasaccharide revealed the presence of a secondary binding site for heparin on NC4, showing structural and functional conservation with thrombospondin-1, but a markedly reduced affinity for the ligand. Also the overall arrangement of the N and C termini of NC4 resembles most closely the N-terminal domain of thrombospondin-1, distinguishing the two from the majority of the published LNS structures.

Collagens are a family of extracellular matrix proteins comprised of at least 28 distinct types, all characterized by the presence of one or more elongated triple helical regions. This common motif is supplemented with a variety of non-helical domains to add unique properties for molecular or supramolecular assembly, for tissue-specific targeting, or for interactions with other constituents of the matrix (1Myllyharju J.

One of the TSPNs found in collagen chains is the NC4 domain of collagen IX, formed by about 245 N-terminal residues of the mature α1(IX) polypeptide. In cartilage tissue, collagen IX molecules are covalently bound to the heteropolymeric collagen fibrils that provide the tissue with high tensile strength to resist the swelling pressure caused by proteoglycans. The shorter arm of the triple helix of collagen IX projects away from the fibril body so that the NC4 domain can easily interact with other macromolecules.

In the course of evolution, the common LNS structure has been utilized in docking surfaces for various ligands such as glycosaminoglycans, simple carbohydrates, cell surface receptors, and other constituents of the extracellular matrix. In many LNS domains, the interactions appear to cluster to a specific area on the rim of the β-sandwich. In most published LNS structures a divalent cation of apparent functional importance is also located in the same region, whereas in lectins, the binding sites for both the ligands and the cation affecting ligand binding are located on the concave β-sheet (31Timpl R.

Instead of ammonium sulfate precipitation, the clarified cell lysate was subjected directly to affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) using Factor Xa protease (GE Healthcare) digestion to elute the NC4. After heparin affinity and cation exchange chromatography steps, the sample was further polished by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare), dialyzed into water, and lyophilized. In vitro mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to create a mutant form of NC4, termed NC4Ndel, lacking the first 17 residues of the mature polypeptide and replacing, for technical reasons, Asn18 and Glu19 with Asp and Leu, respectively. We also separately made the D190A/D192A double mutant. CD spectropolarimetry and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy were used to verify that the mutations did not cause abnormal folding of NC4. Selenomethionine incorporation was achieved by inoculating the Escherichia coli Rosetta™(DE3) cells (Novagen) into LB broth and growing at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of about 0.7. l-Selenomethionine was then added to 60 μg/ml, expression was induced after 10 min with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were harvested after a 4-h culture at 37 °C. Incorporation of the stable isotopes 15N and 13C for NMR studies was achieved by growing the BL21(DE3) cells to induction cell density in LB broth, collecting the cells by centrifugation, washing by brief resuspension in 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with the antibiotic, recollecting the cells, and finally resuspending in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/liter [15N]NH4Cl and 2 g/liter d-glucose or d-[13C]glucose. After shaking for 15 min at 37 °C, the induction was carried out as above. For perdeuteration, the M9 medium was prepared in 99% D2O. The incorporation of isotopic labels was verified by mass spectrometry using an Ultraflex TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Bremen, Germany) in a positive ion linear mode using sinapinic acid as a matrix. The instrument was externally calibrated. Crystallography—Crystals of NC4 were grown in sitting drops over a reservoir solution of 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm ZnSO4, and 20% monomethyl ether-polyethylene glycol 550. The drops were prepared by mixing 2 μl of the reservoir solution and 2 μl of the protein solution at 20 mg/ml. The crystals belong to space group I4 (a, b = 81.88 Å, c = 71.43 Å) with one molecule per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 44%. For data collection at –180 °C, crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen with the well solution containing 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data on a frozen selenomethionine derivative crystal were collected to 1.8 Å using the BM14U beamline at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at three wavelengths (Table 1). The data sets were indexed and scaled with the program X-ray Detector Software (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3217) Google Scholar). The Crystallography NMR software (Ref. 34Bruönger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

A fourth, strong anomalous scatterer was found, showing an increasing signal from the remote to the selenium K edge inflection point wavelength (0.9797 Å). The scatterer was initially assigned as a Zn2+ ion due to its presence in the crystallization buffer and the fact that it has the K absorption edge at 1.283 Å. The selenium sites together with the Zn2+ were used to estimate the experimental MAD phases at 2.0 Å in Crystallography NMR software (Table 1). The electron density map obtained upon solvent flipping in Crystallography NMR software was used for initial model building.TABLE 1Summary of X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionλpeakλremoteλinflection pointWavelength (Å)0.97960.88560.9797Resolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.20-1.8 (1.9-1.8)20-1.8 (1.9-1.8)20-1.8 (1.9-1.8)Number of reflectionsTotal164,652165,303164,402Unique21,92021,92021,918Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.99.9 (100.0)99.9 (100.0)99.9 (100.0)I/σaValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.18.3 (4.1)19.5 (4.4)20.5 (5.1)Rsym (%)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.5.6 (43.5)5.3 (40.0)4.9 (33.5)Number of selenium sites333Overall figure of merit for MAD phasing at 2.0-Å resolutionAcentric0.48Centric0.49Refinementλinflection pointResolution range (Å)20-1.8Reflections21,918Rwork (%)18.8Rfree (%)bThe Rfree was calculated with 5% of the data omitted from structure refinement.21.4Number of atomsProtein1,582Zn2+1Solvent235Average B-factor (Å2)Protein atoms28.6Zn2+25.8Solvent atoms44.0r.m.s.cRoot mean square. deviation from ideal valuesBond lengths (Å)0.007Angles (°)1.5a Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.b The Rfree was calculated with 5% of the data omitted from structure refinement.c Root mean square.

Using the inflection point data, this model was subjected to iterative rounds of refinement in Crystallography NMR software (34Bruönger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Refinement was carried out using energy minimization, simulated annealing, and individual temperature factor (B-factor) refinement. Water molecules were added to peaks above 3.5σ in the Fo – Fc difference map if they had suitable hydrogen bonding geometry. The final model, with good stereochemistry (Table 1), consists of 210 residues of which nine side chains display alternative conformations. In addition to the Zn2+, the solvent model includes a sulfate ion, four ethylene glycol, and 209 water molecules. Residues 1–18, 25–29, and 234–245 are not seen in the electron density. PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to assign secondary structure elements and calculate the Ramachandran plot. Of all the non-Gly/non-Pro residues, 86.1% have main chain torsion angles in the most favored regions, and there are no residues in the disallowed regions. Structural comparisons were carried out using DALI (37Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 223: 123-138Crossref Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—For the backbone chemical shift assignment of NC4, HNCACB and HN(CO)CACB spectra were acquired at 40 °C on a Varian Unity INOVA spectrometer operating at 600-MHz 1H frequency and equipped with a cryogenically cooled probe head and an actively shielded z-gradient system. The sample contained ∼0.5 mm 13C, 15N-labeled NC4 in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6.5 at 40 °C, 92.5% H2O, 7.5% D2O. Spectra were processed with Vnmr 6.1 revision C (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed with Sparky 3.106 (38Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky 3. 2002; (, University of California, San Francisco)Google Scholar). To obtain apo-[15N]NC4, the NMR sample was washed free of divalent cations in the presence of 2 m NaCl and 100 mm EDTA on a spinnable concentrator (Millipore) by concentrating 10-fold followed by a similar wash without added EDTA. Additional washing steps with 20 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6.5, were carried out until the calculated concentration of EDTA was 20 μm or less. This procedure gave a two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectrum identical to that from the size exclusion-based method that we adapted from the procedure used for removal of Ca2+ from calerythrin (39Aitio H. Laakso T. Pihlajamaa T. Torkkeli M. Kilpelaöinen I. Drakenberg T. Serimaa R. Annila A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For NMR titration with divalent cations as ligands, a Varian Unity INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded z-axis gradient probe head was used to measure a series of two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra for apo-[15N]NC4 in the absence or presence of cations. For the Zn2+ titration, a series of spectra was recorded in which the concentration of ZnCl2 was gradually increased. Concentrations corresponding to molar ratios of 0:1, 1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, 40:1, 60:1, and 80:1 of Zn2+ to NC4 were used, and a 1H, 15N HSQC spectrum was acquired at each titration point. Average chemical shift changes were calculated with equation Δδ = [(δHN)2 + 0.17 × (δNH)2]1/2 for five residues that could be traced with the highest confidence in the Zn2+ titration spectra. These values were plotted as a function of Zn2+ concentration, and curve fitting with nonlinear regression (40Tossavainen H. Pihlajamaa T. Huttunen T.K. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Permi P. Kilpelaöinen I. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1760-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was performed to obtain dissociation constants for the individual binding curves. To monitor the interaction of Ca2+ and Mg2+ with NC4, spectra were measured in the presence of a single cation concentration, corresponding to a molar ratio of 25:1 of the cation to NC4. The titration spectra with heparin oligosaccharides were acquired at 600-MHz 1H frequency (40Tossavainen H. Pihlajamaa T. Huttunen T.K. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Permi P. Kilpelaöinen I. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1760-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in 33 mm NaCl, 20 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6.5 at 40 °C, 92.5% H2O, 7.5% D2O. For titration with the heparin tetrasaccharide (Dextra Laboratories, Reading, UK) concentration ratios of 0:1, 3:1, 6:1, 15:1, 24:1, and 36:1 were used, and an averaged dissociation constant was determined as above using data from five residues. To investigate the interaction of naturally occurring retinoids with NC4, solid all-trans-retinoic acid or vitamin D3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated for at least 24 h with [15N]NC4 at 20 °C in the presence of Zn2+ or EDTA (41Guo Y. Bozic D. Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Engel J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5265-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Insoluble retinoid was removed by centrifugation, and a two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectrum was measured as above. Alternatively concentrated stock solution of retinoid prepared in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide was added in excess to a [15N]NC4 NMR sample, keeping the amount of Me2SO below 1%, and a two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectrum was measured (42Krishnan V.V. Sukumar M. Gierasch L.M. Cosman M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9119-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—The three-dimensional crystal structure of NC4 was solved by collecting MAD data from a crystal of selenomethionine-substituted protein. In addition to the three expected selenium sites, a Zn2+ cation was found and used in phasing. The asymmetric unit encompasses a single NC4 domain. The model was refined at 1.8-Å resolution to a crystallographic R factor of 18.8% and an Rfree of 21.4%. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Analysis using PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows that all non-glycine and non-proline residues are in the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Except for residues 1–18, 25–29, and 234–245, the main chain is well defined by the electron density. Structure of NC4—The NC4 structure has a globular lectin-like architecture and contains 14 β-strands, four small α-helices, and two 310 helix-like turns (Fig. 1). The most prominent feature is two antiparallel six-stranded β-sheets sandwiched together. The first β-sheet is composed of strands β1, β5, β10, β11, β12, and β14, and the solvent-exposed face is convex (the convex sheet). The second β-sheet, approximately parallel with the first one, correspondingly has a concave solvent-exposed face (the concave sheet) and is composed of antiparallel strands β4, β6, β7, β8, β9, and β13. The loops connecting β6 to β7 and β13 to β14 rise up and form a depression that is orthogonal to the direction of the strands and runs the length of the sheet (Fig. 1). Although the C-terminal portion of the structure is covered by the lectin-like β-sandwich with relatively short connecting loops, the N-terminal part possesses larger excursions. The first β-strand, on the convex side, is preceded by 32 residues, including Cys21 that forms a disulfide bridge with Cys219 at the end of β14. Despite this linkage to the rest of the structure, only the residues immediately adjacent to Cys21 (residues 19–24) are visible in the electron density of the first 29 residues (Fig. 1B). The first β-strand is followed by a long insertion bearing two short α-helices, α1 and α2, and a β-hairpin loop (strands β2 and β3). The insertion closes one edge of the β-sandwich (Fig. 1A). From here, the chain continues to the other β-sheet, contributing a short strand, β4, that is directly followed by the third α-helix, α3. The last α-helix, α4, is part of the connecting loop between strands β5 and β6. Following the last strand, β14, there is a C-terminal extension of 15 residues (residues 219–233) on the convex side. In addition to Cys219, Cys229 also forms a disulfide bridge (Cys175-Cys229) in this area and links the C terminus to the convex sheet. A strong anomalous scatterer was found when the MAD phases were estimated. The anomalous signal (Fig. 2) for this scatterer was highest in the selenium K edge inflection point data set, and because 10 mm ZnSO4 was required for crystallization, we assigned the anomalous scatterer as Zn2+. Crystals could not be obtained in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. The Zn2+ binding site is located on an edge of the β-sandwich (Fig. 1) and is formed by the β6–β7 and β12–β13 lo"

The TAF N-terminal domain (TAND) of yeast TAF1 containing two subdomains, TAND1 (residues 10-37) and TAND2 (residues 46-71), is sufficient to interact with TBP and suppress the TATA binding activity of TBP. However, the detailed structural analysis of the complex between yeast TBP and TAND12 (residues 6-71) was hindered by its poor solubility and stability in solution. Here we report a molecular engineering approach where the N terminus of TBP is fused to the C terminus of TAND12 via linkers of various lengths containing (GGGS)n sequence, (n = 1, 2, 3). The length of the linker within the TAND12-TBP fusion has a significant effect on solubility and stability (SAS). The construct with (GGGS)3 linker produces the best quality single-quantum-coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum with markedly improved SAS. In parallel to these observations, the TAND12-TBP fusion exhibits marked reduction of TBP function in binding to TAF1 as well as temperature sensitivity in in vivo yeast cell growth. Remarkably, the temperature sensitivity was proportional to the length of the linker in the fusions: the construct with (GGGS)3 linker did not grow at 20 °C, while those with (GGGS)1 and (GGGS)2 linkers did. These results together indicate that the native interaction between TBP and TAND12 is well maintained in the TAND12-(GGGS)3-TBP fusion and that this fusion approach provides an excellent model system to investigate the structural detail of the TBP-TAF1 interaction.

In many promoters including the oncogene cyclin D1, the TATA element is absent and TAFs may be more actively involved in the recruitment of TFIID to promoter sequences (11Hilton T.L. Wang E.H. J.

Wright P.E. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). These unstructured proteins or domains often undergo coupled or synergistic folding upon interaction with binding/functional partners (19Liu D. Ishima R. Tong K.I. Bagby S. Kokubo T. Muhandiram D.R.

The primary sequence of the TAND region is poorly conserved between yeast and Drosophila (14Kotani T. Miyake T. Tsukihashi Y. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. J. Biol.

Drosophila (d)TAND1 (residues 11-77) can form a stable complex with TBP, while yeast (y)TAND requires both subdomains TAND1 (residues 10-37) and TAND2 residues (46Takahata S. Kasahara K. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar-71), and yTAND1 is much shorter in polypeptide length compared with dTAND1 (13Kokubo T. Swanson M.J.

To understand the structure function relationship of these evolutionarily diverse TAND domains in TAF1, we previously attempted detailed structural studies by NMR, but had limited success because of the poor stability and solubility (SAS) of the yTBP and yTAND12 complex (20Mal T.K. Masutomi Y. Zheng L. Nakata Y. Ohta H. Nakatani Y. Kokubo T. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SAS is the major obstacle for structural studies of many proteins and of their complexes in solution NMR. Structure determination by solution NMR typically requires a protein concentration of 200 μm or greater for several days in solution. Buffer screening and point mutations have been useful to improve for the long term protein SAS in some cases (30Lepre C.A. Moore J.M. J. Biomol.

In addition, truncation or addition of a few residues at the C and N termini of the protein construct can improve SAS (26Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R.

In the past, the fusion of domains has also been used for enhancing expression, SAS of proteins, as well as for studying protein-protein interactions. Wagner and co-workers (35Zhou P. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have introduced a solubility-enhanced tag (SET) fused to a near insoluble protein causing solubility enhancement. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused to the C terminus of a target protein has been used as an indicator to screen for protein folding during overexpression in mico-organisms (36Waldo G.S. Standish B.M. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins have been engineered for expression of recombinant production of immunoglobin fragments for immunological and crystallographic studies using a variety of linkers (37Huston J.S.

Detailed biophysical and biochemical properties were also explored for engineered fusion proteins, for example calmodulin (CaM) fused to M13, the CaM binding region of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase through a glycylglycine or a GGGGS pentapeptide linker (44Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Brown S.E. Porumb T. Zhang M. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3508-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45Porumb T. Yau P. Harvey T.S. Ikura M. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we employ a fusion approach in which the N terminus of TBP is fused with the C terminus of TAND12 via linkers (GGGS)n of various lengths to explore whether TAND12 can regulate the function of TBP, and to facilitate NMR studies of the protein complex (Fig. 1). Our recent studies suggest that TAND of TAF1 is an autonomous regulator of TBP function (46Takahata S. Kasahara K. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). TAND can interact with and regulate TBP function when it is fused to either termini of any TFIID subunit. We have engineered an active fusion strategy where a linker is used to tether two interacting proteins to enhance protein-protein interaction and to improve the SAS of the complex. Three fusion constructs were made with various linker lengths and among these constructs, the fusion protein containing a (GGGS)3 linker exhibited the greatest enhancement of SAS compared with the intermolecular complex between TBP and TAND12 (Fig. 1). The NMR data suggests that the TAND12 and TBP within the fusion protein, TAND12-(GGGS)3-TBP form a stable intramolecular complex that mimics the native and specific interactions observed for the intermolecular complex between TBP and TAND12. The fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) and yeast in vivo growth data also support this observation. Plasmid Construction—pM1775 was created by disrupting the NdeI site of pM888 (TAF1/pRS314) (47Kasahara K. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange) using the TK56 oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. pM4139 encoding the TAND-TBP fusion protein was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment encoding TAND (residues 8-139) was amplified by PCR with the TK4402 and TK4403 primer pair using pM1775 as a template and then inserted into the NdeI site of pM1578 (TBP/pET28a) (48Kobayashi A.

For the FRET experiments with YFP-TBP and GST-CFP-TAND12, pM3097 (YFP-TBP/pET28a) was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment encoding YFP into the NdeI site of pM1578, which resulted in the expression of protein having YFP fused to the N terminus of TBP. The DNA fragment encoding YFP was amplified by PCR with the TK1795 and TK1796 primer pair using pRSETb-EYFP (49Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y.

Protein Expression and Purification—The protocol for obtaining Saccharomyces cerevisiae TAF1 (yTAND12) and TBP (yTBP) proteins have been described elsewhere (20Mal T.K. Masutomi Y. Zheng L. Nakata Y. Ohta H. Nakatani Y. Kokubo T. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, TAND12 was expressed with a GST affinity tag while TBP was His6-tagged. These proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and Ni-NTA affinity columns, respectively. They were further purified by size exclusion gel filtration column using Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare). Two samples for the TBP-TAND12 complex were prepared, each with one component being uniformly 15N labeled. Three fusion constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) codon plus (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 1.0 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 15 °C overnight. The His-tagged proteins were lysed by sonication and bound to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) in buffer-1 containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). After washing with five column volumes with buffer-2 (buffer 1 with 20 mm imidazole), the bound proteins were cut from Ni-NTA beads by overnight treatment with thrombin in the same buffer at 4 °C. After thrombin cleavage, the fusion proteins were passed through an ion exchange using a Hi Trap column (GE Healthcare) employing a linear salt gradient of buffer-3 (50 mm glycine pH 9.0, 5% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and buffer-4 (Buffer 3 + 1 m KCl) and were eluted at a salt concentration of 150 mm KCl. They were further purified by using a Superdex 75 size exclusion column in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at pH 7.0. The yield of these fusion constructs were as follows: TAND12-(GGGS)1-TBP, 6 mg/liter; TAND12-(GGGS)2-TBP, 8 mg/liter, and TAND12-(GGGS)3-TBP, 9 mg/liter. Isotope-labeled protein samples were obtained by bacterial expression in modified minimal M9 medium supplemented with 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride as sole source of 15N and/or 2 g/liter d-[13C]glucose and 100% 2H2O. The plasmids encoding the GST-CFP-TAND12 fusion protein (pM3510) or its TAND12 mutant derivative (pM7432) were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C until A600 0.6 and then expression was induced by adding IPTG to 0.5 mm. After 3 more hours of incubation at the same temperature the cells were lysed by sonication, and the GST-tagged protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose in buffer 5 containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After extensive washing with buffer 5, the bound proteins were eluted with buffer 6 (buffer 5 with 10 mm glutathione) and dialyzed against buffer-7 containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 12.5 mm MgCl2 for the FRET experiments. The plasmid encoding the YFP-TBP fusion protein (pM3097) was transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 30 °C until A600 0.6 and then expression was induced by adding IPTG to 0.5 mm. After 3 more hours of incubation at the same temperature, the cells were lysed by sonication, and the His-tagged protein was bound to Ni-NTA agarose in buffer 8 containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm imid"
https://openalex.org/W1970381795,"The intracellular concentration of protein may be as high as 400 mg per ml; thus it seems inevitable that within the cell, numerous protein-protein contacts are constantly occurring. A basic biochemical principle states that the equilibrium of an association reaction can be shifted by ligand binding. This indicates that if within the cell many protein-protein interactions are indeed taking place, some fundamental characteristics of proteins would necessarily differ from those observed in traditional biochemical systems. Accordingly, we measured the effect of eight different proteins on the formation of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) from guanidinium chloride unfolded monomers. The eight proteins at concentrations of micrograms per ml induced an important increase on active dimer formation. Studies on the mechanism of this phenomenon showed that the proteins stabilize the dimeric structure of TbTIM, and that this is the driving force that promotes the formation of active dimers. Similar data were obtained with TIM from three other species. The heat changes that occur when TbTIM is mixed with lysozyme were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry; the results provided direct evidence of the weak interaction between apparently unrelated proteins. The data, therefore, are strongly suggestive that the numerous protein-protein interactions that occur in the intracellular space are an additional control factor in the formation and stability of proteins."
