https://openalex.org/W2094357941,"THE biochemical tests usually used in classifying mycobacteria are based mainly on quantitative differences in enzyme activities, with the exception of the niacin test. It would be important to examine the qualitative differences in enzyme activities such as substrate specificity and multiplicity of molecular forms. Esterases are thought to be the most suitable materials for this purpose because of their wide distribution in mycobacteria and the ease with which their zymogram can be obtained by electrophoresis. Cann et al.1 examined the esterase patterns of some groups of rapid growers and suggested that this technique could be applied to the classification of mycobacteria. The present communication describes the species (or group) specificities of esterase zymograms obtained from numbers of mycobacterial strains using an advanced technique of thin layer electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W2029549122,THE reversal of the pressor response to adrenaline after ergotoxine was first observed by Dale1 in cats. Reversal of the pressor effects of noradrenaline has also been observed after ergotoxine or ‘Dibenamine’2. Nickerson and Nomaguchi3 demonstrated that directly acting catecholamines and indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines such as hydroxyamphetamine or tyramine lowered the blood pressure of cats after blockade of α-receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1983596151,"THE presence of an antifungal factor has been reported in normal human serum and in the conjunctival mucosa1–3. This work was initiated to determine whether saliva possesses an identical or similar substance. Stimulated whole saliva, parotid and sub-maxillary secretions were collected from ten apparently normal individuals and tested by placing aliquots in cylinders on Pagano–Levin agar, lawn seeded with Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No zones of inhibition were observed. Serum constituents (globulins) excreted in saliva are approximately one tenth of their concentration in serum and so it was decided to concentrate the salivary specimens to dryness by lyophilization. The solid constituents were then resuspended in sterile distilled water to give final concentrations 2.5–20 times greater than in saliva. Such concentrations manifested anti-fungal properties when tested as previously described. No inhibitory activity was discernible when Sabouraud's glucose agar, blood brain heart infusion agar or brain heart infusion agar were used, and so it seemed that the constituent in the Pagano–Levin medium which might be responsible for this activity was triphenyltetrazolium chloride, a redox indicator. The compound is reduced by Candida tropicalis to a red pigmented crystalline formazan whereas strains of Candida albicans usually fail to do so. At least five times the concentration of tetrazolium salt in Pagano–Levin medium is necessary for inhibition."

Acidic and neutral low molecular weight serum proteins and peptides, however, have been known for many years2–4. In the present report the purification and partial characterization of one of the basic proteins, B2, are described."

Such a set can be induced by a bodily need such as hunger, or by verbal instructions. The present study investigates whether an instruction which an individual gives to himself has more effect on subsequent perception than an instruction which he receives from an external source. There were three independent groups of subjects."

https://openalex.org/W1976547649,"IT was recently reported in your pages that prenatal X-irradiation produces a higher incidence of congenital anomalies in the offspring of primiparous mice than in those of multiparous mice, and that although the difference is not great, it is “indeed significant”. In addition to gross external malformations, the classification “congenital anomaly” was also assigned by the writers to resorbed conceptuses, dead foetuses, and stunted survivors, although there is no justification for this practice, because these disparate phenomena may result from unlike effects of irradiation. Thus, collecting them together under one heading probably obscures rather than clarifies the nature of the damage done by prenatal irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2051592107,"DURING the course of an investigation involving the transforming ability of pneumococcal DNA, an interesting correlation was found between the transforming activity of lysates prepared at varying times from the same culture and the number of viable organisms in the culture. Streptococcus pneumoniae, strain Aml, an aminopterin resistant strain derived from strain R36A of Avery et al.1, was grown first in P medium and then in NS medium in the manner designed to promote competence2. At appropriate times, 1.0 ml. aliquots of the culture in NS medium were lysed in the presence of sodium citrate by the addition of sodium deoxycholate, and the DNA was precipitated with ethyl alcohol using sodium hyaluronate as coprecipitant2. In one of the experiments to be discussed another aliquot was taken at the same time as that for the lysate, and, after suitable dilution, was plated out in triplicate for a viable count. The lysates were assayed for their transforming activity with respect to resistance to aminopterin by a conventional method2, using Str. pneumoniae strain Cl. 3 as the receptor organism."

https://openalex.org/W4246377304,"At the British Association meeting at Nottingham in September 1966, the Zoology section held a symposium on the regulating mechanism of living cells. Most often this seems to depend on the transfer of specific molecules from one place in the cell to another and from one cell to another. The survey which follows is partly based on the discussion at Nottingham."
