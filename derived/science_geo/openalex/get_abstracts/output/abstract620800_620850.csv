https://openalex.org/W2898582686,"Resveratrol shows potent anti-tumor therapeutic properties in various tumors. However, the exact effect of resveratrol on osteosarcoma cells, especially cancer stem cells, remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of resveratrol on osteosarcoma stem cells and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Resveratrol inhibited cell viability, self-renewal ability and tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma cells, whereas showed no significant inhibition effects to normal osteoblast cells. Mechanically, resveratrol treatment decreased cytokines synthesis and inhibited JAK2/STAT3 signaling, which was consistent with the decline of cancer stem cells marker, CD133. Exogenous STAT3 activation attenuated the cancer stem cell elimination effects of resveratrol treatment. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis ability, which was correlated with cytokines inhibition related JAK2/STAT3 signaling blockage. Resveratrol may be a promising therapeutic agent for osteosarcoma management."
https://openalex.org/W2898517770,"Microbial population in the gastrointestinal tract plays a central role in health and nutrient digestion. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationships between microbiota and apparent digestibility coefficients with respect to age and diet. Pigs from Large-White, Duroc or Pietrain breeds were raised under the same housing conditions and fed alternately a low-fiber (LF) and a high-fiber diet (HF) during 4 successive 3-week periods. Data collection for digestibility measurements was achieved during the last week of each period. At the end of each period, fecal microbiota was collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The microbiota remained stable across periods whereas digestibility of energy, crude proteins and cell wall components increased. The microbiota was resilient to diet effect and pigs fed the LF diet were discriminated to those fed the HF diet using 31 predicting OTUs with a mean classification error-rate of 3.9%. Clostridiaceae and Turicibacter were negatively correlated whereas Lactobacillus was positively correlated with protein and energy digestibility coefficients in the LF group. In addition, Lachnospiraceae and Prevotella were negatively correlated with cell wall component digestibility. In contrast, no significant correlation was found between microbiota composition and digestibility coefficients when pigs were fed the HF diet. Interestingly, it was also no longer possible to distinguish animals from different breeds once the animals were fed a HF diet, so that the microbiota could only trace the breed origin in the first period and in the LF group. In our experimental conditions, 3 weeks of adaptation to a new diet seems to be sufficient to observe resilience in growing pigs' microbiota. We demonstrated that fecal microbiota can be used to classify pigs according to their dietary treatment. Some bacteria are favorable or unfavorable to digestibility. This suggests that manipulations of bacterial populations can improve digestibility and feed efficiency."

Inclusion criteria were GHD, naïve to GH treatment, known TH, age <10y in girls and <12y in boys, ≥3 measurements, HSDS <-2 at start, complete data on growth and adherence in the first and second year. Linear regression analyses were performed to test the association between adherence (continuous and high vs. low) and the outcome measures, also adjusted for potential clinical confounders (age at start, adj-HSDS at start, birth weight SDS, gestational age (<37 weeks vs ≥37 weeks), GH dose, GH max (n = 58)). The formula of IoR already adjusts for confounders.In total, 95 patients complied with the inclusion criteria. The strongest associations were found between high adherence in the second year (≥91% as cut-off value) and IoR 2y (+0.62), and average adherence and high adherence (≥78%) in the first two years and ΔHSDS 0-2y (+0.11 SD per 1 injection/week, and +0.34 SD for high vs. low adherence).Suboptimal adherence negatively affected the growth response in the first two years of GH treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2898275793,"The objective of this study is to train and validate a multi-parameterized artificial neural network (ANN) based on personal health information to predict lung cancer risk with high sensitivity and specificity. The 1997-2015 National Health Interview Survey adult data was used to train and validate our ANN, with inputs: gender, age, BMI, diabetes, smoking status, emphysema, asthma, race, Hispanic ethnicity, hypertension, heart diseases, vigorous exercise habits, and history of stroke. We identified 648 cancer and 488,418 non-cancer cases. For the training set the sensitivity was 79.8% (95% CI, 75.9%-83.6%), specificity was 79.9% (79.8%-80.1%), and AUC was 0.86 (0.85-0.88). For the validation set sensitivity was 75.3% (68.9%-81.6%), specificity was 80.6% (80.3%-80.8%), and AUC was 0.86 (0.84-0.89). Our results indicate that the use of an ANN based on personal health information gives high specificity and modest sensitivity for lung cancer detection, offering a cost-effective and non-invasive clinical tool for risk stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2898340416,"Although higher physical activity (PA) levels are associated with better mental health, previous findings about the shape of the dose-response relationship between PA and mental health are inconsistent. Furthermore, this association may differ according to sedentary levels. We investigated the cross-sectional dose-response associations between objectively measured PA and mental health in a representative national sample of adults. We also examined whether sedentary time modified the PA-mental health associations. Based on 2007-2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey data, PA and sedentary time were measured using accelerometry among 8150 participants, aged 20 to 79 years. Generalized additive models with a smooth function were fitted to examine associations between minutes per day of moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA), daily steps (combined or not with sedentary time) and self-rated mental health. A significant curvilinear relationship between average daily minutes of MVPA and mental health was observed, with increasing benefits up to 50 minutes/day. For LPA, a more complex shape (monotonic and curvilinear) was found. For daily steps, inverted U-shaped curve suggested increasing benefits until a plateau between 5 000 and 16 000 steps. The MVPA-LPA combination was significantly associated with mental health but with a complex pattern (p < 0.0005E-06). The tested PA-sedentary time combinations showed that increasing sedentary time decreased the positive PA-mental health associations. Non-linear dose-response patterns between the PA modalities and self-reported mental health were observed. Optimal doses of daily minutes of MVPA, LPA, MVPA combined with LPA and daily steps are independently associated with better mental health in adults. The results also suggest that PA-mental health associations could be hampered by daily sedentary time."
https://openalex.org/W2898425686,"Predicting fish stock variations on interannual to decadal time scales is one of the major issues in fisheries science and management. Although the field of marine ecological predictions is still in its infancy, it is understood that a major source of multi-year predictability resides in the ocean. Here we show the first highly skilful long-term predictions of the commercially valuable Barents Sea cod stock. The 7-year predictions are based on the propagation of ocean temperature anomalies from the subpolar North Atlantic toward the Barents Sea, and the strong co-variability between these temperature anomalies and the cod stock. Retrospective predictions for the period 1957–2017 capture well multi-year to decadal variations in cod stock biomass, with cross-validated explained variance of over 60%. For lead times longer than one year the statistical long-term predictions show more skill than operational short-term predictions used in fisheries management and lagged persistence forecasts. Our results thus demonstrate the potential for ecosystem-based fisheries management, which could enable strategic planning on longer time scales. Future predictions show a gradual decline in the cod stock towards 2024."
https://openalex.org/W2898278143,"Skeletal muscle is considered a secretory organ that produces bioactive proteins known as myokines, which are released in response to various stimuli. However, no experimental evidence exists regarding the mechanism by which acute muscle contraction regulates myokine secretion. Here, we present evidence that acute contractions induced myokine secretion from C2C12 myotubes. Changes in the cell culture medium unexpectedly triggered the release of large amounts of proteins from the myotubes, and these proteins obscured the contraction-induced myokine secretion. Once protein release was abolished, the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), the best-known regulatory myokine, increased in response to a 1-hour contraction evoked by electrical stimulation. Using this experimental condition, intracellular calcium flux, rather than the contraction itself, triggered contraction-induced IL-6 secretion. This is the first report to show an evidence for acute contraction-induced myokine secretion by skeletal muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2898460625,"Multispectral LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data have been initially used for land cover classification. However, there are still high classification uncertainties, especially in urban areas, where objects are often mixed and confounded. This study investigated the efficiency of combining advanced statistical methods and LiDAR metrics derived from multispectral LiDAR data for improving land cover classification accuracy in urban areas. The study area is located in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, on the Lake Ontario shoreline. Multispectral Optech Titan LiDAR data over the study area were acquired on 3 September 2014 in a single strip of 3 km2. Using the channels at 1,550 nm (C1), 1,064 nm (C2) and 532 nm (C3), LiDAR intensity data, normalized digital surface model (nDSM), pseudo normalized difference vegetation index (PseudoNDVI), morphological profiles (MP), and a novel hierarchical morphological profiles (HMP) were derived and used as features for the classification. A support vector machine classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was applied in the classification stage, where the optimal parameters for the classifier were selected by a grid search procedure. The combination of intensity, pseudoNDVI, nDSM and HMP resulted in the best land cover classification, with an overall accuracy of 93.28%."
https://openalex.org/W2898284188,"Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health problem with some socially patterned drivers. The objective of the study was to investigate associations between use of and trust in the Internet as a source of health-related information and the public's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours regarding antibiotics.Two representative cross-sectional surveys (the 2015 Wellcome Monitor (n = 1524) and UK segment (n = 1330) of the 2016 Eurobarometer 85.1) covering knowledge about antibiotics and antibiotic consumption were analysed. Knowledge, attitude, and behaviour variables were analysed using regression in relation to demographic characteristics and use and trust in the Internet as a source of information.The key findings of the analysis are that both use of the Internet as a source of medical research information (variable from the Wellcome Monitor) and trust in the Internet as a source of information about antibiotics (variable from the Eurobarometer) were independently and positively associated with knowledge, attitude, and behaviour regarding antibiotics. Additionally, knowledge about antibiotics was positively associated with behaviour with antibiotics (Wellcome Monitor) and attitude towards finishing antibiotic prescriptions (Eurobarometer). Higher levels of education were associated with better knowledge about antibiotics in both datasets. Older age was positively associated with behaviour and attitude regarding antibiotic consumption.The Internet is a resource for disseminating quality health information that has the potential to improve stewardship of antibiotics in the community. This study suggests that members of the UK public that use the Internet as a source of health-related information are more likely to be better informed about, and be more responsible with, antibiotics. This mode of information dissemination should be capitalised on to improve antimicrobial stewardship, and further research should examine what the most effective online information sources are in the UK and to what extent their association with behaviour is causal."
https://openalex.org/W2898487768,"Background Food security is critical to achieving sustainable growth, poverty reduction, and political and economic stability. Livestock have the potential to improve the food security of smallholder households in developing countries, but livestock productivity is constrained by disease. The extent to which households adopt innovations such as vaccines impacts disease control; however, the behavioral and economic drivers underlying household decisions to adopt or forgo vaccination are not well understood. We address this gap with a study of adoption of Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines by chicken-owning households in Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered to 535 households owning indigenous chickens in Arusha, Singida, and Mbeya regions in Tanzania. We measured potential predictors of ND vaccine adoption including knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors correlated with three stages of household adoption: awareness of ND vaccines, previous vaccination, and recent vaccination (within four months) consistent with veterinary guidelines. Results Eighty percent of households were aware of ND vaccines, 57% had previously vaccinated, and 26% had recently vaccinated. Knowing someone who vaccinated increased the odds of a household previously vaccinating [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.32, 95% CI: 1.1–1.5]. Larger flock size was also associated with higher odds of previous vaccination (AOR: 1.03 for a one chicken increase, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05). Usage of traditional medicine decreased the odds of previously vaccination (AOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36–0.95). Conclusion Our findings suggest that encouraging the flow of professional-level knowledge within the community by vaccine adopters is a strategy to increase vaccine adoption. Enhancing local chicken productivity through increased vaccine coverage would strengthen a key smallholder household resource for food and economic security."
https://openalex.org/W2898307372,"There are two main types of hair follicle in Inner Mongolia Cashmere goats, the primary hair follicle (PHF) producing hair fibers and the secondary hair follicle (SHF) producing cashmere fibers. Of both fibers from cashmere-bearing goats in Aerbasi, Inner Mongolia, the timing of cyclical phases for the cashmere have been well clarified but hair fibers have been less noticeable. Herein, we evaluated transcriptome of PHF and SHF from the same three goats in Aerbasi at the catagen- and telogen phase of cashmere growth. We totally found 1977 DEGs between PHFs at the telogen and catagen phases of SHF, 1199 DEGs between telogen- and catagen SHF, 2629 DEGs between PHF at the catagen phase of SHF and catagen SHF, and 755 DEGs between PHF at the telogen phase of SHF and telogen SHF. By analyzing gene functions based on GO and KEGG database, we found that the DEGs have functions in muscle contraction and muscle filament sliding between catagen- and telogen SHF, indicating that arrector pilli muscles might play a role on the transition from catagen to telogen. Moreover, considering that the enriched GO and KEGG categories of the DEGs between PHF and SHF, we suggested that part of PHF might rest in their own anagen phase when SHF are at catagen, but PHF might enter into the telogen phase at SHF's telogen. Finally, we highly recommended the several potential genes acting as the regulators of the transition between growth phases including IL17RB and eight members of ZNF. These results provide insight into molecular mechanisms on the transition of SHF from catagen to telogen together with PHF's growth situation at SHF's catagen and telogen in Inner Mongolia Cashmere goats."
https://openalex.org/W2898163641,"Herein we present an innovative method of coating the surface of Titanium-Aluminium-Niobium bone scaffold implants with bacterial cellulose (BC) polymer saturated with antibiotic. Customized Ti6Al7Nb scaffolds manufactured using Selective Laser Melting were immersed in a suspension of Komagataeibacter xylinus bacteria which displays an ability to produce a 3-dimensional structure of bio-cellulose polymer. The process of complete implant coating with BC took on average 7 days. Subsequently, the BC matrix was cleansed by means of alkaline lysis and saturated with gentamycin. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that BC adheres and penetrates into the implant scaffold structure. The viability and development of the cellular layer on BC micro-structure were visualized by means of confocal microscopy. The BC-coated implants displayed a significantly lower cytotoxicity against osteoblast and fibroblast cell cultures in vitro in comparison to non-coated implants. It was also noted that gentamycin released from BC-coated implants inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus cultures in vitro, confirming the suitability of such implant modification for preventing hostile microbial colonization. As demonstrated using digital microscopy, the procedure used for implant coating and BC chemical cleansing did not flaw the biomaterial structure. The results presented herein are of high translational value with regard to future use of customized, BC-coated and antibiotic-saturated implants designed for use in orthopedic applications to speed up recovery and to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2898307895,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of circular double-stranded DNA viruses, showing severe tropism to mucosal tissues. A subset of HPVs, especially HPV16 and 18, are the primary etiological cause for several epithelial cell malignancies, causing about 5.2% of all cancers worldwide. Due to the high prevalence and mortality, HPV-associated cancers have remained as a significant health problem in human society, making an urgent need to develop an effective therapeutic vaccine against them. Achieving this goal is primarily dependent on the identification of efficient tumor-associated epitopes, inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response. Previous information has shown that E5, E6, and E7 early proteins are responsible for the induction and maintenance of HPV-associated cancers. Therefore, the prediction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I T cell epitopes of HPV16, 18, 31 and 45 oncoproteins was targeted in this study. For this purpose, a two-step plan was designed to identify the most probable CD8+ T cell epitopes. In the first step, MHC-I and II binding, MHC-I processing, MHC-I population coverage and MHC-I immunogenicity prediction analyses, and in the second step, MHC-I and II protein-peptide docking, epitope conservation, and cross-reactivity with host antigens’ analyses were carried out successively by different tools. Finally, we introduced five probable CD8+ T cell epitopes for each oncoprotein of the HPV genotypes (60 epitopes in total), which obtained better scores by an integrated approach. These predicted epitopes are valuable candidates for in vitro or in vivo therapeutic vaccine studies against the HPV-associated cancers. Additionally, this two-step plan that each step includes several analyses to find appropriate epitopes provides a rational basis for DNA- or peptide-based vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2898574977,"Hypoxia induces myocardial injury through the activation of inflammatory and oxidative processes. The pivotal role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases has been firmly established in clinical trials and practice; in fact many experimental and clinical data have highlighted that its inhibition has a cardioprotective role. Activated RAS also stimulates inflammation directly inducing proinflammatory and oxidative gene expression. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of a pre-treatment (10 and 100 μM) with irbesartan on injury induced by 24 h of hypoxia in HL-1 cardiomyocytes; in particular, we have analyzed the natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression, a biomarker able to modulate inflammatory reaction to cardiac injury and some markers involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. Our results demonstrated that a pre-treatment with 100 μM irbesartan significantly increased SOD activity and catalase expression of 15 and 25%, respectively, compared to hypoxic cells (P<0.05). On the other hand, it was able to reduce the release of peroxynitrite and iNOS protein expression of 20 and 50% respectively (P<0.05). In addition irbesartan exerts an anti-inflammatory activity reducing Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-2 and -4 mRNA expression, TNF-alpha expression and activity (20%) and increasing the expression of the cytokine IL-17 (40%) (P<0.05 vs hypoxia). Our findings also showed that BNP induced by ischemia was significantly and in a concentration-dependent manner reduced by irbesartan. The findings of our study demonstrated that the AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan exerts a protective role in an in vitro hypoxic condition reducing oxidative stress and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4235911929,"Background Zimbabwe has the highest contraceptive prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, but also one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world. Little is known, however, about the incidence of abortion and post-abortion care (PAC) in Zimbabwe. Access to legal abortion is rare, and limited to circumstances of rape, incest, fetal impairment, or to save the woman’s life. Objectives This paper estimates a) the national provision of PAC, b) the first-ever national incidence of induced abortion in Zimbabwe, and c) the proportion of pregnancies that are unintended. Methods We use the Abortion Incidence Complications Method (AICM), which indirectly estimates the incidence of induced abortion by obtaining a national estimate of PAC cases, and then estimates what proportion of all induced abortions in the country would result in women receiving PAC. Three national surveys were conducted in 2016: a census of health facilities with PAC capacity (n = 227), a prospective survey of women seeking abortion-related care in a nationally-representative sample of those facilities (n = 127 facilities), and a purposive sample of experts knowledgeable about abortion in Zimbabwe (n = 118). The estimate of induced abortion, along with census and Demographic Health Survey data was used to estimate unintended pregnancy. Results There were an estimated 25,245 PAC patients treated in Zimbabwe in 2016, but there were critical gaps in their care, including stock-outs of essential PAC medicines at half of facilities. Approximately 66,847 induced abortions (uncertainty interval (UI): 54,000–86,171) occurred in Zimbabwe in 2016, which translates to a national rate of 17.8 (UI: 14.4–22.9) abortions per 1,000 women 15–49. Overall, 40% of pregnancies were unintended in 2016, and one-quarter of all unintended pregnancies ended in abortion. Conclusion Zimbabwe has one of the lowest abortion rates in sub-Saharan Africa, likely due to high rates of contraceptive use. There are gaps in the health care system affecting the provision of quality PAC, potentially due to the prolonged economic crisis. These findings can inform and improve policies and programs addressing unsafe abortion and PAC in Zimbabwe."
https://openalex.org/W2898274655,"Botswana is close to reaching the UNAIDS ""90-90-90"" HIV testing, antiretroviral treatment (ART), and viral suppression goals. We sought to determine HIV incidence in this setting with both high HIV prevalence and high ART coverage.We used a cross-sectional approach to assessing HIV incidence. A random, population-based sample of adults age 16-64 years was enrolled in 30 rural and peri-urban communities as part of the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP), from October 2013 -November 2015. Data and samples from the baseline household survey were used to estimate cross-sectional HIV incidence, following an algorithm that combined Limiting-Antigen Avidity Assay (LAg-Avidity EIA), ART status (documented or by testing ARV drugs in plasma) and HIV-1 RNA load. The LAg-Avidity EIA cut-off normalized optical density (ODn) was set at 1.5. The HIV-1 RNA cut-off was set at 400 copies/mL. For estimation purposes, the Mean Duration of Recent Infection was 130 days and the False Recent Rate (FRR) was evaluated at values of either 0 or 0.39%.Among 12,610 individuals participating in the baseline household survey, HIV status was available for 12,570 participants and 3,596 of them were HIV positive. LAg-Avidity EIA data was generated for 3,581 (99.6%) of HIV-positive participants. Of 326 participants with ODn ≤1.5, 278 individuals were receiving ART verified through documentation and were considered to represent longstanding HIV infections. Among the remaining 48 participants who reported no use of ART, 14 had an HIV-1 RNA load ≤400 copies/mL (including 3 participants with ARVs in plasma) and were excluded, as potential elite/viremic controllers or undisclosed ART. Thus, 34 LAg-Avidity-EIA-recent, ARV-naïve individuals with detectable HIV-1 RNA (>400 copies/mL) were classified as individuals with recent HIV infections. The annualized HIV incidence among 16-64 year old adults was estimated at 1.06% (95% CI 0.68-1.45%) with zero FRR, and at 0.64% (95% CI 0.24-1.04%) using a previously defined FRR of 0.39%. Within a subset of younger individuals 16-49 years old, the annualized HIV incidence was estimated at 1.29% (95% CI 0.82-1.77%) with zero FRR, and at 0.90% (95% CI 0.42-1.38%) with FRR set to 0.39%.Using a cross-sectional estimate of HIV incidence from 2013-2015, we found that at the time of near achievement of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, ~1% of adults (age 16-64 years) in Botswana's rural and peri-urban communities became HIV infected annually."
https://openalex.org/W2898564435,"Background Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure. MI has been intricately linked to ventricular remodeling, subsequently leading to the reduction in the cardiac ejection fraction causing HF. The cumulative line of evidence suggests an important role of several biomarkers in modulating the cardiac vasculature, further contributing towards the progression of post-MI complications. Studies have demonstrated, yet not fully established, that an important biomarker, IL-10, has a causal relationship with MI and associated cardiac dysfunction. Hypothesis This study aims to establish the role of IL-10 as a prognostic marker for the cardiovascular outcomes and to develop a panel of biomarkers and circulating miRNAs that could potentially result in the early detection of HF resulting from MI, allowing for early intervention strategies. Methods and results Blood was withdrawn and echocardiography assessment was performed on a total of 43 patients that were enrolled, within 24 hours of the incidence of MI. Patients were divided in three main groups, based on the ejection fraction measurement from echocardiography: control (n = 14), MI with normal EF (MI+NEF, n = 13) and MI with low EF (MI+LEF, n = 16). Our results showed that TGFβ-1, TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP-9 were upregulated significantly in MI+NEF group and more so in MI+LEF group, as compared to control group (p<0.01). The circulating levels of miR-34a, miR-208b and miR-126 were positively correlated and showed elevated levels in the MI+NEF group, even higher in MI+LEF group, while levels of miR-24 and miR-29a were reduced in MI+NEF, and much lower in MI+LEF, as compared to the control group (p<0.01). Our results also demonstrated a direct correlation of IL-10 with the ejection fraction in patients with MI: IL-10 was elevated in MI+NEF group, however, the levels were significantly low in MI+LEF group suggesting an important role of IL-10 in predicting heart failure. Importantly, our study confirmed the correlation of IL-10 with EF by our follow-up echocardiography assessment that was performed 2 months after the incidence of MI. Conclusion Our results support the clinical application of these serum biomarkers to develop a panel for appropriate prognosis and management of adverse cardiac remodeling and development of heart failure post-myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2898192434,"The sequence drafts of wild emmer and bread wheat facilitated high resolution, genome-wide analysis of transposable elements (TEs), which account for up to 90% of the wheat genome. Despite extensive studies, the role of TEs in reshaping nascent polyploid genomes remains to be fully understood. In this study, we retrieved miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) from the recently published genome drafts of Triticum aestivum, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, Aegilops tauschii and the available genome draft of Triticum urartu. Overall, 239,126 MITE insertions were retrieved, including 3,874 insertions of a newly identified, wheat-unique MITE family that we named “Inbar”. The Stowaway superfamily accounts for ~80% of the retrieved MITE insertions, while Thalos is the most abundant family. MITE insertions are distributed in the seven homologous chromosomes of the wild emmer and bread wheat genomes. The remarkably high level of insertions in the B sub-genome (~59% of total retrieved MITE insertions in the wild emmer genome draft, and ~41% in the bread wheat genome draft), emphasize its highly repetitive nature. Nearly 52% of all MITE insertions were found within or close (less than 100bp) to coding genes, and ~400 MITE sequences were found in the bread wheat transcriptome, indicating that MITEs might have a strong impact on wheat genome expression. In addition, ~40% of MITE insertions were found within TE sequences, and remarkably, ~90% of Inbar insertions were located in retrotransposon sequences. Our data thus shed new light on the role of MITEs in the diversification of allopolyploid wheat species."
https://openalex.org/W2898519117,"Objective To investigate the relationship between tendon structural changes determined by static ultrasound images (US) and sensory changes using quantitative sensory testing (QST), and clinical measures in lateral epicondylalgia. Materials and methods Both elbows of 66 adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of lateral epicondylalgia were investigated. Using a standardised ultrasound image rating scale, common extensor hypoechogenicity, heterogenicity, neovascularity, and bony abnormalities at the enthesis were scored, and tendon thickness (longitudinal and transverse plane) was measured by a trained assessor. Sensory measures of pressure, heat and cold pain thresholds and vibration detection threshold were recorded. Pain and function were assessed using the patient-rated tennis elbow (PRTEE), pain-free grip strength, pain visual analog scale (PVAS) and quality of life (EuroQoL EQ -5D). Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to explore the association between tendon structural, sensory and clinical variables which were adjusted for age, gender and duration of symptoms. Results A negative correlation was identified between the presence of neovascularity and cold pain threshold (P = 0.015). Multiple regression analyses revealed that a combination of female gender (P = 0.044) and transverse tendon thickness (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with vibration detection threshold in affected elbows, while gender (P = 0.012) and total ultrasound scale score (P = 0.024) were significantly associated with heat pain threshold and vibration detection threshold in unaffected elbows. Heat pain threshold and gender were significantly associated with pain and disability (PRTEE; P < 0.001), and pain-free grip strength (P < 0.001) respectively, in the affected elbows. Conclusion Generally, structural and sensory measures were weakly correlated. However, neovascularity and transverse tendon thickness may be related to sensory system changes in LE."
https://openalex.org/W2898102091,"The Erica genus has as yet not been investigated satisfactorily in terms of palynology. Its complicated taxonomic system, large number of species, as well as its extensive but disrupted range of occurrence, all contribute to the fact that few researchers have undertaken investigations of this species. It was assumed that the research results would be representative thanks to a complex comparative analysis of all diagnostical, morphological pollen features performed on properly selected plant material, representing the most important distinguished intrageneric taxons at the present time (45 species from all five subgenera and 22 sections), both discriminated pollen dispersal units (tetrads and monads) as well as the main centres of genus occurrence and diversification (species from Europe, the Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Madagascar). The study revealed that the diagnostic features of the pollen grains studied were: pollen dispersal unit, exine ornamentation, P/E ratio, tetrad diameter (D) and length of polar axis (P). On the basis of these traits, 14 Erica species (six creating monads and eight—tetrads) were distinguished which, in the case of pollen features, constitutes a significant number. Other heaths created small groups, usually containing two or three species, but up to seven species. The present study, based on the highest number of Erica species (45) analysed so far, corroborated the view that an examination of palynological features may assist in clarifying classification systems for the large and taxonomically very difficult Erica genus, in particular, at the level of the subgenus and section, but also at species level.

Compared to the host leaf, gall tissues lose photosynthetic ability, but have higher soluble sugar content. Although the physiological and biochemical regulation of gall tissues have been demonstrated, the mechanism of genetic regulation has only been analyzed in few studies. Results In this study, the transcriptome of cup-shaped galls and its host leaf were de novo assembled. Cellular functional enrichment and differentially expressed gene groups in the gall tissues were analyzed. The genes associated with primary metabolism, including photosynthesis, cell wall turnover, and sugar degradation, were expressed differently in galls and leaves. The examination of gene expression demonstrated that the genes involved in brassinosteroid synthesis and responses exhibited a remarkable modulation in cup-shaped galls, suggesting a potential role of steroid hormones in regulating gall development. Conclusions This study revealed the genetic responses, including those involved in source-sink reallocation and phytohormone metabolism, of galls induced by a dipteran insect."
https://openalex.org/W2898290334,"Honeybees construct nests that consist of regularly arrayed hexagonal cylinders. In the first stage of honeycomb construction, they build a linear sequence of tetrapod structures that form the basis of the comb. However, considering their physiological limitations, it is unknown how honeybees produce that initial pattern. Herein, in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of honeycomb construction, we propose an agent-based model, the attachment-excavation model, in which worker honeybees are classified into attachers who secrete and attach wax, and excavators who excise the attached wax. The model assumes that workers instinctively refrain from digging through the thin parts of a wax cluster. We then conduct two-dimensional (2D) simulations that show how a tripod pattern can be seen as a projection of tetrapods onto a plane. The simulation results show that the tripod pattern emerges due to competition between the attachers and excavators. As time advances, the isotropic wax growth causes the tripods to connect planarly. Because the homogeneously broadened structures do not match that of a natural comb, we employ anisotropic wax growth to obtain a linear sequence of constructed tripods, thus suggesting that anisotropy is a significant contributor to the first stage of honeycomb construction. From our simulation results, we conclude that honeybees utilize self-organization to achieve complexity during the first stage of honeycomb construction. It is anticipated that the results of our study will provide insights into how complexity can be achieved within a hierarchy."
https://openalex.org/W2898458186,"Plant communities in forest-grassland ecotones of the European Alps are already suffering from gradual climate change and will likely be exposed to more frequent and intense drought periods in the future. Yet, how gradual climate change and extreme drought will affect the stability of these plant communities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how drought modulates the effects of gradual climate change on the long-term structural stability of these ecotone communities using a multidimensional approach. Using a spatially explicit landscape vegetation model, we simulated three drought scenarios, on top of gradual changes of climate variables, and their impacts on the dynamics of 24 plant functional groups, distinguishing between forests and grasslands, as well as different land uses. We then used n-dimensional hypervolumes to define community states under the different drought scenarios, and compared them to initial conditions to assess changes in community structural stability. In general, added drought effects did not counteract the long-term consequences of gradual climate changes, although they resulted in quantitatively different effects. Importantly, drought and climate change had non-negligible consequences for taxonomic and functional structure that differed between communities and land-use regimes. For instance, forest taxonomic structure was more overall more stable than grassland’s, despite the observed functional shifts towards more warm-adapted species compositions. Conversely, unmanaged grasslands were the least stable, suffering the loss of characteristic alpine species. Also, while frequent and severe drought regimes caused forests to become more variable in time, they had the opposite effect on grasslands. Our results agree with observations of drought- and climate-driven changes in mountain communities of the Alps, and we discuss their relevance for ecosystem management. Importantly, we demonstrate the utility of this multidimensional approach to study community stability for analysing cross-community and cross-disturbance responses to global change."
https://openalex.org/W2898134437,"Fibronectin is a blood and extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays important roles in wound healing and fibrosis since it controls the deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix molecules and is a substrate for infiltrating lymphocytes. Using a high-affinity fibronectin-binding peptide (FUD/pUR4) that inhibits fibronectin deposition into extracellular matrix (ECM), we tested the ability of a PEGylated FUD/pUR4 (PEG-FUD) to inhibit fibrosis in the Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO) kidney disease model. Fibronectin fibrillogenesis assays, using human fibroblasts and human proximal tubular epithelial cultures, showed that PEG-FUD can inhibit fibronectin fibrillogenesis in vitro with an IC50 similar to unconjugated FUD, in the order of 20–35 nM. In contrast, a mutated FUD (mFUD) conjugated to PEG that lacked activity did not inhibit fibronectin assembly, even at 20 μM. The in vivo activity of PEG-FUD was tested in the murine UUO model by daily subcutaneous injection of 12.5 mg/kg for 7 days until harvest at day 10. Control treatments included saline, PEG, unconjugated FUD, and PEG-mFUD. Immunoblotting studies showed that fibronectin was enriched in the extracellular matrix fractions of extracted UUO kidneys, compared to contralateral untreated kidneys. In vivo, PEG-FUD significantly decreased fibronectin by ~70% in UUO kidneys as determined by both IHC and immunoblotting, respectively. In contrast, neither PEG-mFUD, PEG, nor saline had any significant effect. PEG-FUD also decreased collagens I and III and CD45-expressing cells (leukocytes) by ~60% and ~50%, as ascertained by picrosirius red staining and IHC, respectively. Immunoblotting studies also showed that the fibronectin remaining after PEG-FUD treatment was intact. Utilizing a custom-made polyclonal antibody generated against pUR4/FUD, intact PEG-FUD was detected by immunoblotting in both the ECM and lysate fractions of UUO kidneys. No adverse reaction or event was noted with any treatment. In summary, these studies suggest that PEG-FUD reached the kidneys without degradation, and decreased fibronectin incorporation into interstitial tissue. Decreased fibronectin was accompanied by a decrease in collagen and leukocyte infiltration. We propose that PEG-FUD, a specific inhibitor of fibronectin assembly, may be a candidate therapeutic for the treatment of fibrosis in kidney diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2898222355,"The parasitic insect Xenos vesparum induces noticeable behavioral and physiological changes—e.g. castration—in its female host, the paper wasp Polistes dominula: parasitized putative workers avoid any colony task and desert the colony to survive in the nearby vegetation, like future queens and males do. In this long-term observational study, we describe the spectacular attraction of parasitized workers towards trumpet creeper bushes (Campsis radicans) in early-summer. Two thirds of all wasps that we sampled on these bushes were parasitized, whereas the parasite prevalence was much lower in our study area and most wasps sampled on other nearby flowering bushes were non-parasitized. First, we describe the occurrence and consistency of this phenomenon across different sites and years. Second, we evaluate the spatial behavior of parasitized wasps on C. radicans bushes, which includes site-fidelity, exploitation and defense of rich extra-floral nectaries on buds and calices. Third, we record two critical steps of the lifecycle of X. vesparum on C. radicans: the parasite’s mating and a summer release of parasitic larvae, that can infect larval stages of the host if transported to the host’s nest. In a nutshell, C. radicans bushes provide many benefits both to the parasite X. vesparum and to its host: they facilitate the parasite’s mating and bivoltine lifecycle, a phenomenon never described before for this parasite, while, at the same time, they provide the wasp host with shelter inside trumpet flowers and extrafloral gland secretions, thus likely enhancing host survival and making it a suitable vector for the infection."
https://openalex.org/W2898449065,"Paleopathologies document skeletal damage in extinct organisms and can be used to infer the causes of injury, as well as aspects of related biology, ecology and behavior. To date, few studies have been undertaken on Jurassic marine reptiles, while ichthyosaur pathologies in particular have never been systematically evaluated. Here we survey 41 specimens of the apex predator ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus from the Early Jurassic of southern Germany in order to document the range and absolute frequency of pathologies observed in this taxon as a function of the number of specimens examined. According to our analysis, most observed pathologies in Temnodontosaurus are force-induced traumas with signs of healing, possibly inflicted during aggressive interactions with conspecifics. When the material is preserved, broken ribs are correlated in most of the cases with traumas elsewhere in the skeleton such as cranial injuries. The range of cranial pathologies in Temnodontosaurus is similar to those reported for extinct cetaceans and mosasaurs, which were interpreted as traces of aggressive encounters. Nevertheless, Temnodontosaurus differs from these other marine amniotes in the absence of pathologies in the vertebral column, consistent with the pattern previously documented in ichthyosaurs. We did not detect any instances of avascular necrosis in Temnodontosaurus from southern Germany, which may reflect a shallow diving life style. This study is intended to provide baseline data for the various types of observed pathologies in large ichthyosaurs occupying the ‘apex predator’ niche, and potentially clarifies aspects of species-specific behavior relative to other ichthyosaurs and marine amniotes."
https://openalex.org/W2898453594,"Background The various conditions causing a chronic increase of RV pressure greatly differ in the occurrence of RV failure, and in clinical outcome. To get a better understanding of the differences in outcome, RV remodeling, longitudinal function, and transverse function are compared between patients with pulmonary stenosis (PS), those with a systemic RV and those with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Materials and methods This cross-sectional study prospectively enrolled subjects for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), functional echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The study included: controls (n = 37), patients with PS (n = 15), systemic RV (n = 19) and PH (n = 20). Statistical analysis was performed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with posthoc Bonferroni. Results PS patients had smaller RV volumes with higher RV ejection fraction (61.1±9.6%; p<0.05) compared to controls (53.8±4.8%). PH and systemic RV patients exhibited dilated RVs with lower RV ejection fraction (36.9±9.6% and 46.3±10.1%; p<0.01 versus controls). PH patients had lower RV stroke volume (p = 0.02), RV ejection fractions (p<0.01) and VO2 peak/kg% (p<0.001) compared to systemic RV patients. Mean apical transverse RV free wall motion was lower and RV free wall shortening (p<0.001) was prolonged in PH patients–resulting in post-systolic shortening and intra-ventricular dyssynchrony. Apical transverse shortening and global longitudinal RV deformation showed the best correlation to RV ejection fraction (respectively r = 0.853, p<0.001 and r = 0.812, p<0.001). Conclusions RV remodeling and function differed depending on the etiology of RV pressure overload. In contrast to the RV of patients with PS or a systemic RV, in whom sufficient stroke volumes are maintained, the RV of patients with PH seems unable to compensate for its increase in afterload completely. Key mediators of RV dysfunction observed in PH patients, were: prolonged RV free wall shortening, resulting in post-systolic shortening and intra-ventricular dyssynchrony, and decreased transverse function."
https://openalex.org/W2898573658,"Understanding which factors enhance or mitigate the impact of high temperatures on corals is crucial to predict the severity of coral bleaching worldwide. On the one hand, global warming is usually associated with high ultraviolet radiation levels (UVR), and surface water nutrient depletion due to stratification. On the other hand, eutrophication of coastal reefs increases levels of inorganic nutrients and decreases UVR, so that the effect of different combinations of these stressors on corals is unknown. In this study, we assessed the individual and crossed effects of high temperature, UVR and nutrient level on the key performance variables of the reef building coral Pocillopora damicornis. We found that seawater warming was the major stressor, which induced bleaching and impaired coral photosynthesis and calcification in all nutrient and UVR conditions. The strength of this effect however, was nutrient dependent. Corals maintained in nutrient-depleted conditions experienced the highest decrease in net photosynthesis under thermal stress, while nutrient enrichment (3 μM NO3- and 1 μM PO4+) slightly limited the negative impact of temperature through enhanced protein content, photosynthesis and respiration rates. UVR exposure had only an effect on total nitrogen release rates, which significantly decreased under normal growth conditions and tended to decrease also under thermal stress. This result suggests that increased level of UVR will lead to significant changes in the nutrient biogeochemistry of surface reef waters. Overall, our results show that environmental factors have different and interactive effects on each of the coral's physiological parameters, requiring multifactorial approaches to predict the future of coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2898152842,"Introduction Trimethylation of histone H3K36 (H3K36me3), an epigenetic marker of transcription-associated histone modification and stem cell regulation, is expressed in a variety of human cancers. This study elucidated the prognostic significance of H3K36me3 in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Expression of H3K36me3 was retrospectively evaluated through immunohistochemistry in 152 surgically resected primary HCCs. Results In nontumorous liver parenchyma, H3K36Me3 was detected in bile ducts but not in hepatocytes. H3K36me3 was positive in 104 (68.4%) of the HCCs. Positivity for H3K36me3 was associated with high level of serum α-fetoprotein (>200 ng/mL, P = 0.0148), high tumor grade (P = 0.0017), and high tumor stage (P = 0.0008). Patients with H3K36me3-positive tumors were more likely to have lower 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival than those with H3K36me3-negative tumors (P = 0.0484 and P = 0.0213, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that H3K36me3 positivity was an independent predictor of high tumor grade (P = 0.0475) and high tumor stage (P = 0.0114) and thus contributed to poor prognosis. Furthermore, H3K36me3 positivity was significantly correlated with the expression of biliary markers cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF1β) (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Combinatorial analysis revealed that CK19 and HNF1β expression individually exerted additive prognostic adverse effects on HCCs with H3K36me3 positivity. Conclusions Our study indicates that H3K36me3 positivity is associated with the expression of biliary markers and is a crucial predictor of poor prognosis in resectable HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2898318090,"Background and aim Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been accepted as the treatment of choice for early gastric cancer (EGC) without lymph node metastasis. However, additional surgical gastrectomy should be considered after non-curative endoscopic resection. We aimed to evaluate the predictive factors associated with non-curative endoscopic resection. Methods Between November 2008 and June 2015, a retrospective study was conducted in a single, tertiary, referral hospital. A total of 596 EGC lesions resected by ESD were analyzed. Non-curative endoscopic resection was defined as the occurrence of lesions associated with piecemeal resection, positive resection margins, lymphovascular invasion, or lesions that did not meet the expanded indications for ESD. Results The rate of non-curative endoscopic resection was 16.1%. The mean follow-up period was 35.3 ± 25.0 months. Associated predictive factors for non-curative endoscopic resection were female sex (OR, 2.470; p = 0.004), lesion size ≥ 20 mm (OR 3.714; p < 0.001), longer procedure time (OR 2.449, p = 0.002), ulceration (OR 3.538, p = 0.002), nodularity (OR 2.967, p<0.001), depression (OR 1.806, p = 0.038), undifferentiated carcinoma (OR 2.825, p = 0.031) and lesion located in the mid or upper third of stomach (OR 7.135 and OR 4.155, p<0.001, respectively). As the number of risk factors increased, the risk of non-curative ESD also increased. Conclusions Prior to selection of ESD, the risks associated with non-curative ESD should be considered so that appropriate treatment modalities may be selected."

Paracaedimonas acanthamoeba”, and another to the endosymbiont of Acanthamoeba UWC8 and “Ca. Jidaibacter acanthamoeba” are described. For endocytobiont screening, we developed a PCR method with a set of broad-range bacterial 16S rRNA primers to substitute the commonly used but technically demanding fluorescent in situ hybridization technique. Our PCR test alone without sequencing failed to discriminate the endocytobiont-containing and endocytobiont-free Acanthamoeba sp. due to the presence of mismatched primers to host mitochondrial DNA. We highlighted the need to perform bacterial primer checking against the Acanthamoeba genome to avoid false positive detection in PCR. Although the genetic aspect of “Ca. Caedibacter acanthamoebae”/“Ca. Paracaedimonas acanthamoeba” and the endosymbiont of Acanthamoeba UWC8/“Ca. Jidaibacter acanthamoeba” are well studied, knowledge pertaining to their morphologies are quite vague. Hence, we used transmission electron microscopy to examine our endocytobionts which are affiliated to previously described intracellular bacteria of Acanthamoeba sp. We used good-quality TEM images for the localization and the fate of the current endocytobionts inside different life stages of the hosts. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our TEM findings are the first to provide morphological evidence for the clearance of defective Acanthamoeba endocytobionts via an autophagic-like process."
https://openalex.org/W2898589255,"Type 2 diabetes is typified by insulin-resistance in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver, leading to chronic hyperglycemia. Additionally, obesity and type 2 diabetes are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation. Membrane-associated RING-CH-1 (MARCH1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase best known for suppression of antigen presentation by dendritic and B cells. MARCH1 was recently found to negatively regulate the cell surface levels of the insulin receptor via ubiquitination. This, in turn, impaired insulin sensitivity in mouse models. Here, we report that MARCH1-deficient (knockout; KO) female mice exhibit excessive weight gain and excessive visceral adiposity when reared on standard chow diet, without increased inflammatory cell infiltration of adipose tissue. By contrast, male MARCH1 KO mice had similar weight gain and visceral adiposity to wildtype (WT) male mice. MARCH1 KO mice of both sexes were more glucose tolerant than WT mice. The levels of insulin receptor were generally higher in insulin-responsive tissues (especially the liver) from female MARCH1 KO mice compared to males, with the potential to account in part for the differences between male and female MARCH1 KO mice. We also explored a potential role for MARCH1 in human type 2 diabetes risk through genetic association testing in publicly-available datasets, and found evidence suggestive of association. Collectively, our data indicate an additional link between immune function and diabetes, specifically implicating MARCH1 as a regulator of lipid metabolism and glucose tolerance, whose function is modified by sex-specific factors."
https://openalex.org/W2898512333,"Post-marketing surveillance activities (namely pharmacovigilance) are crucial to favor the early detection of unexpected adverse events (AEs) and/or serious adverse reactions (SAEs). Indeed, spontaneous reporting of AEs has been demonstrated to underestimate the number of events in different clinical settings. Aim of the present study is to report the preliminary data of a Regional (Calabria, Italy) Pharmacovigilance Program (CBPP) aimed at improving AEs' reporting associated with biologics use in rheumatology.We developed a simple, cost-effective pharmacovigilance program based on regular training sessions for physicians (stimulated reporting), periodical phone calls by a clinical pharmacologist aimed at identifying new events and stimulating self-awareness and encouraging reporting to the physician during the subsequent follow-up visit for minor AEs. To test this approach, all consecutive patients undergoing treatment with one biologic agent at eight rheumatology centers during a two-years period were invited to participate. Collected AEs were compared to the number of AEs spontaneously reported for the same molecules in the same centers before starting the protocol.During the study period, 399 patients (245 females; mean age: 58 ± 11 years) were started on treatment with biologics for active RA (n = 211, 52.9%), PsA (n = 119, 29.8%) or AS (n = 69, 17.3%) at eight rheumatology centers. A total of 125 AEs (31.3%) and 9 SAEs (2.3%) were reported during the two-years study period. In the control cohort (comprising 368 consecutive patients started on treatment with bDMARDs during a two-years period before CBPP study) only 42 (11.4%) AEs and no SAEs were reported (p < 0.0001). The most common AEs were injection site reactions and skin disorders.In conclusion, our study provides further evidence of a critical role of active pharmacovigilance in detection, reporting and analysis of AEs in rheumatology."
https://openalex.org/W2898589647,"A common two-tier structure for social networks is based on partitioning society into two parts, referred to as the elite and the periphery, where the “elite” is the relatively small but well-connected and highly influential group of powerful individuals around which the society is centered, and the “periphery” consists of the rest of society. It is observed that the relative sizes of economic and social elites in various societies appear to be continually declining. One possible explanation is that this is a natural social phenomenon, resembling Price’s “square root” law for the fraction of good scientists in the scientific community. We try to assess the validity of this explanation by studying the elite-periphery structure via introducing a novel axiom-based model for representing and measuring the influence between the elite and the periphery. The model is accompanied by a set of axioms that capture the elite’s dominance, robustness and density, as well as a compactness property. Relying on the model and the accompanying axioms, we are able to draw a number of insightful conclusions about the elite-periphery structure. In particular, we show that in social networks that respect our axioms, the size of a compact elite is sublinear in the network size. This agrees with Price’s principle but appears to contradict the common belief that the elite size tends to a linear fraction of society (recently claimed to be around 1%). We propose a natural method to create partitions with nice properties, based on the key observation that an elite-periphery partition is at what we call a ‘balance point’, where the elite and the periphery maintain a balance of powers. Our method is based on setting the elite to be the k most influential nodes in the network and suggest the balance point as a tool for choosing k and therefore the size of the elite. When using nodes degrees to order the nodes, the resulting k-rich club at the balance point is the elite of a partition we refer to as the balanced edge-based partition. We accompany these findings with an empirical study on 32 real-world social networks, which provides evidence that balanced edge-based partitions which satisfying our axioms commonly exist."
https://openalex.org/W2898592439,"Background and purpose National dietary guidelines are intended to promote primary prevention of lifestyle-related diseases, but little is known about their effectiveness in prevention of stroke. Methods We used the Danish cohort Diet, Cancer and Health (n = 57 053) to investigate whether adherence to the Danish food-based dietary guidelines was associated with risk of stroke. Adherence was assessed by the Danish Dietary Guidelines Index, score 0 [no adherence] to 6 [complete adherence]. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for stroke and subtypes of stroke in men and women separately. Results Incident stroke was determined in 1357 men and 900 women during follow-up (median 12.5 years and 13.0 years, respectively). A higher Danish Dietary Guidelines Index score was inversely associated with total stroke in men but not in women. In men, a high Index score (≥4) was also inversely associated with total ischemic stroke (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.65–0.86), large-artery atherosclerosis (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.44–0.92) and small artery occlusion (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.84) compared to a low Index score (<4). In women, inverse associations were found for total ischemic stroke (hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.72–0.98) and intracerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.43–0.96). Conclusions Our findings suggest that adherence to the Danish Dietary Guidelines is associated with a lower rate of stroke, and thus may be useful in primary prevention of disease."

This study investigates the key factors that influenced actual public insurance reimbursement decisions, including the role of economic evidence, after 10 years of decision practice under compulsory health technology assessment (HTA) for new drugs.Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of the variables involved, including cost-effectiveness ratio as a key variable, on reimbursement decisions. The latter were defined as ""yes"" or ""no"" at a submitted price and indication. Only cases (n = 91) that present a cost-effectiveness ratio, and that have been reviewed based on this ratio from January 2007 to December 2016, were included in the analysis.Cases with higher cost-effectiveness ratios were less likely to be accepted. In addition, drugs that were used to treat severe diseases and drugs with no substitute were more likely to be recommended. The probability of acceptance declined along with the level of uncertainty in the submitted evidence. The acceptance rate for severe-disease drugs has increased since 2013, when the government introduced several policies that lowered the existing barriers to positive reimbursement. However, such an increase was not statistically significant.Cost-effectiveness is one of the most influential factors in drug-reimbursement decisions. However, inclusion of other explanatory variables, in addition to the cost-effectiveness ratio, predicted the results of decisions more accurately."
https://openalex.org/W2898427744,"This study examines two different strategies with respect to managing the order in which information about genetically modified (GM) technology would reach and impact consumers of edamame, often referred to as the ""vegetable soybean"". Edamame are soybeans harvested while the beans are young and soft. We capture consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for unlabeled edamame, non-GM edamame, and GM edamame using a non-hypothetical random nth price auction. We elicit consumers' valuation for each edamame product before and after introducing information, and test two strategies where the order of providing positive and negative information is reversed. The results suggest that negative information affects WTP to a much greater extent than positive information. Hence a strategy to proactively deal with eventual negative press about GM technology did not lead to a different result than a strategy that would react to or attempt to thwart negative information with positive information at a later date. These findings suggest that it would be difficult to introduce new GM edamame as edible products in the market as marginally negative preconceptions about GM at the time of the experiment were easier to reinforce with negative information than to combat with positive information about GM."
https://openalex.org/W2898141121,"The temporal modulation structure of speech plays a key role in neural encoding of the speech signal. Amplitude modulations (AMs, quasi-rhythmic changes in signal energy or intensity) in speech are encoded by neuronal oscillations (rhythmic variations in neural excitability in large cell networks) that oscillate at matching temporal rates. To date, however, all neural studies have investigated adult-directed speech (ADS) as produced and perceived by highly literate adults. Whether temporal features of ADS vary with the skills of the speaker, for example literacy skills, is currently unknown. Here we analyse the temporal structure of ADS spoken by illiterate, low literate (≤ 4 years of literacy) and highly literate (≥ 12 years of literacy) adults. We find that illiterates produce speech differently. Spontaneous conversational speech produced by illiterate adults showed significantly less synchronised coupling between AM bands (less phase synchronisation) than conversational speech produced by low literate and highly literate adults, and contained significantly fewer syllables per second. There was also a significant relationship between years of literacy and the amount of theta-band energy in conversational speech. When asked to produce rhythmic proverbs learned in childhood, all groups could produce speech with similar AM phase synchronisation, suggesting that the differences in spontaneous conversational speech were not caused by physiological constraints. The data suggest that the temporal modulation structure of spoken language changes with the acquisition of cultural skills like literacy that are usually a product of schooling. There is a cultural effect on the temporal modulation structure of spoken language."

This study identifies facilitators for smoking cessation, as perceived by minority male smokers, that can inform a culturally appropriate national plan for smoking prevention and cessation. Methods We conducted in 2013 a three-stage study among Arab minority male current and former smokers (ages 18–64) in Israel, among whom smoking is very high: first, a Concept Mapping (CM) study with 102 and 202 participants in the brainstorming, and sorting and rating phases respectively. Second, we assigned clusters identified in the CM study to contingency levels using the Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM). Third, we classified clusters into intervention functions and policies using the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW). Findings The CM study revealed 58 barriers and facilitators for smoking prevention and cessation that were sorted into 11 clusters by the participants. These clusters were analogous to four BEM level contingency of smoking (social, institutional, community and individual). We classified it into two main policy categories, based on the BCW: 1- restructuring the socio-political environment of smoking through affirmative government's policies towards Arab minority in Israel, and 2-developing a culturally appropriate plan for smoking cessation in Arab local authorities including: raising awareness about tobacco hazards; enforcing anti-smoking laws; strengthening community institutional action; providing smoking cessation services; considering raising prices for tobacco products, addressing psychological sources of smoking in Arab men. Conclusions Our study revealed barriers, facilitators and contingencies of smoking prevention and cessation with two main policy action items among the Arab minority in Israel: changing the socio-political environment of smoking, and developing a culturally appropriate smoking prevention and cessation national plan. Our study framework can inform policies and culturally appropriate interventions for smoking prevention and cessation in other minorities."
https://openalex.org/W2898107569,"Bats transition from flightless, milk-sustained infants to volant, foraging juveniles in the span of a few weeks to a few months. This rapid development is accompanied by fast growth and weight gain, but behavioral development remains poorly understood. We addressed development of maternal support and pup independence for Peters' tent-making bat (Uroderma bilobatum) in light of population level reproductive patterns. Uroderma bilobatum exhibited seasonal bimodal polyoestry at our study site. Births occurred over one month within a reproductive bout, resulting in variable levels of behavioral development for pups in the same maternity group. Pups reached adult forearm length more quickly than adult mass, facilitating the ontogeny of flight. Maternal support consisted of nursing and thermoregulation, transporting pups between night and day roosts, and milk provisioning between foraging bouts. We did not observe provisioning with solid food. Pups interacted only with their own mother. Between 25 to 40 days into a reproductive bout they matured by suckling progressively less and fledging over multiple nights in a two-stage process assisted by mothers. We describe several parturition events as well as a novel form of stereotyped tactile stimulation involving forearm pulses by mothers against suckling pups that may serve to promote weaning. Rapid behavioral changes in both pups and mothers accompany pup morphological development through maturation."

All of them performed an incremental CMJ test and an ippon-seoi-nage technique test before (N) and after the ascent to a moderate altitude of 2320 m above the sea level (H). A linear velocity transducer was attached to the bar to assess the mechanical outputs of each loaded CMJ at different percentages of their own body weight (25, 50, 75 and 100%). A wearable sensor was used to assess the kinematic variables (times, accelerations and angular velocities) transferred to a dummy during the technique test. The kinematic variables showed great individual reliability (CV = 8.46% in N; CV = 8.37% in H), which contrasted with low reliability observed when the whole group was considered. The smallest important CV ratio (>1.15) showed that H caused changes in the reliability of the kinematic variables, with some variables becoming more reliable and others losing the reliability they had in N. H also caused small increments in peak velocity across all loads tested in the CMJ (+3.67%; P<0.05). In contrast, no changes in the kinematic variables were verified. In addition, there was no association between leg extension capability and the acceleration (r = -0.16 ± 0.19 in N; r = -0.24 ± 0.19 in H) or angular velocity (r = -0.19 ± 0.24 in N; r = -0.30 ± 0.26 in H) of the ippon-seoi-nage, nor was acute exposure to H found to affect this association (P>0.05). Differences between individual and within-groups CV confirm the individual adaptations that each judoka makes during this technique. Additionally, the CV ratio shows a change in the space-time pattern of the technique in H. Therefore, it would be necessary to include an adaptation period to adapt the technique after the ascent in altitude. Further studies are needed to confirm the relationship and transference from the velocity gains in CMJ during altitude training."
https://openalex.org/W2898104586,"Regular expression matching (REM) is widely employed as the major tool for deep packet inspection (DPI) applications. For automatic processing, the regular expression patterns need to be converted to a deterministic finite automata (DFA). However, with the ever-increasing scale and complexity of pattern sets, state explosion problem has brought a great challenge to the DFA based regular expression matching. Rule grouping is a direct method to solve the state explosion problem. The original rule set is divided into multiple disjoint groups, and each group is compiled to a separate DFA, thus to significantly restrain the severe state explosion problem when compiling all the rules to a single DFA.For practical implementation, the total number of DFA states should be as few as possible, thus the data structures of these DFAs can be deployed on fast on-chip memories for rapid access. In addition, to support fast pattern update in some applications, the time cost for grouping should be as small as possible. In this study, we aimed to propose an efficient grouping method, which generates as few states as possible with as little time overhead as possible.When compiling multiple patterns into a single DFA, the number of DFA states is usually greater than the total number of states when compiling each pattern to a separate DFA. This is mainly caused by the semantic overlaps among different rules. By quantifying the interaction values for each pair of rules, the rule grouping problem can be reduced to the maximum k-cut graph partitioning problem. Then, we propose a heuristic algorithm called the one-step greedy (OSG) algorithm to solve this NP-hard problem. What's more, a subroutine named the heuristic initialization (HI) algorithm is devised to further optimize the grouping algorithms.We employed three practical rule sets for the experimental evaluation. Results show that the OSG algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art grouping solutions regarding both the total number of DFA states and time cost for grouping. The HI subroutine also demonstrates its significant optimization effect on the grouping algorithms.The DFA state explosion problem has became the most challenging issue in the regular expression matching applications. Rule grouping is a practical direction by dividing the original rule sets into multiple disjoint groups. In this paper, we investigate the current grouping solutions, and propose a compact and efficient grouping algorithm. Experiments conducted on practical rule sets demonstrate the superiority of our proposal."
https://openalex.org/W2898385300,"The global implementation of malaria interventions has averted hundreds of millions of clinical malaria cases in the last decade. This study assesses predicted Anopheles mosquito distributions across the United Republic of Tanzania before large-scale insecticide-treated net (ITN) rollouts and indoor residual spraying (IRS) initiatives to determine whether mosquito net usage by children under the age of five and IRS are targeted to areas where historical evidence indicates mosquitoes thrive. Demographic and Health Surveys data from 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 include detailed measurements of mosquito net and IRS use across Tanzania. Anopheline data are far less intensively collected, but we constructed a Maxent-built baseline mosquito habitat suitability (MHS) map (AUC = 0.872) with Tanzanian Anopheles occurrence records from 1999-2003. This MHS model was tested against independently-observed georeferenced Plasmodium falciparum cases from the Malaria Atlas Project, with ~87% of cases from 1999-2003 (n = 107) and ~84% of cases from 1985-2012 (n = 919) occurring in areas of high predicted suitability for mosquitoes. We compared the validated MHS with subsequent malaria interventions using mixed effects logistic regression. Specifically, we assessed whether Anopheles habitat suitability related to the frequency that ≥1 child in a household reportedly slept under a mosquito net when that intervention later became widely available, and whether IRS was reportedly applied to dwellings over a one-year period. There was no evidence that mosquito net use the night before the survey related to MHS from 2011-2012 and marginally significant evidence (p<0.05) from 2015-2016 (β = 1.466, 95% C.I. = 0.848-2.103, marginal R2 = 0.020, respectively). However, the likelihood of IRS treatments rose relatively strongly in the 12 months prior to both surveys (β = 13.466, 95% C.I. = 10.488-16.456, marginal R2 = 0.144, and β = 6.817, 95% C.I. = 5.439-8.303, marginal R2 = 0.136, respectively). IRS treatments have therefore been targeted more effectively than mosquito nets toward areas where anopheline habitat suitability was previously found to be high."
https://openalex.org/W2898332763,"Screening of young women is often discouraged because of the high risk of unnecessary diagnostics or overtreatment. Multiple countries therefore use cytology instead of high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-testing as screening method for young women because of the limited specificity of hrHPV-testing. The objective of this study was to investigate how hrHPV screening before the age of 30, can be used to reduce the future prevalence of high-grade cervical lesions in young women.We retrospectively analyzed follow-up data from a cohort study on HPV prevalence in unscreened Dutch women aged 18-29 years. Women performed multiple self-collected cervico-vaginal samples for HPV detection and genotyping. At least one valid cervical pathology result was obtained from 1,018 women. Women were categorized as hrHPV negative, cleared- or persistent hrHPV infection. Anonymized follow-up data for each group was obtained. Composite outcome measures were defined as; normal, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). The association between prior hrHPV status and cytology and histology outcome was analyzed.After exclusion, a pathology result was registered for 962 women. The prevalence of HSIL was 19.3% in women with a persistent HPV infection at a younger age. This is significantly higher (p<0,001) compared with the HSIL prevalence of 1.5% in HPV-negative women, and 3.1% (n = 8) in women who cleared the hrHPV infection in the past.Women with a persistent hrHPV infection in their 20s, show an increased prevalence of HSIL lesions in their early 30s. Screening for persistent hrHPV infections, instead of cytology screening before the age of 30, can be used to reduce the future prevalence of cervical cancer in young women."
https://openalex.org/W2898387902,"Culture-based detection of Campylobacter can be affected by competing flora, temperature, incubation time, and presence of blood. The presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in poultry has become one of the most common factors interfering with the detection of Campylobacter. In the present study, we evaluated potassium clavulanate (ESBL inhibitor) as a supplement in Bolton broth (C-Bolton broth) for enrichment and detection of Campylobacter. First, we determined growth kinetics of Campylobacter in the presence of different concentrations of ESBL E. coli in C-Bolton broth during enrichment. The effects of other factors such as incubation time, incubation temperature, and presence of blood on Campylobacter detection in C-Bolton broth were also investigated. The growth of Campylobacter co-cultured at a low concentration (2 and 4 log10 CFU/mL) of ESBL E. coli was similar to that of Campylobacter alone in C-Bolton broth, and Campylobacter co-cultured at a high concentration (6 and 8 log10 CFU/mL) of ESBL E. coli showed slower growth than the pure Campylobacter culture. The Campylobacter detection limit was 1 log10 CFU/mL when mixed with 2, 4, or 6 log10 CFU/mL of E. coli and 3 log10 CFU/mL when mixed with 8 log10 CFU/mL of E. coli after 48 h enrichment in the broth. Campylobacter detection from chicken feces and litter samples was not affected by incubation time, or presence of blood in the broth. A modified procedure of enrichment in C-Bolton broth at 37°C for 24 h without blood showed a significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher detection rate and a lower false-negative rate than the ISO 10272-1:2006 method for Campylobacter detection from chicken feces and litter samples. In summary, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of Bolton broth supplemented with potassium clavulanate in the detection of Campylobacter mixed with ESBL E. coli, and an improved procedure to detect Campylobacter from chicken feces and litter samples."
https://openalex.org/W2898323063,"Background The city of Wrocław in Poland represents one of Central Europeans oldest capitals of science with numerous Nobel laureates. Due to a long history of political suppressions with Nazi Germany and Communism from 1933 until 1989, its scientific community was suppressed for more than half a century. Methods The present study assessed scientific activities in the field of social and neighbouring sciences using density equalizing mapping. On the basis of the NewQIS (New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science) platform and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) of the Web of Science database, a total of 1787 articles originating from Wrocław were identified between 1966 and 2017. Results In total, 549 research collaborations of Wrocław with 96 different countries were present (30.7%). Among the 107 research areas the highest activity was found for the field of Business and Economics with n = 272 articles (average citation rate (AVR) of 12.54), followed by Psychology (n = 252 articles, AVR = 9.06), Psychiatry (n = 205 articles, AVR = 4.74) and Public, Environmental and Occupational Health (n = 145 articles, AVR = 7.96). The highest AVR was found for Operations Research (25.36 with n = 87 articles). Density equalizing mapping procedures revealed a global pattern of social sciences research collaborations with scientists from Germany, the UK and the US as the primary cooperating partner of Wrocław. The different countries had major differences in the area of research collaborations. Conclusions This is the first study that depicts the global network of Wrocław scientific activities in the field of social sciences. The exorbitant increase in research activity from 2006 onwards can lead to the assumption that Wrocław social sciences encounter a fruitful future."
https://openalex.org/W2898487163,"Subjects in laboratory settings exhibit straight hand paths-typified by the minimum jerk path-even in the presence of a learned but disturbing force field. At the same time it is known that in this setting, visual feedback strongly influences reaches, biasing them to be straight. Here we examine whether or not this bias can account for the straightness of movements made in a force field. We ran three curl field experiments to investigate how the lack of visual feedback influences adapted reaches. In a first experiment, hand position was displayed at the beginning and at the end of each trial, but extinguished during movement, and the hand was passively brought back to the home location. In the second experiment, visual feedback of neither the hand nor the target was provided, and targets were haptically rendered as ""dimples."" In order to provide extended practice, a third experiment was run with a single target and an active reach back to the home location. In all three cases we found minor changes in the adapted reaches relative to control groups that had full visual feedback. Our subjects adopted trajectories that were better explained by minimum jerk paths over those that minimize effort. The results indicate that for point-to-point reaching movements the visual feedback, or lack there of, cannot explain why reaches appear to be straight, even after adapting to a perturbing force field."
