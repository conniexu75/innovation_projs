https://openalex.org/W1991544298,"The properties of an organic molecular ferromagnet [C(60)TDAE(0.86); TDAE is tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene] with a Curie temperature ;T(c) = 16.1 kelvin are described. The ferromagnetic state shows no remanence, and the temperature dependence of the magnetization below ;T(c) does not follow the behavior expected of a conventional ferromagnet. These results are interpreted as a reflection of a three-dimensional system leading to a soft ferromagnet."

The Sahara Desert ranged from 8,633,000 square kilometers in 1980 to 9,982,000 square kilometers in 1984. The greatest annual north-south latitudinal movement of the southern Saharan boundary was 110 kilometers from 1984 to 1985 and resulted in a decrease in desert area of 724,000 square kilometers."

Properties and important materials constants of current commercial materials and of new, promising, inorganic and organic molecular and polymeric materials with potential in second- and third-order nonlinear optical applications are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1973506949,"Surface vibrational spectroscopy by sum-frequency generation was used to study hydrophobicity at the molecular level at various interfaces: waterâ€”surfactant-coated quartz, water-hexane, and water-air. In all cases, hydrophobicity was characterized by the appearance of dangling hydroxyl bonds on 25 percent of the surface water molecules. At the water-quartz interface, packing restrictions force the water surface layer to have a more ordered, ice-like structure. A partly wettable water-quartz interface was also studied."
https://openalex.org/W2051397621,"Although the three-dimensional structure of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC) reveals a high level of structural symmetry, with two nearly equivalent potential electron transfer pathways, the RC is functionally asymmetric: Electron transfer occurs along only one of the two possible pathways. In order to determine the origins of this symmetry breaking, the internal electric field present in the RC when charge is separated onto structurally characterized sites was probed by using absorption band shifts of the chromophores within the RC. The sensitivity of each probe chromophore to an electric field was calibrated by measuring the Stark effect spectrum, the change in absorption due to an externally applied electric field. A quantitative comparison of the observed absorption band shifts and those predicted from vacuum electrostatics gives information on the effective dielectric constant of the protein complex. These results reveal a significant asymmetry in the effective dielectric strength of the protein complex along the two potential electron transfer pathways, with a substantially higher dielectric strength along the functional pathway. This dielectric asymmetry could be a dominant factor in determining the functional asymmetry of electron transfer in the RC."

https://openalex.org/W2100926596,The long-standing problem of the excess abundances of siderophile elements in the mantle can be resolved by considering an equilibrium core-mantle differentiation in the earth at 3000 to 3500 kelvin. This high-temperature differentiation results in mantle siderophile element abundances that closely match the observed values. Some lithophile (light) elements could enter the core in this process as is necessary to account for its low density. The abundances of siderophile elements in the mantle are consistent with the conclusion derived from the recent physical models that the earth was molten during accretion.

https://openalex.org/W2060231145,"Volcanic fallout deposits on land, being widespread and accessible for study, have received much attention and have revealed a great deal about subaerial eruption mechanisms. In contrast, virtually nothing is known about equivalent deposits produced by submarine volcanoes, despite the probable abundance of such material in today's oceans and in accreted volcanic arc terrains. Many submarine deposits may form by the fallout of debris to the sea floor downcurrent from the umbrella region of submarine eruption columns. Experiments on water-saturated pumice and pieces of rock (lithics) show that particles settling to the sea floor at terminal velocities of 10 to 50 centimeters per second will display conspicuous bimodality of particle diameters: pieces of pumice may be five to ten times as large as codeposited lithic fragments. Similar material, erupted into the air and deposited on land, displays less well-developed bimodality; pumice diameters are generally two to three times as large as associated lithics. Submarine fallout deposits are therefore distinctive and may be used to indicate a subaqueous origin for some of the great thicknesses of nonfossiliferous volcanic debris contained in ancient volcanic terrains worldwide whose environment of deposition has been uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W2075607414,"Seismological observations confirm that the pattern of seismic waves from some earthquakes cannot be produced by slip along a planar fault surface. More than one physical mechanism is required to explain the observed varieties of these non-double-couple earthquakes. The simplest explanation is that some earthquakes are complex, with stress released on two or more suitably oriented, nonparallel fault surfaces. However, some shallow earthquakes in volcanic and geothermal areas require other explanations. Current research focuses on whether fault complexity explains most observed non-double-couple earthquakes and to what extent ordinary earthquakes have non-double-couple components."
https://openalex.org/W1978523294,"Jurassic fossil vertebrates collected from the Falla Formation in the Central Transantarctic Mountains included a partial skull and postcranial elements of a crested theropod, Cryolophosaurus ellioti gen. nov. sp. nov. The theropod bears some resemblance to the large tetanurans of the Middle to Late Jurassic but also has primitive ceratosaurian features. Elements from a prosauropod, teeth from scavenging theropods, a pterosaur humerus, and a tritylodont molar were also recovered. The presence of this fauna suggests that a mild climate existed at high paleolatitude in this area of Gondwana during the Early Jurassic."
https://openalex.org/W2092616330,"Recent space-geodetic observations have revealed daily and subdaily variations in the Earth's rotation rate. Although spectral analysis suggests that the variations are primarily of tidal origin, comparisons to previous theoretical predictions based on various ocean models have been less than satisfactory. This disagreement is partly caused by deficiencies in physical modeling. Rotation predictions based on a reliable tidal-height model, with corresponding tidal currents inferred from a modified form of Laplace's momentum equations, yield predictions of tidal variations in Universal Time that agree with very long baseline interferometer observations to 2 microseconds. This agreement resolves a major discrepancy between theory and observation and establishes the dominant role of oceanic tides for inducing variation in the Earth's rotation at these frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2066274779,"A population genetic analysis of honey bees of the Mexican neotropical Yucatan peninsula shows that the range expansion of Africanized bees there has involved extensive introgressive hybridization with European bees. Yucatan honey bee populations now include many colonies with intermediate morphologies. Genotypes of mitochondria have disassociated from historically correlated Africanized or European morphology, producing diverse phenotypic associations. This suggests that the size of resident European populations may be important in explaining previously reported asymmetrical hybridization. Evidence of natural hybridization is encouraging for the use of genetic management to mitigate the effects of Africanized bees in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2079455564,"The stereoisomers of fully reduced buckminsterfullerene C60H60 have been investigated with the molecular mechanics program MM3. Although it might be expected that chemical reduction would deliver all of the hydrogens to the outside, the symmetric structure produced in this way is predicted to be highly strained. Moving just one hydrogen to the inside is predicted to decrease the energy by 53 kilocalories (kcal) per mole. Putting additional hydrogens on the inside further lowers the predicted energy (depending on the steric relations between them). The minimum energy isomer is predicted to have ten hydrogens inside with C1 symmetry and to have an energy 400 kcal/mol less than that of the all-outside isomer. These results suggest that a process which could achieve isomerization would produce a mixture of isomers, most of which with ten hydrogens on the inside."
https://openalex.org/W2061773156,"Global representations of geoid height and topography are used to map variations in the geoid/topography ratio (admittance) of Venus. The admittance values are permissive of two mutually exclusive models for convection-driven topography. In the first, compressive highland plateaus are expressions of present mantle downwelling, broad volcanic rises are expressions of mantle upwelling, and lowlands overlie regions with no substantial vertical motion in the mantle. In the second, compressive highland plateaus are remnants of an earlier regime of high crustal strain, and most other long-wavelength topographic variations arise from normal convective tractions at the base of the lithosphere."
