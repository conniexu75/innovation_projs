https://openalex.org/W1583858018,"Abstract Transcription of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) gene is regulated by cAMP. To identify the nucleotide sequences in the human VIP gene responsible for this regulation, we constructed chimeric genes containing different portions of the 5'-flanking region of the human VIP gene fused to the structural sequence encoding the bacterial reporter enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The transcriptional activities of the fusion genes introduced into the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 were assayed by measuring CAT activity in the cell lysates. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase-activating agent, stimulated the expression of VIP-CAT fusion genes. Deletional analysis demonstrated that a region between -86 and -70 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional origin of the human VIP gene was responsible for stimulation by forskolin. This region was able to confer cAMP-responsiveness to a gene that is not normally regulated by cAMP. Two copies of a 5 base pair motif, 5'-CGTCA-3', are required for activity of the VIP cAMP regulatory region. This motif is also present in the cAMP regulatory region of several other eukaryotic genes."
https://openalex.org/W1904128007,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta-ARK) is a recently discovered enzyme which specifically phosphorylates the agonist-occupied form of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) as well as the light-bleached form of rhodopsin. beta-ARK is present in a wide variety of mammalian tissues. The kinase can be purified from bovine cerebral cortex to greater than 90% homogeneity by sequential chromatography on Ultrogel AcA34, DEAE-Sephacel, CM-Fractogel, and hydroxylapatite. This results in an approximately 20,000-fold purification with an overall recovery of 12%. The purified kinase has an Mr approximately 80,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several findings indicate that this peptide contains the beta-ARK activity. First, on hydroxylapatite chromatography the enzyme activity coelutes with the Mr approximately 80,000 protein as revealed by Coomassie-Blue staining. Second, under phosphorylating conditions the Mr approximately 80,000 protein is phosphorylated. Finally, the Mr approximately 80,000 protein specifically interacts with reconstituted agonist-occupied beta-AR. Kinetic parameters of the enzyme for beta-AR are Km = 0.25 microM and Vmax = 78 nmol/min/mg whereas for rhodopsin the values are Km = 6 microM and Vmax = 72 nmol/min/mg. The Km value of the enzyme for ATP is approximately 35 microM using either beta-AR or rhodopsin as substrate. Receptor phosphorylation by beta-ARK is effectively inhibited by Zn2+, digitonin and a variety of salts. The availability of purified beta-ARK should greatly facilitate studies of its role in receptor desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1500068886,"Smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) is phosphorylated by the Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, i.e. protein kinase C, at three sites on each 20,000-dalton light chain. Phosphorylation of three sites also is observed with isolated 20,000-dalton light chain and HMM subfragment 1. The phosphorylation sites are serine 1, serine 2, and threonine 9. Threonine is phosphorylated most rapidly followed by either serine 1 or 2. Phosphorylation of the third site occurs only on prolonged incubation. Phosphorylation is a random process. HMM phosphorylated at two sites per light chain by protein kinase C can be dephosphorylated, as shown using two phosphatase preparations. Increasing levels of phosphorylation of HMM by protein kinase C causes a progressive inhibition of the subsequent rate of phosphorylation of serine 19 by myosin light chain kinase and causes a progressive inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity of HMM, prephosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase. Inhibition of ATPase activity is due to a decreased affinity of HMM for actin rather than a change in Vmax. Previous results with HMM and protein kinase C (Nishikawa, M., Sellers, J. R., Adelstein, R. S., and Hidaka, H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8808-8814) examined effects induced by phosphorylation of the threonine residues. Our results confirm these and consider also the influence of higher levels of phosphorylation by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1927828270,"Ornithine decarboxylase of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei brucei had an estimated native molecular weight of 100,000 by gel filtration and a subunit molecular weight of 45,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gene encoding this enzyme, present in a single copy in T. brucei, was identified by mouse ornithine decarboxylase cDNA under relatively stringent conditions of hybridization and subcloned in a 5.9-kilobase (kb) SstI fragment from a cosmid clone into the plasmid pUC 19. This clone encompassed a 2.8-kb SstII fragment that contained the entire T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase gene. The 2.8-kb SstII fragment hybridized to a 2.4-kb mRNA that presumably encodes the parasite enzyme. The 2.8-kb SstII fragment was partially sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 445 amino acids that has 61.5% homology with the corresponding sequence of the mouse enzyme. The only major discrepancies between the two enzymes are the addition of a 20-amino acid N-terminal peptide and the deletion of a 36-amino acid C-terminal peptide and the T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase. The C terminus has been postulated to be one of the structural factors associated with rapid in vivo turnover of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase. The absence of this C-terminal peptide in T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase predicts a slow turnover for the parasite enzyme in vivo, and this is supported by our experimental data. The lack of turnover of ornithine decarboxylase in trypanosomes may constitute the basis of selective antitrypanosomal action of the irreversible enzyme inhibitor DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine."
https://openalex.org/W1566303386,"Electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic examinations revealed that a freshly prepared cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) contains a penta-coordinated high spin ferric protoheme group. The penta-coordinated high spin state of fresh CCP is maintained in a remarkably wide range of pH (4-8). The freezing of fresh CCP induces the reversible coordination of an internal strong field ligand to the heme iron to form a hexa-coordinated low spin compound, which shows EPR extrema at gx = 2.70, gy = 2.20 and gz = 1.78. In the presence of glycerol the freezing-induced artifacts are eliminated and the fresh enzyme exhibits an EPR spectrum of rhombically distorted axial symmetry with EPR extrema at gx = 6.4, gy = 5.3, and gz = 1.97 at 10 K, characteristic of the penta-coordinated high spin enzyme. Upon aging CCP is converted to a hexa-coordinated high spin state due to the coordination of an internal weak field ligand to the heme iron. This conversion is accelerated at acidic pH values, and its reversibility varies from fully reversible to irreversible depending on the degree of enzyme aging. The aging-induced hexa-coordinated CCP is unreactive with hydrogen peroxide and exhibits an EPR spectrum of purely axial symmetry with extrema at g = 6 and g = 2 and an electronic absorption spectrum with an intensified Soret band at 408 nm (epsilon 408 nm = 120 mM-1 cm-1) and a blue-shifted charge-transfer band at 620 nm. Spectroscopic properties of different coordination and spin states of fresh and aged CCPs are compiled in order to formulate a generalized spectroscopic characterization of penta- and hexa-coordinated high spin ferric hemoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1528295287,"Abstract Calcyclin was originally defined as a cDNA clone (2A9) whose cognate RNA is growth-regulated and whose sequence shows strong similarities to the sequences of the S-100 protein, a calcium-binding protein, as well as to a subunit of the major cellular substrate for tyrosine kinase. Using the full-length cDNA, we have now isolated from a human genomic library several phages containing calcyclin sequences. One of the phages, ch. 28-10, contains the entire calcyclin gene, plus extensive flanking sequences. The calcyclin gene is a unique copy gene and has 3 exons. The 5' flanking sequence has been characterized, both structurally and functionally. Besides a TATA box, it contains, in the region proximate to the cap site, GC boxes and a sequence with a strong homology to the enhancer core of the SV40 promoter. Other enhancer-like elements are found scattered in both the 5' and 3' flanking regions. The proximate 5' flanking region is very active in driving the transient expression of linked reporters in transfection experiments. Finally, the calcyclin gene has been localized to the long arm of human chromosome 1, near the ski oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1488777534,"A novel class II beta chain gene is described. This gene, tentatively called DO beta, displays considerably less polymorphism than beta genes of the DP, DQ, and DR loci. The nucleotide sequence of the DO beta gene is strikingly similar to that of the previously identified murine A beta 2 gene. The DO beta gene displays the same exon/intron organization as other beta genes although the fifth exon and the translated portion of the sixth exon are longer than in other genes. A striking feature of the amino acid sequence deduced from the DO beta gene sequence is the pronounced hydrophobicity of the NH2-terminal region. This feature distinguishes the putative DO beta chain from other class II beta chains and raises the possibility that DO beta chains may interact with an alpha chain that is structurally different from those of the DP, DQ, and DR loci. It further suggests that the putative DO molecule may have a function different from those of other class II antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1513185566,"The nuclear gene encoding the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome bc1 complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been isolated and characterized from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used a segment of the iron-sulfur protein gene from Neurospora crassa (Harnisch, U., Weiss, H., and Sebald, W. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 149, 95-99) to detect the yeast gene by Southern analysis. Five different but overlapping clones were then isolated by probing a yeast genomic library carried on YEp 13 by colony lift hybridization. Several approaches confirmed that the isolated DNA contained the gene for the Rieske iron-sulfur protein. The yeast gene, which contains no introns, can be expressed in Escherichia coli. A 900-base pair HindIII-EcoRI fragment was subcloned into pUC19 and directed the synthesis of immunodetectable protein. The gene was also identified by disruption of its chromosomal copy by homologous integration. A 400 base pair PstI-EcoRI fragment cloned adjacent to a HIS3 marker in pUC18 was used as an integrating vector. HIS+ transformants were obtained which were unable to grow on the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol. Southern analysis of the respiration deficient (gly-) strains confirmed that the chromosomal copy of the gene was disrupted, and immunoblots of extracts of the transformants indicated a lack of iron-sulfur protein. A respiration-deficient integrant was transformed to GLY+ by a 2-kilobase pair HindIII-BglII fragment, including a complete copy of the gene, carried on a multicopy episomal vector. Immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies to the iron-sulfur protein indicated overproduction of the protein in the complemented strain and revealed expression of approximately equal amounts of mature iron-sulfur protein and of a protein approximately 3 kDa larger than the mature protein in the complemented strain. A 1.2-kilobase pair segment of DNA from the clone which complemented the disrupted strains was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 645 nucleotides, capable of encoding a 21,946-dalton protein. The gene is flanked by consensus signal sequences for initiation and termination which are common in yeast and is preceded by a possible upstream activating sequence. Amino acid sequence analysis of the amino-terminal end of the mature iron-sulfur protein agreed exactly with that predicted by the nucleotide sequence starting at Lys-31.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1608448968,"We show that DNA fragments, which span the skeletal muscle alpha-actin promoter, form specific complexes with proteins from nuclear extracts of 11 different cultured cell types. These include two myocyte stage specific cell types, myoblast and myotube. The myocyte nuclear extracts are distinguished from all of the others by the electrophoretic mobility of the predominant DNA complex. This complex is greatly diminished in the nine non-myocyte cell types, where a different complex predominates. The major myocyte and non-myocyte complexes are caused by distinct binding activities that compete for the same DNA sequence element. DNA footprint analysis shows that this element is located 78 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site, within a region that appears essential for expression in developing myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1598254601,"We have cloned a complementary DNA for pre-apocytochrome c-552 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The deduced of the mature protein shows high homology to those of cytochromes c-553 from cyanobacteria. Its homology to mitochondrial cytochrome c or bacterial photosynthetic cytochrome c2 is lower and appears to be concentrated in sequences around amino acids involved in the interaction with heme. With respect to primary sequence, the sequence for cytochrome c-552 appears to show no homology to other transit sequences for nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins. However, based on analogy to transit sequences for other proteins (Daldal, F., Cheng, S., Applebaum, J., Davidson, E., and Prince, R. C. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 2012-2016; Goldschmidt-Clermont, M., and Rahire, M. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 191, 421-432; Smeekens, S., de Groot, M., van Binsbergen, J., and Weisbeek, P. (1986) Cell 46, 365-375) the transit of cytochrome c-552 can be divided into envelope-traversing and thylakoid-traversing domains. Cytochrome c-552 appears to encoded by a single nuclear gene in C. reinhardtii. The gene is expressed exclusively in Cu(II)-deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W1607374780,"We have described a cell-free system for studying mRNA degradation (Ross, J., and Kobs, G. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 188, 579-593). Using that system we found that human H4 histone mRNA was degraded in a 3' to 5' direction by an exonucleolytic activity. Here we investigate several properties of the crude system and of the exonuclease. A RNase inhibitor, such as that from placenta, was required to block nonspecific ribonucleases and thereby to permit different mRNAs to be degraded at different rates. The histone mRNA exonuclease required divalent cation (magnesium) but not exogenously added ATP or GTP. It functioned efficiently at monovalent cation concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 200 mM. It was bound to ribosomes isolated from cells lysed in low salt buffers. However, it was eluted in active form from the ribosomes by exposing them to 0.3 M KCl. The enzyme rapidly degraded deproteinized, 32P-labeled histone mRNA prepared enzymatically."
https://openalex.org/W1572543545,"The mu and delta opiate receptors present in rat brain were measured independently during postnatal development. The numbers of delta receptors were almost undetectable at birth and increased substantially during the first few weeks, whereas the numbers of mu receptors remained relatively constant. Activation of either of these receptors caused inhibition of adenylate cyclase, but inhibition coupled to mu receptors was much smaller than that associated with delta receptors at all ages. Attempts to use pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation as an assay for the GTP-binding proteins Ni and No were hampered by the development of an NADase with age. However, specific antibodies directed against the alpha subunits of Ni or No allowed separate quantitation of these transducer proteins. Both increased with age. No is present at levels at least 5-fold higher than Ni in the adult rat brain. The N proteins are in vast excess over receptors and as such are unlikely to be limiting factors in receptor function. The data further suggest that the number of opiate receptors present throughout neonatal development is in excess over that required for optimal function."
https://openalex.org/W176011971,"A DNA topoisomerase has been purified from vaccinia virus cores. The native enzyme is composed of a single subunit of 32,000 daltons. The enzyme relaxes both positively and negatively supercoiled DNA in the absence of an energy cofactor. Enzymatic activity is stimulated by magnesium ions and inhibited by ATP, and during relaxation the topoisomerase changes the linking number of the DNA substrate by steps of one. Trapping of the covalent DNA-enzyme intermediate has been achieved, and analysis of the cleavage of duplex DNA by the enzyme reveals that it makes a single-strand break and forms a covalent bond through the 3'-end of the broken strand. Enzymatic activity and formation of the trapped intermediate are inhibited by the drugs novobiocin, coumermycin A1, and berenil. The virally encapsidated enzyme has novel properties but most closely resembles a eucaryotic type I topoisomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1570569355,"Leader peptidase is an enzyme of the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane which removes amino-terminal leader sequences from many secreted and membrane proteins. Three potential membrane-spanning segments exist in the first 98 amino acids of leader peptidase. We have characterized the topology of leader peptidase based on its sensitivity to protease digestion. Proteinase K and trypsin treatment of right-side-out inner membrane vesicles and spheroplasts yields protected fragments of approximately 80 and 105 amino acid residues, respectively. We have shown that both fragments are derived from the amino terminus of the protein and that the smaller protected peptide can be derived from the larger. Removal of the third potential membrane-spanning segment (residues 82-98) does not affect the size of the proteinase K-protected fragment but does reduce the size of the trypsin-protected peptide. Because the proteinase K-protected fragment is about 9000 daltons, is derived from the amino terminus of leader peptidase, and its size is not affected when amino acids 82-98 are removed from the protein, it must extend from the amino terminus to approximately residue 80. Likewise, the trypsin-protected fragment must extend from the amino terminus to about residue 105. These data suggest a model for the orientation of leader peptidase in which the second hydrophobic stretch (residues 62-76) spans the cytoplasmic membrane and the third hydrophobic stretch resides in the periplasmic space."
https://openalex.org/W1607449181,"We have chemically synthesized a DNA duplex of 757 base pairs which encodes the entire protein sequence of mature bacterio-opsin of Halobacterium halobium. The main aim of the synthesis was to facilitate site-specific mutagenesis in all parts of the gene by replacement of short restriction fragments by their counterparts containing the required nucleotide changes. Therefore, 30 unique restriction sites that are fairly evenly spaced were introduced in the synthetic DNA. A total of 28 oligonucleotides ranging in size from 21 to 69 nucleotides were synthesized corresponding to both strands. The entire gene was assembled from four synthetic fragments of 25, 268, 219, and 245 base pairs. The correctness of the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing the fragments as well as the complete gene. When expressed under the control of PL promoter in Escherichia coli, the synthetic and the native genes gave similar amounts of bacterio-opsin. Attempts to increase expression of the synthetic gene by introducing codons that are preferred in E. coli or by introduction of a synthetic transcription terminator were without significant effect."
https://openalex.org/W1608156350,"Phosphoinositides of human, rabbit, rat, and turkey erythrocytes were radiolabeled by incubation of intact cells with [32P]Pi. Guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and NaF, which are known activators of guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins, caused a large increase in [32P]inositol phosphate release from plasma membranes derived from turkey erythrocytes, but had no effect on inositol phosphate formation by plasma membranes prepared from the mammalian erythrocytes. High performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that inositol bisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate all increased by 20-30-fold during a 10-min incubation of turkey erythrocyte membranes with GTP gamma S. The increase in inositol phosphate formation was accompanied by a similar decrease in radioactivity in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). GTP gamma S increased inositol phosphate formation with a K0.5 of 600 nM; guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)trisphosphate was 50-75% as efficacious as GTP gamma S and expressed a K0.5 of 36 microM. Although GTP alone had little effect on inositol phosphate formation, it blocked GTP gamma S-stimulated inositol phosphate formation, as did guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). Turkey erythrocytes were also shown to express phosphatidylinositol synthetase activity in that incubation of cells with [3H] inositol resulted in incorporation of radiolabel into phosphatidylinositol, PIP, and PIP2. Incubation of membranes derived from [3H]inositol-labeled erythrocytes with GTP gamma S resulted in large increases in [3H] inositol phosphate formation and corresponding decreases in radiolabel in PIP and PIP2. The data suggest that, in contrast to mammalian erythrocytes, the turkey erythrocyte expresses a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that regulates phospholipase C, and as such, should provide a useful model system for furthering our understanding of hormonal regulation of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1658332654,"Excessive accumulation of collagen is the hallmark of several clinical conditions characterized by tissue fibrosis. Previously, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a structural analog of alpha-ketoglutarate and ascorbate, has been shown to inhibit the activity of purified prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of 4-hydroxyproline during intracellular biosynthesis of procollagen. In this study a hydrophobic modification, an ethyl ester, of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was tested for its effects on collagen synthesis and prolyl hydroxylase activity in human skin fibroblast cultures. The results indicated that 0.4 mM ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate markedly inhibited the synthesis of 4-hydroxyproline in normal cell cultures apparently as a result of reduced prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, and the synthesis and secretion of both type I and type III procollagens were markedly reduced. Control experiments indicated that the test compound did not affect the viability, proliferation, or plating efficiency of the cells, and it had little, if any, effect on the synthesis of noncollagenous proteins. Furthermore, determinations of type I and type III procollagen mRNA steady-state levels by slot-blot hybridizations suggested that the inhibition of procollagen production did not occur on the pretranslational level. Thus, ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate selectively reduced procollagen production in fibroblast cultures by inhibiting the post-translational synthesis of 4-hydroxyproline. Similar inhibition was also observed in keloid fibroblast cultures, demonstrating the potential applicability of ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, or other structural alpha-ketoglutarate or ascorbate analogs, for treatment of fibrotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1516590578,"In a cytosolic fraction derived from insulin-secreting RINm5F cells, the rate of conversion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4,5-P4) was half-maximally stimulated by 0.8 microM Ca2+ (Biden, T. J., and Wollheim, C. B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11931-11934). In the present study we show that after initial purification by anion exchange chromatography, the Ins-1,4,5-P3 kinase activity responsible for that conversion is stimulated by Ca2+-calmodulin, but not by Ca2+ alone. This is almost certainly due to a specific interaction of the enzyme and its activator since kinase activity was retained on a calmodulin-linked Sepharose 6B column in the presence of Ca2+ but eluted upon chelation of the cation. After this two-step purification, Ins-1,4,5-P3 kinase activity was maximally stimulated 5-fold by 10 microM calmodulin in the presence of 10(-5) M Ca2+, and 2 1/2-fold at 10(-6) M Ca2+. Under these conditions the minimum concentrations of calmodulin needed to stimulate activity were in the 10-50 nM range. At 10(-7) M Ca2+, calmodulin (up to 30 microM) was without effect. Stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 kinase activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W7) although the calmodulin antagonist had no effect on the residual activity seen at 10(-7) M Ca2+. These results strongly support our previous suggestion that alterations in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations play an important role in regulating the levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 and Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 during cellular stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1593381863,"We previously demonstrated a pathway for the metabolism of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) to inositol 3,4-bisphosphate (Ins(3,4)P2) in calf brain extracts. Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, a Mg2+-dependent, lithium ion-inhibited enzyme, specifically hydrolyzes Ins(1,3,4)P3 to Ins(3,4)P2 and Ins(1,4)P2 to Ins 4-P (Inhorn, R. C., Bansal, V. S., and Majerus, P. W. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 2170-2174). Now we have found an alternative pathway for the metabolism of Ins(1,3,4)P3 in crude calf brain extracts. Along this pathway, Ins(1,3,4)P3 is first converted to Ins(1,3)P2 which is further hydrolyzed to Ins 1-P. This pathway involves a 4-phosphatase and a 3-phosphatase which do not require Mg2+ and are not inhibited by lithium ions. A similar 4-phosphatase also degrades Ins(3,4)P2 to Ins 3-P. Three different inositol bisphosphates formed from calf brain supernatant are each further metabolized by a separate enzyme. The three inositol monophosphates, i.e. Ins 1-P, Ins 3-P, and Ins 4-P, are converted to inositol by inositol monophosphate phosphatase (Ackermann, K. E., Gish, B. G., Honchar, M. P., and Sherman, W. R. (1987) Biochem. J. 242, 517-524)."
https://openalex.org/W1605780295,"We have studied the ability of certain well-defined prokaryotic DNA sequences to act as specific termination signals for highly purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II. We used duplex DNA fragments modified to direct efficient and specific transcription of defined DNA templates to follow transcription with RNA polymerase alone in the absence of additional protein factors. Elongation of RNA chains by RNA polymerase II is processive through most DNA sequences. However, certain DNA sequences serve as effective terminators for RNA polymerase II; in this they resemble the terminators for the bacterial RNA polymerase. Several rho-independent bacterial terminators are also able to act as termination signals for RNA polymerase II. However, there is no apparent correlation between the efficiency of termination for the bacterial enzyme and that found for the calf thymus enzyme. One very efficient bacterial terminator (phage T7 early terminator) gives no termination with RNA polymerase II, and we have identified at least two sites that cause the eukaryotic enzyme to terminate but have no effect on transcription by the bacterial enzyme. Hence, the signals recognized as intrinsic termination sites for the two enzymes are substantially different. All of the sites that act as intrinsic terminators for RNA polymerase II contain a series of consecutive thymidine residues in the nontranscribed DNA strand (T-run), and the 3' end of the completed RNA normally lies within this sequence. It is plausible that the T-run is part of the signal for an RNA polymerase II termination site; however, there is no apparent correlation between the number of T residues and the efficiency of the terminator, suggesting that other sequence elements are required for, or modulate, termination. Several lines of evidence suggest that the formation of RNA secondary structures in the nascent transcript is not an essential element of the intrinsic RNA polymerase II termination signal."
https://openalex.org/W1597937768,"Sodium-proton antiporter activity can be modulated through changes Vmax and/or intracellular proton sensitivity of the antiporter. To characterize a parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced decrease in antiporter activity in a continuous renal cell line (opossum kidney cells), the extracellular sodium and intracellular proton dependence of amiloride-inhibitable 22Na uptake was studied. The Km for extracellular sodium at intracellular pH 6.32 was 28 mM and was unaltered by PTH, whereas the Vmax was decreased by 26%. When intracellular pH was set over the range 5.87-7.57 by the potassium-nigericin method, antiporter activity increased as intracellular pH decreased. Hill analysis revealed Hill coefficients of 1.25 and 1.01 and half-maximal antiporter activity at intracellular pH values of 6.90 and 6.35 for control and PTH-treated cells, respectively. PTH decreased the apparent Vmax at low pH by 15% and the intracellular pH at which Na+/H+ exchange is half-maximal by 0.55 pH units."

Biol. Chem. 261, 5104-5110). The purified enzyme appeared to contain equal amounts of two nonidentical proteins, with Mr of about 38,000 and 45,000. We have now separated and purified these proteins. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that each protein was homogeneous. The 45,000 protein contained the catalytic activity. Analysis by gel filtration chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation indicated that the 38,000 and 45,000 proteins in the purified cytidylyltransferase were independently associated with Triton X-100 micelles. The apparent Mr of the complexes suggested that a tetramer of each protein was bound to one Triton X-100 micelle. The isolated 45,000 catalytic protein had the same lipid requirement and kinetic properties as the purified cytidylyltransferase containing both proteins. Enzyme activity was stimulated to maximal values by phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing 9 mol % of either oleic acid, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylglycerol. The amino acid compositions of the isolated 38,000 and 45,000 proteins were distinctly different. Overall, the results suggested that a tetramer of the 45,000 protein possessed nearly optimal catalytic activity. A functional role of the 38,000 protein as part of a cytidylyltransferase enzyme complex could not be documented. However, the need for stabilizing concentrations of Triton X-100 in the purified enzyme preparation may have prevented the association of the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1553862381,"The DP region of the human major histocompatibility complex contains two alpha genes and two beta genes. The DP alpha 1 and beta 1 genes encode the expressed DP histocompatibility antigen molecule, while the DP alpha 2 and beta 2 genes are inactive in the haplotypes examined. Here we present the sequence of the two DP beta genes and of the expressed DP alpha 1 gene. Nucleotide sequence comparisons reveal a considerably greater degree of similarity between the two beta genes than between the two alpha genes. We propose that a duplication giving rise to the DP alpha gene pair evolutionarily preceded the corresponding DP beta gene duplication. We also propose, based on the orientation of other class II gene pairs, that the original DP molecule was encoded by the DP beta 1 and DP alpha 2 genes. At some stage during the evolution of the DP region both of the two pseudogenes appear to have been expressed."

(1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5886-5891). The rat parvalbumin transcription unit is 15.5 kilobase pairs in length and contains four introns. The first intron divides the 5'-nontranslated region, whereas the other three interrupt coding DNA. All intron/extron boundaries were sequenced as was 377 base pairs immediately 5' from the putative transcription initiation site. The promoter region contains eukaryotic regulatory homologies to the TATA box at -24 and CAAT box at -47 and -156. In addition, two doublets consisting of 11-base pair direct repeats exist in the promoter region. Parvalbumin binds two Ca2+, whereas many other members of the same superfamily bind four. Comparison of the genes that encode these proteins provides a strong confirmation of the hypothesis that parvalbumin evolved from an ancestral gene specifying a four-domain Ca2+-binding protein. The rat parvalbumin gene was also utilized to assign its human counterpart to chromosome 22 from data obtained by hybridization to DNA from a somatic cell hybrid panel. It was also used to isolate a 7.5-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment from a human chromosome 22 DNA library."
https://openalex.org/W1777591322,"Vanadate is known to inhibit several phosphatases including Na+, K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, and glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase. Inhibition presumably results because vanadium adopts a stable structure which resembles the transition state of phosphate during the reactions involving these enzymes. We performed experiments to further examine the effects of vanadate (VO3-4) on erythrocyte (red blood cells (RBC] glycolytic intermediates. RBC obtained from human subjects were centrifuged and washed with lactated Ringer's 5% dextrose. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the RBC revealed the characteristic peaks for the 3-phosphate and 2-phosphate of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and ATP. Incubation of RBC with 10(-6) M VO3-4 led to a disappearance of ATP and 2,3-DPG while the peak for Pi increased. By the end of 4 h over 90% of the VO3-4 had been reduced to VO2+ (vanadyl) in the RBC. The effects of 10(-4) M iodoacetamide and 10(-5) M ethacrynic acid, known inhibitors of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase that act by interactions with sulfhydryl groups (-SH) of the enzyme, were similar to those of VO3-4. Incubation with vanadyl did not affect the peaks for Pi, 2-DPG, or 3-DPG. Furthermore, using electron spin resonance we demonstrated that in the presence of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, VO3-4 is reduced to VO2+. The findings demonstrate that VO3-4 inhibits glycolysis at micromolar concentrations and that the ion is reduced to VO2+ in the cell. The similarity of the effect of VO3-4 to those of iodoacetamide and ethacrynic acid suggests that interactions with -SH groups is its mechanism of inhibition. Since under physiological conditions intracellular VO3-4 concentrations are in the micromolar range and may exist in oxidized and/or reduced forms, VO3-4 could regulate the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase through changes in the redox state of the enzyme rather than by substituting for the PO3-4 ion."
https://openalex.org/W1532523860,"The physicochemical properties of the iron-sulfur clusters present in the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase of Paracoccus denitrificans have been examined in the cytoplasmic membrane particles by redox potentiometry and EPR spectroscopy. Analogous to the iron-sulfur clusters present in the mitochondrial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, we have found two binuclear and three tetranuclear EPR detectable iron-sulfur clusters, namely, N-1a, N-1b, N-2, N-3, and N-4. In the bacterial system, the two binuclear clusters differ in line shape and in Em values; the cluster with more rhombic symmetry (gx,y,z = 1.918, 1.937, 2.029) has the Em7.0 value of -150 while the almost axial one (gx,y,z = 1.929, 1.941, 2.019) has Em7.0 of -270 mV. The Em of the former cluster is pH dependent (-60 mV/pH) as in the case of mammalian N-1a while the latter is pH independent as is the mammalian cluster N-1b. The pH-dependent P. denitrificans [2Fe-2S] cluster, which we have labeled N-1a, has an Em7.0 as high as that of N-2, in contrast to the mammalian N-1a. Thus N-1a is reducible with a physiological reductant, NADH in this bacterial system. The Em of the cluster N-2 is also pH dependent (Em7.0 = -130 mV) with a pK value near 7.7. The Em values of all other clusters exhibit no pH dependence as in the case of their mammalian counterparts. We have found that the cluster N-1a is the most labile component among the five iron-sulfur clusters and may give rise to variable relative spin concentrations and extremely low Em values due to the facile modifications of the microenvironment of the cluster. The P. denitrificans NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase provides a unique and useful site I model system where redox composition is similar to the mitochondrial enzyme but with fewer numbers of polypeptides (Yagi, T. (1986) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 250, 302-311)."
https://openalex.org/W1600119412,"The GTP-binding protein of Bufo marinus rod outer segments (ROS) is composed of 3 subunits: G alpha, 39,000; G beta, 36,000; and G gamma, approximately 6,500. A stepwise analysis of the GTP hydrolytic cycle (GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis, and GDP release) was facilitated by using purified subunits of the GTP-binding protein. When G alpha and G beta, gamma concentrations were held constant, the initial rate of guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma-s) binding to G alpha was dependent upon the amount of bleached rhodopsin present (as illuminated, urea-washed ROS disc membranes). When G alpha and the quantity of these membranes was held constant, the initial rate of GTP gamma-s binding to G alpha was markedly enhanced by increasing the amount of G beta, gamma. G beta preparations (free of G gamma) also stimulated the binding of GTP gamma-s to G alpha to the same extent as G beta, gamma preparations, suggesting that G gamma is not an essential component of the G beta, gamma-dependent stimulation of the rate of GTP gamma-s binding to G alpha. Nonlinear regression analysis revealed a single class of binding sites with an apparent stoichiometry of 1 mol of site/mol of G alpha under optimal binding conditions. Following GTP binding to G alpha, the GTP X G alpha complex dissociates from G beta, gamma which remains primarily bound to the ROS disc membranes. Moreover, while GTP remains in excess, the rates of GTP hydrolysis exhibited saturation in the presence of increasing amounts of G beta, gamma. Nonlinear regression analysis of these data argues against a direct role for G beta, gamma in the hydrolysis of GTP. Thus, both topologic and kinetic data support the concept that GTP hydrolysis is carried out by G alpha alone. After hydrolysis of GTP, the GDP X G alpha complex returned to the ROS disc membrane when G beta, gamma was present on the membrane surface, in the presence and absence of light. Without guanine nucleotides GDP release occurred in the presence of illuminated ROS disc membranes and G beta, gamma. Guanine nucleotides (GTP gamma-s approximately equal to GTP approximately equal to guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate greater than GDP) could effectively displace GDP from G alpha under these conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

(1986) J. Mol. Biol. 188, 579-593). Five RNAs that lacked poly(A), including histone, were degraded rapidly in vitro. Polyadenylated histone mRNA was degraded at least 10-fold more slowly than unmodified histone mRNA. Double-stranded RNA and DNA were very stable. Single-stranded DNA was degraded approximately 20-fold more slowly than single-stranded, non-polyadenylated RNA, and RNA with a 3' phosphoryl group was degraded more slowly than RNA with a 3'-hydroxyl group. Uncapped RNAs were degraded rapidly in the unfractionated system but were stable in reactions containing a ribosomal high salt wash extract. Therefore, the exonuclease activity released from ribosomes by high salt extraction was separated from the enzyme(s) that degraded uncapped RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1595910219,"The regulatory (R) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was expressed in Escherichia coli by engineering the gene for yeast R, BCY1, into an E. coli expression vector that contained a promoter from phage T7. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to create an NdeI restriction site at the natural ATG of the yeast R. This facilitated construction of the T7 expression vector so that the sequence of the protein produced was identical to the natural R subunit. Yeast R was highly expressed in a soluble form. 20 mg of purified yeast R was obtained from 4 liters of E. coli. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that the expressed protein began with the natural sequence. 60% of the molecules contained an N-terminal methionine, and 40% initiated with valine, the second amino acid of yeast R. The protein produced in E. coli migrated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel with an Mr of 52,000. The yeast R bound 2 mol of cAMP/mol of R monomer with a Kd of 76 nM. The protein was treated with urea to remove bound cAMP. Sedimentation values before and after the urea treatment were identical (s20,w = 5.1). Addition of purified R subunit to a preparation of yeast C subunit (TPK1) rendered catalytic activity cAMP-dependent with an activity ratio of 4.6. The yeast R was autophosphorylated by yeast C to a level of 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of R monomer. By these criteria, the R subunit produced in E. coli was structurally and functionally identical to the natural yeast R subunit and similar to mammalian type II R subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1491873458,"Interferon-induced 2',5'-oligoadenylates are transiently produced during viral infection and are believed to play a role in the interferon-mediated inhibition of replication of at least some viruses. 2',5'-Oligoadenylates must be catabolized but are resistant to degradation by most known ribonucleases. A 2'-phosphodiesterase that degrades 2',5'-oligoadenylates was purified 1500-fold from a low speed homogenate of bovine spleen by precipitation at pH 5.2, ammonium sulfate fractionation, differential ultrafiltration, and successive chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, hydroxylapatite, and a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono P column. No other 2-5A-degrading activity was observed during the purification procedure. The molecular mass of the enzyme estimated by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 65,000. The enzyme is distinct from bovine spleen phosphodiesterase II. The 2'-phosphodiesterase cleaves 2',5'- and 3',5'-linked oligonucleotides, as well as branched oligoadenylate, A(2'pA)(3'pA), but appears to be most active on 3',5'-oligoribonucleotides. The enzyme cleaves 5'-AMP from the 2' terminus of 2',5'-oligoadenylates and appears to require a free 2' terminus and a 3'-oxygen on the penultimate nucleotide. Substrate length, 5'-phosphorylation, and base composition do not appear to be critical factors in determining enzyme activity. The effects of pH, Mg2+, Mn2+, EDTA, phosphate, 2-mercaptoethanol, and N-ethylmaleimide are also described. This enzyme may be involved in the catabolism of the interferon-induced 2',5'-oligoadenylates and other 2',5'-linked RNAs in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1597536177,"The ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome bc1) complex from Paracoccus denitrificans exhibits a thermodynamically stable ubisemiquinone radical detectable by EPR spectroscopy. The radical is centered at g = 2.004, is sensitive to antimycin, and has a midpoint potential at pH 8.5 of +42 mV. These properties are very similar to those of the stable ubisemiquinone (Qi) previously characterized in the cytochrome bc1 complexes of mitochondria. The micro-environment of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster in the Paracoccus cytochrome bc1 complex changes in parallel with the redox state of the ubiquinone pool. This change is manifested as shifts in the gx, gy, and gz values of the iron-sulfur cluster EPR signal from 1.80, 1.89, and 2.02 to 1.76, 1.90, and 2.03, respectively, as ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol. The spectral shift is accompanied by a broadening of the signal and follows a two electron reduction curve, with a midpoint potential at pH 8.5 of +30 mV. A hydroxy analogue of ubiquinone, UHDBT, which inhibits respiration in the cytochrome bc1 complex, shifts the gx, gy, and gz values of the iron-sulfur cluster EPR signal to 1.78, 1.89, and 2.03, respectively, and raises the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur cluster at pH 7.5 from +265 to +320 mV. These changes in the micro-environment of the Paracoccus Rieske iron-sulfur cluster are like those elicited in mitochondria. These results indicate that the cytochrome bc1 complex of P. denitrificans has a binding site for ubisemiquinone and that this site confers properties on the bound ubisemiquinone similar to those in mitochondria. In addition, the line shape of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster changes in response to the oxidation-reduction status of ubiquinone, and the midpoint of the iron-sulfur cluster increases in the presence of a hydroxyquinone analogue of ubiquinone. The latter results are also similar to those observed in the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex. However, unlike the mitochondrial complexes, which contain eight to 11 polypeptides and are thought to contain distinct quinone binding proteins, the Paracoccus cytochrome bc1 complex contains only three polypeptide subunits, cytochromes b, c1, and iron-sulfur protein. The ubisemiquinone binding site and the site at which ubiquinone and/or ubiquinol bind to affect the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster in Paracoccus thus exist in the absence of any distinct quinone binding proteins and must be composed of domains contributed by the cytochromes and/or iron-sulfur protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497322979,"The present study demonstrates that two forms of the alpha catalytic subunit of the Na,K-ATPase are present in rat heart and originate from cardiomyocytes. They were resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after reduction and alkylation of the sulfhydryl groups. The two forms were identified on immunoblots using two specific antisera against either the alpha subunit from Bufo marinus kidney and the alpha and beta subunits from lamb kidney. Comparison of the two forms to the alkylated Na,K-ATPase from rat kidney (containing one catalytic subunit) and from rat brain (containing alpha and alpha + subunits) suggested that, in rat cardiac myocytes, the form with a fast migration rate (alpha F) corresponds to the alpha subunit of low ouabain affinity and the one with a slow migration rate (alpha S), to a subunit of high ouabain affinity. Thus, the existence of two isoforms of the catalytic subunit in cardiac myocytes accounts well for the biphasic ouabain inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase activity and for the biphasic inotropic responsiveness to cardiac glycosides of the rat heart."
https://openalex.org/W1557896520,"A short single-stranded tail on one end of an otherwise duplex DNA molecule enables recA protein, in the presence of ATP and MgCl2, to form a complex with the DNA which extends into the duplex portion of the molecule. Nuclease protection studies at a concentration of MgCl2 which permits homologous pairing showed that cleavage by restriction endonucleases at sites throughout the duplex region was inhibited, whereas digestion by DNase I was not affected. These results indicate that recA protein binds to the duplex portion of tailed DNA allowing access by DNase I to a random sample of the many sites at which it cleaves, but providing limited protection of the relatively rare restriction sites. Electron microscopy revealed that the recA nucleoprotein complex with duplex DNA is indeed a segmented or interrupted filament that, with time, extends further from the single-stranded tail into the duplex region. recA protein binding extended into the duplex region more rapidly for duplexes with 5' tails than for those with 3' tails. These observations show that recA protein translocates from a single-stranded region into duplex DNA in the form of a segmented filament by a mechanism that is not strongly polarized."

https://openalex.org/W1507651469,"Limited treatment of native pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (50 microM enzyme subunit) with [14C]N-ethylmaleimide (100 microM) at 30 degrees C, pH 7.5, in the presence of AMP (200 microM) results in the modification of 1 reactive cysteine residue/enzyme subunit. The N-ethylmaleimide-modified fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase has a functional catalytic site but is no longer inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme derivative also exhibits decreased affinity toward Mg2+. The presence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate during the modification protects the enzyme against the loss of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibition. Moreover, the modified enzyme is inhibited by monovalent cations, as previously reported (Reyes, A., Hubert, E., and Slebe, J.C. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 127, 373-379), and does not show inhibition by high substrate concentrations. A comparison of the kinetic properties of native and N-ethylmaleimide-modified fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase reveals differences in some properties but none is so striking as the complete loss of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate sensitivity. The results demonstrate that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate interacts with a specific allosteric site on fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and they also indicate that high levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibit the enzyme by binding to this fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosteric site."
https://openalex.org/W1543109809,"Abstract Psoralens in combination with ultraviolet light are potent modulators of epidermal cell growth and differentiation. Responsive cell types contain specific, saturable, high-affinity binding sites for the psoralens. These binding sites become covalently modified by the psoralen molecule following ultraviolet light exposure. In the present studies the psoralen receptor, labeled with [3H]8-methoxypsoralen, was visualized in the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane fractions of HeLa cells following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The receptor had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 22,000 daltons and was shown to be sensitive to protease, but not nuclease treatment. The radiolabeled receptor could not be visualized in nuclear extracts of cells. Covalent binding of the radioligand to the receptor protein was inhibited by excess unlabeled 8-methoxypsoralen, indicating that covalent psoralen-receptor binding was saturable. In addition, the covalently modified receptor was found to persist in cells for over 5 h. The presence of a cellular protein that exhibits specific affinity for the psoralens and becomes photoalkylated by these compounds, together with previous data showing that the psoralens have direct effects on the cell surface membranes, supports our model that some of the biological effects of photoactivated psoralens are receptor-mediated."
https://openalex.org/W1502010596,"Amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the Na+/H+ antiport. Inhibition is generally competitive with extracellular Na+ and therefore believed to result from binding to the outward-facing transport site. It is not known whether amiloride can interact with the internal aspect of the antiport. This question was addressed by trapping the drug inside resealed dog red cell ghosts. The antiport, which is quiescent in resting ghosts, was activated by acid-loading the cytoplasm. This was accomplished by exchanging extracellular Cl- for internal HCO-3 through capnophorin, the endogenous anion exchanger. The activity of the Na+/H+ antiport was detected as an increase in cell volume, resulting from the net osmotic gain associated with coupled Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO-3 exchange, or as the uptake of 22Na+. Intracellular amiloride, at concentrations in excess of 100 microM, failed to inhibit Na+/H+ exchange. This is approximately 10 times higher than the concentration required for half-maximal inhibition when amiloride is added externally. Independent experiments demonstrated that failure of internal amiloride to inhibit exchange was not due to leakage of the inhibitor, to differences in pH, or to binding or inactivation of amiloride by the soluble contents. It was concluded that the antiport is functionally asymmetric with respect to amiloride. This implies that the transport site undergoes a conformational change upon translocation across the membrane or, alternatively, that a second site required for amiloride binding is only accessible from the outside."
https://openalex.org/W1588802404,"We describe the construction and characterization of an oligonucleotide Holliday junction analog and characterize its interaction with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae endonuclease that cleaves Holliday junctions. A Holliday junction analog containing four duplex arms and 54 base pairs was constructed by annealing four unique synthetic oligonucleotides. Mixing curve analysis showed that the complex contained a 1:1:1:1 mol ratio of the four unique sequence strands. In addition, a linear duplex with a sequence identical to two of the junction arms was also constructed for use as a control fragment. High resolution gel exclusion chromatography was used to purify and characterize the synthetic junction. The synthetic Holliday junction was found to be a specific inhibitor of a S. cerevisiae enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of Holliday junctions. Under standard cleavage conditions, 50% inhibition was observed at a synthetic Holliday junction to substrate ratio of 7/1, whereas no inhibition by linear duplex was observed at molar ratios in excess of 150/1. Kinetic analysis showed that Holliday junction was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction and had an apparent Ki = 2.5 nM, although the mode of inhibition was complex. The synthetic Holliday junction was not a substrate for the enzyme, but was found to form a specific complex with the enzyme as evidenced by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis DNA binding assays."
https://openalex.org/W1554324789,"We have studied the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger during dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced maturation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. 22Na uptake was measured in cells preloaded with Li+ or NH+4 in order to specifically activate the Na+/H+ exchanger. Measurement of the rate of uptake as a function of sodium concentration revealed a decrease in Km for Na+ from 38 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 1 mM after 20-24-h treatment with Me2SO. Vmax was not changed significantly. Inhibition of the exchanger by dimethylamiloride (DMA) and by acidic external pH was similar in treated and untreated cells. Thus it is unlikely that the Na+ binding site is altered. A change, however, was observed in the regulation of the exchanger by intracellular pH. In control cells maximal stimulation of the Na+ uptake was observed when the intracellular pH decreased from 7.25 to 7.00. In Me2SO-treated cells the 22Na uptake at intracellular pH 7.00 was greater than in the control and continued to increase as the intracellular pH was adjusted below 7.00, down to 6.75. This suggests that the Na+/H+ exchanger in Me2SO-treated cells is altered structurally in its allosteric H+ binding site. The appearance of this modified exchanger preceded by a period of days the appearance of a functional property characteristic of mature granulocytes, that is, the capability to produce superoxide, suggesting that the modified exchanger may be required for the expression of the mature phenotype. A second modification, a decrease in the Vmax of the 22Na uptake, occurred after 2 days treatment with Me2SO. This reduction may reflect a decrease in the number of functioning exchangers per cell."

Subsequent transport of the glycoprotein was also not affected. Although the internalized signals functioned with wild-type efficiency in vivo, membrane insertion in vitro (as determined by proteolysis protection assays), signal cleavage, and glycosylation were only achieved when the amino-terminal presequences were short."
https://openalex.org/W1488408506,"Nicotinamide deamidase (YNDase) has been purified from yeast through the use of a six-step procedure that includes molecular-sieve high performance liquid chromatography. The final preparation was homogeneous by the criteria of sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and the enzyme specific activity was determined to be 175 mumol of nicotinate formed per min/mg enzyme. Gel electrophoresis and molecular-sieve high performance liquid chromatography were employed also to characterize YNDase as a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 34,000. A Km value for nicotinamide of 33 microM was determined for the deamidase activity at pH 6, and a pH range for optimal stability of 6-8.5 was established for this enzyme. The YNDase activity was also examined over a pH range at several substrate concentrations and both the log Vmax and log Vmax/Km plots versus pH suggested that a protonated amino acid residue with an apparent pKb value of 7.8 was essential to this activity. During an in vitro assay of the YNDase-catalyzed formation of nicotinate, ammonia was generated and detected chemically. Inhibition of the YNDase activity by nicotinaldehyde suggested the presence of either an essential lysine (Schiff's base formation) or cysteine residue (thiohemiacetal intermediate) at the YNDase active site. The relatively large value of the nicotinaldehyde inhibition constant (Ki = 68 microM), the observation that this analogue is a noncompetitive inhibitor of nicotinate formation, and the fact that this inhibition can be rendered irreversible through incubation with sodium borohydride, indicates that a Schiff's base intermediate is more likely to occur upon incubation of YNDase with nicotinaldehyde. However, YNDase is inactivated completely and irreversibly by N-ethylmaleimide at pH 6, and the enzyme is protected against this modification by either nicotinamide or nicotinate. These results suggest that both nicotinate and nicotinamide bind to YNDase, even though the enzymatic reaction is essentially irreversible, and that a cysteine residue may be present at the YNDase active site."
https://openalex.org/W1584261932,"The reoxidation of reduced yeast Complex III by oxidants believed to react with cytochrome c1 exhibited multiple phases for both cytochrome c1 and the cytochromes b; the reoxidation of cytochrome b, but not cytochrome c1, was markedly slowed by the presence of antimycin. The data are consistent with the Q-cycle or any other scheme which proposes a branched path for electron transport between the cytochrome b centers and the endogenous Q6, provided certain constraints are relaxed. The reoxidation of the endogenous quinone proceeded at a rate comparable to that of the rapidly reacting cytochrome b and appeared to be complete within 100 ms. Removal of the endogenous quinone did not change the rate or extent of reoxidation of any of the heme centers, demonstrating that quinone is not required for electron transport between cytochromes b and the iron-sulfur cluster. This result is inconsistent with the requirements of the Q-cycle. Funiculosin completely inhibited the reoxidation of cytochrome b whereas the reoxidation of cytochrome c1 exhibited simple first-order kinetics in the presence of this inhibitor, implying that the iron-sulfur cluster is on the direct path of electron transfer from cytochrome b to cytochrome c1. Potent inhibition of cytochrome b oxidation was also observed with myxothiazol and mucidin. The reaction of reduced Complex III with Q1 also exhibited multiple phases in the oxidation of the cytochrome b centers; these phases were unaffected by the presence of myxothiazol. Addition of antimycin, or removal of the endogenous quinone, eliminated the rapid phases; only one of the cytochrome b centers was oxidized under these conditions. Epr showed that it is the low-potential cytochrome b that is the species rapidly oxidized."
https://openalex.org/W1652326051,"In a crude membrane preparation of rat 7315c cells, GTP was found to enhance thyrotropin-releasing hormone- (TRH) stimulated inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation with a potency of 0.97 +/- 0.1 microM. TRH stimulation of IP3 formation was inhibited by high GDP concentrations. Neither nucleotide had any effect in the absence of TRH. 5'-Guanosine gamma-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) stimulated IP3 formation in the absence of TRH; the apparent affinity of GTP gamma S was 0.16 +/- 0.05 microM. GTP blocked GTP gamma S stimulation of IP3 formation in a concentration-dependent manner. The apparent affinity of GTP for the site of action shared by GTP gamma S was calculated to be 0.98 +/- 0.3 microM. TRH was able to reverse inhibition of GTP gamma S-stimulated IP3 formation by GTP but could not reverse inhibition by GDP. A lag in the rate of IP3 formation in response to GTP gamma S was abolished by addition of TRH. These data support the proposal that activation of the TRH receptor enhances turnover of guanine nucleotides at the binding protein coupling the receptor to phospholipase C. In addition, GTP gamma S diminished high affinity [3H]Me-TRH binding. The potency of GTP gamma S at decreasing [3H]Me-TRH binding was 0.092 +/- 0.03 microM. GTP gamma S (0.1 microM) decreased the affinity of the TRH receptor for [3H]Me-TRH from 2 to 100 nM. Maximally effective concentrations of GTP gamma S, Gpp(NH)p, GTP, and GDP decreased specific [3H]Me-TRH binding by 80%. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (30 ng/ml for 24 h) failed to affect TRH receptor affinity or the potency or efficacy of GTP gamma S in diminishing [3H]Me-TRH binding, supporting the identification of Gp (a GTP-binding protein associated with phospholipase C and Ca2+-mobilizing receptors) as distinct from Gi (an inhibitory GTP-binding protein). In contrast to its lack of effect on TRH receptor binding, 3-h pertussis toxin treatment decreased agonist affinity of the mu-opiate receptor and abolished the ability of GTP gamma S to shift the affinity of the mu-opiate receptor for its agonist. The affinities calculated for GTP, GDP, GTP gamma S, and Gpp (NH)p for the G-protein regulating receptor affinity and IP3 formation are nearly identical for each guanine nucleotide tested, suggesting the same G-protein regulates both activities."

Biochemical studies on the role of gene 18 protein in concatemer processing and DNA packaging have been hampered by its low level of expression of gene 18 during T7 infections. We have cloned gene 18 on a plasmid downstream from the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter controlled by the temperature-sensitive lambda repressor encoded by c 1857. Thermal induction leads to the expression of the 10,000-Da gene 18 protein to the extent of approximately 10% of the total protein after 2 h. The overexpressed gene 18 protein is susceptible to proteolytic degradation, a condition that can be alleviated by expression in an Escherichia coli strain carrying the lon100 deletion which reduces production of protease La. Extracts of induced cells will complement an extract of T7-infected cells lacking gene 18 protein for packaging of exogenous T7 DNA. The assay has been used to monitor the purification of gene 18 protein to essential homogeneity. The identity of the purified protein has been confirmed by sequencing of the N terminus. Gel filtration analysis suggests that the native protein is an octomer. Treatment of gene 18 protein with 3 M guanidine hydrochloride denatures it to a monomer. Removal of the denaturing agent by dialysis regenerates the octomeric structure and the ability to complement packaging extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1527274988,"A tyrosine-specific protein kinase immunologically related to pp60c-src, the cellular homolog of the Rous sarcoma virus-transforming protein, was expressed at elevated levels in the electric organ of the electric eel Electrophorus electricus. The electric organ kinase phosphorylated antibodies reactive with pp60c-src at tyrosine residues in immune complex protein kinase assays and was associated with electric organ membranes enriched in acetylcholine receptors. The protein recognized by anti-pp60c-src antibodies was phosphorylated in endogenous membrane phosphorylation reactions and was shown to have a relative molecular mass of 57 kDa by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In immune complex protein kinase assays the 57-kDa protein was phosphorylated at threonine by a distinct threonine kinase from the electric organ. The tyrosine kinase was purified 844-fold from electric organ membranes by chromatography on omega-aminohexyl agarose, phosphocellulose, and casein-Sepharose. Threonine kinase activity in immunoprecipitates was not observed in the tyrosine kinase fractions after the first step. Incubation of the casein Sepharose fraction with [gamma-32P]ATP-Mn2+ in solution resulted in phosphorylation of only the 57-kDa protein. Phosphorylation occurred solely at tyrosine, suggesting that the kinase is capable of autophosphorylation. The structural and functional properties of the 57-kDa electric organ kinase indicate that the 57-kDa electric organ protein is a member of the src subfamily of tyrosine kinases and is closely related to pp60c-src."
https://openalex.org/W2129765234,"The kinetics of reduction of the cytochrome and quinone constituents of yeast complex III by the substrate homolog Q1H2 have been measured under a variety of conditions. The maximum rates of reduction of cytochromes b and c1 and of the endogenous Q6 by Q1H2 were sufficiently fast to support the Vmax for the reduction of cytochrome c by this substrate. The absorbance at 562 nm showed an initial increase which was subsequently followed by a decrease. This decrease was synchronous with the appearance of reduced cytochrome c1 and is interpreted as reflecting the absorbance contribution of c1 at 562 nm under conditions where the steady state level of the b cytochromes is constant. Prereduction of c1 and the Fe/S cluster did not affect the initial very rapid reduction of b, but the second phase was eliminated. Antimycin abolished the very rapid rate of reduction of cytochrome b in untreated complex III and completely inhibited the reduction of cytochrome b in complex III in which c1 and the Fe/S cluster had been prereduced. However, the reduction of the endogenous quinone was essentially unaffected by these treatments. Antimycin had no effect on the reduction of c1. Funiculosin also suppressed the very rapid reduction of b while both myxothiazol and 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole did not modify this phase of the reaction; no secondary decrease in absorbance was observed in the presence of any of these inhibitors. Most of the observed kinetic changes could be reproduced by simulation of the Q-cycle; simple linear and branched schemes were unable to reproduce the data."
https://openalex.org/W1517356785,"The purified RNA polymerase complex of vesicular stomatitis virus required added thiols for maximal activity, whereas polymerase activity from whole disrupted virions did not. Maximal activity of the purified polymerase complex required greater than or equal to 1 mM added dithiothreitol. The polymerase was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at 0 degree C, with k2 = 528 +/- 26 M-1 min-1. Activity was recovered by addition of L protein, but not N or NS, to the NEM-inactivated complex, indicating that the NEM-sensitive group was present on the L protein. Nucleoside triphosphates protected the enzyme against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. ATP was most effective, with KD = 0.58 +/- 0.07 mM, a value close to the Km of ATP reported previously for initiation of RNA synthesis. dATP was nearly as effective, and GTP was slightly less effective than ATP. Non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP protected weakly, whereas ADP and pyrimidine triphosphates gave very poor, but still measurable, protection. The ATP binding site thus identified differs from the protein kinase-associated ATP binding site identified on L protein by Sanchez et al. (Sanchez, A., De, B.P., and Banerjee, A. K. (1985) J. Gen. Virol. 66, 1025-1036) in having a substantially lower affinity for ATP. Two putative ATP binding sites were identified in the L protein amino acid sequence, but none were found in the N or NS sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1558492944,"The amino-terminal domain of a eukaryotic signal peptide, from bovine parathyroid hormone, was altered by in vitro mutagenesis of the cDNA. The function of internalized signal sequence mutants and of deletion mutants was assayed using an in vitro translation-translocation system. The addition of 11 amino acids to the NH2 terminus of the signal peptide did not prevent normal processing of the precursor protein, whereas a 23-amino acid extension blocked processing. These data suggest that the NH2-terminal sequences of internal signal peptides must be permissive of the signal function. Deletion of 6 NH2-terminal amino acids from the signal peptide had no effect on its cleavage by microsomal membranes, but removal of 10 or 13 amino acids, including all charged residues prior to the hydrophobic core, prevented processing. For both the extension and deletion mutations, processed proteins were protected from proteolytic digestion, whereas unprocessed forms were not, which indicated that the unprocessed mutant proteins were not translocated across the microsomal membrane. Translation of both the extension and deletion translocation-deficient mutants was arrested by signal recognition particle, and salt-washed microsomal membranes reversed the translational arrest. These data demonstrate that the NH2-terminal domain is not required for the interaction of signal recognition particle with the signal peptide or with signal recognition particle receptor, but is required for formation of a maximally translocation-competent complex with the microsomal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1573529421,"The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 64D1 was found to inhibit cAMP binding by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) from Escherichia coli (Li, X.-M., and Krakow, J. S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4378-4383). CRP is relatively resistant to attack by the Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin whereas both mAb 64D1-CRP and cAMP-CRP are attacked by these proteases yielding N-terminal core fragments. The fragment patterns resulting from proteolysis of mAb 64D1-CRP and cAMP-CRP differ indicating that the CRP in each complex is in a different conformation. The data presented indicate that the preferred conformation of the antigenic site for mAb 64D1 is present in unliganded CRP. Binding of mAb 64D1 to CRP is inhibited at high cAMP concentration. Formation of a stable cAMP-CRP-lac P+-RNA polymerase open promoter complex resistant to dissociation by mAb 64D1 occurs at a much lower cAMP concentration. The observed increase in resistance to mAb 64D1 may reflect a possible conformational change in CRP effected by contact with RNA polymerase in the open promoter complex."
