https://openalex.org/W2040027262,"Available methods for differentiating human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) into neurons are often cumbersome, slow, and variable. Alternatively, human fibroblasts can be directly converted into induced neuronal (iN) cells. However, with present techniques conversion is inefficient, synapse formation is limited, and only small amounts of neurons can be generated. Here, we show that human ESCs and iPSCs can be converted into functional iN cells with nearly 100% yield and purity in less than 2 weeks by forced expression of a single transcription factor. The resulting ES-iN or iPS-iN cells exhibit quantitatively reproducible properties independent of the cell line of origin, form mature pre- and postsynaptic specializations, and integrate into existing synaptic networks when transplanted into mouse brain. As illustrated by selected examples, our approach enables large-scale studies of human neurons for questions such as analyses of human diseases, examination of human-specific genes, and drug screening."

Conventional wisdom has held that ice shelves around Antarctica lose mass mostly by iceberg calving, but recently it has become increasingly clear that melting by a warming ocean may also be important. Rignot et al. (p. 266 , published 13 June) present detailed glaciological estimates of ice-shelf melting around the entire continent of Antarctica, which show that basal melting accounts for as much mass loss as does calving."
https://openalex.org/W2161853532,"Targeting genetically encoded tools for neural circuit dissection to relevant cellular populations is a major challenge in neurobiology. We developed an approach, targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP), to obtain genetic access to neurons that were activated by defined stimuli. This method utilizes mice in which the tamoxifen-dependent recombinase CreER(T2) is expressed in an activity-dependent manner from the loci of the immediate early genes Arc and Fos. Active cells that express CreER(T2) can only undergo recombination when tamoxifen is present, allowing genetic access to neurons that are active during a time window of less than 12 hr. We show that TRAP can provide selective access to neurons activated by specific somatosensory, visual, and auditory stimuli and by experience in a novel environment. When combined with tools for labeling, tracing, recording, and manipulating neurons, TRAP offers a powerful approach for understanding how the brain processes information and generates behavior."

For several NLR family members, activation results in relief from autoinhibition, oligomerization, and the recruitment of signaling components that together make up the inflammasome, a large multiprotein complex. The inflammasome protects the host by inducing cell death and cytokine secretion. The specific molecular mechanisms that regulate NLR activation and inhibition, however, are not well understood. Hu et al. (p. 172 , published online 13 June) report the crystal structure of autoinhibited NLR family member NLRC4, which reveals the domains that are critical for interaction with adenosine diphosphate to keep NLRC4 in its inactive state and the domains that mediate oligomerization of the protein upon activation."

https://openalex.org/W1988135991,"Although the cheetah is recognised as the fastest land animal, little is known about other aspects of its notable athleticism, particularly when hunting in the wild. Here we describe and use a new tracking collar of our own design, containing a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial measurement units, to capture the locomotor dynamics and outcome of 367 predominantly hunting runs of five wild cheetahs in Botswana. A remarkable top speed of 25.9 m s−1 (58 m.p.h. or 93 km h−1) was recorded, but most cheetah hunts involved only moderate speeds. We recorded some of the highest measured values for lateral and forward acceleration, deceleration and body-mass-specific power for any terrestrial mammal. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed locomotor information on the hunting dynamics of a large cursorial predator in its natural habitat. A novel tracking collar provides highly precise location, speed and acceleration data from 367 runs by five cheetahs in the wild; although a top speed of 58 m.p.h. was reported, few runs were above 45 m.p.h. with the average run around 31 m.p.h., and hunting success depended on grip, manoeuvrability and muscle power rather than outright speed. The cheetah is widely recognized as the fastest animal on land, with a reported top speed of 29 metres per second. However, few precise measurements have been made and only rarely have speeds faster than racing greyhounds (18 m s−1) been recorded. Now a team from the Royal Veterinary College, UK, working with the Botswana Predator Conservation Trust, has used custom-built tracking collars containing GPS and inertial measurement units to capture the locomotor dynamics of cheetahs hunting in the wild. The top speed observed was 25.9 m s−1 (93 kilometres per hour). Most hunts involved only moderate speeds, their success relying on a combination of power, acceleration and agility."
https://openalex.org/W1978309461,"Atomic and single-molecule junctions represent the ultimate limit to the miniaturization of electrical circuits. They are also ideal platforms to test quantum transport theories that are required to describe charge and energy transfer in novel functional nanodevices. Recent work has successfully probed electric and thermoelectric phenomena in atomic-scale junctions. However, heat dissipation and transport in atomic-scale devices remain poorly characterized due to experimental challenges. Here, using custom-fabricated scanning probes with integrated nanoscale thermocouples, we show that heat dissipation in the electrodes of molecular junctions, whose transmission characteristics are strongly dependent on energy, is asymmetric, i.e. unequal and dependent on both the bias polarity and the identity of majority charge carriers (electrons vs. holes). In contrast, atomic junctions whose transmission characteristics show weak energy dependence do not exhibit appreciable asymmetry. Our results unambiguously relate the electronic transmission characteristics of atomic-scale junctions to their heat dissipation properties establishing a framework for understanding heat dissipation in a range of mesoscopic systems where transport is elastic. We anticipate that the techniques established here will enable the study of Peltier effects at the atomic scale, a field that has been barely explored experimentally despite interesting theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the experimental advances described here are also expected to enable the study of heat transport in atomic and molecular junctions, which is an important and challenging scientific and technological goal that has remained elusive."

https://openalex.org/W2020470595,"Neural networks are more than the sum of their parts, but the properties of those parts are nonetheless important. For instance, neuronal properties affect the degree to which neurons receiving common input will spike synchronously, and whether that synchrony will propagate through the network. Stimulus-evoked synchrony can help or hinder network coding depending on the type of code. In this Perspective, we describe how spike initiation dynamics influence neuronal input-output properties, how those properties affect synchronization, and how synchronization affects network coding. We propose that synchronous and asynchronous spiking can be used to multiplex temporal (synchrony) and rate coding and discuss how pyramidal neurons would be well suited for that task."
https://openalex.org/W1971368203,"On the Kiritimati atoll, several lakes exhibit microbial mat-formation under different hydrochemical conditions. Some of these lakes trigger microbialite formation such as Lake 21, which is an evaporitic, hypersaline lake (salinity of approximately 170‰). Lake 21 is completely covered with a thick multilayered microbial mat. This mat is associated with the formation of decimeter-thick highly porous microbialites, which are composed of aragonite and gypsum crystals. We assessed the bacterial and archaeal community composition and its alteration along the vertical stratification by large-scale analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the nine different mat layers. The surface layers are dominated by aerobic, phototrophic, and halotolerant microbes. The bacterial community of these layers harbored Cyanobacteria (Halothece cluster), which were accompanied with known phototrophic members of the Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria. In deeper anaerobic layers more diverse communities than in the upper layers were present. The deeper layers were dominated by Spirochaetes, sulfate-reducing bacteria (Deltaproteobacteria), Chloroflexi (Anaerolineae and Caldilineae), purple non-sulfur bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria), purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiales), anaerobic Bacteroidetes (Marinilabiacae), Nitrospirae (OPB95), Planctomycetes and several candidate divisions. The archaeal community, including numerous uncultured taxonomic lineages, generally changed from Euryarchaeota (mainly Halobacteria and Thermoplasmata) to uncultured members of the Thaumarchaeota (mainly Marine Benthic Group B) with increasing depth."

The mechanisms of ovulation have been studied extensively, with the hypothalamicpituitary axis serving as a key player in its regulation. Hasuwa et al.

https://openalex.org/W2055969447,"A key function of the nucleus accumbens is to promote vigorous reward seeking, but the corresponding neural mechanism has not been identified despite many years of research. Here, we study cued flexible approach behavior, a form of reward seeking that strongly depends on the accumbens, and we describe a robust, single-cell neural correlate of behavioral vigor in the excitatory response of accumbens neurons to reward-predictive cues. Well before locomotion begins, this cue-evoked excitation predicts both the movement initiation latency and the speed of subsequent flexible approach responses, but not those of stereotyped, inflexible responses. Moreover, the excitation simultaneously signals the subject's proximity to the approach target, a signal that appears to mediate greater response vigor on trials that begin with the subject closer to the target. These results demonstrate a neural mechanism for response invigoration whereby accumbens neuronal encoding of reward availability and target proximity together drive the onset and speed of reward-seeking locomotion."

How they establish stable phase relationships under diverse conditions is fundamentally important. The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a self-sustained, synchronized network of circadian oscillators that coordinates daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. To elucidate the underlying topology and signaling mechanisms that modulate circadian synchrony, we discriminated the firing of hundreds of SCN neurons continuously over days. Using an analysis method to identify functional interactions between neurons based on changes in their firing, we characterized a GABAergic network comprised of fast, excitatory, and inhibitory connections that is both stable over days and changes in strength with time of day. By monitoring PERIOD2 protein expression, we provide the first evidence that these millisecond-level interactions actively oppose circadian synchrony and inject jitter into daily rhythms. These results provide a mechanism by which circadian oscillators can tune their phase relationships under different environmental conditions. Systems of coupled oscillators abound in nature.

These results provide a mechanism by which circadian oscillators can tune their phase relationships under different environmental conditions. The study of coupled oscillators is part of a broader movement toward understanding complex systems (Strogatz, 2000Strogatz S.H. From Kuramoto to Crawford: exploring the onset of synchronization in populations of coupled oscillators.Physica D. 2000; 143: 1-20Crossref Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). In biology, intercellular communication can modulate the precision and synchronization of single-cell oscillations including glycolysis, somitogenesis, respiration, and daily cycling (Jiang et al., 2000Jiang Y.J. Aerne B.L. Smithers L. Haddon C. Ish-Horowicz D. Lewis J. Notch signalling and the synchronization of the somite segmentation clock.Nature. 2000; 408: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar; Herzog, 2007Herzog E.D. Neurons and networks in daily rhythms.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 790-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In many cases, coupled systems are inherently difficult to understand because the interactions are diverse and dynamic. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain provides an exceptional opportunity to reveal the topology, types, stability, and function of diverse connections in a defined network of neural oscillators. Neurons within the SCN express near 24 hr (circadian) oscillations in electrical activity and gene expression and entrain to regulate daily rhythms including metabolism, hormone release, and sleep-wake cycles. These cells depend on an intracellular transcription-translation feedback loop to generate daily rhythms and intercellular signaling for both synchronization and reliable rhythmicity (Yamaguchi et al., 2003Yamaguchi S. Isejima H. Matsuo T. Okura R. Yagita K. Kobayashi M. Okamura H. Synchronization of cellular clocks in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.Science. 2003; 302: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar; Webb et al., 2009Webb A.B. Angelo N. Huettner J.E. Herzog E.D. Intrinsic, nondeterministic circadian rhythm generation in identified mammalian neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 16493-16498Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Importantly, it is unknown how intercellular signaling modulates the cycle-to-cycle precision of circadian rhythms. Neural communication in the SCN includes gap junctions, neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Of these, loss of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) dramatically impairs circadian rhythms in the SCN and in behavior (Aton et al., 2005Aton S.J. Colwell C.S. Harmar A.J. Waschek J. Herzog E.D. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mediates circadian rhythmicity and synchrony in mammalian clock neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 476-483PubMed Google Scholar). Recent links between VIP signaling and schizophrenia highlight the possibility that VIP determines the development of the circuits underlying circadian synchrony (Vacic et al., 2011Vacic V. McCarthy S. Malhotra D. Murray F. Chou H.H. Peoples A. Makarov V. Yoon S. Bhandari A. Corominas R. et al.Duplications of the neuropeptide receptor gene VIPR2 confer significant risk for schizophrenia.Nature. 2011; 471: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To test whether VIP is required to maintain network topology in the SCN, we established a novel method to reliably map the functional connections between SCN neurons. Within the central nervous system, γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) serves as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter. Nearly every neuron within the SCN synthesizes GABA (Moore and Speh, 1993Moore R.Y. Speh J.C. GABA is the principal neurotransmitter of the circadian system.Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 150: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar; Belenky et al., 2008Belenky M.A. Yarom Y. Pickard G.E. Heterogeneous expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid-associated receptors and transporters in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 708-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and exhibits inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) that depend on GABA signaling and vary in frequency over the day (Itri et al., 2004Itri J.

Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In spite of its predominance, however, the function of GABAergic signaling in the SCN remains unresolved. GABA has been reported to be inhibitory at all times (Aton et al., 2006Aton S.J. Huettner J.E. Straume M. Herzog E.D.

Vansteensel M.J. Michel S. Block G.D. Meijer J.H. A GABAergic mechanism is necessary for coupling dissociable ventral and dorsal regional oscillators within the circadian clock.Curr.

Circadian modulation of GABA function in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus: excitatory effects during the night phase.J.

GABA in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus and its role in diurnal rhythmicity.Nature. 1997; 387: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Furthermore, daily administration of exogenous GABA suffices to coordinate SCN neurons (Liu and Reppert, 2000Liu C. Reppert S.M. GABA synchronizes clock cells within the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.Neuron. 2000; 25: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and GABA can transmit phase information between SCN populations (Albus et al., 2005Albus H. Vansteensel M.J. Michel S. Block G.D. Meijer J.H. A GABAergic mechanism is necessary for coupling dissociable ventral and dorsal regional oscillators within the circadian clock.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 886-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); however, synchrony among SCN cells can persist during chronic blockade of intrinsic GABAergic signaling (Aton et al., 2006Aton S.J. Huettner J.E. Straume M. Herzog E.D. GABA and Gi/o differentially control circadian rhythms and synchrony in clock neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19188-19193Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To resolve these apparent contradictions, we discriminated the discharge patterns of large numbers of individual neurons over multiple days and identified the stability and polarity of GABA-dependent interactions in the SCN. Using real-time bioluminescence imaging, we discovered a role for these synapses in circadian timekeeping. To assess functional communication between SCN neurons, we monitored gene expression and firing rates of individual SCN neurons in vitro. We found that in explants and dispersals, SCN neurons maintained synchronized circadian rhythms for as long as we recorded, demonstrating that the network mechanisms underlying coordinated circadian rhythmicity are intrinsic to these cultures (see Figure S1 available online). We took advantage of this self-sustained neural circuit to test the role and stability of specific connections in circadian rhythms. We recorded spontaneous action potentials from many SCN neurons simultaneously and continuously over days with 40 μs resolution on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) (Figure 1A). Consistent with previous reports (Welsh et al., 1995Welsh D.K. Logothetis D.E. Meister M. Reppert S.M. Individual neurons dissociated from rat suprachiasmatic nucleus express independently phased circadian firing rhythms.Neuron. 1995; 14: 697-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), circadian neurons fired daily for 9.8 ± 0.3 hr (mean ± SEM) with maximal firing frequencies of 4.7 ± 0.3 Hz (n = 101 neurons from 3 cultures). From the time-stamped spikes, we found spike trains that cross-correlated either positively or negatively between neurons (Figures 1B and 1C). These cross-correlations indicated that when one neuron fired, there was a low, but real, probability that its correlated partner increased or decreased its discharge rate with a short time delay. Correlated activity can reflect functional neural connectivity (Bialek et al., 1991Bialek W. Rieke F. de Ruyter van Steveninck R.R. Warland D. Reading a neural code.Science. 1991; 252: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar; Gerstein and Perkel, 1969Gerstein G.L. Perkel D.H. Simultaneously recorded trains of action potentials: analysis and functional interpretation.Science. 1969; 164: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) but may also arise coincidentally. To determine the likelihood of detecting spurious versus functional connections, we developed a method (BSAC; see Experimental Procedures) that generated an empirical distribution of Z scores for false-positive connections in SCN circuits. Iterative pair-wise analysis of spike trains from 610 neurons recorded on 10 MEAs yielded cross-correlograms of the 185,745 possible pairwise comparisons. Of these, 161,101 were impossible interactions because the neurons were in physically distinct MEAs (Figure S2). These false connections were more prevalent than would be expected based on the standard prediction intervals associated with their Z scores. This indicates that studies that use Z scores to determine the significance of correlated neural activity (e.g., functional neuroimaging or neural circuit analyses) can overestimate the number of connections. By including nodes (neurons) from independent networks (SCN cultures), we were able to set an empirically derived false discovery rate (FDR) to 0.001 (1 in every 1,000 correlations could be incorrect) and define functional connections as inter-neuronal firing correlations with either |Z| > 5.6 (positive cross-correlations) or |Z| > 4.68 (negative cross-correlations). Importantly, iterative comparisons across 3–10 cultures yielded similar Z score thresholds (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVAs for positive and negative correlations, respectively) indicating that connection detection was highly reproducible from culture to culture. For all SCN recordings, we calculated the frequency of detecting true neuronal interactions (hit rate) to be 96.0% ± 1.2% (mean ± SEM). Thus, BSAC recognizes functional connections with exceptionally high hit rates (96%) and low false-alarm rates (0.1%). We next sought to identify the signaling mechanism(s) underlying the identified communication between SCN neurons. Using the significantly cross-correlated firing patterns from 330 SCN neurons recorded in three cultures over 24 hr (n = 103–121 neurons/culture), we generated spatial maps of connectivity with neurons represented as nodes and their interactions as directed edges (Figure 1D). We found interactions within cultures that were inhibitory (58% ± 4%, mean ± SEM of n = 3 cultures), excitatory (42% ± 4%), or switched polarity (10% ± 1%) over the day (where the proportions of the three types of interactions summed to 100% within each culture). The median lag times to maximal cross-correlation for inhibitory and excitatory connections were 15.4 ms and 12.5 ms, respectively, with 71% of correlations peaking within 20 ms and 93% within 50 ms (Figure 1E). Distributions of lag times did not differ significantly between inhibitory and excitatory connections (p = 0.24, Student’s t test). Taking into account delays due to action potential propagation (0.1 to 6.5 ms; Figure S3) and postsynaptic response (15.4 ms as measured by Itri et al., 2004Itri J. Michel S. Waschek J.A. Colwell C.S. Circadian rhythm in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), these results suggest that a majority of the deduced connections represent direct, fast synaptic interactions and a minority (i.e., those with longer lag times) may arise from polysynaptic interactions, common inputs, or postinhibitory rebound. Because most, if not all, SCN neurons are GABAergic and express GABAA receptors, we tested whether the mapped interactions depend on GABA-mediated signaling using gabazine (Gbz, 100 μM) or bicuculline (200 μM). These GABAA receptor antagonists decreased the number of significant connections by 90% ± 2% (mean ± SEM) compared to vehicle (p = 0.03; Figure 1F; comparing connections from 120 randomly selected neurons in three cultures during vehicle and drug application). This loss in functional connections was not due to a decrease in firing since discharge rates actually increased slightly under GABA blockade (vehicle = 4.06 ± 0.31 Hz; mean ± SEM; GABAA-R antagonists = 5.41 ± 0.38 Hz; p < 0.05). Those few cross-correlations that remained had low Z-scores, suggesting that they could have been weakened by the blockers or could depend on an alternate, weak intercellular signal. Given the 96% hit rate of BSAC, we conclude that at least 93% of all detected interactions in these SCN cultures, both inhibitory and excitatory, depend on GABAA receptor signaling. Specific network topologies have been postulated to underlie coordinated activity in a variety of biological systems including neural networks (Grinstein and Linsker, 2005Grinstein G. Linsker R. Synchronous neural activity in scale-free network models versus random network models.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; Harris et al., 2003Harris K.D. Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Dragoi G. Buzsáki G. Organization of cell assemblies in the hippocampus.Nature. 2003; 424: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar; Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I.

GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These topologies are considered scale-free if their degree distributions follow a power law. To assess the architecture of the GABA-dependent network in the SCN, we measured the number of connections from and to each neuron (out and in node degrees, respectively). As indicated by spatial network maps (e.g., Figures 1D and S2), levels of single-cell connectivity were heterogeneous. Neurons received connections from a median of 4.4% of the network and sent connections to 4.5% of the network; strikingly, some cells (15 of 330 cells) were directly connected to greater than 25% of the whole population and only 1.8% of nodes remained unconnected. Out and in degree distributions did not differ significantly across cultures (p > 0.05 respectively, one-way ANOVAs) and were fit better by first-order exponential decay functions (r2 = 0.95 and 0.87, respectively) than power functions (out: r2 = 0.82, F(1,20) = 51.83, p < 0.0001; in: r2 = 0.81, F(1,15) = 8.13, p = 0.012, extra-sum-of-squares F test). That is, most cells sent and received approximately 1–4 connections with exponentially fewer sending or receiving progressively more connections (Figure 1G). In these cultures (n = 3), the proportion of possible interactions identified as functional (i.e., the network density) ranged from 0.047 to 0.061. Together, these data suggest that SCN neurons reliably form networks of fast neurotransmission comprising 5% to 6% of the possible connections with patterns that are not purely scale-free. Because we were concerned that the density of recording electrodes might affect the deduced topology of neural networks, we subsampled known networks to model the effects of undersampling and hidden nodes. We found that network density, clustering coefficient and path length were unaffected by including as little as 70% of the recorded neurons (Figure S4). These results suggest that BSAC accurately revealed network properties from recordings of 50–100 SCN neurons. To determine if physiologically identifiable subgroups of SCN cells were more or less connected, we linearly correlated node degree (sending, receiving, and total interactions) with measures of each neuron’s firing pattern at its daily peak of firing. Interestingly, no metric of the interspike interval distribution (i.e., the coefficient of variation, mode, median or mean) predicted the degree of connectivity of single neurons. We conclude that fast neurotransmission between SCN neurons has no apparent preference for neurons with specific firing patterns. Because VIP has been implicated in both synchronization of circadian neurons in the SCN (Aton et al., 2005Aton S.J. Colwell C.S. Harmar A.J. Waschek J. Herzog E.D. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mediates circadian rhythmicity and synchrony in mammalian clock neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 476-483PubMed Google Scholar) and neural development (Muller et al., 1995Muller J.M. Lelievre V. Becq-Giraudon L. Meunier A.C. VIP as a cell-growth and differentiation neuromodulator role in neurodevelopment.Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we tested whether VIP is required for normal GABA-dependent communication. We mapped connections within high-density, VIP null SCN cultures and found they did not differ from wild-type cultures in network density (0.057 ± 0.015 versus 0.045 ± 0.009, respectively; p = 0.50, n = 7 cultures per genotype), average path length (2.84 ± 0.32 nodes versus 3.30 ± 0.23; p = 0.27), mean node degree (0.11 ± 0.03 versus 0.09 ± 0.01; p = 0.49) or mean clustering coefficient (0.18 ± 0.03 versus 0.23 ± 0.03, respectively; p = 0.41). Together, these data indicate that VIP signaling is not required to determine the topology of the fast connections in the SCN. We conclude that VIP provides a synchronizing, not a trophic, signal to coordinate circadian cells within the SCN. Changes in functional connectivity over milliseconds to hours can be critical for experience-dependent plasticity, synchronization, or metastability in the nervous system (Harris et al., 2003Harris K.D.

To date, it is not known if reliable changes in functional connectivity are inherent to specific synapses. To examine the dynamics of specific connections, we monitored the strength of correlated electrical activity from identified pairs of SCN cells over a circadian cycle (Figure 2A). Iterative pair-wise analysis yielded heat maps that convey the temporal dynamics of all connections found within representative synchronized networks (Figure 2B). Importantly, when both neurons fired during the day, changes in connection strength occurred independently of circadian changes in firing frequencies (r2 = 0.006, p = 0.27). We found that the strength of SCN connections fluctuated (coefficient of variation = 0.24 ± 0.01, mean ± SEM, n = 189 pairwise interactions from 3 cultures), with a majority of identified connections increasing, decreasing or oscillating in strength over the day as opposed to varying randomly (Figure 2C). To assess the relative stability of SCN connections, we tracked individual, fast connections over multiple days from three cultures. We found millisecond-level connectivity between identified pairs of neurons that persisted over multiple days regardless of whether their circadian patterns were in phase or antiphase (Figures 2D and 2E, respectively). Together, these data strongly suggest that sparse GABAergic connections can change strength over hours, persist over multiple days within synchronized SCN networks, and do not define a unique phase relationship between circadian SCN neurons. Given that we found significant GABAA receptor-mediated interactions within SCN networks that can change in strength over time, we tested the role of these connections in modulating circadian rhythmicity. Using a CCD camera, we monitored single-cell rhythms in Period2::Luciferase (PER2::LUC) expression from SCN explants over 12 days with 1 to 15 min resolution (Figure 3A). Period measurements for single cells were derived by continuous wavelet transform analysis (CWT) and period precision was calculated based upon the variance of the continuous period time series. Consistent with a prior report (Aton et al., 2006Aton S.J. Huettner J.E. Straume M. Herzog E.D. GABA and Gi/o differentially control circadian rhythms and synchrony in clock neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19188-19193Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we found that GABAA receptor antagonism with 100 μM gabazine did not alter the level (Figure S5) or average period (23.63 ± 0.10 hr; mean ± SEM, n = 122 neurons in three SCN explants) of cellular PER2 rhythms compared to baseline (23.42 ± 0.12 hr; p > 0.05). Importantly, GABA blockade significantly decreased period variability of individual cells (0.70 ± 0.04 hr, mean ± SEM) compared to vehicle (0.96 ± 0.07 hr; p = 0.002; n = 3 SCN explants per treatment, 218 total cells; Figure 3B). The variability of the interpeak intervals was also decreased during GABA blockade (0.76 ± 0.05 hr) compared to vehicle (0.98 ± 0.08 hr, p = 0.02). Together these data show that endogenous GABAA signaling decreases precision of circadian oscillations in networked SCN neurons. Because GABAA receptor signaling decreased precision of circadian gene expression in the presence of VIP, we postulated that GABAA receptor activation opposes the synchronizing effects of VIP in the SCN. We monitored PER2::LUC expression from VIP null SCN explants (Vip−/−;PER2::LUC). Consistent with previous reports of Per1 transcription and PER2 protein in VIP-deficient SCN (Maywood et al., 2011Maywood E.S. Chesham J.E. O’Brien J.A. Hastings M.H. A diversity of paracrine signals sustains molecular circadian cycling in suprachiasmatic nucleus circuits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 14306-14311Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), circadian bioluminescence damped over 6 days of baseline recording (relative amplitude error [RAE] = 0.044 ± 0.0003). SCN were then placed in fresh media with either 100 μM gabazine or vehicle and monitored for an additional 6 days (Figure 4A). Remarkably, blockade of GABAA signaling prevented significant damping in VIP-deficient SCN slices (for vehicle versus gabazine, RAEtreated/RAEbaseline = 1.13 ± 0.26 versus 0.51 ± 0.10, respectively; n = 10 SCN explants per treatment; p < 0.05). CWT analysis of the same data provided an independent quantification of the increased amplitude of circadian rhythmicity during GABA blockade (Figure 4B). We conclude that GABA is critical for the loss of circadian rhythmicity in VIP-deficient SCN. To further determine how GABAA receptor signaling impacts circadian rhythms in single cells, we recorded bioluminescence using a cooled-CCD camera from SCN explants. We found that over 7 days of baseline treatment, Vip−/− cells exhibited low amplitude PER2::LUC oscillations (RAE = 0.116 ± 0.001; Figures 4C and 4D) and progressively desynchronized (Figure 4E). Upon medium change and addition of gabazine (100 μM), single cell PER2 expression (Figure S6) and rhythmicity dramatically increased (RAE = 0.004 ± 0.000, p < 0.000001 versus baseline; n = 23 cells) and failed to damp or desynchronize for the duration of the recording. Together these results indicate that GABAA receptor-mediated signaling induces cycle-to-cycle jitter, weakly opposing the stabilizing and synchronizing effects of VIP on circadian rhythms in the SCN. Intercellular communication is necessary for proper SCN timekeeping and regulation of daily behaviors (Yamaguchi et al., 2003Yamaguchi S. Isejima H. Matsuo T. Okura R. Yagita K. Kobayashi M. Okamura H. Synchronization of cellular clocks in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.Science. 2003; 302: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). By iteratively analyzing spike trains, we have produced the first maps of the functional, fast connections in the SCN network. Based on their probability to change firing within 50 ms, sensitivity to antagonists, and reproducibility across cultures and days, we posit that at least 93% of these connections represent direct, GABAA receptor-mediated interactions between SCN neurons. This is consistent with numerous studies that found most, if not all, SCN neurons receive GABAergic inputs (Moore and Speh, 1993Moore R.Y. Speh J.C. GABA is the principal neurotransmitter of the circadian system.Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 150: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar; Belenky et al., 2008Belenky M.A. Yarom Y. Pickard G.E.

Neurol. 2008; 506: 708-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The remaining 7% of connections we detected were relatively weak and could reflect GABAergic communication incompletely blocked by the concentrations of the antagonists used or weak signaling via other pathways (e.g., glycine neurotransmission [Mordel et al., 2011Mordel J. Karnas D. Inyushkin A. Challet E. Pévet P. Meissl H. Activation of glycine receptor phase-shifts the circadian rhythm in neuronal activity in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar] or gap junctions [Long et al., 2005Long M.A. Jutras M.J. Connors B.W. Burwell R.D. Electrical synapses coordinate activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar]). We conclude that GABA mediates nearly all interactions capable of influencing the millisecond firing patterns among SCN neurons. Electron microscopic studies have found that individual SCN neurons receive between 300–1,200 synaptic contacts (Güldner, 1976Güldner F.H. Synaptology of the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.Cell Tissue Res. 1976; 165: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a relatively low number compared to many brain areas. Whole-cell recordings in acute slices report typical SCN neurons fire during the day at 5 Hz with spontaneous IPSC frequencies at 3–12 Hz (Itri et al., 2004Itri J. Michel S. Waschek J.A. Colwell C.S. Circadian rhythm in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistent with this evidence for inputs from small numbers of neurons, we found that functional GABAergic connectivity is sparse within SCN networks with approximately 55% of neurons responding to inputs from 1–4 neurons. We also found that nearly every SCN neuron sends at least one GABA-dependent output, such that most functionally connect to approximately 5% of the network and some connect to over 25% of the network. Taken together, these results suggest GABA provides sparse, weak and fast connectivity among SCN neurons. Many biological networks have been hypothesized to be scale free and follow a power-law distribution. Within the SCN, recent computational models have predicted that a small-world scale-free network would be the most efficient topology for circadian synchrony (Vasalou et al., 2009Vasalou C. Herzog E.D. Henson M.A. Small-world network models of intercellular coupling predict enhanced synchronization in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2009; 24: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; Hafner et al., 2012Hafner M. Koeppl H. Gonze D. Effect of network architecture on synchronization and entrainment properties of the circadian oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002419Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, here we provide clear evidence that signaling through GABAA receptors is not strictly patterned as a small-world network and, rather than enhance synchrony, decreases the precision and synchrony of neuronal rhythms. This is distinct from the well-described role of GABAergic signaling in coordinating higher-frequency (e.g., gamma [40–80 Hz]) neocortical oscillations (Ermentrout et al., 2008Ermentrout G.B. Galán R.F. Urban N.N. Reliability, synchrony and noise.Trends Neurosci. 2008; 31: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but is consistent with the previous report that GABA is not required for SCN neurons to maintain circadian synchrony (Aton et al., 2006Aton S.J. Huettner J.E. Straume M. Herzog E.D. GABA and Gi/o differentially control circadian rhythms and synchrony in clock neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19188-19193Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast to an extensive literature predicting GABA-induced synchrony (Liu and Reppert, 2000Liu C. Reppert S.M. GABA synchronizes clock cells within the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.Neuron. 2000; 25: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar; Diekman and Forger, 2009Diekman C.O. Forger D.B. Clustering predicted by an electrophysiological model of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2009; 24: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), only a few theoretical studies have predicted that GABA could lead to reduced precision and synchrony in neural networks (Kopell and Ermentrout, 2004Kopell N. Ermentrout B. Chemical and electrical synapses perform complementary roles in the synchronization of interneuronal networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15482-15487Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We posit that GABAA signaling may accelerate re-entrainment of the SCN to phase-shifted timing cues by increasing cycle-to-cycle jitter so that the cells are more easily phase-shifted by another signal (e.g., VIP). Our results lead us to predict that drugs that enhance GABAA signaling (e.g., benzodiazepines) in the SCN could reduce the precision of circadian rhythms but enhance their adjustment to new schedules. Indeed, benzodiazepine administration speeds entrainment of human behavioral and hormonal circadian rhythms after simulated travel across time zones (Buxton et al., 2000Buxton O.M. Copinschi G. Van Onderbergen A. Karrison T.G. Van Cauter E. A benzodiazepine hypnotic facilitates adaptation of circadian rhythms and sleep-wake homeostasis to an eight hour delay shift simulating westward jet lag.Sleep. 2000; 23: 915-927PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is highly unusual for GABA to be excitatory in the adult mammalian nervous system, previous studies have provided apparently contradictory evidence that within the SCN, GABA can be excitatory, inhibitory, or both. We found that approximately 60% of all GABA-dependent connections were inhibitory and 40% were excitatory throughout the circadian day. A small fraction of these connections switched polarity for at least one hour during the day. The differential role of inhibitory and excitatory currents in the SCN remains unresolved. A central focus of biological timing research has been to understand the processes that promote synchronization. It is currently appreciated that activation of Gαs and Gαi/o protein-coupled receptors is vital to maintain synchrony among SCN cells (Aton et al., 2005Aton S.J. Colwell C.S. Harmar A.J. Waschek J. Herzog E.D. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mediates circadian rhythmicity and synchrony in mammalian clock neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 476-483PubMed Google Scholar, Aton et al., 2006Aton S.J. Huettner J.E. Straume M. Herzog E.D. GABA and Gi/o differentially control circadian rhythms and synchrony in clock neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19188-19193Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; Doi et al., 2011Doi M. Ishida A. Miyake A. Sato M. Komatsu R. Yamazaki F. Kimura I. Tsuchiya S. Kori H. Seo K. et al.Circadian regulation of intracellular G-protein signaling mediates intercellular synchrony and rhythmicity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.Nat. Comm. 2011; 2: 327Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). VIP and, to a lesser extent, vasopressin and gastrin releasing peptide have been shown to mediate rhythm stability in and synchrony among circadian cells (Maywood et al., 2011Maywood E.S. Chesham J.E. O’Brien J.A. Hastings M.H. A diversity of paracrine signals sustains molecular circadian cycling in suprachiasmatic nucleus circuits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 14306-14311Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have found GABA to destabilize and desynchronize circadian cells. Synchronization and desynchronization are thus both active processes that can be differentially modulated. It is interesting to speculate that developmental and seasonal changes may alter the balance between fast neurotransmission and slower neuropeptide signaling to adjust the timing among SCN neurons. It is possible that GABA plays an important role within this setting to actively drive networks of oscillators to new phase relationships. Additionally, recent work suggests that a hierarchy of neuropeptidergic signals may differentially promote or sustain rhythmicity and synchrony among SCN cells (Maywood et al., 2011Maywood E.S. Chesham J.E. O’Brien J.A. Hastings M.H. A diversity of paracrine signals sustains molecular circadian cycling in suprachiasmatic nucleus circuits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 14306-14311Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In light of our results, we must place GABAA signaling within this hierarchy and classify potential synchronizing agents by their ability to overcome the destabilizing effects of GABA. Our data suggest that VIP may be the only agent capable of overcoming this destabilizing effect since it is only after VIP signaling is eliminated that the desynchronizing effects of GABA are unmasked. Given that VIP signaling diminishes during aging (Cayetanot et al., 2005Cayetanot F. Bentivoglio M. Aujard F. Arginine-vasopressin and vasointestinal polypeptide rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the mouse lemur reveal aging-related alterations of circadian pacemaker neurons in a non-human primate.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), increasingly unopposed GABAergic signaling may weaken SCN neuronal synchrony and contribute to sleep/wake cycle fragmentation in the elderly. See a detailed description in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. All animal procedures complied with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and were approved by the Washington University Animal Care and Use Committee. Spike trains from SCN neurons were recorded using MEAs and the Z score and strength of each interaction was measured. We graphed functional connections with GUESS software and analyzed network architecture with NodeXL software. We developed an empirical method to discriminate correlated activity that derived from real versus coincidental neuronal interactions. We reasoned that correlations between spike trains recorded from neurons in physically distinct culture dishes do not signify connectivity. Using this logic, we iteratively cross-correlated spike trains from all neurons across 10 cultures (samples) over 1 hr to determine the distribution of Z scores associated with inherently false across-sample correlations. Using the full distribution of false across-sample correlations, we determined Z score magnitude thresholds that corresponded with likelihoods of discovering false-positive across-array correlations. To determine if connection strength systematically changed with time of day, we fit the strength versus time data with linear and cosine functions and estimated the resultant p value using the F test. PER2::LUC expression from SCN explants was measured using photomultiplier tubes or a CCD camera. Circadian period, amplitude and period variability were assessed using FFT-NLLS and CWT. Additional statistical tests were done with Origin 7 software. Mean periods were compared by two-tailed t tests. Distributions of periods were compared using both Levene’s and Brown-Forsythe’s tests for equal variance. Bicuculline methiodide (Sigma) and SR95531 (gabazine; Tocris) were diluted in water or DMSO. Drugs or vehicle controls were added at less than 0.5% of total volume). We thank B. Carlson, T. Holy, J. Huettner, P. Taghert, C. Zorumski, H.

https://openalex.org/W2091252001,"Feedforward inhibition sharpens the precision of neurons throughout ascending auditory pathways, including the binaural neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO). However, the biophysical influence of inhibition is poorly understood, particularly at higher frequencies at which the relative phase of inhibition and excitation becomes ambiguous. Here, we show in gerbil MSO principal cells in vitro that feedforward inhibition precedes direct excitation, providing a concurrent hyperpolarization and conductance shunt during EPSP summation. We show with dual-patch recordings and dynamic clamp that both the linearity and temporal fidelity of synaptic integration is improved by reducing Kv1 potassium channel conductance during inhibition, which counters membrane shunting even at high frequencies at which IPSPs sum. The reduction of peak excitation by preceding inhibition lowers spike probability, narrowing but not shifting the window for detecting binaural coincidence. The interplay between inhibition and potassium conductances thus improves the consistency and resolution of ITD coding across different frequencies."

Thus, individual exocytotic events result in spontaneous GPCR-mediated transmission, similar to synaptic activation of classical ligand-gated ion channels. The discovery of miniature endplate potentials at the neuromuscular junction critically shaped the understanding of neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission. Since its discovery, spontaneous neurotransmitter release has been described at many synapses in the mammalian CNS but only where ligand-gated ion channels underlie the postsynaptic response. While a number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to mediate inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) by activating inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs), these are thought to result from diffusion of transmitter to extrasynaptic sites (Isaacson et al., 1993Isaacson J.S.

The slow intrinsic kinetics of GPCR signaling and the temporal dispersion of activation resulting from long distance diffusion may obscure GPCR-mediated miniature synaptic events. Electrical stimulation in the midbrain evokes vesicular dopamine release. The lack of structural evidence for axon terminals in the rat substantia nigra pars compacta (Bayer and Pickel, 1990Bayer V.E. Pickel V.M.

Somatodendritic release has been measured using multiple assays (Fortin et al., 2006Fortin G.D. Desrosiers C.C. Yamaguchi N. Trudeau L.-E.

Spontaneous, or unstimulated, somatodendritic release of dopamine has been detected by amperometry and high-performance liquid chromatography from midbrain dopamine neurons in brain slices (Jaffe et al., 1998Jaffe E.H.

Basal somatodendritic dopamine release requires snare proteins.J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence that this spontaneous release activates a GIRK-mediated conductance. This study reports spontaneous miniature IPSCs (sIPSCs) in dopamine neurons from mouse substantia nigra pars compacta (SN). The results reveal that spontaneous vesicular dopamine release produced sIPSCs by local D2 receptor activation of GIRK channels that were not dependent on voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels or intracellular calcium stores. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from SN dopamine neurons in horizontal midbrain slices from wild-type mice, in the presence of NMDA, AMPA, GABAA, GABAB, and nACh receptor antagonists. Spontaneous IPSCs occurred approximately 1 event/min (Figures 1A, 3A, and 3D), similar to the low frequency of spontaneous amperometric events recorded from SN neurons (Jaffe et al., 1998Jaffe E.H. Marty A. Schulte A. Chow R.H. Extrasynaptic vesicular transmitter release from the somata of substantia nigra neurons in rat midbrain slices.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3548-3553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sIPSCs were abolished by the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (300 nM, Figure 1A). A single electrical stimulus evoked D2 receptor-mediated IPSCs (eIPSCs) (Figures 1B and 1C). Blockade of GIRK conductance with Ba2+ decreases the current induced by dopamine in SN dopamine neurons (Lacey et al., 1987Lacey M.G. Mercuri N.B. North R.A. Dopamine acts on D2 receptors to increase potassium conductance in neurones of the rat substantia nigra zona compacta.J. Physiol. 1987; 392: 397-416PubMed Google Scholar). Ba2+ (100 μM) eliminated both evoked and spontaneous IPSCs (p = 0.009, n = 6, Figure 1B). Thus, spontaneous IPSCs are the result of D2 receptor activation of GIRK channels. The rise time of the sIPSCs and eIPSCs were identical (p = 0.76). However, the duration of sIPSCs, measured at 20% of the peak, was shorter (69%) than the eIPSCs (p < 0.001, eIPSCs n = 77 and sIPSCs n = 76, Figure 4D). The rise time and duration of sIPSCs were similar to the current evoked using fast application of a high concentration of dopamine (≥10 μM) onto membrane patches (Ford et al., 2009Ford C.P. Phillips P.E.M. Williams J.T. The time course of dopamine transmission in the ventral tegmental area.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13344-13352Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, sIPSCs probably resulted from a sharp rise of a high concentration of dopamine, inconsistent with extended diffusion away from the release site. To compare the amplitude of sIPSCs to eIPSCs, we employed minimal stimulation to evoke eIPSCs with the smallest resolvable amplitude over baseline noise. The eIPSC amplitude distribution from minimal stimulation was normal (p = 0.4, mean of 8.8 pA, median of 8.4 pA, Figures 1D and 1E). The amplitude distribution of sIPSCs was right skewed (p < 0.001, mean of 9.2 pA, median of 7.9 pA, Figures 1D, 1E, and 3B), such that the distributions of eIPSC and sIPSC amplitudes were statistically different (p = 0.007, n = 188 eIPSCs and 1,137 sIPSCs). However, the median amplitude of sIPSCs was similar to eIPSCs evoked by minimal stimulation (p = 0.07). Although these results are suggestive of a quantal event, the slow kinetics of D2 IPSCs and low frequency of sIPSCs necessitated the combination of data from multiple cells and therefore limit further quantitative analysis. Taken together, the results suggest that, with the exception of some larger sIPSCs, the current elicited by a single resolvable release event was similar whether the release was spontaneous or evoked. Next, the mechanism of spontaneous dopamine release was compared to that of electrically evoked release. Disruption of the vesicular monoamine transporter with reserpine (1 μM, >20 min) eliminated sIPSCs (p = 0.03, Figure 2A), confirming that spontaneous dopamine release is vesicular. Application of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 600 nM) or Cd2+ (100 μM) abolished eIPSCs, but TTX failed to alter the frequency (p = 0.40, Figure 2B) or amplitude (p = 0.95, Figure 2C) of sIPSCs, demonstrating that sIPSCs were not dependent on action potentials. Likewise, sIPSCs persisted in Cd2+, with no change in frequency (p = 0.35, Figure 2D), indicating that sIPSCs were not dependent on calcium entry via voltage-gated calcium channels. There are conflicting reports of the role of intracellular calcium stores on the release of dopamine in the midbrain (Courtney et al., 2012Courtney N.A. Mamaligas A.A. Ford C.P.

To determine whether spontaneous dopamine release was dependent on intracellular calcium stores, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) was used to deplete calcium stores. The application of CPA (10 μM, >3 min) had no effect on the frequency of sIPSCs (p = 0.41, Figures 2D and 2E), whereas previous experiments found that inositol triphosphate (IP3)-mediated SK currents in dopamine neurons were eliminated (Ford et al., 2010Ford C.P.

Perfusion with calcium-free ACSF reduced the frequency but did not eliminate the sIPSCs (p = 0.04, Figures 2D and 2F). While the established theory suggests that evoked and spontaneous IPSCs are the result of somatodendritic dopamine release, the site of release remains to be determined. Furthermore, the question of whether a single neuron releases dopamine onto itself has not been resolved. The experimental conditions (voltage clamp and strong intracellular calcium buffering with BAPTA) make it unlikely that eIPSCs are induced by release from the recorded neuron. However, it remains possible that sIPSCs may result from dopamine release from the recorded neuron, since spontaneous release is TTX insensitive and does not require voltage-gated calcium channels. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous miniature postsynaptic currents can fluctuate due to presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms, including differences in transmitter content (Frerking et al., 1995Frerking M.

Konnerth A. Sakmann B. Quantal analysis of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal slices: a patch-clamp study.J. Physiol. 1990; 430: 213-249PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic and vesicular dopamine levels are increased after treatment with the catecholamine precursor L-DOPA (Pothos et al., 1998Pothos E.N. Davila V. Sulzer D. Presynaptic recording of quanta from midbrain dopamine neurons and modulation of the quantal size.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4106-4118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus enhancing the eIPSC (Beckstead et al., 2004Beckstead M.J. Grandy D.K. Wickman K. Williams J.T. Vesicular dopamine release elicits an inhibitory postsynaptic current in midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2004; 42: 939-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Incubation in L-DOPA (10 μM, 10 min) increased the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs (p < 0.001, Figures 3A and 3B ). L-DOPA can be taken up by 5-HT neurons, metabolized to dopamine (Arai et al., 1994Arai R. Karasawa N. Geffard M. Nagatsu T. Nagatsu I. Immunohistochemical evidence that central serotonin neurons produce dopamine from exogenous L-DOPA in the rat, with reference to the involvement of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.Brain Res. 1994; 667: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and, in parkinsonian rats, released from 5-HT terminals (Carta et al., 2007Carta M. Carlsson T. Kirik D. Björklund A. Dopamine released from 5-HT terminals is the cause of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in parkinsonian rats.Brain. 2007; 130: 1819-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The increase in frequency of sIPSCs after treatment with L-DOPA could involve aberrant dopamine release from 5-HT terminals. This possibility was examined with the application of the selective 5-HT1 agonist 5-CT, since activation of 5-HT1 receptors potently inhibits release from 5-HT terminals (Bobker and Williams, 1989Bobker D.H. Williams J.T. Serotonin agonists inhibit synaptic potentials in the rat locus ceruleus in vitro via 5-hydroxytryptamine1A and 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptors.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Dopamine released from 5-HT terminals is the cause of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in parkinsonian rats.Brain. 2007; 130: 1819-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Application of 5-CT (1 μM) had no effect on the frequency of the sIPSCs (ACSF: 0.6 ± 0.2 per min, 5-CT: 1.0 ± 0.3 per min, paired two-tailed t test, p = 0.3, n = 7 cells) even after treatment of slices with L-DOPA (control: 0.8 ± 0.1 per min, L-DOPA: 3.7 ± 0.7 per min, two-way ANOVA, p = 0.96, n = 7 cells). Activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin increased the amplitude of eIPSCs (Beckstead et al., 2007Beckstead M.J. Ford C.P. Phillips P.E.M. Williams J.T. Presynaptic regulation of dendrodendritic dopamine transmission.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 1479-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Forskolin (1 μM) also increased the frequency (p < 0.05, Figure 3D) and amplitude of sIPSCs (p = 0.005, median of 8.7 pA). The uptake of dopamine by dopamine transporters is the primary mechanism of terminating dopamine signaling in the midbrain (Ford et al., 2010Ford C.P. Gantz S.C. Phillips P.E.M. Williams J.T. Control of extracellular dopamine at dendrite and axon terminals.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 6975-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the presence of cocaine, a nonspecific monoamine transporter blocker, the clearance of extracellular dopamine is prolonged (Ford et al., 2010Ford C.P. Gantz S.C. Phillips P.E.M. Williams J.T. Control of extracellular dopamine at dendrite and axon terminals.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 6975-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), potentiating the eIPSC (Beckstead et al., 2004Beckstead M.J. Grandy D.K. Wickman K. Williams J.T.

Cocaine (300 nM), in the presence of forskolin (1 μM), further increased the amplitude (p < 0.001, median of 10.0 pA, Figure 3C) and frequency (p < 0.001, Figure 3D) of sIPSCs. The role of postsynaptic receptor availability on the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs was examined using experiments with a transgenic mouse strain (TH-hD2S) that expressed a human D2 receptor (short isoform) with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope targeted to catecholamine neurons, in addition to endogenous D2 receptors (see Experimental Procedures). Functional coupling of D2 receptors to GIRK channels in TH-hD2S mice was evaluated by measuring the maximal D2 receptor-mediated outward currents evoked by iontophoretic application of dopamine onto dopamine neurons, normalized to capacitance (dopamine current density). The dopamine current density of SN neurons in wild-type mice was 8.9 ± 0.4 pA/pF (n = 37), consistent with previously reported values (Gantz et al., 2011Gantz S.C. Ford C.P. Neve K.A. Williams J.T. Loss of Mecp2 in substantia nigra dopamine neurons compromises the nigrostriatal pathway.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 12629-12637Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the dopamine current density in TH-hD2S mice was elevated (14.6 ± 1.0 pA/pF, p < 0.01, n = 32). There was no difference in current density evoked by the GABAB agonist baclofen in TH-hD2S (11.1 ± 0.9 pA/pF, p = 0.57, n = 14) compared to wild-type mice (12.2 ± 0.8 pA/pF, n = 19). Thus, the increased expression of D2 receptors in the TH-hD2S mice did not interfere with the activation of GIRK by other GPCRs. The frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs from dopamine neurons in TH-hD2S mice were greater than those from wild-type mice (p < 0.001, Figures 3A and 3E). These results suggest that the level of D2 receptor expression is a factor in determining the amplitude of the IPSC, although it is not known to what extent the overexpression of D2 receptors has on other processes such as tyrosine hydroxylase expression, dopamine synthesis, or the expression of dopamine transporters. Taken together, the results indicate that the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous D2 receptor-mediated IPSCs are altered by both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. Exposure to drugs of abuse causes morphological and functional changes to midbrain dopamine neurons (Heikkinen et al., 2009Heikkinen A.E. Möykkynen T.P. Korpi E.R.

Neurosci. 2007; 26: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Many of these changes occur after a single exposure, including potentiated spontaneous GABA- (Melis et al., 2002Melis M. Camarini R. Ungless M.A. Bonci A. Long-lasting potentiation of GABAergic synapses in dopamine neurons after a single in vivo ethanol exposure.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2074-2082PubMed Google Scholar) and glutamate- (Ungless et al., 2001Ungless M.A. Whistler J.L. Malenka R.C. Bonci A. Single cocaine exposure in vivo induces long-term potentiation in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2001; 411: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) synaptic currents. To determine whether dopamine-dependent sIPSCs were similarly plastic, we treated mice with a single dose of cocaine (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). One day after treatment, the dopamine current density in SN neurons from cocaine-treated mice was elevated (12.3 ± 0.7 pA/pF, p < 0.01, n = 26), and the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs were increased (p < 0.01, Figure 3A; p < 0.001, Figure 3F). There was no change in baclofen current density (11.3 ± 0.8 pA/pF, p = 0.57, n = 15). Therefore, spontaneous dopamine transmission, like GABA- and glutamate-dependent transmission, was increased by a single exposure to cocaine. In vitro, dopamine neurons fire action potentials in a regular, pacemaker pattern. Electrical stimulation causes a sulpiride-sensitive pause in firing, indicating that eIPSCs inhibit spontaneous firing (Beckstead and Williams, 2007Beckstead M.J. Williams J.T. Long-term depression of a dopamine IPSC.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2074-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; Beckstead et al., 2004Beckstead M.J. Grandy D.K. Wickman K. Williams J.T.

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 13520-13528Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Loose cell-attached recordings were made from SN dopamine neurons from wild-type mice to assess whether sIPSCs can inhibit firing. A single electrical stimulus caused a pause (e-pause) in pacemaker firing (Figures 4A and 4C ). Spontaneous pauses (s-pause) occurred approximately 1 event/min (Figures 4A and 4B). Exposure to L-DOPA (10 μM, 10 min) increased the frequency of s-pauses (p < 0.05, n = 13 cells, Figures 4A and 4B). The s-pauses were abolished by sulpiride (600 nM, p < 0.01, Figure 4A), indicating that the s-pauses were the result of D2 receptor activation. The duration of the pauses were calculated by subtracting the mean interspike interval (ISI) from the time between two action potentials (Figure 4C). The duration of the s-pause was shorter (71%) than the e-pause (p < 0.01, n = 59 e-pauses and 50 s-pauses, Figure 4D). It is interesting to note that the difference in duration is the same as that when comparing the evoked and spontaneous IPSCs (Figure 4D). After L-DOPA, the duration of the s-pause remained shorter than the e-pause (74% of e-pause, p < 0.001, n = 130 e-pauses and 255 s-pauses, Figure 4E). In a separate set of experiments, reserpine was used to verify that vesicular release of dopamine underlies the s-pauses. Application of reserpine (1 μM, 10 min) dramatically reduced the frequency of s-pauses (L-DOPA: 2.43 ± 0.8 per min; reserpine: 0.15 ± 0.1 per min; paired two-tailed t test, p = 0.03, n = 8 cells). Taken together, these results indicate that sIPSCs and spontaneous pauses result from spontaneous dopamine release. Thus, spontaneous release of dopamine in brain slices influences the firing pattern of dopamine neurons. The presence of spontaneous miniature GIRK-mediated IPSCs is the strongest evidence to date that signaling mediated by GPCRs can be similar to transmission mediated by ligand-gated ion channels. First, the results of this study demonstrate that despite the slow intrinsic signaling kinetics of GPCR activation, these receptors can signal in a point-to-point manner, in which the presynaptic site of release is located very close to postsynaptic receptors. Second, as in other neurotransmitter systems, the postsynaptic currents elicited by evoked and spontaneous dopamine release are largely indistinguishable. Lastly, spontaneous D2 receptor-mediated transmission was altered by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and was plastic, changing after a single in vivo exposure to cocaine. Thus, the factors that regulate synaptic transmission mediated by D2 receptors and ligand-gated ion channels are similar. It is likely that spontaneous GIRK-dependent IPSCs are common, adding an unrealized role of GPCR-dependent signaling in neuronal regulation. All animals were maintained and sacrificed according to the approved protocols at Oregon Health and Science University. Male and female DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice (>30 days old) were used. Cocaine-treated animals received one intraperitoneal injection (20 mg/kg) 24 hr prior to use. Horizontal midbrain slices (220 μm) were made, as previously described (Gantz et al., 2011Gantz S.C. Ford C.P. Neve K.A. Williams J.T. Loss of Mecp2 in substantia nigra dopamine neurons compromises the nigrostriatal pathway.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 12629-12637Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in ice-cold physiologically equivalent saline solution (modified Krebs’ buffer) containing 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.4 mM CaCl2, 1.4 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 11 mM D-glucose with 10 μM MK-801. Slices were incubated at 32°C in vials with 95/5% O2/CO2 saline with 10 μM MK-801 for at least 30 min, before recordings. Slices once mounted on a recording chamber attached to an upright microscope (Olympus) were maintained at 36°C–37°C and perfused at a rate of 4.0 ml/min with modified Krebs’ buffer. Using infrared illumination, the SN was identified visually, under 5× magnification, by location in relation to the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract and the midline. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained with glass electrodes (1.8–2.2 MΩ) and an internal solution containing 115 mM K-methylsulfate, 20 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM GTP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, and 10 mM BAPTA, [pH 7.30–7.43] 275–288 mOsm. The cells were voltage clamped at −60 mV with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Loose (<30 MΩ) cell-attached recordings were made with glass electrodes (1.4–2.0 MΩ) and an internal solution containing modified Krebs’ buffer. Dopamine neurons were identified by a large hyperpolarization-induced Ih current, the presence of spontaneous pacemaker firing of wide (∼2 ms) action potentials at 1–5 Hz, and either the presence of a D2 receptor-mediated IPSC or the sensitivity to exogenously applied dopamine. Immediately after gaining access to the cell, membrane capacitance, series resistance, and input resistance were measured with the application of 50 pulses (+2 mV for 50 ms) averaged before computation using AxoGraph (sampled at 50 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz). Dopamine release was evoked by a single electrical stimulus (0.5 ms) and pharmacologically isolated by the following receptor blockers in the external bath solution: picrotoxin (100 μM), hexamethonium (50 μM), DNQX (10 μM), and CGP 55845 (100 nM). Data were acquired using AxoGraph software (sampled at 10 kHz, filtered at 5 kHz) and Chart 5 (AD Instruments). Recordings were post hoc filtered at 1 kHz and visually inspected to select spontaneous IPSCs manually. Original recordings were then decimated (averaged 10 points, 1 ms). Single peak spontaneous IPSCs with amplitudes greater than 2.1 times the SD of baseline noise were detected using a semiautomated sliding template detection procedure with AxoGraph X. The template was generated by averaging multiple sIPSCs. Each detected event was visually inspected. Events were discarded if the average baseline noise (>300 ms) was greater than the peak ±1.5 s from the peak. Peak amplitudes were determined by averaging the current ±20 ms from the greatest upward deflection. The amplitude distribution of the baseline noise was measured by averaging the baseline current ±20 ms from the greatest upward deflection, 220 ms after a point set to 0 pA, once every 50 s (n = 26 cells). To compare the kinetics of eIPSCs to sIPSCs, spontaneous events with a single peak were selected. Duration of eIPSCs and sIPSCs was determined by measuring the width at 20% of the peak amplitude (see Figure 1C). All drugs were applied through bath perfusion, except dopamine, which was applied by iontophoresis. Iontophoretic pipettes (70–110 MΩ) were filled with 1 M dopamine and the tip placed within 10 μm of the soma. A negative backing current (6–11 nA) prevented leakage. Dopamine was ejected with the application of positive current (2–6 s) with an Axoclamp 2A amplifier to elicit a maximal dopamine-induced outward current. A transgenic mouse expressing the human D2 dopamine receptor short isoform (hD2S) with a flag epitope on the amino terminus was generated by nuclear microinjection using standard techniques. The transgene consisted of an 8.5 kb genomic fragment from the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH) containing 5′ regulatory sequences, the basal promoter, and 26 base pairs from the 5′ untranslated region in exon 1 followed by a 0.7 kb cassette containing intron 2 and splice donor/acceptor sites from the rabbit beta-globin gene (Arttamangkul et al., 2008Arttamangkul S. Quillinan N. Low M.J. von Zastrow M. Pintar J. Williams J.T. Differential activation and trafficking of micro-opioid receptors in brain slices.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The hD2S construct consisted of a consensus Kozak sequence, a signal peptide from the hemagglutinin influenza followed by the sequence for the FLAG epitope (Vickery and von Zastrow, 1999Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. Distinct dynamin-dependent and -independent mechanisms target structurally homologous dopamine receptors to different endocytic membranes.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), a full-length cDNA for the hD2S containing 1.4 kb of coding sequence and 1.0 kb of 3′ untranslated, and the bovine growth hormone polyA sequence from pcDNA 3.0 (Invitrogen). After cleavage by the signal peptidase of the signal sequence during translation, an hD2S protein with an amino terminus Flag epitope is expressed in TH-expressing neurons including the dopamine neurons of the midbrain, as shown by immunostaining with the M1 anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) using confocal microscopy on sections and two-photon microscopy on midbrain slice preparations (data not shown). CGP 35348 and 5-CT were obtained from Tocris Bioscience. Baclofen and sulpiride were obtained from Research Biochemical. MK-801 was obtained from Abcam. Cocaine hydrochloride was obtained from National Institute on Drug Abuse-National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Values are given as means ± SEM. All distributions with n > 30 were tested for normality with Shapiro-Wilk normality test. IPSC amplitude distributions were compared by two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. For clarity, histograms show amplitudes ≤30 pA, which accounts for >97% of all amplitudes measured in each condition. To normalize amplitude counts across conditions, the vertical axes of individual histograms have been scaled, such that the bin with the greatest count equals 1.0. Statistical significance was determined in two group comparisons by paired two-tailed t tests or two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests and in more than two groups comparisons by one-way ANOVAs, one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs, Kruskal-Wallis (nonparametric ANOVA), or Friedman test (nonparametric repeated-measures ANOVA) followed, when appropriate (p < 0.05), by Dunnett’s or Bonferroni’s post hoc tests or Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. A difference of p < 0.05 was considered significant (Prism 4 and AxoGraph X). We thank Dr. C.P. Ford for comments on the work and manuscript. Supported by NIH DA04523."
https://openalex.org/W1994603037,"Expression of the Down syndrome cell-adhesion molecule (Dscam) is increased in the brains of patients with several neurological disorders. Although Dscam is critically involved in many aspects of neuronal development, little is known about either the mechanism that regulates its expression or the functional consequences of dysregulated Dscam expression. Here, we show that Dscam expression levels serve as an instructive code for the size control of presynaptic arbor. Two convergent pathways, involving dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), control Dscam expression through protein translation. Defects in this regulation of Dscam translation lead to exuberant presynaptic arbor growth in Drosophila somatosensory neurons. Our findings uncover a function of Dscam in presynaptic size control and provide insights into how dysregulated Dscam may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1998822125,"Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are depolarized by light by two mechanisms: directly, through activation of their photopigment melanopsin; and indirectly through synaptic circuits driven by rods and cones. To learn more about the rod and cone circuits driving ipRGCs, we made multielectrode array (MEA) and patch-clamp recordings in wildtype and genetically modified mice. Rod-driven ON inputs to ipRGCs proved to be as sensitive as any reaching the conventional ganglion cells. These signals presumably pass in part through the primary rod pathway, involving rod bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells coupled to ON cone bipolar cells through gap junctions. Consistent with this interpretation, the sensitive rod ON input to ipRGCs was eliminated by pharmacological or genetic disruption of gap junctions, as previously reported for conventional ganglion cells. A presumptive cone input was also detectable as a brisk, synaptically mediated ON response that persisted after disruption of rod ON pathways. This was roughly three log units less sensitive than the rod input. Spectral analysis revealed that both types of cones, the M- and S-cones, contribute to this response and that both cone types drive ON responses. This contrasts with the blue-OFF, yellow-ON chromatic opponency reported in primate ipRGCs. The cone-mediated response was surprisingly persistent during steady illumination, echoing the tonic nature of both the rod input to ipRGCs and their intrinsic, melanopsin-based phototransduction. These synaptic inputs greatly expand the dynamic range and spectral bandpass of the non-image-forming visual functions for which ipRGCs provide the principal retinal input."

https://openalex.org/W2031978755,"To date, very large scale sequencing of many clinically important RNA viruses has been complicated by their high population molecular variation, which creates challenges for polymerase chain reaction and sequencing primer design. Many RNA viruses are also difficult or currently not possible to culture, severely limiting the amount and purity of available starting material. Here, we describe a simple, novel, high-throughput approach to Norovirus and Hepatitis C virus whole genome sequence determination based on RNA shotgun sequencing (also known as RNA-Seq). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by sequencing three Norovirus samples from faeces and two Hepatitis C virus samples from blood, on an Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencer. More than 97% of reference genomes were recovered. Compared with Sanger sequencing, our method had no nucleotide differences in 14,019 nucleotides (nt) for Noroviruses (from a total of 2 Norovirus genomes obtained with Sanger sequencing), and 8 variants in 9,542 nt for Hepatitis C virus (1 variant per 1,193 nt). The three Norovirus samples had 2, 3, and 2 distinct positions called as heterozygous, while the two Hepatitis C virus samples had 117 and 131 positions called as heterozygous. To confirm that our sample and library preparation could be scaled to true high-throughput, we prepared and sequenced an additional 77 Norovirus samples in a single batch on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer, recovering >90% of the reference genome in all but one sample. No discrepancies were observed across 118,757 nt compared between Sanger and our custom RNA-Seq method in 16 samples. By generating viral genomic sequences that are not biased by primer-specific amplification or enrichment, this method offers the prospect of large-scale, affordable studies of RNA viruses which could be adapted to routine diagnostic laboratory workflows in the near future, with the potential to directly characterize within-host viral diversity."

However, to date there has been no systematic study to determine which organs may be at risk, or the magnitude of any effect. We undertook a detailed cross-sectional health screen at a mean of 8 years after surgery in 35 asymptomatic patients who had previously received a metal-on-metal hip resurfacing (MoMHR) versus 35 individually age and sex matched asymptomatic patients who had received a conventional hip replacement. Total body bone mineral density was 5% higher (mean difference 0.05 g/cm2, P = 0.02) and bone turnover was 14% lower (TRAP 5b, mean difference −0.56IU/L, P = 0.006; osteocalcin, mean difference −3.08 ng/mL, P = 0.03) in the hip resurfacing versus conventional hip replacement group. Cardiac ejection fraction was 7% lower (mean absolute difference −5%, P = 0.04) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 6% larger (mean difference 2.7 mm, P = 0.007) in the hip resurfacing group versus those patients who received a conventional hip replacement. The urinary fractional excretion of metal was low (cobalt 5%, chromium 1.5%) in patients with MoMHR, but creatinine clearance was normal. Diuretic prescription was associated with a 40% increase in the fractional excretion of chromium (mean difference 0.5%, P = 0.03). There was no evidence of difference in neuropsychological, renal tubular, hepatic or endocrine function between groups (P>0.05). Our findings of differences in bone and cardiac function between patient groups suggest that chronic exposure to low elevated metal concentrations in patients with well-functioning MoMHR prostheses may have systemic effects. Long-term epidemiological studies in patients with well-functioning metal on metal hip prostheses should include musculoskeletal and cardiac endpoints to quantitate the risk of clinical disease."

We also evaluated whether the Mas receptor contributed for the protective effects of treatment with AT1 receptor blockers. ADR (10 mg/kg) induced significant renal injury and dysfunction that was maximal at day 14 after injection. Treatment with the Mas receptor agonist AVE 0991 improved renal function parameters, reduced urinary protein loss and attenuated histological changes. Renoprotection was associated with reduction in urinary levels of TGF-β. Similar renoprotection was observed after treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist, Losartan. AT1 and Mas receptor mRNA levels dropped after ADR administration and treatment with losartan reestablished the expression of Mas receptor and increased the expression of ACE2. ADR-induced nephropathy was similar in wild type (Mas(+/+) ) and Mas knockout (Mas (-/-)) mice, suggesting there was no endogenous role for Mas receptor activation. However, treatment with Losartan was able to reduce renal injury only in Mas(+/+) , but not in Mas (-/-) mice. Therefore, these findings suggest that exogenous activation of the Mas receptor protects from ADR-induced nephropathy and contributes to the beneficial effects of AT1 receptor blockade. Medications which target specifically the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis may offer new therapeutic opportunities to treat human nephropathies."

In this study, we identified the first confirmed clinical isolate of Escherichia coli BJ01 harboring blaNDM-1 in China. The isolate is highly resistant to all tested antimicrobials except polymyxin. blaNDM-1, blaCTX-M-57, and blaTEM-1 were identified in the isolate. blaNDM-1 was transferable to E. coli EC600 and DH5α in both plasmid conjugation experiments and plasmid transformation tests. BJ01 was identified as a new sequence type, ST224, by multilocus sequence typing. Analysis of genetic environment shows complex transposon-like structures surrounding the blaNDM-1 gene. Genetic analysis revealed that the region flanking blaNDM-1 was very similar to previously identified NDM-positive Acinetobacter spp. isolated in China. The findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of NDM-1-carrying Enterobacteriaceae in China."
https://openalex.org/W2069272353,"Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a well-established oncolytic agent against different types of tumors. MYXV is also known for its immunomodulatory properties in down-regulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I surface expression (via the M153R gene product, a viral E3-ubiquitin ligase) and suppressing T cell killing of infected target cells. MHC I down-regulation, however, favors NK cell activation. Brain tumors including gliomas are characterized by high MHC I expression with impaired NK activity. We thus hypothesized that MYXV infection of glioma cells will promote NK cell-mediated recognition and killing of gliomas. We infected human gliomas with MYXV and evaluated their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. MYXV enhanced NK cell-mediated killing of glioma cells (U87 cells, MYXV vs. Mock: 51.73% vs. 28.63%, P = .0001, t test; U251 cells, MYXV vs. Mock: 40.4% vs. 20.03%, P .0007, t test). Using MYXV M153R targeted knockout (designated vMyx-M153KO) to infect gliomas, we demonstrate that M153R was responsible for reduced expression of MHC I on gliomas and enhanced NK cell-mediated antiglioma activity (U87 cells, MYXV vs. vMyx-M153KO: 51.73% vs. 25.17%, P = .0002, t test; U251 cells, MYXV vs. vMyx-M153KO: 40.4% vs. 19.27, P = .0013, t test). Consequently, NK cell-mediated lysis of established human glioma tumors in CB-17 SCID mice was accelerated with improved mouse survival (log-rank P = .0072). These results demonstrate the potential for combining MYXV with NK cells to effectively kill malignant gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2166110010,"In contrast to freshwater fish it is presumed that marine fish are unlikely to spawn with close relatives due to the dilution effect of large breeding populations and their propensity for movement and reproductive mixing. Inbreeding is therefore not typically a focal concern of marine fish management. We measured the effective number of breeders in 6 New York estuaries for winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), a formerly abundant fish, using 11 microsatellite markers (6–56 alleles per locus). The effective number of breeders for 1–2 years was remarkably small, with point estimates ranging from 65–289 individuals. Excess homozygosity was detected at 10 loci in all bays (FIS = 0.169–0.283) and individuals exhibited high average internal relatedness (IR; mean = 0.226). These both indicate that inbreeding is very common in all bays, after testing for and ruling out alternative explanations such as technical and sampling artifacts. This study demonstrates that even historically common marine fish can be prone to inbreeding, a factor that should be considered in fisheries management and conservation plans."
https://openalex.org/W1991899392,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. It is a neurodegenerative and incurable disease that is associated with the tight packing of amyloid fibrils. This packing is facilitated by the compatibility of the ridges and grooves on the amyloid surface. The GxMxG motif is the major factor creating the compatibility between two amyloid surfaces, making it an important target for the design of amyloid aggregation inhibitors. In this study, a peptide, experimentally proven to bind Aβ40 fibrils at the GxMxG motif, was mutated by a novel methodology that systematically replaces amino acids with residues that share similar chemical characteristics and subsequently assesses the energetic favorability of these mutations by docking. Successive mutations are combined and reassessed via docking to a desired level of refinement. This methodology is both fast and efficient in providing potential inhibitors. Its efficiency lies in the fact that it does not perform all possible combinations of mutations, therefore decreasing the computational time drastically. The binding free energies of the experimentally studied reference peptide and its three top scoring derivatives were evaluated as a final assessment/valuation. The potential of mean forces (PMFs) were calculated by applying the Jarzynski‚s equality to results of steered molecular dynamics simulations. For all of the top scoring derivatives, the PMFs showed higher binding free energies than the reference peptide substantiating the usage of the introduced methodology to drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2030886886,"2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE47) is the dominant PBDE congener in humans, wildlife, and the environment. It has been reported to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Still, the effects of BDE47 on spermatogenesis failure are attracting an increasing amount of attention. However, it is unclear whether CYP-mediated metabolism contributes to BDE47-induced reproductive toxicity.The role of cytochrome P450 3A1 (CYP3A1) in the formation of oxidative metabolites of BDE47 and its induced spermatogenesis failure was investigated in SD rats. BDE47 significantly increased the expression and activity of CYP3A1 in rat liver, and 3-OH-BDE47, the major oxidative metabolite of BDE47, dose-dependently increased in rat liver, serum, and testis, which was aggravated by dexamethasone (DEX), an inducer of CYP3A1. Additionally, testicular 3-OH-BDE47 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in seminiferous tubules increased especially when BDE47 was administered in combination with DEX, which was confirmed in GC-1 and GC-2 cells that 3-OH-BDE47 induced more ROS production and cell apoptosis via the upregulation of FAS/FASL, p-p53 and caspase 3. As a result, daily sperm production dose-dependently decreased, consistent with histological observations in giant cells and vacuolar spaces and increase in TUNEL-positive apoptotic germ cells.CYP3A1-mediated metabolic activation of BDE47 and the active metabolite 3-OH-BDE47 and consequent ROS played an important role in reduction of spermatogenesis by germ cell apoptosis. Our study helps provide new insights into the mechanism of reproductive toxicity of environmental chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2090077902,"Background It is of importance to minimize ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury during liver operations. Reducing the inflammatory reaction is an effective way to achieve this goal. Notably, adiponectin (APN) was found to have anti-inflammatory activity in heart and renal I/R injury. Herein, we investigated the role of APN in liver I/R injury. Methods Wistar rats were randomized to four groups: (1) sham group; (2) I/R control group; (3) I/R+APN group; and (4) I/R+APN+AMPK inhibitor group. Liver and blood samples were collected 6h and 24h after reperfusion. Liver function and histopathologic changes were assessed. Macrophage and neutrophil infiltration was detected by immunohistochemistry staining, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released in the liver were measured using ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 expression in the liver. Downstream molecules of APN were investigated by Western blotting. Results Circulatory APN was down-regulated during liver I/R. When exogenous APN treatment was administered during liver I/R, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were decreased, and less hepatocyte necrosis was observed. Less inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines release were also observed in the I/R+APN group when compared with the I/R control group. APN treatment also reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, evidenced by reduced TUNEL positive cells and less caspase-3 expression in the reperfused liver. Finally, the AMPK/eNOS pathway was found to be activated by APN, and administration of an AMPK inhibitor reversed the beneficial effects of APN. Conclusion APN can protect the liver from I/R injury by reducing the inflammatory response and hepatocyte apoptosis, a process that likely involves the AMPK/eNOS pathway. The current study provides a potential pharmacologic target for liver I/R injury."

Receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are single-span transmembrane proteins that reverse reactions catalyzed by tyrosine kinases (TKs). A major problem in the phosphotyrosine signaling field is to identify and characterize ligands and coreceptors that interact with the extracellular (XC) domains of RPTPs and regulate their functions in vivo. The IIb, IIa, and III subtypes, comprising 11 of the 19 human RPTPs, have XC regions containing immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and fibronectin type III (FN3) repeats, which are found in cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (reviewed by Tonks, 2006Tonks N.K. Protein tyrosine phosphatases: from genes, to function, to disease.Nat. Rev. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Type IIb RPTPs are homophilic CAMs that regulate cadherin-mediated adhesion (Aricescu et al., 2007Aricescu A.R. Siebold C. Choudhuri K. Chang V.T. Lu W. Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Jones E.Y.

The type III RPTP PTPRB interacts with VE-cadherin in cis (Nawroth et al., 2002Nawroth R. Poell G. Ranft A. Kloep S. Samulowitz U. Fachinger G. Golding M. Shima D.T. Deutsch U. Vestweber D. VE-PTP and VE-cadherin ectodomains interact to facilitate regulation of phosphorylation and cell contacts.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and PTPRJ can bind to a fragment of the Syndecan-2 protein (Whiteford et al., 2011Whiteford J.R.

Dimeric placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins have been used to visualize ligand binding in situ for many receptors (Flanagan and Cheng, 2000Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins for molecular characterization and cloning of receptors and their ligands.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RPTP-AP probes derived from the XC domains of four Drosophila RPTPs (Ptp10D, Ptp69D, Ptp99A, and Lar), all stain CNS axons in live-dissected late stage 16 embryos. Lar-AP also stains muscle attachment sites. This provided the basis for a screen of deletion (Df) mutations in which we screened the Bloomington Stock Center Df “kit,” found a Df for which homozygotes lacked muscle attachment site staining with Lar-AP, and identified Sdc as the Lar ligand/coreceptor encoded within the deleted region (Fox and Zinn, 2005Fox A.N. Zinn K. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan is an in vivo ligand for the Drosophila LAR receptor tyrosine phosphatase.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1701-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This Df screen had two problems. First, homozygotes for many Dfs in the kit had severe CNS defects that preclude screening. To alleviate this, we replaced Dfs for which development failed with smaller Dfs that allow better development, creating a “phenotype Df kit” with which >80% of the genome can be screened for ligands (http://fly.bio.indiana.edu/Browse/df/zinn.php). This kit can also be used for systematic genome screening for any embryonic phenotype, and such a screen requires analysis of less than 400 lines (Wright et al., 2010Wright A.P. Fox A.N. Johnson K.G. Zinn K. Systematic screening of Drosophila deficiency mutations for embryonic phenotypes and orphan receptor ligands.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Second, if multiple RPTP ligands are expressed in overlapping patterns, deletion of a gene encoding one ligand might not produce a decrease in staining that can be unambiguously scored. For Lar-AP, deletion of Sdc only slightly reduces axonal staining. A Lar-AP mutant that cannot bind to HSPGs stained CNS axons with equal intensity in wild-type and Sdc embryos, indicating that Lar has non-HSPG axonal binding partners (Fox and Zinn, 2005Fox A.N.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1701-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe a screen that addresses the second problem. GAL4-dependent expression of Sdc on muscles conferred bright staining with Lar-AP (Fox and Zinn, 2005Fox A.N. Zinn K.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1701-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This suggested that if we ectopically expressed many cell-surface and secreted (CSS) proteins, potential ligands could be identified by ectopic staining with RPTP-AP probes. We had assembled a collection of lines bearing P element insertions with GAL4 binding sites upstream of 410 CSS protein genes in order to screen for genes involved in targeting of motor axons to muscle fibers (Kurusu et al., 2008Kurusu M.

Screening the CSS insertion lines for ectopic staining with Ptp10D-AP (10D-AP) identified a binding partner for Ptp10D, Stranded at second (Sas). The sas gene encodes two large cell-surface proteins of unknown function that are expressed on the apical surfaces of epithelially derived cells (Schonbaum et al., 1992Schonbaum C.P. Organ E.L. Qu S.

Biol. 1992; 151: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ptp10D is a type III RPTP. It is orthologous to a group of four mammalian RPTPs that negatively regulate receptor TKs (RTKs) by direct dephosphorylation (reviewed by Matozaki et al., 2010Matozaki T. Murata Y. Mori M. Kotani T.

Type III RPTPs can be tyrosine-phosphorylated on a C-terminal YxNΦ (Φ = hydrophobic) motif, and this causes activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) (Murata et al., 2010Murata Y. Mori M.

It also has the C-terminal YxNΦ motif. Ptp10D single mutants have no known embryonic phenotypes, but Ptp10D genetically interacts with other Rptp genes. The analysis of Ptp10D Ptp69D double mutants demonstrated that Ptp10D is involved in the control of axon guidance across the midline of the CNS (Sun et al., 2000Sun Q. Bahri S. Schmid A. Chia W.

In this paper, we show that Ptp10D binds to Sas in embryos and in vitro. Loss-of-function (LOF) genetic interaction studies show that Sas and Ptp10D act together in neurons to control longitudinal axon guidance. Signaling by Sas in glia is negatively regulated by its interactions with Ptp10D on neurons. To find potential ligands and coreceptors for Ptp10D, we used 10D-AP to stain embryos that ectopically expressed CSS proteins. The set of lines for CSS protein expression was originally assembled by creating a database of 976 CSS proteins that includes more than 80 types of XC domains, then collecting lines bearing insertions of UAS-containing (EP-like) elements in the 5′ ends of 410 of the genes (Kurusu et al., 2008Kurusu M.

In wild-type stage 16 embryos, 10D-AP brightly stains axons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and brain (Figure 1C), but body wall staining is weak and has no clear pattern (Figures 1D and 1E). We searched for insertion lines that produced embryos displaying strong staining of muscle fibers and/or increased staining of cell bodies and axons in the VNC. One line, GE24911, reproducibly conferred strong ectopic staining of muscle fibers and increased VNC staining intensity. This line has an insertion of an EP-like GE element 226 bp 5′ to the transcription start site of sas (Schonbaum et al., 1992Schonbaum C.P. Organ E.L. Qu S. Cavener D.R. The Drosophila melanogaster stranded at second (sas) gene encodes a putative epidermal cell surface receptor required for larval development.Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of ectopic Sas expression showed that 24B-GAL4 is weaker in the double driver line than as a single driver, suggesting that we might have missed some genes due to insufficient ectopic expression. Accordingly, we repeated the entire screen using a strong pancellular driver, tubulin (tub)-GAL4, and identified nine other candidate binding partners (Figure S1). We do not yet know if these are genuine Ptp10D ligands or coreceptors, as their binding to Ptp10D has not been examined by “reverse” staining of embryos (see below) or by in vitro binding. Interestingly, one is Ptp10D itself, indicating that the Ptp10D XC domain may have homophilic binding activity. This was also observed in a cell aggregation assay (see below). sas encodes two cell-surface proteins of 1,693 and 1,348 amino acids (aa). The mRNA for the larger isoform includes an alternatively spliced exon encoding a 345 aa sequence that is inserted at aa 929. Sas proteins have two XC domains with defined structures: a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain (aa ∼750–825) and two FN3 repeats (aa ∼1,400–1,600). There is a single predicted transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain of 37 aa (Schonbaum et al., 1992Schonbaum C.P. Organ E.L. Qu S. Cavener D.R. The Drosophila melanogaster stranded at second (sas) gene encodes a putative epidermal cell surface receptor required for larval development.Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Western blotting of Sas from embryos reveals multiple bands between 100 kD and 220 kD, suggesting that there are extracellular Sas proteins that lack transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences. Sas does not have an obvious vertebrate ortholog, but there are numerous vertebrate proteins with VWC domains and FN3 repeats homologous to those in Sas. To confirm that Sas was responsible for ectopic binding of 10D-AP to embryos from GE24911 crosses, we made transgenic lines containing a UAS-linked cDNA construct encoding the large Sas isoform. When these were crossed to a variety of GAL4 driver lines, we observed ectopic 10D-AP staining in patterns that corresponded to the expression patterns of the drivers. Ventrolateral and ventral muscles were brightly labeled by 10D-AP in embryos expressing Sas from the 24B-GAL4 driver (Figures 1F and 1G). Embryos expressing Sas in glia from Repo-GAL4 showed increased 10D-AP staining along peripheral nerves (Figures 1H and 1I). Embryos expressing Sas from 5053A-GAL4, which is selectively expressed in muscle 12, displayed ectopic 10D-AP staining only on that muscle (Figures 1J and 1K). We compared 10D-AP and anti-Sas staining in ectopic expression embryos, and found that the two patterns were superimposable (Figure S2). Although ectopic 10D-AP staining is observed wherever Sas is overexpressed, Sas is not required for axonal staining by 10D-AP. In embryos homozygous for a sas point mutation or a Df that removes sas, a normal axonal pattern of 10D-AP staining was observed (data not shown). This indicates that Ptp10D has other binding partners (see Figure S1). The fact that ectopic Sas expression confers ectopic staining with an exogenous Ptp10D fusion protein does not prove that Sas itself binds to Ptp10D. To determine whether exogenous Sas can interact with endogenous Ptp10D, we performed reverse staining experiments, incubating embryos with purified Sas-Fc, a dimeric human Fc fusion protein containing the XC domain of the large Sas isoform. In live-dissected wild-type embryos, we observed only weak staining with Sas-Fc, and we could not see changes in the staining pattern when we ectopically expressed Ptp10D using the Ptp10DEP1172 insertion line. We then made the surprising observation that genetic removal of the other Drosophila type III RPTP, Ptp4E, which is widely expressed in embryos (Jeon et al., 2008Jeon M. Nguyen H. Bahri S. Zinn K. Redundancy and compensation in axon guidance: genetic analysis of the Drosophila Ptp10D/Ptp4E receptor tyrosine phosphatase subfamily.Neural Dev. 2008; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Oon et al., 1993Oon S.H. Hong A. Yang X. Chia W. Alternative splicing in a novel tyrosine phosphatase gene (DPTP4E) of Drosophila melanogaster generates two large receptor-like proteins which differ in their carboxyl termini.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23964-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowed visualization of ectopic Ptp10D by staining with Sas-Fc. The simplest explanation for this effect is that heterodimerization of Ptp4E with Ptp10D blocks Sas binding, but we have no evidence that such heterodimers exist. Figures 2A–2H show double staining of the VNC with Sas-Fc and an anti-Ptp10D monoclonal antibody (mAb). In wild-type embryos, faint staining of CNS axons with Sas-Fc was observed (Figure 2B). This was increased in intensity in a Ptp4E mutant (Figure 2D). In a Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutant, no Ptp10D protein is present (Figure 2E), and the intensity of staining with Sas-Fc was reduced relative to the Ptp4E single mutant (Figure 2F), suggesting that Ptp10D is one of the major binding partners for Sas-Fc on CNS axons. When Ptp10D was overexpressed on all neurons in a Ptp4E mutant background using the Elav-GAL4 driver, Ptp10D and Sas-Fc staining intensities were increased (Figures 2G and 2H). Sas-Fc stained body walls weakly in Ptp4E mutant embryos (Figure 2J). However, when Ptp10D was pancellularly expressed in the Ptp4E mutant background using tub-GAL4, bright Sas-Fc staining (and anti-Ptp10D staining) was observed on muscle fibers, and VNC staining intensity was increased (Figures 2K and 2L). These data show that Sas and Ptp10D can interact with each other in embryos, but do not demonstrate that they can bind to each other in the absence of other cofactors. To evaluate this issue, we analyzed interactions between Sas and Ptp10D in vitro. We examined binding in vitro between Sas and Ptp10D using a modified ELISA assay and the AlphaScreen (Perkin-Elmer), which measures interactions between proteins bound to beads. For studies of interactions between cell surface proteins, these methods are superior to assays such as two-hybrid, GST pulldown, cell aggregation, and cell adhesion-to-substrate. Two-hybrid and GST pulldown assays produce unreliable results with XC domains because they lack normal disulfide bond formation and glycosylation when expressed within yeast or bacterial cells, and cell aggregation and cell adhesion-to-substrate assays cannot demonstrate that proteins interact in the absence of cellular cofactors. The modified ELISA assay was developed for analysis of Dscam interactions (Wojtowicz et al., 2007Wojtowicz W.M. Wu W. Andre I. Qian B. Baker D. Zipursky S.L. A vast repertoire of Dscam binding specificities arises from modular interactions of variable Ig domains.Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although we obtained robust signals with Dscam positive controls, our initial attempts to measure binding of Sas to Ptp10D produced weak signals. We made some modifications to the assay that increased its signal-to-noise ratio by ∼10-fold (see Experimental Procedures), and were then able to readily demonstrate selective Sas-Ptp10D interactions. Figure 3A shows the results of an experiment in which purified Sas-Fc was used alone (blank) or mixed at an ∼1:1 molar ratio with three different RPTP XC domain fusion proteins: 10D-AP, Ptp69D-AP (69D-AP), or Lar-AP. All proteins were made using the baculovirus system. Eight identical replicates of each binding reaction were assessed. Binding was observed only for the Sas::Ptp10D pair. The mean signal value for Sas::Ptp10D was 30- to 43-fold higher than for any of the three controls, and these differences were highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001). These data show that Sas binds to Ptp10D and not to other RPTP-AP fusion proteins, but do not address the possibility that 10D-AP is “sticky” and can bind nonselectively to any Fc fusion protein. To evaluate this, we conducted the experiment in Figure 3B, in which 10D-AP was mixed at an ∼1:1 molar ratio with two other Fc fusion proteins, Unc5-Fc and Fasciclin II (FasII)-Fc, with one of the controls from the Figure 3A experiment, Sas-Fc::Lar-AP, serving as the blank. Eight identical replicates of each binding reaction were assessed. As in Figure 3A, binding was observed only between Ptp10D and Sas. The mean signal value for Sas::Ptp10D was 13- to 32-fold higher than for the two Fc controls, and the differences were highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001 for both the Unc5::10D and FasII::10D controls). The AlphaScreen relies on a proximity-dependent chemical reaction to measure binding between two proteins bound to “donor” and “acceptor” beads. This assay can work well for low-affinity interactions, because the high concentrations of protein on the beads facilitate bead-bead interactions via avidity effects. Cell-cell interactions mediated by adhesion molecules are strongly influenced by avidity. Indeed, the AlphaScreen worked extremely well for Dscam, which is a homophilic adhesion molecule. The signal due to homophilic binding of the 7.13.25 isoform was 178-fold higher than that for heterophilic binding of 7.13.25 to 7.8.25, which differs only in exon 3 (see Wojtowicz et al., 2007Wojtowicz W.M.

A vast repertoire of Dscam binding specificities arises from modular interactions of variable Ig domains.Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar for nomenclature). We were also able to detect concentration-dependent binding of Sas to Ptp10D using the AlphaScreen. However, the signal-to-background ratio (Sas-Fc::10D-AP versus Sas-Fc::69D-AP or Sas-Fc::blank) was only ∼6-fold (Figure S3), so this assay was inferior to the ELISA for this ligand-receptor pair. These results show that Sas and Ptp10D selectively interact with each other, but do not define whether their in vivo interactions are likely to be in cis (between proteins on the same cell surface), in trans (between proteins on different cell surfaces), or both. We used a cell aggregation assay to evaluate whether Ptp10D and Sas can interact in trans. This was done by making stable Schneider 2 (S2) cell lines expressing full-length Ptp10D and a Sas-mCD8-GFP fusion protein. Ptp10D-expressing cells formed small clusters (Figure 3C), consistent with the observation that 10D-AP binds to ectopically expressed Ptp10D in embryos (Figure S1). Sas-expressing cells did not aggregate (Figure 3D). When the cell lines were mixed, we observed Ptp10D-expressing cell clusters that were associated with one to several Sas-expressing cells (Figure 3E). These cells sometimes formed straight interfaces with Ptp10D cells that are suggestive of adhesi"

https://openalex.org/W2132009680,"Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) produced by Campylobacter jejuni comprises a heterotrimeric complex formed by CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC. Among these toxin subunits, CdtA and CdtC function as essential proteins that mediate toxin binding to cytoplasmic membranes followed by delivery of CdtB into the nucleus. The binding of CdtA/CdtC to the cell surface is mediated by cholesterol, a major component in lipid rafts. Although the putative cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) domain of CDT has been reported from several bacterial pathogens, the protein regions contributing to CDT binding to cholesterol in C. jejuni remain unclear. Here, we selected a potential CRAC-like region present in the CdtC from C. jejuni for analysis. Molecular modeling showed that the predicted functional domain had the shape of a hydrophobic groove, facilitating cholesterol localization to this domain. Mutation of a tyrosine residue in the CRAC-like region decreased direct binding of CdtC to cholesterol rather than toxin intermolecular interactions and led to impaired CDT intoxication. These results provide a molecular link between C. jejuni CdtC and membrane-lipid rafts through the CRAC-like region, which contributes to toxin recognition and interaction with cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1997586510,"nfxB encodes a negative regulator of the mexCD-oprJ genes for drug efflux in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivating mutations in this transcriptional regulator constitute one of the main mechanisms of resistance to ciprofloxacin (Cipr). In this work, we evaluated the use of nfxB/Cipr as a new test system to study mutation spectra in P. aeruginosa. The analysis of 240 mutations in nfxB occurring spontaneously in the wild-type and mutator backgrounds or induced by mutagens showed that nfxB/Cipr offers several advantages compared with other mutation detection systems. Identification of nfxB mutations was easy since the entire open reading frame and its promoter region were sequenced from the chromosome using a single primer. Mutations detected in nfxB included all transitions and transversions, 1-bp deletions and insertions, >1-bp deletions and duplications. The broad mutation spectrum observed in nfxB relies on the selection of loss-of-function changes, as we confirmed by generating a structural model of the NfxB repressor and evaluating the significance of each detected mutation. The mutation spectra characterized in the mutS, mutT, mutY and mutM mutator backgrounds or induced by the mutagenic agents 2-aminopurine, cisplatin and hydrogen peroxide were in agreement with their predicted mutational specificities. Additionally, this system allowed the analysis of sequence context effects since point mutations occurred at 85 different sites distributed over the entire nfxB. Significant hotspots and preferred sequence contexts were observed for spontaneous and mutagen-induced mutation spectra. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of a luminescence-based reporter for identification of nfxB mutants previous to sequencing analysis. Thus, the nfxB/Cipr system in combination with the luminescent reporter may be a valuable tool for studying mutational processes in Pseudomonas spp. wherein the genes encoding the NfxB repressor and the associated efflux pump are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2085019921,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ranks among the top ten most prevalent cancers worldwide. Like most head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), OSCC is highly inflammatory and aggressive. However, the signaling pathways triggering the activation of its inflammatory processes remain elusive. G protein-coupled receptor signaling regulates the inflammatory response and invasiveness of cancers, but it remains unclear whether Gα12 is a critical player in the inflammatory cytokine pathway during the tumorigenesis of OSCC. This study was undertaken to determine the role of Gα12 signaling in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in their mediation of OSCC invasion. We found that both the transcription and protein levels of Gα12 are up-regulated in OSCC tumors. The elevated Gα12 expressions in OSCC patients also correlated with extra-capsular spread, an indicator of tumor invasiveness in HNSCCs. This clinical finding was supported by the studies of overexpression and RNAi knockdown of Gα12 in OSCC cells, which demonstrated that Gα12 promoted tumor cell migration and invasion. To understand how Gα12 modulates OSCC invasiveness, we analyzed key biological processes in microarray data upon depletion of Gα12 and found that cytokine- and other immune-related pathways were severely impaired. Importantly, the mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-8 proinflammatory cytokines in clinical samples were found to be significantly correlated with the increased Gα12 levels, suggesting a potential role of Gα12 in modulating the IL-6 and IL-8 expressions. Supporting this hypothesis, overexpression or RNAi knockdown of Gα12 in OSCC cell lines both showed that Gα12 positively regulated the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8. Finally, we demonstrated that the Gα12 promotion of tumor cell invasiveness was suppressed by the neutralization of IL-6 and IL-8 in OSCC cells. Together, these findings suggest that Gα12 drives OSCC invasion through the up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2055291245,"During rat postnatal development, gastric cell proliferation and differentiation depend on many elements, which include dietary pattern, hormones, growth factors and their signaling pathways. Among them, EGFR activity is increased through MAPK and Src cascades in response to early weaning that represents the abrupt transition from milk to solid food. We herein investigated the direct involvement of ERK pathway in the control of cell cycle progression during early weaning, and studied the specific role of p27. At 15 days, Wistar rats were separated from dams, fed with powdered chow and daily injected with PD98059 (MEK inhibitor, 300 µg/kg) or 0.5% DMSO (control). By using HE staining and immunohistochemistry for PCNA, we respectively detected mitotic (MI) and proliferative (PI) indices in 18-day-old pups, and observed that both were reduced by PD98059. As cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin E, CDK2, cyclin D1, CDK4, p21 and p27) are involved in proliferative regulation, we compared samples obtained at 17 days in the morning (17 d) and evening (17.5 d). We found that they were not altered after ERK inhibition, but cyclin D1, p21 and p27 levels changed throughout the day in the control group. As p27 activity depends on its integrity, we studied p27 phosphorylation (threonin 187), and observed that ERK inhibition reduced this process. We suggest that MAPK pathway interferes in the regulation of p27 function in the gastric mucosa during early weaning, possibly by controlling its degradation, and altogether this mechanism might contribute to the increase of epithelial proliferation at this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2041939076,"Despite recent pharmaceutical advancements in therapeutic drugs, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease. Recently, ploy(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) has been shown as a potentially promising target for MM therapy. A previous report suggested bufalin, a component of traditional Chinese medicine (“Chan Su”), might target PARP1. However, this hypothesis has not been verified. We here showed that bufalin could inhibit PARP1 activity in vitro and reduce DNA–damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in MM cells. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the active site of bufalin interaction is within the catalytic domain of PAPR1. Thus, PARP1 is a putative target of bufalin. Furthermore, we showed, for the first time that the proliferation of MM cell lines (NCI-H929, U266, RPMI8226 and MM.1S) and primary CD138+ MM cells could be inhibited by bufalin, mainly via apoptosis and G2-M phase cell cycle arrest. MM cell apoptosis was confirmed by apoptotic cell morphology, Annexin-V positive cells, and the caspase3 activation. We further evaluated the role of PARP1 in bufalin-induced apoptosis, discovering that PARP1 overexpression partially suppressed bufalin-induced cell death. Moreover, bufalin can act as chemosensitizer to enhance the cell growth-inhibitory effects of topotecan, camptothecin, etoposide and vorinostat in MM cells. Collectively, our data suggest that bufalin is a novel PARP1 inhibitor and a potentially promising therapeutic agent against MM alone or in combination with other drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2065466424,"The formation of protein inclusions is frequently associated with chronic metabolic diseases. In mice, short-term intoxication with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) leads to hepatocellular damage indicated by elevated serum liver enzyme activities, whereas only minor morphological changes are observed. Conversely, chronic administration of DDC for several weeks results in severe morphological damage, characterized by hepatocellular ballooning, disruption of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, and formation of Mallory-Denk bodies consisting predominantly of misfolded keratins, Sqstm1/p62, and heat shock proteins. To evaluate the mechanistic underpinnings for this dichotomy we dissected the time-course of DDC intoxication for up to 10 weeks. We determined body weight change, serum liver enzyme activities, morphologic alterations, induction of antioxidant response (heme oxygenase-1, HO-1), oxidative damage and ATP content in livers as well as respiration, oxidative damage and the presence and activity of HO-1 in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (mtHO-1). Elevated serum liver enzyme activity and oxidative liver damage were already present at early intoxication stages without further subsequent increase. After 2 weeks of intoxication, mice had transiently lost 9% of their body weight, liver ATP-content was reduced to 58% of controls, succinate-driven respiration was uncoupled from ATP-production and antioxidant response was associated with the appearance of catalytically active mtHO-1. Oxidative damage was associated with both acute and chronic DDC toxicity whereas the onset of chronic intoxication was specifically associated with mitochondrial dysfunction which was maximal after 2 weeks of intoxication. At this transition stage, adaptive responses involving mtHO-1 were induced, indirectly leading to improved respiration and preventing further drop of ATP levels. Our observations clearly demonstrate principally different mechanisms for acute and chronic toxic damage."
https://openalex.org/W2166462591,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an eight subunit protein complex conserved in all higher eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the CSN regulates auxin response by removing the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8/RUB1 from the CUL1 subunit of the SCFTIR1/AFB ubiquitin-ligase (deneddylation). Previously described null mutations in any CSN subunit result in the pleiotropic cop/det/fus phenotype and cause seedling lethality, hampering the study of CSN functions in plant development. In a genetic screen to identify enhancers of the auxin response defects conferred by the tir1-1 mutation, we identified a viable csn mutant of subunit 3 (CSN3), designated eta7/csn3-3. In addition to enhancing tir1-1 mutant phenotypes, the csn3-3 mutation alone confers several phenotypes indicative of impaired auxin signaling including auxin resistant root growth and diminished auxin responsive gene expression. Unexpectedly however, csn3-3 plants are not defective in either the CSN-mediated deneddylation of CUL1 or in SCFTIR1-mediated degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. These findings suggest that csn3-3 is an atypical csn mutant that defines a novel CSN or CSN3-specific function. Consistent with this possibility, we observe dramatic differences in double mutant interactions between csn3-3 and other auxin signaling mutants compared to another weak csn mutant, csn1-10. Lastly, unlike other csn mutants, assembly of the CSN holocomplex is unaffected in csn3-3 plants. However, we detected a small CSN3-containing protein complex that is altered in csn3-3 plants. We hypothesize that in addition to its role in the CSN as a cullin deneddylase, CSN3 functions in a distinct protein complex that is required for proper auxin signaling."

Via the presentation of viral peptide ligands at the cell surface, class I HLA mediate the T cell recognition and killing of WNV infected cells. At this time, there are two key unknowns in regards to understanding protective T cell immunity: 1) the number of viral ligands presented by the HLA of infected cells, and 2) the distribution of T cell responses to these available HLA/viral complexes. Here, comparative mass spectroscopy was applied to determine the number of WNV peptides presented by the HLA-A*11:01 of infected cells after which T cell responses to these HLA/WNV complexes were assessed. Six viral peptides derived from capsid, NS3, NS4b, and NS5 were presented. When T cells from infected individuals were tested for reactivity to these six viral ligands, polyfunctional T cells were focused on the GTL9 WNV capsid peptide, ligands from NS3, NS4b, and NS5 were less immunogenic, and two ligands were largely inert, demonstrating that class I HLA reduce the WNV polyprotein to a handful of immune targets and that polyfunctional T cells recognize infections by zeroing in on particular HLA/WNV epitopes. Such dominant HLA/peptide epitopes are poised to drive the development of WNV vaccines that elicit protective T cells as well as providing key antigens for immunoassays that establish correlates of viral immunity."

Both sites are significantly enriched in either quantitative PCR or massively parallel sequencing assays. A site in intron 5 acts as a classical enhancer in transient assays, but does not require the consensus motif for activity, suggesting a redundant or modulatory role for Zfp423 binding in this context. We speculate that Zfp423 may repress this enhancer as part of a developmental ratchet."
https://openalex.org/W2047629328,"Contactless atmospheric pressure ionization (C-API) method has been recently developed for mass spectrometric analysis. A tapered capillary is used as both the sampling tube and spray emitter in C-API. No electric contact is required on the capillary tip during C-API mass spectrometric analysis. The simple design of the ionization method enables the automation of the C-API sampling system. In this study, we propose an automatic C-API sampling system consisting of a capillary (∼1 cm), an aluminium sample holder, and a movable XY stage for the mass spectrometric analysis of organics and biomolecules. The aluminium sample holder is controlled by the movable XY stage. The outlet of the C-API capillary is placed in front of the orifice of a mass spectrometer, whereas the sample well on the sample holder is moved underneath the capillary inlet. The sample droplet on the well can be readily infused into the C-API capillary through capillary action. When the sample solution reaches the capillary outlet, the sample spray is readily formed in the proximity of the mass spectrometer applied with a high electric field. The gas phase ions generated from the spray can be readily monitored by the mass spectrometer. We demonstrate that six samples can be analyzed in sequence within 3.5 min using this automatic C-API MS setup. Furthermore, the well containing the rinsing solvent is alternately arranged between the sample wells. Therefore, the C-API capillary could be readily flushed between runs. No carryover problems are observed during the analyses. The sample volume required for the C-API MS analysis is minimal, with less than 1 nL of the sample solution being sufficient for analysis. The feasibility of using this setup for quantitative analysis is also demonstrated."

The perception of emotions is not only influenced by a person’s ethnic background but also depends on whether a person is engaged with the emotion-encoder. Although these factors are known to affect emotion perception, their impact has only been studied in isolation before. The aim of the present study was to investigate their combined influence. Thus, in order to study the influence of engagement on emotion perception between persons from different ethnicities, we compared participants from China and Germany. Asian-looking and European-looking virtual agents expressed anger and happiness while gazing at the participant or at another person. Participants had to assess the perceived valence of the emotional expressions. Results indicate that indeed two factors that are known to have a considerable influence on emotion perception interacted in their combined influence: We found that the perceived intensity of an emotion expressed by ethnic in-group members was in most cases independent of gaze direction, whereas gaze direction had an influence on the emotion perception of ethnic out-group members. Additionally, participants from the ethnic out-group tended to perceive emotions as more pronounced than participants from the ethnic in-group when they were directly gazed at. These findings suggest that gaze direction has a differential influence on ethnic in-group and ethnic out-group dynamics during emotion perception."

However, little is known about the sense of position of the vertical distance between finger pads relative to each other. We quantified subjects' ability to match perceived vertical distance between the thumb and index finger pads (dy ) of the right hand (""reference"" hand) using the same or opposite hand (""test"" hand) after a 10-second delay without vision of the hands. The reference hand digits were passively placed non-collinearly so that the thumb was higher or lower than the index finger (dy = 30 or -30 mm, respectively) or collinearly (dy = 0 mm). Subjects reproduced reference hand dy by using a congruent or inverse test hand posture while exerting negligible digit forces onto a handle. We hypothesized that matching error (reference hand dy minus test hand dy ) would be greater (a) for collinear than non-collinear dy s, (b) when reference and test hand postures were not congruent, and (c) when subjects reproduced dy using the opposite hand. Our results confirmed our hypotheses. Under-estimation errors were produced when the postures of reference and test hand were not congruent, and when test hand was the opposite hand. These findings indicate that perceived finger pad distance is reproduced less accurately (1) with the opposite than the same hand and (2) when higher-level processing of the somatosensory feedback is required for non-congruent hand postures. We propose that erroneous sensing of finger pad distance, if not compensated for during contact and onset of manipulation, might lead to manipulation performance errors as digit forces have to be modulated to perceived digit placement."

https://openalex.org/W2106474422,"Demyelination is generally regarded as a consequence of oligodendrocytic cell death. Oligodendrocyte processes that form myelin sheaths may, however, degenerate and regenerate independently of the cell body, in which case cell death does not necessarily occur. We provide here the first evidence of retraction and regeneration of oligodendrocyte processes with no cell death in vitro, using time-lapse imaging. When processes were severed mechanically in vitro, the cells did not undergo cell death and the processes regenerated in 36 h. In a separate experiment, moderate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) stimuli caused process retraction without apparent cell death, and the processes regained their elaborate morphology after NMDA was removed from the culture medium. These results strongly suggest that demyelination and remyelination can take place without concomitant cell death, at least in vitro. Process regeneration may therefore become a target for future therapy of demyelinating disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1999167459,"This study aimed to determine if 50 days of canola oil intake in the absence or presence of salt loading affects: (1) antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, (2) aortic mRNA of NADPH oxidase (NOX) subunits and superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms and (3) endothelial function in SHRSP rats. SHRSP rats were fed a diet containing 10 wt/wt% soybean oil or 10 wt/wt% canola oil, and given tap water or water containing 1% NaCl for 50 days. Without salt, canola oil significantly increased RBC SOD, plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, aortic p22phox, NOX2 and CuZn-SOD mRNA, and decreased RBC glutathione peroxidase activity. With salt, canola oil reduced RBC SOD and catalase activity, LDL-C, and p22phox mRNA compared with canola oil alone, whereas plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced and RBC MDA and LDL-C were higher. With salt, the canola oil group had significantly reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilating responses to ACh and contractile responses to norepinephrine compared with the canola oil group without salt and to the WKY rats. These results indicate that ingestion of canola oil increases O2− generation, and that canola oil ingestion in combination with salt leads to endothelial dysfunction in the SHRSP model."

https://openalex.org/W2088657940,"When two tones are presented in a short time interval, the response to the second tone is suppressed. This phenomenon is referred to as forward suppression. To address the effect of the masker laterality on forward suppression, magnetoencephalographic responses were investigated for eight subjects with normal hearing when the preceding maskers were presented ipsilaterally, contralaterally, and binaurally. We employed three masker intensity conditions: the ipsilateral-strong, left-right-balanced, and contralateral-strong conditions. Regarding the responses to the maskers without signal, the N1m amplitude evoked by the left and binaural maskers was significantly larger than that evoked by the right masker for the left-strong and left-right-balanced conditions. No significant difference was observed for the right-strong condition. Regarding the subsequent N1m amplitudes, they were attenuated by the presence of the left, binaural, and right maskers for all conditions. For the left- and right-strong conditions, the subsequent N1m amplitude in the presence of the left masker was smaller than those of the binaural and right maskers. No difference was observed between the binaural and right masker presentation. For left-right-balanced condition, the subsequent N1m amplitude decreased in the presence of the right, binaural, and left maskers in that order. If the preceding activity reflected the ability to suppress the subsequent activity, the forward suppression by the left masker would be superior to that by the right masker for the left-strong and left-right-balanced conditions. Furthermore, the forward suppression by the binaural masker would be expected to be superior to that by the left masker owing to additional afferent activity from the right ear. Thus, the current results suggest that the forward suppression by ipsilateral maskers is superior to that by contralateral maskers although both maskers evoked the N1m amplitudes to the same degree. Additional masker at the contralateral ear can attenuate the forward suppression by the ipsilateral masker."
