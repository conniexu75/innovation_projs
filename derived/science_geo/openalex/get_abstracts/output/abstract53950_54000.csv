https://openalex.org/W1591872616,"Abstract Some of the characteristics of adenyl cyclase activity and its response to the stimulatory agents, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and fluoride ion, were investigated in rat fat cell ghosts. ACTH and fluoride ion stimulated the activity of the same enzyme. The membrane-bound enzyme was unstable at 0 and 37° and was inactivated by trypsin. Of several monovalent cations tested, lithium ion inhibited the basal, ACTH-, and fluoride-stimulated activities of the enzyme. Potassium ion, at 10 mm, specifically enhanced the response of the enzyme to ACTH; this effect of potassium was abolished by sodium ion (100 mm). The enzyme required a divalent ion for activity; among several divalent cations tested, Mn++, Mg++, and Co++ were effective. Mn++ (5 mm) stimulated basal and fluoride activities but not ACTH activity which showed a preference for Mg++. Ca++ inhibited adenyl cyclase activity; ACTH and fluoride ion reduced the concentration necessary to obtain 50% inhibition from 2.0 mm to 0.75 and 0.40 mm, respectively. The affinity of adenyl cyclase for Mg++ was increased in the presence of ACTH and fluoride ion, whereas the affinity for ATP was not changed. The kinetic characteristics of the basal, ACTH-, and fluoride-stimulated activities of the enzyme in the presence of Mg++ indicated that adenyl cyclase has two binding sites for Mg++, one of which is at the catalytic site and the other at some site that is altered by the actions of ACTH and fluoride ion and which enhances, allosterically, the reaction of the catalytic site with its substrate, MgATP. Although both ACTH and fluoride affected the same kinetic parameter (increased affinity for Mg++), the following differences were observed in their characteristics of activation: (a) Fluoride- and ACTH-stimulated activities were affected differently in the presence of potassium and manganous ions; (b) ACTH concentration curves were hyperbolae whereas fluoride concentration curves were sigmoids; (c) the concentration of ACTH giving half-maximal stimulation (apparent Km) was only slightly affected by temperature, whereas the apparent Km for fluoride activation was changed from 0.9 mm at 37° to 2.0 mm at 30°. It was concluded that ACTH and fluoride ion activate the same enzyme and alter the same kinetic parameter involved in activation, but do so by different means."

When sleep-waking cycles are reversed by 12 hours, the release of growth hormone with sleep is reversed; thus release does not follow an inherent circadian rhythm independent of sleep."

It digests reconstituted collagen fibrils and reduces the viscosity of collagen solutions. Cleavage of collagen in solution with purified enzyme produces the discrete products characteristic of other animal collagenases."
https://openalex.org/W1578024134,"Abstract Among several lipolytic hormones tested, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), epinephrine, glucagon, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone stimulated adenyl cyclase activity in a plasma membrane-rich fraction, termed ghosts, isolated from rat fat cells. The effects given by various combinations of these hormones, at maximally stimulating concentrations, were not additive, indicating that a single enzyme was activated by all of these hormones. Different effects of the combined hormones were found depending upon the condition of incubation. At 37°, the combined hormones either did not give greater effects or gave smaller effects than that of the most effective hormone. At 30° in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, each hormone potentiated the effect of the other. The effects on adenyl cyclase activity of combinations of the hormones at concentrations near their apparent Km of activation displayed noncompetitive kinetics. Propranolol, a β receptor antagonist, blocked completely the stimulatory action of epinephrine but did not alter the actions of the peptide hormones. An analogue of ACTH inhibited, specifically and competitively, the stimulatory actions of ACTH both on adenyl cyclase activity in ghosts and on lipolysis in intact fat cells. It was concluded from these findings that the hormones act at discrete hormone-specific sites (or receptors) that affect the activity of a single adenyl adenyl cyclase in fat cells."
https://openalex.org/W1601083871,"Crude particulate preparations from castor bean endosperm contain most of the β oxidation activity present in initial extracts. Measurements on organelles separated by sucrose density centrifugation of the crude particles show that glyoxysomes (density 1.25) contain more than 80% of the particulate β oxidation activity, with virtually none in the mitochondria (density 1.19). Thiolase shows a similar distribution. Glyoxysomes do not oxidize NADH, but O2 is required for β oxidation. Addition of palmitoyl coenzyme A to glyoxysomes results in O2 uptake, NADH accumulation, and acetyl-CoA production, in a 0.5:1:1 stoichiometry. Cyanide has no effect on NADH accumulation, but doubles the rate of O2 uptake. These data are consistent with an O2-requiring oxidation of the prosthetic group of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to yield H2O2, which is broken down by catalase in the glyoxysome. Acetyl-CoA produced by β oxidation is consumed in the glyoxylate cycle, which is also located in this organelle."

Antigen was found in the blood of 98 percent of 130 patients, with the serum form of hepatitis, from whom multiple samples were obtained. Antibodies arising during hepatitis are usually combined with antigen and cause anticomplementary activity in the serum, which is reversible with excess antigen or antibody. Tests for antigen and specific anticomplementary activity can be used diagnostically and to screen blood donors for hepatitis carriers."

These diagrams make the general features of the pH and pMg dependences readily discernible and summarize the results of some 2500 calculations per diagram. There are significant changes in the heat evolved by these reactions over this range of the independent variables. Equations are derived which make it possible to calculate the standard entropy of reaction ΔS0obs from the entropy change of the reaction written in terms of particular ionic species, entropy changes of the various acid and metal ion dissociation reactions, the entropies of mixing of the various forms of each reactant and product, and the entropies of dilution of H+ and Mg2+. The relative contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the equilibrium constants of these reactions may be accessed from the diagrams as a function of pH and pMg."

The rate of the enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation of histone was increased by about 300% at concentrations of cyclic AMP above 7 x 10-7 m. The apparent Km of the E. coli enzyme for cyclic AMP was about 2 x 10-7 m."

https://openalex.org/W1595569274,"Abstract The possible roles of fatty acids in the regulation of gluconeogenesis and in the gluconeogenic action of glucagon were investigated in the isolated perfused rat liver. Oleate in complex with albumin did not alter glucose production or 14C-glucose formation in livers from fed rats perfused with saturating or lower concentrations of 14C-lactate. It also did not affect glucose utilization or 14C-glucose disappearance in livers from fed or fasted rats perfused with 18 mm 14C-glucose. Unbound oleate, infused at the rate of 2 µmoles per min in livers from fed rats, increased ketogenesis 3-fold but did not alter glucose production or gluconeogenesis. At a rate of 4 µmoles per min, it increased ketogenesis 5-fold, glucose synthesis from lactate by 50%, and total glucose production by about 30%. The stimulation of gluconeogenesis disappeared at still higher infusion rates although marked ketogenesis and glycogenolysis still occurred. Unbound oleate frequently produced detectable increases in tissue adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Unbound octanoate infused at 5 µmoles per min increased ketogenesis, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and cyclic AMP accumulation. Carnitine did not affect the rates of glucose production, gluconeogenesis, or ketogenesis in livers from fed rats and did not alter the effects of unbound oleate on these processes. In livers from fasted rats in which gluconeogenesis had been inactivated by an initial perfusion without substrate, oleate in complex with Fraction V serum albumin increased glucose formation from lactate by about 30% and enhanced glycogen deposition and ketogenesis. Some albumin samples had a stimulatory effect on gluconeogenesis which was unaltered by removal of fatty acids. Infusions of unbound oleate or octanoate increased gluconeogenesis by 50% and reduced or did not alter glycogen formation. Ketogenesis was stimulated manyfold. In contrast to the above effects of fatty acids, glucagon increased gluconeogenesis from lactate more than 2-fold but did not stimulate ketogenesis in livers from fed or fasted rats. The gluconeogenic effect of oleate-albumin complex or unbound oleate was additive with that of a maximally effective concentration of glucagon. Mechanisms proposed for the gluconeogenic and ketogenic actions of glucagon are discussed. It is concluded that fatty acids probably do not play a physiological role in the rapid regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and that glucagon does not stimulate gluconeogenesis by activating hepatic lipolysis. The physiological regulation of ketogenesis appears to involve primarily the control of fatty acid supply to the liver, i.e. the regulation of lipolysis in fat tissue. Regulation by glucagon at the hepatic level is of minor importance."
https://openalex.org/W1576801442,"Surface membranes were isolated by the fluorescein mercuric acetate and Tris procedures from mouse fibroblasts (L cells) grown in suspension culture. Membranes isolated by the fluorescein mercuric acetate method contained approximately 4.7% of the protein and 13.8% of the lipid of the whole cell. Approximately 95% of the plasma membrane lipid was accounted for. Comparison of lipid-protein ratios for whole cells and surface membranes shows a 3-fold enrichment of lipid in the surface membrane. Neutral lipids make up 40% of the total membrane lipid, with cholesterol and triglycerides accounting for 20 and 13%, respectively. The high cholesterol content of the surface membrane is reflected in a cholesterol-phospholipid molar ratio of 0.69 while the corresponding ratio for total cell lipid is 0.26. Fifty-nine per cent of the membrane phospholipids contain choline, and the surface membranes contain more sphingomyelin and less lecithin and phosphatidylethanolamine than the total cell lipid. Phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin show a 2- to 3-fold enrichment of unsaturated and long chain fatty acids relative to other membrane phospholipids. The lipid composition of the surface membranes of L cells was compared to the composition reported in the literature for surface membranes of animal cells. The comparison indicates that the lipid compositions of L cell and liver cell surface membranes are basically similar. Lipid composition may be useful in classifying surface membrane preparations."

https://openalex.org/W2059480547,"The perfused small intestine from a vitamin D deficient rat exhibits about one-half the calcium transport of the intestine from a rat given vitamin D. These levels of calcium transport can be maintained for at least 4 hours. Addition of 2.5 micrograms of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol added to the vitamin D deficient intestine via the arterial blood perfusate induces a rise in calcium transport to +D levels within 2 hours. In contrast, 250 micrograms of vitamin D(3) given in the same manner has no effect on the calcium transport level overa 4-hour period. These data provide strong evidence that 25-hydroxycholecalci ferol represents the metabolically active form of vitamin D(3)."
https://openalex.org/W1526234433,"A neurotoxin, designated toxin α, has been isolated from the venom of the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje haje) by gradient chromatography on Amberlite CG-50, and has been further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. Homogeneity was verified by free boundary electrophoresis, acrylamide gel electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, amino acid analysis, and end group analysis. Toxin α has a sedimentation constant, s020, w, of 1.18 S, a diffusion constant, D20, w of 14.07 × 10−7 cm2 sec−1, electrophoretic mobilities of 6.02 × 10−5, 2.94 × 10−5, and 2.84 × 10−5 cm2 sec−1 volt−1 at pH 5.0, 6.8, and 8.3, respectively, and a formula weight of 6834.6. Ultracentrifugation studies indicate that the reduced, S-carboxymethylated toxin is capable of dimer formation. Chemical studies show that toxin α is a small, basic protein consisting of a single polypeptide chain of 61 amino acid residues, cross-linked by four disulfide bridges. Alanine, methionine, and phenylalanine are totally absent. The complete amino acid sequence of the neurotoxin was determined by analyzing tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of the S-carboxymethyl derivative of the neurotoxin. Alignment with the partially determined structure of the probably homologous neurotoxin α from Naja nigricollis indicates eight amino acid differences between the two neurotoxins."

https://openalex.org/W1525840716,"Abstract Insulin did not stimulate glucose metabolism or inhibit lipolysis in brown fat cells isolated by digestion of rat interscapular brown adipose tissue with collagenase plus 1 mg of trypsin per ml. Trypsin-treated cells responded normally to catecholamines and to the antilipolytic agent, prostaglandin E1. The stimulation of respiration by lipolytic agents and free fatty acids was not affected by trypsin digestion, but the potentiation of octanoate-induced respiration by was abolished. Incubation of white adipose tissue from rats with trypsin plus collagenase abolished the ability of to inhibit lipolysis and stimulate glucose metabolism but did not affect the antilipolytic action of prostaglandin E1. Trypsin-treated white fat cells metabolized less glucose than cells isolated with collagenase alone but had a normal response to lipolytic agents such as theophylline, growth hormone plus dexamethasone, and catecholamines. The failure of trypsin-treated cells to respond to was not due to destruction of because medium containing which had been incubated with trypsin-treated fat cells stimulated the metabolism of glucose by cells isolated with collagenase only. Trypsin treatment abolished the stimulation of white fat cell glucose metabolism seen in the presence of bound insulin but not that due to oxytocin. These studies indicate that trypsin treatment selectively inactivates the response of fat cells to and bound insulin, but not to oxytocin, prostaglandin E1, or lipolytic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1546325090,"Abstract Tryptophan oxygenase (l-tryptophan:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.1.12) was purified to a state of homogeneity from substrate-induced Pseudomonas acidovorans. The sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of the homogeneous protein are s20,w, 6.26 x 10-13 sec, and D20,w, 4.78 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, and from these values a molecular weight, Ms,d, of 121,000 is obtained. High and low speed equilibrium sedimentation experiments give molecular weights, Mequil, of 118,000 and 123,000, respectively. Amino acid analyses reveal no sulfur-containing amino acid residues other than methionine. Quantitative analytical data show 1 mole of ferriprotoporphyrin IX and only trace amounts of copper and nonheme iron per mole of holoenzyme. The major absorption bands in the optical spectrum of the native holoenzyme occur at 280 and 405 mµ, and the specific absorbance values (E1 cm0.1%) are 1.20 and 1.88, respectively. Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral data indicate that the single protoheme iron moiety of both the native (ferric) and the chemically reduced (ferrous) form of the holoenzyme exists predominantly in the high spin configuration. Any of three kinds of treatment (alkaline pH, guanidinium chloride, or sodium dodecyl sulfate) results in dissociation of the native protein into subunits which are devoid of enzymatic activity and which have profoundly altered optical spectra. The subunit species produced in each case appear monodisperse by velocity and equilibrium sedimentation criteria and are characterized by the following sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) and molecular weights (Mequil): alkaline pH, 2.46 S and 31,300; guanidinium chloride, 1.73 S and 33,200; sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2.67 S and 35,800. These data indicate that native tryptophan oxygenase is composed of a single heme moiety affixed to a protein molecule containing four polypeptide chains, of essentially equivalent mass, which are stabilized in a specific tetrameric structure exclusively by noncovalent interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2010553364,"Neurogenic secretion of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla in rabbits, induced by administration of insulin, caused decreases in both the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity and the catecholamine content of the storage vesicle fraction. After sedimentation through a sucrose density gradient, the storage vesicles obtained from insulin-treated animals had the same density and the same ratio of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase to catecholamine as did vesicles from untreated animals. These and other data indicate that neurogenic secretion from the adrenal medulla occurs by an all-or-none release from the storage vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1569093478,"Abstract The stimulatory effects of epinephrine, glucagon, and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) upon lipolysis and on the uptake and oxidation of glucose were studied in isolated rat epididymal adipocytes. Under conditions in which prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and nicotinic acid were antilipolytic against epinephrine, these agents were without influence on the effects of the hormone on the metabolism of glucose. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of caffeine and theophylline on epinephrine-induced lipolysis were not seen in studies of epinephrine-stimulated glucose oxidation. Since epinephrine increased the uptake and oxidation of glucose under conditions which either did (presence of bovine serum albumin) or did not (absence of bovine serum albumin) permit accumulation of free fatty acids, it is unlikely that free fatty acids mediate the effects of epinephrine on glucose entry and oxidation in adipocytes. Since two β-adrenergic blocking agents, Ko 592 and propranolol, inhibited epinephrine's stimulation of both lipolysis and glucose oxidation, it appears that both effects of the hormone involve β-receptors. While PGE1, Ko 592, and propranolol all inhibited the stimulatory effects of glucagon and ACTH on lipolysis in adipocytes, neither agent influenced the action of either hormone on glucose oxidation; the latter finding suggests that β-receptors do not mediate the stimulatory effects of these hormones on glucose oxidation. Ko 592 and propranolol were several orders of magnitude more potent as antilipolytic agents against epinephrine than they were against ACTH and glucagon. Excessive amounts of PGE1 only partially inhibited the lipolytic effect of even submaximal concentrations of epinephrine, glucagon, and ACTH in adipocytes, although total inhibitions were obtainable with appropriate concentrations of the β-adrenergic blocking compounds. Such observations suggest that the adenyl cyclase system for the synthesis of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in adipocytes contains at least two different types of activation receptor sites for hormones, and that PGE1 binds to only one type of site while the β-adrenergic blockers are effective against both types. The present, and previous, data permit the conclusion that epinephrine, ACTH, and glucagon stimulate the entry and over-all oxidation of glucose in adipocytes by a mechanism which is distinct from that (or those) by which these hormones promote lipolysis."

Crystallization of the purified enzyme-protein was achieved without change of its catalytic activity. The molecular weight, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium, was found to be 88,000. Kinetic data for the assessment of Km, competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors, and activation energy are presented. The homogeneous protein had 1 mole of NAD+ tightly bound per mole of enzyme; addition of NAD+ to incubation mixtures did not increase enzymatic activity. With sufficient amounts of purified enzyme, substrate-dependent appearance of fluorescence was shown. The fluorescence spectrum was typical for protein-bound NADH, suggesting the possibility of participation in the hydrogen transfer at one stage of the enzymatic reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1629894354,"Abstract The inhibition by orthophosphate of glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase and inorganic pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activities of rat liver glucose 6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) has been studied in detail. Significant inhibitions of both activities were noted over the entire range of pH values studied—pH 5.0 to 7.5 (hydrolase) or pH 5.0 to 6.5 (phosphotransferase). The detergents cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Cetrimide) and lysolecithin significantly lowered Ki values for Pi with both activities. For example, at pH 7.5, a Ki value of 18 mm was noted in the absence of detergents, while preliminary treatment of microsomes with Cetrimide, to 0.05% (w/v), reduced this value to 2.0 mm, and inclusion of 0.4 mm lysolecithin in assay mixtures led to a decrease in Ki to 4.6 mm. Because of differences in the extents of accompanying modifying effects of detergents on Km values for substrates, net inhibition by Pi of glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity was considerably more extensively potentiated by detergents than was that of phosphotransferase activity. Both in the absence and presence of detergents, inhibitions were kinetically competitive with respect to glucose 6-phosphate and pyrophosphate and non-competitive with respect to glucose in the phosphotransferase reaction. The mutually competitive nature of interactions of orthophosphate with adenosine triphosphate, bicarbonate, and pyrophosphate noted in inhibition studies carried out with phosphohydrolase activity also was shown. A physiologically significant regulatory role for Pi, through its effects on activities of this enzyme, is suggested on the basis of these experimental observations."

https://openalex.org/W1607012984,"Animal cells have been considered relatively impermeable to exogenous 3′,5′-AMP. The transport of 3′,5′-AMP-8-14C from plasma to bile and its metabolism were studied in 28 isolated rat livers perfused for 4 hours. The concentration of radioactivity in plasma, bile, and CO2 was determined at 30-min intervals after 3′,5′-AMP-8-14C (3 to 30 µCi) was injected into the portal vein or added to the perfusate. Approximately 13% of the radioactivity was recovered in bile and 3% appeared as 14CO2. Maximal 14CO2 production occurred during the initial 30 min after addition of the tracer dose. 3′,5′-AMP and metabolites were isolated from plasma and bile by ascending paper and ion exchange chromatography. Eluates of the paper and ion exchange chromatograms were measured by scintillation counting. The predominant nucleotide during the initial 30-min bile collection was 3′,5′-AMP and represented 2.9% of the administered radioactivity. In later bile collections, the radioactivity of this spot markedly decreased, while additional distinct radioactive metabolites developed. These data support the hypothesis that some 3′,5′-AMP is capable of penetrating the hepatic cell membrane and indicate that exogenous 3′,5′-AMP is rapidly metabolized by the liver."

In addition to the well known blue protein, a colorless component was found. The latter protein lacks oxidase activity, has a relatively low copper content, and is immunologically similar to apoceruloplasmin. It constitutes from 10 to 20% of the total ceruloplasmin found in normal serum. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of ceruloplasmin and its antibody precipitate were found to be identical. Therefore, antibodies could be used to isolate ceruloplasmin from serum for electron paramagnetic resonance studies. An antibody precipitate of all of the ceruloplasmin from a sample of serum contained two species of paramagnetic copper. The colorless ceruloplasmin appears to contain the type of copper which gives an electron paramagnetic resonance signal with a broad hyperfine structure."

The enzyme, which was purified approximately 710-fold, was shown to have a molecular weight of approximately 160,000, and did not contain activity for any of the amino acids commonly occurring in protein except l-cysteine. Optimum conditions for enzyme activity, such as substrate concentration, ion requirements, temperature, and pH were determined. Catalytic activity of the synthetase was not impaired by p-chloromercuribenzoate or iodoacetamide.
