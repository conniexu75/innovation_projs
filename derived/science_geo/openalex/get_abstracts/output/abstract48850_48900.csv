https://openalex.org/W2088135095,"Direct microinjection has been used to introduce foreign DNA into a number of terminally differentiated cell types as well as embryos of several species including sea urchin, Candida elegans, Xenopus, Drosophila and mice. Various genes have been successfully introduced into mice including constructs consisting of the mouse metallothionein-I (MT) promoter/regulator region fused to either the rat or human growth hormone (hGH) structural genes. Transgenic mice harbouring such genes commonly exhibit high, metal-inducible levels of the fusion messenger RNA in several organs, substantial quantities of the foreign growth hormone in serum and enhanced growth. In addition, the gene is stably incorporated into the germ line, making the phenotype heritable. Because of the scientific importance and potential economic value of transgenic livestock containing foreign genes, we initiated studies on large animals by microinjecting the fusion gene, MT-hGH, into the pronuclei or nuclei of eggs from superovulated rabbits, sheep and pigs. We report here integration of the gene in all three species and expression of the gene in transgenic rabbits and pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2008422577,"The in vitro splicing reactions of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in a yeast extract were analyzed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Labeled pre-mRNA appears in a 40S peak only if the pre-mRNA undergoes the first of the two partial splicing reactions. RNA analysis after extraction of glycerol gradient fractions shows that lariat-form intermediates, molecules that occur only in mRNA splicing, are found almost exclusively in this 40S complex. Another reaction intermediate, cut 5' exon RNA, can also be found concentrated in this complex. The complex is stable even in 400 mM KCl, although at this salt concentration, it sediments at 35S and is clearly distinguishable from 40S ribosomal subunits. This complex, termed a ""spliceosome,"" is thought to contain components necessary for mRNA splicing; its existence can explain how separated exons on pre-mRNA are brought into contact."
https://openalex.org/W2071769765,"The product of the yeast MAT alpha 2 gene, alpha 2 protein, negatively regulates expression of a class of yeast cell type specific genes, the a-specific genes. In this paper we show that alpha 2 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein. It recognizes a 32 base pair DNA sequence (operator) located upstream of an a-specific gene, STE6. A strongly homologous sequence is present upstream of each of the other four known a-specific genes. A synthetic STE6 operator, when placed in a test promoter (CYC1), brings the promoter under negative control by alpha 2 in vivo. This operator brings about repression when it is placed between the CYC1 upstream activation sequence (UAS) and the transcription start and when it is placed upstream of the UAS, outside the promoter. Thus, the operator need not overlap with essential promoter sequences to permit repression by alpha 2."
https://openalex.org/W1604295453,"A strain of Escherichia coli originally isolated from urine of a patient with acute pyelonephritis was studied in detail for binding to glycosphingolipids. Bacteria labeled metabolically with [14C]glucose were layered over a glycolipid chromatogram and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The detection was down to a few ng of glycolipid (pmol level) under these assay conditions. At a test level of 500 ng all glycolipids (more than a dozen molecular species analyzed) with Gal alpha 1----4Gal as an internal or terminal part bound the bacteria strongly while glycolipids known to lack this sequence were negative. Conformational analysis using hard sphere calculations including the exo-anomeric effect showed a bend in the saccharide chain at this disaccharide with a largely hydrophobic surface of the convex side, probably being part of the binding epitope. Mixtures of glycolipids isolated from a human ureter scraping and from urinary sediments bound bacteria in the 2- to 7-sugar interval. Thus, this infectious strain of E. coli recognizes glycolipids being present in epithelial cells lining the urinary tract."
https://openalex.org/W1536062643,"Consistent with its specialized role in DNA synthesis, the activity of ribonucleotide reductase is cell cycle-dependent, reaching its maximum during S-phase. This paper demonstrates, however, the levels of the two protein subunits, M1 and M2, of this enzyme vary independently of one another. The level of protein M1 was determined by use of a two-site monoclonal antibody-enzyme immunoassay and found to be constant throughout the cell cycle in bovine kidney MDBK cells. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the half-life of protein M1 was 15 h. This contrasts with our previous results demonstrating an S-phase-correlated increase in the concentration of protein M2 and a half-life of this subunit of 3 h. Therefore, ribonucleotide reductase is controlled during the cell cycle by the level of protein M2."
https://openalex.org/W2018562021,"An endogenous polypeptide of rat brain has been identified that is capable of displacing 1,4-benzodiazepines and the esters of the 3-carboxylic acid derivatives of beta-carbolines from their specific synaptic binding sites. This polypeptide was termed diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI). Previous studies have shown that DBI injected intraventricularly in rodents elicits ""proconflict"" responses and antagonizes the ""anticonflict"" action of benzodiazepines. An antiserum to this peptide, directed toward an immunodeterminant near its amino terminus, makes it possible to detect, measure, and study the neuronal location of this peptide in rat brain. In the rat cerebral cortex, DBI immunoreactivity is located in neurons that are not GABAergic (GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid); in the cerebellum and hippocampus, however, it might be present also in GABAergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2016641591,"Phospholipids are synthesized and concomitantly inserted on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Assembly of the phospholipid bilayer requires translocation to the lumenal monolayer. The hypothesis that rat liver microsomes contain a protein transporter, or “flippase,” for phosphatidylcholine was tested by measuring the transport of sn-1,2,-dibutyroylphosphatidylcholine (diC4PC). This homolog retains the polar head group, the portion of the phospholipid unable to undergo spontaneous transmembrane movement in vesicles, and its water solubility permits application of standard transport methods. DiC4PC entered the lumenal compartment of microsomal vesicles. Transport was saturable and was dependent on time, amount of microsomes, and an intact permeability barrier. DC4PC transport was inhibited by structural analogs (but not by sn-2,3-diC4PC) and by treatment of microsomes with proteases, N-ethyimaleimide, and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. These data suggest that the transmicrosomal movement of diC4PC is protein mediated. DiC4PC was not transported across PC vesicles or red cell membranes, where PC translocation is slow."

https://openalex.org/W1537251380,"The 24-kilodalton messenger RNA cap-binding protein (CBP) was purified from the rabbit reticulocyte postribosomal supernatant fraction using an affinity resin consisting of the p-aminophenyl gamma-ester of m7GTP coupled to Sepharose. The affinity-purified CBP was used to raise a goat antiserum. Anti-CBP antibodies were purified by adsorption to CBP coupled to either Controlled-Pore Glass or diazobenzyloxymethyl paper. The affinity-purified antibodies reacted specifically with only the 24-kilodalton polypeptide in whole reticulocyte lysate and in initiation factors prepared from the same source. During a conventional (nonaffinity) purification of CBP from a high salt extract of the ribosomal pellet, immunological reactivity paralleled the ability to reverse cap analogue inhibition of translation, indicating that the 24-kilodalton polypeptide present in the postribosomal supernatant fraction is immunologically cross-reactive with the CBP purified from ribosomes. Fractionation of whole reticulocyte lysate by sucrose gradient sedimentation followed by immunoblotting revealed that CBP was present in the supernatant fraction and the region of the gradient corresponding to ribosomal subunits but not in mono- or polysomes. The CBP to ribosome ratio was found to be approximately 0.02, assuming that the m7GTP-Sepharose retains all of the protein. This is considerably lower than that of other initiation factors and suggests that CBP may be the limiting polypeptide factor involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. The antibodies also inhibited the translation of a capped messenger RNA (globin). Inhibition of the translation of an uncapped RNA (satellite tobacco necrosis virus) was also observed, but to a lesser degree than with globin mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2032508482,"We have altered the TACTAAC sequence in the yeast CYH2m gene intron to TACTACC. This mutation changes the nucleotide at the normal position of the branch in intron RNA lariats produced during pre-mRNA splicing, and it prevents splicing in vivo. In a yeast pre-mRNA splicing system, CYH2m pre-mRNA carrying the TACTACC mutation is not specifically cut or rearranged in any way. Substitution of an A for the first G of the CYH2m intron, converting the highly conserved GTATGT 5′ splice site sequence to ATATGT, also blocks intron excision in vivo and in vitro: pre-mRNA carrying this mutation was still cut normally at the mutant 5′ splice site in vitro, to give authentic exon 1 and an intron-exon 2 lariat RNA with an A-A 2′–5′ phosphodiester linkage at the branch point. This lariat RNA is a dead-end product. The subsequent cleavage at the 3′ splice site is therefore sensitive to the sequence of the 5′ end of the intron attached at the branch point."
https://openalex.org/W2079762088,"The CDC17 gene product performs an essential stage-specific function during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. When cdc17-1 strains are grown at the maximum permissive temperature, recombination is induced preferentially in the genetic interval of the chromosome closest to the telomere. Telomeres are longer in cdc17 strains than in CDC17 strains at the permissive temperature because of addition of sequence near or in the poly (C1–3A) telomeric DNA and become even longer when cells are propagated at elevated temperatures. The mitotic recombination events require RAD52 function, but telomere growth does not. Long telomeres are maintained for many generations when crossed into a CDC17++ background, suggesting that telomere length is largely conserved during replication. The altered- telomere length phenotype of cdc17 mutations is recessive and coreverts and cosegregates with the temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2045737218,"The interconversion of mating types in yeast is initiated by an endonuclease encoded by the HO gene. HO is transcribed only transiently during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as cells undergo START. A deletion analysis of HO 5'-flanking DNA suggests that there must be multiple copies of the sequence that confers START-specific transcription in the interval from -150 to -900. Analysis of this interval revealed 10 occurrences of sequences that closely match the consensus Pur N N Pyr C A C G A4. To test whether these sequences are the putative cell-cycle control elements, synthetically derived copies of the consensus were inserted at the break points of constitutive deletions and shown to restore START-dependent cell-cycle control."

https://openalex.org/W2038531531,"Primary cultures of astrocytes from neonatal rat brain were incubated with tritiated serotonin. After fixation they were stained by immunofluorescence for the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein and processed for autoradiography. Silver grain density was increased over cells positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and was reduced to background levels when sodium was omitted from the medium or the specific inhibitors of serotonin uptake fluoxetine and chlorimipramine were present. The results indicate that mammalian astrocytes can take up serotonin by a sodium-dependent, high-affinity system previously thought to be the exclusive property of serotonergic nerve endings."
https://openalex.org/W2063328094,"Endothelial cells, which line the interior walls of blood vessels, proliferate at the site of blood vessel injury. Knowledge of the factors that control the proliferation of these cells would help elucidate the role of endothelial cells in wound healing, tumor growth, and arteriosclerosis. In vitro, endothelial cells organize into viable, three-dimensional tubular structures in environments that limit cell proliferation. The process of endothelial cell organization was found to result in decreased levels of the sis messenger RNA transcript and increased levels of the messenger RNA transcript for fibronectin. This situation was reversed on transition from the organized structure to a proliferative monolayer. These results suggest a reciprocity for two biological response modifiers involved in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1978941276,"Homothallic yeast cells undergo a specific pattern of mating-type switching initiated by an endonuclease encoded by the HO gene. HO transcription is affected by cell type (a, α, and a/α), by cell age (mother or daughter), and by the cell cycle. This paper investigates the sequences involved in HO transcription by replacing genomic DNA with copies mutated in vitro. A region between -1000 and 1400 (called URSi) is necessary for transcription in addition to a “TATA”-like region at -90. The 900 by of DNA separating URS1 from the “TATA” box is not necessary for transcription nor for a/α repression and some measure of mother/daughter control, but it is necessary for correct cell-cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W1575440037,"The synthesis of osteocalcin, the major non-collagenous protein of adult bone, was examined in cultures of 21-day fetal rat calvariae. Osteocalcin was measured by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay. Osteocalcin concentration in unincubated calvariae was 14.5 +/- 0.5 ng/calvaria. After incubation, there was a continuous increase in bone and medium osteocalcin, and by 96 h the values were about 100% higher than in unincubated calvariae. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) at 10(-11) to 10(-8)M increased osteocalcin synthesis. The effect appeared as early as 6 h after treatment and was primarily observed in the culture medium, and 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated osteocalcin up to 9-fold by 96 h. Concomitant with the effect on osteocalcin synthesis, 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited collagen synthesis. Cycloheximide markedly decreased osteocalcin concentrations in control and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated calvariae. The stimulatory effect on osteocalcin synthesis was specific to 1,25-(OH)2D3 since 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, parathyroid hormone, epidermal growth factor, and prostaglandin E2 did not stimulate osteocalcin synthesis, and parathyroid hormone and epidermal growth factor opposed the 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulatory effect. Insulin did not alter osteocalcin concentration by itself but enhanced the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3. In conclusion, 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates osteocalcin synthesis in cultures of normal calvariae, but this effect is not shared by other hormones known to affect bone metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1593430615,"In the present study we examined the role of glucose in the regulation of its own transport activity in the cultured 3T3 fat cell. A regulatory control of glucose became apparent after these cells were cultured in the absence of glucose. Glucose deprivation of the cells was accompanied by a specific time and protein synthesis-dependent increase in dGlc (2-deoxyglucose) uptake (up to 5-fold), which was due to an increase in the apparent Vmax of the transport system. Concomitantly, the stimulatory effect of insulin on hexose uptake almost completely disappeared. Addition of glucose to the glucose-deprived cells rapidly reversed the deprivation effects. Cycloheximide experiments revealed that the glucose deprivation-induced increase in hexose uptake required protein synthesis as well as a protein synthesis-independent response to glucose deprivation that retarded the turnover of hexose transport activity. Taken together, these data indicate that glucose deprivation is accompanied by retardation of the rate of degradation, internalization, or inactivation of hexose transporters while the increase in dGlc uptake requires at least the continuation of protein synthesis-dependent de novo synthesis, insertion, or activation of hexose transporters. Hexose competitively taken up with dGlc, including the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 3-O-methylglucose, could replace glucose in the process of prevention and reversal of the deprivation effects, indicating that competitive transport but not the metabolism of hexose is a prerequisite for the regulatory effect of glucose on the activity of its own transport system. In conclusion, our results indicate that in cultured 3T3 fat cells glucose itself is involved in the regulation of the activity of its own transport system by influencing the rate of degradation, internalization, or inactivation of hexose transporters by a protein synthesis-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1492378731,"Abstract Two closely related isoforms of acyl carrier protein (I and II) have been purified from spinach leaves. Differences in the N-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid composition indicate that these proteins are coded by different genes. The two spinach leaf isoforms have been resolved and characterized by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, by thin layer isoelectric focusing, and by differences in mobility upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both isoforms are effectively bound by antibodies raised to acyl carrier protein I. However, in competition experiments isoform II is only about 40% effective in blocking isoform I binding to antibody. Therefore, the isoforms are immunologically related but hold only some antigenic sites in common. Immunoblot analysis (Western blotting) of crude spinach leaf tissue extracts probed with antibody to acyl carrier protein I reveals both isoforms. In addition, both forms of acyl carrier protein are present in dark-grown leaf tissue and in isolated chloroplasts. However, in spinach seeds and roots only acyl carrier protein II can be detected. Similar results are observed with extracts of castor oil plant leaf and seed. Therefore, the expression of the two acyl carrier protein isoforms is tissue specific."
https://openalex.org/W1989070313,A specific antibody to acetylcholine was raised and used as a marker for cholinergic neurons in the rat central nervous system. The acetylcholine conjugate was obtained by a two-step immunogen synthesis procedure. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test the specificity and affinity of the antibody in vitro; the results indicated high affinity. A chemical perfusion mixture of allyl alcohol and glutaraldehyde was used to fix the acetylcholine in the nervous tissue. Peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunocytochemistry showed many acetylcholine-immunoreactive cells and fibers in sections from the medial septum region.
https://openalex.org/W1996774505,"Synthesis and release of pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides are under differential regulation in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary. Glucocorticoids inhibit synthesis of pro-opiomelanocortin-related peptides in the anterior lobe but not in the intermediate lobe. These two lobes are also characterized by differences in neural innervation and blood flow, both of which may represent routes of access for regulatory factors (the intermediate lobe is avascular). Immunoreactive glucocorticoid receptor, which can be demonstrated in many tissues, is absent from the intermediate lobe. Immunocytochemistry was used to demonstrate the presence of immunoreactive glucocorticoid receptor in the intermediate lobe after pituitary stalk transection, neurointermediate lobe grafts to kidney capsule, or monolayer culture of neurointermediate pituitary cells. This appearance of the glucocorticoid receptor is presumably a consequence of removal of intermediate pituitary cells from neural influences that may be responsible for inhibiting their expression under normal conditions in vivo."

Our results show that differentiation potential does not always segregate during cleavage in a linear fashion, i.e., a blastomere can express a differentiation potential that is absent in its parent blastomere and vice versa. Furthermore, the expression of a particular differentiation program by certain cleavage-arrested blastomeres is an exclusive event in that each cell will express only one program of differentiation, even though it may have the potential to express several."
https://openalex.org/W1490603915,"The prothrombin activator present in the venom of the mainland tiger snake (Notechis scutatus scutatus) was purified to homogeneity by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200 followed by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sephadex. The venom activator has an apparent molecular weight of 54,000. It consists of a heavy chain (Mr = 32,000) and a light chain (Mr = 23,000) held together by one or more disulfide bridges. The active site is located at the heavy chain region of the molecule. The venom activator contains 8 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues/molecule. Gel electrophoretic analysis of prothrombin activation indicates that the venom activator is capable of cleaving both the Arg 274-Thr 275 and Arg 323-Ile 324 bonds of bovine prothrombin. The order of bond cleavage appears to be random since prethrombin-2 and meizothrombin occur as intermediates during prothrombin activation. Prothrombin activation by the venom activator alone is very slow. This is explained by the unfavorable kinetic parameters for the reaction (Km for prothrombin = 105 microM, Vmax = 0.0025 nmol of prothrombin activated per min/microgram of venom activator). Phospholipids plus Ca2+ and Factor Va greatly stimulate venom-catalyzed prothrombin activation. In the presence of 50 microM phospholipid vesicles composed of 20 mol % phosphatidylserine and 80 mol % phosphatidylcholine, the Km drops to 0.2 microM, whereas there is hardly any effect on the Vmax. Factor Va causes a 3,500-fold increase of the Vmax (8.35 nmol of prothrombin activated per min/microgram of venom activator) and a 10-fold decrease of the Km (9.5 microM). The most favorable kinetic parameters are observed in the presence of both 50 microM phospholipid and Factor Va (Km = 0.16 microM, Vmax = 27.9 nmol of prothrombin activated per min/microgram of venom activator). These changes of the kinetic parameters explain the stimulatory effects of Factor Va and phospholipid on venom-catalyzed prothrombin activation. The venom activator slowly converts the Factor Xa-specific chromogenic substrates CH3SO2-D-leucyl-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide and N-benzoyl-L-isoleucyl-L-glutamyl-(piperidyl)-glycyl-L-arginyl-p-nitroani lide hydrochloride. Factor Va causes a 7-fold stimulation of chromogenic substrate conversion by the venom activator. This stimulation appears to be the result of the formation of a tight 1:1 complex between the venom activator and Factor Va."

During this switch, trypanosomes simultaneously expressed both pre- and postswitch VSG's uniformly over their surface as detected with monoclonal antibodies. Analysis of this switching event showed that trypanosomes expressing any one of three distinct preswitch VSG's could switch to expression of from one to three different postswitch VSG's. Up to 2.7 percent of the trypanosome population was in the process of switching at one time."
https://openalex.org/W1606613045,"Equilibrium dialysis and protection from heat inactivation and proteolysis show that initiation factor 2 (IF-2) interacts not only with GTP but also with GDP and that its conformation is changed upon binding of either nucleotide. The apparent Ka (at 25 degrees C) for the IF-2 X GDP and IF-2 X GTP complexes was 8.0 X 10(4) and 7.0 X 10(3) M(-1), respectively. The lower affinity for GTP is associated with a more negative delta S0. The interaction, monitored by 1HNMR spectroscopy, is characterized by fast exchange and results in line broadening and downfield shift of the purine C-8 and ribose C-1' protons of GTP as well as of the beta, gamma-methylene protons of (beta-gamma-methylene)guanosine 5'-triphosphate. The interaction of guanosine nucleotides with IF-2 requires an H bond donor (or acceptor) group at position C-2 of the purine and involves the beta- and/or gamma-phosphate of the nucleotide while the ribose 2'-OH group or the integrity of the furan ring are less critical. IF-2 binds to ribosomal particles with decreasing affinity: 30 S greater than 70 S greater than 50 S. GTP and GDP have no effect on the binding to 70 S. GTP stimulates the binding to the 30 S and depresses somewhat the binding to the 50 S subunits; GDP has the opposite effect. These results seem to rule out that the release of IF 2 from 70 S is due to a GDP-conformation of the factor incompatible with its permanence on the ribosome. The rate and the extent of 30 S initiation complex formation are approximately 2-fold higher with IF-2 X GTP than with IF-2 alone. At low concentrations of IF-2 and 30 S subunits, GDP inhibits this reaction, acting as a strong competitive inhibitor of GTP (Ki = 1.25 X 10(-5)m) and preventing IF-2 from binding to the ribosomal subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1514779020,"The Escherichia coli LIV-I and LS amino acid transport systems are high-affinity, periplasmic, binding protein-dependent systems that utilize the leucine-, isoleucine-, valine-binding protein (LIV-BP) and leucine-specific binding protein (LS-BP), respectively. These two binding proteins (BPs) interact with a common set of membrane proteins to transport branched-chain amino acids into the cytoplasm. The two BP genes are encoded in a regulon at minute 76 of the E. coli chromosome that also contains the genes for the common membrane protein components. We report here the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for the LIV-BP and LS-BP genes and their protein products. Both BPs are encoded with a 23-amino acid signal sequence that is removed when the BPs are secreted into the periplasm. We have examined the pattern of amino acid sequence conservation between the two BP molecules and, by comparison of the predicted secondary structures to the 2.0-A crystal structure of the LIV-BP, have found regions of the BPs that may be involved in membrane protein interaction. We also analyzed the translational efficiency of the two BP mRNAs as determined by their nucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1572336272,"The primary structure of human preprorenin has recently been determined from its cDNA sequence. It includes a 46-amino acid NH2-terminal prosegment. Six peptides corresponding to the entire prosegment (9-40), except for the NH2-terminal (1-8) and COOH-terminal (41-46) ends have been synthesized. These peptides were tested for their inhibitory effect on human plasma renin activity. Boc-Tyr-Thr-Thr-Phe-Lys-Arg-Ile-Phe-Leu-Lys-Arg-Met-Pro-OMe (where Boc represents t-butoxycarbonyl and OMe represents methoxy) (h Y(9-20) and its fragment Boc-Leu-Lys-Arg-Met-Pro-OMe h (16-20) were the most potent inhibitors with IC50 values of 2 X 10(-4) and 3 X 10(-4)M, respectively. Peptides located near the COOH-terminus were less inhibitory. The inhibitory capacity of h (16-20) was studied further on highly purified human renin acting on either pure human angiotensinogen or a synthetic human tetradecapeptide substrate. In both of these assays its inhibitory potency was about 10-fold greater than that found on plasma renin activity. Peptide h (16-20) was 3-6 times less potent in inhibiting human renin than its mouse counterpart m (15-19) was in inhibiting mouse renin. Kinetic studies carried out with h (16-20) showed a mixed type of inhibition. When human angiotensinogen was used as substrate, Ki and K'i values were 17.7 +/- 3.9 and 2.9 +/- 0.9 microM, respectively. These studies showed that human renin, like mouse renin and pepsin, can be inhibited by peptides derived from its prosegment. In addition, as in the case of pepsin, they suggest that the NH2-terminal part of the prosegment interacts more strongly with the active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1600806957,"Isolated liver plasma membranes interact with heme-hemopexin and effect the removal of heme from the complex. This heme is rapidly accumulated by a previously undescribed heme-binding membrane component (HBC). This intrinsic membrane component can be solubilized from the membrane with Triton X-100 in a form that retains the ability to bind heme. Solubilized HBC was shown to be distinct from hemopexin itself, free heme, ligandin, globin, heme oxygenase, cytochrome P-450, and albumin. Since formation of the heme-HBC complex is effected by the interaction of heme-hemopexin with its receptor, HBC may either be a subunit of the heme-hemopexin receptor or a separate protein that interacts with the receptor. HBC can also bind heme (Kd apparent 200 nM) that is presented to it in a nonprotein bound form, showing true heme-binding activity. HBC is proteinaceous since treatment with proteases, heat, and disulfide bond reducing agents diminishes its ability to bind heme. HBC and any associated detergent elutes from Sephacryl S-200 with an apparent molecular weight of 115,000 and Stokes radius of 7.5 nm. This component, which may comprise 0.5% of liver plasma membrane protein, appears to have an acidic pI since it adsorbs to DEAE-cellulose at pH 7.4 but not to CM-cellulose at pH 6.4. In sucrose gradients, HBC migrates with S values of 1.69 and 4.02, suggesting that it has subunits or that it forms multimers under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1547078302,"GMP synthetase (EC 6.3.4.1), a glutamine amido-transferase encoded by the guaA gene, catalyzes the synthesis of GMP from XMP. The guaA gene was subcloned from the Clarke and Carbon (Clarke, L., and Carbon, J. (1976) Cell 9, 91-99) plasmid pLC34-10, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The structural gene encodes a protein of 525 amino acid residues having a calculated Mr of 58,604. The amino acid sequence of the NH2 terminus of GMP synthetase was determined and used to verify the translation start site determined from the DNA sequence. A 68-base pair intercistronic region separates guaA from the upstream guaB gene in the polycistronic guaBA operon. The 3' end of the guaA mRNA was determined by S1 nuclease mapping. The 3' end of guaA mRNA is 36-37 nucleotides downstream of the translation stop codon within a region of dyad symmetry that resembles a rho-independent transcription termination site."

Both modified polynucleotides are equally good substrates for the DNA methyltransferase when they are in the B-form. The substrate properties of the MNU-treated polynucleotides do not differ from those of MNU-treated DNA. One of these modified polynucleotides, MNU-poly(dG-me5dC) X (dG-me5dC), can adopt the Z-conformation under physiological conditions. The conformational transition of the poly(dG-me5dC) X poly(dG-me5dC) from the B-form to the Z-form was monitored by the modification of its spectroscopic properties and by the specific binding of antibodies raised against Z-DNA. The O6-methylguanine residues are repaired in MNU-poly(dG-me5dC) X poly(dG-me5dC) in B-form. At variance, the conversion of this template to the Z-form completely inhibits the repair of the O6-methylguanine residues. The cooperative transition from the Z- to the B-form of MNU-poly(dG-me5dC) X poly(dG-me5dC), mediated by intercalating drugs such as ethidium bromide, restores the ability of MNU-poly(dG-me5dC) X poly(dG-me5dC) to be substrate for the transferase. These results imply that the promutagenic DNA lesion O6-methylguanine persists in Z-DNA fragments and suggest that DNA conformation modulates the extent of DNA repair and, as a result, plays an important role in determining the mutagenic potency of chemical carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W1517601598,"Insulin receptors purified from human placental membranes by gel-filtration and insulin-agarose affinity chromatography were found to be composed of eight different high molecular weight complexes as identified by nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The subunit stoichiometry of these different high molecular weight forms of the insulin receptor were determined by comparisons of silver-stained gel profiles with the autoradiograms of 125I-insulin specifically cross-linked to the alpha subunit and [gamma-32P]ATP specifically autophosphorylated beta subunit gel profiles. Two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of reductant confirmed the subunit stoichiometries as alpha 2 beta 2, alpha 2 beta beta 1, alpha 2 (beta 1)2, alpha 2 beta, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 2, alpha beta, and beta, where alpha is the Mr = 130,000 subunit, beta is the Mr = 95,000 subunit, and beta 1 is the Mr = 45,000 subunit. Treatment of the insulin receptor preparations with oxidized glutathione or N-ethylmaleimide prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis increased the relative amount of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex concomitant with a total disappearance of the alpha 2 beta, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 2, and free beta forms. The effects of oxidized glutathione were found to be completely reversible upon extensive washing of the treated insulin receptors. In contrast, the effects of N-ethylmaleimide were totally irreversible by washing, consistent with known sulfhydryl alkylating properties of this reagent. The formation of these lower molecular weight insulin receptor subunit complexes was further demonstrated to be due to SDS/heat-dependent intramolecular sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange occurring within the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. These studies demonstrate that the largest disulfide-linked complex (alpha 2 beta 2) is the predominant insulin receptor form purified from the human placenta with the other complexes being generated by proteolysis and by internal subunit dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1507615631,"The effects of ATP, vanadate, and molybdate on cathepsin D-catalyzed hydrolysis of proteins and peptides were examined. Hydrolysis of bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, and a synthetic octapeptide was activated by ATP. Degradation of the protein substrates all had similar ATP concentration dependence, but the magnitude of the activation varied. Kinetic constants for ATP activation were obtained with a synthetic substrate. ATP increased kcat from 0.4 to 2 s-1 but did not change KM. Kact for ATP was 800 microM. Studies with pepstatin-Sepharose confirm that ATP does not alter the substrate binding site on cathepsin D. Pepsin, a homologous aspartate protease, was not activated by ATP. It was also found that vanadate and molybdate inhibit cathepsin D-catalyzed proteolysis. However, this inhibition was dramatically dependent on substrate concentration and was eliminated at high substrate. Hydrolysis of the synthetic peptide was not inhibited at concentrations of molybdate below 50 microM, and above this concentration the peptide precipitated. Protein substrates were also found to precipitate in the presence of molybdate. The ATP dependence of the enzyme was not altered by molybdate or vanadate. These results suggest that inhibition by vanadate and molybdate is related to interactions with the substrate rather than with cathepsin D. It is concluded that ATP activation of cathepsin D may play a physiological role in regulation of proteolysis in lysosomes, but that vanadate and molybdate inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis does not establish ATP dependence."
https://openalex.org/W1969901103,"Deletion of more than 400 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of an enzyme causes a severe reduction in catalytic activity. Selected point mutations within the residual protein partially reverse the effects of the missing segment. The selection can yield mutants with activities at least ten times as high as those of the starting polypeptides. One well-characterized mutation, a single amino acid replacement in the residual polypeptide, increases the catalytic activity of the polypeptide by a factor of 5. The results suggest substantial potential for design of protein elements to compensate for missing polypeptide sequences. They also may reflect that progenitors of large aminoacyl-tRNA (transfer RNA) synthetases--one of which was used in these studies--were themselves much smaller."
https://openalex.org/W1998599420,"A set of naturally occurring immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies that are reactive with a defined subset of proteins in the acrosomal cap region of human sperm has been identified. These antibodies are present in a broad spectrum of human sera from males and females, 1 day to 40 years of age, and are absent or markedly deficient in a large proportion of sera from individuals with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or at risk for AIDS. The subset of proteins with which the IgM antibodies are reactive includes a factor (or factors) capable of inhibiting lectin-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation. The prevalence of the sperm-reactive IgM antibodies indicates that they are not elicited by sperm. Further, immunoreactivity of the sperm proteins resulting in depletion of specific circulating IgM antibodies, or other interactions between the sperm proteins and elements of the immune system, may be a factor in the suppressed state of the immune system in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2065218484,"The circumsporozite protein, a surface antigen of the sporozoite stage of the monkey malarial parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using an expression vector containing the 5' regulatory region of the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I gene. It was necessary to eliminate the entire 5' upstream region of the parasite DNA to obtain the expression of this protein. Only the circumsporozoite precursor was produced by the yeast transformants, as detected by immunoblotting. About 55 and 20 percent of the circumsporozoite protein produced in yeast was associated wtih the 25,000 g and 150,000 g particulate fractions, respectively. The protein could be solubilized in Triton X-100 and was stable in solubilized extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1488939816,"Spermatozoa of the California red abalone (Haliotis rufescens; Phylum Mollusca, order Archeogastropoda) possess an acrosomal protein that dissolves the egg vitelline layer during fertilization. Evidence strongly suggests that the dissolution mechanism is a stoichiometric, nonenzymatic process that depends on the hydrophobic nature of the sperm protein which should therefore be termed an egg-lysin. Here we report the complete amino acid sequence of this unique protein. Peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage and trypsin and V8 protease digestions were isolated and subjected to automated Edman degradation. Seven unique CNBr fragments accounted for the intact lysin and the proteolytically derived peptides were used to establish the order of these fragments. The protein is composed of 134 amino acids and contains 36 charged amino acids. The majority of these occur at distances of 2 or 3 residues from each other. A stretch of 41 amino acids contains 10 positively charged amino acids and no negatively charged residue. Model building experiments demonstrated that the charged residues that may occur in alpha-helical regions of the protein would occupy one-half of the circumference of such helices. The other half would display predominantly hydrophobic residues. This arrangement of the charged and hydrophobic residues may account for the biological properties of the lysin."
https://openalex.org/W1578198375,"The deletion of several codons within the signal sequence coding region of the Escherichia coli lipoprotein gene has been accomplished by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. The deletion of the Leu-13 residue in a mutant in which two glycine residues had previously been deleted from the hydrophobic region (Inouye, S., Vlasuk, G., Hsiung, H., and Inouye, M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3729-3733) was found to cause the accumulation of the unmodified form of the protein in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic membrane. This mutation also caused a cessation in cell growth within 15 min after synthesis of the mutant protein was induced. A deletion of the Val-7 residue was capable of suppressing the effect of the Leu-13 deletion when both are present. However, by itself the Val-7 deletion appeared to have little effect on the glycine mutant. The ability of the signal sequence to mediate the secretion of the protein after the deletion of 4 residues from the hydrophobic region demonstrates a surprising degree of flexibility in the length of this region. The deletion mutations were also found to have an unusual effect on the rate of synthesis of lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2115036475,"In the isolated Tyrode's perfused rabbit kidney, metabolism of [9-3H]prostacyclin was examined. In addition to 7,9-dihydroxy-4,13-diketo-dinor-prostanoic acid, dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and pentanorprostaglandin (PG)F1 alpha gamma-lactone, a new, previously unreported, metabolite was isolated and identified by radio-gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 5-hydroxy-6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The structure of this metabolite was further confirmed by comparison of the mass spectra to that of the synthetic standard. The formation of 5-hydroxy-6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the kidney suggested epoxidation of prostacyclin via the renal epoxygenase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1559035238,"Abstract We describe a rapid procedure for obtaining highly purified RNA polymerase II from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The structure of the enzyme was examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis and found to consist of three large polypeptides (molecular weights 200,000, 175,000, and 135,000) and eight smaller polypeptides (molecular weights 29,500, 20,000, 16,000, 15,000, 13,000, 11,500, 10,500, and 9,500). As observed for the analogous enzyme from other organisms, the 175,000 polypeptide (II175) appeared to be a degraded form of the 200,000 polypeptide (II200). The structure of nematode RNA polymerase II closely resembles that of the corresponding enzyme from other animals. Four of its larger subunits shared antigenicity with Drosophila RNA polymerase II. Antibody raised against purified RNA polymerase II reacted with several enzyme subunits in Western blots of purified polymerase and impure enzyme fractions. Immunofluorescence staining was used to visualize RNA polymerase II in the nuclei of a nematode squash preparation and the nucleoplasm of cultured mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539266196,"The ribonuclease resistance assay has been used to probe the effect of trypsin modification of the Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu X GTP on the interaction with E. coli aminoacyl-tRNAs. First, the equilibrium dissociation constant of the trypsin-modified Tu X GTP X Thr-tRNA complex was determined to be 2.3 (0.1) X 10(-5)M at 4 degrees C, pH 7.4. Second, binding of 17 of 20 noninitiator aminoacyl-tRNAs and four sets of purified isoacceptor tRNAs to the modified protein was measured. At 4 degrees C, the complex stabilities vary 500-fold over the range of aminoacyl-tRNAs, with Gln-tRNA forming the strongest ternary complex and Val-tRNA, the weakest. The results are compared to a similar study of ternary complex formation using intact elongation factor Tu X GTP, and the major differences are discussed. An analysis of both data sets, particularly that for the leucine isoacceptor tRNAs, suggests that the trypsin modification of elongation factor Tu X GTP disrupts a region of protein that is involved with the aminoacyl side chain rather than that of the acceptor stem helix region of the aminoacyl-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1669615405,"The secondary structure of 16 S and 23 s rRNA sequences in 30 S preribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli was analyzed by electron microscopy after partial denaturation and compared to mature 16 S and 23 S rRNA examined under the same conditions. The sequences in the pre-rRNA notably lack the specific loops that dominate the 5'-terminal regions of mature 16 S and 23 S rRNA. In other respects, the sizes and locations of loops in the 23 S rRNA sequence are qualitatively very similar in mature and pre-rRNA. Eleven of 12 loops outside of the 5'-terminal domain correspond, with the most frequent features in the 3'-half of the molecule. In contrast, the sizes and locations of loops in the 16 S rRNA sequence differ between precursor and mature forms. In the pre-rRNA, instead of the 370-nucleotide 5'-terminal loop of mature rRNA, some 1000-nucleotide terminal loops are observed. The pre-rRNA also shows a frequent 610-nucleotide central loop and a large 1240-nucleotide loop not seen in the mature rRNA. Also, in the 3'-region of the sequence, the largest loops in pre-rRNA are 120 nucleotides shorter than in mature rRNA. We suggest that the structure of pre-rRNA may promote some alternate conformational features, and that these could be important during ribosome formation or function."
https://openalex.org/W69305743,"Incubation of rat brain cytoplasmic extracts results in the formation of three-dimensional gels that can be collapsed by low-speed centrifugation. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels indicate that these cytoplasmic gels are composed of actin and several associated proteins. Among the latter we have identified a component with an apparent molecular mass of 55,000 daltons. The results of two-dimensional electrophoresis, peptide mapping, and in vivo labeling experiments with [35S]methionine, indicate that the 55-kDa protein is composed of two different gene products we have named alpha and beta; a third polypeptide, named beta', probably derives from the beta polypeptide as a result of some posttranslational modification(s). These three polypeptides, which have the same molecular weight but different isoelectric points, are present in a rather pure preparation of the 55-kDa protein, obtained from cytoplasmic gels by ion-exchange chromatography. In vitro, purified 55-kDa protein interacts in a specific manner with F-actin, as shown by viscosimetry and electron microscopy, leading to the formation of a complex network of cross-linked microfilament bundles. The results of immunofluorescence experiments indicate that the 55-kDa protein is located intracellularly in structures belonging to the Golgi apparatus, and that it is not only present in every type of rat cell tested but also in primary cultures of chick embryo neurons. Based on its intracellular location, we have named the 55-kDa protein as Golgi Protein-55 (GP-55)."
