https://openalex.org/W3120857229,"Some patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome1 (ARDS). Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from that in other types of pneumonia2. Here we investigate SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology by characterizing the immune response in the alveoli of patients infected with the virus. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 88 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 211 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens, and analysed them using flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 10 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within 48 h of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the alveolar space was persistently enriched in T cells and monocytes. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic profiling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages, which in turn respond by producing T cell chemoattractants. These T cells produce interferon-γ to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell activation. Collectively, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages containing SARS-CoV-2 and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives persistent alveolar inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3118724893,"The gut microbiome is shaped by diet and influences host metabolism; however, these links are complex and can be unique to each individual. We performed deep metagenomic sequencing of 1,203 gut microbiomes from 1,098 individuals enrolled in the Personalised Responses to Dietary Composition Trial (PREDICT 1) study, whose detailed long-term diet information, as well as hundreds of fasting and same-meal postprandial cardiometabolic blood marker measurements were available. We found many significant associations between microbes and specific nutrients, foods, food groups and general dietary indices, which were driven especially by the presence and diversity of healthy and plant-based foods. Microbial biomarkers of obesity were reproducible across external publicly available cohorts and in agreement with circulating blood metabolites that are indicators of cardiovascular disease risk. While some microbes, such as Prevotella copri and Blastocystis spp., were indicators of favorable postprandial glucose metabolism, overall microbiome composition was predictive for a large panel of cardiometabolic blood markers including fasting and postprandial glycemic, lipemic and inflammatory indices. The panel of intestinal species associated with healthy dietary habits overlapped with those associated with favorable cardiometabolic and postprandial markers, indicating that our large-scale resource can potentially stratify the gut microbiome into generalizable health levels in individuals without clinically manifest disease."
https://openalex.org/W3118272853,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the selective vulnerability of specific neuronal populations, the molecular signatures of which are largely unknown. To identify and characterize selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex and the superior frontal gyrus-brain regions where neurofibrillary inclusions and neuronal loss occur early and late in AD, respectively-from postmortem brains spanning the progression of AD-type tau neurofibrillary pathology. We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods. We also discovered an astrocyte subpopulation, likely representing reactive astrocytes, characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in homeostatic functions. Our characterization of selectively vulnerable neurons in AD paves the way for future mechanistic studies of selective vulnerability and potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing neuronal resilience."

https://openalex.org/W3118741877,"Breast cancer remains a global challenge, causing over 600,000 deaths in 2018 (ref. 1). To achieve earlier cancer detection, health organizations worldwide recommend screening mammography, which is estimated to decrease breast cancer mortality by 20-40% (refs. 2,3). Despite the clear value of screening mammography, significant false positive and false negative rates along with non-uniformities in expert reader availability leave opportunities for improving quality and access4,5. To address these limitations, there has been much recent interest in applying deep learning to mammography6-18, and these efforts have highlighted two key difficulties: obtaining large amounts of annotated training data and ensuring generalization across populations, acquisition equipment and modalities. Here we present an annotation-efficient deep learning approach that (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance in mammogram classification, (2) successfully extends to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT; '3D mammography'), (3) detects cancers in clinically negative prior mammograms of patients with cancer, (4) generalizes well to a population with low screening rates and (5) outperforms five out of five full-time breast-imaging specialists with an average increase in sensitivity of 14%. By creating new 'maximum suspicion projection' (MSP) images from DBT data, our progressively trained, multiple-instance learning approach effectively trains on DBT exams using only breast-level labels while maintaining localization-based interpretability. Altogether, our results demonstrate promise towards software that can improve the accuracy of and access to screening mammography worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3120417857,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main entry point in airway epithelial cells for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 protein spike triggers viral fusion with the cell plasma membrane, resulting in viral RNA genome delivery into the host. Despite ACE2's critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, full understanding of ACE2 expression, including in response to viral infection, remains unclear. ACE2 was thought to encode five transcripts and one protein of 805 amino acids. In the present study, we identify a novel short isoform of ACE2 expressed in the airway epithelium, the main site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Short ACE2 is substantially upregulated in response to interferon stimulation and rhinovirus infection, but not SARS-CoV-2 infection. This short isoform lacks SARS-CoV-2 spike high-affinity binding sites and, altogether, our data are consistent with a model where short ACE2 is unlikely to directly contribute to host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3120919885,"Most of what we know about adaptive immunity has come from inbred mouse studies, using methods that are often difficult or impossible to confirm in humans. In addition, vaccine responses in mice are often poorly predictive of responses to those same vaccines in humans. Here we use human tonsils, readily available lymphoid organs, to develop a functional organotypic system that recapitulates key germinal center features in vitro, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, plasmablast differentiation and class-switch recombination. We use this system to define the essential cellular components necessary to produce an influenza vaccine response. We also show that it can be used to evaluate humoral immune responses to two priming antigens, rabies vaccine and an adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine, and to assess the effects of different adjuvants. This system should prove useful for studying critical mechanisms underlying adaptive immunity in much greater depth than previously possible and to rapidly test vaccine candidates and adjuvants in an entirely human system. An in vitro human tonsil tissue-based system captures key features of a functional germinal center and can be used to study humoral immune responses to vaccines, new antigens and adjuvants."
https://openalex.org/W3120966537,"We characterize the landscape of somatic mutations—mutations occurring after fertilization—in the human brain using ultra-deep (~250×) whole-genome sequencing of prefrontal cortex from 59 donors with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 15 control donors. We observe a mean of 26 somatic single-nucleotide variants per brain present in ≥4% of cells, with enrichment of mutations in coding and putative regulatory regions. Our analysis reveals that the first cell division after fertilization produces ~3.4 mutations, followed by 2–3 mutations in subsequent generations. This suggests that a typical individual possesses ~80 somatic single-nucleotide variants present in ≥2% of cells—comparable to the number of de novo germline mutations per generation—with about half of individuals having at least one potentially function-altering somatic mutation somewhere in the cortex. ASD brains show an excess of somatic mutations in neural enhancer sequences compared with controls, suggesting that mosaic enhancer mutations may contribute to ASD risk. Rodin and Dou et al. characterized genome-wide somatic mutation in autistic and control brains, revealing that even unaffected individuals may possess dozens of brain somatic mutations and providing insight into the role of somatic mutation in autism."
https://openalex.org/W3120917511,"The clinical impact of rare loss-of-function variants has yet to be determined for most genes. Integration of DNA sequencing data with electronic health records (EHRs) could enhance our understanding of the contribution of rare genetic variation to human disease1. By leveraging 10,900 whole-exome sequences linked to EHR data in the Penn Medicine Biobank, we addressed the association of the cumulative effects of rare predicted loss-of-function variants for each individual gene on human disease on an exome-wide scale, as assessed using a set of diverse EHR phenotypes. After discovering 97 genes with exome-by-phenome-wide significant phenotype associations (P < 10-6), we replicated 26 of these in the Penn Medicine Biobank, as well as in three other medical biobanks and the population-based UK Biobank. Of these 26 genes, five had associations that have been previously reported and represented positive controls, whereas 21 had phenotype associations not previously reported, among which were genes implicated in glaucoma, aortic ectasia, diabetes mellitus, muscular dystrophy and hearing loss. These findings show the value of aggregating rare predicted loss-of-function variants into 'gene burdens' for identifying new gene-disease associations using EHR phenotypes in a medical biobank. We suggest that application of this approach to even larger numbers of individuals will provide the statistical power required to uncover unexplored relationships between rare genetic variation and disease phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3119206362,"Although germline de novo copy number variants (CNVs) are known causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the contribution of mosaic (early-developmental) copy number variants (mCNVs) has not been explored. In this study, we assessed the contribution of mCNVs to ASD by ascertaining mCNVs in genotype array intensity data from 12,077 probands with ASD and 5,500 unaffected siblings. We detected 46 mCNVs in probands and 19 mCNVs in siblings, affecting 2.8-73.8% of cells. Probands carried a significant burden of large (>4-Mb) mCNVs, which were detected in 25 probands but only one sibling (odds ratio = 11.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-84.2, P = 7.4 × 10-4). Event size positively correlated with severity of ASD symptoms (P = 0.016). Surprisingly, we did not observe mosaic analogues of the short de novo CNVs recurrently observed in ASD (eg, 16p11.2). We further experimentally validated two mCNVs in postmortem brain tissue from 59 additional probands. These results indicate that mCNVs contribute a previously unexplained component of ASD risk."
https://openalex.org/W3121005832,"Studying the spatial characteristics of China’s ageing and its influencing factors is of great practical significance because China has the largest elderly population in the world. Using 2000 and 2010 census data, this study explores the degree, pace, and pattern of population ageing and its driving mechanism using exploratory spatial data analysis and the geographically weighed regression model. Between 2000 and 2010, population ageing increased rapidly countrywide; yet, spatial differences between eastern and western China narrowed. The degree of provincial population ageing and its spatiality were determined by natural population growth, migration, and local economic development. Life expectancy and mortality were the primary long-term factors, and GDP per capita was the prime contributor in the early days of economic development; the migration rate was the dominant influence after 2010. China’s overall spatial differentiation of population ageing shifted from a north–south to an east–west division."
https://openalex.org/W3118759818,"RNA methylations of varied RNA species (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, non-coding RNA) generate a range of modified nucleotides, including N6-methyladenosine. Here we study the enzymology of three human RNA methyltransferases that methylate the adenosine amino group in diverse contexts, when it is: the first transcribed nucleotide after the mRNA cap (PCIF1), at position 1832 of 18S rRNA (MettL5-Trm112 complex), and within a hairpin in the 3′ UTR of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetase (MettL16). Among these three enzymes, the catalytic efficiency ranges from PCIF1, with the fastest turnover rate of >230 h−1 μM−1 on mRNA cap analog, down to MettL16, which has the lowest rate of ∼3 h−1 μM−1 acting on an RNA hairpin. Both PCIF1 and MettL5 have a binding affinity (Km) of ∼1 μM or less for both substrates of SAM and RNA, whereas MettL16 has significantly lower binding affinities for both (Km >0.4 mM for SAM and ∼10 μM for RNA). The three enzymes are active over a wide pH range (∼5.4–9.4) and have different preferences for ionic strength. Sodium chloride at 200 mM markedly diminished methylation activity of MettL5-Trm112 complex, whereas MettL16 had higher activity in the range of 200 to 500 mM NaCl. Zinc ion inhibited activities of all three enzymes. Together, these results illustrate the diversity of RNA adenosine methyltransferases in their enzymatic mechanisms and substrate specificities and underline the need for assay optimization in their study.

We note that these three MTases all possess conserved sequence motifs for binding cofactor SAM (motif I) and for catalysis of amino (NH2)-methylation (motif IV) in a particular order in their amino acid sequence (39Malone T.

Many paths to methyltransfer: A chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). Here, we found a surprisingly wide range of optimal conditions for the in vitro enzymatic activity of each enzyme acting on its known RNA substrates. We first optimized the enzymatic activity of purified recombinant full-length human PCIF1 (Fig. S2, A–C), using as substrate the O-methylated cap analog, which has a 2’-O-methyladenosine at the +1 site [m7G(5’)ppp(5’)(2’OmeA)pG]. PCIF1 is active over a wide pH range of ∼5 to 10 (Fig. 1A), but is sensitive to increased ionic strength of sodium chloride beyond 200 mM (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we observed greater activity at both ends of the tested pH range, at either pH 5.4 or pH 9.4 (Fig. 1A), which was independent of the buffering agent used (Fig. 1C). We next measured the PCIF1 kinetic parameters at three different pH values (5.4, 8.0, and 9.4) by varying, respectively, concentrations of the RNA substrate (Fig. 1D) and methyl donor SAM (Fig. 1E). Like the pH activity curve, the kcat values for the RNA and SAM substrates are each ∼2 to 3× higher at pH 5.4 and 9.4 than at pH 8.0 (summarized in Fig. 1F). However, binding affinities for the RNA substrate (as reflected by Km values) are approximately the same (∼0.3 μM) at the two higher pH conditions (8.0 and 9.6) and fourfold lower (i.e., increased binding affinity) than at pH 5.4 (Km value ∼1.2 μM). For comparison, Akichika et al. (23Akichika S. Hirano S. Shichino Y. Suzuki T. Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Sugita A. Hirose Y. Iwasaki S. Nureki O. Suzuki T. Cap-specific terminal N (6)-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II-associated methyltransferase.Science. 2019; 363eaav0080Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) reported Km = 3.5 μM for m7Gppp(2’OmeA). That Km for the cap substrate is about an order of magnitude higher than the one we determined (0.3 μM at pH 8.0 versus 3.5 μM at pH 7.5). Their study was performed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5, so near where we saw lowest activity (Fig. 1A)]. On the other hand, the binding affinities for SAM (again, as reflected by Km) remain relatively constant at ∼0.7 to 0.9 μM over a range of pH values. Taken together, the catalytic efficiency of PCIF1 on the mRNA cap analog (comparing kcat/Km values) is the highest at pH 9.4 (3.9 min−1 μM−1; Fig. 1F), more than 1.5× higher than that at pH 8.0 (2.2 min−1 μM−1) and >2.5× higher than at pH 5.4 (1.5 min−1 μM−1). The higher kcat value at lower pH (5.4) is probably unique to the cap analog, as there are two titratable groups on the ligand (41Dlugosz M. Blachut-Okrasinska E. Bojarska E. Darzynkiewicz E. Antosiewicz J.M. Effects of pH on kinetics of binding of mRNA-cap analogs by translation initiation factor eIF4E.Eur. Biophys. J. 2003; 31: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that might be directly involved in the binding. Direct interactions with the cap have not been characterized structurally with human PCIF1, but the zebrafish ortholog uses both positively and negatively charged residues (Arg269 and Glu563) in its interactions with the ribose and guanine moieties of m7G, as well as Arg239 interaction with one of the phosphate groups in the cap (23Akichika S. Hirano S. Shichino Y. Suzuki T. Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Sugita A. Hirose Y. Iwasaki S. Nureki O. Suzuki T. Cap-specific terminal N (6)-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II-associated methyltransferase.Science. 2019; 363eaav0080Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These charged residues are all conserved in human PCIF1. We did not observe a similar kcat versus pH phenomenon on a short RNA oligonucleotide—its methylation increased monotonically with increasing pH (Fig. 1G). Compared with the mRNA cap analog, we observed greatly reduced activity (by a factor of ∼100) on the conventional RNA oligo (without any pre-modifications) (Fig. 1G). Human PCIF1 has been structurally characterized as two separate fragments (23Akichika S. Hirano S. Shichino Y. Suzuki T. Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Sugita A. Hirose Y. Iwasaki S. Nureki O. Suzuki T. Cap-specific terminal N (6)-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II-associated methyltransferase.Science. 2019; 363eaav0080Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar): an NMR structure of the RNA polymerase-binding WW domain (residues 40–86) and a crystal structure of a large C-terminal fragment (residues 165–668) containing the MTase domain in complex with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) (Fig. 2A). To exclude the possibility of protein aggregation influencing activity at different pH values, we used three biophysical methods to measure the molecular mass of the full-length PCIF1 at pH 7.5 or 8.0, where we observed the lowest kcat value on cap analog (Fig. 1A). The sequence-predicted monomeric MW of PCIF1 (704 residues) is 80.7 kDa. First, the samples were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), which gave the apparent molecular weight of ∼80 kDa (Fig. S2A). Second, SEC coupled with synchrotron-based multiangle light scattering (MALS) (42Some D. Amartely H. Tsadok A. Lebendiker M. Characterization of proteins by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS).J. Vis. Exp. 2019; 148e59615Google Scholar) gave the absolute mass of 86 kDa with an averaged hydrodynamic radius of 4.8 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2, E and F). The same SEC fractions were simultaneously examined by synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (43Kikhney A.G. Svergun D.I. A practical guide to small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of flexible and intrinsically disordered proteins.FEBS Lett. 2015; 589: 2570-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which gave the molecular weight of 86 kDa (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3). In sum, the observed molecular mass from all three methods agrees with the calculated mass of a monomeric form of PCIF1 (Fig. 2B). The overall shape of the SAXS envelope agrees with a negative stain electron microscopy (EM) model, with the maximum dimension of the molecule to be 115 to 120 Å (Fig. 2, C and D and Fig. S4). The overall contour of the low-resolution models can be fitted with the X-ray structure of the C-terminal MTase domain (Fig. 2C). The additional unaccounted-for density near one corner of the SAXS envelope might be where the N-terminal WW domain is located (red circle in Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, we observed extra density in the middle of the SAXS envelope, where the nucleic acid substrate might be bound. We generated a homology model for the full-length PCIF1 using I-TASSER (44Yang J. Yan R. Roy A. Xu D. Poisson J. Zhang Y. The I-TASSER suite: Protein structure and function prediction.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar), including the missing N-terminal residues, the linker region between the WW and MTase domains, and the C-terminal residues. Interestingly, the extreme C-terminal 15-residues form an alpha helix that extends to the central bulged density (Fig. 2D). Helical wheel analysis (Fig. 2E) suggests that this helix has a basic face that incorporates the three arginine residues in the sequence KDRDSGREQGPSREPHPTCOOH, consistent with possible nucleic acid binding. The C-terminal 25 residues, specifically including these three arginines, are highly conserved among the Mammalia (other than monotremes, Fig. 2F). These residues follow a conserved polyserine tract that, in other proteins, can be phosphorylated and affect subnuclear localization (45Wolf A. Mantri M. Heim A. Muller U. Fichter E. Mackeen M.M. Schermelleh L. Dadie G. Leonhardt H. Venien-Bryan C. Kessler B.M. Schofield C.J. Bottger A. The polyserine domain of the lysyl-5 hydroxylase Jmjd6 mediates subnuclear localization.Biochem.

Finally, we used dynamic light scattering to determine the size distribution of PCIF1 at five different pH values (Fig. 2G). We observed protein aggregation only at pH < 5, whereas PCIF1 is stable over the pH range of 5.4 to 11, with a hydrodynamic radius of 4.5 to 5 nm (or diameter of ∼9–10 nm) in agreement with SAXS and the EM model (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, the protein has the least dynamic nonuniformity, as indicated by smallest polydispersity of ∼5%, at pH 8.0. This suggests that the pH-dependent lower kcat value on cap analog is substrate specific. During our study, two publications reported the identification of MettL5, an RNA adenine MTase that methylates A1832 of 18S rRNA (31van Tran N. Ernst F.G.M. Hawley B.R. Zorbas C. Ulryck N. Hackert P.

This 18S rRNA N6mA, first identified about 35 years ago (47Maden B.E. Identification of the locations of the methyl groups in 18 S ribosomal RNA from Xenopus laevis and man.J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 681-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is located in the 3′ minor domain of 18S, at the very base of helix h44, and only a few nucleotides away from the decoding center. Van Tran et al. (31van Tran N. Ernst F.G.M. Hawley B.R. Zorbas C. Ulryck N. Hackert P. Bohnsack K.E. Bohnsack M.T. Jaffrey S.R. Graille M. Lafontaine D.L.J. The human 18S rRNA m6A methyltransferase METTL5 is stabilized by TRMT112.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7719-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showed that MettL5 must form a heterodimeric complex with Trm112 for its stability in cells and determined an X-ray structure of the MettL5-Trm112 complex with bound SAM (PDB 6H2U). Unexpectedly, despite extensive efforts, the authors “were unable to recapitulate METTL5–TRMT112 enzymatic activity in vitro with short single- or double-stranded RNAs corresponding to the sequences surrounding m6A1832 in the mature ribosome” (31van Tran N.

The human 18S rRNA m6A methyltransferase METTL5 is stabilized by TRMT112.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7719-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a GST-MettL5 fusion purified from E. coli (in the absence of Trm112) was active in vitro on total RNA, on RNAs >200 nt long, and on dsRNAs (32Ignatova V.V. Stolz P. Kaiser S. Gustafsson T.H. Lastres P.R. Sanz-Moreno A. Cho Y.L. Amarie O.V. Aguilar-Pimentel A. Klein-Rodewald T. Calzada-Wack J. Becker L. Marschall S. Kraiger M. Garrett L. et al.The rRNA m(6)A methyltransferase METTL5 is involved in pluripotency and developmental programs.Genes Dev. 2020; 34: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, regarding MettL5 activity in vitro, we purified recombinant MettL5-Trm112 complex (Fig. 3A). Because we do not know the conditions under which the unsuccessful experiments were conducted, we designed a short linear 14-mer RNA oligo corresponding to the sequence surrounding A1832 of 18S rRNA and tested for in vitro MettL5-Trim112 activity under minimal buffer conditions (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 1 mM DTT). We observed activity at no or low NaCl concentration (0–50 mM), but the activity was undetectable at 200 mM NaCl (Fig. 3B). Unlike PCIF1, MettL5-Trm112 methylase complex exhibited the highest activity at pH 8.0, followed by pH 9.4 and 5.4 (Fig. 3C). Under the linear reaction conditions of pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl for 20 min (Fig. 3D), the enzyme complex has similar Km values (∼1 μM) for the RNA oligo substrate and for SAM, while showing kcat values of ∼13 h−1"
https://openalex.org/W3119845579,"Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at serine-129 is an important marker of pathologically relevant, aggregated forms of the protein in several important human diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Dementia with Lewy bodies, and Multiple system atrophy. Although several kinases have been shown to be capable of phosphorylating alpha-synuclein in various model systems, the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates alpha-synuclein in the Lewy body remains unknown. One member of the Polo-like kinase family, PLK2, is a strong candidate for being the Lewy body kinase. To examine this possibility, we have used a combination of approaches, including biochemical, immunohistochemical, and <i>in vivo</i> multiphoton imaging techniques to study the consequences of PLK2 genetic deletion on alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in both the presynaptic terminal and preformed fibril-induced Lewy body pathology in mouse cortex. We find that PLK2 deletion reduces presynaptic terminal alpha-synuclein serine-129 phosphorylation, but has no effect on Lewy body phosphorylation levels. Serine-129 mutation to the phosphomimetic alanine or the unphosphorylatable analog aspartate does not change the rate of cell death of Lewy inclusion-bearing neurons in our <i>in vivo</i> multiphoton imaging paradigm, but PLK2 deletion does slow the rate of neuronal death. Our data indicate that inhibition of PLK2 represents a promising avenue for developing new therapeutics, but that the mechanism of neuroprotection by PLK2 inhibition is not likely due to reducing alpha-synuclein serine-129 phosphorylation and that the true Lewy body kinase still awaits discovery."

This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data, mental health measurements, and stress-related questionnaires from workers in 2 hospitals in Yokohama, Japan, from March 23, 2020, to April 6, 2020. The prevalence rates of general psychological distress and event-related distress were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the 26-item stress-related questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes for workers both at high- and low-risk for infection of COVID-19. A questionnaire was distributed to 4133 hospital workers, and 2697 (65.3%) valid questionnaires were used for analyses. Overall, 536 (20.0%) were high-risk workers, 944 (35.0%) of all hospital workers showed general distress, and 189 (7.0%) demonstrated event-related distress. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that ‘Feeling of being isolated and discriminated’ was associated with both the general and event-related distress for both the high- and low-risk workers. In this survey, not only high-risk workers but also low-risk workers in the hospitals admitting COVID-19 patients reported experiencing psychological distress at the beginning of the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3120739106,"Background Even though evidence shows that access to and use of improved latrines is related to healthful families and the public, obstacles to the adoption and use of improved latrine facilities remain. Globally, not many inquiries appear to have been carried out to satisfactorily inform us regarding the multi-level barriers influencing the adoption and utilization of improved latrines facilities. Related studies in Ethiopia are even fewer. Methods Two qualitative data gathering methods, viz., key informant interviews and focus group discussions, were employed to collect data for this study. A total of fifteen focus group discussions were conducted with members of the community in the rural Wonago district of Ethiopia. Similarly, ten key informant interviews were conducted with water, sanitation, and hygiene officers, and health extension workers responsible for coordinating sanitation and hygiene activities. Open code software 4.03 was used for thematic analysis. Result Barriers to adoption and use of improved latrine facilities were categorized into Contextual factors (e.g. Gender, educational status, personal preference for using the field, limited space, population density, the status of land ownership), Psychosocial factors (Culture, beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions of minimal health threat from children's feces), and Technological factors (inconveniences in acquiring materials and cost of constructing a latrine). Conclusion There are a series of multi-leveled barriers to the sustained adoption and use of latrines. Providing funding opportunities for the underprivileged and offering training on the engineering skills of latrine construction at the community level based on the contextual soil circumstances could expand the latrine coverage and use. Similarly, taking into account the variability in motivations for adopting and using latrines among our study in Ethiopia and other studies, we implore public health experts to recognize behaviors and norms in their target communities in advance of implementing sanitation interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3119453354,"Background Twin pregnancies account for 0.5–2.0% of all gestations worldwide. They have a negative impact on perinatal health indicators, mainly owing to the increased risk for preterm birth. However, population-based data from low/middle income countries are limited. The current paper aims to understand the health risks of twins, compared to singletons, amongst late preterms and early terms. Methods Data is from “Birth in Brazil”, a national inquiry into childbirth care conducted in 2011/2012 in 266 maternity hospitals. We included women with a live birth or a stillborn, and excluded births of triplets or more, totalling 23,746 singletons and 554 twins. We used multiple logistic regressions and adjusted for potential confounders. Results Twins accounted for 1.2% of gestations and 2.3% of newborns. They had higher prevalence of low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction, when compared to singletons, in all gestational age groups, except in the very premature ones (&lt;34 weeks). Amongst late preterm’s, twins had higher odds of jaundice (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.8–4.2) and antibiotic use (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.2). Amongst early-terms, twins had higher odds of oxygen therapy (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3–5.9), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5–6.5), transient tachypnoea (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5–9.2), jaundice (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3–5.9) and antibiotic use (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.14.9). In relation to birth order, the second-born infant had an elevated likelihood of jaundice, antibiotic use and oxygen therapy, than the first-born infant. Conclusion Although strongly mediated by gestational age, an independent risk remains for twins for most neonatal morbidities, when compared to singletons. These disadvantages seem to be more prominent in early-term newborns than in the late preterm ones."
https://openalex.org/W3119728799,"Anxiety is often comorbid with pain. Delta opioid receptors (DORs) are promising targets for the treatment of pain and mental disorders with little addictive potential. However, their roles in anxiety symptoms at different stages of pain are unclear. In the current study, mice with inflammatory pain at the fourth hour following complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) injection displayed significant anxiety-like behavior, which disappeared at the seventh day. Combining electrophysiology, optogenetics, and pharmacology, we found that activation of delta opioid receptor 1 (DOR1) in the central nucleus amygdala (CeA) inhibited both the anxiolytic excitatory input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the anxiogenic excitatory input from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN). In contrast, activation of delta opioid receptor 2 (DOR2) did not affect CeA excitatory synaptic transmission in normal and 4-h CFA mice but inhibited the excitatory projection from the PBN rather than the BLA in 7-day CFA mice. Furthermore, the function of both DOR1 and DOR2 was downregulated to the point of not being detectable in the CeA of mice at the 21st day following CFA injection. Taken together, these results suggest that functional switching of DOR1 and DOR2 is associated with anxiety states at different stages of pain via modulating the activity of specific pathways (BLA-CeA and PBN-CeA).

Pain is a complex disorder including an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Pain is closely associated with a number of physiological and psychological maladaptations, including anxiety (1Gerrits M.M. van Oppen P. van Marwijk H.W. Penninx B.W. van der Horst H.E.

However, the mechanism underlying comorbid anxiety during the development of persistent pain is not fully understood. Opioid drugs are most often prescribed for pain control but cause several severe side effects after repeated use, including analgesic tolerance and addiction (4Ballantyne J.C. LaForge K.S.

Opioid receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptors, which have three subtypes: the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and κ-opioid receptor (5Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y.

Even though only one DOR gene has been identified until now, two subtypes of DOR have been pharmacologically identified: DOR1, which is sensitive to DPDPE and antagonized by 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX), and DOR2, which is sensitive to deltorphin II and antagonized by naltriben (NTB) (15Sofuoglu M. Portoghese P.S.

Activation of either DOR1 or DOR2 in the ventromedial medulla increases the pain threshold (16Thorat S.N. Hammond D.L. Modulation of nociception by microinjection of delta-1 and delta-2 opioid receptor ligands in the ventromedial medulla of the rat.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1185-1192PubMed Google Scholar). However, only the DOR2 selective antagonist abolishes the anxiolytic effects of novel DOR agonist KNT-127 (1,2,3,4,4a,5,12,12a-octahydro-2-methyl-4aβ,1β-([1,2]benzenomethano)-2,6-diazanaphthacene-12aβ,17-diol) (17Sugiyama A.

A recent study found that both DOR1 and DOR2 coexist in the same neurons and produce the opposite responses (18Margolis E.B. Fujita W. Devi L.A. Fields H.L. Two delta opioid receptor subtypes are functional in single ventral tegmental area neurons, and can interact with the mu opioid receptor.Neuropharmacology. 2017; 123: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the two DOR subtypes in the central nervous system may have different functions. However, the role of the two DORs in pain-associated anxiety remains unclear. The DORs are widely expressed in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus and hypothalamus, as well as the basal ganglia and amygdala (19Simonin F. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Matthes H. Nappey V. Lannes B. Micheletti G. Kieffer B. The human delta-opioid receptor: Genomic organization, cDNA cloning, functional expression, and distribution in human brain.Mol.

The amygdala has been well recognized in pain and anxiety modulation (21Neugebauer V. Li W. Bird G.C. Han J.S. The amygdala and persistent pain.Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar); in particular, the central amygdala (CeA), referred to as the “nociceptive amygdala” (21Neugebauer V. Li W. Bird G.C. Han J.S. The amygdala and persistent pain.Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), serves as the output of the amygdala. The opioidergic system of the CeA is involved in anxiety-related behaviors (22Zarrindast M.-R. Babapoor-Farrokhran S. Babapoor-Farrokhran S. Rezayof A. Involvement of opioidergic system of the ventral hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens or the central amygdala in anxiety-related behavior.Life Sci. 2008; 82: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the function of different subtypes of DORs in the CeA for pain-associated anxiety is not clear. In this study, we aimed to characterize the role of the two DOR subtypes (DOR1 and DOR2) in the CeA for pain-associated anxiety at different stages of pain in a mouse model that was established by complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). Anxiety-like behaviors in pain have been well documented in animal models (23Narita M. Kaneko C. Miyoshi K. Nagumo Y. Kuzumaki N. Nakajima M. Nanjo K. Matsuzawa K. Yamazaki M. Suzuki T. Chronic pain induces anxiety with concomitant changes in opioidergic function in the amygdala.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2006; 31: 739Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Jin Y. Meng Q.

A somatosensory cortex input to the caudal dorsolateral striatum controls comorbid anxiety in persistent pain.Pain. 2020; 161: 416-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here, anxiety-like behaviors were assessed at different time points of inflammatory pain. Following CFA injection, the mechanical pain threshold was significantly decreased (Fig. 1A). Then, anxiety-like behaviors of the mice treated with CFA for 4 h (CFA 4 h) or 7 days (CFA 7 days) were separately assessed by the elevated plus maze (EPM) test and open field test (OFT). Interestingly, the CFA 4 h mice displayed anxiety-like behaviors, indicated by less time spent in and fewer entries into the open arms of the EPM or central area of the open field compared with the saline 4-h mice (Fig. 1, B–E), but no significant difference was detected between saline 7-day (Sal 7 days) and CFA 7-day mice (Fig. 1, F–I). Moreover, no significant difference in the total traveled distance was detected in CFA 4-h or CFA 7-day mice compared with the control mice (Fig. S1). We next determined how the anxiety-like behaviors induced by acute pain disappeared during the development of persistent pain. Considering that the CeA consists of approximately 95% GABA neurons (25Haubensak W. Kunwar P.S. Cai H. Ciocchi S. Wall N.R. Ponnusamy R. Biag J. Dong H.W. Deisseroth K. Callaway E.M. Fanselow M.S. Luthi A. Anderson D.J. Genetic dissection of an amygdala microcircuit that gates conditioned fear.Nature. 2010; 468: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), we crossed glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (GAD2, a GABA synthetic enzyme)-Cre mice with Ai9 (RCL-tdT) mice (26Madisen L.

The excitatory transmission in the CeA has been shown to be involved in pain and emotional processing (27Ren W. Neugebauer V. Pain-related increase of excitatory transmission and decrease of inhibitory transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala are mediated by mGluR1.Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Tye K.M. Prakash R. Kim S.Y. Fenno L.E. Grosenick L. Zarabi H. Thompson K.R. Gradinaru V. Ramakrishnan C. Deisseroth K. Amygdala circuitry mediating reversible and bidirectional control of anxiety.Nature. 2011; 471: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Through whole-cell recording, we found that both the frequency and the amplitude of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) recorded in the CeA from CFA 4 h mice were significantly increased compared with those from saline mice (Fig. 2C). Similarly, both the frequency and the amplitude of the mEPSC recorded in CFA 7-day mice were increased (Fig. 2D). DORs are evolving targets for the treatment of pain and mental disorders (10Pradhan A.A. Befort K. Nozaki C. Gavériaux-Ruff C. Kieffer B.L. The delta opioid receptor: An evolving target for the treatment of brain disorders.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2011; 32: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and could be recruited onto the cell membrane in a chronic pain state (29Bie B. Pan Z.Z. Trafficking of central opioid receptors and descending pain inhibition.Mol. Pain. 2007; 3: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether the increased excitatory transmission in the CeA was affected by DORs. We found that following perfusion of DPDPE, the frequency of the mEPSC was significantly reduced in normal and CFA 4 h mice without affecting the amplitude (Fig. 2, E–G). However, the increased frequency and amplitude of the mEPSC recorded in CFA 7-day mice were unaffected (Fig. 2, E–G). Following perfusion of deltorphin II, both the frequency and the amplitude of the mEPSC recorded in normal and CFA 4 h mice were unaffected (Fig. 2, H–J), but the increased frequency recorded in CFA 7-day mice was significantly inhibited without affecting the amplitude (Fig. 2, H–J). These data suggested that the inhibitory action of DOR1 on the excitatory transmission was switched on by that of DOR2 during the development of pain. Given that different excitatory inputs to the CeA have different functions (30Han S. Soleiman M.T. Soden M.E. Zweifel L.S. Palmiter R.D.

The paraventricular thalamus controls a central amygdala fear circuit.Nature. 2015; 519: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we determined whether dysfunction of DOR1 or the emergence of DOR2 was involved in affecting a specific pathway. It has been shown that there are increased excitatory inputs from the BLA to the CeA in pain states (27Ren W. Neugebauer V. Pain-related increase of excitatory transmission and decrease of inhibitory transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala are mediated by mGluR1.Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of DOR activation on the excitatory input from the BLA to the CeA, adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry) was injected into the BLA of CaMKII-Cre mice, a mouse line that drives Cre enzyme expression in excitatory neurons, and whole-cell recording was performed on CeA neurons (Fig. 3, A–C). The glutamate-mediated EPSCs, which could be blocked by AMPA receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), were recorded in CeA neurons following optical activation of ChR2-containing terminals (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the recorded light-evoked EPSCs were inhibited by perfusion of DPDPE rather than deltorphin II in normal and CFA 4 h mice (Fig. 3E and Fig. S2A). However, the light-evoked EPSCs were unaffected by perfusion of both DPDPE and deltorphin II in CFA 7-day mice (Fig. 3F). Then, we examined the roles of the BLAGlu-CeA pathway in pain and anxiety. In normal CaMKII-Cre mice, the pain threshold was increased after optical activation of ChR2-containing fibers in the CeA (Fig. S2B). The anxiety-like behaviors and hyperalgesia observed in CFA 4 h mice were alleviated following optical activation of this pathway (Fig. 3G). Similarly, in CFA 7-day mice, the pain threshold, the time spent in the center of the open field, and the time spent in the open arms of the EPM were increased by the optical manipulation as well (Fig. S2E). Furthermore, we injected an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-dependent eNpHR3.0-EYFP (AAV-DIO-eNpHR3.0-EYFP) into the BLA of CaMKII-Cre mice to inhibit the BLA-CeA pathway (Fig. 3H and Fig. S2D). The BLA neurons expressing eNpHR3.0-EYFP were hyperpolarized by 594 nm light (Fig. 3I). After optical inhibition of eNpHR3.0-containing fibers in the CeA, the pain sensitization and anxiety-like behaviors of CFA 4 h mice were deteriorated (Fig. S2F); CFA 7-day mice displayed anxiety-like behaviors (Fig. 3J). In addition to the BLA, the increased excitatory input from the PBN to the CeA in pain states has also been reported (30Han S. Soleiman M.T. Soden M.E. Zweifel L.S. Palmiter R.D. Elucidating an affective pain circuit that creates a threat memory.Cell. 2015; 162: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Cai Y.-Q. Wang W.

Spared nerve injury differentially alters parabrachial monosynaptic excitatory inputs to molecularly specific neurons in distinct subregions of the central amygdala.Pain. 2020; 161: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the excitatory input from the PBN could be modulated by DORs. First, adeno-associated virus expressing DIO-ChR2-mCherry was injected into the PBN of CaMKII-Cre mice, and robust mCherry fibers were observed in the CeA (Fig. 4, A and B). After optical activation of ChR2-containing fibers in the CeA, light-evoked EPSCs were reliably induced in CeA neurons and were blocked by perfusion of DNQX (Fig. 4C). In normal and CFA 4 h mice, we found that the light-evoked EPSCs were inhibited by perfusion of DPDPE rather than deltorphin II (Fig. 4D and Fig. S3A). In contrast, the light-evoked EPSCs recorded in CFA 7-day mice were inhibited by perfusion of deltorphin II rather than DPDPE (Fig. 4E). We then determined whether the PBNGlu-CeA pathway was involved in pain and anxiety-like behaviors. The Cre-dependent eNpHR3.0-EYFP-expressing virus was injected into the PBN of CaMKII-Cre mice, and the optical fiber was implanted toward the CeA to selectively inhibit the PBN-CeA pathway (Fig. 4F). We found that in CFA 4 h mice and CFA 7-day mice, the pain threshold was not affected, but the time spent in the center of the open field or open arms of the EPM was increased following optical inhibition of the PBN-CeA pathway (Fig. 4G and Fig. S3B). In addition, following optical activation of ChR2-containing PBNGlu fibers in the CeA, the anxiety-like behaviors of CFA 4 h mice were increased, and CFA 7-day mice displayed anxiety-like behaviors (Fig. 4, H and I and Fig. S3C). These data suggest that the anxiogenic PBNGlu-CeA pathway is likely inhibited by DOR2 activation in CFA 7-day mice. To determine the role of the dysfunction of DOR1 and the emergence of DOR2 in the CeA, DPDPE and deltorphin II were separately microinjected into the CeA (Fig. 5A). Following CeA infusion of DPDPE, the pain threshold of normal mice was significantly decreased, which could be partially reversed by preinfusion of the antagonist BNTX (Fig. 5B). This difference was not observed in either CFA 4 h mice or CFA 7-day mice (Fig. S4A). In addition, the performance of normal, CFA 4 h, and CFA 7-day mice in the EPM test and OFT was not significantly affected following CeA infusion of DPDPE (Fig. 5, D–I). In contrast, CeA infusion of deltorphin II had no effects on the pain threshold of normal, CFA 4-h, or CFA 7-day mice (Fig. 5C and Fig. S4B), while the time spent in the center of the open field or open arms of the EPM was increased for CFA 7-day mice but not for normal or CFA 4 h mice (Fig. 5, D–I). Of note, CeA infusion of naltriben rather than BNTX in CFA 7-day mice induced anxiety-like behaviors (Fig. 5, J and K). These data suggest that the emergence of DOR2 in the CeA is likely involved in the disappearance of anxiety-like behavior in CFA 7-day mice. Anxiety-associated behaviors have frequently been observed in clinical patients and animals with chronic pain (23Narita M. Kaneko C. Miyoshi K. Nagumo Y. Kuzumaki N. Nakajima M. Nanjo K. Matsuzawa K.

In addition, CeA infusion of DPDPE or deltorphin II had no effects on the pain sensitization or anxiety-like behaviors of CFA 21-day mice (Fig. 6, F–H). Overall, these results indicate that the switching and dysfunction of DOR1 and DOR2 subtypes are associated with anxiety states at different stages of inflammatory pain (Fig. 7).Figure 7A model for the switching of DOR1 and DOR2 during the development of persistent pain. In normal mice, DOR1 was expressed on the excitatory presynaptic terminals from the BLA and the PBN. During the development of pain (inflammatory pain, 7 days), DOR1 disappeared from the excitatory presynaptic terminals from both the BLA and the PBN, and DOR2 emerged specifically on the excitatory presynaptic terminals from the PBN. Both of these changes likely contributed to the alleviation of anxiety-like behaviors induced by acute pain. In 21-day inflammatory pain mice with anxiety-like behaviors, both DORs had disappeared from the excitatory presynapse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pain and anxiety are frequently encountered together in the clinic (23Narita M.

Mood and anxiety disorders associated with chronic pain: An examination in a nationally representative sample.Pain. 2003; 106: 127-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Here, we found that anxiety-like behaviors were reliably induced by acute pain (CFA 4 h) and disappeared during the development of persistent pain (CFA 7-day). At CFA 21 days, anxiety-like behaviors reoccurred. Further empirical research shows that the switching of different subtypes of DORs (DOR1 and DOR2) in the CeA is associated with anxiety states at different stages of pain. Central to these processes is that activation of DOR1, but not DOR2, may contribute to CFA 4 h-induced anxiety-like behaviors. In contrast, the membrane trafficking of DOR2 and dysfunction of DOR1 at CFA 7 days cause the disappearance of anxiety-like behaviors at this time. It has been shown that pain stimuli can induce the membrane trafficking of DORs, activation of which by endogenous opioid systems in turn relieves the pain (29Bie B. Pan Z.Z. Trafficking of central opioid receptors and descending pain inhibition.Mol. Pain. 2007; 3: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the function of DOR1 and DOR2 in pain-associated anxiety-like behaviors using pharmacological experiments with electrophysiological and behavioral approaches. Owing to the limitation of the selective antibodies for immunostaining of different subtypes of DORs, classical definition of DOR subtypes is based on pharmacological effects by selective DOR agonists, such as DPDPE and deltorphin II (37Yekkirala A.S. Kalyuzhny A.E. Portoghese P.S. Standard opioid agonists activate heteromeric opioid receptors: Evidence for morphine and [d-Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Glyol(5)]enkephalin as selective mu-delta agonists.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2010; 1: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies suggest that at least two DOR subtypes are expressed in the central nervous system, which are relevant to anxiety and pain (17Sugiyama A. Nagase H. Oka J. Yamada M. Saitoh A. DOR(2)-selective but not DOR(1)-selective antagonist abolishes anxiolytic-like effects of the delta opioid receptor agonist KNT-127.Neuropharmacology. 2014; 79: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but only one DOR gene has been cloned (19Simonin F. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Matthes H. Nappey V. Lannes B. Micheletti G. Kieffer B. The human delta-opioid receptor: Genomic organization, cDNA cloning, functional expression, and distribution in human brain.Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1015-1021PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the inability of certain DOR antagonists to block the effect of DOR agonists, DOR1 is classified as the receptors activated by DPDPE and sensitive to BNTX, while DOR2 is activated by deltorphin II and sensitive to naltriben (38Jiang Q. Takemori A.E. Sultana M. Portoghese P.S. Bowen W.D. Mosberg H.I. Porreca F.

Ther. 1991; 257: 1069-1075PubMed Google Scholar). Because DPDPE is rapidly degraded by peptidases, whereas deltorphin II has a much longer-lasting effect, as it is resistant to these peptidases, they also display different effects on behavioral phenotypes in experimental research (39Suzuki T. Mori T. Tsuji M. Maeda J. Kishimoto Y. Misawa M. Nagase H. Differential effects of mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists on the discriminative stimulus properties of cocaine in rats.Eur. J.

For example, in a 55 °C warm water tail-flick test, a single injection of DPDPE produced antinociception within 30 min, while deltorphin II effects could last for about 1 h with same dose (41Bilsky E.J.

https://openalex.org/W3120126170,"Although several studies showed adverse neurotoxic effects of melamine on hippocampus (HPC)-dependent learning and reversal learning, the evidence for this mechanism is still unknown. We recently demonstrated that intra-hippocampal melamine injection affected the induction of long-term depression, which is associated with novelty acquisition and memory consolidation. Here, we infused melamine into the HPC of rats, and employed behavioral tests, immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological methods to sought evidence for its effects on cognitive flexibility. Rats with intra-hippocampal infusion of melamine displayed dose-dependent increase in trials to the criterion in reversal learning, with no locomotion or motivation defect. Compared with controls, melamine-treated rats avoided HPC-dependent place strategy. Meanwhile, the learning-induced BDNF level in the HPC neurons was significantly reduced. Importantly, bilateral intra-hippocampal BDNF infusion could effectively mitigate the suppressive effects of melamine on neural correlate with reversal performance, and rescue the strategy bias and reversal learning deficits. Our findings provide first evidence for the effect of melamine on cognitive flexibility and suggest that the reversal learning deficit is due to the inability to use place strategy. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of melamine on BDNF-mediated neural activity could be the mechanism, thus advancing the understanding of compulsive behavior in melamine-induced and other neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3120874250,"Urologic complications can still occur following kidney transplantation, sometimes requiring multiple radiological and/or surgical procedures to fully correct the problem. Previously proposed extravesical ureteral reimplantation techniques still carry non-negligible risks of the patient developing urologic complications. About 10 years ago, a new set of modifications to the Lich-Gregoir technique was developed at our center, with the goal of further minimizing the occurrence of urologic complications, and without the need for initial ureteral stent placement. It was believed that an improvement in the surgical technique to minimize the risk of developing urologic complications was possible without the need for stent placement at the time of transplant. In this report, we describe the advantages of this technique (i.e., mobilized bladder, longer spatulation of the ureter, inclusion of bladder mucosa with detrusor muscle layer in the ureteral anastomosis, and use of a right angle clamp in the ureteral orifice to ensure that it does not become stenosed). We also retrospectively report our experience in using this technique among 500 consecutive (prospectively followed) kidney transplant recipients transplanted at our center since 2014. During the first 12mo post-transplant, only 1.4%(7/500) of patients developed a urologic complication; additionally, only 1.0%(5/500) required surgical repair of their original ureteroneocystostomy. Five patients(1.0%) developed a urinary leak, with 3/5 having distal ureteral necrosis, and 1/5 subsequently developing a ureteral stricture. Two other patients developed ureteral stenosis, one due to stricture and one due to ureteral stones. These overall results are excellent when compared with other reports in the literature, especially those in which routine stenting was performed. In summary, we believe that the advantages in using this modified extravesical ureteroneocystostomy technique clearly help in lowering the early post-transplant risk of developing urologic complications. Importantly, these results were achieved without the need for ureteral stent placement at the time of transplant."
https://openalex.org/W3118357301,"Elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW), traditionally an indicator of anemia, has now been recognized as a risk marker for cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. Experimental and acute exposure studies suggest that cadmium and lead individually affect red blood cell production; however, associations between environmental exposures and RDW have not been explored. We evaluated relationships of environmental cadmium and lead exposures to RDW. We used data from 24,607 participants aged ≥20 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003–2016) with information on blood concentrations of cadmium and lead, RDW and socio-demographic factors. In models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, poverty income ratio, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking status and serum cotinine, RDW was increasingly elevated across progressively higher quartiles of blood cadmium concentration. A doubling of cadmium concentration was associated with 0.16 higher RDW (95% CI: 0.14, 0.18) and a doubling of lead concentration with 0.04 higher RDW (95% CI: 0.01, 0.06). Also, higher cadmium and lead concentrations were associated with increased odds of high RDW (RDW&gt;14.8%). The associations were more pronounced in women and those with low-to-normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and held even after controlling for iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiencies. In analysis including both metals, cadmium remained associated with RDW, whereas the corresponding association for lead was substantially attenuated. In this general population sample, blood cadmium and lead exposures were positively associated with RDW. The associations may indicate hemolytic or erythropoietic mechanisms by which exposure increases mortality risk."

This contrast in habitat complexity suggests that studying C . elegans in enriched laboratory conditions can deepen our understanding of its fundamental traits and behaviors. Here, we developed a protocol to create three-dimensional habitable scaffolds for trans-generational culture of C . elegans in the laboratory. Using decellularization and sterilization of fruit tissue, we created an axenic environment that can be navigated throughout and where the microbial environment can be strictly controlled. C . elegans were maintained over generations on this habitat, and showed a clear behavioral bias for the enriched environment. As an initial assessment of behavioral variations, we found that dauer populations in scaffolds exhibit high-frequency, complex nictation behavior including group towering and jumping behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3120718444,"Background Apoptotic pathways in platelets are important for their survival and function. Platelet apoptosis may be involved in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune-mediated disease. In contrast to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, not much is known about the extrinsic pathway mechanisms in platelets. Objectives To investigate the expression of proteins involved in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, including the death receptors, adaptor and regulator proteins in human platelets. To determine a possible trigger of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in platelets. Methods To investigate the expression of key markers of the extrinsic pathway we used targeted immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays. To study their expression and interaction we performed Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation. Treated platelets with different apoptosis triggers were subjected to flow cytometry. Results We could identify the protein expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins TRADD (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor type 1- Associated DEATH Domain protein), TRAF2/5, (TNF Associated Factor) and DEDAF (Death Effector Domain- Associated Factor), FADD (Fas-Associated protein with death domain) as well as the anti-apoptotic proteins DJ-1 (Deglycase 1) and c-FLIP in human platelets. ABT-737 treatment induced a disruption in the co-localization of DJ-1 with FADD. Platelets treated with ABT-737 showed an activation in caspase-3 and -8. The exposure to TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor), FasL (Fas ligand), and TWEAK or to plasma derived from ITP patients, did not lead to changes in caspase-3 and -8 activation in platelets. Conclusions Human platelets express some proteins of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway which can be modulated only by ABT-737 treatment. However so far, no other apoptosis trigger or interaction with an external receptor have been yet identified."
https://openalex.org/W3118291033,"Reaching with a visuomotor distortion in a virtual environment leads to reach adaptation in the trained hand, and in the untrained hand. In the current study we asked if reach adaptation in the untrained (right) hand is due to transfer of explicit adaptation (EA; strategic changes in reaches) and/or implicit adaptation (IA; unconscious changes in reaches) from the trained (left) hand, and if this transfer changes depending on instructions provided. We further asked if EA and IA are retained in both the trained and untrained hands. Participants (n = 60) were divided into 3 groups (Instructed (provided with instructions on how to counteract the visuomotor distortion), Non-Instructed (no instructions provided), and Control (EA not assessed)). EA and IA were assessed in both the trained and untrained hands immediately following rotated reach training with a 40° visuomotor distortion, and again 24 hours later by having participants reach in the absence of cursor feedback. Participants were to reach (1) so that the cursor landed on the target (EA + IA), and (2) so that their hand landed on the target (IA). Results revealed that, while initial EA observed in the trained hand was greater for the Instructed versus Non-Instructed group, the full extent of EA transferred between hands for both groups and was retained across days. IA observed in the trained hand was greatest in the Non-Instructed group. However, IA did not significantly transfer between hands for any of the three groups. Limited retention of IA was observed in the trained hand. Together, these results suggest that while initial EA and IA in the trained hand are dependent on instructions provided, transfer and retention of visuomotor adaptation to a large visuomotor distortion are driven almost exclusively by EA."
https://openalex.org/W3119016500,"The G protein–coupled receptor GPRC6A regulates various physiological processes in response to its interaction with multiple ligands, such as extracellular basic amino acids, divalent cations, testosterone, and the uncarboxylated form of osteocalcin (GluOC). Global ablation of GPRC6A increases the susceptibility of mice to diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders. However, given that GPRC6A is expressed in many tissues and responds to a variety of hormonal and nutritional signals, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of metabolic disorders in conventional knockout mice have remained unclear. On the basis of our previous observation that long-term oral administration of GluOC markedly reduced adipocyte size and improved glucose tolerance in WT mice, we examined whether GPRC6A signaling in adipose tissue might be responsible for prevention of metabolic disorders. We thus generated adipocyte-specific GPRC6A knockout mice, and we found that these animals manifested increased adipose tissue weight, adipocyte hypertrophy, and adipose tissue inflammation when fed a high-fat and high-sucrose diet compared with control mice. These effects were associated with reduced lipolytic activity because of downregulation of lipolytic enzymes such as adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue of the conditional knockout mice. Given that, among GPR6CA ligands tested, GluOC and ornithine increased the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a manner dependent on GPRC6A, our results suggest that the constitutive activation of GPRC6A signaling in adipocytes by GluOC or ornithine plays a key role in adipose lipid handling and the prevention of obesity and related metabolic disorders.

Obesity is characterized by excessive triglyceride storage in adipocytes and nonadipose tissues, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart (1Snel M. Jonker J.T. Schoones J. Lamb H. De Roos A. Pijl H. Smit J.W.A. Meinders A.E. Jazet I.M. Ectopic fat and insulin resistance: Pathophysiology and effect of diet and lifestyle interventions.Int. J. Endocrinol. 2012; 2012: 983814Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is a risk factor for the development of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer, and therefore has a substantial impact on both the quality of life of affected individuals and national health care costs (2Allison D.B. Downey M. Atkinson R.L. Billington C.J. Bray G.A. Eckel R.H. Fikelstein E.A. Michael D. Jensen A.T. Obesity as a disease: A white paper on evidence and arguments commissioned by the council of the Obesity Society.Obesity. 2012; 16: 1161-1177Google Scholar). The major underlying cause of obesity is an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. A shift in the equilibrium away from triglyceride breakdown and toward triglyceride synthesis thus leads to the development and progression of obesity. The G protein–coupled receptor GPRC6A has been implicated as a master regulator of metabolic processes (3Pi M. Nishimoto S.K. Quarles L.D. GPRC6A: Jack of all metabolism (or master of none).Mol. Metab. 2017; 6: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is expressed in many tissues (4Wellendorph P. Bräuner-Osborne H.

Global deletion of Gprc6a in mice induces metabolic disorders, such as hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, osteopenia, and feminization of males (9Pi M. Chen L.

GPRC6A null mice exhibit osteopenia, feminization and metabolic syndrome.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Another line of GPRC6A-deficient mice manifested an increased susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders (10Clemmensen C. Smajilovic S. Madsen A.N. Klein A.B. Holst B. Bräuner-Osborne H. Increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity in GPRC6A receptor knockout mice.J. Endocrinol. 2013; 217: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice lacking GPR6CA specifically in pancreatic β-cells were found to be glucose intolerant as a result of the impairment of β-cell proliferation and insulin production (11Wei J. Hanna T. Suda N. Karsenty G. Ducy P. Osteocalcin promotes β-cell proliferation during development and adulthood through Gprc6a.Diabetes. 2014; 63: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a study on liver-specific GPRC6A knockout mice revealed that GPRC6A signaling in the liver regulates glucose and fat metabolism directly and indirectly by regulating fibroblast growth factor-21 production (12Pi M. Xu F. Ye R. Nishimoto S.K. Williams R.W. Lu L. Quarles L.D. Role of GPRC6A in regulating hepatic energy metabolism in mice.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These observations have suggested that GPRC6A is a key regulator of energy homeostasis, given that it is expressed in many tissues and responds to a variety of hormonal and nutritional signals; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic disorders that are characteristic of conventional knockout mice remain unclear. We have previously shown that long-term oral administration of the GPRC6A ligand GluOC resulted in a marked reduction in adipocyte size and improved glucose tolerance in WT female mice (13Otani T. Mizokami A. Hayashi Y. Gao J. Mori Y. Nakamura S. Takeuchi H. Hirata M. Signaling pathway for adiponectin expression in adipocytes by osteocalcin.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Yasutake Y. Mizokami A. Kawakubo-Yasukochi T. Chishaki S. Takahashi I. Takeuchi H. Hirata M. Long-term oral administration of osteocalcin induces insulin resistance in male mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2016; 310: E662-E675Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We also found that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GluOC resulted in the GPRC6A-dependent activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase, expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ, and production of adiponectin (13Otani T. Mizokami A. Hayashi Y. Gao J. Mori Y. Nakamura S. Takeuchi H. Hirata M. Signaling pathway for adiponectin expression in adipocytes by osteocalcin.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which play a key role in adipocyte differentiation and glucose metabolism. GluOC stimulation also induced expression of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and that of its target gene for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), resulting in the upregulation of lipolysis (15Otani T. Matsuda M. Mizokami A. Kitagawa N. Takeuchi H. Jimi E. Inai T. Hirata M. Osteocalcin triggers Fas/FasL-mediated necroptosis in adipocytes via activation of p300.Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9: 1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations thus suggested that adipose tissue might be the main site of action for GPRC6A in the prevention of metabolic disturbances. We have therefore now generated adipocyte-specific GPRC6A knockout (adG6AKO) mice in order to explore the tissue-specific mechanism by which GPRC6A regulates global energy homeostasis. We found that adipose tissue weight, adipocyte size, and the extent of adipose tissue inflammation were all more pronounced in adG6AKO mice that were fed a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet than in control mice. The increased adiposity of adG6AKO mice was attributable to reduced lipolytic activity associated with the downregulation of lipolytic enzymes, including ATGL and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Our results thus suggest that constitutive GPRC6A signaling in adipocytes induced by physiologically relevant hormones and nutrition-related factors contributes to the prevention of obesity and related metabolic disorders. adG6AKO mice were generated by crossing mice homozygous for a floxed allele of Gprc6a (Gprc6afl/fl mice) with Fabp4–Cre mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the adipose tissue–specific promoter of Fabp4 (Fig. S1). Ablation of GPRC6A, specifically in adipose tissue, was evaluated by immunoblot and RT-PCR analyses. GPRC6A was virtually undetectable at both the protein and mRNA levels in adipocytes isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of adG6AKO mice (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the amount of GPRC6A protein in the testis, in which GPRC6A is highly expressed (8Oury F. Sumara G. Sumara O. Ferron M. Chang H. Smith C.E.E. Hermo L. Suarez S. Roth B.L.L. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Endocrine regulation of male fertility by the skeleton.Cell. 2011; 144: 796-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), did not differ between adG6AKO and control (Gprc6afl/fl) mice (Fig. 1B). This result was indicative of successful adipocyte-targeted Gprc6a depletion. Very little contamination of macrophages, capillaries, and others in eWAT appeared to provide some positive signals, particularly in protein blots. Body weight did not differ significantly between control and adG6AKO mice of both sexes maintained on a normal diet (Fig. S2, A and B), which is consistent with previous results for whole-body GPRC6A knockout mice (16Wellendorph P. Johansen L.D. Jensen A.A. Casanova E. Gassmann M. Deprez P. Clément-Lacroix P. Bettler B. Bräuner-Osborne H. No evidence for a bone phenotype in GPRC6A knockout mice under normal physiological conditions.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 42: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of feeding the mice with an HFS diet, beginning immediately after the lactation period (3 weeks of age). We found that body weight gain was similar between the genotypes in female mice in the HFS diet setting (Fig. 1C). We then tested the effects of long-term GluOC treatment in these mice. Four weeks of GluOC treatment slightly reduced body weight gain only in the control mice (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, consistent with our previous studies (13Otani T. Mizokami A. Hayashi Y. Gao J. Mori Y. Nakamura S. Takeuchi H. Hirata M. Signaling pathway for adiponectin expression in adipocytes by osteocalcin.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Yasutake Y.

Metab. 2016; 310: E662-E675Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the size of the adipocytes was significantly reduced in control mice, but not in adG6AKO mice, after 4 weeks of treatment with GluOC (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, the same experiments using male mice revealed that after 15 weeks of HFS feeding, adG6AKO mice were larger with more fat accumulation in the epididymal adipose tissue than that in control mice (Fig. 2A). Body weight did not differ between the two genotypes until 13 weeks of age, when that of adG6AKO mice became significantly greater than that of the control mice; this result was observed despite the fact that the anal–nasal body length was similar in both groups of animals (Fig. 2, B and C). Food intake did not differ between the two genotypes either before (12 weeks of age) or after (15 weeks of age) adG6AKO mice started to gain more weight than control mice (Fig. 2D). After maintenance on the HFS diet for 12 weeks, the weights of epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue, as well as of the liver, kidney, and small intestine, were significantly greater in adG6AKO mice than in control mice (Fig. 2E). Histological analysis revealed that adipocytes in eWAT of adG6AKO mice were significantly larger than those in control mice after maintenance on the HFS diet for 15 weeks (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this finding, the serum concentration of leptin was significantly increased (Fig. 3B), whereas that of adiponectin was unchanged (Fig. 3C) in adG6AKO mice. The size of adipocytes in adG6AKO mice fed a normal diet was also significantly greater than that in control mice at 25 weeks of age (Fig. S2C). Histological analysis of the liver showed that ectopic fat accumulation, which is often associated with obesity, and liver triglyceride content were greater in adG6AKO mice that were fed the HFS diet for 15 weeks than in control mice (Fig. 3, D and E). The morphology and size of pancreatic islets as well as the serum concentrations of insulin under both basal and glucose-stimulated conditions were similar in mice of the two genotypes that were fed the HFS diet for 15 weeks (Fig. 3, F and G). However, blood glucose levels after food deprivation for 5 or 16 h were significantly higher in the adG6AKO mice (Fig. 3H), suggesting global resistance to insulin in the mutant animals. A similar increase in the fasting blood glucose concentration was apparent in the adG6AKO mice that were fed a normal diet (Fig. S2D). Increased adiposity and ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver can trigger insulin resistance and consequent impairment of systemic glucose handling (17Shoelson S.E. Lee J. Goldfine A.B. Inflammation and insulin resistance.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, an insulin tolerance test revealed that adG6AKO mice that were fed the HFS diet for 13 weeks were resistant to the glucose-lowering effect of insulin compared with their control counterparts (Fig. 4A). An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) also showed that the increase in blood glucose levels induced by glucose injection was significantly higher, and subsequent glucose clearance appeared slower in the mutant mice compared with the control mice (Fig. 4B). Low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue is characterized by macrophage infiltration and the formation of crownlike structures and is a crucial risk factor for insulin resistance. This inflammation was increased in eWAT of adG6AKO mice, as assessed by staining for the macrophage marker F4/80 (18Bastard J.-P. Maachi M. Lagathu C. Kim M.J. Caron M. Vidal H. Capeau J. Feve B. Recent advances in the relationship between obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance.Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2006; 17: 4-12PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). Consistent with this inflammatory phenotype, the abundance of mRNAs for the proinflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor α and F4/80 was increased in eWAT of mutant mice (Fig. 4D). Expansion of adipocytes can result from either increased lipogenesis or suppression of lipolysis. We recently showed that stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the GPRC6A ligand GluOC increased the expression of both ATGL and its upstream transcription factor FoxO1 (15Otani T. Matsuda M. Mizokami A. Kitagawa N. Takeuchi H. Jimi E. Inai T. Hirata M. Osteocalcin triggers Fas/FasL-mediated necroptosis in adipocytes via activation of p300.Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9: 1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To examine whether GPRC6A activation has similar effects in the adipocytes of mice, we isolated eWAT of adG6AKO and control mice that were fed the HFS diet. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the abundance of lipolysis-related proteins, including ATGL, HSL, perilipin, and FoxO1, was markedly downregulated in eWAT of adG6AKO mice compared with that of control mice (Fig. 5A). The extent of HSL phosphorylation at Ser563, which promotes lipolysis, was unchanged in adipocytes of the mutant mice; meanwhile, that of perilipin at Ser497, which triggers lipolysis by leading to the activation of ATGL, was increased (Fig. 5A). The abundance of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a FoxO1-dependent transcription factor that regulates the expression of both ATGL and HSL (19Eguchi J. Wang X. Yu S. Kershaw E.E. Chiu P.C. Dushay J. Estall J.L. Klein U. Maratos-Flier E. Rosen E.D. Transcriptional control of adipose lipid handling by IRF4.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), also tended to be reduced in adipocytes of adG6AKO mice, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 5A). Immunoblot analysis also showed that the amounts of ATGL and HSL in eWAT were significantly reduced or tended to be reduced, respectively, in 25-week-old adG6AKO mice that were fed a normal diet compared with control mice (Fig. S2E). Consistent with this latter finding, the serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) level after food deprivation for 4 h was significantly lower in the mutant mice (Fig. S2F). We also examined the expression of lipolysis- and adipogenesis-related molecules at the mRNA level in the eWAT of adG6AKO and control mice that were fed the HFS diet (Fig. 5B). The expression of lipolysis-related genes, including Pnpla2 (encoding ATGL), Lipe (encoding HSL), and Plin2 (encoding perilipin), was significantly downregulated in eWAT of adG6AKO mice. On the other hand, expression of the adipogenic genes, Pparg, Klf15, and Srebp1c, did not differ between the two genotypes, suggesting that adipogenesis is not affected by Gprc6a deletion. Expression of Cd36 and Slc27a2, both of which encode proteins that contribute to fatty acid uptake as well as that of the lipogenic gene Fas (encoding fatty acid synthase), was also significantly reduced in GPRC6A-deficient adipose tissue. These findings indicate that GPRC6A ablation in adipocytes results in the impairment of lipolysis and consequent adipocyte hypertrophy. To examine whether the suppression of lipolytic molecules in GPRC6A-deficient adipose tissue is actually reflected in the impairment of lipolysis in living mice, we examined control and adG6AKO mice in response to three situations that require lipolysis. First, we subjected the mice to prolonged fasting for 24 h and measured their weight loss. adG6AKO mice lost significantly less weight than control mice in this setting (Fig. 6A). Second, cold-induced thermogenesis was examined. Body temperatures at 25 °C were similar between control and adG6AKO mice (37.6 ± 0.09 and 37.7 ± 0.13, respectively; n = 10). However, at 4 °C, adG6AKO mice experienced a more severe decline in body temperature compared with their counterparts (Fig. 6B). Finally, we evaluated the catecholamine-stimulated release of NEFAs into the circulation. The isoproterenol-induced increase in the serum NEFA concentration was significantly attenuated in adG6AKO mice compared with that in control mice (Fig. 6C). The expression levels of β3-adrenergic receptor in the membrane fractions of WAT from control and mutant mice were similar, indicating no difference in β3-adrenergic receptor signaling (Fig. S3). These results suggest that the mutant mice showed lower metabolism, probably by using lipids. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) calculated from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during the resting day cycle was significantly increased in adG6AKO mice, suggesting impaired fat utilization because of the reduction of lipolysis (Figs. 6, D and E and S4, A and B). Little difference of RER between daytime and nighttime in control mice might be due to high fat feeding. The change in energy partitioning was also supported by an increase in hepatic gluconeogenesis, as assessed by the pyruvate tolerance test (PTT; Fig. S4C). Cumulative energy expenditure and locomotor activity, assessed by measuring the total distances traveled over 24 h, were not altered between the two genotypes (Fig. 6, F and G). Uncoupling protein-1 expression levels in brown adipose tissue were not altered by GPRC6A ablation (Fig. 6H). To examine the mechanism by which GPRC6A signaling regulates lipolysis, we determined the effects of various GPRC6A ligands on the expression of lipolytic molecules in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GPRC6A has been shown to be activated by multiple ligands, including arginine, ornithine, testosterone, and divalent cations, in addition to GluOC (20Clemmensen C. Smajilovic S. Wellendorph P. Bräuner-Osborne H. The GPCR, class C, group 6, subtype A (GPRC6A) receptor: From cloning to physiological function.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Among the ligands tested (ornithine at 1 and 10 mM, GluOC at 2.5 and 10 ng/ml, arginine at 1 mM, testosterone at 10 nM, and Ca2+ at 1 mM), only ornithine and GluOC increased the abundance of ATGL (Figs. 7A and S5). Ornithine was also effective at lower concentrations (Fig. 7B). The effects of ornithine and GluOC on the expression of ATGL were abolished by siRNA-mediated depletion of GPRC6A (Fig. 7C). Accordingly, NEFA release into the culture medium was reduced by GPRC6A knockdown (Fig. 7D). The expression of enzymes responsible for both fatty acid β-oxidation and PPRAα, which regulates the transcription of these enzymes, was not affected by ornithine (Fig. 7B) or GluOC (15Otani T. Matsuda M. Mizokami A. Kitagawa N. Takeuchi H. Jimi E. Inai T. Hirata M. Osteocalcin triggers Fas/FasL-mediated necroptosis in adipocytes via activation of p300.Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9: 1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous observation that GluOC induced cAMP accumulation in a GPRC6A-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (13Otani T. Mizokami A. Hayashi Y. Gao J. Mori Y. Nakamura S. Takeuchi H. Hirata M. Signaling pathway for adiponectin expression in adipocytes by osteocalcin.Cell. Signal. 2015; 27: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found that dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, mimicked the effects of GluOC and ornithine on ATGL expression and restored ATGL expression in GPRC6A knockdown cells (Fig. 7C). The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (PKI) 14-22 attenuated these effects (Fig. 7E). Finally, we confirmed the effect of deficiency in GPRC6A signaling observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using ex vivo culture of adipose tissue from control and adG6AKO mice. Ornithine and GluOC increased the abundance of ATGL in control adipose tissue but had no effect on GPRC6A-deficient adipose tissue (Fig. 7F). We also confirmed that db-cAMP stimulated ATGL expression as ornithine, GluOC, and the PKA inhibitor PKI 14-22 attenuated these effects in control adipose tissue (Fig. 7G). These results indicate that GPRC6A signaling triggered by ornithine or GluOC might induce lipolysis by increasing the expression of ATGL in adipose tissue. Here, we examined the role of GPRC6A expression in adipose tissue in the development of obesity. We found that adipocyte-specific Gprc6a deletion increased the susceptibility of mice to diet-induced obesity, with this effect being attributable to impaired lipolysis in adipose tissue and the consequent development of adipocyte hypertrophy. The obesity phenotype of adG6AKO mice was associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, inflammation in adipose tissue, and hepatic steatosis. We therefore propose that GPRC6A in adipose tissue is required for the regulation of global energy homeostasis, especially in an obesogenic setting. Two lines of global GPRC6A knockout mice have been shown to manifest an obese phenotype (9Pi M. Chen L. Huang M.-Z.Z. Zhu W. Ringhofer B. Luo J. Christenson L. Li B. Zhang J. Jackson P.D. Faber P.

One line was also found to be characterized by the development of metabolic syndrome, feminization of males, and osteopenia, although the underlying mechanisms were not addressed (9Pi M. Chen L. Huang M.-Z.Z. Zhu W. Ringhofer B. Luo J. Christenson L. Li B. Zhang J. Jackson P.D. Faber P. Brunden K.R. Harrington J.J. Quarles L.D. GPRC6A null mice exhibit osteopenia, feminization and metabolic syndrome.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The obese phenotype of the second line was shown to be due to hyperphagia and reduced locomotion and was associated with increased circulating insulin and leptin levels, impairment of glucose metabolism, and an increase in the expression of the Pomc gene (encoding pro-opiomelanocortin) in the hypothalamus, with this latter effect likely being because of the increased circulating insulin and leptin levels (10Clemmensen C. Smajilovic S. Madsen A.N. Klein A.B. Holst B. Bräuner-Osborne H. Increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity in GPRC6A receptor knockout mice.J. Endocrinol. 2013; 217: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given that Pomc expression in the hypothalamus reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure (21Schwartz M.W. Seeley R.J. Woods S.C. Weigle D.S. Campfield L.A. Burn P. Baskin D.G.

Endocrinol. 2013; 217: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have now found that ablation of GPRC6A in adipose tissue had no effect on food intake despite an increase in the serum leptin concentration, with leptin having been shown to reduce appetite. Leptin resistance, in addition to impaired lipolysis, might contribute to the development of diet-induced obesity in adG6AKO mice. The effect of adipose GPRC6A ablation on lipolysis was not as evident in female mice. This was probably because of the effect of estradiol, which makes females less susceptible to obesity (23Hong J.

Recently, aberrant androgen receptor (AR) signaling, including expression of the constitutively active ARV7, was reported to contribute to DTX resistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Of note, previous studies have highlighted that ARV7, unlike its parental AR, potentially favors the expression of some genes involved in cell cycle progression. Since DTX mainly targets microtubule dynamics and mitosis, we wanted to test whether ARV7 plays a specific role in mitotic regulation and whether this activity is involved in DTX resistance. In the present study, we found that ARV7 mediates DTX sensitivity through inactivating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and promoting mitotic slippage. By shifting the balance to the slippage pathway, ARV7-expressing cells are more likely to escape from mitotic death induced by acute DTX treatment. Furthermore, we also identified E2 enzyme UBE2C as the primary downstream effector of ARV7 in promoting the SAC inactivation and premature degradation of cyclin B1. Moreover, we showed that combination treatment of DTX and an inhibitor of mitotic exit can exert synergistic effect in high ARV7-expressing prostate cancer cells.

Despite considerable effort has been made in recent years, prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be one of the most common causes of cancer-dependent deaths in men worldwide (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2019.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2019; 69: 7-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (11535) Google Scholar). Since PCa cells rely on androgen receptor (AR) signaling for growth and survival, androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is considered as the major treatment option for PCa patients. However, although most of the patients initially respond to ADT well, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually occurs after several years and then progresses to metastatic diseases, leading to the treatment failure (2Karantanos T. Corn P.G. Thompson T.C. Prostate cancer progression after androgen deprivation therapy: Mechanisms of castrate resistance and novel therapeutic approaches.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 5501-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Notably, most CRPC cells are still dependent on active AR signaling for survival, which is primarily due to aberrant alterations of the AR pathway including gain-of-function mutations, overexpression of the AR gene, stimulation by other signaling pathways as well as expression of constitutively active AR-splicing variants (3Dai C. Heemers H. Sharifi N. Androgen signaling in prostate cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2017; 7a030452Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, expression of AR-splicing variants (ARVs) emerges as one crucial mechanism accounts for abnormal activation of the AR pathway (4Wadosky K.M. Koochekpour S. Androgen receptor splice variants and prostate cancer: From bench to bedside.Oncotarget. 2017; 8: 18550-18576Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In general, ARVs are characterized as shortened forms of AR, which lack the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Among all the identified variants, androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARV7) draws the most attention as it is the best studied ARV so far and also determined to be the most abundant form in cell lines, xenografts, and clinical samples (5Nakazawa M. Antonarakis E.S. Luo J. Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.Horm. Cancer. 2014; 5: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Accumulating studies have indicated that ARV7, no matter whether androgen is available, can constitutively localize to the nucleus and play a crucial role in PCa progression (6Ciccarese C. Santoni M. Brunelli M. Buti S. Modena A. Nabissi M. Artibani W. Martignoni G. Montironi R. Tortora G. Massari F. AR-V7 and prostate cancer: The watershed for treatment selection?.Cancer Treat. Rev. 2016; 43: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ARV7 is rarely detectable in primary PCa, but its level is dramatically increased in response to ADT (7Bastos D.A. Antonarakis E.S. CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2018; 18: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In one recently conducted sample analysis, ARV7 was found to present in over 75% of patients who received ADT and correlate with worse PSA responses and overall survival (8Sharp A. Coleman I. Yuan W. Sprenger C. Dolling D. Rodrigues D.N. Russo J.W. Figueiredo I. Bertan C. Seed G. Riisnaes R. Uo T. Neeb A. Welti J. Morrissey C. et al.Androgen receptor splice variant-7 expression emerges with castration resistance in prostate cancer.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129: 192-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is well known that ARV7 is capable of activating canonical AR downstream targets, mediating androgen-independent cell growth and resistance to AR-targeting therapy. Nevertheless, many studies have highlighted that ARV7 might also control a transcriptional program that is largely different from the one regulated by its parental AR (9Wang Q. Li W. Zhang Y. Yuan X. Xu K. Yu J. Chen Z. Beroukhim R. Wang H. Lupien M. Wu T. Regan M.M. Meyer C.A. Carroll J.S.

Yu B. Liu Y. Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.Life Sci. 2019; 234: 116768Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Specifically, expression of ARV7, but not AR, was positively correlated with the level of some cell cycle genes such as ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes 2C (UBE2C), raising the question that what are the roles of these unique regulations in PCa progression (12Hu R. Dunn T.A. Wei S. Isharwal S. Veltri R.W. Humphreys E. Han M. Partin A.W. Vessella R.L. Isaacs W.B. Bova G.S. Luo J. Ligand-independent androgen receptor variants derived from splicing of cryptic exons signify hormone-refractory prostate cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Docetaxel (DTX) has been the first-line drug for treating metastatic CRPC patients since 2004 although its effect is significantly impaired by the acquired drug resistance. Mechanistically, DTX can inhibit microtubule depolymerization, consequently activating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to arrest cells in mitosis and triggering apoptosis (13Pienta K.J. Preclinical mechanisms of action of docetaxel and docetaxel combinations in prostate cancer.Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 3-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unattached kinetochores lead to the formation of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) and suppression of Cdc20, rendering it unable to activate the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Thus, as the E3 ligase for both securin and cyclin B1, the APC/C is able to control the sister-chromatid separation and mitotic exit (14Lara-Gonzalez P. Westhorpe F.G. Taylor S.S. The spindle assembly checkpoint.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R966-R980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 15Yu H. Regulation of APC-Cdc20 by the spindle checkpoint.Curr.

Cell. 2013; 51: 92-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, some cancer cells can prematurely degrade cyclin B1 before reaching the apoptotic signal intensity required for initiating mitotic cell death. By doing so, cells are able to exit mitosis without proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, through a process defined as mitotic slippage (17Cheng B. Crasta K. Consequences of mitotic slippage for antimicrotubule drug therapy.Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2017; 24: T97-T106Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Brito D.A. Rieder C.L.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1194-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). It is postulated that mitotic slippage can facilitate cancer cells to escape from taxol-induced cell death, leading to drug resistance (19Shi J. Orth J.D. Mitchison T. Cell type variation in responses to antimitotic drugs that target microtubules and kinesin-5.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Ma H.T. Chan Y.Y. Chen X.

Thus, deciphering how the SAC is precisely regulated is crucial for understanding the potential mechanism for DTX resistance. Importantly, previous studies have indicated that expression of ARV7 can promote DTX resistance in PCa (21Komura K. Jeong S.H. Hinohara K. Qu F. Wang X. Hiraki M. Azuma H. Lee G.S. Kantoff P.W.

Cancer Res. 2019; 25: 1880-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Of note, ARV7 was shown to utilize distinct pathways of nuclear import and also promote the nuclear localization of other ARVs during disease progression (24Zhan Y. Zhang G. Wang X. Qi Y. Bai S.

Androgen receptor splice variants determine taxane sensitivity in prostate cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 2270-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how ARV7 exerts its function during controlling the fate of PCa cells under DTX treatment remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provided data to demonstrate that ARV7 promotes the survival of PCa cells under DTX treatment by inactivating the SAC and promoting mitotic slippage, offering a novel mechanism to explain how ARV7 contributes to DTX resistance. First of all, we modified the expression level of ARV7 in several PCa cell lines to check whether ARV7 promotes oncogenic behaviors as we proposed. To our surprise, overexpression (OE) of ARV7 in C4-2 and PC-3 cells, both of which express undetectable level of endogenous ARV7, did not obviously benefit the growth of these cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, we did not observe recognizable difference between ARV7 OE cells and control cells in cell cycle profile (Fig. 1C). However, in long-term culturing condition, ARV7-expressing cells showed significant stronger ability to form colonies than control group in both cell lines (Fig. 1D). Strikingly, depletion of endogenous ARV7 significantly impairs the growth of 22RV-1 cells, which normally express high level ARV7 (data not shown). Moreover, knockdown of ARV7 dramatically changes the cell cycle profile as more cells were arrested in G2/M phase (Fig. 1E). Consistent with those observations, ARV7 depletion almost completely abolished the colony formation ability of 22RV-1 cells (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data indicate that ARV7 promotes the oncogenic behaviors of PCa cells and might play an important role in cell cycle progression. Then, we used the methods above to investigate whether ARV7 level affects DTX sensitivity. Firstly, we found that C4-2 cells with stable ARV7 OE were more resistant to different concentrations of DTX treatments than cells infected with vector control (Fig. 2A). Moreover, as shown in Figure 2B, under DTX treatment, ARV7 OE cells induced much weaker level of apoptosis than control cells, which was indicated by less PARP cleavage. Consistently, similar results were obtained in PC-3 cells (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, after we depleted endogenous ARV7 in 22RV-1 cells, enhanced response to DTX treatment was observed (Fig. 2D). However, degradation of AR and ARV7 is not a major contributor to DTX cytotoxicity as we did not observe obvious change in the degradation rate of both AR and ARV7 after DTX treatment (Fig. 2E). Of note, under long time exposure to 0.5 nM DTX, ARV7-expressing C4-2 cells were able to form much more clones than control cells (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, as indicated in Figure 2G, upon modifying the level of ARV7, we did not detect obvious change of some apoptotic regulators, which were reported to be crucial for taxol-mediated mitotic death, including MCL-1 and BH3-only proteins, Bim and Bid (26Haschka M. Karbon G. Fava L.L. Villunger A. Perturbing mitosis for anti-cancer therapy: Is cell death the only answer?.EMBO Rep. 2018; 19e45440Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Sloss O. Topham C. Diez M. Taylor S. Mcl-1 dynamics influence mitotic slippage and death in mitosis.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 5176-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In sum, these data indicate that ARV7 expression level is closely related to cellular sensitivity to DTX in vitro, but the intrinsic apoptosis regulators are not affected. Two independent networks compete with each other to determine the cell fate after microtubule poisons treatment, the mitotic death pathway slowly accumulates a death signal, and the mitotic slippage pathway slowly degrades cyclin B1, leading to mitotic exit. Since we didn’t detect obvious change of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway after modifying ARV7 expression level, we speculated that cells with ARV7 OE may have different cell cycle progression speed upon DTX treatment. Indeed, we found that after we released C4-2 cells from DTX treatment, cells with ARV7 OE showed increased degradation speed of cyclin B1 compared with control group (Fig. 3A). Also, the level of mitotic marker p-H3 (ser10) detected in ARV7 OE group dropped much faster and ARV7 OE group showed less p-H3 positive cells than control group, indicating that ARV7 OE group can exit DTX-induced mitotic arrest more quickly (Fig. 3, B and C). Consistently, we also observed similar results in PC-3 cells (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, DTX arrested cells showed slower speed to exit mitosis when we depleted endogenous ARV7 in 22RV-1 cells (Fig. 3E). Because cells undergoing mitotic slippage can exit mitosis without cytokinesis and subsequently generate multinucleated cells, we next designed experiments to check whether ARV7 regulates this process after DTX treatment. As the data shown in Figure 3F, after different time exposure to low concentration of DTX, ARV7 OE group contained more cells with DNA content more than 4N and even DNA content with 8N, representing aneuploid and polyploid cells, respectively. To further confirm this observation, we also quantified the percentage of multinucleated cells using immunofluorescence images. The data showed that under low-dosage DTX treatment, ARV7 OE group displayed more multinucleated cells than control group (Fig. 3, G and H). Collectively, those data indicate that ARV7 promotes mitotic slippage under DTX treatment. In order to induce slippage from DTX-induced mitotic arrest, the MCC must be disassembled and the coactivator Cdc20 has to be released to enable reactivation of the APC/C. Indeed, when we overexpressed Cdc20 to increase free Cdc20 level in the cells, cells were more resistant to DTX treatment and could exit from DTX-induced mitotic arrest more easily (Fig. 4, A and B). Previous study has identified that Cdc20 needs to be multiubiquitinated by the APC/C before releasing from the MCC. Hence, we checked the ubiquitination level of Cdc20 upon modifying the ARV7 expression level in PCa cells. As shown in Figure 4C, ubiquitination level of Cdc20 was significantly higher in ARV7-expressing cells after DTX release. Moreover, the bindings between Cdc20 and two crucial MCC components, including Mad2 and BubR1, were impaired in ARV7 OE cells, suggesting that ARV7 inhibits the stability of the MCC (Fig. 4D). In addition, when we depleted endogenous ARV7 in 22RV-1 cells, the poly-ubiquitination level of cdc20 was reduced while the bindings between cdc20 and the MCC components were enhanced during DTX arrest and release treatment (Fig. 4, E and F). Taken together, these results above suggest that ARV7 inactivates the SAC through promoting the disassembly of Cdc20 from the MCC during DTX treatment. Next, we move on to investigate how ARV7 regulates mitotic slippage and the SAC activity by checking some of its potential targets. On the basis of previous analysis, we found that ARV7 expression is positively correlated with many genes involved in mitotic progression, microtubule dynamic, and kinetochore functions, all of which are closely related to the cellular effect of DTX. Among those targets with high enrichment scores, UBE2C is one of the cell-cycle-related genes considered to be actively involved in mitotic exit (Fig. 5A). Of note, UBE2C is also demonstrated to be the E2 enzyme required for the APC/C to degrade cyclin B1 and also crucial for the SAC inactivation (28Xie C. Powell C. Yao M. Wu J. Dong Q. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C: A potential cancer biomarker.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2014; 47: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Reddy S.K. Rape M. Margansky W.A. Kirschner M.W. Ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex drives spindle checkpoint inactivation.Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we believe that UBE2C might be the core downstream factor of ARV7 to regulate the mitotic slippage pathway. Firstly, consistent with the role of UBE2C in mitotic exit, we found that upon UBE2C depletion, cells showed increased mitotic index (Fig. 5B). More importantly, UBE2C-depleted cells showed slower degradation rate of cyclin B1 and p-H3 (ser10) after releasing from DTX treatment, indicating that it is more difficult for cells with UBE2C silencing to recover from DTX-induced mitotic arrest (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, much less multinucleated cells were observed in shUBE2C group than control group under low-dosage DTX treatment (Fig. 5, E, images not shown). These data strongly suggest that UBE2C plays a crucial role in mitotic slippage. In support of these observations, we also found that after UBE2C depletion, the ubiquitination level of Cdc20 after DTX release was decreased while the bindings between Cdc20 and Mad2/BubR1 were enhanced (Fig. 5, F and G). Next, we checked whether UBE2C affects cellular sensitivity to DTX. As Figure 5, H and I shows, UBE2C depleted cells were more sensitive to DTX treatment than control cells and DTX tended to induce stronger apoptosis level in shUBE2C group. In sum, these data demonstrate that UBE2C is a crucial molecule responsible for regulating mitotic slippage and DTX sensitivity. To further confirm that ARV7 mediates DTX sensitivity through the mitotic slippage pathway and UBE2C, we performed the following experiments. Firstly, we found that if we cotreated cells with the APC/C specific inhibitor proTAME, OE of ARV7 cannot promote survival of PCa cells under the treatment of DTX as efficient as previously shown (Fig. 6, A and B). Since proTAME can efficiently inhibit mitotic exit, ARV7 might at least partially lose its beneficial effect on survival during the mitotic arrest condition (Fig. 6C). Importantly, as illustrated in Figure 6, D and E, when we depleted UBE2C under the condition of ARV7 OE, ARV7 not only loses its ability to significantly increase cell survival but also fails to efficiently promote premature mitotic exit after DTX treatment. Furthermore, ARV7-depleted 22RV-1 cells can regain their resistance to DTX treatment after we overexpressed UBE2C using plasmid (Fig. 6F). Overall, these data above support our proposed model that ARV7 mediates DTX sensitivity through the mitotic exit and UBE2C regulation (Fig. 6G). Based on these observations, we speculated that combination of the APC/C inhibitor and DTX will have a synergistic effect in ARV7-expressing PCa cells. As a result, although single treatment with high-concentration proTAME had little effect on the survival of 22RV-1 cells, cotreatment with proTAME significantly increased the cytotoxicity of DTX, suggesting a strong synergistic effect of these two drugs in ARV7-expressing PCa cells (Fig. 7A). In addition, combination treatment of 22RV-1 cells with DTX and proTAME induced much stronger level of apoptosis than single drug treatment (Fig. 7B). Consistently, we also observed the similar results using ARV7-expressing PC-3 cells (Fig. 7C). Finally, under longer treatment time, DTX and proTAME act synergistically to inhibit colony formation of ARV7-expressing PC-3 cells (Fig. 7D). Thus, although we cannot calculate the combination index for these two drugs due to the high IC50 of proTAME in the PCa cell lines, we were able to observe the strong synergy in inhibiting the viability of ARV7-expressing PCa cells (Fig. 7E). Although DTX has been long served as the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for mCRPC, precisely how it exerts cytotoxic effects is perplexing. This is largely due to the fate of cells after prolonged mitotic arrest varies dramatically in different cell lines and even among individual cells from the same line. Recently, researchers believe that the cell fate after DTX treatment appears to be determined by two independent and competing networks, one controlling mitotic cell death and the other mediating mitotic slippage. Mitotic slippage occurs in the presence of the SAC signaling, which is crucial for cells to escape from DTX-induced mitotic arrest (26Haschka M. Karbon G. Fava L.L. Villunger A. Perturbing mitosis for anti-cancer therapy: Is cell death the only answer?.EMBO Rep. 2018; 19e45440Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, how the MCC stability and the APC/C activity are actively controlled during PCa progression remains largely unknown. Based on previous findings, ARV7 not only serves as the major contributing factor for CRPC progression but also demonstrated to promote DTX resistance even the detailed mechanisms are lacking. The notion that unlike its parental AR, ARV7 might regulate a set of cell-cycle-related genes motivates us to investigate the unique role of ARV7 in cell cycle regulation (Fig. 5A). Strikingly, we found that depletion of ARV7 in 22RV-1 cells dramatically induced mitotic arrest (Fig. 1E). Because mitotic progression and the SAC activity are vital for DTX-induced cell death, finding the potential relationship between ARV7 and these processes is of great significance in order to understand the role of ARV7 in DTX resistance. In this study, we are the first group to show that ARV7 mediates DTX sensitivity through inactivating the SAC and promoting mitotic slippage rather than affecting the apoptotic regulators. Consistent with our findings, previous experiments have shown that taxol-resistant cells have impaired activity of the SAC and enhanced expression of ARV7 (22Zhang G. Liu X. Li J. Ledet E. Alvarez X.

Furthermore, we also identified UBE2C as the downstream effector of ARV7 to regulate the MCC disassociation and the APC/C reactivation. Interestingly, UBE2C was initially identified as a target of AR-FL during androgen-independent state (9Wang Q. Li W. Zhang Y. Yuan X. Xu K. Yu J. Chen Z. Beroukhim R. Wang H. Lupien M. Wu T. Regan M.M. Meyer C.A. Carroll J.S. Manrai A.K. et al.Androgen receptor regulates a distinct transcription program in androgen-independent prostate cancer.Cell. 2009; 138: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In addition, some of the ARV-mediated oncogenic functions were shown to be dependent on AR-FL, suggesting that ARV expression serves as an adaptive reaction to hormone therapy and the interplay between AR-FL and ARV might play a crucial role in mediating those processes (31Watson P.A. Chen Y.F. Balbas M.D. Wongvipat J. Socci N.D. Viale A. Kim K. Sawyers C.L.

A. 2010; 107: 16759-16765Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, following studies have claimed that ARV7 is the major driver for those mitotic genes and the promoter of UBE2C was bound by AR-V7 only (32Cao B. Qi Y. Zhang G. Xu D. Zhan Y. Alvarez X.

Thus, it is necessary to further investigate the regulatory mechanism of UBE2C expression under different AR-FL/ARV7 context in future experiments. Of note, some earlier experiments have demonstrated that cells overexpressing UBE2C ignore the mitotic spindle checkpoint signals and lose genomic stability, which contributes to cancer progression (34van Ree J.H.

Considering that UBE2C plays a crucial role in the APC/C activation, and Cdc20 was also indicated to be regulated by ARV7 in earlier reports, it is important to further investigate"
https://openalex.org/W3119374267,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen requiring iron for its survival and virulence. P. aeruginosa can acquire iron from heme via the nonredundant heme assimilation system and Pseudomonas heme uptake (Phu) systems. Heme transported by either the heme assimilation system or Phu system is sequestered by the cytoplasmic protein PhuS. Furthermore, PhuS has been shown to specifically transfer heme to the iron-regulated heme oxygenase HemO. As the PhuS homolog ShuS from Shigella dysenteriae was observed to bind DNA as a function of its heme status, we sought to further determine if PhuS, in addition to its role in regulating heme flux through HemO, functions as a DNA-binding protein. Herein, through a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation–PCR, EMSA, and fluorescence anisotropy, we show that apo-PhuS but not holo-PhuS binds upstream of the tandem iron-responsive sRNAs prrF1,F2. Previous studies have shown the PrrF sRNAs are required for sparing iron for essential proteins during iron starvation. Furthermore, under certain conditions, a heme-dependent read through of the prrF1 terminator yields the longer PrrH transcript. Quantitative PCR analysis of P. aeruginosa WT and ΔphuS strains shows that loss of PhuS abrogates the heme-dependent regulation of PrrF and PrrH levels. Taken together, our data show that PhuS, in addition to its role in extracellular heme metabolism, also functions as a transcriptional regulator by modulating PrrF and PrrH levels in response to heme. This dual function of PhuS is central to integrating extracellular heme utilization into the PrrF/PrrH sRNA regulatory network that is critical for P. aeruginosa adaptation and virulence within the host.

This dual function of PhuS is central to integrating extracellular heme utilization into the PrrF/PrrH sRNA regulatory network that is critical for P. aeruginosa adaptation and virulence within the host. Bacterial pathogens must acquire iron from their host for survival and virulence where because of its reactivity, it is tightly regulated and sequestered in iron-binding proteins, such as transferrin and ferritin, or in heme and iron–sulfur cluster–containing proteins. Iron is further limited within the host during infection by the hosts' innate immune response that includes the secretion of high-affinity iron-binding proteins, such as lipocalin 2, and hepcidin-dependent downregulation of plasma iron levels (1Johnson E.E. Wessling-Resnick M. Iron metabolism and the innate immune response to infection.Microbes Infect. 2012; 14: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To circumvent this nutritional immunity, invading pathogens possess several acquisition strategies to acquire iron, and many encode systems for the utilization of heme (2Hood M.I. Skaar E.P.

The gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes two heme uptake systems; the heme assimilation system (Has) and the Pseudomonas heme uptake (Phu) system (6Ochsner U.A. Johnson Z. Vasil M.L. Genetics and regulation of two distinct haem-uptake systems, phu and has, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The Has and Phu systems were shown to have nonredundant roles in heme sensing and transport, respectively (7Smith A.D. Wilks A. Differential contributions of the outer membrane receptors PhuR and HasR to heme acquisition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 7756-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Has system encodes an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ/anti-σ factor system, HasIS (6Ochsner U.A. Johnson Z. Vasil M.L. Genetics and regulation of two distinct haem-uptake systems, phu and has, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). ECF σ factors are a subfamily of alternative σ70 factors that allow for transcriptional amplification of genes involved in extracellular stress-response functions (8Mascher T. Signaling diversity and evolution of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Helmann J.D. The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2002; 46: 47-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The secreted hemophore HasAp on interaction with the outer membrane receptor HasR triggers activation of the ECF σ/anti-σ factor system HasIS. However, heme transported by either the HasR or the PhuR outer membrane receptors is translocated to the cytoplasm by the phu-encoded ABC transporter PhuUV and its cognate periplasmic heme-binding protein PhuT. Previous studies have shown that the cytoplasmic heme-binding protein PhuS regulates the flux of heme into the cell through a specific interaction with the iron-regulated heme oxygenase, HemO (10Lansky I.B. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Block D. Rodgers K.R. Ratliff M. Wilks A. The cytoplasmic heme-binding protein (PhuS) from the heme uptake system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an intracellular heme-trafficking protein to the delta-regioselective heme oxygenase.J. Biol.

The P. aeruginosa heme binding protein PhuS is a heme oxygenase titratable regulator of heme uptake.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HemO oxidatively cleaves heme to release iron, CO, and biliverdin (BV) IXβ and IXδ (12Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the HemO metabolite BVIXβ and/or BVIXδ is a post-transcriptional regulator of HasAp protein levels (13Dent A.T. Mourino S. Huang W. Wilks A.

Chem. 2019; 294: 2771-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the PhuS–HemO couple regulates both the flux of heme into the cell and the extracellular heme signal through the heme metabolites, BVIXβ and IXδ. The complexity of P. aeruginosa iron and heme homeostasis is further exemplified by the tandem arrangement of the PrrF1 and PrrF2 sRNAs found directly downstream of the phu operon (Fig. 1A) (14Wilderman P.J. Sowa N.A. FitzGerald D.J. FitzGerald P.C. Gottesman S. Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Identification of tandem duplicate regulatory small RNAs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in iron homeostasis.Proc.

The PrrF sRNAs are highly homologous to one another and contribute to iron homeostasis by causing mRNA degradation of nonessential iron-containing proteins (14Wilderman P.J. Sowa N.A. FitzGerald D.J.

Immun. 2015; 83: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The PrrF sRNAs play a role in numerous other processes, including twitching motility, quorum sensing molecule production, and biofilm formation. Furthermore, this tandem arrangement allows for the expression of an overlapping noncoding RNA, PrrH, whose expression is heme dependent (17Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Vasil M.L. Characterization of a heme-regulated non-coding RNA encoded by the prrF locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS One. 2010; 5e9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The duplication of the prrF genes and the presence of phuS are genetically linked and found in pathogenic P. aeruginosa but not in other Pseudomonads (Fig. 1A) (17Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Vasil M.L. Characterization of a heme-regulated non-coding RNA encoded by the prrF locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS One. 2010; 5e9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PrrH is detected in infected murine lungs as well as sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis suggesting a role for this sRNA during infection (18Reinhart A.A. Nguyen A.T. Brewer L.K.

Chem. 2009; 284: 56-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies have shown that the Shigella dysenteriae ShuS, a homolog of PhuS, has DNA-binding properties (20Kaur A.P. Wilks A. Heme inhibits the DNA binding properties of the cytoplasmic heme binding protein of Shigella dysenteriae (ShuS).Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2994-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Based on these previous studies, we hypothesized that PhuS may also possess DNA-binding properties providing a functional link between PhuS and the prrF1,F2 locus. To test this hypothesis, we performed a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments to determine the functional link between PhuS and prrF locus. Herein, through chromatin immunoprecipitation–PCR (ChIP–PCR), EMSA, and fluorescence anisotropy (FA), we show that apo-PhuS binds with high affinity to the promoter of prrF1 but not that of prrF2. Furthermore, comparison of the relative expression of PrrF and PrrH in the PAO1 WT and ΔphuS allelic strains by quantitative PCR (qPCR) shows a loss in the heme-dependent regulation of PrrH in the absence of PhuS. We propose that PhuS has a dual function integrating extracellular heme metabolism into the iron-homeostasis networks through transcriptional modulation of the PrrF/PrrH sRNAs. The potential for PhuS to bind to the prrF1 promoter was analyzed by subjecting P. aeruginosa (PAO1) WT or the ΔphuS deletion strain to ChIP followed by PCR amplification, employing primers specific for the prrF1 promoter (Table S1). Following DNAse digestion, reversal of the formaldehyde crosslinking, and sequencing, we determined a ∼230 bp fragment upstream of the prrF1/prrH promoter that includes part of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) box sequence (Fig. 1, B and C). We repeated the pull downs with purified genomic DNA (gDNA; 100–500 bp sheared fragments) and addition of purified His-tagged PhuS (PhuS-His6) to PAO1 WT. Nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni–NTA) pull down, DNAse treatment, and PCR amplification with the primer pairs shown in Figure 1B identified bands of ∼230, 180, and 120 bp, which following sequencing confirmed binding to the prrF1 promoter (Fig. S1). Because of the high sequence identity (>95%) between PrrF1 and PrrF2, we were unable to design primers to specifically probe PhuS binding to the prrF2 promoter. PhuS binding to the prrF2 promoter was analyzed by FA (see the next section). Interestingly, the DNA fragment isolated by ChIP–PCR included the prrF1 Fur box (Fig. 1B). Utilizing FA, we analyzed Fur and PhuS binding to a 5′-fluoroscein amidite (5′-FAM)–labeled 30 bp oligonucleotide encoding the Fur box alone (prrF1-30) (Fig. 2A and Table S2). The change in anisotropy on addition of Fur when fit to a one-to-one binding site model gave a binding constant (KD) of 50 ± 10 nM (Fig. 2A). In contrast, addition of apo-PhuS to prrF1-30 showed a much smaller change in anisotropy with a KD >2 μM (Fig. 2B). However, titration of a 5′-FAM–labeled oligonucleotide that includes sequence upstream of the Fur box (prrF1-50) significantly enhanced PhuS binding (Fig. 2B and Table S2). The change in anisotropy when fit to a one-to-one binding site model gave a KD of 64 ± 10 nM (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a 5′-FAM–labeled oligonucleotide encompassing the upstream sequence but lacking the Fur box showed no change in anisotropy (Fig. S2A and Table S2). Therefore, the optimal binding of PhuS to the prrF1 promoter requires sequence upstream of and including the Fur box. To confirm PhuS specificity for the prrF1 promoter over that of prrF2, we performed FA on 5′-FAM–labeled oligonucleotides designed within the prrF1,prrF2 intergenic region (Table S2). Incremental addition of apo-PhuS to 5′-FAM–labeled oligonucleotides prrF2-50 (Fur) including the Fur box or the upstream prrF2-50 (AlgR), which includes the AlgR site (Fig. 1B and Table S2), showed no change in anisotropy (Fig. S2A), confirming PhuS specificity for the prrF1 promoter. Following characterization of the PhuS-binding region, we next sought to determine if heme and DNA binding were mutually exclusive. In contrast to apo-PhuS, the addition of holo-PhuS to the 5′-FAM–labeled prrF1-50 oligonucleotide showed no change in anisotropy (Fig. S2B). The FA analysis was confirmed with EMSAs of apo-PhuS and holo-PhuS binding to a 5′-biotinylated prrF1-50 oligonucleotide. Addition of increasing concentrations of apo-PhuS gave a lower mobility complex consistent with apo-PhuS binding to prrF1-50 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, addition of holo-PhuS showed no shift in biotinylated prrF1-50 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, the data are consistent with heme and DNA binding being mutually exclusive functions of PhuS. Our previous studies characterized PhuS as a titratable regulator of heme flux through HemO (11O'Neill M.J. Wilks A. The P. aeruginosa heme binding protein PhuS is a heme oxygenase titratable regulator of heme uptake.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that heme flux through HemO may be coupled to PhuS regulation of the prrF1,2 operon. We tested the ability of HemO to drive the holo-PhuS to apo-PhuS conversion and subsequent DNA binding to apo-PhuS by FA and EMSA. On titration of a fixed concentration of holo-PhuS and 5′-biotinylated prrF1-50 with increasing concentrations of apo-HemO, we observe a lower mobility complex, consistent with apo-PhuS binding to prrF1-50 (Fig. 4A). To confirm the lower mobility complex is not because of HemO binding, we performed EMSA by titrating in increasing concentrations of apo-HemO. As shown in Fig. S3, titration of apo-HemO showed no shift in the 5′-biotinylated prrF1-50. Similarly, by FA analysis, titration of a fixed concentration of holo-PhuS (1 μM) and 5′-FAM-labeled prrF1-50 (10 nM) with HemO, we observe an increase in anisotropy. The change in anisotropy when fit to a one-to-one binding site model shows saturation at ∼1:1 M equivalency of HemO to PhuS (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the competing equilibrium between heme transfer from holo-PhuS to HemO and apo-PhuS binding to prrF1-50, we observe a twofold to threefold decrease in the calculated KD (140 ± 30 nM). We have previously shown that apo-PhuS undergoes a significant conformational rearrangement on heme binding (21Deredge D.J. Huang W. Hui C. Matsumura H. Yue Z. Moenne-Loccoz P. Shen J. Wintrode P.L. Wilks A. Ligand-induced allostery in the interaction of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa heme binding protein with heme oxygenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 3421-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which likely accounts for the mutually exclusive roles in DNA binding and heme transfer. Furthermore, through site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopic studies, we proposed a model where a conformational rearrangement on protein–protein interaction triggers a ligand switch within PhuS (from H209 to H212) prior to release to HemO. Furthermore, while the apo-PhuS H212R mutant rapidly binds heme, the rate of heme transfer to HemO is inhibited (21Deredge D.J. Huang W. Hui C. Matsumura H. Yue Z. Moenne-Loccoz P. Shen J. Wintrode P.L. Wilks A. Ligand-induced allostery in the interaction of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa heme binding protein with heme oxygenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 3421-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We sought to determine if the altered heme binding and transfer properties of this PhuS H212R mutant influenced binding to the prrF1 promoter. We confirmed by FA that apo-PhuS H212R binds to 5′-FAM–labeled prrF1-50 with a KD of 90 ± 30 nM (Fig. 5A). Although we saw a decrease in the binding affinity and fraction bound, EMSA analysis showed a shift consistent with complex formation (Fig. 5B). Titration of a fixed concentration of holo-PhuS H212R and 5′-FAM-labeled prrF1-50 (10 nM) with HemO drives apo-PhuS binding. However, consistent with the inhibition of heme transfer, a significantly greater molar ratio of HemO to holo-PhuS H212R (5:1) is required to drive the reaction toward completion when compared with holo-PhuS WT (Fig. 4C). To assess the role of PhuS in transcriptional regulation of prrF1 and/or prrH, we performed qPCR analysis of PAO1 WT, a phuS knockout (ΔphuS) and the phuSH212R allelic strain in low iron- and heme-supplemented conditions. All the strains utilized had similar growth rates in iron-deplete or heme-supplemented conditions (Fig. S4). Through a combination of isotopic 13C-heme uptake followed by LC–MS/MS and inductively coupled plasma—MS, we have previously shown that 1 μM of heme-supplemented cultures deplete the exogenous heme by 7 to 8 h, resulting in Fur repression (13Dent A.T. Mourino S. Huang W. Wilks A. Post-transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa heme assimilation system (Has) fine-tunes extracellular heme sensing.J. Biol.

Chem. 2020; 295: 10456-10467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the relative PrrF and PrrH levels at 2 and 5 h where heme flux through PhuS is maximal and prior to Fur repression. The PrrF probe (Table S2) detects PrrF, PrrF2, and PrrH sRNAs owing to the similarity and overlap in sequences. In contrast, the PrrH probe comprising the unique intergenic sequence between prrF1 and prrF2 detects PrrH specifically (Table S2). Given the previously reported low abundance of PrrH compared with PrrF1 and PrrF2 (17Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Vasil M.L. Characterization of a heme-regulated non-coding RNA encoded by the prrF locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS One. 2010; 5e9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the contribution of PrrH to the relative RNA levels measured with the PrrF probe is negligible. In iron-deplete conditions, we see an approximately twofold increase in PrrF at 5 h consistent with iron deprivation (Fig. 6A; left panel). However, in heme-supplemented conditions at 2 h, we observe an initial approximately twofold decrease in the relative PrrF levels. Nevertheless, at 5 h, the relative expression of PrrF on heme supplementation is identical to that in low iron conditions (Fig. 6A; left panel). We have previously observed a similar heme-dependent decrease in relative RNA levels at the early 2 h time point for Fur-regulated genes within the has and phu operons (13Dent A.T. Mourino S. Huang W. Wilks A. Post-transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa heme assimilation system (Has) fine-tunes extracellular heme sensing.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 2771-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Mourino S. Giardina B.J. Reyes-Caballero H. Wilks A.

Chem. 2016; 291: 20503-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We attribute this decrease to an initial effect of the influx of heme or iron. In contrast to PrrF, PrrH levels show no increase over time in low iron (Fig. 6B; right panel). However, in heme-supplemented conditions, we see a significant threefold to fourfold increase in PrrH levels at 5 h (Fig. 6B; right panel). Furthermore, at the 2 h time point, we do not observe the initial decrease in the relative expression of PrrH as seen for PrrF. Therefore, in contrast to PrrF, which is under transcriptional regulation of Fur, PrrH is not iron regulated but is subject to positive regulation by heme. To confirm that the heme-dependent increase in PrrH expression is indeed mediated by PhuS, we performed qPCR analysis on the ΔphuS strain. In low iron, we observe an approximately twofold increase in PrrF expression at the earlier 2 h time point in the ΔphuS strain (Fig. 6A; middle panel). Interestingly, the decrease in relative expression of PrrF in heme-supplemented conditions compared with low iron is significantly enhanced in the ΔphuS strain compared with PAO1 WT (Fig. 6A; middle panel). On heme supplementation, we observe a loss in the heme-dependent regulation of PrrH in the ΔphuS strain (Fig. 6B; middle panel). Deletion of PhuS not only leads to a loss in the heme-dependent increase in PrrH expression but also appears to increase the iron effect over the prrF1 promoter. Given the partial overlapping binding sites of PhuS and Fur, it is possible that the absence of PhuS may allow for increased access to the Fur box and enhanced repression of PrrF in the ΔphuS knockout. Although not statistically significant, in low iron, the loss of PhuS appears to show slightly elevated levels of PrrF relative to PAO1 WT (Fig. 6A). Taken together, the data suggest that PhuS binding as a function of heme status regulates the relative expression of PrrF1 and PrrH through modulation of Fur binding. Based on the increased molar ratio of HemO required to drive PhuS H212R binding to the prrF1 promoter in vitro, we sought to determine if such changes in heme binding and transfer influence PrrH expression. The relative expression profiles of both PrrF1 and PrrH in the phuSH212R allelic strain were very similar to that of PAO1 WT in both low iron and heme (Fig. 6, A and B; right panels). Taken together, the decrease in binding affinity and shift in the molar ratio of HemO required to drive apo-PhuS DNA binding in vitro are not significant enough to disrupt the PhuS–HemO equilibrium in vivo. Future studies with variants disrupting either heme transfer or the PhuS–HemO protein–protein interaction will be undertaken to investigate the role of extracellular heme flux on PrrF and PrrH expression. Iron acquisition and homeostasis are critical for P. aeruginosa survival and pathogenesis. Bacterial iron homeostasis is maintained by either repressing the expression of iron-uptake systems in iron-replete conditions or by decreasing the levels of iron-containing proteins in iron-limiting conditions. The latter function is most often mediated at the post-transcriptional level by iron-responsive sRNAs, which in many cases also regulate virulence traits (14Wilderman P.J. Sowa N.A. FitzGerald D.J.

In P. aeruginosa, the PrrF sRNAs play a role in numerous other processes, including twitching motility, quorum sensing molecule biosynthesis, and biofilm formation (16Reinhart A.A. Powell D.A.

Specific PrrF targets include the iron-containing proteins superoxide dismutase (sodB), succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), and a heme-containing catalase (katG) (14Wilderman P.J. Sowa N.A. FitzGerald D.J. FitzGerald P.C. Gottesman S. Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Identification of tandem duplicate regulatory small RNAs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in iron homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad.

PrrF also indirectly promotes the production of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) by repressing antR, an activator of genes required for degradation of the PQS biosynthetic precursor anthranilate (15Oglesby A.G.

Therefore, the PrrF sRNAs contribute to virulence through both the iron-sparing response and the activation of PQS-regulated virulence factors.

https://openalex.org/W3119405057,"Species dissimilarity (beta diversity) primarily reflects the spatio–temporal changes in the species composition of a plant community. The correlations between β diversity and environmental factors and spatial distance can be used to explain the magnitudes of environmental filtering and dispersal. However, little is known about the relative roles and importance of neutral and niche-related factors in the assemblage of plant communities with different life forms in deserts. We found that in desert ecosystems, the β diversity of herbaceous plants was the highest, followed by that of shrubs and trees. The changes in the β diversity of herbs and shrubs had stronger correlations with the environment, indicating that community aggregation was strongly affected by niche processes. The soil water content and salt content were the key environmental factors affecting species distributions of the herb and shrub layers, respectively. Spatial distance explained a larger amount of the variation in tree composition, indicating that dispersal limitation was the main factor affecting the construction of the tree layer community. The results suggest that different life forms may determine the association between organisms and the environment. These findings suggest that the spatial patterns of plant community species in the Ebinur Lake desert ecosystem are the result of the combined effects of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation."

Yet, little is known whether the existing food supply in Africa is in conformity with these goals or not. We evaluated the African food balances against the recommendations for macronutrients, free sugars, types of fatty acids, cholesterol and fruits and vegetables over 1990 to 2017, and provided regional, sub-regional and country-level estimates. Methods The per capita supply of 95 food commodities for 45 African countries (1990–2017) was accessed from the FAOSTAT database and converted into calories, carbohydrate, fat, protein, free sugars, cholesterol, saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids contents using the Food Data Central database. The supply of fruits and vegetables was also computed. Results In Africa the energy supply increased by 16.6% from 2,685 in 1990 to 3,132 kcal/person/day in 2017. However, the energy contribution of carbohydrate, fat and protein remained constant and almost within acceptable range around 73, 10 and 9%, respectively. In 2017, calories from fats surpassed the 20% limit in upper-middle- or high-income and Southern Africa countries. Energy from SFA remained within range (&lt;10%) but that of PUFA was below the minimum desirable level of 6% in 28 countries. Over the period, energy from free sugars remained constant around 7% but the figure exceeded the limit of 10% in upper-middle- or high-income countries (14.7%) and in Southern (14.8%) and Northern (10.5%) sub-regions. Between 1990 and 2017 the availability of dietary cholesterol per person surged by 14% but was below the upper limit of 300 mg/day. The supply of fruits and vegetables increased by 27.5% from 279 to 356 g/capita/day; yet, with the exception of Northern Africa, the figure remained below the target of 400 g/capita/day in all sub-regions. Conclusion According to this population level data, in Africa most population intake goals are within acceptable range. Yet, the supply of fruits and vegetables and PUFAs are suboptimal and the increasing energy contributions of free sugars and fats are emerging concerns in specific sub-regions."

Comparison of membrane proteins in each sample identified several that seem to interact with PRELP; among them, we noted two growth factor receptors, insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFI-R) and low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75NTR), interactions with which might help to explain PRELP’s links to cancer. We demonstrated that PRELP directly binds to extracellular domains of these two growth factor receptors with low micromolar affinities by surface plasmon resonance analysis using recombinant proteins. Furthermore, cell-based analysis using recombinant PRELP protein showed that PRELP suppressed cell growth and affected cell morphology of A549 lung carcinoma cells, also at micromolar concentration.

Another SLRP, Tsukushi, is an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway by binding to Frizzled4, competing with Wnt2b and thus prevents Wnt activation through β-catenin-dependent signaling. The inhibition of Wnt signaling by Tsukushi leads to the regulation of retinal and peripheral eye development (6Dellett M. Hu W. Papadaki V. Ohnuma S.

Like several other SLRPs, PRELP is known to bind to type I and II collagen fibrils via leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (16Bengtsson E. Mörgelin M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Heinegård D. Aspberg A.

PRELP also interacts with several proteins involved in the complement system including C4b-binding protein, C3, and C9. The interaction of PRELP with C9 blocks C9 polymerization, which inhibits formation of the complement membrane attack complex (19Happonen K.E. Fürst C.M. Saxne T. Heinegård D. Blom A.M.

Furthermore, it has been recently revealed that PRELP interacts with a growth factor, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), as with many other SLRPs, resulting in the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation (20Papadaki V. Asada K. Watson J.K. Tamura T. Leung A. Hopkins J. Dellett M. Sasaki N. Davaapil H. Nik-Zainal S. Longbottom R. Nakakido M. Torii R. Veerakumarasivam A.

Although PRELP-mediated inhibition of TGF-β pathway was previously reported (20Papadaki V. Asada K. Watson J.K. Tamura T. Leung A. Hopkins J. Dellett M. Sasaki N. Davaapil H. Nik-Zainal S. Longbottom R. Nakakido M. Torii R. Veerakumarasivam A.

Analysis of the ONCOMINE database showed that gene expression of PRELP is suppressed in many types of cancer (21Rhodes D.R. Yu J. Shanker K. Deshpande N. Varambally R. Ghosh D. Barrette T. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. ONCOMINE: A cancer Microarray database and Integrated data-Mining Platform.Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have indicated that PRELP has functions as a tumor-suppressing protein inhibiting the progression of bladder cancer (20Papadaki V. Asada K. Watson J.K. Tamura T. Leung A.

Gu J. Niu G. Hu Z. Zhang X. Song T. Han S. Hong L. Ke C. PRELP has prognostic value and regulates cell proliferation and migration in hepatocellular carcinoma.J. Cancer. 2020; 11: 6376-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It was also reported that in a mouse model the N-terminal peptide of human PRELP inhibits breast tumor cell growth and metastasis, contributing to a reduction in cachexia and increased survival (23Rucci N. Capulli M. Ventura L. Angelucci A. Peruzzi B. Tillgren V. Muraca M. Teti A. Proline/arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein N-terminus is a novel osteoclast antagonist that counteracts bone loss.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2013; 28: 1912-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PRELP is likely to be essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Given that other SLRPs regulate cellular functions through modulation of signaling pathways via interactions with membrane proteins, we hypothesized that PRELP also interacts with multiple membrane proteins and regulates signaling pathways. To address this hypothesis, we used a proteomic approach to identify membrane proteins that interact with PRELP. To identify novel membrane proteins that interact with PRELP, we used coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometric analysis (CoIP-MS). The protocol included use of an S-Trap column, which effectively removes detergents from samples. We identified various membrane proteins, including two growth factor receptors, IGFI-R and low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75NTR), as interacting partners. We validated that PRELP binds directly to the extracellular domains of these two receptors by analyses of recombinant proteins using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. In addition, we showed that the addition of micromolar concentration of recombinant PRELP to A549 lung carcinoma cells induced the suppression of cell growth and change of cell morphology. Our investigation furthers our understanding of PRELP functions at the molecular level. To identify the membrane proteins that interact with PRELP, we performed CoIP-MS. Human PRELP with a FLAG-tag was overexpressed in Expi293 cells, a human cell line in which proteins can be expressed at high levels. Membrane fractions from cells transfected with control vector and the PRELP expression vector were isolated by ultracentrifugation from sonicated cells. Membrane proteins were extracted using the detergent n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM). An antibody that recognizes the FLAG-tag of the expressed PRELP was used to capture PRELP and associated proteins. Subsequent MS analysis of eluted samples identified 1803 proteins (protein threshold: 99%; minimum number of unique peptides: 2; peptide threshold: 95%). All assigned peptides are listed in Table S1. Comparison of identified proteins in each sample showed that 1326 proteins were found in samples from both control and PRELP-expressing cells and that 401 different proteins were identified only in the PRELP-expressing cells sample (Fig. 1A and Table S2). In total, 76 proteins were found only in the control cells sample, for the expression of these proteins might be downregulated in the PRELP-expressing cells. To assess the localization of the proteins that appear to interact with PRELP, we used gene ontology (GO) analysis. A number of proteins that interact with PRELP localize in membrane fractions, although the analysis also suggested that a large portion of the proteins identified are localized intracellularly (Fig. 1B). Plasma membrane proteins, defined as proteins that have both extracellular domains and transmembrane domains spanning the plasma membrane, that interact with PRELP were identified by a search of the Uniprot database (24Apweiler R. UniProt: The Universal protein knowledgebase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D115-D119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

More recently, PRELP and osteomodulin, a most highly conserved SLRP member with PRELP, have been also found that they regulate bladder cancer initiation in a functionally partially redundant manner.

Therefore, we particularly focused on growth factor receptors coprecipitated with PRELP, which would be key proteins to explain molecular function of PRELP as tumor suppressor.

In addition, the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor known as p75NTR was detected. Although only one peptide fragment of p75NTR was assigned under the 80% of protein threshold and 95% of peptide threshold, the score of MS/MS spectra of this peptide was high, and this peptide sequence is unique to this protein (Fig. 2 and Table S3). To validate the interactions of PRELP with these two receptors, we carried out CoIP using the antibody that recognizes the FLAG-tag of the expressed PRELP followed by western blot analysis. Both IGFI-R and p75NTR were detected in CoIP-eluates of extracts of cells that express PRELP but not in control-transfected Expi293 cells (Fig. 3). Incidentally, two bands of western blot observed in PRELP and p75NTR are probably due to the heterogeneity of glycan modification. These experiments indicate that these two receptors specifically interact with PRELP.Figure 3Western blot analysis validates the interactions of PRELP with IGFI-R and p75NTR.

S . aureus is more prevalent among humans, whereas S . pseudintermedius is more commonly isolated from dogs, however, both can cause various community and hospital acquired diseases in humans. Methods In the current study we screened 102 dogs and 84 owners in Hungary. We tested the antibiotic susceptibility of the strains and in order to get a better picture of the clonal relationship of the strains, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition, three pairs of isolates with identical PFGE patterns were whole genome sequenced, MLST and spa types were established. Results Carriage rate of S . aureus was 23.8% in humans and 4.9% in dogs and two cases of co-carriage were found among dogs and owners. S . pseudintermedius carriage rate was 2.4% and 34.3%, respectively, with only one co-carriage. The isolates were generally rather susceptible to the tested antibiotics, but high tetracycline resistance of S . pseudintermedius strains was noted. The co-carried isolates shared almost the same resistance genes (including tet(K) , bla(Z) , norA , mepR , lmrS , fosB ) and virulence gene pattern. Apart from the common staphylococcal enzymes and cytotoxins, we found enterotoxins and exfoliative toxins as well. The two S . aureus pairs belonged to ST45-t630, ST45-t671 and ST15-t084, ST15-t084, respectively. The co-carried S . pseudintermedius isolates shared the same housekeeping gene alleles determining a novel sequence type ST1685. Conclusions Based on the genomic data, dog-owner co-carried strains displayed only insignificant differences therefore provided evidence for potential human-to-dog and dog-to-human transmission."

To study αS under the most relevant conditions by a quantitative method, we cultured and matured rodent primary cortical neurons for >17 days and determined αS cytosol:membrane distribution via centrifugation-free sequential extractions based on the weak ionic detergent digitonin. We noticed that at lower temperatures (4 °C or room temperature), αS was largely membrane-associated. At 37 °C, however, αS solubility was markedly increased. In contrast, the extraction of control proteins (GAPDH, cytosolic; calnexin, membrane) was not affected by temperature. When we compared the relative distribution of the synuclein homologs αS and β-synuclein (βS) under various conditions that differed in temperature and digitonin concentration (200–1200 μg/ml), we consistently found αS to be more membrane-associated than βS. Both proteins, however, exhibited temperature-dependent membrane binding. Under the most relevant conditions (37 °C and 800 μg/ml digitonin, i.e., the lowest digitonin concentration that extracted cytosolic GAPDH to near completion), cytosolic distribution was 49.8% ± 9.0% for αS and 63.6% ± 6.6% for βS. PD-linked αS A30P was found to be largely cytosolic, confirming previous studies that had used different methods.

The exact cytosol:membrane distribution of the synucleins in human neurons, however, remains unsettled, both in absolute and in relative terms. We have now developed a simple and reproducible method employing digitonin-based sequential extraction of first cytosolic and then membrane-associated proteins, which readily enables us to characterize the cytosol:membrane distribution of synuclein proteins under basal and experimental conditions. We reasoned that centrifugal force and detachment of neurons from culture dishes may lead to rupture of membrane and may eventually influence our assessment. Thus, we adapted an on-plate, centrifugation-free procedure. Using this method and employing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; largely cytosolic) and calnexin (transmembrane) as controls, we show that endogenous αS and βS in primary cortical neurons indeed seem to exist in an equilibrium of soluble and membrane-associated forms. αS was found to be more strongly membrane-associated than βS, while both synucleins exhibit a pronounced temperature dependence of their membrane interactions: body temperature promotes cytosolic localization up to 50% (αS) or >60% (βS), lower temperatures are associated with predominant membrane association of the synuclein proteins. Human wild-type (wt) αS expressed in rat neurons behaved similarly to the endogenous protein while familial-PD (fPD)-linked αS A30P was found to be largely cytosolic, in line with previous studies that had used orthogonal methods (27Jo E. Fuller N. Rand R.P. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Defective membrane interactions of familial Parkinson’s disease mutant A30P alpha-synuclein.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). αS has been demonstrated to exhibit several aspects of dynamic behavior in its natural cellular environment, as reviewed recently by Yeboah et al. (28Yeboah F. Kim T.-E. Bill A. Dettmer U. Dynamic behaviors of α-synuclein and tau in the cellular context: New mechanistic insights and therapeutic opportunities in neurodegeneration.Neurobiol. Dis. 2019; 132: 104543Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present work, we sought to study the extent of αS-membrane interaction in a minimally disruptive way. As a model system we chose primary cortical rat neurons because they i) are rich in αS, ii) are easy to culture, iii) are readily available in large amounts for extensive optimization experiments, and iv) possess mature synapses after ∼14 days of culture (29Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Synucleins are developmentally expressed, and alpha-synuclein regulates the size of the presynaptic vesicular pool in primary hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess αS cytosol:membrane distribution in situ, i.e., without lifting cells off the culture dishes, we turned to digitonin-based sequential extraction of cellular proteins. Previous work from the Edwards lab had taken advantage of the same principle: to study only membrane-associated αS by fluorescence microscopy, the authors removed cytosolic αS by permeabilizing αS-expressing HeLa cells with digitonin before fixation (11Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. Lipid rafts mediate the synaptic localization of alpha-synuclein.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that digitonin at low concentrations selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane, thereby releasing soluble, cytoplasmic proteins (30Schulz I. Permeabilizing cells: Some methods and applications for the study of intracellular processes.in: Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, NY1955: 280-300Google Scholar). We decided to pursue a two-step biochemical sequential extraction strategy. In the first step, we extracted the soluble proteins (“cytosol”) by gently permeabilizing the plasma membrane, but not internal membranes such as endoplasmic reticulum or vesicle membranes. To achieve optimal stringency, we employed a wide range of digitonin concentrations (200–1200 μg/ml) and tested them under three different temperatures: 4 °C, room temperature (RT), and 37 °C (Fig. 1). The resulting cytosolic lysates were collected. In the second step, we incubated the cells in a buffer containing 0.5% of the detergent Triton-X-100, thereby largely extracting membrane proteins (“membrane”). The resulting membrane lysates were collected. Next, cytosolic and membrane lysates were analyzed by western blotting. To confirm the identity of the fractions, we employed the transmembrane control protein calnexin as well as GAPDH, which is widely used as a cytosolic marker (e.g., Fig. 2A in ref. (31Liu X. Fagotto F. A method to separate nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane-associated signaling molecules in cultured cells.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: pl2Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Under all conditions tested, calnexin was detected exclusively in the membrane fractions, as expected (Fig. 1, A–C and bottom panels in Fig. 1, G–I). In contrast, GAPDH was not solely detected in cytosolic fractions: at lower digitonin concentrations (200, 400, 600 μg/ml), relevant amounts were found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1, A–C, and third panel from the top in Fig. 1, G–I). This either indicated incomplete extraction or could be explained by reports on GAPDH functions beyond its role as a cytosolic glycolytic enzyme (reviewed in ref. (32Tristan C. Shahani N. Sedlak T.W. Sawa A. The diverse functions of GAPDH: Views from different subcellular compartments.Cell Signal. 2011; 23: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar)). However, at 800 μg/ml and above, GAPDH was extracted to near completion, and the remaining contaminations in the membrane fraction appeared negligible for our purpose (it should be noted that in the first extraction step, cytosolic proteins will be highly enriched in the large extracellular volume, but a portion will also remain present in the small intracellular volume). Another glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 behaved similarly to GAPDH (not shown). Importantly, the calnexin and GAPDH extraction patterns did not obviously differ between different temperatures (Fig. 1, A–C). For αS, in contrast, we observed pronounced temperature-dependent effects: at 4 °C and RT, αS was largely detected in membrane fractions; even at high digitonin concentrations (800–1200 μg/ml), less than 20% of αS was cytosolic (Fig. 1, D and E and first panels from the top in Fig. 1, G and H). At 37 °C, however, a shift from membrane to cytosolic fractions was observed, and αS solubility increased to up to 50% (Fig. 1F and first panel from the top in Fig. 1I). We next compared the relative solubility of the two synuclein homologs that are prevalent in brain neurons, αS and βS (the third homolog, γS, exhibits a different tissue distribution). Unlike αS, βS has not been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurologic disorders. Similar to the extraction of αS, we found βS cytosol:membrane distribution to be temperature-dependent: at 4 °C, 20 to 40% of βS was extracted at low (200–600 μg/ml) and 50 to 60% at high (800–1200 μg/ml) digitonin concentrations (Fig. 1D and second panel from top in Fig. 1G). These numbers were only slightly higher at RT (Fig. 1, E and H). At 37 °C, however, we extracted 30 to 60% of βS at low (200–600 μg/ml) and 60 to 70% at high (800–1200 μg/ml) digitonin concentrations (Fig. 1, F and I). Thus, βS solubility was significantly higher than αS solubility under all conditions tested, as quantified in Figure 1, D–F. Employing what we considered the most relevant conditions (37 °C and 800–900 μg/ml digitonin, i.e., the lowest digitonin concentrations that extracted GAPDH to near completion), we then tested the relative cytosol:membrane distribution of human αS wt and fPD-linked αS A30P. Transduced cultured rat cortical neurons were subjected to sequential extraction and immunoblotting using a human-specific antibody. Consistent with published reports that had used orthogonal methods (27Jo E. Fuller N. Rand R.P. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Defective membrane interactions of familial Parkinson’s disease mutant A30P alpha-synuclein.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), human αS A30P was observed to be largely cytosolic (cytosolic distribution: 90.4% ± 1.5%), exhibiting a distribution pattern similar to GAPDH (Fig. 2, A–C). Human wt αS, in contrast, partitioned 49.4% ± 5.2 between cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig. 2, A and C), similar to endogenous rat αS (Fig. 1). Here, we systematically developed a stringent in situ sequential extraction method to study the cytosol:membrane distribution of synuclein proteins in primary rat cortical neurons. We employed a two-step approach: in a first step, we selectively permeabilized the plasma membrane using the mild detergent digitonin at various concentrations (200–1200 μg/ml) to extract cytosolic proteins. In a second step, we solubilized the more strongly membrane-associated proteins using the detergent Triton-X-100 at 0.5%. Cytosol (GAPDH) and membrane control proteins (calnexin) confirmed the validity of our approach. The results that we obtained for αS and βS are consistent with the notion that those proteins transiently/imperfectly interact with (vesicular) membranes (33Maroteaux L. Scheller R.H. The rat brain synucleins; family of proteins transiently associated with neuronal membrane.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). When establishing our method, we found that αS and βS cytosol:membrane distribution strongly depends on temperature. At 4 °C and even at RT, αS, but also the homolog βS, was largely membrane-associated. Only at body temperature (37 °C) 50% or more of the synuclein proteins were recovered in the cytosolic fraction that was characterized by the presence of the soluble enzyme GAPDH and absence of the transmembrane protein calnexin. This observation once again highlighted the dynamic nature of cellular synuclein proteostasis: a temperature difference of only ∼12 °C (RT versus 37 °C) appears to have major consequences on cellular αS localization (and, related to that, folding). The implications on the design of biochemical and cell-biological studies of synuclein proteins are obvious: synuclein homeostasis is best studied at 37 °C while lower temperatures should be avoided, even for short periods of time. This means that standard protocols may have to be modified in the case of synuclein. For example, it is common to perform cell lysis on ice, which may lead to artifacts when αS is studied. Our data do not permit a definite statement on the exact cytosol:membrane distribution of αS and βS in cultured neurons. There has been some debate about the lifetime of the membrane-bound αS state, and the reported numbers range from millisecond for purified recombinant αS in reductionist systems (34Viennet T. Wördehoff M.M. Uluca B. Poojari C. Shaykhalishahi H. Willbold D. Strodel B. Heise H. Buell A.K. Hoyer W. Etzkorn M. Structural insights from lipid-bilayer nanodiscs link α-synuclein membrane-binding modes to amyloid fibril formation.Commun. Biol. 2018; 1: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to seconds or even minutes in cultured cells or animals (35Fortin D.L. Nemani V.M. Voglmaier S.M. Anthony M.D. Ryan T.A. Edwards R.H. Neural activity controls the synaptic accumulation of alpha-synuclein.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10913-10921Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 36Unni V.K. Weissman T.A. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. McLean P.J. Hyman B.T. In vivo imaging of α-synuclein in mouse cortex demonstrates stable expression and differential subcellular compartment mobility.PLoS One. 2010; 5e10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37van Ham T.J. Thijssen K.L. Breitling R. Hofstra R.M.W. Plasterk R.H.A. Nollen E.A.A. C. elegans model identifies genetic modifiers of alpha-synuclein inclusion formation during aging.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4e1000027Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). All these values, however, are below the duration of our first extraction step that recovers cytosol-enriched proteins within the timeframe of 15 min. αS partitioning is not expected to be “static” during the extraction, and the fact that the plasma membrane becomes “leaky” and additional, extracellular volume becomes available for soluble proteins may increase the observed fraction in the soluble phase (see “Nernst’s distribution law”). Consequently, our approach is more likely to detect false-positive cytosolic αS than false-positive membrane-associated αS. Out of the conditions that we have tested, it appears plausible to identify 37 °C and 800 μg/ml digitonin (the lowest digitonin concentration that extracted GAPDH to near completion) as most relevant and most likely to be close to physiology. Under these conditions, cytosolic distribution was 49.8% ± 9.0% for αS and 63.6% ± 6.6% for βS. These values are largely in agreement with the literature on synuclein as a transiently membrane-associated protein, as reviewed by Yeboah et al. (28Yeboah F. Kim T.-E. Bill A. Dettmer U. Dynamic behaviors of α-synuclein and tau in the cellular context: New mechanistic insights and therapeutic opportunities in neurodegeneration.Neurobiol. Dis. 2019; 132: 104543Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The relative distribution of αS and βS, i.e., increased solubility of βS relative to αS, was a highly consistent finding throughout all conditions tested and, thus, is very likely to reflect the underlying biology. Along those lines, we characterized human αS A30P in Figure 2 as an abundantly cytosolic protein (cytosolic distribution: 90.4% ± 1.5%), while human αS wt behaved like a protein that populates both cytosolic and membrane-associated states to a largely similar extent (cytosolic distribution: 49.4% ± 5.2), similar to the endogenous rat protein (Fig. 1). The enhanced membrane association of αS relative to βS may explain certain aspects of αS pathogenicity. Indeed, Volles et al. (38Volles M.J. Lansbury P.T. Relationships between the sequence of alpha-synuclein and its membrane affinity, fibrillization propensity, and yeast toxicity.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have reported, based on studying purified αS and αS-expressing yeast, that αS toxicity is directly linked to its membrane affinity, instead of its aggregation propensity. In the same study, the authors demonstrated that βS is more soluble and less toxic than αS (38Volles M.J. Lansbury P.T. Relationships between the sequence of alpha-synuclein and its membrane affinity, fibrillization propensity, and yeast toxicity.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our work, performed in cultured rodent neurons in situ, is consistent with this notion, supporting hypotheses of increased αS membrane association being a driver of its relative toxicity (38Volles M.J. Lansbury P.T. Relationships between the sequence of alpha-synuclein and its membrane affinity, fibrillization propensity, and yeast toxicity.J. Mol.

Increased membrane interaction of the PD-linked αS relative to the non-disease-relevant βS adds validity to therapeutic approaches aimed at reducing αS membrane interaction, such as SCD inhibition (40Fanning S.

A. 2019; 116: 20760-20769Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It should not be ignored, however, that not all of the PD-linked αS missense mutations increase membrane interaction; at least A30P has been reported to reduce it (27Jo E. Fuller N. Rand R.P. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Defective membrane interactions of familial Parkinson’s disease mutant A30P alpha-synuclein.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and our own data confirm this notion (Fig. 2). A simple model in which αS membrane interaction is either entirely “good” or entirely “bad” would not be consistent with the literature that has highlighted both excess membrane interaction (15Dettmer U.

Neurosci. 2015; 35: 5221-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as potential starting points of αS-related pathology. Our new, stringent approach to biochemically testing synuclein membrane interactions in cultured neurons with minimal perturbation of the system promises to shed light on the role of transient membrane binding on the pathobiology of αS point mutations as well as the effects of genetic and environmental factors on αS homeostasis. Membrane interactions of αS are expected to be upstream of its proteinaceous aggregation. Thus, our work has important implications for assessing the ability of novel therapeutic strategies to maintain or reestablish normal αS cytosol:membrane interactions as a key aspect of αS proteostasis. αS-wild-type or A30P lentiviral plasmids were generated as follows: first, the EF1α promoter sequence in pLVX-EF1α-IRES-mCherry (from TaKaRa) was replaced by human synapsin promoter, and then mCherry coding sequence was removed. The resultant parental plasmid (pLVX-SPΔ) was used to clone synthetic cDNA sequence coding for human αS wild-type or A30P variant into SpeI/NotI restriction sites. The expression of transgene is driven by human synapsin promoter. 293-T cells were transfected with αS wt or A30P plasmids along with pMD2.G and psPAX2 (packaging plasmids: Addgene #12259 and #12260, respectively). Culture supernatant containing viral particles was further purified/concentrated by ultracentrifugation. As primary antibodies we used mAb Syn1 to detect rat endogenous αS (Becton-Dickinson), mAb MJFR1 to detect only human αS (Abcam), mAb EP1537Y to βS (Abcam), mAb 6C5 to GAPDH (Santa Cruz), and pAb C4731 to Calnexin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit Fluorescent LiCor IRDye 800CW and anti-mouse Fluorescent LiCor IRDye 700DX. Primary neurons were cultured from E18 Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Rats were euthanized with CO2 followed by bilateral thoracotomy. Embryonic cortices were isolated and dissociated with trypsin/EDTA and trituration. 250,000 cells were plated on poly-D-lysine coated 24-well plates and cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27, 2 mM GlutaMAX. Half of the medium was replaced every 4 days. For lentiviral transduction, DIV9 neurons were transduced with αS wt or A30P virus at MOI 5. Institutional animal work protocols were followed. DIV18–DIV21 neurons were used throughout. The on-plate sequential extraction of cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins was carried out as follows in 24-well plates: 1) neurons were rinsed once with HBSS. 2) In total, 125 μl of buffer “cytosol” (10 mM PIPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA) supplemented with the respective concentration of digitonin (D141, Sigma) and protease inhibitors was added to the wells. Note: 50 mg/ml digitonin stock was prepared freshly. 3) The plates were incubated at the respective temperature undisturbed for 15 min. The resultant cytosolic protein fraction was carefully collected into a 1.5 ml tube. 4) Subsequently, 125 μl buffer “membrane” (10 mM PIPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton-X-100 and protease inhibitors) was added to the wells and incubated for 15 min at the respective temperature. 5) The resultant membrane fraction was carefully collected into a 1.5 ml tube. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by dilution with the respective lysis buffer, addition of 4X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer supplemented with 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol, and boiling for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on NuPAGE 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gels with NuPAGE MES-SDS running buffer and SeeBlue Plus2 molecular weight marker (all by Invitrogen) at 140 V and transferred in the iBlot 2 system (Invitrogen) to nitrocellulose membranes (iBlot 2 NC regular stacks; IB23001). Membranes were fixed for 10 min in 0.4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (5% milk in TBST) for 1 h and incubated in primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed 5 × 5 min in TBST. Secondary antibodies were prepared in the blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at RT. Membranes were washed 5 × 5 min in TBST and scanned (Odyssey CLx, Li-Cor). We performed paired t-test or two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism Version 8 following the program’s guidelines. Normal distribution and equal variance were observed for all values. Graphs include ± SD. Criteria for significance were: ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.

https://openalex.org/W3118701059,"Patients with locally/regionally advanced melanoma were treated with neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy with high-dose interferon α-2b (HDI) and ipilimumab in a phase I clinical trial. Tumor specimens were obtained prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy, at the time of surgery and progression if available. In this study, gene expression profiles of tumor specimens (N = 27) were investigated using the NanoString nCounter® platform to evaluate associations with clinical outcomes (pathologic response, radiologic response, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS)) and define biomarkers associated with tumor response. The Tumor Inflammation Signature (TIS), an 18-gene signature that enriches for response to Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade, was also evaluated for association with clinical response and survival. It was observed that neoadjuvant ipilimumab-HDI therapy demonstrated an upregulation of immune-related genes, chemokines, and transcription regulator genes involved in immune cell activation, function, or cell proliferation. Importantly, increased expression of baseline pro-inflammatory genes CCL19 , CD3D , CD8A , CD22 , LY9 , IL12RB1 , C1S , C7 , AMICA1 , TIAM1 , TIGIT , THY1 was associated with longer OS ( p &lt; 0.05). In addition, multiple genes that encode a component or a regulator of the extracellular matrix such as MMP2 and COL1A2 were identified post-treatment as being associated with longer RFS and OS. In all baseline tissues, high TIS scores were associated with longer OS ( p = 0.0166). Also, downregulated expression of cell proliferation-related genes such as CUL1 , CCND1 and AAMP at baseline was associated with pathological and radiological response (unadjusted p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, we identified numerous genes that play roles in multiple biological pathways involved in immune activation, immune suppression and cell proliferation correlating with pathological/radiological responses following neoadjuvant immunotherapy highlighting the complexity of immune responses modulated by immunotherapy. Our observations suggest that TIS may be a useful biomarker for predicting survival outcomes with combination immunotherapy."

In this study, we compared the ontogeny of digestive tract morphology and enzyme activities (pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, alkaline phosphatase and aminopeptidase) of diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon. Fish were fed diets based on fishmeal (STD) or a mix of fishmeal and hydrolysed fish proteins (HFM) whilst being reared at low temperature from start-feeding to completion of the parr-smolt transformation. Fish weights for each ploidy and feed combination were used to calculate thermal growth coefficients (TGCs) that spanned this developmental period, and the data were used to examine possible relationships between enzyme activities and growth. At the end of the experiment, faeces were collected and analyzed to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of the dietary amino acids (AAs). Digestive tract histo-morphology did not differ substantially between ploidies and generally reflected organ maturation and functionality. There were no consistent differences in proteolytic enzyme activities resulting from the inclusion of HFM in the diet, nor was there improved digestibility and AA bioavailability of the HFM feed in either diploid or triploid fish. The triploid salmon had lower ADCs than diploids for most essential and non-essential AAs in both diets (STD and HFM), but without there being any indication of lower intestinal protease activity in triploid fish. When trypsin-to-chymotrypsin activity and trypsin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ratios (T:C and T:ALP, respectively) were considered in combination with growth data (TGC) low T:C and T:ALP values coincided with times of reduced fish growth, and vice versa, suggesting that T:C and T:ALP may be used to predict recent growth history and possible growth potential."

A split-plot design was utilized to assess the motility of the two pre-spermatophore sample types at two temperatures, 0°C and 20°C (n = 10 for each treatment). Spermiation was induced through exogenous hormone treatment of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog in order to collect both milt and spermic urine, which were evaluated for motility, divided into two separate aliquots, and subsequently stored in either an ice-bath (0°C) or on the benchtop (20°C). The decay rate of sperm motility was assessed by reevaluating subsamples at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 24 hours following the initial assessment. Results showed that sperm stored at 0°C had significantly higher progressive, non-progressive, and total motility for both sperm collection types over time. An interaction was found between collection type and time, with milt exhibiting lower initial motility that was more sustainable over time, compared to spermic urine. For both milt and spermic urine, motility decreased rapidly with storage duration, indicating samples should be used as soon as possible to maximize motility for in-vitro fertilization and cryopreservation. This is the first study to describe the differences in sperm motility between milt and spermic urine from an internally fertilizing caudate and demonstrates the benefits of near freezing temperatures on sperm longevity."

Methods This study was a prospective randomized double-masked clinical trial conducted by Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital between April 04, 2019, and November 31, 2019. Sixty-two participants were recruited, and 12 of them were not enrolled because they had undergone previous treatments for ocular surface diseases. The participants were adult patients with cataract, exhibiting normal lid position; they did not present any other ocular disease and did not meet the exclusion criteria of the clinical trial. Fifty subjects were enrolled in the study. The randomized subjects received treatment with 0.05% CsA (group A) or 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (group B) over the 3 months following the cataract surgery. Subjective and objective assessments were performed at preoperative and postoperative visits. Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), tear breakup time (TBUT), and Schirmer’s I test were performed by the same surgeon, and LLT and meiboscore were determined using the LipiView ® interferometer. Results Fifty subjects subjects enrolled consisted of men (50%) and women (50%), with a mean (SD) age of 65.94 (10.35) years. Four subjects in group A and five in group B were excluded from the analysis as they were lost to follow-up within 1 month after cataract surgery. Thus, the study comprised 41 eyes of 41 subjects; 21 subjects were treated with CsA and 20 subjects with CMC. Comparing the clinical measurements between groups A and B taken at the last visit, while controlling the effects of the preoperative values, TBUT and LLT showed significant differences ( p = 0.035 and p = 0.047, respectively, by ANCOVA). The TBUT between the subjects using CsA and those using CMC after cataract surgery showed a significant difference during follow up ( p = 0.003 by repeated measures ANOVA). In the multivariate analysis, preoperative LLT and the use of CsA were found to be independent parameters for postoperative LLT (R 2 = 0.303; p = 0.008 and p = 0.045, respectively), whereas the follow-up duration exhibited a positive correlation with the difference between the preoperative and postoperative values of LLT in the group treated with CsA (R 2 = 0.738 and p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Treatment with 0.05% CsA following cataract surgery is effective in improving TBUT and LLT in comparison with 0.5% CMC. A higher preoperative value of LLT and the postoperative use of CsA could be significant determinants of a higher postoperative LLT value. Trial registration ISRCTN registry with ISRCTN 10173448 ."
https://openalex.org/W2992551073,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for almost all of the 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer and approximately 311,000 deaths per year. HPV vaccination is an integral component of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global strategy to fight the disease. However, high vaccine prices enforced through patent protection are limiting vaccine expansion, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. By limiting market power, patent buyouts could reduce vaccine prices and raise HPV vaccination rates while keeping innovation incentives. We estimate the global patent buyout price as the present discounted value (PDV) of the future profit stream over the remaining patent length for Merck’s HPV vaccines (Gardasil-4 and 9), which hold 87% of the global HPV vaccine market, in the range of US$ 15.6–27.7 billion (in 2018 US$). The estimated PDV of the profit stream since market introduction amounts to US$ 17.8–42.8 billion and the estimated R&amp;D cost to US$ 1.05–1.21 billion. Thus, we arrive at a ratio of R&amp;D costs to the patent value of the order of 2.5–6.8%. We relate this figure to typical estimates of the probability of success (POS) for clinical trials of vaccines to discuss if patent protection provides Merck with extraordinarily strong price setting power."
https://openalex.org/W3119337937,"Alternative models for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) are typically assessed using traditional error metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE), which may not be sufficient to select the best model for irrigation scheduling purposes. Thus, this study analyzes the performance of the original and calibrated Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Romanenko (ROM) and Jensen-Haise (JH) equations, initially assessed using traditional error metrics, for use in irrigation scheduling, considering the simulation of different irrigation intervals/time scales. Irrigation scheduling was simulated using meteorological data collected in Viçosa-MG and Mocambinho-MG, Brazil. The Penman-Monteith FAO-56 equation was used as benchmark. In general, the original equations did not perform well to estimate ETo, except the ROM and HS equations used at Viçosa and Mocambinho, respectively. Calibration and the increase in the time scale provided performance gains. When applied in irrigation scheduling, the calibrated HS and JH equations showed the best performances. Even with greater errors in estimating ETo, the calibrated HS equation performed similarly or better than the calibrated JH equation, as it had errors with greater potential to be canceled during the soil water balance. Finally, in addition to using error metrics, the performance of the models throughout the year should be considered in their assessment. Furthermore, simulating the application of ETo models in irrigation scheduling can provide valuable information for choosing the most suitable model."
https://openalex.org/W3120618700,"Introduction Interleukin-34 (IL-34) shares a receptor (cFMS) with colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), and these two ligands mediate macrophage proliferation. However, in contrast to CSF-1, the influence of IL-34 on tubular epithelial cells (TECs) injury remains unclear. We investigated the physiological effects of IL-34 on TEC damage caused by cisplatin nephrotoxicity (CP-N). Methods Mice were administered anti-mouse IL-34 antibody (anti-IL-34 Ab; 400 ng/kg) or vehicle from 1 day before and up to 2 days after CP-N induction. In vitro , mouse renal proximal TECs (MRPTEpiC) were cultured to analyze the inhibitory effects of IL-34 on CP-induced TEC apoptosis. Results Compared to vehicle treatment, anti-IL-34 Ab treatment significantly suppressed the intra-renal expression of IL-34 and its two receptors, cFMS and PTP-ζ, and significantly improved renal function, ameliorated tubulointerstitial injury, suppressed macrophage infiltration, and reduced apoptotic cell numbers in CP-N mice. It also significantly reduced the renal transcript levels of Kim-1, MIP-1/CCL3, TNF-α, and Bax in CP-N mice. Furthermore, anti-IL-34 Ab-treated CP-N mice showed less renal infiltration of F4/80 + TNF-α + cells. In vitro , stimulation with CP induced the expression of IL-34 and its two receptors in MRPTEpiC. Anti-IL-34 Ab treatment significantly suppressed CP-induced Bax expression with the degradation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in damaged MRPTEpiC. Conclusions IL-34 secreted from damaged TECs appeared to be involved in the progression of CP-N. Inhibition of IL-34 with neutralizing antibody directly prevented CP-induced TEC apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2. Blocking of IL-34 appears to suppress the proliferation of cytotoxic macrophages, which indirectly attenuates CP-N. Thus, IL-34 represents a potential therapeutic target for TEC injury, and the inhibition of IL-34 might have a reno-protective effect."

https://openalex.org/W3119721891,"Background and objectives Research on Legionnaires’ Disease (LD) suggests there may be long-term health complications, but data are limited. This study investigated whether Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission during LD hospitalization may be associated with adverse health outcomes and characterized subsequent discharge diagnoses in patients with LD up to 5 years post-LD. Methods We conducted a retrospective case series study with follow up for 5 years among patients hospitalized at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center between 2005 and 2010 with LD. Data were collected from medical records on health history, LD severity (including ICU admission), and discharge diagnoses for 5 years post-LD or until death. We used ordinal logistic regression to explore associations between ICU admission and hospitalizations post-LD. Frequency counts were used to determine the most prevalent discharge diagnoses in the 5 years post-LD. Results For the 292 patients with laboratory-confirmed LD, those admitted to the ICU during LD hospitalization were more likely to have a greater number of hospitalizations within 5 years compared to non-ICU patients (OR Hosp 1.92 CI 95% 1.25, 2.95). Fifty-five percent (161/292) had ≥ 1 hospitalization within 5 years post-LD. After accounting for pre-existing diagnosis codes in patients with at least one hospitalization in the 2 years prior to LD (n = 77/161 patients, 47.8%), three of the four most frequent new diagnoses in the 5 years post-LD were non-chronic conditions: acute renal failure (n = 22, 28.6%), acute respiratory failure (n = 17, 22.1%) and unspecified pneumonia (n = 15, 19.5%). Conclusions Our findings indicate that LD requiring ICU admission is associated with more subsequent hospitalizations, a factor that could contribute to poorer future health for people with severe LD. In addition to chronic conditions prevalent in this study population, we found new diagnoses in the 5-year post-LD period including acute renal failure. With LD incidence increasing, more research is needed to understand conditions and factors that influence long term health after LD."
https://openalex.org/W3120465469,"Diabetes mellitus is caused by breakdown of blood glucose homeostasis, which is maintained by an exquisite balance between insulin and glucagon produced respectively by pancreatic beta cells and alpha cells. However, little is known about the mechanism of inducing glucagon secretion from human alpha cells. Many methods for generating pancreatic beta cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been reported, but only two papers have reported generation of pancreatic alpha cells from hPSCs. Because NKX6.1 has been suggested as a very important gene for determining cell fate between pancreatic beta and alpha cells, we searched for the factors affecting expression of NKX6.1 in our beta cell differentiation protocols. We found that BMP antagonism and activation of retinoic acid signaling at stage 2 (from definitive endoderm to primitive gut tube) effectively suppressed NKX6.1 expression at later stages. Using two different hPSCs lines, treatment with BMP signaling inhibitor (LDN193189) and retinoic acid agonist (EC23) at Stage 2 reduced NKX6.1 expression and allowed differentiation of almost all cells into pancreatic alpha cells in vivo after transplantation under a kidney capsule. Our study demonstrated that the cell fate of pancreatic cells can be controlled by adjusting the expression level of NKX6.1 with proper timing of BMP antagonism and activation of retinoic acid signaling during the pancreatic differentiation process. Our method is useful for efficient induction of pancreatic alpha cells from hPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3120812569,"Objectives Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most common poisoning substances, which causes mortality and morbidity worldwide. Delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS) have been reported to occur from several days to months after exposure to CO. Thus, there is a need for prevention, recognition, and treatment of DNS. Patients with CO poisoning as a component of intentional suicide often also consume ethanol, but there is debate regarding its role in DNS. We explored whether ethanol has a neuroprotective effect in CO poisoning. Methods This prospective observational study included patients who visited the emergency department from August 2016 to August 2019 due to CO poisoning. After treatment of acute CO poisoning, patients were interviewed by telephone to ascertain whether DNS had occurred within 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months from the time of CO exposure. Results During the study period, 171 patients were enrolled. 28 patients (16.37%) developed DNS. The initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were 15 (10.5–15) for the non-DNS group and 10 (7–15) for the DNS group (p = 0.002). The ethanol levels were 11.01 ± 17.58 mg/dL and 1.49 ± 2.63 mg/dL for each group (p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the GCS score had an odds ratio of 0.770 (p &lt; 0.001) and the ethanol level had 0.882 (p &lt; 0.030) for onset of DNS. Conclusions Higher ethanol level and higher initial GCS score were associated with lower incidence of DNS. Ethanol could have a neuroprotective effect on the occurrence of DNS in CO poisoning patients."

ELK-1 is subject to multiple levels of posttranslational control, including phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination.

In multicellular organisms, the importance of restricting cell proliferation is such that mitogen-responsive transcription factors are subject to multiple levels of control. For example, the ETS transcription factor ELK-1 is phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in response to growth factor signaling and transiently activated to initiate a gene expression program for cell cycle onset and proliferation (1Gille H.

Conversely, ELK-1 binding has also been correlated with polycomb repressor complexes in chromatin (6Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. SUMO promotes HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression.Mol.

Furthermore, ELK-1 can compete with myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) for binding to SRF at muscle-specific gene promoters (8Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A.

Notably, in amphibian and primitive chordate embryos, inactivation of the gene for ELK-1 is associated with defects that include the precocious appearance of mesoderm, suggesting that ELK-1 participates in the suppression of mesoderm formation (11Nentwich O. Dingwell K.S. Nordheim A. Smith J.C. Downstream of FGF during mesoderm formation in Xenopus: the roles of Elk-1 and Egr-1.Dev.

Thus ELK-1 contributes to the coordination of cell proliferation with tissue specification and serves as a paradigm for mitogen-responsive transcription factors. Understanding how ELK-1 is regulated is therefore an important goal in cancer and developmental biology. Aside from phosphorylation, other signaling axes that impinge on ELK-1 within the ERK/ELK-1/SRF regulatory nexus are SUMOylation, which represses ELK-1 transcriptional activity (6Yang S.H.

Dimer formation and conformational flexibility ensure cytoplasmic stability and nuclear accumulation of Elk-1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6390-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, ELK-1 is reversibly monoubiquitinated, which interferes with its activity, and the cell cycle regulated ubiquitin-specific protease USP17 is able to deubiquitinate and reactivate ELK-1 (14Ducker C. Chow L.K.Y. Saxton J. Handwerger J. McGregor A. Strahl T. Layfield R. Shaw P.E.

Depletion of USP17 slowed cell proliferation but expression of an ELK-1 mutant refractory to monoubiquitination partially rescued the proliferation defect. USP17 knockdown also caused heterogeneous differentiation of murine ES cells (17van der Laan S. Tsanov N. Crozet C. Maiorano D. High Dub3 expression in mouse ESCs couples the G1/S checkpoint to pluripotency.Mol. Cell. 2013; 52: 366-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, reversible ELK-1 monoubiquitination may play a pivotal role in coordinating cell proliferation during early development, and it follows that the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for monoubiquitination of ELK-1 is central to this regulatory mechanism. FBXO25 is one of a number of F-box proteins that serve as substrate recognition subunits for SKP1/Cullin1/F-box protein (SCF) complexes, a subfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases (18Skaar J.R. Pagan J.K. Pagano M. Mechanisms and function of substrate recruitment by F-box proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It is closely related to Atrogin-1/FBXO32, an E3 ligase expressed in striated muscle and associated with muscle atrophy (19Bodine S.C. Baehr L.M. Skeletal muscle atrophy and the E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 307: E469-E484Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Whereas FBXO32 expression is muscle-specific, FBXO25 is expressed in neuronal cells and the human FBXO25 gene is disrupted in a patient with intellectual disability and epileptic seizures (20Hagens O.

We therefore examined whether FBXO25 could also catalyze the monoubiquitination of ELK-1 and thereby operate in opposition to USP17. Although we confirmed that FBXO25 can interact with ELK-1 in cells, an antagonistic relationship between FBXO25 and USP17 toward ELK-1 was not apparent. Indeed, although FBXO25 activity was confirmed with two other candidate substrates, we were unable to detect ubiquitination of ELK-1 or modulation of its function by FBXO25, as previously reported (22Teixeira F.R. Manfiolli A.O. Soares C.S. Baqui M.M. Koide T. Gomes M.D. The F-box protein FBXO25 promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of ELK-1 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 28152-28162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). ELK-1 is a substrate for both mono- and polyubiquitination, and we recently showed that USP17 removes monoubiquitin (mUBQ) from ELK-1 (13Evans E.L. Saxton J. Shelton S.J. Begitt A. Holliday N.D.

To determine if FBXO25 catalyzed monoubiquitination of ELK-1, we used immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) to isolate his-tagged UBQ-ELK-1 conjugates from denatured HEK293T cell lysates. However, ectopic expression of V5-tagged FBXO25 (without His-tag) had no more effect on levels of monoubiquitinated ELK-1 (ELK-mUBQ) than the C terminus of HSP70 interacting protein (CHIP), which we used as a negative control [Fig. 2A]. Moreover, ubiquitination assays also revealed no effect of FBXO25 (or CHIP) expression on levels of polyubiquitinated ELK-1 (ELK-pUBQ) [Fig. 2B]. Since cell lysis and IMAC were performed under denaturing conditions, associations between ELK-1 and noncovalently bound pUBQ chains are ruled out. Ectopic expression of FBXO25 in HEK293T cells was reported to reduce steady-state levels of ELK-1 and to increase the rate of ELK-1 turnover (22Teixeira F.R. Manfiolli A.O. Soares C.S. Baqui M.M. Koide T. Gomes M.D. The F-box protein FBXO25 promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of ELK-1 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 28152-28162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, we observed that steady-state levels of endogenous or ectopically expressed ELK-1 were unaffected by FBXO25 expression [Fig. 2C]. Furthermore, cycloheximide chase experiments suggested that FBXO25 expression only marginally affected the half-life of ELK-1 [Fig. 2D]. We considered the possibility that the V5 epitope on the C terminus of FBXO25 might interfere with its activity toward ELK-1. We therefore produced N-terminal Myc-tagged versions, corresponding to FBXO25 mRNA variants 1 and 2 (NM_183421 and NM_183420), as well as a mutant version lacking the F-box domain (amino acids 228–266; ΔF) that cannot interact with SKP1 or other components of the SCF1 complex. Consistent with the results obtained using FBXO25-V5, no increase in ELK-pUBQ was observed upon coexpression of Myc-FBXO25 in HEK293T cells, with or without treatment with MG132 [Fig. 3, A–B]. To confirm the functional integrity of ectopically expressed FBXO25, we turned to other potential client proteins. FBXO25 was reported to ubiquitinate several cardiac-specific transcription factors including Hand1, a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein (23Jang J.W. Lee W.Y. Lee J.H. Moon S.H. Kim C.H. Chung H.M. A novel Fbxo25 acts as an E3 ligase for destructing cardiac specific transcription factors.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 410: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Myc-FBXO25 expression significantly increased levels of polyubiquitinated Hand1 in HEK293T cells [Fig. 3, C–D]. We also assessed the activity of FBXO25 in HeLa cells and found that its expression increased levels of polyubiquitinated Hand1 but did not promote polyubiquitination of ELK-1 [Fig. 3E] (see also Supplementary Information). Diglycine remnant mapping of UBQ-Hand1 conjugates from HEK293T cells using protein mass spectrometry confirmed ubiquitination of Hand1 on lysine 163, which maps C terminal to the bHLH domain [Fig. 3F] (see also Supplementary Information). FBXO25 has also been shown to target the HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) after apoptotic stress (24Baumann U. Fernández-Sáiz V. Rudelius M. Lemeer S. Rad R. Knorn A.M. Slawska J. Engel K. Jeremias I. Li Z. Tomiatti V. Illert A.L. Targosz B.S. Braun M. Perner S. et al.Disruption of the PRKCD-FBXO25-HAX-1 axis attenuates the apoptotic response and drives lymphomagenesis.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that Myc-FBXO25 expression in MEFs accelerated the loss of HAX1 induced by etoposide, as previously reported (24Baumann U. Fernández-Sáiz V. Rudelius M. Lemeer S. Rad R. Knorn A.M. Slawska J. Engel K. Jeremias I. Li Z. Tomiatti V. Illert A.L. Targosz B.S. Braun M.

Med. 2014; 20: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas the ΔF-box mutant did not [Fig. 3, G–H]. No corresponding change in the level of endogenous ELK-1 was observed. On the basis of the results with Hand1 and HAX-1, we conclude that ectopically expressed FBXO25 is active in cells, although its activity appears to be modest. Ectopic FBXO25 expression was previously shown to impair ELK-1 target gene expression in HEK293T cells (22Teixeira F.R. Manfiolli A.O. Soares C.S. Baqui M.M. Koide T. Gomes M.D. The F-box protein FBXO25 promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of ELK-1 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 28152-28162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and conceivably, gene expression may be sensitive to even slight changes in ELK-1 ubiquitination. However, in unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated HEK293T cells, we found that mRNA levels of ELK-1 target genes CFOS and EGR1 were unaffected by FBXO25 expression [Fig. 4, A–B]. In contrast, expression of USP17, but not a catalytically inactive USP17 mutant or USP7, had a significant impact on ELK-1 target gene expression, consistent with its ability to deubiquitinate ELK-1 [Fig. 4, C–D] (14Ducker C. Chow L.K.Y. Saxton J. Handwerger J. McGregor A. Strahl T. Layfield R. Shaw P.E.

HEK293T cells were reported to express endogenous FBXO25, for which several isoforms exist (25Maragno A.L. Baqui M.M. Gomes M.D. FBXO25, an F-box protein homologue of atrogin-1, is not induced in atrophying muscle.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We first confirmed expression of FBXO25 isoforms (∼3% of ectopic FBXO25 expression) [Fig. 5A; lane 7]. To see if this low endogenous FBXO25 expression accounted for ELK-1 polyubiquitination observed in HEK293T cells, we used two shRNAs to target FBXO25. Although each shRNA decreased FBXO25 expression in HEK293T cells [Fig. 5B], neither diminished polyubiquitination of ELK-1 [Fig. 5C]. As with its overexpression, depletion of FBXO25 had no impact on CFOS and EGR1 mRNA levels [Fig. 5D]. In contrast, shRNA-mediated depletion of USP17 caused an increase in the levels of ubiquitinated ELK-1 [Fig. 5E] and a significant decrease in CFOS and EGR1 mRNA levels [Fig. 5F]. These results confirm that altering the ubiquitination status of ELK-1 affects the expression of its target genes (14Ducker C. Chow L.K.Y. Saxton J. Handwerger J. McGregor A. Strahl T. Layfield R. Shaw P.E. De-ubiquitination of ELK-1 by USP17 potentiates mitogenic gene expression and cell proliferation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 4495-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In summary, FBXO25 and USP17 appear unlikely to act antagonistically toward ELK-1. Although ectopically expressed FBXO25 interacted with ELK-1 and the interaction mapped to a previously defined cryptic degron in ELK-1 (13Evans E.L. Saxton J. Shelton S.J. Begitt A. Holliday N.D. Hipskind R.A. Shaw P.E. Dimer formation and conformational flexibility ensure cytoplasmic stability and nuclear accumulation of Elk-1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6390-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it did not increase ELK-mUBQ nor ELK-pUBQ levels in HEK293T or HeLa cells, nor did it affect ELK-1 turnover. Conversely, FBXO25 depletion did not decrease ELK-pUBQ levels in HEK293T cells. Moreover, neither expression nor depletion of FBXO25 altered ELK-1 target gene expression. We confirmed that FBXO25 was active toward Hand1 and HAX1, two independently defined FBXO25 substrates (23Jang J.W. Lee W.Y. Lee J.H. Moon S.H. Kim C.H. Chung H.M.

Med. 2014; 20: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and showed that levels of ELK-1 ubiquitination and target gene expression can be modulated in synchrony by varying the ubiquitin profile of ELK-1 with USP17. Our findings provide further evidence that ubiquitination modulates ELK-1 activity but do not support the notion that FBXO25 is the principal ELK-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Possible reasons why our findings differ from those reported previously for FBXO25 (22Teixeira F.R. Manfiolli A.O. Soares C.S. Baqui M.M. Koide T. Gomes M.D. The F-box protein FBXO25 promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of ELK-1 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 28152-28162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) include: the likely divergence of HEK293T cells cultured in separate labs over time, the different FBXO25 expression constructs employed, and the alternative experimental conditions used for ubiquitination assays. Our data also indicate that methods to detect interactions between E3 ubiquitin ligases and prospective clients, either in vitro or in cells, should not be considered a reliable basis for inferring productive, functional relationships. We conclude that the E3 ubiquitin ligase with an important role in limiting ELK-1 activity during cell proliferation and vertebrate development remains to be identified. HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U ml−1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in DMEM high glucose, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U ml−1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin.

HEK293T cells at a density of 3 × 106 cells per 10 cm dish were transfected with a total of 10 μg DNA via calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation. HeLa cells were transfected with TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus Bio); MEFs were transfected using the K2 transfection system (Biontex). Experiments were performed essentially as described previously (26Galbraith M. Saxton J. Li L. Shelton S.J. Espinosa J.M. Zhang H.M. Shaw P.E.

Immune complexes were collected on protein G Sepharose beads by centrifugation, washed five times in co-IP buffer, and released by boiling in SDS gel-loading buffer. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 6 M Guanidinium-HCl and protein–ubiquitin conjugates were captured by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Ni-NTA Agarose beads (Qiagen) were incubated in cell lysates for 2 h at RT and washed five times in 8 M urea. Proteins conjugates were released from the beads in SDS gel-loading buffer containing 200 mM imidazole, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting. HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors for ELK-1 and FBXO25 or control vector. Forty hours posttransfection, cells were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) at a concentration of 200 μM for 4 to 20 h. Samples were lysed in RIPA buffer, normalized for protein concentration, and ELK-1 protein levels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HEK293T cells were transfected with a vector encoding His-tagged Hand1 and harvested after 48 h. IMAC-enriched Hand1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE, excised from the gel, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. Peptides were submitted to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on an LTQ-Orbitrap spectrometer with nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC). Identification of peptides was conducted in data-dependent mode, utilizing Scaffold (4.11.1) software to assign peaks using the Mascot (2.7.0) search engine, with raw data files run against the human Uniprot database (2018), cRAP database (2019), and a custom Hand1-His sequence (93,735 proteins, 2 max missed cleavages, precursor ion mass tolerance 20 PPM, fragment ion mass tolerance 0.100 Da, peptide threshold 95% minimum, peptide false discovery rate 0.4%). Carbamidomethyl (+57 on C) was considered a fixed modification, while deamidation (+1 on NQ), oxidation (+16 on M), phosphorylation (+80 on STY), and ubiquitination (+114 on K) were considered as variable modifications. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed as previously described (26Galbraith M. Saxton J. Li L. Shelton S.J. Espinosa J.M. Zhang H.M. Shaw P.E.

https://openalex.org/W3120069345,"Purpose To analyze the short-term therapeutic efficacy of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB) for chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) according to the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods A retrospective chart review was perfomed on cases of CSC with CNV (Group 1: n = 31) and an age-matched cases of CSC without CNV (Group 2: n = 30). The response to IVB was evaluated by changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), choroidal thickness (CT), and pachyvessel diameter. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the visual outcome of chronic CSC with CNV after IVB. Results At baseline, the CT values differed significantly between Groups 1 and 2 (371.55 ± 67.09 vs. 417.33 ± 71.32 μ m, p = 0.01). In Group 1, BCVA improved significantly (p &lt; 0.001), and CMT (p &lt; 0.001), CT (p = 0.001) and pachyvessel diameter (p = 0.045) decreased significantly, after IVB. In Group 2, only pachyvessel diameter (p = 0.001) was significantly smaller after IVB. Univariate analysis showed that the initial CT (B = 0.002, p = 0.026) and pachyvessel diameter (B = 0.002, p = 0.001) significantly affected visual outcome. In multivariate analysis, the initial pachyvessel diameter exhibited significant results (B = 0.002, p = 0.001). Conclusions IVB showed less effective short-term outcomes in chronic CSC patients without CNV than in patients with CNV. In chronic CSC with CNV, the short-term visual outcome after IVB was better in patients with a thinner choroid and smaller pachyvessels."
https://openalex.org/W3120926585,"Objective Fatigue in road traffic can occur after long driving times or during night-time driving and can lead to a dangerous decrease in vigilance or microsleep. As a countermeasure, the effectiveness of brain stimulation by means of frequency-modified music is investigated. Small frequency shifts between two different sounds simultaneously perceived by both ears (e.g. 400 and 418 Hz) stimulate the brain to increase activity in the stimulated range (e.g. 18 Hz). Methods The effects of acoustic brain entrainment (ABE) in the EEG beta range (12–20 Hz) were compared to placebo during day and night driving (n = 40 each) in 80 subjects. The effects were examined at the subjective (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS), physiological (EEG) and performance level (test battery for attention testing, TAP). The test drive took place on the motorway. Sequence of events with measurement times: Preparation in the laboratory (60 min; TAP &amp; KSS), driving (90 min day/ 180 min night; KSS every 30 min), beta/placebo stimulation while driving (20 min), rest (20 min; TAP &amp; KSS), driving (60 min; KSS every 30 min), end of driving (40 min; TAP &amp; KSS). EEG was recorded continuously (Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, C4) and analyzed for 10 min time windows. Results The subjective fatigue rating in the KSS decreased significantly after ABE compared to placebo. This was still significant about 100 minutes after stimulation. The ABE led to a significant increase in EEG beta activity compared to placebo. This was still significant about 80 minutes after stimulation. Furthermore, the ABE led to a significant decrease in theta activity compared to placebo. This was still significant about 70 minutes after stimulation and was more pronounced during daytime driving. Faster reaction times were observed for the ABE compared to the placebo condition during day and night driving. The faster reaction times were partly significant for the ABE still 80 minutes after stimulation. Conclusion Positive effects of ABE during driving could be demonstrated on the subjective, physiological and performance level. The effect was more pronounced during the day than at night. No negative side effects of Beta Stimulation were observed. The stimulation in the beta frequency range led to an increase of beta activity in the EEG."
https://openalex.org/W3119218152,"Automated testing of HIV serology on clinical chemistry analysers has become common. High sample throughput, high HIV prevalence and instrument design could all contribute to sample cross-contamination by microscopic droplet carry-over from seropositive samples to seronegative samples resulting in false positive low-reactive results. Following installation of an automated shared platform at our public health laboratory, we noted an increase in low reactive and false positive results. Subsequently, we investigated HIV serology screening test results for a period of 21 months. Of 485 initially low positive or equivocal samples 411 (85%) tested negative when retested using an independently collected sample. As creatinine is commonly requested with HIV screening, we used it as a proxy for concomitant clinical chemistry testing, indicating that a sample had likely been tested on a shared high-throughput instrument. The contamination risk was stratified between samples passing the clinical chemistry module first versus samples bypassing it. The odds ratio for a false positive HIV serology result was 4.1 (95% CI: 1.69–9.97) when creatinine level was determined first, versus not, on the same sample, suggesting contamination on the chemistry analyser. We subsequently issued a notice to obtain dedicated samples for HIV serology and added a suffix to the specimen identifier which restricted testing to a dedicated instrument. Low positive and false positive rates were determined before and after these interventions. Based on measured rates in low positive samples we estimate that before the intervention, of 44 117 HIV screening serology samples, 753 (1.71%) were false positive, declining to 48 of 7 072 samples (0.68%) post-intervention (p&lt;0.01). Our findings showed that automated high throughput shared diagnostic platforms are at risk of generating false-positive HIV test results, due to sample contamination and that measures are required to address this. Restricting HIV serology samples to a dedicated platform resolved this problem."

Five national social dimensions, representing 198 questions and 56 countries are discovered using multidimensional item response theory (MIRT). They are (1) Religiosity, (2) Neutrality, (3) Fairness, (4) Skepticism, and (5) Societal Tranquility. This approach is unique from previous quantitative models because it groups responses by country and analyzes binary, nominal, and ordinal survey questions. It is possible today due to recent advancements in computing power and programming. Furthermore, this methodology tests the validity of previous quantitative dimensions and finds that some of the existing social and cultural dimensions are not clearly discernable. Therefore, this model provides not only more a rigorous methodology but also new social dimensions which more accurately quantify underlying differences across countries in the World Values Survey. Like other quantitative cross-cultural models, this model is a deeply simplified representation of national social differences. However, it is a useful tool for modeling national differences and can be used to help us understand the impacts of social preferences and values on different political, economic, and development variables."

We employed a nominal group technique (NGT) process to systematically develop high-quality indicators for evaluating actual usage of EHRs in LMICs. Methods An initial set of 14 candidate indicators were developed by the study team adapting the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting indicators format. A multidisciplinary team of 10 experts was convened in a two-day NGT workshop in Kenya to systematically evaluate, rate (using Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound (SMART) criteria), prioritize, refine, and identify new indicators. NGT steps included introduction to candidate indicators, silent indicator ranking, round-robin indicator rating, and silent generation of new indicators. 5-point Likert scale was used in rating the candidate indicators against the SMART components. Results Candidate indicators were rated highly on SMART criteria (4.05/5). NGT participants settled on 15 final indicators, categorized as system use (4); data quality (3), system interoperability (3), and reporting (5). Data entry statistics, systems uptime, and EHRs variable concordance indicators were rated highest. Conclusion This study describes a systematic approach to develop and validate quality indicators for determining EHRs use and provides LMICs with a multidimensional tool for assessing success of EHRs implementations."
