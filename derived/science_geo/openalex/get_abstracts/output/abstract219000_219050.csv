https://openalex.org/W136942021,"A method for t.he purification of n-gluconate 6-phosphate dchydrogenase from brewers’ yeast has been described by Horecker and Smyrniotis. (1). The enzyme preparation also catalyzed the oxidation of n-glucose 6-phosphate and isocitrate and in addition contained significant amounts of n-ribose 5-phosphate isomerasc. The utility of the enzyme for the assay of n-gluconate 6-phosphato and for the preparation of n-ribulose 5-phosphate was seriously affected by the prcsencc of thcsc contaminating activitics. For a further investigation of the properties of the enzyme and of the nature of the two-step reaction, a more highly purified preparation was necessary. A method has now been developed which yields from Candida yeast a crystalline preparation which is free of detectable quantitics of I)-glucose 6-phosphata dchydrogenase and r)-ribose 5-phosphate isomerasc. To remove the former enzyme, advantage was taken of its lability to heat after treatment with charcoal (2, 3). n-Glucose 6-phosphate dchydrogcnasc is known to bc unstable in t,he absence of triphosphopyridine nuclcotidc. With the purified enzyme, only n-ribulosc 5-phosphate is formed, and this ester can thus be obtained free of n-ribose 5-phosphate and n-xylulose j-phosphate. Since the crystalline enzyme preparation catalyzes the osidation of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide by CO, and o-ribulose phosphate at a rate equal to that observed with crude enzyme preparations, wc have concluded that a single enzyme is rcsponsible for both oxidation and decarboxylation reactions. We have also undertaken an investigation of the specificity of the Mg++ requirement (1) and havn found that at high concentrations of NaCl, full activity is obtained in the absence of Mg++. There is reason to believe that the nature of t,he anion plays a role in the activation of the enzyme."

It also hastened the secondary uptake of streptomycin, which represents an increase in the number of freely accessible binding sites. In contrast, brief treatment with streptomycin failed to affect subsequent killing by penicillin. These findings suggest that the synergism of penicillin with streptomycin depends on the damaging effect of penicillin on the cell membrane, which promotes further damage by streptomycin and increases its subsequent access to intracellular sites. Observations on a streptomycin-resistant mutant are also reported."

https://openalex.org/W2014707997,"A LINKAGE investigation has been carried out in American Negroes to confirm that deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is sex linked rather than sex limited1, and, if sex linked, to determine the recombination fraction (χ) between the loci for deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and colour-blindness; further, through the use of linkage, to see if the difference between the expression of deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in Negroes and Caucasians2 is explicable on the basis of different genetic loci in the different ethnic groups."

Since no lethal effect was observed, there is no indication that the vacuum of outer space would prevent transport of viable microorganisms on unsterilized space vehicles."

https://openalex.org/W2046599110,Several tris-substituted derivatives of phosphoric acid synergized the toxicity of malathion to resistant houseflies and mosquitoes. In some tests it was possible to overcome acquired resistance completely. The synergists had much less effect on the toxicity of malathion to susceptible strains of the same species.

https://openalex.org/W1984499202,Inbred mice susceptible to audiogenic seizures were found to develop resistance to the protective effects of chlorpromazine and its analogs. It is proposed that the use of such inbred mice provides a unique new tool for studying drug mechanism and drug resistance.

https://openalex.org/W1982718834,"THE transplantability of virus-induced chicken leukaemia has never been clearly established. If intact cells are transferred to a homologous recipient bird, a leukaemia may develop. This has been interpreted as a transplanted leukaemia rather than the ordinary virus-induced disease mainly on the basis of an unusually rapid course1,2. The proof of the ability of leukaemic cells to grow in a homologous host rests, however, on the recognition of donor cells in the recipient. This communication describes the use of sex chromosomes as reliable markers for such a purpose. The technique takes advantage of the fact that male chicken cells contain two sex chromosomes of equal size, whereas the female cells contain only one (Fig. 1)."
