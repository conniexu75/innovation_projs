If the material is too soft, it will be mechanically degraded, and if it is too hard it may get covered with scar tissue or it may damage the surrounding tissues. Starting with a transparent silicone substrate, Minev et al. patterned microfluidic channels to allow for drug delivery, and soft platinum/silicone electrodes and stretchable gold interconnects for transmitting electrical excitations and transferring electrophysiological signals. In tests of spinal cord implants, the soft neural implants showed biointegration and functionality within the central nervous system. Science , this issue p. 159"

Xu et al. develop an ingenious design strategy for the microfabrication of complex geometric 3D mesostructures that derive from the out-of-plane buckling of an originally planar structural layout (see the Perspective by Ye and Tsukruk). Finite element analysis of the mechanics makes it possible to design the two 2D patterns, which is then attached to a previously strained substrate at a number of points. Relaxing of the substrate causes the patterned material to bend and buckle, leading to its 3D shape. Science , this issue p. 154 ; see also p. 130"

Cullen et al. begin to analyze how one dominant symbiont, Bacteroidetes thetaiotaomicron , does this. Our guts release potent antimicrobial peptides when we become infected with pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella, but these symbionts make an outer lipopolysaccharide coat that differs from those of pathogens by only one phosphate molecule. Enzymatic removal of this group is enough to confer resistance to the host's immune response and allow the symbionts to escape damage. Science , this issue p. 170"

Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair systems are present in all domains of life and help deal with these potentially lethal lesions. Ochi et al. have discovered a new factor involved in NHEJ by searching for proteins with structural similarities to known NHEJ proteins. Specifically, PAXX, a paralog of XRCC1 and XLF, interacts with a key repair pathway protein, Ku, and helps promote ligation of the broken DNA. Science , this issue p. 185"

If the cooling is done very slowly, this symmetry change is uniform throughout the system. For a faster cooling process, the system breaks up into domains: The faster the cooling, the smaller the domains. Navon et al. studied this process in an ultracold gas of Rb atoms near its transition to a condensed state (see the Perspective by Ferrari). The authors found that the size of the domains froze in time in the vicinity of the transition and that it depended on the cooling speed, as predicted by theory.

Ezenwa and Jolles, working on wild African buffaloes, expected that because deworming relieves immune suppression, such treatment would lead to a drop in tuberculosis because the animals would clear the second infection without further intervention. Not so. Deworming did improve the lot of parasite-infested individuals, but it also increased the spread of tuberculosis among the population. What apparently happened is that the worm-free buffalo lived longer but stayed infected with tuberculosis and had longer to spread the infection among the herd. Science , this issue p. 175"

During operation, both Ag and V ions are reduced, and the Ag atoms can form wires to enhance the internal conductivity. Kirshenbaum et al. probe the discharge of a battery at different rates and track the formation of Ag atoms using in situ energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction (see the Perspective by Dudney and Li). They show how the discharge rate affects whether the Ag or V is preferentially reduced and also the distribution of the Ag atoms, and then correlate this to the loss of battery capacity at higher discharge rates.

https://openalex.org/W2057002961,"Due to its unique location, the endothelial surface glycocalyx (ESG) at the luminal side of the microvessel wall may serve as a mechano-sensor and transducer of blood flow and thus regulate endothelial functions. To examine this role of the ESG, we used fluorescence microscopy to measure nitric oxide (NO) production in post-capillary venules and arterioles of rat mesentery under reduced (low) and normal (high) flow conditions, with and without enzyme pretreatment to remove heparan sulfate (HS) of the ESG and in the presence of an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). Rats (SD, 250–300g) were anesthetized. The mesentery was gently taken out from the abdominal cavity and arranged on the surface of a glass coverslip for the measurement. An individual post-capillary venule or arteriole was cannulated and loaded for 45 min with 5 μM 4, 5-Diaminofluorescein diacetate, a membrane permeable fluorescent indictor for NO, then the NO production was measured for ~10 min under a low flow (~300 μm/s) and for ~60 min under a high flow (~1000 μm/s). In the 15 min after switching to the high flow, DAF-2-NO fluorescence intensity increased to 1.27-fold of its baseline, DAF-2-NO continuously increased under the high flow, to 1.53-fold of its baseline in 60 min. Inhibition of eNOS by 1 mM L-NMMA attenuated the flow-induced NO production to 1.13-fold in 15 min and 1.30-fold of its baseline in 60 min, respectively. In contrast, no significant increase in NO production was observed after switching to the high flow for 60 min when 1 h pretreatment with 50 mU/mL heparanase III to degrade the ESG was applied. Similar NO production was observed in arterioles under low and high flows and under eNOS inhibition. Our results suggest that ESG participates in endothelial cell mechanosensing and transduction through its heparan sulfate to activate eNOS."

https://openalex.org/W2124167914,"Promoting bone regeneration and repair of bone defects is a need that has not been well met to date. We have previously found that adenosine, acting via receptors (A2AR) promotes wound healing and inhibits inflammatory osteolysis and hypothesized that A2AR might be a novel target to promote bone regeneration. Therefore, we determined whether direct A2AR stimulation or increasing endogenous adenosine concentrations via purine transport blockade with dipyridamole regulates bone formation. We determined whether coverage of a 3 mm trephine defect in a mouse skull with a collagen scaffold soaked in saline, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2; 200 ng), 1 μM CGS21680 (A2AR agonist, EC50 = 160 nM), or 1 μM dipyridamole (EC50 = 32 nM) promoted bone regeneration. Microcomputed tomography examination demonstrated that CGS21680 and dipyridamole markedly enhanced bone regeneration as well as BMP-2 8 wk after surgery (60 ± 2%, 79 ± 2%, and 75 ± 1% bone regeneration, respectively, vs. 32 ± 2% in control, P < 0.001). Blockade by a selective A2AR antagonist (ZM241385, 1 μM) or deletion of A2AR abrogated the effect of CGS21680 and dipyridamole on bone regeneration. Both CGS21680 and dipyridamole treatment increased alkaline phosphatase-positive osteoblasts and diminished tartrate resistance acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts in the defects. In vivo imaging with a fluorescent dye for new bone formation revealed a strong fluorescent signal in treated animals that was equivalent to BMP-2. In conclusion, stimulation of A2AR by specific agonists or by increasing endogenous adenosine levels stimulates new bone formation as well as BMP-2 and represents a novel approach to stimulating bone regeneration.—Mediero, A., Wilder, T., Perez-Aso, M., Cronstein, B.

https://openalex.org/W1965627828,"Fire seasonality, an important characteristic of fire regimes, commonly is delineated using seasons based on single weather variables (rainfall or temperature). We used nonparametric cluster analyses of a 17-year (1993–2009) data set of weather variables that influence likelihoods and spread of fires (relative humidity, air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, soil moisture) to explore seasonality of fire in pine savanna-grassland landscapes at the Avon Park Air Force Range in southern Florida. A four-variable, three-season model explained more variation within fire weather variables than models with more seasons. The three-season model also delineated intra-annual timing of fire more accurately than a conventional rainfall-based two-season model. Two seasons coincided roughly with dry and wet seasons based on rainfall. The third season, which we labeled the fire season, occurred between dry and wet seasons and was characterized by fire-promoting conditions present annually: drought, intense solar radiation, low humidity, and warm air temperatures. Fine fuels consisting of variable combinations of pyrogenic pine needles, abundant C4 grasses, and flammable shrubs, coupled with low soil moisture, and lightning ignitions early in the fire season facilitate natural landscape-scale wildfires that burn uplands and across wetlands. We related our three season model to fires with different ignition sources (lightning, military missions, and prescribed fires) over a 13-year period with fire records (1997–2009). Largest wildfires originate from lightning and military ignitions that occur within the early fire season substantially prior to the peak of lightning strikes in the wet season. Prescribed ignitions, in contrast, largely occur outside the fire season. Our delineation of a pronounced fire season provides insight into the extent to which different human-derived fire regimes mimic lightning fire regimes. Delineation of a fire season associated with timing of natural lightning ignitions should be useful as a basis for ecological fire management of humid savanna-grassland landscapes worldwide."

Here, we show that the proPO system is an important component of the Penaeus monodon shrimp immune defense toward a major viral pathogen, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Gene silencing of PmproPO(s) resulted in increased cumulative shrimp mortality after WSSV infection, whereas incubation of WSSV with an in vitro melanization reaction prior to injection into shrimp significantly increased the shrimp survival rate. The hemolymph phenoloxidase (PO) activity of WSSV-infected shrimp was extremely reduced at days 2 and 3 post-injection compared with uninfected shrimp but was fully restored after the addition of exogenous trypsin, suggesting that WSSV probably inhibits the activity of some proteinases in the proPO cascade. Using yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays, the viral protein WSSV453 was found to interact with the proPO-activating enzyme 2 (PmPPAE2) of P. monodon. Gene silencing of WSSV453 showed a significant increase of PO activity in WSSV-infected shrimp, whereas co-silencing of WSSV453 and PmPPAE2 did not, suggesting that silencing of WSSV453 partially restored the PO activity via PmPPAE2 in WSSV-infected shrimp. Moreover, the activation of PO activity in shrimp plasma by PmPPAE2 was significantly decreased by preincubation with recombinant WSSV453. These results suggest that the inhibition of the shrimp proPO system by WSSV partly occurs via the PmPPAE2-inhibiting activity of WSSV453.

https://openalex.org/W1993119026,"CCDC103 is an ∼29-kDa protein consisting of a central RPAP3_C domain flanked by N- and C-terminal coiled coils. Defects in CCDC103 lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia caused by the loss of outer dynein arms. This protein is present along the entire length of the ciliary axoneme and does not require other dynein or docking complex components for its integration. Unlike other known dynein assembly factors within the axoneme, CCDC103 is not solubilized by 0.6 M NaCl and requires more chaotropic conditions, such as 0.5 M KI. Alternatively, it can be extracted using 0.3% sarkosyl. CCDC103 forms stable dimers and other oligomers in solution through interactions involving the central domain. The smallest particle observed by dynamic light scattering has a hydrodynamic diameter of ∼25 nm. Furthermore, CCDC103 binds microtubules directly, forming ∼9-nm diameter particles that exhibit a 12-nm spacing on the microtubule lattice, suggesting that there may be two CCDC103 units per outer arm dynein repeat. Although the outer dynein arm docking complex is necessary to form arrays of dyneins along microtubules, it is not sufficient to set up a single array in a precise location on each axonemal doublet. We propose that CCDC103 helps generate a high-affinity site on the doublets for outer arm assembly, either through direct interactions or indirectly, perhaps by modifying the underlying microtubule lattice."

Recently, AQP1 was reported to interact with β-catenin. Here we investigated the relationship between AQP1 and Wnt signaling in in vitro and in vivo models of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD). AQP1 overexpression decreased β-catenin and cyclinD1 expression, suggesting down-regulation of Wnt signaling, and coimmunoprecipitation showed AQP1 interaction with β-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, LRP6, and Axin1. AQP1 inhibited cyst development and promoted branching in matrix-grown MDCK cells. In embryonic kidney cultures, AQP1 deletion increased cyst development by up to ~40%. Kidney size and cyst number were significantly greater in AQP1-null PKD mice than in AQP1-expressing PKD mice, with the difference mainly attributed to a greater number of proximal tubule cysts. Biochemical analysis revealed decreased β-catenin phosphorylation and increased β-catenin expression in AQP1-null PKD mice, suggesting enhanced Wnt signaling. These results implicate AQP1 as a novel determinant in renal cyst development that may involve inhibition of Wnt signaling by an AQP1-macromolecular signaling complex.—Wang, W., Li, F., Sun, Y., Lei, L., Zhou, H., Lei, T., Xia, Y., Verkman, A.

https://openalex.org/W2064577716,"Rhythmic physiology is central to retinal function and survival and adapts vision to daily light intensity changes. Mammalian retina rhythmically releases melatonin when cultured under constant conditions, and the occurrence of clock gene [e.g., Period(Per)] expression has been shown for most cellular layers. However, contribution of the distinct layers to genesis of circadian rhythms within the retina is still debated. To characterize their endogenous oscillatory capacity and their communication at the whole-tissue level, we used a vibratome-based method to isolate individual or paired retina cellular layers from the mPer2Luc mouse and Per1-luciferase (Per1-Luc) rat, and real-time recorded bioluminescence. We report that each layer of the mouse retina harbors a self-sustained oscillator whose period is significantly longer (~26 hours) than in whole-retina explants (~22.9 hours), indicating that the period is correlated with the degree of coupling. Accordingly, the maximal period (~29 hours) is reached upon complete enzymatic dissociation of the retina. By using pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that connection between retina oscillators involves gap junctions but only minor contribution from the main retina neurochemicals. Taken together with results from Per1-Luc rats, these data show that mammalian retina consists of a network of layer-specific oscillators whose period is determined by their connectivity.—Jaeger, C., Sandu, C., Malan, A., Mellac, K., Hicks, D., Felder-Schmittbuhl, M.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2172271246,"Land-use intensification is a central element in proposed strategies to address global food security. One rationale for accepting the negative consequences of land-use intensification for farmland biodiversity is that it could 'spare' further expansion of agriculture into remaining natural habitats. However, in many regions of the world the only natural habitats that can be spared are fragments within landscapes dominated by agriculture. Therefore, land-sparing arguments hinge on land-use intensification having low spillover effects into adjacent protected areas, otherwise net conservation gains will diminish with increasing intensification. We test, for the first time, whether the degree of spillover from farmland into adjacent natural habitats scales in magnitude with increasing land-use intensity. We identified a continuous land-use intensity gradient across pastoral farming systems in New Zealand (based on 13 components of farmer input and soil biogeochemistry variables), and measured cumulative off-site spillover effects of fertilisers and livestock on soil biogeochemistry in 21 adjacent forest remnants. Ten of 11 measured soil properties differed significantly between remnants and intact-forest reference sites, for both fenced and unfenced remnants, at both edge and interior. For seven variables, the magnitude of effects scaled significantly with magnitude of surrounding land-use intensity, through complex interactions with fencing and edge effects. In particular, total C, total N, δ15N, total P and heavy-metal contaminants of phosphate fertilizers (Cd and U) increased significantly within remnants in response to increasing land-use intensity, and these effects were exacerbated in unfenced relative to fenced remnants. This suggests movement of livestock into surrounding natural habitats is a significant component of agricultural spillover, but pervasive changes in soil biogeochemistry still occur through nutrient spillover channels alone, even in fenced remnants set aside for conservation. These results have important implications for the viability of land-sparing as a strategy for balancing landscape-level conservation and production goals in agricultural landscapes."

During PET acquisition, simultaneous diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI, b values: 0, 500, 1000 s/mm²) was performed. A maximum of 10 lymph nodes per patient suspicious for malignancy were analyzed. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn covering the entire lymph node on the attenuation-corrected PET-image and the monoexponential ADC-map. According to histopathology or radiological follow-up, lymph nodes were classified as benign or malignant. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for all lymph node metastases correlating SUVmax and SUVmean with ADCmean.A total of 146 suspicious lymph nodes were found in 25 patients. One hundred lymph nodes were eligible for final analysis. Ninety-one lymph nodes were classified as malignant and 9 as benign according to the reference standard. In malignant lesions, mean SUVmax was 9.1 ± 3.8 and mean SUVmean was 6.0 ± 2.5 while mean ADCmean was 877.0 ± 128.6 x10(-5) mm²/s in PET/MRI. For all malignant lymph nodes, a weak, inverse correlation between SUVmax and ADCmean as well as SUVmean and ADCmean (r = -0.30, p<0.05 and r = -0.36, p<0.05) existed.The present data show a weak inverse correlation between increased glucose-metabolism and cellularity in lymph node metastases of NSCLC patients. 18F-FDG-PET and DWI thus may offer complementary information for the evaluation of treatment response in lymph node metastases of NSCLC."

To understand this complex geometry, Leung et al. solved the structures of the entire transhydrogenase enzyme and the membrane domain from the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (see the Perspective by Krengel and Törnroth-Horsefield). The entire enzyme exists as a dimer, with the two membrane domains in alternate orientations.

Circadian oscillations are predicated on transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which balance the activities of the transcriptional activators CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and brain muscle arnt-like 1 and repressors encoded by PER (Period) and Cryptochrome genes. We show that loss of PER2 expression silences circadian oscillations in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). Down-regulation occurred between 12 and 24 hours following differentiation and coincided with reduced CLOCK binding to a noncanonical E-box enhancer in the PER2 promoter. RNA sequencing revealed that premature inhibition of PER2 by small interfering RNA knockdown leads to a grossly disorganized decidual response. Gene ontology analysis highlighted a preponderance of cell cycle regulators among the 1121 genes perturbed upon PER2 knockdown. Congruently, PER2 inhibition abrogated mitotic expansion of differentiating HESCs by inducing cell cycle block at G2/M. Analysis of 70 midluteal endometrial biopsies revealed an inverse correlation between PER2 transcript levels and the number of miscarriages in women suffering reproductive failure (Spearman rank test, ρ = -0.3260; P = 0.0046).

We show that CDRs exhibit phenomena such as periodic cycles of formation, spiral patterns, and mutual wave annihilations that are in accord with an active medium description of CDRs. On cells of controlled morphologies, CDRs exhibit extremely regular patterns of repeated wave formation and propagation, whereas on random-shaped cells the dynamics seem to be dominated by the limited availability of a reactive species.

https://openalex.org/W2132934625,"Age-related variation in demographic rates is now widely documented in wild vertebrate systems, and has significant consequences for population and evolutionary dynamics. However, the mechanisms underpinning such variation, particularly in later life, are less well understood. Foraging efficiency is a key determinant of fitness, with implications for individual life history trade-offs. A variety of faculties known to decline in old age, such as muscular function and visual acuity, are likely to influence foraging performance. We examine age-related variation in the foraging behaviour of a long-lived, wide-ranging oceanic seabird, the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans. Using miniaturised tracking technologies, we compared foraging trip characteristics of birds breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia. Based on movement and immersion data collected during the incubation phase of a single breeding season, and from extensive tracking data collected in previous years from different stages of the breeding cycle, we found limited evidence for age-related variation in commonly reported trip parameters, and failed to detect signs of senescent decline. Our results contrast with the limited number of past studies that have examined foraging behaviour in later life, since these have documented changes in performance consistent with senescence. This highlights the importance of studies across different wild animal populations to gain a broader perspective on the processes driving variation in ageing rates."

Kidney provides a relevant model for this evaluation because PrP(C) is expressed in the kidney, and ∼370 μg of iron are reabsorbed daily from the glomerular filtrate by kidney proximal tubule cells (PT), requiring ferrireductase activity. Here, we report that PrP(C) promotes the uptake of transferrin (Tf) and non-Tf-bound iron (NTBI) by the kidney in vivo and mainly NTBI by PT cells in vitro. Thus, uptake of (59)Fe administered by gastric gavage, intravenously, or intraperitoneally was significantly lower in PrP-knock-out (PrP(-/-)) mouse kidney relative to PrP(+/+) controls. Selective in vivo radiolabeling of plasma NTBI with (59)Fe revealed similar results. Expression of exogenous PrP(C) in immortalized PT cells showed localization on the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles and increased transepithelial transport of (59)Fe-NTBI and to a smaller extent (59)Fe-Tf from the apical to the basolateral domain. Notably, the ferrireductase-deficient mutant of PrP (PrP(Δ51-89)) lacked this activity. Furthermore, excess NTBI and hemin caused aggregation of PrP(C) to a detergent-insoluble form, limiting iron uptake. Together, these observations suggest that PrP(C) promotes retrieval of iron from the glomerular filtrate via its ferrireductase activity and modulates kidney iron metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2050773037,"Cryptic species complexes are common among parasites, which tend to have large populations and are subject to rapid evolution. Such complexes may arise through host-parasite co-evolution and/or host switching. For parasites that reproduce directly on their host, there might be increased opportunities for sympatric speciation, either by exploiting different hosts or different micro-habitats within the same host. The genus Gyrodactylus is a specious group of viviparous monogeneans. These ectoparasites transfer between teleosts during social contact and cause significant host mortality. Their impact on the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), an iconic evolutionary and ecological model species, is well established and yet the population genetics and phylogenetics of these parasites remains understudied. Using mtDNA sequencing of the host and its parasites, we provide evidence of cryptic speciation in Gyrodactylus bullatarudis, G. poeciliae and G. turnbulli. For the COII gene, genetic divergence of lineages within each parasite species ranged between 5.7 and 17.2%, which is typical of the divergence observed between described species in this genus. Different lineages of G. turnbulli and G. poeciliae appear geographically isolated, which could imply allopatric speciation. In addition, for G. poeciliae, co-evolution with a different host species cannot be discarded due to its host range. This parasite was originally described on P. caucana, but for the first time here it is also recorded on the guppy. The two cryptic lineages of G. bullatarudis showed considerable geographic overlap. G. bullatarudis has a known wide host range and it can also utilize a killifish (Anablepsoides hartii) as a temporary host. This killifish is capable of migrating overland and it could act as a transmission vector between otherwise isolated populations. Additional genetic markers are needed to confirm the presence of these cryptic Gyrodactylus species complexes, potentially leading to more in-depth genetic, ecological and evolutionary analyses on this multi-host-parasite system."
https://openalex.org/W1992436534,"The asphalt paving industries are faced with two major problems. These two important challenges are generated with an increase in demand for environmentally friendly paving mixtures and the problem of rapidly rising raw materials. Recycling of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is a critical necessity to save precious aggregates and reduce the use of costly bitumen. Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) technology provides not only the option of recycling asphalt pavement at a lower temperature than the temperature maintained in hot mixtures but also encourages the utilization of RAP and therefore saves energy and money. This paper describes the feasibility of utilizing three different WMA additives (organic, chemical and water containing) at recommended contents with different percentages of RAP. The mechanical properties and cost-benefit analysis of WMA containing RAP have been performed and compared with WMA without RAP. The results indicated that, 30%, 10% and 20% can be accepted as an optimum RAP addition related to organic, chemical and water containing additives respectively and organic additive with 30% RAP content has an appreciable increase in tensile strength over the control mix. It was also concluded that the RAP with WMA technology is the ability to reduce final cost compared to HMA and WMA mixtures."

We reported previously that TR sumoylation is essential for TR-mediated gene regulation and that mutation of either of the two sites in TRα or any of the three sites in TRβ reduces TR sumoylation. Here, we transfected TR sumoylation site mutants into human primary preadiocytes and the mouse 3T3L1 preadipocyte cell line to determine the role of TR sumoylation in adipogenesis. Reduced sumoylation of TRα or TRβ resulted in fewer and smaller lipid droplets and reduced proliferation of preadipocytes. TR sumoylation mutations, compared with wild-type TR, results in reduced C/EBP expression and reduced PPARγ2 mRNA and protein levels. TR sumoylation mutants recruited NCoR and disrupted PPARγ-mediated perilipin1 (Plin1) gene expression, associated with impaired lipid droplet formation. Expression of NCoRΔID, a mutant NCoR lacking the TR interaction domain, partially “rescued” the delayed adipogenesis and restored Plin1 gene expression and adipogenesis.

Patients with reduced or increased thyroid hormone levels experience changes in body weight and body composition due to thyroid hormone-mediated action on metabolic targets. In white adipose tissue (WAT), thyroid hormone enhances catecholamine-mediated lipolysis by stimulating expression of adrenergic receptors and enhancing sensitivity (1.Silva J.E. Bianco S.D.

Knock-out of the type 2 5′-deiodinase (D2) gene, which converts thyroxine to the T3 active form, is associated with reduced BAT activity and glucose intolerance. D2 knock-out mice have a defect in diet-induced thermogenesis, resulting in glucose intolerance, obesity, and enhanced hepatic steatosis (4.Castillo M. Hall J.A. Correa-Medina M. Ueta C. Kang H.W.

In contrast, anti-adipogenic factors GATA2/3, KLF2/7, TCF/LEF, Forkhead box O (FOXO), and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) inhibit PPARγ expression. A widely used in vitro model used to study adipogenesis is the mouse 3T3L1 cell line. 3T3L1 cells must be grown to confluence to reach growth arrest, a prerequisite for preadipocyte differentiation. However, another model, 3T3-F422 cells, is grown in suspension and differentiates without reaching confluence (16.Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During in vitro adipogenesis, 3T3L1 cells require induction by a hormonal mixture (insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) for 48–72 h. The cells undergo two rounds of clonal expansion prior to final growth arrest and differentiation. Human primary preadipocytes require a constant presence of the hormone mixture and differentiate without further cell division. Differentiated adipocytes are filled with intracellular lipid droplets before maturation. The lipid droplets are coated by perilipin1 (Plin1), a protein in which expression is largely restricted to adipose tissue and is highly induced during adipogenesis. Plin1 prevents unregulated lipolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase, facilitates lipid transfer into the lipid droplet, and enables adrenergic signal-stimulated lipolysis by allowing phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase to enter the lipid droplets (17.Subramanian V.

Previously, we identified sumoylation sites in TRα1 and TRβ1 and characterized TR sumoylation properties (24.Liu Y.Y. Kogai T. Schultz J.J. Mody K. Brent G.A. Thyroid hormone receptor isoform-specific modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modulates thyroid hormone-dependent gene regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 36499-36508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TRα1 is sumoylated at lysines 283 and 389 and TRβ at lysines 50, 146, and 443. TRα prefers E3 ligase PIASxβ, and TRβ prefers E3 ligase PIAS1. TRα, but not TRβ, requires T3 for sumoylation. TR isoform specificity in gene regulation has been linked to the relative level of TR isoform expression in a specific tissue, response element configuration in the regulated gene, and intrinsic properties of the receptor. A recent genome-wide study of genes regulated by TRα and TRβ suggests that TR isoform selectivity is not due to the response element sequence but to intrinsic receptor properties that influence the interaction with coactivator or corepressor (25.Chatonnet F. Guyot R. Benoît G. Flamant F. Genome-wide analysis of thyroid hormone receptors shared and specific functions in neural cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E766-E775Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). SUMO modification, therefore, may have a role in TR isoform specificity. Mutation of any sumoylation site impairs TR-dependent gene repression or induction (22.Langlois D. Forcheron F. Li J.Y. del Carmine P. Neggazi S. Beylot M. Increased atherosclerosis in mice deficient in perilipin1.Lipids Health Dis. 2011; 10: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously TR-SUMO conjugation in white adipose tissue (24.Liu Y.Y. Kogai T. Schultz J.J. Mody K. Brent G.A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 36499-36508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we mutated TR sumoylation sites to reduce the capacity for sumoylation and investigated whether TR sumoylation plays a role in adipocyte differentiation. We utilized the mouse 3T3L1 preadipocyte differentiation model for mechanistic studies and human primary preadipocytes to confirm that these mechanisms were relevant for human adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrated that TR-SUMO conjugation is necessary for preadipocyte proliferation, PPARγ-mediated gene expression, including Plin1 expression, and differentiation. The total number of fat cells in humans is set in late adolescence, although adipocytes in adults are constantly formed from preexisting preadipocytes, and ∼10% of subcutaneous adipocytes are replaced every year (26.Spalding K.L. Arner E. Westermark P.O. Bernard S. Buchholz B.A. Bergmann O. Blomqvist L. Hoffstedt J. Näslund E. Britton T. Concha H. Hassan M. Rydén M. Frisén J. Arner P. Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans.Nature. 2008; 453: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of TR in adipocyte differentiation provides important insights into the regulation of adipose tissue as well as potential novel therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases. Human subcutaneous primary preadipocytes purchased from Lonza Inc. (Basel, Switzerland) were grown in preadipocyte medium to 80% confluence and then collected for transfection. Transfection conditions were optimized using 4 μg of plasmid, 0.75 million cells, Nucleofector Kit V, and program V-033. Transfections were performed using a Nucleofector 2D device (Lonza). After electroporation, cells were grown in preadipocyte medium until growth arrest. The plating density after transfection was ∼11,000 cells/cm2. Cells were then differentiated in differentiation medium (Lonza) and maintained in the same medium for 9–12 days. The lipid droplets appeared after day 4 of differentiation. Expression vectors for sumoylation site mutants (hTRβ K50Q, K146Q, and K443Q and hTRα K283Q/K288R and K389Q) were cloned by site-directed mutagenesis into pCMVTnT and/or pCMV6 entry. 3T3L1 preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum. Cells were transduced with lentiviral shRNA-TRβ to silence mouse TRβ gene expression. Cells (1 million) were then transfected using Nucleofector Kit V, program T-028, with plasmids (4 μg each) expressing empty vector, hTRβ, hTRα, or sumoylation site mutations hTRβ K50Q, hTRβ K146Q, hTRβ K443Q or hTRα K283Q/K288R. After G418 selection, for 7 days, cells were grown to confluence followed by hormone mixture-induced differentiation. Stable transfection (without knockdown of endogenous TR) of 3T3L1 cells with TR and TR sumoylation site mutant experiments were conducted using nucleofection as described above. After 7 days of G418 selection, cells were grown to confluence and differentiated using the standard protocol. A C/EBP luciferase reporter vector carrying six C/EBP-binding elements (CCAAT) was purchased from Qiagen. Stably transfected 3T3L1 cells, as described above, were plated to 96 wells and grown to confluence. After 48 h of confluence, cells were treated with the adipocyte hormonal mixture to induce differentiation. After 24 h of induction, cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter using Attractene transfection reagent. Luciferase activity was recorded in a Multimode plate reader (Promega). The data represent the mean value of six replicate reporter assays. Cells were transfected as described above. After selection, cells were plated in a 96-well dish and grown for 36 h (∼80% confluence for control cells). Proliferation of the cells was analyzed (Cell Titer 96® aqueous kit, Promega). The absorbance at 490 nm was recorded in a Multimode plate reader (Promega). Proliferation was calculated as the mean value ± S.E. of 10 duplicates and presented as percent control (cells transfected with empty vector). Lipid droplets were imaged using standard protocols (27.Listenberger L.L. Brown D.A. Fluorescent detection of lipid droplets and associated proteins.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2007; 24: 24.2.1-24.2.11Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown and differentiated in chamber slides fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, incubated in 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY 493/503, Invitrogen) (1 μg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature and then mounted with DAPI-containing Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). BODIPY 493/503 stains neutral lipids. Imaging was performed using Zeiss 70 confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed twice with PBS followed by one wash with 60% isopropanol. Cells were then incubated with Oil Red O for 5 min, washed with H2O and photographed. Free fatty acids were determined using a kit (catalog No. ab65341, Abcam) that detects octanoate and longer chain free fatty acids by an enzyme-based method. Cells were grown in a 96-well dish. After differentiation for 9 days, free fatty acids in the media were quantitated following the instructions with the kit. 3T3L1 cells were transfected with NCoR-FLAG and pCMV-TNT TRβ expressing vectors using Nucleofector Kit V, program T-028. The FLAG immunoprecipitation kit, FLAGPT1 (Sigma-Aldrich), was used following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were lysed in lysis buffer. After centrifugation to remove the debris, the protein concentration in each sample was adjusted for uniformity. Each sample (1.0 ml of lysate) was incubated with anti-FLAG resin (60 μl) overnight. Immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled with 2× SDS sample buffer (20 μl) and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The antibodies used for the Western blot were anti-TRβ (1:500, ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., MA1-216) and anti-NCoR (1:500, Abcam, ab3482). Cells were transfected with empty vector for the co-immunoprecipitation control. Cell lysate (1.0 ml) was incubated with the anti-FLAG antibody. For input, cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using anti-TRβ. One-half of the immunoprecipitated protein was used in the Western blot as TRβ input. PPARγ expression was measured in 3T3L1 cells after 9 days of differentiation and lysis with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (Pierce). Protein from the crude lysate (30 μg) was loaded in 10% SDS-PAGE. The antibodies used were anti-PPARγ2 (1:500, rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-GAPDH, which recognizes a ∼35 kDa protein (1:1,000, mouse IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GAPDH was used as a loading control, and the Western blot was imaged using the BioSpectrum 310 system. A ChIP assay was performed using EZ-ChIPTM (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 3T3L1 cells were transfected and treated either with T3 or troglitazone (TZD) for 4 h. Cells were then incubated with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration) to cross-link chromatin. The antibodies used in the ChIP assay were anti-TRβ (1:50), anti-PPARγ (1:50, ThermoFisher Scientific, PA3-821A), and anti-NCoR (1:50, Millipore, MABE570). After the cross-linking was reversed, DNA was purified and then used for PCR amplification. The primers used were: for mouse Plin1 PRE (−2174/−1901), F, 5′-CCCCCTGTGGTGTTGGCGAAC-3′, and R, 5′-CAGAGGCCACTTTACACGCTC-3′ (GenBank accession No. NC_000073.6); for mouse aP2 PPRE (28.Aguilar V.

Human primary subcutaneous preadipocytes were transfected using Nucleofector as described above. Cells were then plated in a 6-cm dish and grown for 3 days (control cells were grown to ∼80% confluence). RNA was isolated and used for a Wnt signaling profiling array (Qiagen). The values were presented as the mean value from three separate experiments. The data were analyzed using Qiagen software. RNA was isolated from cells and reverse-transcribed using a Qiagen RT2 first-strand synthesis kit to measure expression of PPARγ2, CEBPβ, CEBPα, Plin1, adipoQ, and aP2. QuantiTech primers (Qiagen) were used. The PCR was done with triplicates, and the data presented are a mean value from two separate experiments. In brief, TRβ-BioChIP cells were generated by stable transfection of HepG2 cells with TRβ and BiRA (biotin ligase) expression vectors. Stably transfected TR-BioChIP cells were then transduced with lentiviral shRNA SUMO1 to knock down SUMO1 mRNA. Cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% serum replacement (Invitrogen) for 24 h and then treated with or without T3 (50 nm) for 4 h. Cells were cross-linked by formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1%. Chromatin was fragmented using a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode Inc.). Biotinylated TRβ-associated DNA fragments were precipitated using a streptavidin-based purification system. After ChIP-seq analysis, peak regions were identified, and ChIP enrichment at the peak region was analyzed using qPCR. Statistical analysis for two group comparisons was performed using a two-tailed Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. The p value was analyzed using the Qiagen software for the array data. TR sumoylation is essential for the regulation of thyroid hormone target genes in a range of transient transfection models (24.Liu Y.Y. Kogai T. Schultz J.J. Mody K. Brent G.A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 36499-36508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The biological importance of TR sumoylation, however, has not been established. We reported previously that TR sumoylation was observed in mouse WAT (24.Liu Y.Y. Kogai T. Schultz J.J. Mody K. Brent G.A. Thyroid hormone receptor isoform-specific modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modulates thyroid hormone-dependent gene regulation.J. Biol.

We therefore generated TR sumoylation site mutations in TRα and TRβ, TRα K283Q/K288R and TRβ K50Q, K146Q, and K443Q, to test the effects of TR sumoylation on adipogenesis in adipocyte differentiation models. Because Lys-283 and Lys-288 are interchangeable sites for sumoylation in TRα, a double mutation, K283Q/K288R, was generated. To investigate the role of TR sumoylation in preadipocyte differentiation, we transfected vectors expressing TRα and TRβ with sumoylation site mutations into human primary subcutaneous preadipocyte cells. We optimized transfection conditions using cell type-specific transfection solution in combination with electroporation programs and obtained a transfection efficiency up to 75% (Fig. 1A). Growth arrest, a prerequisite condition for preadipocyte differentiation, was confirmed by a stable cell number at 48 h. Control cells (transfected with empty vector or with a vector expressing TRα or TRβ) reached confluence and growth arrest after 4 days of transfection. Cells expressing TR sumoylation site mutations required 6 days to reach growth arrest. The cells were then differentiated, and intracellular lipid droplets were visualized by BODIPY 495/503, which stains neutral lipids. Control cells (transfected with empty vector or a vector expressing TRα or TRβ) were filled with cytoplasmic lipid-storing vesicles after 9 days of differentiation, indicating commitment to a terminal adipocyte lineage (Fig. 1B). Cells expressing TRβ and TRα sumoylation site mutants, however, had significantly fewer cells committed to differentiation and fewer and smaller lipid droplets in differentiated cells (Fig. 1, C and D). We next determined whether TR sumoylation mutants similarly disrupted preadipocyte differentiation in the well characterized mouse 3T3L1 cell line preadipocyte model. TRβ mRNA knockdown was used to reduce endogenous TRβ, and the cells were then stably transfected with TRβ sumoylation mutants. After differentiation for 9 days, cells expressing the TRβ sumoylation mutants, TRβ K146Q and K443Q, had only a few lipid droplets (Fig. 2A). TRβ K50Q-expressing cells had near normal differentiation, although the size and number of fat droplets were much less than in control cells (Fig. 2A). We quantitated the impact of TR sumoylation mutants on preadipocyte differentiation by measuring free fatty acids in the medium (Fig. 2B). TRβ K146Q-expressing cells had a 46% reduction compared with control cells and TRβ K4443Q-expressing cells a 62% reduction. TRβ K50Q-expressing cells had reduced free fatty"
https://openalex.org/W2169485277,"Objectives The precise relationship between sleep and physical and mental functioning in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has not been examined directly, nor has the impact of daytime napping. This study aimed to examine self-reported sleep in patients with CFS and explore whether sleep quality and daytime napping, specific patient characteristics (gender, illness length) and levels of anxiety and depression, predicted daytime fatigue severity, levels of daytime sleepiness and cognitive functioning, all key dimensions of the illness experience. Methods 118 adults meeting the 1994 CDC case criteria for CFS completed a standardised sleep diary over 14 days. Momentary functional assessments of fatigue, sleepiness, cognition and mood were completed by patients as part of usual care. Levels of daytime functioning and disability were quantified using symptom assessment tools, measuring fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Scale), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), cognitive functioning (Trail Making Test, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Results Hierarchical Regressions demonstrated that a shorter time since diagnosis, higher depression and longer wake time after sleep onset predicted 23.4% of the variance in fatigue severity (p <.001). Being male, higher depression and more afternoon naps predicted 25.6% of the variance in objective cognitive dysfunction (p <.001). Higher anxiety and depression and morning napping predicted 32.2% of the variance in subjective cognitive dysfunction (p <.001). When patients were classified into groups of mild and moderate sleepiness, those with longer daytime naps, those who mainly napped in the afternoon, and those with higher levels of anxiety, were more likely to be in the moderately sleepy group. Conclusions Napping, particularly in the afternoon is associated with poorer cognitive functioning and more daytime sleepiness in CFS. These findings have clinical implications for symptom management strategies."

Recent studies in Cell now reveal a dominant role of the microenvironment in shaping epigenetic identity of macrophages, thus providing support for alternative models of cell fate acquisition. Somatic reprogramming has relied heavily on theoretical models that view differentiation in terms of developmental branch point decisions. Recent studies in Cell now reveal a dominant role of the microenvironment in shaping epigenetic identity of macrophages, thus providing support for alternative models of cell fate acquisition. During development of a multicellular organism, a single totipotent zygote ultimately gives rise to multiple differentiated cell types with unique gene expression programs. A pioneer of epigenetics, the developmental biologist Conrad H. Waddington has likened this process to a ball rolling downhill through branching valleys that successively restrict developmental options until a stable state of terminal differentiation is reached at the bottom of the valley (Waddington, 1957Waddington C.H. The Strategy of Genes. Allen & Unwin, London1957Google Scholar). The model thus classifies cells according to their previous developmental decisions. In line with this, much work has focused on the mechanisms (particular transcription factors) that drive cell fate in a specific direction at the branch points of development (Graf and Enver, 2009Graf T. Enver T. Nature. 2009; 462: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have now used modern epigenetic analysis in macrophages to take a fresh look at the old question about the relative contributions that developmental history and the microenvironment make on determining cellular identity (Lavin et al., 2014Lavin Y.

Macrophages are particularly well-suited to address this question. They are present in essentially every tissue of the body and provide important homeostatic functions specific to the tissue of residence, such as axon pruning in the nervous system, clearance of surfactant in the lung, or regulation of B cells in the peritoneum. These tissue resident macrophages develop from early progenitors in the embryo (Perdiguero et al., 2014Perdiguero E.G. Klapproth K. Schulz C. Busch K. Azzoni E. Crozet L. Garner H. Trouillet C. de Bruijn M.F. Geissmann F. Rodewald H.R. Nature. 2014; (in press. Published online December 3, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) and can be maintained within their tissue of residence by local proliferation (Sieweke and Allen, 2013Sieweke M.H. Allen J.E. Science. 2013; 342: 1242974Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Under inflammatory conditions, with age, or after bone marrow transplantation, however, blood monocytes can replace embryo-derived macrophages and acquire similar tissue-specific functions (Gentek et al., 2014Gentek R. Molawi K. Sieweke M.H. Immunol. Rev. 2014; 262: 56-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Two studies in Cell now provide a detailed genome-wide map of open chromatin and enhancer-associated histone modifications for different tissue macrophages. They show that the environment dictates tissue-specific epigenetic enhancer signatures independently of cellular origin and thus plays a dominant role in specifying cellular identity (Lavin et al., 2014Lavin Y.

Most strikingly, upon transfer of differentiated macrophages from one tissue to another (Lavin et al., 2014Lavin Y. Winter D. Blecher-Gonen R. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Merad M. Jung S. Amit I. Cell. 2014; 159: 1312-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar) or upon tissue culture with factors specific for a different tissue (Gosselin et al., 2014Gosselin D. Link V.M. Romanoski C.E. Fonseca G.J. Eichenfield D.Z. Spann N.J. Stender J.D. Chun H.B. Garner H. Geissmann F. Glass C.K. Cell. 2014; 159: 1327-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), macrophages can acquire to a large extent the newly induced identity. The ability of the environment to impose tissue specialization on macrophages of diverse developmental origins suggests that the precise binary developmental decisions during cellular differentiation might be less critical than previously assumed, and it suggests that a highly similar cellular identity can be reached from different origins. These observations recall findings from experimental reprogramming between two differentiated mature cell types by defined transcription factor cocktails (Graf and Enver, 2009Graf T. Enver T. Nature. 2009; 462: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Such direct lineage conversions have now been reported between developmentally very distant cell types of different germ layer origin, such as fibroblasts, neurons, and hepatocytes. This outcome is difficult to reconcile with Waddington’s model (Figure 1A) because the energy required for a push over multiple ridges appears prohibitive. Furthermore, conversion can be achieved without passage through common developmental progenitors (stages 1, 2, and 3). This is indicated, for example, by genome-wide gene expression analysis during reprogramming of B cells into macrophages (Di Tullio et al., 2011Di Tullio A. Vu Manh T.P. Schubert A. Castellano G. Månsson R. Graf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 17016-17021Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or by lineage tracing techniques in the conversion of fibroblasts into motor neurons (Son et al., 2011Son E.Y. Ichida J.K. Wainger B.J. Toma J.S. Rafuse V.F. Woolf C.J. Eggan K. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 205-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). How can transitions between developmentally distant cells (a and c) be explained if they are many mountain ridges apart and if backtracking up the valley does not occur? Perhaps Waddington’s rolling hills are not the only landscape to model epigenetic identity. When visiting Melbourne it is hard to evade the legacy of the great explorer Captain James Cook. On his voyages through the Pacific islands he encountered a fundamentally different landscape without valleys and mountains, but rather, one of small and distant islands in a vast ocean. Could this scenario serve as an alternative model of cellular identity? When explaining cell identity we have to come to terms with the relatively limited number of a few hundred stable cell fates observed for the enormous number of possible combinations of over 20,000 coding genes. If we imagine each landmass on the surface of the Pacific Ocean to represent a theoretical possible combination of gene activities, the rare and widely dispersed geographical positions of small islands serve as a good analogy of the few stable cell fates. Indeed, mathematical modeling of antagonistic and self-enforcing gene activities, particularly transcriptional regulators, has identified rare but highly robust self-stabilizing states of defined gene activity (Huang, 2009Huang S. BioEssays. 2009; 31: 546-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In Waddington’s model cell identity depends on a sequence of correct branch point decisions. This is a navigation system we typically employ on land, where taking the right turn at each cross road indeed works well to get from one location to another. At sea, there are no roads or intersections. Routes are highly flexible but if the precise coordinates are known, a small island can be reached from many directions. In this model (Figure 1B) there is no conceptual hurdle to move between developmentally distant cell identities (c and a), as observed in direct lineage reprogramming or by placing macrophages in a new environment. Since Cook’s epigenetic landscape has no defined branch points, successful navigation would require a global positioning system to localize islands of stability. The genomic analyses of Lavin et al. and Gosselin et al. are providing such precise molecular coordinates of cellular identity. Using chromatin accessibility assays (ATAC sequencing) and ChiP-seq analysis of Histone 3 lysine 4 mono- or bi-methylation (H3K4me1/2) and promoter distal binding of the macrophage transcription factor PU.1, they reveal a detailed map of genomic enhancer positions in macrophages from different tissues. Consistent with previous studies, they show that genomic enhancer positions are highly cell type specific. They not only reveal enhancers shared by all macrophages but also positions that are specific to the tissue of residence. Confirming dominance of the microenvironment, highly similar enhancer landscapes were observed in endogenous or bone-marrow-transplant derived macrophages (Lavin et al., 2014Lavin Y. Winter D.

Interestingly, binding site analysis identified specific motif enrichment for transcription factors that cooperate with PU.1 to establish tissue-specific enhancers (Lavin et al., 2014Lavin Y.

In an ingenuous approach Gosselin et al. establish the functional importance of these binding sites by comparing enhancer marks and expression of associated genes in natural variants of these binding sites in different mouse strains (Gosselin et al., 2014Gosselin D. Link V.M. Romanoski C.E. Fonseca G.J. Eichenfield D.Z. Spann N.J. Stender J.D. Chun H.B. Garner H. Geissmann F. Glass C.K. Cell. 2014; 159: 1327-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Together such approaches could be useful to identify new transcription factor combinations for precisely tailored reprogramming efforts. Future genome-wide mapping of enhancer repertoires and characteristic transcription factor binding sites of different cell types in their natural microenvironment might enable understanding and manipulation of cellular identity without prior knowledge of developmental origin. This might be particularly important for applications wherein rather than a generic cell type a highly specific subtype would be required for tailored screening or therapeutic benefit.

https://openalex.org/W2143773708,"Adequate availability of iron is important for cellular energy metabolism. Catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine promote energy expenditure to adapt to conditions that arose due to stress. To restore the energy balance, epinephrine/norepinephrine-exposed cells may face higher iron demand. So far, no direct role of epinephrine/norepinephrine in cellular iron homeostasis has been reported. Here we show that epinephrine/norepinephrine regulates iron homeostasis components such as transferrin receptor-1 and ferritin-H in hepatic and skeletal muscle cells by promoting the binding of iron regulatory proteins to iron-responsive elements present in the UTRs of transferrin receptor-1 and ferritin-H transcripts. Increased transferrin receptor-1, decreased ferritin-H, and increased iron-responsive element-iron regulatory protein interaction are also observed in liver and muscle tissues of epinephrine/norepinephrine-injected mice. We demonstrate the role of epinephrine/norepinephrine-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in converting cytosolic aconitase (ACO1) into iron regulatory protein-1 to bind iron-responsive elements present in UTRs of transferrin receptor-1 and ferritin-H. Our study further reveals that mitochondrial iron content and mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) activity are elevated by epinephrine/norepinephrine that are blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine and iron regulatory protein-1 siRNA, suggesting involvement of reactive oxygen species and iron regulatory protein-1 in this mechanism. This study reveals epinephrine and norepinephrine as novel regulators of cellular iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2004561160,"Amino acid uptake in fungi is mediated by general and specialized members of the yeast amino acid transporter (YAT) family, a branch of the amino acid polyamine organocation (APC) transporter superfamily. PrnB, a highly specific l-proline transporter, only weakly recognizes other Put4p substrates, its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue. Taking advantage of the high sequence similarity between the two transporters, we combined molecular modeling, induced fit docking, genetic, and biochemical approaches to investigate the molecular basis of this difference and identify residues governing substrate binding and specificity. We demonstrate that l-proline is recognized by PrnB via interactions with residues within TMS1 (Gly56, Thr57), TMS3 (Glu138), and TMS6 (Phe248), which are evolutionary conserved in YATs, whereas specificity is achieved by subtle amino acid substitutions in variable residues. Put4p-mimicking substitutions in TMS3 (S130C), TMS6 (F252L, S253G), TMS8 (W351F), and TMS10 (T414S) broadened the specificity of PrnB, enabling it to recognize more efficiently l-alanine, l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, and glycine without significantly affecting the apparent Km for l-proline. S253G and W351F could transport l-alanine, whereas T414S, despite displaying reduced proline uptake, could transport l-alanine and glycine, a phenotype suppressed by the S130C mutation. A combination of all five Put4p-ressembling substitutions resulted in a functional allele that could also transport l-alanine and glycine, displaying a specificity profile impressively similar to that of Put4p. Our results support a model where residues in these positions determine specificity by interacting with the substrates, acting as gating elements, altering the flexibility of the substrate binding core, or affecting conformational changes of the transport cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2022085085,"Here we demonstrate that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) interacts with calpain-1, but not with calpain-2, and forms a discrete complex in which the protease maintains its catalytic activity, although with a lower affinity for Ca2+. Equilibrium gel distribution experiments show that this complex is composed by an equal number of molecules of each protein partner. Moreover, in resting cells, cytosolic calpain-1 is completely associated with HSP90. Since calpain-1, in association with HSP90, retains its proteolytic activity, and the chaperone is displaced by calpastatin also in the absence of Ca2+, the catalytic cleft of the protease is not involved in this association. Thus, calpain-1 can form two distinct complexes depending on the availability of calpastatin in the cytosol. The occurrence of a complex between HSP90 and calpain-1, in which the protease is still activable, can prevent the complete inhibition of the protease even in the presence of high calpastatin levels. We also demonstrate that in basal cell conditions HSP90 and calpain-1, but not calpain-2, are inserted in the multi-protein N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complex. The amount of calpain-1 at the NMDAR cluster is not modified in conditions of increased [Ca2+]i, and this resident protease is involved in the processing of NMDAR components. Finally, the amount of calpain-1 associated with NMDAR cluster is independent from Ca2+-mediated translocation. Our findings show that HSP90 plays an important role in maintaining a given and proper amount of calpain-1 at the functional sites."
https://openalex.org/W1986914149,"Abstract The syndecans are a type of cell surface adhesion receptor that initiates intracellular signaling events through receptor clustering mediated by their highly conserved transmembrane domains (TMDs). However, the exact function of the syndecan TMD is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the specific regulatory role of the syndecan-2 TMD. We found that syndecan-2 mutants in which the TMD had been replaced with that of syndecan-4 were defective in syndecan-2-mediated functions, suggesting that the TMD of syndecan-2 plays one or more specific roles. Interestingly, syndecan-2 has a stronger tendency to form sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant homodimers than syndecan-4. Our structural studies showed that a unique phenylalanine residue (Phe167) enables an additional molecular interaction between the TMDs of the syndecan-2 homodimer. The presence of Phe167 was correlated with a higher tendency toward oligomerization, and its replacement with isoleucine significantly reduced the SDS-resistant dimer formation and cellular functions of syndecan-2 (e.g., cell migration). Conversely, replacement of isoleucine with phenylalanine at this position in the syndecan-4 TMD rescued the defects observed in a mutant syndecan-2 harboring the syndecan-4 TMD. Taken together, these data suggest that Phe167 in the TMD of syndecan-2 endows the protein with specific functions. Our work offers new insights into the signaling mediated by the TMD of syndecan family members."

https://openalex.org/W2004754245,"Randomized clinical trials of HIV prevention in high-risk populations of women often assume that all participants have similar exposure to HIV. However, a substantial fraction of women enrolled in the trial may have no or low exposure to HIV. Our objective was to estimate the proportion of women exposed to HIV throughout a hypothetical high-risk study population.A stochastic individual-based model was developed to simulate the sexual behavior and the risk of HIV acquisition for a cohort of sexually active HIV-uninfected women in high HIV prevalence settings. Key behavior and epidemic assumptions in the model were based on published studies on HIV transmission in South Africa. The prevalence of exposure, defined as the proportion of women who have sex with HIV-infected partner, and HIV incidence were evaluated.Our model projects that in communities with HIV incidence rate of 1 per 100 person years, only 5-6% of women are exposed to HIV annually while in communities with an HIV incidence of 5 per 100 person years 20-25% of women are exposed to HIV. Approximately 70% of the new infections are acquired from partners with asymptomatic HIV.Mathematical models suggest that a high proportion of women enrolled in HIV prevention trials may be unexposed to HIV even when incidence rates are high. The relationship between HIV exposure and other risk factors should be carefully analyzed when future clinical trials are planned."
https://openalex.org/W2027923622,"Recent studies using ClipR-59 knock-out mice implicated this protein in the regulation of muscle function. In this report, we have examined the role of ClipR-59 in muscle differentiation and found that ClipR-59 knockdown in C2C12 cells suppressed myoblast fusion. To elucidate the molecular mechanism whereby ClipR-59 regulates myoblast fusion, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using ClipR-59 as the bait and identified Elmo2, a member of the Engulfment and cell motility protein family, as a novel ClipR-59-associated protein. We showed that the interaction between ClipR-59 and Elmo2 was mediated by the atypical PH domain of Elmo2 and the Glu-Pro-rich domain of ClipR-59 and regulated by Rho-GTPase. We have examined the impact of ClipR-59 on Elmo2 downstream signaling and found that interaction of ClipR-59 with Elmo2 enhanced Rac1 activation. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that formation of an Elmo2·ClipR-59 complex plays an important role in myoblast fusion."

https://openalex.org/W1992376464,"Familial prion protein (PrP) mutants undergo conversion from soluble and protease-sensitive to insoluble and partially protease-resistant proteins. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylation of wild type PrP (pPrP) at serine 43 induces a conversion of PrP into aggregates and fibrils. Here, we investigated whether familial PrP mutants are predisposed to Cdk5 phosphorylation and whether phosphorylation of familial PrP mutants increases conversion. PrP mutants representing three major familial PrP diseases and different PrP structural domains were studied. We developed a novel in vitro kinase reaction coupled with Thioflavin T binding to amyloid structure assay to monitor phosphorylation-dependent amyloid conversion. Although non-phosphorylated full-length wild type or PrP mutants did not convert into amyloid, Cdk5 phosphorylation rapidly converted these into Thioflavin T-positive structures following first order kinetics. Dephosphorylation partially reversed conversion. Phosphorylation-dependent conversion of PrP from α-helical structures into β-sheet structures was confirmed by circular dichroism. Relative to wild type pPrP, most PrP mutants showed increased rate constants of conversion. In contrast, non-phosphorylated truncated PrP Y145X (where X represents a stop codon) and Q160X mutants converted spontaneously into Thioflavin T-positive fibrils after a lag phase of over 20 h, indicating nucleation-dependent polymerization. Phosphorylation reduced the lag phase by over 50% and thus accelerated the formation of the nucleating event. Consistently, phosphorylated Y145X and phosphorylated Q160X exacerbated conversion in a homologous seeding reaction, whereas WT pPrP could not seed WT PrP. These results demonstrate an influence of both the N terminus and the C terminus of PrP on conversion. We conclude that post-translational modifications of the flexible N terminus of PrP can cause or exacerbate PrP mutant conversion.BackgroundConversion of prion protein occurs in familial prion diseases, but the exact mechanism is unknown.ResultsPhosphorylation at the N-terminal serine 43 causes or exacerbates conversion of familial prion protein mutants.ConclusionThe N terminus and C terminus of prion protein both influence conversion into amyloid.SignificanceThe flexible N terminus of prion protein plays a role in amyloid conversion and could indicate a novel target to prevent prion conversion.
